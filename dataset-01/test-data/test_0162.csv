5,Awesome!,"My son received this from his Aunt Holly for his 7th birthday. IT IS SO MUCH FUN!!! Buying one for my nephew. The rockets really sore in the sky! Buy one!!! This toy would be great for picnics, church picnics, or any activity outside to keep the kids entertained. lol it will keep the parents entertained too!"
3,10th Birthday Present,Purchased as a birthday present for a 10 year old boy. He enjoyed it but don't think he will get it out and play with that often.
3,"Simple, but cool.","Takes alittle assembly, then you're off. Pretty simple source of entertainment for a while. I would not recommend it in the house."
3,Flimsy,Great fun but a little flimsy on the base. Have found when the kids get a bit excited then the base comes apart easily.
3,Difficult to learn from,"Overall, this book is simply awkward. The code is difficult to read and the text is hard to follow. Also, there are few, if any, practical examples. If this book wasn't required for the class that I'm taking, I would definately pass on it."
1,Depressing,"This book gave me no hope for Analysis of Algorithm and Data Structures class, i have yet to find another book to assist me in this area. the book was so-what easy to read, but the explanation of the concepts is really horrible, dont waste ur money"
1,A terrible textbook,"I would have to say that i'm very much angered by the poor quality of this ""textbook"", if it can be called a textbook. A textbook, by definition, should try to explain everything in detail as much as possible and convey the concepts in a clear and well-illustrated manner. On the contrary, this book is full of partial details in long-winded sentences, which makes a already hard topic even more difficult to follow. As a textbook, it is counter-productive. Maybe the author dont want to bother, but the lack of detail and jumping of thought is striking in this book, not to mention the incomplete, half-baked C-like Java code that does not even compile. It is a shame that it is used as a textbook anywhere, it is even a bigger shame that some school selects it as textbook for the reason other than academic."
2,Anonymous,"I would not reccomend this book for learning about data structures. With incomplete code and scampy sections on core area material, it seems to serve more as a workbook than anything else. In addition to this I find it to be poorly worded which has often caused me to overlook important details or have to read a sentence multiple times to understand what the author is saying. What saves this from being a one star product is the fact that if you do know the material, it can help you review structures but even then, the ackward wording still can slow down a quick read."
1,"Poorly written, terrible examples","I just finished using this book for my Data Structures class, and as most of the reviews say, this book is no good. The text itself is poorly written to where it is difficult to even follow small passages. The code examples in the book are horrible. Shaffer consistently uses worthless variable names, and makes plenty of errors that made it frustrating for the students and even our professor. If you must buy it for class, do so, but otherwise keep on looking for a good book."
1,This booklet is missing the target,"This booklet misses a lot of the knowledge required to effectively use Mastercam V9. Also, there are many blatant errors, not only in grammer, spelling, and graphic examples, but especially in the learning examples. A lot of your time will be wasted trying to follow the books instructions for they are inaccurate. Best to look for a better book, one with some intelligence behind it, to come along.It is evident that this booklet was written by an inexperienced authors, and was not proof-read or checked for accuracy."
2,Not so happy.,"Easily peeled a 10 lb bag of potatoes leaving few remaining skins behind that I had to clean with a hand peeler. However, no luck with apples. The Apple jammed and would not go through the corer.. the three prong rod just spun and spun inside the middle of the apple and made a mess. I'm unhappy with this purchase and have been looking for something more heavy duty and better able to do apples. Should have listened to the other reviewers."
1,BIASED LOOK AT MONEY IN POLITICS,"The entire book is basically bashing Bush on ways that he obtained fortune through politics. All evidince in the book is subjective. Sifry is a hardcore liberal, and feels that we need to get Bush out of the White House; so if you feel the same way, read this book and Sifry will brainwash you into hating Bush more than you already do."
4,A Treat For The Senses,"Although the camera work is a bit amateurish and mis-directed, as others have stated, this is a wonderful DVD and the first I saw of this incredibly talented artist. The parts that DO show his fingering and technique are amazing. I just watched the A & E Biography of Hendrix (for the eleventeenth time!) and was amazed at the technique he used was and still is unparallelled. Same with Jake. All I could think of throughout the whole dvd was, ""Wow! I'd love to hear him with Bela Fleck and the Flecktones or June Yamagishi and Papa Grows Funk."" Two other bands that like Jake, are known to a very small segment. Hey! College DJ's! Play some Jake Shimabukuro and get the national recognition going! Overall, this is an enjoyable dvd especially if you've never seen him before. And it's great to put on and queue to the playing portion---then just listen. Fantabulous!"
3,"Didn't buy yet, only providing missing song information...","Songs:Toastman's Dilemma,Equator,Sunday Morning,Skyline, Europa,Toastmaker's Revenge,Spain,Crazy G.Music Videos:Crosscurrent,Toastmaker'sDilemma,Wish upon my StarWhy can't the publisher provide the song listings? Or for that matter, if you see in the description the songs are missing and you've bought this and are already writing a review, how about giving us the song listings?"
3,Not for a Beginner,"If you want to watch the best in the world then this is a good dvd. Jake is awesome. However, if you are a beginner and you try to copy any of his lessons you will be frustrated. If you already play the ukulele than maybe you can try his moves, but if you are starting out it will be too much for you."
2,Cheap looking edition.,"This book (the same as the one shown in the picture) looks and feels like a cheesy print-on-demand book. Laminated covers, print that looks like it's done with a laser or ink-jet printer, etc."
3,"fast, fun, touching...","delightful, fast and romantic...will read this author again and highly recommend this book...forget about time, meals and loved one...just snuggle down and enjoy."
2,Canon- Great Cameras-Terrible all-in-ones,"The only reason I didn't give this all-in-one just one star is because it powered up when I hit the button. I swear by canon digital cameras (will probably never buy anything else due to my experience with their service department and the quality of the cameras themselves), but the printer left much to be desired. I use an HP a-i-o at work and LOVE IT! It's fast, great quality scans, great photo prints, great everything... Well, I ordered the canon MP150, used it for three days, boxed it up and sent it back. I was sorely disappointed. It was anything BUT user friendly, the scans were absolutely terrible, and it took up half the desk. Well, I got my new HP4180 in the mail today and I love it. Bottom line: If you're looking for a great camera, go canon. If you're looking for a great printer or all-in-one, go HP and steer clear of canon. Trust me, it'll save you a 10% restocking fee."
3,Great Printer EXCEPT for 4x6 Photos,"I have used Canon printers before - this is my third. I have always been impressed by the quality for the price. Higher priced printers are better for quality, but the price on this just outweighs that. That being said, this is my worst experience with a Canon printer. It does well for regular documents, but printing 4x6 photos is a pain. It gives a paper jam almost every time - at least 9 out of 10 times. I recommend this if you want to print documents, but if you plan on printing regular sized photos than I would look elsewhere."
3,Perfect until it broke down,"When I bought this printer, I was thrilled with it.The printing speed is quite fast once it gets past the first page (first page takes up to 1 minute), the quality is brilliant for the price, and the scanning is pretty good too, along with the great design of the printer. Installation was quick and the included photo paper was useful to see the full potential of the printer.The cartridges are some of the most expensive cartridges around, and they don't last too long. This printer broke down after 6 months, whereas my Lexmark X1185 from 2003 is still going strong.This was a perfect printer for the price, until it broke down. That takes a star or two away from it. Buy something more reliable if you can, and maybe something with cheaper ink."
4,The Ultimate User-friendly Canon MP150,This is a great printer! It has great resolution for your color photos and the printer speed is incredible. I highly recommend this printer to users who do a moderate amount of home printing.
2,The first 15 minutes are funny. Then it gets boring because most of the time the actors are just talking.,The first 15 minutes are funny. Then it gets boring because most of the time the actors are just talking. Besides the jokes are repetitive.
2,Lucky#Slevin,"Good movie, but format that Amazon claims as DTS Surround in incorrect. When I received my copy it was Dolby 5.1. Not a huge deal, but I prefer DTS and expect it when its advertised."
4,Offbeat Twists and Turns,"Lucky Slevin is anything but conventional. As it begins, you are beginning to wonder if this is just another silly character film that goes nowhere. Even good actors (Willis, Freeman) make bad movies, right? But... if you are wiling to hang in there, ""Lucky"" turns from silly to powerfully focused and the twists are really quite unpredictable. When this one is over you will think, ""Boy, better than I ever thought this would be!"" Thumbs up!"
1,Am I the only one who watched this movie?,"This movie was terrible. I went in expecting great things from a great cast, but the whole movie reeked of effort. I'm going to blame it on the writing and perhaps the direction. I mean when Josh Hartnett says something along the lines of ""I take it no one ever told you not to use the word you're trying to define in the definition"" and that was supposed to be ""smart,"" ""witty,"" and ""funny."" I knew it was over. You can really tell when someone puts in stupid references and tries to pass it off as wit. I have never written a review on Amazon (obviously I'm no critic) and it's been a while since I have seem this movie, but I am making a conscious effort to tell everyone I know not to see this movie. The entire movie is so predictable. Aside from Lucy Liu looking very nice and one memorable seen with Ben Kingsley and Morgan Freeman, this movie is awful. Please don't see it. And if you like it, please reevaluate your movie viewing decisions."
1,BROKEN,I ordered this for a Christmas gift. When I got it the DVD was out of the case. When my friend tried to play it we found that it was broken.
2,What is old is new again,"Picked up this DVD for the stars, what I got was another retelling of ""Youjimbo"" with a little twist to try to set it apart from ""Fist Full of Dollars"" or ""Last Man Standing"". Some cosmetic changes to the format, but all questions are answered if you are paying minimal attention. Overall, ""Lucky # Slevin"" is a decent 'turn off your brain for a bit' flick; a rental."
3,It's repeatable fun,"it's not a gret movie, it's not perfect, but it's enjoyable fun. Topping it off with Lucy Liu as her most adorable part in years makes it good for a repeatable film. It's not Big Trouble in Little China, or The Last Dragon (my reigning champs for the 5-10 times a year type movie)...but what is?"
3,"GOOD BUT, UNEVEN! COULD HAVE BEEN GREAT!","This is one of those movies that is really frustrating to watch. You have some great actors like Freeman,Kingsley and Willis who are interesting to watch and then you have some not so great actors like Lui and Hartnett who are not very interesting to watch. The story is good but, the love affair between Hartnett and Lui takes up way too much screen time in this otherwise good action film. I understand the purpose of the relationship between them but, it seemed to switch the tone of the movie from violent gangster film to a romantic comedy at times. Hartnett getting his nose broken twice was just too much for me and those kind of ""yuk yuk"" jokes should have been left out of this grisly tale of revenge. As it is, it's a good film but, it could have been great!"
5,How to hook a friend on romance,"Many a time I have come across people who believe romance novels are worthless and silly. Some people don't even view them as legitimate literature. I'm sure you've run across a few yourself or, perhaps you are one of those people. This book will change their perspective. When I have friends that have never read romance, I tell them to read this book and when they are through, they ask to read another, and then another, etc.... This book is so amazing. Even if you do read romance, this is worth the time to read it. And if you're a Jude fan, it is her best novel ever written. I am in love with Nicholas Stafford!"
5,Every Romantic Historian's Dream...,"I am a history major, accenting my major in Elizabethan England. One can imagine how boring this can become at times! However, after reading A Knight in Shining Armor, I remembered why I cherish this time period!The beauty, romance, spirit and chivalry of this novel is unbeatable! I have loved every book of Miss Deveraux's that I have read, however, this is the only one that I have read 16 times!The first time I read it, I opened it and did not put it down until the story ended.I recommend this book above and beyond all, especially for those who like to be taken away to a world of romance, intrigue and sheer pleasure."
4,It really expressed the limitless boundaries of love,"I thought it was very romantic and realistic, even though it deals with time travel, which I don't usually choose to read about. I found it interesting the way that Nicholas Stafford and Dougless travelled into each other's time in order to clear Nicholas' reputation from being a womanizer and sleazy. It had a great plot."
1,Gah! joining the minority here,"I'm in agreement with all the 1-star reviews here. The main character was pathetic and just cried ALL THE TIME. Who wants to read about that? Also, how she acted in the 16th century was completely unrealistic! (do you think she can run around in a different era doing whatever she wants and get away with it?)If you are looking for a book like Outlander (which I was) and love it for it's richness, vibrant characters and in-depth portrayal of the times - I recommend staying away."
2,I paid 25 and I want my money back,"I picked up several Jude Deveraux novels at a library book sale. ""Knight in Shining Armor"" was the worst of the lot. Admittedly, I am not a great fan of time-travel romance, but this book totally ridiculous. Come on, people--Dougless travels 400 years back in time with her handbag, which just happens to contain a drugstore full of toiletries? I just wasn't convinced by the plot, and the characters were not that interesting to me either. I'll take a Judith McNaught or an Amanda Quick novel any day."
5,Jude's BEST bar far!,"I read this book about 20 years ago (yes) and I absoulutley loved it then and never forgot it. I recently started reading some older books again and came across it on a best romance book list and figured I would read it again. Boy am I glad I read it again. It is whithout a doubt one of the best, best books' that I have ever read (romance books). You will fall in love with the characters and not be able to put it down. OMG, I am having withdrawls from it, lol :) Jude puts a few words in at the end and explains where the idea came and how she incorporated alcholism into the storyline. I would have never guessed but it all made perfect sense when she explains it. KEEPER!"
5,Wonderful,I think I've read every one of Mrs. Deveraux's books and this is by far the best of hers or any other author I've read. This book made me laugh and cry. it's really great. Don't miss it. buy the hardcover b/c it's a keeper!!!! I've read it over and over.
4,"Memorable , Deveraux's best","This is the first romance novel I've read that involved time travel and other impossible things.I read this when i was 13...16 years ago. I still remember the scenes (like Dougless performing Broadway tunes for the Lady/Earl's mother) and showering in the fountain... or Nicholas traipsing around the english countryside in his armor. I must have read it more than 10 times. Its truly riveting!Some people were harsh in judging this book... i like to think that Deveraux is a realist with her characterizations, plots and devices, and in the end, a big sappy romantic. She even believes in souls meeting forward, backwards and reincarnation.The best part is, she made me believe it too! :) LOVE CONQUERS ALL!!!!!!If you can only read 5 romance novels in your life, this has GOT TO BE one of them."
5,The best romance novel ever--one to share with your friends,"This romance has everything, intrigue,murder, and love that never dies. The historical details make you feel as if you are in the story. I have read this story at least 5 times and have bought this book as a present for many of my friends.I have even had a few of my boyfriends read it and they love it too. When your finished with the book you feel sad that it's all over. I would reccommend this book to anyone who lives for romance. I wish they would make it into a movie!!"
5,Excellent Time Traveling love story,"If you adores romance and time traveling story, you will adore this book."
2,in poor conditions,i was displeased to see that the book was in worse conditions then i was promised. i really wish that in its description someone would have made it more clear that the book was beat up.
4,A passionate book of love that transcends time.,"A Knight in Shining Armor is one of Jude Deveraux's best books. She weaves the tale of a hopelessly romantic American who wants to find love. So she sends her a knight.A knight in armor. So what if he is from another century. They love each other almost from their first meeting. Douglas teaches Nicholas how to be a modern man, and he teaches her how to love. After a night of passionate love, he gets sent back to his own time. Desperate and disconsolate, Douglas finds herself in his time. Doing the same things all over again, learning to like each other first and then to love. They are soul mates in the true sense of the word. This book will have you on the edge of your seat, and not just from the fiery love scenes either, but from the beautiful, poignat way it is written. If you do not shed a few tears at the end of this book, you have not truly experienced it in all its beauty."
3,Actually..3 1/2 stars.......,"I loved ""A Knight in Shining Armor""...What a romantic story...definitely not what one would label ""fluffy"". Can you imagine being so meant for someone that even the enormous obstacle of 4 centuries cannot stand in your way? Wow!! I would have gladly given this story 5 stars had the ending been different...however..the way this story was resolved left me so apalled and disappointed..I had to knock off 1 and 1/2 stars to make up for it...would I recommend this book? Yes...but be forewarned....it might not be exactly what you expect it to be."
5,The best romance ever!,"I have read many romance novels, and this one is the ONLY one I have read more than one time! I absolutely loved it, and HATED to see it end! The entire book is so charming, and the historical things she puts in are right on the money! Would make a great movie!"
4,Heartwarming,"This book sucked me in from the beginning. I would have given the book five stars, but I found Dougless Montgomery annoying at times and too desperate. Nicholas ended up being a great hero and the storyline was romantic. I enjoyed the dialogue in this book between the characters but especially between Nicholas and Dougless. Definitely the best Jude Deveraux book I have read."
2,I was very dissappointed,I love all of Jude Deveraux's books and I am her number one fan. I started reading this book and I just couldn't get into it because it was just so unbelievable. I kept reading it and finally just quit. It was boring and dissappointing. I read all the great reviews on it and got all excited so I went straight to the library to get it. Do not read this book if you like books that are half-way believable.
1,How stupid and predictable could one book be?,"I have never read such a stupid book. I admit at times I dapple in reading romance novels, but lets get real the lady screams I need a knight in shining armor and he falls out of the bushes. I am embarrassed to say I read this book, and you should be too!!!!"
2,vague and dull,"It certainly sounded exciting. Unfortunately, it's mostly a bunch of long winded articles on vague ideas that you've already thought of a hundred times. That's not to say that the ideas aren't important. I was simply expecting something a bit more focused by an author willing to take some risks. On the bright side, the book won't become dated for quite some time."
3,Way too shallow,"I think this book lacks so many aspects. A case is presented, but facts and statistics easily hide important parts that are totally left out. Partly caused by a lack of space, but it feels like he didn't bother find out all the facts.I also miss supertrends. I think that for exemple empathy is a supertrend that should be on the list."
2,Could have been great,I was attracted to this book because of the clever title and great illustrations. I read it to my 4-year-old and she lost interest by page 2. The author used words that I would say are more for the 7+ age group. It was just too hard to follow. I was really disappointed because it could have been so great but wasn't. I can't recommend this book.
3,Descent Bookcase,"First, the above poster's comments are not correct, the item does not cost more to ship than the bookcase costs (shipping was around $65). The item was ordered on 6/12 and it arrived at my house on 6/23, so delivery was faster than expected. It came in 2 boxes, one really large box weighing 70 pounds, and a smaller box that just contained the smaller spacer shelves.A couple of notes:1) The description says ""may require assembly""... This is incorrect, it definately requires assembly. You will need a screwdriver and a hammer.2) The quality is just so-so. The back is made out of that really thin thin wood that you tack onto the back. I was expecting something much more substantial.3) There is a tag on it saying that the manufacturer is Coaster Fine Furniture, and the website is coastercompany dot comAll in all, it is a descent unique bookcase and perfect for my kids room. Lots of cubbies to store his stuff in."
4,Soul stirring!,"As a fellow composer, performer and musician, I am deeply moved by your marvelous works. They no doubt come from deep within your soul just as all great artists have discovered as they followed their hearts. I commend your efforts and wish you every success.Jim JenkinsThe Lotus Co.Seattle, WA"
1,Disappointing film,"The title of the film and the cast would seem to portend a fun and interesting movie. Alas, this is not the case. The story line is such an over-used one, with quirky patches, and the acting is barely adequate. What a waste of such a talent as Scott Thompson. I was disappointed in the film from beginning to end and actually had to almost discipline myself to watch it to the end, since I had purchased it. After considering it, I later decided to watch it again, and my reaction hadn't changed, but knowing what was coming seemed to make the movie even more insipid."
3,If straight movies were gay....,"Many people find this movie too gross and sleazy. But what it is is a gay version of ""American Pie"" and is no more gross than that film. It's just more GAY! And just like ""American Pie"" it is just as dumb and juvenile.It has some amusing scenes and some just gross out scenes but only one truly funny scene... where one of the guys has picked up a muscle-bound club junkie who does some poppers and collapses while dancing to too loud thumping club music. The EM guys who arrive on the scene [also hunky] fight over who's gonna revive him with mouth to mouth and the prep for the defibrillator is hysterical. [They use sexual lube] No sooner revived, they all instantly start dancing to the pounding club beat.... while the protagonist looks on all this in horror. Too funny. But alas, that's it."
2,Potty humor and butt crack,"Well this was a pretty ""fleshy"" movie. Funny, and juvenile, lots of dic# jokes, fart jokes and butt sex jokes. I really liked the loud fat lesbian, but then again who doesn't like a loud fat lesbian. It was kind of what I expected. I dont think too many straight people would appreciate it. I thought it had some pretty funny moments."
4,Very funny!,"I mean what were u expecting about this movie? a Fellini piece of art? duh. It's just a parody of teenage movies in general but with a twist from the gay point of view. It's hilarious, irreverent and fairly well acted and that should be enough for a light comedy like it."
3,High Lonesome Yule,"Though not particularly a fan of this genre, I've enjoyed this album and would recommend it to others. Most tracks are simple, acoustic pieces in a ""real country"" style, not overproduced. ""Beautiful Star of Bethlehem"" is haunting and lovely--worth the price by itself!"
4,"if you're a fan of the bands, this is splendid","DVD is just stellar for music titles, thanks to the ability to jump to individual songs (not to mention the far superior sound quality). From The Basement ($14.98; Eagle Rock) is a great example, a music shown seen on the IFC channel which -- much like Live From Abbey Road -- lets you feel like you're getting to sit in on a private rehearsal with a band. The show has no host or audience and unlike Abbey Road there's not even a brief chat about their music. They just set up and perform. But it's wonderfully intimate with the bands ranging from radiohead to the White Stripes to Eels and Beck and other like-minded indies. Damien Rice is almost satirically mellow by kneeling on the floor to play his songs and why did I never notice before that Meg White sticks out her tongue when drumming? Great fun if you like these artists."
5,What's Not Love!,This is an incredible classic and should be in every music lover's library. I have the vinyl and decided that I should have this on CD to listen during my commute. I am so glad that Amazon.com made it available for purchase.
4,Time Out - Dave Brubeck,"I heard ""Time Out"" when I was very young during HS years. Dave's music appeals to every generation. Excellent jazz music which I recommend for anyone"
5,"Jazz classic, plain and simple","I bought this remastered CD over 10 years ago, and it is still one of my favorite classic jazz albums of all time. My Dad (now 72) had this in vinyl, and along with other great albums in his jazz collection, this one really stood out (thus my motivation to get the CD!). What can I say more than anyone else probably has...the stuff going on here was groundbreaking stuff, and it is so cool to listen to this today and say 'this freakin rocks'. Dave Brubeck was way ahead of his time, and it was sad to see his recent passing. I am a jazz fan, and have not been fond of what has become today's 'jazz sound' (aka 'smooth jazz')...I do enjoy some Kenny G now and then, but the REAL jazz is stuff like this, and it just doesn't sell whatever the radio station has to sell, so you just gotta buy great jazz like this and listen to it in the privacy of your own home/Ipod/where-ever.Take Five and buy this - NOW!"
1,Gag Reel???,Extras on this disc include: A Gag Reel. WRONG. Actually there are two. The other being the 103 minutes long movie.
4,A flawed but enjoyable action/fantasy flick,"I honestly thought ""The Last Airbender"" was a much better movie than the enthusiastically negative reviews would have you believe (and I guarantee they wouldn't have been nearly as bad if the director's name wasn't M. Night Shyamalan - people love to hate on him these days). I haven't watched the original Nickelodeon series, so I can't comment on how well it adapts the story; I know this movie covers the events of season one. But all in all I found it to be a very enjoyable, if flawed, young adult fantasy/action film (like ""The Golden Compass""). And it made me really want to check out the TV series. Give it a shot and go into it with an open mind, and you'll probably have a good time."
4,Good movie!,"Caveat to my review is that I have never seen an Avatar cartoon and know nothing about the history.I always hesitated buying this movie b/c of the reviews here, even when it dropped to $3.99 on Amazon. I ended receiving this as a Christmas gift.If you can get over the fact that the majority of the characters in the movie are not asian, as you have black, white, indian, etc. doing martial arts, then this is a decent movie.Please note that the end of the movie leaves you hanging. I am hoping part 2 is released soon."
1,Wow,I am sincerely disappointed in anyone who rated this over 1 star. As a fan of the series I feel like M Night Shaymalan punched my puppy in the stomach.
4,This isnt the cartoon,I thought the movie was pretty good. I am a fan of the tv series and their are a few things they could have done differently but overal I think he did a good job. Everywhere is forgetting that it isnt going to be the television series word for word on the big screen. COME ON NOW! So theres 1 and 2 star comments are pretty ridiculous and your being very over dramatic. Also you can clearly see there is going to be more than one film so why try and cram everything into one film. Everywhere needs to take a chill pill and take the movie for what it is.
4,Great film!,"Of course they can't cram everything into this film but it still follows the original closely. Die hard fans will complain but for the rest of us, it's not an issue."
1,M. Nightmare,The original animated show is incredible. One of the best shows of our generation. The film version was one of the worse movie adaptations of all time. M. Night changed the names of characters and plot lines. The acting was horrible. It was as if everyone involved did not watch or respect the original production. This movie will win worse movie of the year. I don't even want to see a movie from this director ever again. So my advice is to watch the animated series and avoid the live action version.
1,Like Percy Jackson all over again,"Before I start, I need to say that I am OBSESSED with the anime and love the dynamic characters. I feel like they could have made this movie a billion times better! The names were pronounced wrong which was very annoying especially to hear ""Uhng"" every time the avatars name was said. This show is amazingly popular and just like Percy Jackson fans, another epic fail and disappointment. I've heard rumors book 2 is coming out but I'm not sure. Anyone know? Anyways, I was younger when I saw this movie but I hadn't watched all the avatar shows until a year back. Me and my friend were talking about the movie and we couldn't even describe it! It was so terrible that we were open mouthed."
2,Okay for Children,"The whole family have been fans of the anime series and just today we sat down to see what THE LAST AIRBENDER looked like with a 'real people cast'.The best parts of the movie, in my opinion, were the special effects. It was cute to see MoMo and Apa on screen, and the bending effects were very well done. BUT oh the cinematography. It was awful made-for-TV quality. I suppose they shot their budget on the special effects, but that was a horrific mistake that was because the lack of good lighting and the bad panning made the actors look bad.Children won't notice the bad directing or the bad production qualities however. Although they might notice that the plotting is a bit slow.FINAL WORDS::: Watch it, don't buy it. The anime series was much better.Pam T~mom/review-bender"
5,Loved this Movie....can't wait for a part II of it,"I haven't seen the series, however I really enjoyed this movie. I really don't know why some people rate it so low. It was entertaining and enjoyable for the entire family. I would recommend this movie."
2,Skipped too much,"It wasn't worth watching--I watched the first thirty minutes, but didn't finish it--I have very little free time and did not want to waste it by finishing this awful movie--the plot was skimpy and not fleshed out--I understand that this is a Nickelodeon movie, but they still could have fleshed out the characters better---"
1,"Save yourself the trouble, I mean it","The critics are right about this one. And I'm pretty generous when it comes to certain films, but this one a polished turd.Do yourself a favor and rent this on Netflix if you want to watch it that bad. If you have never seen or heard of the Last Airbender Series or just have low movie standards then there is a slim chance you might actually like the movie, but even avid movie watchers will tell you it's pretty shoddy. The only thing interesting may be some special effects and that's about it. It's pretty much a rushed story, poorly acted, cheesy film based on the Avatar: The Last Airbender animated series. (Which I recommend getting instead. You'll feel WAY more satisfied with the storyline.) Or better yet, go watch James Cameron's Avatar, at least it will be worth the money."
2,After school special at best,"While Shamalan had potential at first, he's put out so many stinkers it just sad. This movie is slow, the characters have no charisma, no flow...the movie jumps here and there to very little purpose. It picks up the last half hour but not enough to save the film. This maybe would appeal to young kids 6-10 as an after school special."
3,Okay as a movie in its own right,"I hadn't watched the TV series before I watched this movie. On its own merits, the movie actually wasn't too bad. But after watching the TV series now, I realize why so many people didn't like it. Drastic changes to characterization, pronunciation, mood and pacing just made it seem like an entirely different interpretation of the original - almost like it was competing with, not completing the TV series. As a continuation of the TV series I would rate it as 1 out of 5, as a movie in its own right it was quite enjoyable albeit a little hard to follow in places."
2,dvd,the dvd had enough scratches on the edge that it did not want to play correctly. it was not in the shape that it was advertised
4,This is for all the 'haters',"Honestly children, if you prefer the cartoons, you have no sense of real life, anyway. Well acted movie, cool story line (needs a sequel, obviously), but choppy edting. Indeed, like other epics (let's think Dune, folks), hard to cram a large panorama into a 90 mintue movie, but it did a pretty good job. Well worth the watch."
1,Terrible everything,"For the love of god get the cartoon series instead. This movie has bad actors, bad cinematography, bad script, bad everything. The three cartoon seasons are a 5 star rating. If you got to see this bad movie do yourself a favor and rent it."
4,THIS MOVIE WAS AWESOME!,"I haven't watched the cartoon (yet) getting the dvd's, but loved the movie, I was told compared to the cartoon the movie was lame, but if you haven't seen the cartoons watch the flick, great movie."
1,Director failed to direct the actors...,"75% of this movie is a green screen, it the worst green screen effects I have seen in a large scale movie. The first movies ever made with green screens where done better.I cant understand why these actors are in any movie, they can not even do the one line script. More like a script with a bunch of one word lines, back and forth till you want to push the mute button. I think the director needs to find a new line of work. good idea of a movie, but fails in every way and then some. I going to tell people to buy it just to see how crappy it really is."
1,Total garbage,"Crappy plotCrappy dialogueCrappy actingCrappy fight scenesCrappy ""3D"".Notice any trends?Don't waste any money on this, as they should be paying you to watch it."
2,I walked out of the theatre.,"I walked out of the theater. I will give it one star for having a beginning middle and end, and a second only because I walked out on my first attempt to observe it. The second attempt did not swallow any easier.Simply put, if you consider yourself a die hard fan of the series watching this debacle will be painful. m night shyamalan clearly did not enjoy the series as much as i did or he would have killed this movie in mid-production.If you by chance are not a fan or are knew to the series then feel free to enjoy this movie. Actors where capable especially Zukos and Sokka's, wasnt a fan of Aang(pronounced with a hard A, not Ong...really NMS, really?)."
3,So Sue Me.....I Actually Enjoyed It,"I read horrible reviews for this movie. But it was in the redbox and I picked it up on bluray. I have to say that acting isn't very good, and I don't know the original story, but even with those strikes against it I thought it was defitely watchable and great as a popcorn flick.Just upset that we probably won't get to see the finished story since this was suspposedly a box office failure.Here's to hoping they keep it coming and it does good on dvd sales so they finish it/"
2,"primitive plot, good visiual, and non-existent 3D","It is a typical fantasy film, kind of a fairy tale, with very simple and predicatable plot. At the end of the movie the stage is set for a sequel and it is amazingly obvious what will happen in the sequel, down to the details, based on the simplicity of the plot of the movie.The movie is reasonably entertaining for adults and suitable for kids. There is a fair amount of action but mostly non-violent (or does not appear to be violent). The computer graphics and visuals are very nice. It could be a decent film to watch in 2D. However, 3D is possibly the worse from all 3D films released so far. The image is astonishingly flat, and computer graphics takes absolutely no advantage of 3D possibilities. Don't waste your money on the 3D version.By the way, on one of the web site this movie got multiple ""awards"" - the worst film of the year and the worst 3D of the year. Not sure about the first one, but the second one is well deserved."
3,good movie,it is okaylike the musicloved the movie in the theatreit is a great movie but i dont feel like watching it again
1,BIG MISTAKE,"All i can say is that if i could have given this movie zero stars i would have. HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT! Any fans of the tv series should feel the same. I pray that they don't decide to do books 2 and 3. jeez, it hurts just to think about how suckish this movie was."
5,The Last Airbender dvd,It came in a resonable amount of time and the price was right. I have watched it several times since receiving it and the quality is excellent. This was my first purchase from Amazon and because of service plan to use again.
5,Awesome visual effects on HDTV,"The visual effects are as-advertised, and it's a great feel-good story, with a little bit of a cliff-hanger. Two thumbs up!"
4,did not see the original,"As a person (adult) who never saw the original animated series from which this movie derives, I must say that this is not a bad movie. The visual effects are often very beautiful and imaginative. I especially like the ships of the Fire Nation. And, the scenes that were filmed in Greenland are very beautiful. I must admit that there are not many interesting characters, other than Prince Zuko. But, all of the acting is decent, and the special effects are not over-done. I even like the music score, which is better than average. I think that we have to remember what type of movies M. Night Shyamalan likes to make--movies that are low-keyed (in terms of action and dialogue) and with lots of atmosphere. I feel that this movie fits that description."
1,I want to take away stars.,"There should be negative stars for this film. What MNS did to this story is what drive people to mass murder and suicide. Garbage. Please Aang Lee, remake this film series!!!"
3,It's Ok,i chose a 3 star rating due to it being better than i thought it would bethe biggest gripe is m.night changing the pronunciation of the chars....
2,THAT'S IT M.NIGHT!! YOU'VE REALLY DONE IT!!!,"What's happening to him?! After his glory of ""The Sixth Sense, Signs, and Lady in the Water,"" WHAT'S MAKING HIM FAIL?!?! ""The Last Airbender"" is boring, dumb special effects, but stays up. In English, it's mostly bad but it has some interest. Still, it's a complete mindless failure that packs a dumb punch. Anyone who desperatly needs to sleep; go buy it."
2,Great...For Bad Movie Night,"When I saw that they were making movies for the ""Avatar"" series, I was immidiatly excited. I had been a fan of the anime for years and couldn't wait to see the movie. It sucked. First, the movie ended right when Azula was ordered to look for Aang. I would not complain if they said it would just be book one. Apart from that, acting was pretty bad, effects were cheezy, and the characters mispronounced ALOT of names. Would not recomend"
1,"step all over a great story, then show your dirty footprints?","step all over a great story, then show your dirty footprints? bad,bad. watch the animation by nick. Classic great fable."
2,Badly written script,"The script did not do justice to the original Avatar. I could not find fault in scenery and special effects; the back-end crew did their job. Here are the reason for poor rating:- need tighter script, doesn't seem to be written in native English tongue.- need better directing, poor camera angles to highlight character emotions to convey message- need better post cut, amateur editing/cutting job only concentrate on action scenes but not character dialogueGood thing it was free through Amazon Prime.If they continue with the 2nd movie, replace the writer, director, and editing house on this first movie. Then, I will reconsider purchase it and forgive their poor judgement on the first cut."
2,Monochromatic,"Everyone's written excellent reviews on this movie already, and they are utterly true. I haven't watched all of the cartoon series, so I'm not as emotionally invested in it, and it gets two stars for special effects. The day that I don't get some entertainment out of watching magical swooshy water/air being moved by fake martial arts is the day that my soul dies.What I did come here to say, though, is WHY ARE KATARA/SOKKA WHITE? Come on! There can't possibly even BE a reason to have only one race in the main characters other than the people who made casting decisions are scared of brown skin. Come ON! The water tribe's coloring is so cool, and they ruined it!In summary, watch the cartoon, or else watch the magic bits of the movie and sort of squint through all of the parts where they've bleached everyone. And plug your ears if anyone is talking.**terrible acting, as covered in the other reviews."
2,This COULD have been a great movie,"You know, I really wanted to like this movie. I read the other reviews and thought ""These are written by people who've been watching the cartoon series for years...that's why they don't like the movie!""Never having watched the cartoon series, I thought I'd really like this movie. But I was wrong. This movie has great special effects and a great concept behind it. However, it's the SCRIPT that sucks. There is pretty much no character development, and the emotions the characters DO express seem to come out of the blue, are melodramatic and well, they just don't seem to FIT. The dialogue is just so awkward.I give this movie 2 stars for the basic concept of it and the special effects. It wasn't a TOTAL waste of time...but it was pretty bad."
1,Why can't I rate this 0/5?,"HORRIBLE.Oh dear god, I saw this years ago and my eyes are still in pain. I wouldn't recommend this movie in countries that outlaw torture."
2,Only watchable with Rifftrax.,"A cataclysm of awfulness. I don't even know where to begin on this awful movie. The dialogue and acting is a failure on every level, not only failing to keep you engaged, but also failing to make sense at times. The story is comprised of major events from the Avatar TV show, the problem being that the show had 20 episodes to develop itself and the movie has just under two hours. The movie's one possible saving grace would have been the effects, but even those are just average.The only way I recommend seeing the film is with the genius comedy of MST3K stars Mike Nelson, Kevin Murphy, and Bill Corbett over at [...]. At least then you can intentionally watch a comedy instead of unintentionally watching a train wreck."
1,Should have been a single (at best),"This has got to be the single worst CD I have bought in the last 5 years. Most of it is pointless, meandering sub elph vs Coil glitch-style electronica.However, just when you think you've lost the will to live, the one track with any kind of tune, and a vocal performance ""One night domination"", comes along and bumbles along quite nicely.That, sadly, is the only highlight."
5,stunning,"The articulation and cohesion of this young group is stunning. The works on this disc are infused with a passionate, youthful exuberance so lacking in other performances of these works. These guys gives Orpheus a run for their money. Must buy."
1,shocked!,"i really want to buy this sedu flat iron. i placed the order on 27 sept and expected it to arrive in thailand on 1 to 7 oct. but out of the blue, i received email from folica and amazon that my order was cancelled, without any explanation, but my credit card was not charged. can anyone tell me what is going on? i sent email to folica and amazon, but so far, no feed back from them yet. SOS."
5,amazing,"I bought these in november 2009 and have now lasted 2 and a half years - absolutely amazing wiper blade - I just now feel the need to get some refills although they are still wiping decently, I just got used to them being perfect and am going to replace - much cheaper in long run than other brads"
5,KA-BAR Knife,"This commemorative KA-BAR knife was a gift for my husband, it is a wonderful keepsake and he was very pleased with it."
4,One of the three or four best episodes of The Outer Limits..,"Filmed on a stark, almost bare stage, Nightmare belies it's low budget with bizarre, dreamlike atmosphere, powerfully paranoid suspence, and almost unbelievably good ensemble acting. Outer Limits fans sometimes overlook this one. Don't miss it."
3,Nightmare episode,"I was a little disappointed when watching the much-touted NIGHTMARE episode online. The acting and the lighting are good. The Ebonites would definately give children a scare. That said, I think, whatever merits of this story by Joseph Stefano, are sabotaged by a weak third act which lets all the air out of the balloon. It's almost like those stories where we find out it was all just a dream. Almost. But other than that, it was interesting to watch. (And a young Martin Sheen was already a better actor than his sons would ever be!) It probably could have played better as an hour and a half or two episode show."
4,Interesting information,"The book certainly contains interesting information, and makes you think about the basis of western economies. The first couple of chapters seemed a little trivial as they did not present any new information for me, and it seemed like the author was repeating the same point over and over again. After the inital hump, it got better and the author does do a good job of describing the developing of the property system in the U.S., which was qutie interesting."
1,De Soto forgets about risk management and market liquidity,"De Soto, observing that ""the single most important source of funds for new businesses in the United States is a mortgage on the entrepreneur's house"", concludes that by providing real estate property titles to poor people, they will have access to the same type of funds from banks.He forgets two important facts:1) Banks take into consideration the credit worthiness of the entrepreneur asking for the loan. A poor person in a shanty town with a business idea of starting a fruit stand will not be considered credit worthy by any commercial bank.2) Banks take into consideration the real estate market liquidity when making a property-backed loan. If the real estate market is not liquid, the bank cannot liquidate the property in case of a loan default. I'm willing to bet that the real estate market in a shanty town is less than hot.We should always bear in mind that economics is hard."
5,impressive!,"""Impressive book and well worth the time to read. Property rights is the key difference in why capitalism works in the West and Japan but has failed in former Communist Staes and most of the Third World. The author shows that even where there are no property rights (think the slums of Brazil or The Congo), there are property ownership outside the law. If the governments made it easier for individuals to own property, this unleashed capital would benefit the government and those already wealthy as more wealth will be created. Well researched."""
5,Inspirational Music,"Have been looking for this magnificent cd for years. Now that it has been re-released this month, I'm thrilled to be able to purchase it. It brings the true meaning to Christmas right into your home."
5,great work,nusrat fateh ali khan appears on this Cd..i didnt know that before...i think this is his best work...Mahmood is an awesome writer/producer...the sound is crisp and catchy......
4,Cinderella's Secret Baby,"Carolyn Zane has hit gold with the Series The Brubaker Brides! There's nothing more enjoyable to read about then sexy, rich, texan, men and they come from a lager lovable family to make it even better! This series just keeps getting better and Cinderalla's Secret Baby proves that. It's just like a fairy tale when Mac Brubaker finds his true love, and right in his fathers kicthen too! It's so romantic how before the end of the second chapter they have run off for a secrect wedding. But like all good things their wirlwind courtship had to come to an end. Soon Ella is fleeing that great state of Texas...and taking Mac's unborn child with her! Just wait and see the sparks fly when Mac finally finds his very pregnat bride! The only thing I would change about this book would be to have more of Big Daddy, the lovable funny patriark of the Burbaker clan in this book. Fairy tales really do come true and I promise this one wont let you down!"
2,An adventure in a medieval World,"In Caldor planet, immorality is assured only to the few winners of a cruel flight from a labyirinth. The protagonist partecipates to give endless live to an old rich king, but the final choice will be different."
4,"the review by Ed wright is excellent, but somewhat unsympathetic","I have little to add to the wonderful review by Edward Wright... until the point where ""unimpressive"" and later "" juvenile"" are used. Rihm is perhaps our greatest living composer. To have a glimpse of his always impressive early "" hunts"" is a treasure. Nothing here disappoints. Rihm finds new forms in his hunts which is the basis of all his music ( maybe his Violin Cto is an exception so accesible is it ). With each new piece my goosebumps become mountains. Unlike Wright , I have listened to the music many times before reading the self-deprecating liner notes. None are lacking; all are facinating. Simply this is a must for those who will eventually make their way to "" Jagden und Formen "" . And if you don't own and cherish the latter, one of the greatest pieces of contemporary music, then there is no sense in revelling in his earlier constructs. Rihm is not for everyone, though he should be. Rihm is a genius."
1,Music but no words,"I haved loved Seefried's unaffected, somewhat boyish singing from my LP days. It is good to hear these very clear CD transcriptions,which bring her back right into my sitting room. However, beware that there are no texts or translations which is cheap on the part of the record company. Unless you are very fluent in German it is not possible to enjoy lieder without texts because the marriage of words and music is what lieder is all about. I managed to find most of them by hunting around in my LP collection and in a useful book, The Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau Book of Lieder, but drew a blank at the Bartok cycle!"
4,Good book!,I saw the movie Murderball AND read Gimp. Incredible! I used to play hockey until I was in an accident so I can REALLY relate to Zupan. His story is an inspiration to all people dealing with a life altering circumstance.
4,An unique perspective of a dark soul,"This is a unique work which is presented entirely in character monologue, diary entries and media clippings, all of which relate to one Herman Mudgett, a man of many names and one dark purpose. To read of Herman's nonchalant attitude toward killing is equally chilling than being given blow-by-blow accounts of his misdeeds, and that for me was the true horror.The structure of this novel may remind some of Stephen King's Carrie, which was written in a similar way. All in all, the book is a quick yet engrossing read."
3,Missing aspects I was looking for.,"After doing lots of reading from investing books, I wanted to learn more about the REIT asset class of investments. This book had some good information, but the main information I was looking for was how taxes are reported and why they are fairly complicated. The author only gave a two page appendix on taxes. I felt like he spent way too much time on why you should invest in REIT's and the aspects of when to buy and what to look for individual REIT's and not the big picture of owning REIT's in an mutual fund or REIT index fund. I was more concerned on how taxes affect your investment's location (Taxable vs. Tax Advantaged) and that was totally ignored. Dissapointed."
5,As Promised,"This item was as described and works well with our mat cutter. Quick service, no need to contact the buyer."
2,"Low quality, slide storage box","I paid approximately 30 for this and am disappointed in the quality. Made of flimsy sheet metal (and I do mean flimsy), the whole thing boasts of asian quality throughout. The top cover doesn't close correctly, latches are poorly aligned, and the paint finish is.. well, un-finished. The white paper you see attached to the pictured unit must have been glued-on by the photographer, because it sure as heck doesn't come that way. Avoid this, unless you just can't find any better."
3,Difficult to read book,"I purchased this book because everyone was speaking how great it was. When i got it though, i found it almost impossible to read, it is not very nicely printed and the English Niveau is high. Since i am not a native English speaker that makes it difficult. Another thing i have to say is that the diagrams are easy. Most of the stuff i already know so i didnt bother to look at it. This book just didnt have that magnet to me. I really dont see why most people reward it with 5 stars !? There are much better books now a days and this book surely ISNT THE BIBLE OF CHESS!!"
4,Make me into a Master!,"I have met hundreds of Grand-Masters over the years. Literally. I usually harangue the poor fellows, and pester them with zillions of questions. One of the questions I always ask is usually, ""If I were to read one chess book, which one would you recommend?"" Nine times out of ten, the answer is, ""Read Nimzovich's, 'My System.'"" One of my students recently presented me with a copy of this book, thinking I was not familiar with it. (Of course I had read it over 25 years ago!) I went through it again. Like all the GM's have told me, this book will make a MUCH BETTER player out of you! Its made Category I players into Masters, and turned Masters into GM's. One of the very often over-looked facts is that this book will teach you the FUNDAMENTALS of STRATEGY and PLANNING!! Get it. I can guarantee if you will spend just a little time with it, you will not be sorry."
5,A classic book passing down fundamental ideas in chess,"This is a classic. The influence of Nimzovich's writing is undisputed. The fundamental ideas which are described in Nimzovich's book provide a background of tools and ideas for the modern tournament player. Rook on the 7th for example, is a phrase often quoted by chess players World wide. The idea of ""overprotection"" of a strong point, and ""blockade"", and of the pawn ""chain"" all provide chess ""technology"" which will definitely have a positive impact on a chess player's strength. This is definitely not a book for opening parrots! It is book for people who wish to deepen their knowledge of the fundamentals of chess."
4,Read & Think Spanish; Book 1,This book is an excellent tool for spanish instructors and students. I am pleased with the writing text along with the video. I am very pleased.Este libro es un excelente ayuda y muy bueno para profesores y estudiantes tambien. Estoy muy alegro....
3,Feedback on the Recordings,"The readings represent a beautiful overview of cultural information and activities that take place over the range of Spanish-speaking countries. The readings are clear. Of equal importance, the recordings are not cluttered with explanations in English, background noises, and music--just straight reading in Spanish from story to story.There is one flaw: The back blurb of the book says ""you will read and listen to more than 100 articles in Spanish about the enchanting diversity of Latino culture."" This blurb dishonestly gives the impression that all articles are recorded on the CD. In reality, of the 117 articles, only 29 are read on the enclosed CD.It is perfectly all right to record only a portion of the articles for readers to listen to, but this fact should have been stated honestly so that customers would not be mislead before making their purchase."
5,Rd Thnk Span,"Delightful book and CD. It enhances the learning process, is interesting and fun to read and listed to the CD, and it very much increases ones understanding of hispanic culture and its variability among the Spanish-speaking countries of the world. If you are just a bit past beginning but still less than intermediate, or if you are intermediate or even advanced, I think you will enjoy the book and CD."
5,The Elephant in the Living Room,"The untold story of China's destitute rural peasant majority. The part of China remains the unacknowledged elephant-in-the-living-room in too many discussions of the Chinese economy, which tend to focus exclusively on the urban industrial sector with which the West trades. This book helps to complete the picture of what is happening in China."
4,Its a fine grain,"Its good, it really is good but 50 iso is crazy low for me, so I pushed it some just 1 stop to 100, i might try 200. but 100 worked for me."
3,"OK, But More Background To Explain Actions","Always on the search for good women thriller writers, I picked this up because of the intriguing plot synopsis. I found it a decent read, but not an exceptional one like Linda Fairstein or Alex Kava. There was too little background on what 'made' the Protagonist, why she feels and acts the way she does. I didn't much care for her one-night stand despite having a 'beau' back in DC. I wouldn't like that in a man; I certainly didn't in a woman. Some of the dialogue was a bit stilted, but that's to be expected for a first book in a series; the characters will fill out and appear more natural in subsequent sequels (I hope). Good twist at the end, though - keep that up."
2,This Author Must Have Never Set Foot in Texas,"I am not going to refute every ignorant misstatement regarding Texas. Sufice it to say if you are from Texas you probably won't be able to get past the ridiculous and inaccurate descriptions of everything relating to Texas, from the weather to the travel arrangements. As we say in Texas, this is a mess ""Bigger than Dallas."""
4,Good Read,I really enjoyed reading this book. This was my first time reading any book in this series and now that I have I intend to read the rest of the series.
3,My Review,I was so excited when this book arrived ahead of the schedule. My excitement didn't last when I found out it was the first two novels of the series which I obviously didn't realize. I already have those books. I thought this was a book with Savich alone. My bad!
4,Can't Beat Two for One,"I've read some of her later books, but wanted to read the beginnings of the characters. The 2nd book is written better than the first, but I enjoyed both. Looking forward to reading more!"
4,Intriguing read,"Intriguing read, keeps you guessing all along. Would have given it 5 stars if some of the romantic aspects of the 2 lead character wasn't so rushed. No one acts all closed off and uninterested in having a serious relationship to jumping into bed and planning to get married...otherwise the car and mouse game was great..."
3,Ron from Tarzana,"Jesse Winchester is a great artist, and for his part, this is a great album. Unfortunately, the company reissuing this and other Winchester albums, Wounded Bird Records, did a horrible job of remastering it. The sound is much too bassy and flat, with virtually no high end at all. It needs to be run through an equalizer to listen to it. The CD deserves 5 stars for Winchester's part, and 1 for Wounded Bird's part, which is why I gave it only 3. I've emailed Jesse about this problem and he responded with: ""I'm afraid I have no control and no influence over the companies who release those records. I was not consulted or even informed by Wounded Bird. I haven't the money for a law suit....I'm very sorry about this. I wish there were something concrete I could do, but due to my own naivite as a young man and the unscruplous people I was doing business with, I have no artistic or financial control whatever over those recordings. We live and learn."""
1,Keep Your Money & Find a Really Good Tutor Instead!,"If you got an ""A"" in all of your Calc. classes, you won't need this book. If you got ""B""s or ""C""s, and are looking for guidance from this solutions manual, you will get very little. This book skips to every 3rd problem (i.e. 3, 6, 9, 12, etc.) and barely explains the steps. It gives the solution, and maybe 1 or 2 steps along the way. That's it. This book is very thin, only about 125 pages, and was the most expensive of all the solutions manuals I've bought before. This book needs to be redone to mirror other solutions manuals, which give nearly complete solutions to ALL ODD NUMBER PROBLEMS. In my opinion, don't waste your money on this book, instead, make sure you have an excellent professor, or find a really good tutor."
2,Shooting script,Contained camera instructions that Goldman did not write. Only had brief comments by Goldman. Almost no explanation of why the reader or audience would care about the main characters.
5,Great Emerging Market Lessons,"I have worked extensively in Russia, rather than China, but most of the author's experiences and lessons are just as applicable to Russia or any other emerging market.Other than describing some common pitfalls and challenges, the author does a great job of explaining with insight, humor, and feeling why people are attracted to invest and live in emerging markets.A good, fun, quick, read that might actually teach you something. Highly recommended!TMR"
4,long ago and far away,"I had one of these years ago, and it was one of my favorites. The retractable point had a bit of a flimsy feel to it, though it never broke. In fact I used this pencil for about five years until it finally was lost. The price now seems too high."
5,Excellent Soundtrack,This encouraging CD uplifts my spirit every time I listen to it. It is also a great gift for friends who love the movie as well.
5,"Incredible vocals, lyrics, and score",The music throughout the entire soundtrack is powerful. You can't help but be enchanted as the music overpowers you and you are swept away. The score is remarkable and the vocals are beautiful. Who knew Michelle Pfeiffer had such a voice! Enough can't be said about this title.
5,"Brillent movie, brillent music-except the pop-singer parts.","I bought the soundtrack right after I saw the movie. Music is the part of the success of this movie. So powerful. The down part is the pop singers. They don't fit into the soundtrack at all. They just put them in to boost sales. The Mariah Carey and Whitney version of ""When you believe"" is distracting. My favorite song is the Pfeiffer and Dworshky version(Track 14). The voice is so pure yet powerful. This track alone is enough for the money I paid. I don't see any point of puting pop singers into the soundtrack. They are not doing anything, only distracting. Their contemporary sound fits oddly within this exotic atmosphere."
3,Good Marie Antoinette biography,I have read a number of biographies and histories of Marie Antionette as well as several histories on the Louies. This biography reads well and is interesting. I recommend it.
5,Useful for younger boys,"I've coached my son's team for three years as a dedicated parent, but my b-ball drills have been re-treads of my old Jr. & Sr. High drills. I looked for a book for awhile before finding this one; it has given me many fun & challenging drills easy enough for 9 - 11 year old boys with variations that expand as their skill level increases. I'd think that this book would be adequate at least through Middle School age. Perhaps the only caution is that this book assumes that the reader--if not the players--knows the game well. In other words, it is not a book to teach the coach the game."
1,Dead film (literally),"First of all its not one that shown on picture. Its white boxed PanF.Secondly - all four rolls were stone dead. As in - clear film. Meaning that they were stored improperly - overfrozen or overheated, so emultion lost its ability to respond to light. Considering that at the same time , using same chemicals i got through at least 10 rolls of Kodak TMAX and Fuji ACROS, i'd say its a pretty safe bet, that culpit was in fact that film. Which is pity - Ilford was always my preferred choice in B&W.; So while film is good.. getting it like that and here - might be issue."
3,Epoch,"Have enjoyed science fiction all my life. This story was different from anything I'd read or seen, and enjoyed it and the characters. Was also pleased when they made a sequal, and purchased it, too."
4,How to Work on the Present and the Future at the Same Time,"This is Ken Blanchard's idea of how to propel your company securely into the future by dividing up your talent pool into two self-chosen groups - the P(resent) Team and the F(uture) Team. Aside from their regularly assigned positions, employees would commit themselves to one of these teams based on their own personal preference. Ken says you have adminstrators and producers that gravitate toward the P team and innovators and integrators that belong on the F team. These teams are overseen by a balanced Steering Committee that adopts the best of both teams. A patchwork of recycled ideas.Interesting but non-riveting.Four Stars"
2,Disppointing,"I should have come to this site and read the reviews before purchasing the book. It was very disappointing. The chapter headings were interesting, and some were good insights. However, the author spent too much time around elaborating too many of the sub-points. There were also little case studies. Felt like the book could be condensed a lot more."
4,good cd,"while this cd is good.. it feels very repetetive. after i listen to anthem (track 1) i find it hard to listen to anymore.. while each song is good.. it just feels like its the same song over and over again just with different lyrics. Tom has improved this slightly on Failure.. in which there was a couple stand out tracks. While he has incredible music making abilities... he needs to make his vocals lifting a little.. he sounds like a robot and i'm not even sure if you could call his vocals singing.. more like talking. anyways, a good EBM never-the-less"
5,Easily A23's Best,"After all these years, this is the A23 CD I keep revisiting. The structure is fairly minimal, the vocals are ever-so-slightly distorted and gritty, and the lyrics alternate between metaphor and blatant anger seamlessly. Overall, there are few albums that can match the sort of raw power and aggression contained in this little gem, and unfortunately Tom Shear kinda took the whole A23 enterprise steadily downhill from here. If you're a big fan of his newer work, i.e. Meta or Storm, then you probably won't like this -- there are no grandiose, sweeping synths, no upbeat lyrics to speak of (unless you count the manic half of Bi-Polar, whose happiness is purely disingenuous), no melodies that would sound like they belong in any club these days. Contempt is too strong for many people, but it's clear that this is where Shear's best work lies."
5,"Thorough, indepth indispensable piece of work",I bought the book in Feb 2003 to assist me on a project. It is an essential book for any level APO consultant. The book contains sections to understand how APO functions and also how to apply it - down to detailed technical level. The book is essential as SAP's own courses and documentation is vastly inadequate to equip someone to consult in supply chain theory and implementation. Detailed diagrams and tables explain complex concepts clearly.Pierre Fouriepsfourie@yahoo.co.uk
3,Mizuno compression shorts,"Not quite as tight as the all spandex compression shorts, these are best for baseball (cup holder is a plus), but less good for football and other sports that benefit from super-tight compression that spandex provides."
4,great compression shorts,"great compression shorts, order them all the time. i like the cotton mix better than the others. mostly use them for running and working out. will keep using them until i can't find them on the web anymore."
2,Coffee table jungle.,"Groove is an incredible DJ with an ear to the future, but this album is incredibly disappointing. Even with Optical as engineer, this album fails to deliver as promised. Not as innovating as Plug, not as techy as Ed Rush/Optical project Virus, not as funky as anything Miles did in the 70's. But, if you liked New Forms, this may be for you."
2,"Decent, but I wasn't too impressed","In this CD, i feel that Grooverider has forgotten that drum and base music is supposed to be entertaining, as well as meaningful. No doubt, Grooverider is one of the best at what he does, but the majority of this CD, with the exception of ""Where's Jack the Ripper"" and ""560 Degrees"", is just too boring. Nice try Grooverider, but you missed the mark on this one"
3,"good, yet incomplete","In the Lake of the Woods is a very well written classic. It does manage to keep your interest alive and your fingers turning the pages; however, after reading the book, one is left with an incomplete feeling becuase the author leaves the reader no actual ending. The reader is left up to decide in his/her own head what happened. For me, reading a book is a process you go through. The author gives you some background information, sets up his climax, and then ends it with a bang. If one step of the process is cut short or completely left out, the book feels empty. Although O'Brien did an excellent job writing the book, after the time I put into reading it, i wish he would have just gone ahead and ended it for me."
4,I found the book extreamly intreaging,"I thought that ""In the lake of the woods"" was a wonderful book. It's post modern structure is wonderful, making reading the book a interesting experiance, while also adding a great sense of reader interactivity to the story. I am impressed with Tim O'Brian's efforts in ""In the lake of the woods"", he combines a wonderful combination of fact and fiction in creating a brilliant piece of work."
1,Comments on using the book as a Yr 12 VCE novel,"I am currently studying year 12 and we have just read the novel In The Lake of The Woods. As part of our work requirements, we are required to read this novel and do a reprt on specific features in the novel. I feel as a book itself it was a an awful novel. The book constantly jumps back and forwards, making it extemly difficult for the reader to understand the plot. I had to read the book three times before i even understood what was happening, and then i had to reaqd it another 2 times after that, so that i could make notes on the novel. Although i liked the way the book didn't have a ending, rather just a number of hypotthesis, I feel that book was rubbish and when i have finished writing my reprt i will be throwing the book out."
3,In the Lake of the Woods book reveiw,"When I was reading this book I was really confused. The main charactor was very weird and very depressing. The things that he had to deal with in war must have been hard, but the way he followed his girlfriend around was really weird. I don't know how the auther could have thought of a book like this. It is confusing and I wouldn't read it again. The way they kept going back and forth from thing to thing was real hard to follow."
2,I'm Proud To Be An American,"I am probably missing something, but this dark story about the ills of America's political system, the freedom loving people of North Vietnam, and their horrendous slaughter at the hands of Charlie Company didn't work for me. Nam was a tragedy, a horrible mistake. But this story is not entertaining (it is painful), contains more of the same old ""aren't we Americans horrible"" media line, and had nothing fresh or revealing. The characterization of John and a unique style of inserting quotes into the novel were well done. I found little else to like in this gloomy little narrative. Not recommended"
1,Horrible,"This tea is pretty horrid. It is finely ground, almost to the size of instant coffee grounds. Most filters will let this ""loose tea"" fall right through. Its flavor tastes like dirt, and I believe it made me dizzy and nauseous. I'd describe the flavor as a very low quality bagged tea. The tin is not even air tight, so if you're going to be bold after reading this review and still order it, at least get it in the bag. I would not ever purchase this tea again.I also boughtLicorice Root Tea 4 oz tin of loose teafrom the same company, and that actually tastes alright. It has a very pleasant sweet flavor, with a very very mild hint of wood shavings. Although the tin is still as described above."
2,"Fun, interesting pop ups but buttons are not working properly","I gave an overall of 2 stars only because the buttons are not working well. The red and the blue buttons are okay. The orange button supposes to pop up when you press it to one side, but it feel like it will pop up once you slightly touch it. The yellow button would not twist back to its original position. Therefore, you need to turn the yellow button back to the original position again before it pops up again. I suspect that this is a manufacture problem. Other than this, it's very fun. The pop up moves in a very fun and interesting way (instead of sitting still there). However, I would not recommend this product."
1,Bad warranty arrangement,"This may be a good product but if you ever have probelm with it the AKAI corp will not fix it for you. It seems they do not stand by their product. I have a warrenty claim in with them since March 06, and they do not even answer their phone."
1,"Problems after owning it 1 year, 1 month and 13 days later","I loved my Akai 4250 until tonight. It died!!! Silly me didn't buy the warranty with the TV when I bought it because Akai is supposed to be a good company. I did my research before plunking down my hard earned money. Got a good deal on the TV...or so I thought. I have purchased other TV's before and never had problems with them, so I am thinking...why spend the money on a warranty for my projection TV. Bad move...$799 down the drain! Sounds like they don't stand behind their product per a previous post. Akai won't be brand that I consider again."
5,Perfect good luck charm,"The weight, size and look of this charm is just right. It is the perfect good luck charm, so pretty."
2,Vamp..,Oh this movies is trash. I bought it and never seen it until it arrived. Wow this movie is so bad. Grace Jones as a stripper vampire.enough said
4,The Amazing Grace,"This is one of those corny, but charming, horror movies from the 1980s. It falls into the same category as Fright Night. But there is one element in this movie that sets it apart and makes it truly worth watching: Grace Jones. She gives a totally erotic performance as a female modern-day vampire. Gedde Watanaber also gave a very funny performance as a rich Asian-American college student named Duncan. Chris Makepeace and Robert Rusler were the stars, however, Gedde Watanabe and Grace Jones basically stole every scene that they were on. It's worth your time to watch this movie."
2,Almost as boring as Robinson Crusoe,"This book was really boring. It had basically the same idea as Defoe's Robinson Crusoe, and the title, ""FOE,"" came from Daniel DeFOE. I didn't really like Robinson Crusoe, and I thought that this book was just too much like it. It was boring, and not very fun to read. If you've already read Robinson Crusoe, don't bother reading this; there are a few differences, but it's mostly the same stuff."
4,A Whole Lot Of Goodness,"This small book is packed with a whole lot of goodness. It has been inspired by one who is just filled with all its goodness and love that this book has to offer. You'll be delighted to find the recipes to be a whole lot different from the host of cook books on the market. It helps to set a purpose as to why you may want to cook that next meal. So when you set yourself to that special meal, pick up a copy of ""O'Taste and See"" and get started on that purpose."
1,"If you buy and read this, it's your ""inheritance of loss"" !","Unable to believe this won a Booker prize! What's with the committee? What kind of a message is it driving to readers by endorsing such a pathetic book by endowing it a prestigious award? By the time you finish you will be/have:(1) ""Drained and depressed"", by the grim and dismal world created by Desai(2) ""Confused and irritated"", with the heavy linguistic pretense(3) ""Mentally flagellated"", by the unbearable constant negativity of the characters(4) Lost either your ""money"" or ""time"" or both.(5) Regretting your ""inheritance of loss""!What more can I say, the title says it all and justifies it all."
1,Dont waste your time or money,"Terrible and pretentious writing. I tried to read this book without much luck. If you have trouble sleeping, this is the perfect sleeping pill."
1,so disappointed!,"It's very rare for me to put a book down, but with this one, I just had to. Unreadable, I couldn't make myself care about the characters. Bad prose, definitely: choppy, disharmonious and self-conscious.So much for the Booker win..."
3,poor editing,"There are so many beautiful sentences here from the first page; but then so many that are off; and then what seemed like extremely poor editing. Look at the second page description of the mist rolling in, that exquisite literary conceit is compromised by what has to be the unintentional use of the words thick and thickened all over that page...this kind of sloppy editing, lazy eye, and ear, on the part of the author and her editors just boggles the mind."
3,A mixed bag for me,"This story holds clear moments of brilliance, no doubt, but I found a strange lack of focus within the pages that was unsettling. I also felt there were far too many characters. The depiction of humiliation was excellently wrought, as was India's caste system and political upheavals. However, when Biju's life extends to New York city, I felt the author lost her grasp on the importance of his character development.Though the writing was at times lush, there was no clear ""movement"" forward from one scene to the next, and the story itself lacked the focus to hold my attention in the way it should have."
1,Don't waste your time,"This won the Booker? Never mind the incoherent plot and the overwrought, kitschy, and syntactically challenged prose; the nasty taste in the mouth occasioned by the contempt in which Desai evidently holds every single character in the novel alone should have disqualified this from the running. Every character, major and minor, is shown to be unintelligent, unreflective, selfish, and preposterous. Desai's world is populated by people who show neither self-awareness nor empathy, and so exact none in the reader. But I suppose the Rushdie-esque burblings along with the exoticized cast and locale make for a bestseller."
3,well written but ultimately aimless,"The writing is lush, evocative. At first I was draw into the story and the characters but a lack of something--perhaps a sufficient narrative--I lost interest and could not finish the book"
2,Winners are losers for me,"A friend gave me a most interesting book review magazine for the holidays and one of the most covered books was"" The Inheritance of Loss. ""I noted it had won the Booker award and the description was appealing to me.Alas, I found the book tedius and not at all what I expected. I've travelled extensively and have lived on several continents. I recognize the author's intent , I think, to introduce the reader not only to the description of Tibet/India, but to the character of that part of the world; a world we do not know; a world so changed and so rapidly changing; a world of traditions and customs, class and behavior.For me, this failed miserably and I felt as if the author was using a superb vocabulary in a vacume. Perhaps, not finishing it did an injustice to the content but James Joyce she is not. I think I will keep away from Booker award winners and stick with just good writing."
3,A Meanspirited story,"I love novels set in the Himalayas so when I read about Kiran Desai's novel I was keen to read it. I will grant that she is the master of detail, and her characters are solid, but her narrative perspective is not as the jacket read ""lit by moral intelligence."" In fact, I found this novel to be the contrary. Ms. Desai's stuck in one gear: bitterness. There are no redeeming or even likable characters in this novel. Everyone is petty and shallow, and the narrator seems to sit over everyone with a condescending bitterness that I found hard to swallow. I put it down several times and only finished it because I kept hoping it would get better. I talked to anyone I know who read this book and they all felt the same way. She needs to get off her moral high horse and really see people for the complex beings they are. I was so dissapointed. I give it a 3 rather than a 2 only because I do think her technical craft is good."
2,Loss of Direction,"The story starts off pretty well but halfway through I found myself skipping paragraphs for there was no story to be read. It just goes on and on and then it ends.The novel is full of racial stereotyping - so much of it that after the first few chapters I didn't find it funny anymore. Given that the author herself divides time between India and US, this cultural confusion is what has crept into her writing too, maybe.How did this manage to pull-off a Booker?"
1,"Run, do not walk, away from this book.","I cannot believe this won a prize. I grabbed it off of the library shelf and the synopsis, along with the fact that it had won a prize, convinced me to read it. I will not fall for the Man Booker Prize emblem again. The story is absolutely depressing. Not one thing nice happens to any of the characters. Some people may claim that life is exactly as the book portrays it, however, I have a feeling they are far and few between because the majority of them would have long since committed suicide. Worst of all, there is no real end to this book. None of the characters find resolution or enlightenment. ""What is my life? It's nothing. Better that it's gone. It's useless to everyone, useless to you and me. Kill me..."" Oh yes, just shoot me now, please!The best part of this book was the lovely cover."
3,Indian sexuality and society,"There is an image of The Indian Judge of a Briish empire having the sex for the first time witn his young wife, which becomes a rape, leaving behind the judge with a life-long appalling memory of the smell of excreta from his wife - apart from other violent images.: Sex mostly happens like this in Indian marriages for the first time. Man are advised by elders to behave in a civilised way with their young brides. But marriages do survive more often.There are equally powerful moments in the book that convey the essence of the people and their circumstances.Author of Delhi-return"
3,Decent club song,"I don't know really, making a cover of another dance song? also a song that was released just a year before. Is she out of inspiration or something, maybe. Dannii is good but far from her sisters limits, however i do like the song. Dannii is doing it well, a club hit atleast."
1,Not the best,I ordered these to put on our family car. We consistently warp the rotors. When the rotors arrived they were much lighter than OEM. I put them on a scale. Each rotor was 2.37 lbs. lighter than stock. I sent them back.
2,Great Instrumentation......Totally ruined by Ozzy,"The first real live album from the original four members .....Tony, Geezer and Bill really lay it down heavy, sounding as tight as ever... WAR PIGS, the opener, is terrific and spine-tingling until Ozzy opens his mouth.....""F""-bomb after ""F""-bomb, seems like every 4th measure, Ozzy shows how light-weight and totally vacuous this guy's head is....Believe me, folks , he was not like this in the 70's....Where for aught thou, friend Ozzy???I was really looking forward to this release, originally, but one listen and it went on Ebay......I have heard that there was going to be a cleaned up version because of all the complaints the label execs received...But I've yet to hear anymore about this. Be warned...Profanity galore, and way off key vocals completely ruin this noble effort from 3 of the 4 members."
2,Ok for only 2 new songs,"First of all your better off just buying all their cd's, cause there are good songs that aren't on this cd, second of all, The vocals on this cd aren't that great, Although the two new songs rock, they just don't make up for the high price, and there are just too many live albums out there with these songs on them. So find a friend who has this cd and barrow it first."
3,Great Music- Mediocre Singer,"I got this cd for the music only. I had read the reviews about Ozzy using the F word with every breath and it's all true. I could really do without that. It's pointless.The music is great. You get an opportunity to hear all the classics with updated equipment and production. Sounds great. Much better than the Live Evil cd.BUT, again, we have Ozzy being himself, which is a shame. Why on earth couldn't it have been an Ian Gillan reunion??? Or Dio?If you want to hear some great new versions of your favorite classics then buy this cd. If hearing Ozzy say the F word 15 times in between each song is going to bother you then you might want to just leave this one alone."
2,A very disappointing album.,"I was looking forward to a Black Sabbath reunion and hearing the guys do those old songs again. Growing up and listening to Paranoid and other Sabbath albums really got me excited when this came out. Boy what a shame it had to be this bad. Ozzy yelling the F word every time Iommi goes into a guitar solo is a little too much. The songs and the concert would have been much better if this had not been done. As for the new songs, well they don't even come close to matching the fire that Iron Man, Sabbath Bloody Sabbath and Snowblind have. The only reason I didn't rate this any lower is out of respect to the band. I think they may need to think about hanging it up once and for all."
2,I have to agree with the last review..This STINKS!,OZZY with his constant garbage dialogue throughout the set ruins it for the listener. If the music was played the way they used to...he wouldn't need to try so hard to get audience participation. Just another low point in Ozzy's career. With all the swearing and everything...Ozzy sound like a total loser!Save your money. Skip this one.
5,good listening for little ears!,"And big ears, too! We really enjoy the Christian themes and music. Not like alot of other ""Christian"" music, which has a rock/rap type background. My 5-year old daughter, when we were listening to it for the first time, asked, ""Are we obeying God?"", when the song, ""How can I glorify God"" came on! They do understand and listen to the words!"
2,"Attractive, but Pitted","This shave set is attractive, with a nice weight to it. However, the brass is pitted in places, particularly around the edge of the bowl (perhaps because it was shipped from overseas). In addition, the bristles are stiff. I do not recommend this product."
1,Product does not work,Product does not work and I do not recommend for anyone else. I opened the product and did everything it said to do. Went to use it and nothing. I would have returned it but it would cost me more in the long run to return this product then to keep it and give it to good will.
2,Poor Sound,The sound on this Captain from Castile DVD was not what I had heard in the theatre! Instead off the rich surround sound it was dull and muted. Very disappointing!
4,Christmas gift,Gift for my Sister in law for Christmas from her wish list so perfect for family viewing and just what she wanted
5,Power Movies,This collection of Tyrone Power's great movies. I love old moviesand these won't disappoint anyone!
5,Solid new singer makes geat new cd!!,"So sad to see Lance King go but new singer makes up for it.This is the heavist of the BOP cd's,more progressive and surprisingly good.Recomended!!!"
3,Interesting at first.....,"I purchased this for $3.99 in one of those second-tier book stores at one of the outlet malls. The cover & its description were interesting enough but towards the end, I was glad I didn't pay full price. I could relate to many of ""Mom's"" messages but found my mind wandering as I struggled to finish the last twenty or so pages. Perhaps some of the reviewers are correct: The CD may be funnier."
2,I need to get the CD...,I thought this book was just OK. It really wasn't the 'laugh-out-loud' book I was expecting. I definitely think the CD would be a million times better. I just didn't think her little comments after each message were very funny. Maybe for a stand-up act...but not when your reading it. I think Amy's Answering Machine is something that needs to be heard...not read.
5,Great Brazilian Music !!!!!!!,"Just love all the songs on this CD, the songs make you feel like you are always on vacation, so relaxing to the mind, body and soul. Thanks again Amazon!. I would surely recommend this to anyone who appreciate relaxing music."
5,This little tote goes with me everywhere!,"I LOVE LOVE LOVE these little tote bags. In fact, I love them so much I bought a whole bunch of them to give to my Mom, sisters, and girlfriends. When folded into its attached storage pouch (which becomes the front pocket when unzipped) it's so small it easily fits in my purse, and quickly unzips to become a pretty big shopping tote. This is a great way to avoid getting plastic bags, which I hate! I have bigger reusable bags for groceries, but this little bag is great to have on hand for spur-of-the-moment purchases. Highly recommended!"
3,Great but handle on one bag ripped...twice!,"These small bags are great!You can put a lot in them and they are very portable too and wash well.Now my problem is one of my bags, the handle has ripped twice!once it was in one area and i sewed that up, then a few weeks later another part of the handle breaks.I have not had this bag extremely long and the one in black I bought before 1.5 years ago is still fine, it is the most recent one that ripped.I use these a lot to carry packages of 12 water bottles on the bus and also heavy vegetables and no issues with my other bags!the only thing that could improve is if there was a totebag that had a zipper all along the top so small things do not slip out!"
4,Pleasant read.,"I enjoyed reading this book for its authentic background. We will never be able to learn the whole truth as to what may have occurred during the tragic ordeal of those who were present, but Roberts tells a wonderful story anyhow. It's all history now."
5,Great program and performance,"First of all the program is perfect. Starting with Dvorak's a lovely little piece, the inspiring contemporary piece, followed by the well-known Franck piece for cello/piano and finished with Shostakovich 9.Performance is perfect too. Lucerne Symphony Orchestra conducted by Neeme Jarvi is so vivid and energetic. Argerich and Maisky know the music even with the world premiere contemporary piece. They were very well prepared.I wished to be there that night, but this fabulous Bluray recording makes me feel almost I were."
2,Written in 1990,"This book, somewhat wordy, was written in 1990. There have been advances in technology in the past 13 years. There's no mention in his book on LASER devices or Ka band radar. Easy reading, yet not current. Look for another book."
3,Good Book,"This book is good but does not help you fight a speeding ticket if you get one. It does help you avoid the chances of NOT getting stopped. If you do get a ticket tho, the book I would recommend is An Educated Guide to Speeding Tickets, How To Beat and Avoid Them by Richard Wallace. You can buy it here on Amazon. The book works, I used it and beat a ticket. Good luck to youall!!"
1,Don't waste your time,"Very poorly written book with very poor advice. Things like -- show some clevage, cry a lot, etc."
4,The solution should not be printed below the diagram.,"For Sam Lyod, the chess puzzle king, there is no need to comment. But one thing annoys me is that the solution is printed under each puzzle diagram,so one either set up the problems using a chess sets, or have to cover the solution hoping not to see the answers unintentionally. This would make the reader very inconvient!!I don't understand how such obvious thing the publihser should miss!!"
3,Cheap,These are poorly made. The straps won't stay at the length I set them. But for the price I couldn't argue.
3,Works but moves around too much,"Nice and soft, I use these when working on the car in the garage. Saves the knees but the straps losen up and then the pads fall down my legs and/or twist around my leg. Can't figure out how to keep the straps from losening."
5,Great for photography (:,"I shoot a lot of bugs in nature, and most of the time i'm on my knees, I searched for knee pads that will be comfortable, but will also fit high pressure on mixed soil like dirt and rocks.. this one is very soft from inside, but the hard shell in front does an excellent job.besides that they go on and off very quickly with a hook to connect them around your knees, and you can fit the strap to your own size..AimishBoy.com"
3,Didn't get to use this...,"Even though I bought this when planning a trip to greece, I did not travel to the islands as originally panned and decided to stay in the mainland for 2 weeks. So its difficult for me to review this product without first hand experience ..."
2,Tiny clamp,"To give you an idea of the size: Base is one inch square, width inside U bar is 5/8 inch, draw is inch, thread is 3mm metric. It was too small to hold the door shut for which it was ordered."
5,5 star plus,"Every book of Watchman Nee's, I am very impressed with. But this book shed so much light that I can no longer be dependent on myself but on God. This in turn will cause us to trust in God, and love Him to the uttermost! I am extremely happy that I am a believer!"
5,FUN BOOK -- the Post-Mafia dream --,"I liked this book a lot. If you're a big goodfellas buff, and most people are, you're in for some entertainment here. Plenty of good anecdotes about the gangsters, their wives, their kids, Gotti -- the whole nine yards.The thing to keep in mind is that it's written by Henry Hill -- a guy who has no real formal training in grammar (it's explained early on in the book). If you've heard him on Howard Stern, then you know he never really answers the question you ask him, and that voice comes through here.His life has been a wild ride to read about."
3,"Good book, No Real New Info, Poorly Written","I wouldn't go to the lengths to say this book was horrible, that's if you can get past all the poor grammar. However, I feel like I'm reading the book as Hill talks. If you have watched the movie Goodfellas then no need to buy this book for information. To me it seemed like it summarized the movie with a few unknown facts thrown in. I did find the book entertaining though. Henry draws out his life in the Witness Protection Program, basically all he does is drugs and cheats on his wife. No new info there! This would be a book I'd borrow from a friend not buy. I wasn't disappointed by the book, but I was hoping for some more insight."
3,"Bad for teaching, Ideal for reference","I used this book as the primary text in my Basic Linear Algebra class. The information is presented in a manner that is overly dense for instruction, and the problems are, at best, mediocre. Fortunately for us, the instructor wrote his own problems for our practice.Later, I needed to give a friend a crash course in linear algebra for a philosophy of science course he was starting. I used this book as a reference for my tutoring, and it was ideal. The chapter layout and examples are perfect for use as a reference by one who is already familiar with the material. I let my friend borrow this book for the semester and he has repeated my opinion, that it makes an ideal reference book.A five star book would have a reasonable balance of reference and teaching, this one fails in teaching and makes for an excellent reference, so I am giving a rating of three stars."
3,"Somewhat awkwardly written, but insightful nonetheless","The book is particularly useful on India in the first millenium AD, though Ms. Thapar's prose occasionally feels stilted. Overall a worthwhile read, though hardly her most important work: for that check out From Lineage to State (reprinted in Cultural Pasts, March 2000."
1,Completely outrageous and informationless,"I expected a more out or a historian like Romila Thapar. The whole book looks like biased Indian culture bashing boring read. The information sources and references seem like they have been picked specially for a pool of India hating English historians library. The real essence of Indian culture which has bought into this world Vedas, Yoga and beautiful art forms seems to be completely missing. Definitely not a read for a person getting introduced to Indian culture (Wrong Views), informationless for a knowledge seeker (Colorless Views)."
4,PEE-YOUR-PANTS FUNNY!,"This hysterically funny ""autobiography"" of drive-in movie critic Briggs is one of the best humor novels ever written. Taking a well-deserved swipe at over-hyped celebrity books, Briggs goes through life with a bemused grin on his face and not too many thoughts in his head. His recounting of how he invented the first topless bar in America is a scream, and his life as a Country/Western star is a hoot, too. Don't miss this one, even if you aren't familiar with Joe Bob's drive-in movie columns. Also, it actually predates many overinflated celeb autobios, like SEINLANGUAGE, PRIVATE PARTS, and ENTER WHINING."
4,Fine replacement for 50-200mm SWD case,"I purchased myOlympus Zuiko 50-200mm f/2.8-3.5 SWDsecond hand and it was missing both the hood and the case. When I saw this case go on sale I purchased it, as this is an expensive lens and it's nice to have some protection when storing it (or transporting it outside of my bag).The case is of sturdy construction, befitting a lens of the 50-200 SWD's class. Soft but semi-rigid, and fairly well padded. A shoulder strap is provided. The case closes by dual zipper and velcro, in addition to a flap which clips closed. It fits my 50-200mm SWD well, including reversed hood and tripod collar."
5,Simply the best...,"I have been listening to these two discs for several years now. I am a huge acoustic guitar fan, which goes along with being a fan of Dave Matthews Band, Jack Johnson, Ben Harper, etc. These two discs are a key piece of any acoustic guitar fan's music collection. I have listened to Live at Luther College so much that I had to buy the discs again. Great for long road trips, mellow get togethers, the bedroom? Ah yeah. If you don't have this music... put simply... buy them right away. Highlights? Dancing Nancies, Warehouse, and Tim's Solo (Stream). Enjoy"
5,Pretty fly for a live album.,"I think it's better than his real albums because it has songs not previsously recorded. If you enjoy Dave Matthews, and even if you don't, you will like this cd."
3,Luther College Review,"I think that this cd contains many good songs although they are missing the effect that they have on you when Dave has the whole band playing with him, Even though Dave Matthews is a good guitar player. The songs were good, but the lack of drums, saxaphones, and the other brass instruments make it an unplugged collection that just can't compare to Listener Supported"
2,annoying,"I just can't understand why people think Dave Mathews is so amazing. In truth, his band is quite talented, but his voice could be topped by anyone. The nasal screeching lyrics make me want to puke. Try listening to real music with people who can actually sing. Lay off the bong for a while and listen to someone talented. Possibly with a voice....."
2,Stick to the studio recordings!!!,"...unless of course you are a hard core dm fan. This album is basically the cd's with the band removed. DM's guitar work and vocal work don't really shine like I had expected them to. I just think that hsince he knew this was going to be an album, he could have rearranged the songs to make them a little more interesting and intimate for his fans, as is fitting for solo acoustic guitar. But these acoustic recordings really add nothing to the songs, they don't let you feel them in a different way. Plus, for some reason, the way the acoustic guitar was recorded made it sound really bad."
1,Dave Mathews,"Dave Mathews use to be my favorite group but now they've lost thier musical flare. Lyrically, they are one of the most pathetic groups. I can only give this cd 1 star. Satilate is one of the worst songs I have ever heardTheir #1 fan Jon Kriewall Seattle, Wa"
5,Incredible,"This is probably the best album I have ever heard. As a hardcore DMB fan, I urge everyone to buy this album. With all the great songs and Tim's breath-taking guitar solos, this album could not be better. The CD is perfect for every part of your everyday lives, you can work to it, relax to it, sleep to it, walk to it, anything. I am telling you, BUY THIS ALBUM!, though I cant imagine anyone not owning it."
5,A new and wonderful side of Dave Matthews,The best live recordings of Dave's music I have ever heard. The album also represents a more humors and entertaining Dave compared to the more serious Dave we are used to seeing.
5,"Comments from the authors, Benedict & Nancy Freedman","We are the authors of MRS MIKE, listed in Amazon.com in several editions, hardcover and paperback. We are delighted by the online reviews you received and by your efforts to find a new audience for the book. One correction: we are co-authors; please credit us as Benedict & Nancy Freedman, not ""et al,"" or ""contributor."" Thank you. Sincerely, Benedict & Nancy Freedman"
5,Want to buy at least 5 copies to give away,"Truly a great read. I read it in junior high school, and just bought it and re-read it. Women like her do not exist today. Too much whining over the appearances and amentities. Whatever she was presented with she would just suck it up, and work shoulder to shoulder with her husband and neighbors to overcome whatever the problem was. Impossible to put this book down."
4,Condition issues,"I love and will always love Mrs.Mike... that's why I bought it.When my order came, I was really upset because there were black sharpie marks across the cover.It's still the same book and I love it, but this made me understandably sad."
5,A Movie Based on this story would be WONDERFUL!!!,"I read this book in one day. I couldn't stop. I love the fact that it took place back in the early 1900's. Life was sometimes hard but also simple, slower. I would really like to see it made into a movie. It was a terrific story. The writers did a wonderful job. You could picture it in your mind, as if you were there."
4,Review on Thimar,I have heard Anouar Brahem first on the solo cd called Madar by Jan Garbarek. I liked the intimate oriental sound he makes on the instrument. This is the first and the only solo cd by Anouar Brahem that I have perchesed. I like it particularly because I can also appreciate on it deep base by Dave Holland and the excellent pellucid horns by John Surman. The trio sounds nice.
1,You get what you pay for,This is not a pratical cookbook holder. None of the cookbooks I have even fit in this thing. It looks nice for a decoration but do not waste your money if you plan on using this as a cookbook holder.
1,Amazon has mislabeled this item,"I ordered what I thought was the paperback version of the textbook, and what arrived was the student resource manual. If that is what you're after, great, but don't think that the paper back version is the textbook, it's not."
2,annoying,"I'm not too impressed with this. It had a Made in China sticker on the inside part which meant sticky glue got in my hair. This brand is supposed to be gentle on hair, so I didn't appreciate sticker glue gunk getting mixed in there. It felt pretty secure and the color was nice."
2,Missing pages and repete pages,Pages 1003 thru 1050 were missing in my copy.Pages 1051 thru 1098 were repeted.Check your copy carefully.The book would have been more helpful if all the pages indicated in the index existed.
5,A master work on Windows security,This is an amazing book. It's thorough and well researched. The writing is a bit dry but that's a minor quibble when it comes with the rest of this fine work. This is the best work I have seen on Windows 2003 security. Definitely worth a look and worth the money if this is your job.
4,nice,Nice book and somewhat relevant to today's issues. I did not purchase this item on Amazon. This is a review of the book not my purchasing experience obviously.
3,A bit too high-falutin,"This book, started out kind of exciting, with Scott going off to law school. Then it got boring and really kind of high falutin.(pretentious) He goes on a little too much about how Harvard is so special and the love of the law and all that. However, the final half of the book got good again when he got into the details of studying for exams and competition. So overall I give it 3 and 1/2 stars, it's just that amazon does not let you give a half.. It would be good for someone considering going to law school. Don't pay attention to all the people who reviewed it saying you should not read it until after first year. I would have appreciated reading this prior to my first year."
3,Expected more,"Turow in One L makes a valiant effort to convey the rigors, stresses, and challenges of a first year law student at the prestigious Harvard Law School. He attempts to do this by divulging some of his diary entries from his time as a ""One L."" Although informative, Turow could have brought this story together in a more coherent and plausible manner. The story jumps around quite frequently from one idea to another. However, do not let this inconsistency in Turow's writing dissuade you from reding ""One L."" He provides the novice and inquisitive with a perspective into the mythos of Harvard Law. Bravo Mr. Turow!"
5,Great for Prospects of Law School,"This book sheds a great light on the darkened world of Law School. It shows the good and bad from both a physical and emotional since. If you are thinking about Law School or just want to know what ""One L's"" go through this book will help. It is a must read for prospects of Law School."
2,Not so good,"Turow seems a bit, how shall I say, overwrought. Like when he messes up a meaningless, ungraded assignment and claims to feel ""corrosively ashamed."" And what's with him writing like some English wig-wearer, circa the twelfth century: ""I have finished my first term at the law."" Yeah, I hear you. The guy's popping Valium and getting all weepy whenever a teacher says a sharp word or two. Chill out, dude, it's only school. Harvard at that. You come to me and say ""Harvard"" and I figure you for a genius, not some nervous little priss. Why blow it by publishing your tear-stained diary?"
2,"not bad, as a novel","I suppose that for people who are way too tightly wound, law school might actually be like this. It wasn't for me. As other reviewers have pointed out, Turow must have never before been in an actual stressful situation before if he found law school this bad. In fact, it almost seems as if law school was the first time anyone had ever been mean to him at all.On the other hand, I didn't go to Harvard - I went to a school where no student had any chance of clerking for a Supreme Court justice or anything fancy like that. If people believe that their lives will be meaningless if they don't get to be on the Harvard Law Review, then maybe they do go to pieces when professors are mean to them.It's really not a bad book - it's entertaining and readable - but people should realize it's not a description of what most students experience in law school. And remember that it was originally published 30 years ago."
1,missing info,"after I purchased the book, I tried to download the free documents and they did not come up. I then called the home office and was told that the book was not relevant in the stat at I lived in. If there was some kind of disclaimer on your site ,i would have saved my money and tried something different"
5,The only one made in the USA! Model no longer offered....,"As expected, this compressor is top quality, made in the USA. Uses a 2hp Emerson motor, and Ingersoll Rand pump. Quiet, smooth, well built. Handles all the home mechanic's compressed air requirements for tools and any other compressed air needs.Sears now sells a replacement Garage Mate model (now made in Taiwan ?? WTF ? ) for $459 or so. Like everything else, manufacturing is being moved overseas. Roll the dice I guess. The new Garage Mate is still probably better than anything you're going to find at Harbor Freight. Make sure you get a compressor with a cast iron pump. The cheaper aluminum ones are noisy."
5,Great Book,"This is a must read for any professional developer. Even if you don't plan on practicing test-driven development, a thorough understanding of the idea is immensely useful."
4,Paul: His Story,"Purchased for a church program. Read previously and liked it, gave interesting insight into the man and his program. Will re-read for program."
4,interested but lucky & not in target group,A friend's therapist worked through with her & she wanted me to see the book. ADVISES DO NOT ATTEMPT TO WORK THROUGH THIS ISSUE WITHOUT HELP
2,Little belt pack,"The outer lens packs are much too small. My zoom lenses have too large of a diameter to use the lens cases. If I put my short portrait lens in the cases then I have to fish them out, since they only open on the top. As a result to make my system work I have to mount the big zoom on the camera, the 3 smaller lenses in the small outer lens tubes, flash and hoods in the center with the camera. If the pack had adjustible size lens tubes or even larger ones as options, I could make this work. I need to be able to strap around my waist. Terribly limited organization options. I think I will go spend time at a brick and morter store with my gear and send this one back. It just doesn't work for a small modern slr kit"
2,another mediocre affair from BH,"Why doesn't everyone finally admit that this guy just doesn't have IT. He tries real hard, quotes the right people, hangs out with all the right crowd, assembles a decent band, BUT - HE JUST DOESN'T HAVE THE TUNES. Still he wants you to take him seriously like he is an artist who matters. Forget It! I take him as seriously as Lenny Kravitz, who is another wannabe in a slightly different genre. Both are mediocre artists hiding behind some sort of relevance they feel they have achieved by doing their musical homework and writing some socially conscious tripe on occasion. THIS GUY IS A LOSER. DON'T BOTHER WITH ANY OF HIS STUFF. Anyone who has been around the block a time or two will acknowledge this. Strictly for kids or those with little musical knowledge or experience."
5,Don't worry about the horse being blind ...,"Just load up the wagon! This is a great double disc effort by Ben. Some songs harken back to albums past, yet it is still somehow fresh and great to listen to. I've been playing it all day at work and like it more and more with each time through."
2,Hit&Miss,"i'd give this album more of a 2&half. vocally he has never really moved me. always dug his lyrics&His guitar playing. this double set showcases his versatility which he has always had,but he doesn't quite have the voice to pull off the bigger task here at bridging the gap that he is still reaching for. Lenny Kravitz styling& success at being able to do certain things on a more commerical level have for the most part eluded Ben Harper,but I give Harper props for at least thinking outside of the box this time around."
1,A Dispiriting Din,"This album should be remembered as the place where ""post-rock"" finally crossed over into a dehumanizing, ""post-human"" realm. The genre is capable of so much more uplift and complexity: see Tortoise, earlier Trans Am, Mogwai, etc. It is a sonic transcription of the apocalypse, but not in a good way. I bought this at the time of the Columbine shootings and it felt like a nauseatingly appropriate soundtrack. This did not challenge my assumptions about the world; instead, it just made me feel mighty low.In terms of how it sounds, see what the guy from Georgia wrote below. He hit the nail on the head. There is no redemption on this record."
5,It gets to you...and will stay there forever.,"If there was ever a soundtrack that fits a movie perfectly (notwithstanding some of John Williams'work) this has to be it. How can I begin to explain the multitude of feelings in this Cd? Just play ""Stardust"", and you can see Tom Hanks' character standing on his porch watching the fireworks over the Seattle bay, remembering his wife. Listen to the lyrics and you'll understand what I mean: ""...the lonely nights, dreaming of a song; the nightingale, tells a fairytale, and I am once again with you..."" Just a sample of how the emotion reaches your soul and stays there. Everytime you listen to this CD you'll find yourself within the music, and falling in love again. Even the instrumental track is a touching, simple piece. All in all, an excellent selection of songs - ByeBye Blackbird, Stardust, When I fall in Love, they're all there for a reason. Listen and learn why."
4,call for a missing song,"I know the CD having it already... and it is very good. But there is a kind of deception: in the movie there is a wonderful edition of ""over the rainbow"" sung by Ray Charles, that it is not in this CD, and, moreover, it seems to be not available in any of the Ray Charles recordings. Please, if anybody know how to have this song, please let me know.Thank you Massimo"
4,"Where is ""Over the Rainbow""???","Awesome soundtrack but where is Ray Charles ""Over the Raibow??""""Why Hasn't anybody else asked for this besides me??4 out of 5 due to the song missing"
5,Nice Item,"Received item within two weeks. Somewhat slow with answering email inquiry, but did answer. Pleased with service and item."
2,Better than barbiturates,I bought this movie. Turned it on and began to watch. I woke up hours later. Some times I have trouble falling asleep. This movie would be just the ticket. It is a very effective somnoriffic. (Is that a word?)
2,Good concept; poor execution,The main character is portrayed by a singer/dancer. A supporting character is played by a contestant on America's Next Top Model. I think that with real actors this could have been much better. They bragged about filming with little digital cameras but it gives it the appearance of a film student's project. I wish I'd gotten this from the dollar machines instead of ordering through Amazon and spending more.
4,Different,This is a movie that makes you think about how precious time really is after you watch it you will think about time and also has great acting performances!
4,Movie in time,This is a very good movie if you like si/fi it is just a little slow in parts but over looking that it's a good see make a bowl of pop corn open a beer or whatever and sit down and watch what could be possible in the future!
4,Okay movie,It's not a great movie in my opinion. It was entertaining overall but the message seemed a little extreme. My girlfriend liked it so I got it for her.
2,"For Teens, Pre Teens, and Simple minded only","I got sucked in to this cartoon because I saw good ratings on another board and the story sounds intriguing. Little did I know the ratings must have been done by teenagers. If you're a thinking person or older forget this movie. There is no thinking logic, no semblance of this science fiction ever becoming remotely possible, and no reasoning in the movie concept."
1,"""In Time"" is absolutely the worst movie I've ever seen!","""In Time"" is absolutely the worst movie I've ever seen! Save yourself the t-he ""TIME"" and never watch this terribly written story!Oh and if for whatever reason you decide not to heed my warning, and a 1/4 of the way through the movie when you realize it's the stupidest and most ridiculous POS ever, but you wanna keep watching because maybe they'll start to possibly explain the movie or perhaps give you some background on this pathetic time technology... DON'T!!! This movie explains nothing. These people walk around with literally, their life savings on their arms! Which!! anyone can just grab and take at will. AHHHHH!!!!! are you kidding! The writer couldn't even come up with a sensible way to end the movie, just a 2 man army, about to rob the worlds biggest bank. What the....! I want my ""TIME"" back!!!"
1,It's friggin Robin Hood,title for review says it all. it's a friggin futuristic robin hood. complete waste of time. the puns of time were not worth my time and if i head another damn time joke within the movie I'm going to puke! this movie was flat and worthless (in time and money) so many plot holes it's disgusting ( too many to count).... rent this before you buy it!
5,Fast paced,"This was a very fast paced and entertaining movie. Justin Timberlake is very good as is Amanda Seyfreid. As crazy as the world is getting, I didn't find it that far fetched."
4,Good movie!,"This was a great futuristic movie, action packed and full of twists and turns. I would highly recommend this one."
2,"cool idea, Dont bother watching, it is too long and just not good","Dont bother with this one. It is a cool idea and you keep waiting for it to ""get good."" It never really does. This could be 1 hour TV show."
2,"Intrigued by the preview, let down by the film","In my search for Blu Ray movies, I remember seeing the preview for this in the theater and thinking it looked interesting.However, this movie pulled off a trifecta for me:Forced acting, film-school level directing and a bad script.All that adds up to a bad movie.I found it hard to keep my focus on the movie, wanting easily to walk away from it.In other words, it wasn't compelling to watch.I really don't understand any talk about this movie becoming a ""cult classic"".Like what? Robocop? Mad Max? Water World?I don't think so.I could never see myself or anyone watching this 20 years from know and saying...""that was so cool""If you must see it, pick it up as a used DVD or stream it."
3,Different,A little different. Quite interesting. I wanted to keep watching it and see what happens. Justin Timberlake it good in most things.
2,horrid,"Two stars for a nice concept. horrible acting, corny, cliche, and anticlimactic writing. overall lackluster. the graphics were also comical...low budget to the extreme."
3,Variation on the Logans Run theme .. good premise fades fast,"This ""time is money"" movie is a variation on the Logans Run idea with a little bit of modern political commentary thrown in.The premise was good and actually the first 40 minutes was interesting .... but then it quickly fell into repeated chase scenes, one liner jokes, and stopped being a serious heavy sci-fi movie and more of a Hollywood formula film"
2,"Horrible Acting, Hokey Plot",In Time is a complete waste of time. The acting is horrible and the story line is flat out dumb. The best part of the movie was seeing that Johnny Galecki from Big Bang Theory can do something other than play a nerdy PhD.
1,mainstream train in action.,"I never watch anything mainstream but this title promising something edgy catch my wallet and I bought it used--good move Kawasaki! Movie is straight forward without anything meaningfull. The concept of using time as universal currency is not bad but what happened to all welfare people if even working class dont have enough for tomorrow and half of population dont pay any taxes? This is the question. I kinda expect to see future as is, instead, for no reason males and females share apartments without having connections or sex. We kinda expect to see man and woman engage in bedroom actions--no way this happens on mainstream train.But plenty of standard gun/killing action in public places. Avoid!"
2,Yuk!,"I couldn't finish the movie....just toooo bad! The overall concept was good, but the execution was just poorly done. Better luck next 'time'! haha."
3,"Time goes on,...and on...and on","This movie is an example of a good concept that has been poorly executed.Tepid, watered down substance. Palatable, but it could have tasted so much better.The notion of a set time to live, time as currency and, of course, the hierarchy and bureaucracy that keeps the upper echelon on top and the poor in the ""ghettos.""A class warfare predicated on age old notions of the rich oppressing the poor. Not far off base, but again...very ""PG-13.""Timberlake is really just fair in this film and, while Amanda Seyfried is just stunning her talents are wasted in this. The modern day Robin Hood meets Bonnie and Clyde.I get it, It was fun in the beginning, but as time wore on it...wore on and on and on.Watch it for some minor thrills, some pretty faces and for a great concept that might make you think, but don't expect the movie to go too deep. It doesn't."
1,WOULD HAVE WALKED OUT IF WATCHED IN THEATER!,limited acting capabilites...limited direction...limited effects...limited period...I never wanted to walk away more from a movie. won't be recommending it to anyone.
3,Interesting concept about time being currency.,"I like science fiction movies and what could happen in the future. This movie made you feel how precious time really is, especially when it means life or death. Justin Timberlake was good in it. I liked it because of the science fiction and the concept. If you like them kind of movies then I think you will enjoy it."
1,JOKE OF THE CENTURY,"This is the biggest joke ever, i laughed the whole movie but i was bored at the same time, don't try to tell me there was a message behind it... People who like this movie are just simply lost, have fun this is the joke of the century."
5,Loved it!,I love Sci-Fi and I wasn't disappointed with this one! Justine Timberlake was impressive in this role and pulled it off perfectly. Great storyline and a movie worth adding to your collection.
4,lots of fun,"great workout for adults and kids, fun sets and music and not too long. my sister and her daughter loved it"
5,Fast Paced Suspense,"If you like a book that keeps you on the edge of your seat pick up Compulsive Behavior. A look into the the minds of some exceptional people and the compulsions that rule us all. An exciting, nailbiting ,exceptionally vivid read Compulsive Behavior is a great book that won't let you put it down.A mother and her autistic son are propelled into terror as they inadvertently become witnesses to a murder. Mrs. Little captured the day to day hurdles of living with autism and drove them home for me by putting them in a setting of suspense. As well as the the unique perspective that an autistic person brings to a situation.This book is also a window into drug abuse and how far down it can take your life. Many people would not associate a rural area with drug abuse and this glimpse will be quite an eye opener.This book is realistic and there is some rough language, but it is relevant to the story and not excessive."
5,awesome,we need more books like this!this book make me smile!i read all the black panthers racist books i read books on how the white man is the devil!now read the book that will solve the problem in the usa!
4,Helpful and straight forward.,"Many kudos to Deborah Cohen for writing the Breast Cancer survival guide. While there are many on the market, this one is straight forward and while not delving too deeply into her specific diagnosis or treatment, it details what a breast cancer patient can expect in terms of overall treatments (surgery, radiation, chemotherapy). I would recommend it to anyone with stage 0, 1, or 2 cancer. It does not address further advanced cancer."
5,"Informative and reassuring, without being scary","I received a diagnosis of breast cancer a few months after my fortieth birthday and spent a year undergoing treatment by surgeries and chemotherapy. While I read many books and articles on the subject, this is the only book I actually purchased and kept close at hand. In my personal experience, I found the information it contained to be accurate, and I appreciated that it was presented in a manner that was easy to understand, without being scary or negative."
2,Time to Quit!,"I regret my decision to stop reading this novel despite all the other positive reviews but it was just toooooooo looooooooooong of a song to keep me engaged! I stayed with it until I just couldn't see where and when I was going to get anywhere with it so, maybe sadly, I'm abandoning this. I was not familiar with the writer and nothing thrills me more than to have a BIG book that is supposedly a ""must-read"" but this choice had the BIG happening for me but not the ""must-read"" part anymore."
2,Neither fish nor foul,"This is not a book of ideas - it is a loose tapestry of music theory and the physics of time woven around a weak narrative concerning characters that do not engage the reader on any emotional level.The exposition, through inner thought and the scant experience of the characters about race in America, is interesting, especially when placed against the Jewish experience of the boys' father but that's all there was for me. I don't care what happens to Jonah - he's too lost in his world, too much not of the real world to be a proper character. I don't understand why Ruth abandoned everyone in her life - who taught her, what was the turning point - she was too young when her mother died for that to be it.I wish I cared for the characters, I wish I wasn't so bored with the musicology and I wish it had all fit together better."
4,Perfect for international travel,"I purchased this charger for a recent trip to Europe. After matching the appropriate prong attachment with the wall socket, I attached the plug to the converter and then inserted the USB cable into the converter as well.Everything worked perfectly and I had full use of my Blackberry for the next two weeks in Italy.This travel charger does not come with any instrucitons, which might be useful to assuage the apprehensions of those who are not familiar with other nations' standard electrical outlets."
2,No description of sized for connection (Micro/Mini),"The description of this product did not state that the connection was a mini, because of this I purchased this item and I needed to purchase another charger with the micro connection."
1,Does not if Blackberry Tour,"If you are ordering this for the Blackberry Tour, it does not fit. The charger is not a Micro-USB charger."
5,I would give it 10 stars if it were possible,"This book is totally awsome; I've passed it around the whole church to read and had to buy several more copies as it would disappear along the route. In a nutshell, it is about Joseph tending to baby Jesus as Mary is resting, and then it is about Jesus visiting Joseph as he is resting on his death bed. What a unique concerpt in a story. I get goosebumps just thinking about it and am thinking of reading it for the 4th time. Don't borrow it, buy it!"
3,Black May review,"Very detailed book for the enthusiast. If you want a play by play of the German submarine history of WWII, this is the book. As a non-fiction book, however, it is not a page-turner and becomes slow reading at some points. Overall, an excellent book with a wealth of submarine history."
4,"VERY, VERY INFORMATIVE","MICHAEL REYNOLDS HAS CREATED A MASTERPIECE OF THE ACTIONS AT NORMANDY AFTER THE INITIAL LANDINGS. UNLIKE OTHER AUTHORS WHO SOMETIMES SHOW THEIR BIAS IN ONE FORM OR ANOTHER, HE HAS SHOWN THE INCOMPETANCE OF SOME OF THE HIGHEST RANKING ALLIED COMMANDERS AT NORMANDY. ONE OF THE OTHER REVIEWERS HERE HIT THE NAIL ON THE HEAD WHEN HE STATED THAT THE ALLIES WON PRIMARILY BECAUSE OF MATERIAL SUPERIORITY AND HITLER'S INCOMPETANT DECISIONS."
3,Loved it til it broke -,"Bought this about 18 months ago. Absolutely LOVED it. Great for two kids - easy to cook frozen pizzas, etc. No waiting for 20 minutes to heat up the big oven, then forgetting it was heated, then forgetting food was in the heated oven ..... So this made for very efficient cooking.A few weeks ago it broke. At first we thought it was a thermo-coupler. It was -- but that got fried because the fan failed. So we are throwing it out. Now the dilemma -- buy this lovely oven AGAIN knowing that it will die in 18 months or take a chance on something else that will probably last longer?"
3,toaster review,"It's probably a better 2nd oven than a toaster. Over 4 minutes to toast a slice of bread, and then only warm and a little dried. Cheese generally unmelted."
2,Can be a better design,"The oven looks very nice, and there is a separate warmer section which is very good. I can use it to warm up stuff while using the toaster oven to roast. But the inner height of oven is smaller due to design of the separate warmer section. For my old toaster oven(different band), I can easiy roast a chicken or pork shoulder, but when I use this oven, the chicken or the pork will touch the top of the oven and become burn. I am little bit disappointed about this. And suppose it is a convection oven, will cook faster. But I find it the opposite, it takes me longer to cook (I compare it with my old toaster oven which is a convention oven). And also for the boiler, it is not so powderful, it takes longer to get the food get brown. Tell you the truth I am thinking about return it to find out is there any problem with my oven or it is design like that."
4,Item Came Broken,"The item was porly packaged inside a box that was 6-8 inches to big around all sides with plastic bags filled with air for cushioning (which half of them were popped prior to arrival). The outer box was crushed and had no indication of it being fragile, glass, handle with care, etc. Item was checked and had broken plastic pieces and the door was broken off. The item was refused and sent back to where it came from. Purchsed the Item on my own at Linens and Things and saved 20+ dollars."
3,good baker - poor toaster,"Using the T-Fal as a toaster is time consuming and exasperating. There are not enough time settings for toast-- either 4, 5, or 6 minutes. The broiler doesn't set any speed records either."
5,Excellent product,Researched a lot of toaster ovens. Always came back to this one. Bought it and have NO regrets.
3,convection fan noise,"since the purchase of this convection toaster oven,I have used the bake feature twice. each time the fan made an intermittent scraping noise. the nosie would continue all through the baking .IS THIS NORMAL FOR THIS APPLIANCE?PLEASE ADVISETHANK YOU"
1,What a disappointment!,"Purchased this in hopes it would quickly toast up bread for my three kids, and it takes literally 9 minutes to toast a single slice! What a waste of money. It has a large footprint, so it eats up precious counter space, has no interior light and, worst of all, bakes, rather than toasts bread. Bread comes out stiff and difficult to chew. Am going back to a 4 slice basic toaster oven for a fraction of what I spent on this inefficient machine."
4,"love it, BUT......","The first one of this oven was a Christmas Gift. Last month, we woke up one morning and the glass on top had splattered to bits! We thought maybe we just got a ""lemon"" so we ordered another one.....it's working great so far and we love making bagels in it!4 thumbs up!"
5,Great Toaster Oven,"This is a great toaster oven. We bought it mainly as a small oven, and it's wonderful. It cooks evenly and predictably, it's large enough for a pizza or small casserole dish, and the countdown timer makes it easy to use. It looks nice, and the bread warmer on top is a plus. We've used it for 9 months with no issues, energy savings (vs. using our main oven), and great baked items. We haven't used the toaster function much, so I can't comment on that. It would be nice if the controls allowed you to set the time more quickly than by just counting up/down from 30 min, but it's a small bother."
5,A Real Price Performer,"I recently purchaced the Avante Convection Toaster oven, and it is better than I expected, even after reading the excellent reviews. It is easy to use, easy to clean, and just the right size. I would have expected to pay more for this much quality."
4,a good little oven,"I ordered this when I realized that sadly, my oven was not working properly and it was going to be a while before a replacement or repair man showed up. The reason for the four stars is the wire racks go in a little stragely, at least the top one does, the bottom one is fine. Still it is fuctional and cooks and toasts quickly and evenly, and that is really what I was after. Easy to program and the alert is just loud enough to let you know your food is done. I chose free shipping and it arrived super fast."
4,Great Totaster Oven,"Great oven to cook small meals in. It cooks just like a large oven but is so much more energy efficient and doesn't heat up the whole room. The fan is relatively quiet also. I haven't mastered getting the toast right yet but didn't really buy it for the toasting, needed it for cooking. It's doing a great job of that. It also warms everything very quickly. I like the warming feature on top. Only thing I don't like is that there is no stop for the rack when taking baked items out of the oven and you pull the rack out. Rack has a tendency to dip down making the baked item slide off if you're not careful."
4,Toaster should come with snooze alarm,"I have had my oven for about a month.It was mainly bought to replace and old Black and Decker that was put to rest after 7 years. We are big toast fans, and use it every day for breakfast bread and bagel toasting. Though the bread toasts, and pretty evenly, it takes at least 4 and sometimes 4.5 minutes to toast a slice of bread. I am disappointed that it takes that long. I haven't used the oven much yet for baking/roasting, etc. but when I did, it did a good job. So if you are mainly buying this to toast, and want it to be faster, you may go with something else."
5,Attack,"Listening to Massive Attack brings me spasms of joy. A great group and album. Massive Attack alongside Gorrilaz, Enigma, Chambre Noir, and Depeche Mode sure bring the stink out of mainstream radio. If only they would play more songs from these groups radio would not be dead."
3,Missing CD,"The description said that it came with CD ""Includes easy-to-use CD with over 50 certificates and award templates"". After I received it, it did not have it. But the selling company replied my e-mail and said that ""I checked the amazon listing and do not show that it stated that the CD would be included"".The purpose for me to order it is to find the CD to have templates. If you want some thing with templates, do not buy it."
2,"Eh, nothing special...","Did the whole cleaning bit, even sanded a bit, but after a week the paint started to chip off...now it looks like crap, but for the 5 days I had it on, wasnt too bad. I think High temp spray paint would last longer, but havent tried yet..."
1,Lole Eco Top,"The product was poorly represented. The fabric was uncomfortable and description of product incomplete. However, shipping was very fast, and when I returned the item, I had no difficulties."
3,a language chanllenge,The only reason I am giving this item 3 stars is because it does not come with a booklet manual that one can follow along. I have started listening to the cd's; it is like doing it blindly. It might useful for the non visual learner. Bit for me I am more of a visual learner.
3,?,"We received the order with only a empty packaging box without CDs inside. I left a messege on the phone number provided, but nobody called. Then I sent E-mail to the seller to report the missing CDs and received prompt reply. A replacement was later sent to me."
5,Worked for me.....,"After 4 days of waiting, I caught a large rat in a snap trap (picture uploaded). I would definitely recommend this gel attractant. However, don't use this gel on a wooden trap outdoors because if it rains, the gel will run all over the board. It's best to use this gel with the plastic snap traps only because those have a tiny cup to hold bait such as this gel."
1,Does nothing; deserves zero stars,"I was suspicious when I stuck the freshly opened bottle right under my nose and smelled -- nothing. Maybe a faint whiff of chocolate and peanut butter, but only because I was expecting something like that. I thought maybe mice perceive odor differently. I'm sure they do, but not this stuff. I baited one trap with peanut butter and one with this gel. The peanut butter caught a mouse. Tomcat Gel caught nothing. I wrote email to the company. No response after five days.Peanut butter on a cracker crumbled onto a sticky board and D-Con poison work for me."
2,Disppointed Expectations,"I am a Christian who does quite a bit of Bible reading. The bible I mainly use has lots of interpretation remarks. I also have several other study guides.I thought purchasing this particular book would have a very simplified explanation for some of the harder books of the Bible. Indeed it does, but at times I found some of the ""the humor"" to border on disrespect of this great book--meaning the Bible.I would recommend it for people who are beginning their study of the Bible, or for someone who just wants an overview.Perhaps it was my own mistake in purchasing this book,believing that I didn't have enough knowledge and/or resources already."
2,Click Here For Vapid Novels,"I read the two books by Donna Andrews about the adventures of Turing Hopper, the AI detective, ""You've Got Murder"" and ""Click Here For Murder"". These two books are written as shallowly and simplistically as any Nancy Drew or Tom Swift adventure.Adventures they are, however, so, if naive, juvenile, straightforward prose and univocal storytelling, style and plot is what you are looking for, these two books are worthy of your time. I recommended both of them to my fifteen year old daughter.I admire that the author produced these two books and is evidently working on yet a third. She is an ardent writer, brimming with energy. Very likely, she won't stop at three or even four installments. She will continue to owe special thanks to ""all the readers who, like (her own protagonists,) Maude and Tim, didn't have any problem believing that Turing was real."" I daresay I will continue not to number among them."
4,hot ice,nora roberts has done it again. her characters just make you feel like you know them in real life. her stories compel you to see what is going to happen and if your ideas about where it is going or if she is going to take you some other direction altogether
2,Disappointing to say the least!,"I had just finished ""Carnal Innocence"" which I really enjoyed. So it was with great enthusiasm that I picked up my second Nora Roberts book, ""Hot Ice."" Sure, I had heard about Nora Roberts but I hadn't yet read her until ""Carnal Innocence.""""Hot Ice"" is truly disappointing. If I hadn't read ""Carnal Innocence"" first, I would be thoroughly perplexed as to reason for Roberts' fame. I have no sympathy for the characters. A mismatched couple on a treasure hunt and on the run from a truly nasty man who has a torture chamber, Whitney is too vain to don authentic native dress to avoid recognition and capture...she refuses to look ""dowdy"" and applies make-up. Her continual whining for fashion and beauty (she actually says ""I broke a nail; now what am I supposed to do?!"") is pathetic. The hero is no hero but a thief. The book is drudgery to read."
5,Time Life Treasure of Christmas II,What a great way to listen to Christmas music by many different artists. Love this CD and all the music. Makes me think of my younger day with my children growing up and enjoying Christmas with my husband and them. this was mailed on time and in great condition. Would recommend seller again.
1,Not Helpful,"This book is essentially useless. It is filled with silliy things like ""learn to read food labels"" (duh), ""listen to music while you excercise"", ""spend some time with elderly people"" (I am elderly).Etc., etc.If you really want to know about prediabetes and how to prevent its progression to type 2 diabetes, look elsewhere. Unless you are into touchy-feely bromides, that might made you feel good, but don't help anything. I take it back. If you don't know what food labels mean, and you are not aware that starches convert to sugar, or that dancing is excercise, or that it's helpful to stay trim and active, then this book might be a wealth of information for you."
4,tractors,Great artist! I woud recomend this to all music lovers. the tractors i have missed you glad to find it
5,cd,"purchased "" tractors"" cd for my dj business...product was in great condition, very affordable,and delivery was very fast..great experience,would buy from seller again,and would recommend seller to others"
1,"Good fiction, but...","Remember how Ronald Reagan told the story about a welfare queen who bilked the government out of hundreds of thousands of dollars using false identities? It was discovered to be false, yet his supporters still said the message was important.That's what has been happening with Mike Davis and ""City of Quartz"". Davis' use of facts in the book have been very spotty, and the book might not hold too much merit. Without facts, what's left?""City of Quartz"" would be great fiction of a sci-fi dystopia, but it is a poor source for a non-fictional account of Los Angeles."
1,"Dull, poorly written, sloppily researched book","I wish I'd paid more attention to the poor reviews here before ordering this, and less to the William Gibson blurb. The research is poor, the writing is dull, sanctimonious and irritating. Unlike some commentators here I didn't mind the tendentious, anticapitalist stance (was quite looking forward to it). What I minded was the accumulation of small and obvious errors in a work of non fiction (suspension of disbelief applies as much in non fiction as fiction) and a prose style like a boiled pudding.First book I've ever ordered from Amazon that I wished I'd skipped. (And I read the first 50 pages in the bath -- otherwise I'd've sent it back.)"
2,Tediously Marxist,"Davis is infected with the idea that nothing good happens unless it is progress towards Socialism, and nothing bad happens when it is performed by the ""marginalized"" or ""alienated"" of society. This idea blinds him to the vigor any dynamism of Los Angeles, and to the benefits that have accumulated to anyone other than the rich, or the middle-class white homeowners who are the secondary demons of his story. If one is capable of filtering out all the marxian cant and ""un-class-angle"" the text, it can be quite informative on both the shifts of the power structure in Los Angeles and the sources of the Tax Revolt of the 1970s and 1980s, but the book is otherwise an unrewarding slog."
4,Good product,Good product. These closeup lenses are perfect for my digital SONY camera. Price is a little bit exensive but it is OK.
2,Lifeless,"This could have been great but somewhere along the way Neil Diamond must have lost it. He's got a great voice and has at least occasionally interpreted other writers' material quite well before. There are only two tracks that I consider as being up to Diamond standard: ""As Time Goes By"" and ""Windmills of Your Mind"". The other 18 tracks all sound dull and uninspired, as if ND wasn't really in to the songs when recording them.And what really upset me is that the original 2 CD release could have easily fit on one disc as the total combined playing time is just a little over 60 minutes."
4,Diamond takes a great risk,"Thirty four years ago Neil brings us ""Solitarie man"",""Shilo"" and an interminable list of great tunes.Now he takes a great risk recording an album with a collection of movie's favourites that perhaps makes some people shake their heads in disaproval.But he's still a powerfull singer and his voice preserves all its bright and tenderness,specially in themes like ""Ebb tide"",""The windmills..."",""Moon river"" and ""Can't help fallin' in love"".Diamond is a great showman and he takes his audience (specialy the femenine ones)to a very particular ""nirvana"".The Bernstein arranges are,in most of the cases,very pleasent ones."
1,Worst Diamond album of all time.,"It is close between ""Up on the Roof"" and this thing. ""The Movie Album ""just plain stinks. I sense Neil had this one forced on him by the record company."
1,"Stick to what you do so very well, Neil.","A fan since the beginning, I am disappointed. It's like Barbra Streisand trying to sing Rap. Neil, please stick to what you do like nobody else can."
4,Leslie Harvey lives!,The tragic death of Leslie Harvey took the wind out of the sails of this great live band....so it is nice to hear some new live releases that give at least a hint of what STC were like on stage. But to see Maggie Bell strutting her stuff and the energy flow between her and Leslie...that was something else. The memory lives on......
5,Brazil at its best.,"Marcelo D 2 is the most fresh individual brazilian artist on the samba/rap scene. This CD will be a inspiration for any listener, latin, caucasian or whoever. It is pure energy - and the rapping/singing/rhytmical skills this guy has - olala! Buy it. It is the best music Brazil can offer in our time."
5,Florida Key Hurricane of 1935,Excellent book if you are interested in the history of the Florida Keys and how the Hurricane of 1935 effected the outcome of Flagler's railroad that was completed and went all the way to Key West. A must read. This book is not published anymore so you will need to find it online at Amazon.
2,"So far not , so good.",Easy installation and so far the wipers work great. Will wait until next winter to see if they pass the real test.Didn't last a year. Started leaving black marks on the glass. Won't buy again.
5,Great Wipers,Have had these on my BMW 330 for about 3 months. They work perfectly in Oregon winter rain. Wipe windshield clean without streaking or chattering. Much better than other wipers I have on my other vehicles. Buy these!
1,Battery doesn't fit well in charger,"As soon as I placed the battery in the charger, the light showed as red, indicating it needed to be charge. This is normal. However, seconds after letting go of the battery, the light went out (not green, indicating full charge.) Again, I pushed it into place and the same thing happened. I thought maybe it arrived already charged (unlikely, but...) I placed the battery in the camera. It only lasted for a short time before showing the battery was low, then dead. Basically the battery won't click fully into place in the charger, allowing it to charge. This battery is listed as the proper replacement for the original Olympus battery, and yes, it fits the camera, but you can't charge it!"
1,Not a translation,"This is not a translation of the Quran. This is Rashad Khalifa claiming to have received a revelation from God in the form of an ""Authorized"" English version of the Quran, which is the most ridiculous statement he could have made. Knowing that he couldn't come up with anything on his own to support his desire to form a cult with himself as its prophet, he attempted to take the truth in the Quran and modify it to fit his beliefs. This book doesn't even deserve to have the word ""Quran"" in it's title."
5,Classic Leon Returns,"This album is definitely for those who appreciate the classic sounds of Leon Redbone. If you were disappointed in previous recent albums that seemed to depart from the Redbone style of his early years, you will be in for a treat with this album. It sounds more like early Leon Redbone than the early albums did! A definite ""thumbs up"" for this one is in order."
3,kind of flimsy,"This pad could be larger and thicker. It seems a little overpriced for what you get. When they say ultra light, they aren't kidding. I also left this outside for a couple of days by mistake. It survived, but was the worse for wear."
1,what the ............?,"well, at first sign it seems a very interesting movie. The story stars good, the gore is good even the actors are good. But there are a lot of problems, first of all the ending is too obvious, you can figure out really fast. Then the gore scenes are ridiculous, i mean how can a person cut off their fingers without make any expression and there is another scene when a girl is falling from the ceiling and the body explodes like a blood bomb!, those moments are very stupid that doesn't shock you that makes you laugh.Just before the end, the movie turns somehow into a musical, the good story turns senseless, stupid, obvious. i really don't recommend to buy this movie but is worth see it, at least you learn something about japanese cuulture."
1,The Content,"This review will be short lived as 30+ five star reviews have already backed this movie.I felt the movie was done in very poor taste. There is a way to handle the subject but it was almost as if they filmed this movie because ""ohh suicide! What a marvel!"" By no means am I bashing the movie because of the gore, gore is a part of our reality but the movie lacked a tasteful plotline. I have to say the skin shreds were a bit much as well.I'm sure things like this do happen but when you put it into a film there's a line between being real and taking it too far. I strongly advise no one under 17 to watch this movie.I'm sorry to those that did like it but this is just another person's opinion."
1,Even Glam Rock Can't Save This Movie,"This movie started out OK. The cutesy school girls committing suicide was a good time, and there was even an excess of blood spraying on bystanders. The movie even held up about 45 minutes in, that is, until the main character committed suicide. Roll Credits. No actually, there is an hour left. This is when the movie divulges into a meaningless, directionless waste of film. The first half of the movie was building you up, and was actually pretty cool and interesting. With a quick pull of a trigger, the whole plot, character development and movie go into the toilet. I can only assume that this movie was intended to shock, but ends up falling infinitely short. It seems the director forgot that without coherency, nobody would care. If you want a good gore-fest shock-cinema movie, see Riki-Oh, or even Battle Royale. If you want a well-done, frightening movie, see Audition. Whatever you do, don't waste your money on this trite abomination of a film."
4,Jisatsu Sakuru,"Well, I officially came to the conclusion, after seeing time and tide and a few others, that Modern Asian movies do not like to fall into the cliche'd five-part plot summary genre, and thus at some point in the plot will go on a little tangent till the movie ends. But hey, that's fine with me. I liked this movie, can't say that I understood it all too well, but in some manner I felt resolved in the end. I would say more, but I don't want to be a spoiler. See the movie, and don't eat before hand. =)"
3,Mi Casa Quilting,I am a longarm quilter and this does not assist me with my longarm quilting. I would recommend this book for both longarm and domestic machine quilting patterns.
3,Unexpected Treasure,"I stumbled on this accidentally and thought it looked rather neat. I could imagine it a great way to help teach kids map skills. It is 6 maps of fairy tale lands, each map has a set of directions to find a treasure at the end. The format of the book is a bit problematic as the illustrations are rather small, making the directions harder to follow and the spine creates a problem when measuring distances on the map, as it is right in the middle of said maps. All in all a very neat idea."
1,"Movie nice, DVD is not.","The Barbie movie is okay for my daughter, no problem there. But it takes about 5 minutes to come across all the adds and other unwanted stuff about other movies. My DVD player isn't allowed to skip all this. My daughter has the same problem as I have in this matter. Terrible. Apparently I should look for the illegal copies *without* the adds and so on. That is what I want since I've *paid* for the official DVD."
4,Pleasantly surprised,"We purchared Barbie as The Island Princess for our granddaughter because SHE specifically requested it. We are so familiar with Disney and Noogin heroes that we were afraid Barbie wouldn't measure up. Therefore, we previewed the DVD before giving it as a gift. It was wonderful. The animation isn't as crisp as Pixar or other better known products, but the story line was very good and certainly has a life lesson to impart. Our granddaughter loved it. She has watched it over and over and it has become one of her favorites. We will certainly purchase other Barbie DVDs as Christmas gifts for all our granddaughters (we have four, ages 3 to 7)."
5,Barbie on the Islands,"This Barbie movie is colorful, calm, the music is enjoyable, the story is fun. My grand daughter of 3yrs, & 6 yrs enjoy this movie. They enjoy singing along with them. They enjoy the out takes, and the features that allow them to sing along with Barbie. An enjoyable movie that I don't mind sitting thru. I don't try to analyze simple movies. If they are age appropriate, enjoyable, the children enjoy them - then the movie has met it's goal. Life's too short to not just sit with the kids, a bucket of popcorn and sing along with Barbie. Enjoy."
5,The Island Princess,"To tell you the truth I haven't watched this one yet. I bought it for my granddaughter and she loves it, so does my daughter and the other grandmother. I have seen a couple of the other Barbie movies and they are very good. I usually don't like animated movies but the animation in these movies is beautiful, plus the stories are excellent. They really hold your attention. My daughter said this is one of the better ones."
5,You'll have to hide it,"Children between 18 and 24 months love this book. Parents may find they need a break from repeated readings (how many times can you say ""How do you do?"" with enthusiasm?)."
4,very good reference book,This is a great book to have if you are thinking of getting or already have a Chihuahua.
4,Great Book,"This is a great book for anyone with a new chihuahua, as it's very detailed and covers every possible subject. My only complaint is the text-book format, with very little pictures and diagrams used to demonstrate the advice. It makes the book seem quite tedious. But that said, this problem can easily be averted by highlighting/bookmarking the sections most useful.A must-buy for any chi-lover"
5,"Best ""For Dummies"" I've read",This book was very well written and had everything I could possibly want to know about Chihuahuas. The author seemed very knowledgable and that fact that she used to show AmStaffs makes me like her even more. Two thumbs up.
5,Chihuahuas for dummies,"I really enjoyed this book because it had a lot of information on one of my favorite dogs chihuahuas and toy breeds. It also had info on Gidget, the Taco Bell dog. Jaqueline O'Neil is a really good writer. This book is very helpful for people who are getting a chihuahua, or already have one."
3,"Good for beginners, old hat for experienced dog owners.","I purchased this book shortly after adopting my first Chihuahua from a rescue organization. I had owned several and worked with hundreds of dogs previously (I'm a veterinary student) and found this book to be an excellent jumping-off point for those who have little dog ownership experience. However, the material on potty-training, safety, vet care and many other subjects were just standard non-breed specific information. I found myself flipping through the book idly and found very little information that was new to me.If you have never owned a dog, or have little experience with dog ownership and are considering a Chihuahua, definitely buy or borrow this book. But if you have a decade of being a doggy mom (or dad) under your belt, pass this book up for good old research with other Chi owners and breeders. It has enough redundant information to make spending the $16 seem silly."
5,Very Impressive,Simply --Life changing! Chapter 7. The Principle of Causation should be read by all. I have since stop smoking and started Tai Chi classes.
4,Hermetic Teachings,"Wayne Chandler has done a great job with this book. Very detailed and show direct connection with historical facts and the Hermetic Laws. A good book to learn how the Laws works and can be seen in everyday life and history. One problem though, he continues to ""compare"" KMTic Hermetic Laws with writings that are much much younger than TEHUTI LAWS. He does a lot of comparsions with India and Chinese. I never could overstand how one can think they can explain something better by comparing it to another? And the other is a subject most readers do not know about or are not concern with! If it was the Laws in KMT why reference India? What did the Indians do that is more understandable than what the KMTians ORIGINALLY wrote? I felt that I had a more overstanding of India's sufism than I did about KMTic LAWS. So this is why I gave this book 4 fours because of the unnecessary reference to the KMTic LAWS thru Asian eyes."
5,These guys sound like the next big thing.,I was fortunate to see these guys on one of their swings down in NYC. The set was smokin and there wasn't a soul that didn't skank it up. We're fortunate that they've laid down some tracks on disk. These tunes maintain much of the excitement of their live sets. Check it out.
4,"Excellent, Beatle-esque Power Punk/Pop","Boy! The Cheap Trick boys sure went for something different on this album. 'All Shook Up' is quite underrated and contains some of Rick Neilson's quirkiest tunes. Hooky, jagged little pills these songs are, with more punk influence then perhaps some of Cheap Trick's pop fans might have liked, which unfortunately must have hurt them for radio airplay. Cheap Trick must be one of the few big rock bands that didn't sell out commercially, they sold UP artistically! Ahead of it's time, for sure."
5,Outstanding. It's one of Lauper's best.,"Listening to this CD brings out all the joy of the holiday season -- from fun and laughter to sentimental feelings. ""Christmas Conga"" is so much fun, and Cyndi's take on ""Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree"" is simply one of the best versions I've ever heard. ""New Year's Day (First Lullaby)"" is a beautiful track sure to bring a lump to the throat of any parent. ""When I first looked into eyes like mine,"" she sings, ""I wondered what I'd see through them in time."" Just beautiful..."
4,She's so unusually soulful,"I don't like Christmas CDs. Actually, I'm not real big on Christmas itself. But I listen to this even in July.Cyndi has chosen some gems of songs -- infectious, fun,poignant. The buoyant production, all shimmering bells and loose-limbed percussion, to paraphrase Ms. Lauper herself, ""feels like Christmas, just like Christmas."" On the traditionals and her original ballads, she shines through with a soulfulness that is authentic and moving.Putting this on during your Christmas chores suddenly brings those kindergarten class holiday parties into your living room, and Ms. Lauper is your most favorite teacher, 'cause she's goofy, nurturing and still a kid herself. Fun, fun, fun."
3,Accidents in North American Mountaineering,Catalogs all reported climbing accidents and gives how the rescue was carried out. Also gives analysis on why accident happened. Really helpful for people in the outdoor indusrty and for researching climbs/mountains. Learn from others mistakes and hopefully you won't find yourself in these situations.
3,Here's the track listing.,This album is really not that great. Sounds like a cross between Matinee & Albert. A lot of slow songs. Anyway onto the track list. 1. Liz Phair 2. Radio 3. Bus Stop 4. Wonderdrug 5. The Normal Life 6. In The First Place 7. Never Better 8. Unfortunately 9. You Haunt Me 10. El Differente 11. You Love To Fail 12. Welcome Mat 13. Charade. The last two are japanese bonus tracks.
1,No substance!,"I began this novel with high hopes, expecting great things after all the good reviews it has received. I gave up halfway through in disgust. The main character, Lacy, is obviously troubled by childhood abuse, but the blatantly sexual attraction she feels for Black Jesus is a big leap of faith. I loved the turbaned psychologist, she was the high point of the story. Although filled with potential, the characters remain superficial, the plot lacks depth, and I was left wondering what was the author's point. Or, more accurately, I decided that the author's point wasn't worth wading through the second half of the book."
1,"Broken Bones: All form, no substance","An obvious ""workshop"" product, this book has all the proper elements and no soul. The characters are one dimensional, the conflict stays on a superficial level, and the plot tries too hard to be hip. Even worse, the voice is thoroughly inauthentic. Some interesting issues are raised, but the characters can't seem to dig deeply into themselves to find genuine answers. Ultimately, I just didn't care what happened to them. The packaging - great cover and enticing dust jacket notes - are the best thing about this book. I can only assume the author coerced her friends into sending in the rest of the reviews on this page"
4,Great Gag Gift,Recently I needed a wedding gift for a family member. We thought this item would be fun to give this as a gag gift - every wedding needs a toaster. ;)Luckily Amazon had this toaster on sale and it allowed us to wrap a nice looking gift but still put the real gift (a gift card) in the wedding card.The toaster was an instant hit. It's goofy and debatably useful at the same time. The bride and groom definitely remember that gift and who gave it to them. They've also told us it works well for them as both a toaster and radio.
4,It's Got a Great Beat But I Can't Dance to It,"I was overwhelmed when I saw this Toaster Radio sitting on a shelf. Our office toaster had disappeared-- really. Did someone borrow it and forget to mention it? Take it home by accident? I'm no longer concerned, because it was a plain old white toaster. This is an electric blue toaster WITH A RADIO!Toaster works fine. The radio is nothing short of terrible which is why I knocked a star off. But this maybe the only occasion I ever have to quote Samuel Johnson in a toaster review-- please excuse the 18th century sexism:Sir, a woman preaching is like a dog's walking on his hind legs. It is not done well; but you are surprised to find it done at all.Life of Johnson (Boswell). 27 Vol. ii. Chap. ix. 1763.And it's far more useful that if it had been a really good radio with a bad toaster attached."
1,"Barely Adequate Toaster, Dreadful Radio!","I have to say that this is one of the most dismal products I've ever bought. The toaster barely toasts, even when turned all the way up, and helpfully flips over when you press down the handle. It takes two hands to use. The radio, in addition to being the worst-sounding radio I have ever encountered, has to be reset to your channel each time the radio is turned on, and that has to be done by a blind search button. How convenient is that?I assumed that coming from Kenwood, the radio would at least be a decent unit. Wrong.This thing is merely a gag product, and the joke's on the buyer."
4,"Uh, this is not a toy - it's a metal detector sand sifting scoop","Had to laugh about the questions about this tool being a toy. Yes, I'm over 13, I've had fun with my tool (not a toy). It is a durable tool - not a toy.This metal detector sand/dirt scoop is well made. It helps get the soil out of the way when you're trying to find metal objects your metal detector spotted."
1,I hate Cindy Williams,"In the early 90's (pre 9/11) Cindy Williams gave a reporter a story saying that Armed Forces members make way too much money and that we are over paid lazy bums. I'm serving in Iraq right now and I will not buy anything that has her name on it. I'm sure on 9/11/01 she was glad that the armed forces are around, now that she needs us."
3,I would really only recommend this for children who aren't big on reading,"It has an overworld, very simple dialogue, some collectibles scattered around, and about 5-6 different minigames. If you're looking for something to keep a child entertained, it's okay, but it has no educational value and it's not interesting for the adult as well.I would go with any of the Cooking Mama series instead or NintenDogs (warning: the noises can get annoying) for a young child."
4,Great for your younger gamers.,It was ok for my eight year old but she shortly lost interest because it was a very simple game. Younger kids would love it.
5,This is a real classic for the fans of pure Hard Rock,"Rainbow Rising is the most perfect moment of Ritchie Blackmore in the studio. Recorded originally in 1975, the album brings the powerful voice of Ronnie James DIO, the strenght of Cozy Powell on the drums and the magic guitar of Blackmore after de Deep Purple break-up. Mixing classical moments as in STARGAZER and the Hard Rock explosion as in TAROT WOMAN, this recording is a rare moment in the Heavy Metal history. Enjoy it."
5,THE HEAVIEST ALBUM YOU CAN TAKE WITHOUT A PRESCRIPTION!!!,"This absolutely one of the best rock albums of all time for me! This my third copy of the album already. I've got the first copy way back in the late seventies. Played the LP almost every day so it got worn out until it came to a point where I don't like to play it anymore. I bought again the LP in the 80s. When I came to know of Amazon.com I bought it also in CD.Songs like Stargazer, A Light In The Black, Tarot Woman and Do You Close Your Eyes are some of my favorites rock songs of all time too.Listen to Ritchie Blackmore, RJD, Jimmy Bain, Tony Carey and Cozy Powell on this album! This is a master piece in rock!"
2,Disappointed,"Wow - really disappointed with this long-anticipated Deluxe edition of one of my favorite collections of Rainbow - hell, any band - songs of all time. Two discs feature a regurgitation or the same7 tracks appearing on the original album with no material, discernable difference as the songs cross from the NY - LA - Raw - versions. The liner notes are the only redeeming virtue of this set. Nothing new here, I'm afraid. If you have the original album, stand pat on this Deluxe edition; if you don't own this classic album, save yourself a buck and procure the less expense base version."
2,Sounds boring after a while (2.4 stars),"I bought Rainbow Rising because Axel Rudi Pell, the GermanHeavy Metal King, cites it as a main musical influence in his youth. Well here we have an example of the pupil surpassing the master! Repetitious heavy metal without creativity or melody justwon't do it for me; it's OK for 5 minutes after days of musical abstinence but then I'm bored. ..."
5,Intense,"That's what this album is to me, in a word. One of the most intense records I have ever heard, hands down. Heavy metal as a genre was still in it's early stages when this was first released in 1976 and what a statement! This is, no doubt, one of the great metal classics of all time. I don't care what era you come from, if you love heavy music, this is an important album to experience. And I think it's important to point out too, at least from my experience, that this is a singular expressive thought/feeling coming from the band that is best heard as a unit and not just as a grouping of songs. I have this on my iPod but I would still prefer to hear the album the way it was intended, from start to finish. I love this record and am very proud to own it. Get it. You'll be glad you did."
5,Awe-Inspiring,"Not a single weak track here, this is undoubtedly one of the greatest hard rock albums ever conceived; it has ""Stargazer,"" ""Tarot Woman,"" and ""A Light in the Black,"" some of the best rock songs ever written. Everyone is great, from Dio to Blackmore to Powell. Buy it."
5,The Dream Chasers,This is one of the best movies I have ever watched it is a must for anyone who loves movies.
2,"Well, she certainly isn't Sills",Sills' singing of mad scenes far surpasses Sutherland's singing on this disc any day. Sills has more accurate coloratura and a lot more drama. She also doesn't mumble to herself like La Stupenda does.
5,This book helped me out of a major crisis in my life.,This book helped me out of a major crisis in my life. I bought it to give to a friend. I would recommend this book to any woman who is having self esteem issues.
4,A fascinating account of life in the Arctic.,"A fascinating account of life in the Arctic. What a harsh world, where the Inuit seemingly survive on a diet of seal meat and fat, and not much else. This is a very well written book, with crisp exact prose, and a nice dry humour. Sad in places, where the protagonist became the white medicine man, but could not save all those who became sick - losing the girl Nyla was very sad - ""you will live to be an old man, why is it that I must die?"". Recommended."
3,There are better players out there,"Easy to install, but cover to battery and USB connection is flimsy and no real good way to carry item either. Okay sound w/o headphones and relatively simply to operate, but save money and get better player."
2,poor quality,I bought this for my son and it arrived defective. It is poorly made anyway and i am very disappointed. I have never been unhappy enough to write a review before so I hope this will help someone else choose a better option.
1,"DO NOT BUY THIS is you plan on using Napster, Itunes, etc.","When you purchase an ""MP3"" player these days, you're actually expecting to be able to play not only MP3 files, but MP4 files, WMV files, and so forth. This device, however, only actually plays MP3 files, which is noted in very small print in the instruction manual. Music download sites like Napster & Real Rhapsody use WMV format. You can get MP4 through Itunes, but not MP3s. So that means you cannot download ANY music from the big music download sites onto a Shaker. MP3 is now an ""old"" format. Unless you're planning only on ripping songs from a CD to put on the Shaker, DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT! I got this for my son for Christmas & am very disappointed that I cannot download any of his favorite songs onto it. The product description needs to be much clearer about the severe limitations of the product."
3,fun but with some design issues,"i bought this player because i loved the idea of built in Speaker for my son. the speakers are not bad and the mp3 player is kind of cute. in fact, my little one loves it. the only (and big)issue is that the battery/card cover won't stay in place... since the first time we used it!but it just costed 11$ (walmart) and quite often you get what you pay for. i decided to keep it and tape the cover in place... i won't buy my 3 y o boy a ipod any time soon."
3,Cute speakers,These were cute and fun.The child I purchased this for is enjoying playing with the shaker mode and the sound is pretty good for small speakers.
2,Worked great for a while...,The good....I loved that I could let my kids listen to music without worrying about ear damage from headphones. The form factor was great and it was much smaller in person than I realized (a positive).The bad.... it had glitches in the first couple of weeks that required me to take the battery out. Then it just stopped working.Wouldn't buy another one.
2,Stopped working after 6 days,"It was relatively easy to upload music except for the fact that they had to be in MP3 format and without my husband I would never have known how to do that. My son loved it and it had pretty good sound from the speakers, but after less than a week it just all of a sudden stopped working! Such a disappointment..."
4,Great for young users,"We have had this about a year. Recently have had a few problems with it, but working with tech support (which has been excellent) to try and solve it. We have not had a lot of the problems with the battery compartment, etc that others have had. My 2, 5 and 7 year old can all operate this very easily and fight over who gets to hold it. I love that you do not need headphones, since they are all very young and I want them to be able to hear when they are 30 - the entire reason I bought this in the first place. Aside from the recent problem we have had with it, I would have given this an easy 5 stars. I am just hoping this will last longer than a year, but who knows given how things are made nowadays."
2,Sandisk Shaker,"My daughter loves her Sandisk when it is working. From the parent perspective, it was very difficult to load songs on. You have to make sure they are in MP3 format and most computers automatically convert to windows media. After we finally figured that out we have lost the songs completely off of the media card twice. When troubleshooting, we found that the card was corrupt and needed to be re-formatted. When you re-format a card you must erase everything on it so it is a little frustrating."
2,Easy to use if you have the right format of music,"This is the perfect first mp3 player to give your kids....as long as you are able to change your music format to mp3 or pam wav files. I was expecting to be able to download my daughter's music from our windows media player, but no, it all has to be changed to a different format to play. Now I have to buy a program to be able to change the formats of my music so she can listen to it. For me, it would have been cheaper and easier to get a little bit more expensive sansa player that I can throw any kind of music on than buying this one. If I could put my music on it the way it is formatted originally, this would would be the perfect little mp3 player."
5,2 year old loves it!,"We got this as a ""new baby gift"" for our 2 year old. She's really into listening to ""her"" music in the car so we thought it would be great! It's simple enough that she figured it out in minutes and loved having her favorite songs on it. I like the built in speaker that can't get too loud and drive me crazy. She hasn't played with it in a couple of weeks now, but she used to take it to bed with her to listen to her music as she fell asleep and in the car while I listened to my music.Overall, it was a great purchase and wonderful for our little girl!!"
4,Great for the money,"I bought this for my 3 yr. old who loves music. Easy to use, pretty easy to load music especially from a CD. Couldn't upload an mp3 song - don't know if I'm doing it correctly so I'm not sure if it's me or the sansa shaker. As for other reviews where the bottom doesn't stay on, you have to turn it until it clicks. To open, you press down & turn (like a prescription bottle), insert your battery, & close by turning with a little pressure until it clicks. Head phones are good - they actually stay in my son's ears and I love that it has a speaker so he doesn't have to use the headphones. Very easy to use, has been dropped once & it still works so it's sturdy. I would recommend this item - in fact I have. I'm also getting one for my 6 yr. old"
5,We love it!,"Santa brought this for my daughter who is 5! We love it! It sounds really good and she can operate it while dancing! It was a little tricky to download songs on it--I tried to do it from itunes, but, I didn't realize that itunes had 'protected' files so it wouldn't let me just automatically download them to the shaker. I downloaded them to a disk and then uploaded them to the shaker...sure, it was an extra step, but once I figured it out, it was very easy. We love that it has a speaker--and, for the money, it holds plenty of songs and the sound is a good quality. No complaints!"
2,definitely coud be better,"well, the little speaker workd great... good sound for such a small thing... HOWEVER, I've had so many problems with it! ...I bought 2 of them for my kids, and we've had problems with the shaking feature not working, with the music not wanting to turn on or turn off (have to pop the battery out & back in to fix this) and now, the hatch cover for the battery is broken completely off one of them, which renders it useless... and they're not even a month old! ...I'd definitely have gotten a different kind had I known all this beforehand!"
3,ok,can only get it to download mp3 even though it says you can download wavs so my daughter only has 4 songs on it so thats disappointing other than that its ok
2,Broke the first day,"Santa brought this for our 8 year old daughter. It was on the top of her Santa wish list and so she was very excited to get it. But then she opened it. It never really functioned properly, which I figured was due to ""operator error"" (the 8 year old) so I tried myself to use it. By the end of the first day it wouldn't even turn on anymore. Very disappointing.I don't quite know how we'll send this back to the North Pole for replacement..."
4,mom of two,My six year old daughter loves this MP-3 player. The only problem she has is the button-type earphones do not fit in her ears very well.
2,"Oi, what a seder?","A broad range of Jewish-related-topic movies varies from ""Trembling Before G-D"" to ""The Holy Land"", where Jewish humor, emphasis on the Holocaust and musical inclusions are predominantly accustomed features of. Of course, modern Israeli cinematograph concentrates more on day-by-day Israeli reality, incorporating h o h m e s (sarcastic jokes) if necessary.Something more linking to a secular modern American reality supposedly depicted in this film does not impress me at all because of a surrealistic mixture of sex-bent traditionally-characteristic inter-religious-confession-gesheft (profit) pieces of gay-lesbian-adultery-quickie-drug-secular-Hasidic traces of affairs, which is too much for one hour plus story of enjoying their seder continuingly.Sorry, it is definitely not my cap of tea. If even this play is R-rated."
4,Harsh Nu-Metal From The North Of England,"The third and probably the best ablum from Kill II This, harsh metal tracks and some intreasting vibes from the four from the north ... also an intreasting cover of franky goes to hollywood's 2 Tribes, giveing the eighties clasik a Nu-Metal make over"
1,"Quran, Hadith and Islam",This is the most useless book I have purchased. There is no logical flow in the book. There seems no connection between chapters.
1,This book is by the Heretical Cult called SUBMITTERS,"Rashad Khalifa created a new Sect in the 1970's called SUBMITTERS. Their number is less than 100. Mostly based at Tucson Arizona.Other Muslims regard this group as Evil Heretics.The Beliefs of Rashad Khalifa are as follows:Rashad Khalifa is a Messenger from God.Rashad Khalifa visited Heaven & saw all the Prophets.The Quran contains False Verses.Rashad Khalifa has removed these Verses from his translation.All the other Muslims are Idolators & Pagans.There is a Secret Mathematical 19 based Code in the Quran.Pig Fat & other parts are ok to eat. Only Pig meat is forbidden.The World will end in 2280 AD.Circumcision is not allowed.Needless to say, you will NOT learn ACCURATE information about Islam from this heretical groupThe Following Quran Translations are better than the one produced by this group.Abdul Majid DaryabadiA.J ArberryM Mamaduke PickthallA Yusuf AliMuhammad AsadDr Muhammad Muhsin Khan & Dr Muhammad Al-Hilali"
1,Book Produced by A Mentally Arberrated Person,First of all Rashad Khalifa never produced any solid proofs for his notions and he never forthwith any historical facts. He MISTRANSLATED most of the Qur'anic Verse to vindicate his claim and SUBSTITUTED the Original Quran with his own satanic-version translation of quran...as a matter of fact..he never used origianl quranic verse in all his claims thus it falls flat!...I wish i could give negative 1000 for the star
1,A Total Misrepresentation of Islam,This book is full of incorrect translations and references. I would highly doubt the author's honest intentions. I wouldn't recommend this book to any student of religion and deeply express my sympathy to all muslims.
2,Broke While Setting,This watch is beautiful but one of the crowns came off when setting it the first time. I am still working to resolve. My experience is that the product quality is not evident.
5,Lovely pop up book,This is a really nice pop up book. It would be a great gift for someone or to keep and enjoy yourself.
4,very fast arrival,"I ordered this syrup on Monday with standard shipping and Thursday night it arrived. Shipping is more then most items on Amazon, but with such a fast turn around rate I wouldn't let that keep you from ordering this product."
1,We don't recommend this toaster - ours broke in 5 months!,"This toaster was a Christmas present for my husband. I was very disappointed when it suddenly broke only 5 months after it was purchased. The toaster no longer holds down the bread in the slots. I could spend $13.00 to ship it back to T-FAL for repair, but I'm not sure if it's worth the cost.The ""High-Lift"" feature they claimed did not really raise the bread high enough so we ended up using our fork to pick up the bread. It toasted one side of the bread darker than the other. The slots were too small/narrow to accommodate our favorite rosemary bread from the local bakery."
2,Finally a CD thats fun for children and their parents,"Reviewer: Mary K ScruggsYou can't go wrong with this entertaining music cd for children. From the wonderful whimsical calypso beat with ""Colors Everywhere"" to the soulful bluesey dobro on ""Penny, Nickel, Dime and Quater"" (my 2 personal favorites) you and your kids will be dancin' in the den! My [...] boy loves to laugh with ""Uno Dos Tres"" while he is learning to count in Spanish! We also take this in the car and as soon a I turn on the radio I hear requests (demands) to listen to Ray! Thanks for the fun!"
5,CUlinary Math has lots to offer,"For those in the food trade or those who are learning the food trade, Culinary Math has a lot to offer. It is a refresher on on conversions, costing, metric, and much more. This book focuses on they types of math needed to build a standard recipe, convert a recipe, work out total costs and more. As much a workbook as a math text, the exercises are useful in setting these mathematical principles into your mind and is a good preparatory for on line certification in cost control. For those people who have been out of school for awhile and those who are weak in math, this book will be a tremendous help."
5,Butterfly Net of Words,"In this brilliantly understated masterpiece W. Somerset Maugham slips the timeless theme of mysticism into the time-bound narrative of a novel. It is a class act with all the charm of a daguerrotype. The protagonist is a war hero who gradually withdraws from the world of ego and money inhabited by the social-climbing narrator, who is himself divided between high society and inner happiness. Of course, they are mirrors of each other: Boddhisatva. The excellent old movie based on the book catches the action but misses the nirvana behind the samsara that Maugham captures for us in his butterfly net of words. This has been a high-falutin' Zen review."
3,Not as represented,"It's not really about one man's search for transcendence. It's more about everyone else's reaction to him. The whole search is covered in Chapter Six, which is all you need to read if you are into the eastern philosophy in the book. Maugham starts the chapter off by saying you don't have to read it at all. But that's only if you're interested in the Paris Hiltons of the day. Very dull stuff, no matter how accurate and well-written in the style in use then -- Maugham's style involves a lot more ""telling"" than we are used to nowadays, and a lot more overt misogyny. He was homosexual, although his portrait of the shallow ""old cissie"" in the book is equally unkind."
5,On meeting Larry Darrell,"It is not because the author is Somerset Maugham that I like The Razor's Edge so much, but because of the story he weaves as Larry seeks spiritual enlightenment. It is not unlike so many of us have tried or dreamed of. It was only after running into a web page on the net recently by a man that met Larry in person, did I obtain a new copy and re-read it. I had read the book many years ago and because of it, tried other Maugham novels, but none of them really hit the mark like The Razor's Edge. Well worth reading."
2,Wayne's Review,The record player works fine but the software is a mess. The click removal does not work and the help section is no help. Select a section of a song to make some changes and you can't go back to normal. Zoom in and it seems that the whole view is permanently changed.
3,Feedback problem solved but USB not used or needed,"It's not hard to set up but I didn't like the faint buzzing sound I could hear during quiet passages in a song. I finally solved the problem by disconnecting the USB connection, running the turntable through my old stereo receiver, and then connecting this to the ""line in"" on the computer. Basically, the USB function is useless to me, and I'm using this product as a regular turntable (which I could have bought in the first place, had I known it was this simple!). Otherwise, it works fine as a turntable. Audacity is okay once you get used to it, and the recordings I've made have been pretty good."
4,"Great technology, but. . .","The product is absolutely amazing and works exactly as advertised. The biggest problem I had, and the reason I didn't give it five stars, is that the instruction manual isn't as clear as it should be. I haven't been able to separate tracks, although I've followed everything to the letter. Some step in the process is not indicated in the instruction book. The equipment works well; the tech writer who wrote the manual needs to go back to step one and write instructions for those of us who are novices and doing this for the first time."
3,Meh,"I had to downgrade (read: hack) an audio driver on my Macbook to get the USB audio to work. I have no idea if it has been fixed as of this review (this was last Summer) but why it gotta be like that?Once I had the usb audio driver working, I realized the Ion turntable itself had no grounding apparatus; its signal was awash in white noise. The last thing I want to hear when I am archiving vinyl is noise. I managed to use some analogue trickery a la McGuyver to keep the noise low, but it never went away fully.My 3rd and final gripe? If you listen closely, there is weird analogue-to-digital conversion noise that gets recorded. Sounds like robots mumbling to one another. Did I mention it gets recorded?If you are STRAPPED for cash and absolutely NEED a usb vinyl solution...Then I guess you gotta do what you gotta do. But for any serious vinyl archiver, I would look into other solutions than this model."
3,Decent,"It does what it says it does, but there is no dust cover. Also, the latest releases from Ion are plug and play in addition to what is offered by this turntable.Does anyone know where one may obtain a replacement belt for this turntable?"
5,Great turntable,The turntable works absolutely great. I used a friends before I bought this and both work well. The only problem I have seen is minor. Adjusting the counterweight was not as simple as it should have been but I did succeed and have it working.
1,Appalling Sound Quality,"I remember what LP's sounded like, and this isn't it.I have several albums of solo classical guitar music in nearly pristine condition. When played on the iTTUSB I hear annoying cracks and pops which do not correspond to the 33 1/3 rpm speed. The pops are random and distinct, like a Geiger counter. There is also an annoying hum, audible in the silent portions of the recordings. Merely hitting the START/STOP button produces a second of crunching, wheezing static that messes up the beginning of the MP3 track!The positive reviews here are simply beyond belief. Anyone old enough to have an LP collection should understand the difference between routine LP defects and shabby electronics. Even if you own a few lovingly worn-out LP's, as I do, the hideous sound quality coming out of the Ion turntable is an insult to their memory."
5,Ion USB Turntable,"I recently purchased the Ion TTUSB turntable so I could transfer my vinyl to digital. I was very pleased with the unit, the design is user friendly, with two large stop/start buttons located at the corners so one doesn't disturb the stylus when finding and recording tracks.The software makes transfer a breeze, just sit back and listen to your oldies and allow the memories to flow back!You can also use Audacity if you want to record and tweak the recording or record 78's by recording them at 33 or 45 and re doing them at 78. Very nice feature for those with 78 records out there.All in all, I am very happy with the unit, the price was right and use is a piece of cake, just plug it in and go!"
4,Glad we got it,"When I heard about a turntable that could turn our old LP's into MP3 files I was thrilled. I read all the reviews and went ahead and bought the Ion. After setting up the turntable my son and I went right to work recording some of my collection and it was easy.It takes time and if you want to separate each song (track), you need to be there to click the arrow on the screen. If you have the time, and you have enough vinyl, the machine pays for itself in i tune purchases alone."
4,No problems,The construction seems cheap but I've had no problems with the unit or the software. Sound quality is good.
2,ION review,"I was very frustrated with the software and the instructions that came along with this item. The software has a lot of clutter and poor instructions. Maybe this software is easier to use if you've had some experience with DJ software or recording music. As for the turntable, there are pretty good instructions for set-up, but that's about it. And why would a turntable come with no cover of any kind?"
1,Haven't gotten one that works yet,"The first turntable arrived in a timely fashion, and after loading the software and setting up the turntable the tone arm would not move to play the record. We call headquarters, they sent us a return mail sticker and back it went. The replacement arrived this past Friday 9/14, and when we unpacked it everything was there except the felt that holds the record stable on the turntable. I called support and they are mailing me one which will arrive in 7-10 days. Today is Sunday 9/16 and it's been a month since I ordered it and still haven't used it. How frustrated would you feel with this situation. If I didn't have a lot of LP's, I'd ask for my money back. The people I've dealt with have been very nice, however I have no idea as to how this product should be rated yet."
1,turntable with USB record,"I had so much hope for this turntable, which would have enabled me to listen and convert my beloved lps to cds. What a disappointment when I hooked it up and found out that it doesn't work. I had to return it for a refund. The one good thing about this purchase/return experience is the amazing speed that Amazon processed my order. The product arrived within a day of ordering, and I received notification of my refund days after I returned the product. Oh well."
2,Too complicated,"When I opened the package and read the instructions, it said I needed a connection between the turntable and computer for sound. So, I sent for a headphone splitter and after I got that I had to go to Radio Shack for two adapters to make the audio cables on the turntable fit into the splitter. When I finally got to recording I couldn't get sound waves to come up and after I went to Help on the ion website, I found out I didn't need the splitter or adapters. So it cost me an additional 20.00 for something I didn't need. And yesterday I sent an e-mail to ion as I still can't get the sound waves to come up and I have received no response. I still haven't been able to get anything into the computer to burn on a CD. Thank you."
3,Low cost USB turntable,Looking for an cheap and easy way to digitize your old vinyl collection? This might be the answer. Light weight plastic basic no frills device. Would have liked it a lot better if it came with a dust cover
2,Turntable,"I purchased this item in October, and have yet to be successful in getting it to work with my Mac G4. The problem may well be with the Audacity software that came with it. The turntable itself, while large, is eye-appealing, lightweight and compact in design. The belt-driven turntable works well, the arm is, while slightly problematic in setting up, functional, and the controls accessible and easy to use. Unfortunately, the most important element is to get the thing to function with my computer, and so far that hasn't happened. Too Bad!"
2,Difficult,"The software that comes w/ turntable is not for the average person like me.I still have not figured out how to make CD's from albums, which was the main reason for buying this turntable. I have had this turntable a year now and only use it for listening to albums. I hope the company that makes this turntable finds a user friendly software setup."
3,Customer,"The turntable is well designed, although it could have more output power. When running it through another device such as a mixer you have to turn your amp or receiver up to hear the turntable's output. As for the software that comes with it, everytime I try to record the computer locks up and I can't call the technical support because their hours are 8 to 5 EST. If you live anywhere west of the Eastern Standard Time timezone you are unable to get help unless you skip work to catch them while they are there."
2,turntable,I am having problems with the turntable. I get zero responses out of the unit and will have to return it.MikePlease send return slip.
4,Revelatory,"So far, I'm really happy with this. Fairly straightforward to use (I use Mac), and invaluable for the sound work that I do. After spending years using elaborate set-ups to transfer sound from records to my computer/CDs, it's great to just have this. The sound quality isn't perfect, but then, it wasn't before either. I use it with my stereo and my computer."
3,Great Idea!,"The chance to take my extensive vinyl collection to digital was long awaited. Thank you to the creators of iTTUSB.You forgot to make the turntable ""hearty"" because old vinyl may not be pristine ( scratches, nicks and imperfections ).It skips too easily with no solution. So, I'm back to square one. NIce Try."
5,dw,"I have purchased this identical product at local pharmacys at a much higher price and it is very compforting to know one can get medical supplies that one needs, at a very reasonable price. Very high quality and I reccommend this product to anyone in need of a paper tape."
3,Remember when DVD players (cheap quality ones) were at retail value $200 +,I've owned this dvd player for quite sometime ...late 03' or early 04'?..can't remember but I haven't had a problem w/ it.I actually liked that it supported multiple video formats...i use it at times to double ck unlabled data discs....(i forget to label...argh! i know!)All I can say is that i've had no problem w/ it....but if someone can recommend me to site where i can get a replacement remote?...long story short....my remote melted....Thanks in advance!
1,Wrong photo,"Maybe a good product but this is a failed listing. Actually cube shaped 24"" high, 23.25"" deep and 23.25"" wide. Be aware."
4,An intrigue of a little story,"This little book is a quick magical read. I agree with the reviewer who said, ""It very nearly defies description"". It is unlike anything I've ever read, very original. While having said all this, and yes it was delightful, there were a few things that threw me out of the story. The daughter's storyline somehow didn't ""fit"" with the tale, even the action scenes seemed wrong somehow. And there were just so many unexplained things about Oohlong, and no follow-up. Where do they go from here? It was just a bit too strange for me. But beautiful nonetheless."
1,Crappy Daze,"At least producer Garry Marshall got it right with the Odd Couple. But his ""Happy Days"" was a train wreck of an idea. Dopey episodes that resembled junior high school skits. The only show that rivaled the stupidity of Crappy Daze was Marshall's Mork & Mindy. Good grief, was 70's television awful. I'd rather sit through an infomercial marathon than this crud.Spend your hard earned cash on groceries instead."
3,on with the rest of the seasons,"The first season was the worse season of at least the first four seasons. So lets get on the stick paramount and get the other seasons rolling. I dont think the show really got started till the second season. I did not buy the first season, but i am waiting for the second."
3,The Alltime Greatest Movie Songs,"Some of the songs in The Alltime Greatest Movie Songs are very good, but they're sprinkled in with some not so great. I'm still glad I bought it - because of the good songs."
3,A Weak Early Effort,"This tale of a Hollywood film producer in the 1920s is one of Sanders's slightest novels, lacking the complex plotting and rich characterizations found in his later works. This was a paperback original, originally published several years before Sanders became popular with hard-hitting detective fiction such as ""The First Deadly Sin"" and ""The Anderson Tapes."" The story is enjoyable but never compelling. Both fans of the frothy McNally books and Sanders's darker works such as the ""Sins"" books will most likely be disappointed. True Sanders fans won't want to pass this up, but don't expect too much."
4,Celluloid heroes,"The time is Hollywood, just prior to the arrival of the talkies, when screen heroes and heroines are almost god like creatures to the ordinary audience. Eli Hebron is a talented movie maker who is fighting against the introduction of sound, claiming that it will destroy the purity and integrity of his work. Charlie Royce, a ruthless realist, is determined to take over Magna pictures, Eli's creation, for himself and sees that the majority of people want to be entertained and couldn't give a hoot about Eli's fine dreams. Charlie schemes to introduce Eli to Gladys, a sensuous, beautiful girl, in order to control him through sex and to ultimately bring about his downfall through scandal and blackmail. It's a fascinating look at the very early days of movie making and of the quite scandalous goings on behind the cameras."
2,Had better....,"It definately gave me the full feeling (but taking that many pills, that big will), but for energy it does nothing. I've tried regular and this formula and saw no difference in them..."
5,ABSOLUTELY A MUST-SEE or must read.,"If your heart is open to the truth as it is in Jesus Christ. If you believe the Bible is the inspired Word of God. If you suspect our world is near it's end and the Second Coming of Christ. Then, by all means, GET this video, watch it, and share it!!If you prefer to read, get the book!My thanks to Jim Tetlow and staff for an Amazing production."
4,The breaks were a trip~,"This is a good compilation. Fortier takes you on a journey of trancy soundscapes and melodies. It starts off great, it ends off great too. But like most DJ compilations the middle tracks were weak at times - but that just makes the last ones sound that much better. Definetly worth owning if you like the melodies of trance more than the beats."
3,a story about a drunk who nearly beats a child to death,"I too, was taken in with this book. It became more and more unsettling as we wade through scenes of a neglected and abused little boy who is eventually let down by every adult he trusts. Repeatedly the little boy drinks enough alcohol to render him seriously ill, and the adults in the story add to this by giving him strong drugs to help him sleep. His body is covered with scars, but in the end; the author decides that this child is best left with the man who continually beats him because he REALLY LOVES him. The author couldn't figure out how to work the legal system which would actually award even visitation to a man like this, so in the end she just writes a chapter about the happily ever after.I did enjoy learning a bit about Maori culture, but the overwhelming feeling I get from this book is horror that any one could really believe that a man like this (and a woman like that) had any right to ever get near that child or any child again."
3,Creative writing. Fails to understand/condemn child abuse.,"Very creative stream of conciousness - more pleasing than Joyce. Kerewin is an interesting character and there are many fascinating scenes.However, there seems to be a lack of understanding of child abuse, psychology of the abused and abusers. And a lack of condemnation. One would hope that an author of such talent and creativity as Ms. Hulme would use her talents and power to condemn without sympathy behavior that is condemned by feminists and feeling and responsible men. Even most criminals are intolerant of child abuse."
1,AT LEAST MAKE THEM BELIEVABLE,"I've read numerous books lately where there just doesn't seem to be any editing happening. No matter the illustrious past works of an author, someone should view these unnecessarily long-winded books before they reach the public. Or maybe they figure we want our money's worth, so they'll just leave in all those extraneous words.The story could have been more suspenseful. It just dragged on and on. The main character Alice was the most changeable I've encountered in memory. I never could get a fix on her. One minute she was docile and wimpy, the next assertive and bitchy. Finding your murdered friends might well disconcert a person, but, come on, would their basic nature change every few paragraphs? Life's just too short to spend reading a 300+ page novel when I've seen better made-for-TV movies on Lifetime."
1,"good guitar, bad seller","good guitar but when it got it the guitar didn't have the E-string attached, it was no big deal i had it replaced at a local guitar shop for 80 cents but don't buy it from this site go somewhere else or buy it at a store. i highly recommend this guitar but buy it elsewhere."
5,perfect set,"The price, the service and the shipping were perfect. This adds to our collection and we're so happy to have it."
1,Aint All Dat Good,It Wasent Banging Thay Waz Beter On The Slob Albums then there own A Big Miss Point In Dah Rap Game
4,interesting,"I was initially only familiar with Daho's more recent work - specifically, his wonderful album ""Eden"" - so it's interesting to get the opportunity to hear his music spanning two decades. As you'd expect, his 80s work sounds a little dated, so the compilation as a whole is not compulsive listening. If you enjoy Etienne's music, though, there's plenty here to delight."
4,excellent movie but not in cantonese,"I love this movie. This is as good as Ip Man and better than Ip Man 2. The only minus is that I thought this DVD can play both cantonese and mandarin, but found out that it can only play in mandarin."
4,Sort and Learn Van,"My 21 month old still enjoys this toy. The colors are bright and fun, the songs are fun. It's a little hard to fit the various shapes into its designated spots because of the design of the Van so my son sometimes gets frustrated but with a little help from mama all is well."
1,Truly for dummies,"This book is truly written for dummies. They mention in the book that writers should not ""write down"" to children as if they were stupid. The authors should take their own advice. The whole first chapter discusses things that will be discussed later in the book. Um, how about just get to it? After skimming for a few minutes, I felt discouraged and stupid and used the book as a coaster."
5,"The ""Bible"" on wrirting for the childrens market!","As an author of 2 published books for adults, I thought I knew it all and would have no trouble getting my childrens' book into print. WRONG!!! It's a whole different world and I was NOT prepared to make that leap! But this book was the perfect 'how to' manual and 'road map' for shaping, crafting, writing, publishing and marketing a kids' book in today's highly competitive market.I've got a new children's book in development and will DEFINITELY be using this to get me from basic idea to printed product --- and beyond. The advice on how to SELL books after getting them published is a fantastic added resource the authors include and I'll be referring back to that section again and again. Thanks from a very satisfied customer!"
1,Junk,"Broke first day in use. My problem, I waited 3-4 weeks to install and the side plate broke the first day we shot the rifle. Appears to be more of a pot metal type cast. Will pass on NcStar products going forward"
2,"It's ok for little kids, but not so much for older people.",I gave this a 2 because it was long and boring. Really boring. The story confused the crap out of me and was too long. The story could've been told in way less words.
4,tear da club up thugs,yeah i feel what everybody else is saying this cd is definitly one of there club albums with alot of artist featured but the krunkest song in my opinion is playa why ya hatin
3,THE DIRTY DIRTY SOUTH,They bumping but why do they sound like they all ways have anna on their chest?? They all ways talking about what they gone do to somebody and ain't gone do shit.
5,"If You Don't have It Get It, If You Have'nt Heard It Hear It","I believe that three six mafia is the tightest group out right now. Many people like to hate on them because I'm from Ohio and they say I should be down with Bone.Enough about that I'm here to tell you how tight this cd really is. There are so many smooth cuts on this cd its real hard to tell you what my personal favorite is. If you like RAW lyrics, Hard core beats,and guest appearances from people such as Twista,The Hot Boyz,Crucial Conflict, and many more this cd is for you. I've been a 3-6 fan for a couple years but by far this is my favorite cd they have produced."
3,Mira Sorvino as a drab woman,I was very disappointed in the role Mira Sorvino played as a black haired dental aid dreaming of sexual activity of men and women in a picture in a gallery. I liked her better as a blond sexual symbol.
4,repair manual,"the manual was in perfect conditions and it was sent in a quick manner,that was perfect."
5,A Touch of Troubled Youth,"I picked up this book not knowing quite what to expect and that's exactly what I got, the unexpected.RAGE took me into the mind of a troubled man, who is totally confused by it all. It rushed onto me images, although unsettling, that I could not turn away from.One of the fastest books I have ever read, anyone who wants a story that will keep you intrigued to the end will be satisfied with RAGE.Congratulations to Mr. Gerlach.I will be moving quickly to Lake Mountain."
5,Rage,"It's rare to find an author that makes you immediately want more of their books but that's what happened after I finished Rage. Not for the faint of heart but if you can handle it, I highly recommend this novel. I read it the first eight chapters before bed and the next night I finished the entire novel simply because I could not put it down. If you like a graphic book that holds nothing back then you're in for a real thrill ride."
5,Practical and Insightful,"What is especially useful about this book is that it is practical. It gives advice for every stage of an adjacency expansion, from strategy development to execution, on how to increase the likelihood that it will be successful. The case studies are interesting and the analysis is insightful.For people like me who do not have a business background or management consulting experience, this book is an excellent read and, at the very least, should get you by at parties where you would run into such people."
3,"good, but not worth retail price","I received this toaster for $29.99. For that price I think it is a great toaster, I would not recommend to pay anymore. The toaster works good and is nice to look at, but put together cheaply. I had to do some work on it right out of the box (the crumb trays would not come out). It is a bit slow toasting, but gets the job done."
1,CRIPS,"YOU SLObS ARE FUNNY AS HELL, THIS CD IS WEAK AS FUCC LOCC, 187 ON ALL YOU DEAD FLAG WEARIN HOES CUZZ. LET IT RAIN, LET IT FLOOD, LET A CRIP KILL A bLOOD, LET IT RAIN, LET IT DRIP, bUST A SLOb IN HIS LIp. WE ARE ALL CRIPS IN PITTSBURGH CUZZ, COME C US CUZZ."
4,A Fine book on OO Data Structures But No Java,"A Fine book on OO Data Structures But No Java. It does cover C++ & Smalltalk & Eiffel very well but JAVA became big after this book so no mention is given.A well-written, EXCELLENT BOOK though for C++/SmTk/Eiffel developers who want to view the languages in data-type/ typecasting manner. A superb discussion of OO databases, IDE's & how the OO languages compare.Lack of JAVA may be a draw back for many though.You do need to be TECHNICAL though to read this; I am DW senior technologist working with OO dbs & have 18 years of experience + a CS grad degree. A CS major\grad student or heavy MF systems guy would be my equivalent. Otherwise may be too obtuse. If you got the goods, the book will NOT disappoint."
3,A useful book only if you live in Tokyo or Manhattan,This book contains many stunning photos and presents a lot of intriguing ideas. But it also brings out the final question: If you can afford that much on design why not move to a bigger space? A more appropriate title would be: Decorating Small Spaces in Expensive Cities (where you are too tired to move).
4,Great introduction to branding,"Another reviewer complained about typos (I can't agree based on my edition). My 2 cents that person missed the point. As someone who has been around publishing I can say that all books have typos (like all software has bugs). The point is the content.If you have been a branding-enabled marketing professional for years it is possible that you should try a more technical book. But if you need to get up to speed quickly, refresh your perspective for a new environment or find a way to simply think different, this book is the ticket.The author comes at his topic with a fast paced hard hitting style that gets both fact and perspective out where you can think about it and absorb it without wasting any time. Experience is tough to get in better then real-time, but this book comes close. I found the book more then worthwhile and have suggested it to many, even to friends who are experienced marketing professionals."
2,This title hasn't aged well.,"Tuned Out was one of my favorite books when I was in grade school. A second read from a more adult perspective, however, reveals this to be a very disappointing young adult novel. Unlike S.E. Hinton, who writes WITH her audience and doesn't just preach at them, this author seems very definitely to be talking down to her audience, judgmentally at that. I can't imagine any of the dialogue she created issuing forth from the mouth of an adolescent in ANY era. In addition, while the scenes recounting the hippie pads of Greenwich Village, NYC circa 1968 added a unique flavor to the storytelling, overall the book seems very dated and wholly irrelevant to the faster and more mature pace of life for teens in the new millenium. Not recommended for anything other than nostalgia. ""A Hero Ain't Nothin' But A Sandwich,"" which is still in print although written not much later than this in 1972, is a much better kids-involved-with-drugs tale for teens which still packs a punch today."
1,retarded,"This book was [not good], I seriously think this girl should have resarched the topics she was writing about before trying to go all preachy.Pot. oooo! I was laughing so hard when jim smoked bud for the first time and started seeing angels. What is that about. .... This reminds me of that ridiculous propoganda they used to write about kids smoking bud and getting all psycho, slutting around and such. Outdated nonsense, terrible, terrible."
1,Dissappointing,"Great fan of Cassandra Wilson, especially her wonderful sense of instrumental colour in her arrangements. This, however, (maybe - probably - intentionally) is entirely different. The recording is just SO BAD that I can't really even listen to anything straight through. Hugely dissappointing if played on anything but a car radio (at speed)."
2,J Edgar,This was a pretty dull movie and certainly not worth the $4.95 it cost to rent it. Leo really bombed in this one.
2,boring needs a plot beside homosexualty,"I just about walked out on this film because it was boring. There is no plot. There is a constant theme about homosexuality, but that has no interest to me.I found the acting poor except Clyde Tolson's performance.The filming I thought was goodThe makeup showing aging was poor I thought.My advice, a must miss."
5,Enlightening,"I had heard many rumors over the years about J Edgar and formed an opinion that was very negative. This movie gave a much needed insight to this man. I actually felt sorrow for this guy at the end. He was such an ass but having to live as he did answered a lot of questions on how a someone can turn mean. It is too bad he could not live a more fuller life and the bigotry against his sexuality created an even bigger bigot out of him. He was ruthless at his job. We cannot turn a blind eye to his accomplishments. I think everyone should watch this movie more than once, if you do you will learn something new everytime."
4,Flawless acting!,"Another winner for Clint Eastwood and what impecable acting from everyone especially Dicaprio and Watts. Unlike a few other reviewers (and although I have seen other movies about J. Egar Hoover) the fact there may have been unknowns thrown in as factual events didn't bother me very much because it is not labeled as a documentary. There is no doubt about it, Hoover (like Nixon) was paranoid, arrogant, and vindictive among so many other weaknesses. Let's not forget what a piece of work his mother was. It is a wonder he didn't have more flaws than he did. Hoover (among so many others) is proof that no one is either all bad or all good and he deserves credit where credit is due. Glad we have this movie to add to our collection. If you are a Dicaprio fan, then you will want to see this movie because his portrayal in both appearance and acting was stellar."
3,Great Acting But Lacks Technique,"This movie seems to be a natural choice among the current movies in the movie theatres around where I am. The subject matter of the movie is very well chosen. J. Edgar Hoover is a key person in American history and an interesting one too. Leonardo DiCaprio is giving a good performance in the movie. However, I am not totally delighted with Clint Eastwood's ability as a director, Eastwood appears to be a very emotional director, but he lacks technique. I think Eastwood should team up with a technical whiz-kid for his next movie. And who is the greatest technical whiz-kid in the movie business? Well, without having a too great overview, I would point at Danish director Lars von Trier. So I think Lars von Trier and Clint Eastwood should join forces behind the camera, in a truely cooperative spirit. The result of such a venture could be epic in all respects. But back to the movie, if you are going to the movies now, around where I am, this is a good choice."
2,Dull from beginning to end.,"Historically I am unfamiliar with Hoover, but as a movie watcher, this film was boring. much dialog that could have been scripted better. The plot followed Hoover throughout his life with much emphasis on his homo-sexual tendencies. There were no details however, about Hoover's famous cross dressing. Despite all the big names, it just could not come together and the stories of big Washington D.C. players seem cliche. The life and times of an Oklahoma dirt farmer during this historical period would have been far more entertaining and less contrived than this film."
2,Disappointed,"I have another 24 hours on my AIV rental, so I'll probably watch this again, but...I am disappointed. The constant flip flop between the younger and older J Edgar (complete with Brando-ish stuffing ala Godfather) was visually distracting for me. I'll admit that I don't know a ton about J. Edgar; I'm upset that I don't know any more about him after watching this movie.Shot with lots of subdued tones, I liked one scene where the amber glow through a lampshade added additional color. Later on in the movie when Nixon's inaugural motorcade drives within view of J. Edgar's office window, there is a similar flash of color in the drabness of the scene thanks to the flags."
2,Historically Dull.,"A real sleeper, and I don't mean that in a good way. I nodded off a couple of times. I expected more from Clint Eastwood. What the BLANK(you fill in the blank),was on his mind when he made this movie? I had to ask my wife if it was tomorrow yet. I went and got a sandwich, and this dog was still on when I got back. Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz."
3,Disappointing,"I expected a better movie. The constant bouncing between eras was very distracting and hard to follow at the beginning. It got better as you understood the movie. I expected more G-men action, not the alternative lifestyle of J. Edgar."
1,"This is a ""forbidden love"" romance film, not a FBI thriller.","I was expecting a cross between The Aviator and The Good Shepherd -- a thrilling and epic portrayal of a great man hiding serious psychological issues, as he battles communism or racketeering behind closed doors using methods that often cross moral lines.Instead, it was a documentary about a man suppressing his homosexuality -- the FBI is just a backdrop for this romance, not a focus of the movie.Why would you take America's most controversial bureaucrat and focus on his possible homosexuality instead of his famous actions in office? There are way more interesting homosexual couples to build movies around.This movie is neither a good crime thriller like The Untouchables nor a good romance like Brokeback Mountain -- it's nothing and it will be forgotten."
5,A must-have book for every Christian!,"This book is great for anyone and everyone. It shares, in full detail, a lot of informaion on almost every religion, including cults. This book is as much needed as a dictionary is.""Why So Many Gods?"" gives you the positive and negative side to each religion, their beliefs, and how it compares to Christiaity."
1,Save your money,"This is a biased and poorly written pretense at a comparative presentation of religions---except that some are left out, apparently by being lumped together with the next most similar religion. The text is sprinkled with snide remarks about other religions that leave the reader with no doubt as to where the bias of the author is located. Look for something more balanced, something in which you cannot detect the preference of the author. This is not that book."
3,TIMES OF THE CIVIL WAR,"While the book was satisfactory ,I was severly disapointed in the FREE stuff that was supposed to come with it as per the add. NO where did the add say you would have to download them, We do not have high speed internet available where I live. And if I had known the free offers had to be downloaded I would not have ordered. I have tried several times to get them downloaded and have only succeeded on 2 of the files."
2,Not a Very Good Live Effort,"I like the Bouncing Souls and have purchased their music in the past. I was excited to get a Live CD but very disappointed with this effort. It sounds like they recorded it during a keg party in someone's back-yard. I DJ and could not gleam a single song off this CD to mix into my sets. You really have to listen to find some grains of the sound that makes the Bouncing Souls such an endearing and energetic band. Every band is allowed a dud, and this is theirs."
3,R. L.,"This is a good album and could easily be rated 4 stars songs like ""Off My Cloud"", ""Freedom For The Stallion"", ""Miracle Maker"", and of course the huge hit ""Rock The Boat"" are great songs. I don't know if this album received a lot of airplay back in the early 70s it has a sound of pop and soul similiar to the group The Fifth Dimension, if you are a music collector I highly recommend that you add this one to your collection!"
1,The Valley of the Assisins,"While Freya Stark had an amazing life, the only thing lively in this book is the introduction. The travel descriptions are completely flat, there are no stories beyond the descriptors, and the book does not easily relate the names of places and peoples to present day names, thereby making it harder to relate to. I recommend reading a biography of this phenonemnal woman rather than her travel writings."
3,The Birth House,"I enjoyed this book until about three quarters of the way through...then (imo) the entire ""tone"" of the book changed."
4,Accidental read and worth it,"I came across this book in the ""7 day read"" section of the library and thought it looked interesting. I started it and couldn't put it down.I think at times she through gendered politics to the wind, but that said, it was a damn good read. I've recommended this book to others.I think it's more fiction than _A Midwive's Tale_ and younger readers might enjoy it more."
3,Transistor radios?,"A minor quibble: For a novel set in and about the time of the 1st World War (1914ish), what's with the reference (p. 276 of hardback edition) to transistor radios? The transistor wasn't even invented until about 1947, well after the end of the 2nd World War."
5,Wonderful read for mothers of all ages,This book made me think about the births of my children as well as the very different tales I've heard from my mother and grandmother about giving birth at different times during the 20th century. The author does a great job of weaving in historical events and setting. The characters are well drawn and engaging. Great discussion book.
3,"Decent, but could be better","The first disc is pretty much a throwaway for any U2 fan. All of the songs here are songs that you already have somewhere else. The track selection leaves a little to be desired also (NOTE: The song ""October"" is on this album as a hidden track.) Including ""When Love Comes To Town"" and leaving out other better songs such as ""Running To Stand Still"" or ""Gloria"" is a travesty. These are basically the same songs we have been hearing on the radio for years.The real reason most will buy these discs (myself included) is for the second disc, which is all B-sides and unreleased material. My problem with this disc is that the material is just not that good. Only about 1/3 of them are great songs, the rest being below par songs which would never make one of their albums. This stuff should have stayed in the vault. And the version of ""Party Girl"" on here is terrible."
5,The B sides alone is as good as any other U2 album.,"For die-hard U2 fans, disc one - greatest hits is no big deal because we all have these songs and some are actually not as good as the original releases. On the other hand, disc two - the B sides is phenominal. I have spent years gathering many of these songs in random formats and it is great to have them all in one place with CD quality sound. Trust me, if it weren't for this CD, most people would never have the opportunity to hear Endless Deep, Bass Trap and the original Party Girl. U2 did a great job in selecting these songs from the many other B-sides they have produced over the years. I highly recommend it."
3,"This is a ""Greatest HITS"", not a ""Best Of""","I was psyched to hear that U2 would be putting out a ""Best Of"" disc and not a ""Greatest Hits"". Unfortunately, it is a ""Greatest Hits""...as in, what we've heard on the radio for years, not necessarily their ""best"" songs. Add ""Running to Stand Still"", ""One Tree Hill"", ""Bullet the Blue Sky"", ""Sort of Homecoming"" and ""Promenade"" - DUMP ""When Love Comes to Town"", ""Angel of Harlem"" and the cheesy re-work of ""Sweetest Thing"" and you've got a ""Best of"". The B-Sides are OK, but nothing special if you are a true U2 fan. The Achtung Baby era B-sides are much better - I look forward to the Best of 1990-2000! I still love U2 and hopefully this will pull some latecomers into the fold. sp"
3,a great cd,I love this cd it is totally cool.Now I have all of my favorit songs on 1 cd. I think all u2 fans should own it. And If you like u2 try Deleriou5 ***** it is five stars.
3,"Great Music, but an incomplete collection","Should have been 5 stars and easily another CD worth of tunes, but they left too much out. What about Twilight from the first record, Gloria and Fire from October for starters. In addition, the song A Celebration should have been included on the A sides. I have all the U2 stuff, including the b-sides, so I won't be buying this CD. Too bad they didn't offer something to entice a hard-core fan with some stuff I couldn't get anywhere else."
5,A phenomenal collection of hits and lesser-known releases,"The Best of 1980-1990 limited edition is a great collection. Not only do true U2 fans who already have most or all of their previous releases get the top songs on one CD, they also get incredible B-sides such as ""Spanish Eyes,"" ""Bass Trap,"" ""Love Comes Tumbling,"" and ""Three Sunrises."" This is a must-get for any diehard U2 fan who may not have previously heard some of the great B-sides. A must buy!"
4,"Perfect for the Casual listener, Complimentary for the Fan","If you are a casual listener and have only ever owned two U2 CDs, (The Joshua Tree and Achtung Baby) then this CD is for you. The first CD is most of their best hits from the 80s. Obviously their are some tracks I would rather have seen from Boy, War, Unforgettable Fire and The Joshua Tree. For the fan, the first CD should be nothing new. Although parts of the second CD are readily available through past singles and EPs, it is a good collection."
2,Didn't like,"The were not good, I buy them in the store and they are really good and i only pay 5.95 I was surprise that the same item was 12.95 I through it was for a bigger size. The chocolate was melted....I won't buy any more from that company."
1,Does not taste like pumpkin spice!,"My son pegged it - ""It tastes like butternut squash!"" Ewwwww. Not up to the quality of other Torani flavors."
1,Ick,"What a disappointment. I had high hopes for this syrup since I live the Dunkin Donuts and Starbucks lattes. However this is nothing like this. For the reviewers who claim that it was similar to these products, I have no idea what else they added. I tried it with extra sugar, with honey, with whipped cream, extra pumpkin pie spices. Yet nope, still tastes like butternut squash. Really gross. I'm pretty miserly but just poured the whole bottle down the sink."
1,Don't buy,"This is false advertising. It is one overpriced bottle, not a case as described in the listing. Don't buy it"
5,BOOK LOVER BOOK SAVER,For me the best way to purchase necessary textbooks for high school or college. Fast and safe way to aid the student in your household.
4,not as humorous as I had expected,"I saw a blurb about this book in a genealogy newsletter I receive. Since I've already discovered the variety of grave stone ""styles"" and various ways cemeteries are arranged, I got the book.While there are some humorous bits, it's mostly a serious look at ""the New American Way of Death"" - sensitively written - some of the parts which could well have been mined for humor were treated respectfully by the author.That said, it is an excellent book - 5 stars for content - I gave it only 4 just because it wasn't as humorous as I was expecting."
3,Tool box,the front panel was not spot welded to the bottom of the box. this allows items to fall out. I will have to drill hole and add small sheet metal screws or pop rivets to repair. either bad design or poor quality.
4,Excellent resource,This was an excellent way for my son to review his shapes and keep his attention which at 3 is sometimes hard to do. I was also thrilled when my 14 month old daughter also started learning to say the names of the shapes!
5,Great for toddler,My son who is 15 months loved this dvd. He was able to identify the different shapes after having seen it just 3 o 4 times.
5,My kids love this movie,"Both my 9 month old and 2 year old love this movie. While I find it slightly annoying, my kids love it. My 2 year old knew most of his shapes, but learned octagon and diamond within a week of watching this. It's one of his favorite movies. He asks to watch it all of the time."
2,Largely Useless,"If you want phrases to use for picking up Syrian women, you will find lots of practice phrases. If you are a traveler and want to know where the bathroom is, how much does this cost?, do you have a room with bath? you're out of luck."
2,Basically worthless,"Because this does not include written instructions, there is no alphabet learning involved and therefore you are unable to learn to read and write the language. You basically learn to repeat certain phrases like a parrot. That is not what learning a language is all about. This is a program for the lazy."
1,i didnt get the packet yet,plz do smth .. i have not yet received the packet ... its been too long...
3,Mislead!,"I thought I was going to recieve the cake figurine,the wand and crown. I only recieved the crown and wand. The internet page is misleading. It shows the whole image. It does not specify anywhere what it actually comes with. It only states ""Princess Cake Toppers"" and shows the image of cake,crown and wand. I'm very unhappy you should have specificed (for example: cake figuine not included). This was for my first niece in the family who will be celebrating her first birthday and coming in from out of town and I will be meeting for the first time. I'm so disappointed."
1,Robert B. Parker Companion,"The somewhat sloppy copy editing gives me pause, as well. Here's an example, on pg 69 we find: ""Cooper, Bob. (Bad Business) The CEO of Kinergy..."" Then, on pg 70 an entry reads: ""Cooper, Wilma. (Bad Business) Wife of Ben Cooper...""Trivial error? Sure... Ben, Bob, what difference does it make? But what other trivial errors are in the book that I didn't catch? Then too, it occurs to me that for the U$14 cover price, I shouldn't have to do Berkeley Publishing's job for them.And don't you dare call me ""Bob!"""
2,robert parker companion,"A typical companion book, just synopsis of his books, a little bio on Parker. An ok book if you want to use if for a reference."
4,marine ski mirror,"Recently purchased the CIPA 0200 COMP mirror. Great choice, this is simple to install and works great. The large7 X 14 mirror is perfect. You can find your skier or boarder no matter how hard they cut out.My only improvement recommendation would be a way to mount the mirror further out in front of the driver.Current mount requires a lot of head/neck movemnet up and down."
1,One Long Ferrari Commercial,"This could have been so much better. Yes, the cover shot is gorgeous and yes, there is a bit of great scenery along the canals of Venice, but don't be mislead, this begins and ends as a Ferrari promotional. The best part for me was the story of the fishermen-the shots of them making the big catch is quite a site, but the rest of this dvd left much to be desired. Linda Hunt's narration is good."
1,Yuck!,"Parents, I am just an 11-year-old little girl, who knows what she's talking about. Why would you buy this ""Lil Dancer"" for your little girls? What do you want to teach them? That dressing like a girl who sneaks out of the house at night to go to a bad party is okay, and taht it's okay to look like a hooker? Sorry, this is just a really bad doll. I obey what God says, and He says that this isn't appropriate. Thanks.-disgusted horse-crazy"
3,"Entertaining, but a little far-fetched","If you want an accurate and beleivable description of the Hundred Days Campaign, you should probably look elsewhere. However, if you want to just turn off your brain, check reality at the door and just be entertained then this book should do the trick. It is standard Cornwell, full of visual and emotional drama, but a bit far fetched. Although I was entertained, I am troubled by some of Cornwell's claims and accusations about how the battle was conducted. Please do not mistake this book as history, and accept it for what it is, a good fictional novel."
2,This didn't fit me!,"My head is 22.5"" in circumference. This helmet that was supposed to fit up to a 23.5"" didn't. Lies and also lies.Does look good though, when not on my head that is. For that, two stars."
4,A Very Great Book,"The main characters are Bindi, a girl and Tiki fairy. The problem is the fairy queen. The setting is in spring time. It tells a story about a a fairy named Tiki. Tiki and Bendi are girls. Once in the story Bindi stole a candy bar and cloned it into may candy bars and toys. Toys were falling out the window and froze half way down. I would say read Fairy Reble. It is a fascinating book a fairy and a girl."
5,I remember reading this one,"I loved this one as a girl! I appreciate the fact that Dahl doesn't coddle his child readers and that scary things happen in the book.I only wish it were still running with the earlier illustrations. I am very fond of Quentin Blake, but the first paperback version, which I still own, has more detailed illustrations and more uniquely drawn characters."
4,"1870 UNITED STATES CENSUS OF PUTNAM COUNTY, TENNESSEE","This is a transcription of the 1870 Putnam Co, TN census. It contains information any true researcher of Putnam County would want. There is a map of the Civil Districts 1st - 16th and excerpted entries from the Census. Information included is Dwelling number, Family number, Last Name, First Name & Middle Initial, age, sex, color, profession or trade, value of real estate, value of personal proberty and birth state. It is indexed and easy to use. I'd recommend it to anyone doing serious genealogical research in Putnam County."
4,"""Ignite My Fire I Want To Burn For You","This project is GOOD!William Murphy has the soothing sound, Everytime I hear ""Praise Is What I Do"" it just makes me worship the Lord,My favorite Worship Songs are ""Healing Worship"" ""Created To Worship & ""Ignite My Fire""I would like to hear more praise Songs, but my favorites are ""Awesome"" and ""Good"""
1,"Good book 1, but series was awful","Even though I liked this book and it had great promise, you can read my other reviews on the next two if you like. Bok two was worthless and not needed, and book three started good again, but had a terrible ending. I don't usually say this but I wish I hadn't read this series."
1,"Misleading title, poorly written",A great chunk of this book is about the origin and disappearance of the Neanderthal. The entire book is poorly written and disorganized.Avoid.
5,STRESS FREE GRILLING,"This book makes it so easy to follow the directions. I got two copies, one for each of my sons. They are enjoying the simple and tasty recipes."
2,not worth the $$,"The chain was nice and of good quality. Unfortunately, the hook/latch was not and was not securely attached to the chain. The loop broke within the 1st week of light usage. To be fair, I did not try and contact the company to get it repaired or to return it, so I am unfamiliar with their return policy and how they would have handled this situation."
2,icarly jumped the shark,"This show used to be really good in its first two seasons, but it has tanked in quality since then and it has become clear that the main characters have outgrown the premise of the show. Centering the show around Sam would be an improvement but its quite clear that Big Time Rush is the best show on Nick."
5,Buy it just for the Cosmos mix!,"The original mix is ok, but Tom Middleton can turn just about any pop tune into a tech-house anthem! Epic & beautiful. You go boy!"
3,"Good, but High Noon by Rischard is Better","This is a good book. If E.O. Wilson had not published ""The Future of Life"" or J. F. Rischard ""High Noon: 20 Global Problems, 20 Years to Solve them"", or Brian Czech, ""Shoveling Fuel for a Runaway Train,"" then this would be a great book. The book could not have a more distinguished author or more erudite arguments--it suffers from a boring presentation, including an unreadable choice of colors by the publishers for the back cover.If this is an area of professional interest, the book is absolutely essential. If this is an area of personal interst, and you can afford five books, this book definitely deserves to be in that number. If you can only afford one or two books, buy ""High Noon"", followed by ""Future of Life""."
5,Radical Equations: Math Literacy and Civil Rights,"The voices from Mississippi in the 60's and again in the 80's, 90's and on into this new century come right off the page in this tremendously important book. Bob Moses and Charles Cobb ground the reader in the earlier civil rights movement, laying the foundation for the current struggle for citizenship of minority youth-which plays out now in terms of competing in today's job market. They discuss their approach and demands (of themselves, of the kids, of the parents and teachers, of the community) in terms of ""setting the floor."" The authors show that we as a society need to leave behind the expectations that these youth can't make it and give them the tools so they can advance. The quality of the writing makes the concepts very accessible and the message is one of great hope. I've already thought of 10 different people who should read this book ASAP!"
1,Horrible and cheap.,There is a reason this is so cheap. All the seams ripped as I was putting it on and zipping it...It is barely sewn together.
1,"False Advertising, Awful Product - DO NOT BUY!!!","This thing is TOTAL GARBAGE!. Do ***NOT*** buy it! I paid $99 for it, which is $99 too much.First off: The alleged manufacturer's web page (CablesToGo; really an anonymous Taiwan OEM) said it would do 1600 x 1200 - total lie; max. is 1280 x 1024.Second: at its highest res, 1280 x 1024, the display locks up after only several minutes. Disabling it and re-enabling gets it working again, but who the devil is going to do that every 4 minutes?Third: yes, that video display lags immensely. I'm writing code, so fast screen update is not needed, so I could live with this. IF it did the res. advertised; IF it actually worked for more than 4 minutes at a stretch.I'll be sending mine back for a 100% refund, I HOPE. This thing is A TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY!"
2,not very useful,"Not very useful manual. They go into detailed desription of obvious things.Also, into great detailes of how to take appart (for example) gear box, that you shall never have to take appart, but they skip esential information on things that are important, but not so obvious."
4,Good but not Great,"So far, I have been very pleased with all of the Recluce novels I have read, namely the first four. Modesitt's weakness is that he often starts his books with the exact same plot device--a young man on Recluce is for some reason forced to go to Candar and there becomes a very powerful wizard and turns the world on its head, all the while winning the girl of his dreams. However, not every detail is replicated and Modesitt could easily be described as doing a ""Theme and Variation"" approach to this saga. This series isn't as on grand a scale as say Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time series or Terry Goodkind's Sword of Truth series, but in many ways that makes it better--there are significantly less details to remember, so you don't spend each new book trying to recall what happened in the last one. In the end, it shouldn't be compared to either of the aforementioned series because it isn't as good. But, it still is a good read and a very enjoyable tale."
3,Basically more of the same,"While this book is an excellent example of Mr. Modesitt's ability to create the ""world"" of Recluce by lavish convincing detail, it has the major drawback of having practically the same plot as ""The Magic of Recluce"" and ""The Magic Engineer"". I bought it in paperback and don't consider the money wasted but I would have been irritated if I'd paid the hardback price."
1,Gunman's Goal,"Reprint of THREE ON THE TRAIL, if you already have that book, this edition has about three more pages."
1,Steer clear of this junk,Half-baked product. Three out of five different disks I've tried turned out to be incompatible with this sucker. One of the worst thermal management designs I've ever seen. It even managed to bake one of the test disks due to severe overheating. I would never entrust my data to this junk.
4,Good book!Like the romance and the characters.,I really liked Sage's character and how she deals with her father and what happened in her childhood and Deanne tries to deny her feelings for Sage and the romance between these two women.I also bought this book b/c it deals with Sage being Native American but I wish there were books out there for lesbian Blackfoots.I am planning on getting Never Ending(the sequel to Legacy of Love).
1,great fire starter,Buy it if you have insomnia or want to start up the wood stove. I paid .25 cents at a used book store and that was a waste of money.
3,my daughter loves it...,My 8 yr old is a Bratz fan...this doll was on her Christmas wish list.I think the cords that connect the doll to the karaoke machine should be a bit longer...the doll and karaoke machine always topples over when my daughter gets into the whole singing bit.
5,These Guys Are The Real Thing,"This is as good a surf band as there ever was, right here in our midst. The musicianship is impeccable, and they are charismatic performers with a genuine love and respect for the genre. They bring an original touch and a lot of wit to their music without any sign of the ever-present Gen-X smirk. In this show they have the guts to play a lot of dark and mid-tempo stuff like ""Endless Sleep"", which is genuinely scary (check it out!). They bring an original touch to the covers- ""Dick Tracy"" is a masterpiece- and the original stuff is every bit as good. The cheerful ""Surfin' Tragedy"" is a huge favorite with me.Guys, if you're still out there- give us another one!"
3,Broke... but fixed... and fast.,"I just bought one of these cement shears. It worked great... but one of the side knives broke within the first half hour of use. I was giving it very light usage, cutting 1/4 inch HardieBacker. I was very disappointed because the whole house is torn up and the job is stuck intil I get a new tool. I explained this to the DeWalt Warranty people on their toll free line. They had a new side knife here in less than 24 hours. Obviously there was a defect... and they fixed it fast. Thanks DeWalt."
3,BEWARE NEW EDITOR 2005,"The first issue under the guidance of its new editorial staff showed what the PBK board must have had in mind. The magazine has adopted now a current-events bent, in place of the more insulated material that many found so appealing before. Photos are now part of the format- not good photos, or color photos, or anything like that, just waste-of-space photos. Oh yeah, in a nutshell, the pen is gone from the cover. The changes bring a once-great journal down to a level of mediocrity that results from trying to compete in a game that is not their own. I will not be renewing."
1,The End of a Good Thing,I had subscribed to the American Scholar for many years for the fine essays. I've let my subscription lapse now that the new editors have dumbed the magazine down. I can't imagine who they're trying to appeal to. The current issue's recourse to Kitty Kelly was the straw that broke the camel's back.
1,"Evangelism, or door-to-door sales pitch?","As I write this, I'm looking over the chapter titles for this book. ""Have a Definite Time to Go."" ""Be Soul-Conscious."" ""Be Clean and Neat."" ""Go Two By Two."" ""Be Complimentary."" And so on.So where, pray tell, is the *content* of the message? Well, chapters 21-24 are: ""Show Him that He is a Sinner""; ""Show Him the Price on Sin""; ""Show Him that Jesus Paid the Price."" That, and a few Bible references. Heck, the chapter titles are longer than the chapter contents! Hyles spends more time telling the reader not to smell bad (duh!) than he does explaining what, exactly, the Gospel is.This raises the question: What's being preached here? Christ and him crucified? Or Jack Hyles' Handy-Dandy Handbook for Selling Salvation?"
1,Flawed,"This soul winning maual is not going to help you fulfill the Great Commission.You need to do more than just go and talk someone into making a profession of faith, we are to make disciples, not converts.This book focuses on making converts and nothing more, gives the impression of making salvation a ""sell"" and is reminicent of door to door salesmen.Find a new way."
4,Textbook Purchase,"Order arrived in condition expected, turn around time was good and a packing slip was included with the package - this is very important for school purchases. The only thing that would have helped is to have the order number on the packing slip."
4,The Pages with Craving/Needs is worth the price of the book,What got me to buy this book was a teacher who used it - in the back it has a list of craving foods and what it represents as far as emotional needs unmet. That list is worth the price of the book.
4,COVERS QUITE A BIT,"Wonderful compilation of the male Jackson musicians, though it makes me wonder why they left out tracks from VICTORY and the ""2300 Jackson Street"" song featuring Michael from 1989. Nonetheless, it covers all the Jackson 5 hits, the hits that started Michael out on his own (from ""Got to be There"" to the groundbreaking ""Billie Jean""), the top Jacksons hits from 1976-80, and Jermaine's biggest hit ""Let's Get Serious"" from 1980. ""Daddy's Home"", Jermaine's song from 1973, is surprisingly missing. Worth the purchase, and especially worth it if you're a fan."
4,Excellent book,"People spend their entire lifetimes working to amass wealth, but forget about protecting it. I bump into people every day who still think a will is enough---ENT! I also recommend Financial Self Defense and More Wealth without Risk by Givens. Suze's book is newer, but Givens offers techniques that work well with the information in this book."
1,The math is wrong,"The time value of money analysis in this book does not take into account that money has time value and thus the results of the studies Orman presents are biased in the wrong direction. Also the rate of inflation of 5% is too high based on current and past values. This also biases the results. It is funny to see the results of her long term care insurance policy analysis. According to Orman, the insured pays in $1,255 each year for 30 years and alternately if they had not taked the policy get no credit for the compound growth rate this money would earn had not they taken the policy. It makes a huge different that was not considered Also there is a chart that shows a comparison of 5% simple and compound interest on an inflation rider. Certainly, inflation is not a simple interest growth rate. The data of Orman's table make no sense whatsoever and certainly have no bearing on the long term care policy decision."
1,You earned it; Don't lose it,The book was written too long ago to be of much use in this century. It needs to be updated or scrapped. It is behind the times and makes some of the information useless if not incorrect. A better choice can be found.
1,Not recommended,1)This charger displays a red light so faint as to be visible only in thedark to indicate when it is charging batteries. The light does notgo out or change color if/when the batteries are charged. The unit includesno instructions to explain the charging time or indicator light meaning.2)My packaged unit did not include the advertised vehicle plug. 3)One of myunit's four included 2700 MAH batteries does not hold a charge.
2,Cute but that's about it,"These don't fit well inside of the cupcake pan. Once you start filling the cups with batter the sides ""buckle"" over. Also, once the batter is in the cup the paper looks greasy and you can't see how cute the patter is."
1,Can't get refund for wrong book!!!,"I am not a happy customer and I'll NEVER order from Amazon again... I needed essentials of human anatomy and physiology ninth addition and was send the seventh addition. When I emailed to see about returning for a refund. They told me they already spent the money I sent for the book... and told me I would have to try and sell it myself. ""NOT GOOD BUSINESS"" I am on a fixed income trying to go to college... Sorry but I don't think this person has treated me fairly...No refund policy on a book thats way out of date....If you are buying from this person I would suggest you make sure you are getting what you ask for before you order."
5,Campy but funny stuff,"I am a John Astin fan (The Addams family), and heard about this movie only recently. Its worth seeing at least a couple of times. In its day it was probably funnier than now. For the diehard Astin fan."
5,An Elementary School Classroom Classic,"I remember watching this film on the old reel to reel projectors 40 years ago in elementary school. Each year,as students, we all gathered in the school gym to watch this story. From my standpoint it seems like a simple classic short film from a simpler time when special effects and graphics were not the focus, but rather the story of the boy and his travels of his carved wooden boat. I would hope today's school children would accept this film as a classic and anticipate watching from year to year. ""Paddle to the Sea"" brings back a more innocent time when technolgy and ""all the hustle and bustle"" was not America's focal point. I really wish-and hope-that this film could be viewed by all of our elementary children!"
1,Digital Copy expired!,Great movie on Blue-Ray but the digital copy is expired as of 1/1/11. Very disappointed in this. I wanted to place a copy of this movie on my ipad and now I only have the Blue-ray. Still a great flick at a good price though.
5,One my new favorite films of all time.,"I loved this film. I have watched it several times since owning it. Some would disagree, but with any Quentin film, he is making what he thinks is great, and if you are on that wavelength, you're right there with him. I am an action lover and even the lack of anticipated action did very little to quash my love of this film. The characters and the tension in this movie where just too great.As for this product, the soundtrack wasn't all that great. While Q's music choices are genius in the context of the film, they rarely hold up when played alone. It's hard to listen to a scratchy 1940's song, then follow that up with an 80's David Bowie song."
4,Popcorn Eater,Make extra popcorn if you are going to watch this movie. You want have time to get up and pop more.
1,I want these 2 hrs of my life back,"Dumb, unrealistic and mindless.Few good actors cannot fix this movie.I am sure some people would really believe that the world war ii ended because of some brave American soldiers who killed the top 4 Germans... not."
4,"Very Good Video Quality, Great Audio Quality","Please describe the audio and video quality of any Blu-Ray you review. Thanks to those who do this.The video quality was very good, but I didn't see it as great. I thought the video was soft. I had my TV set to ""Vivid"", and it still did not look great. There wasn't any grain, but it just did not look sharp.The DTS-HD 5.1 Master Audio was great - lot's of surround sound.I thought the movie was pretty good. It looked like it was 2.40:1, and lasted about 2 hours and thirty minutes. There were a lot of sub-titles, and it did not give me enough time to read some of them. I just don't like having to read the words; it distracts from the movie."
4,"Good movie, of course, by Tarantino!!","got this for $6.99 from Target after using $3.00 coupon by Universal 100th special.great blind buy for sure, don't care about digital copy at all!! don't even watch movies in my laptopbecause not worth it, really!! Bluray or DVD will suffice, enough said!! :)all Hail Tarantino's superb work!!=)"
1,Loser...start to finish,"No-one sane will ever understand why Hollywood insists on continuing to make movies that are downright insulting, ludicrous and unentertaining....could it be the mentality of the viewing public? Evidently, Tarantino has the same ""tongue in cheek"" disregard because inglorious basterds has to pertain to the paying audience and not to the storyline. Ten minutes into this movie you'll wonder where it's going and why. At the end you still won't know. My minor grandchild could make a better movie. But, Tarantino, with the IQ of a fence post, is laughing all the way to the bank having fooled his fawning public, again. And you, will have wasted 2 1/2 hours of your life which you'll never get back...."
1,What a retarded plot,"Oh Oh Oh, How could I have been so foolish as to purchase this junk. The plot is a complete fantasy of a retarded mind. If you like butchery, lots of blood and gore intended for humor, if you think seeing someone cut open using highly focused graphics for realism is fun, if you would like to see a ridiculous, contemptible depiction of a sensitive time in history made solely for the purpouse of entertainment and making money, then this film is degenerate enough for you. In fact, let me know and I will mail you my copy......otherwise in the dumpster it goes and good riddance. Brad Pit, how low will you go for a dollar."
2,Pitt is a joke with his western accent,Brad Pitt is a real joke as a western accsented officer. I know that this wasbased on history but come on he sounds awful
5,How can you not like this movie?,This movie was just flat out entertaining as hell and totally unforgettable. That Waltz guy was crazy good in this movie. Sure it could have used a little more action and was dialogue heavy in parts but good all around. Great acting and totally kept my attention for the full 153 min run time.Make sure you have the stomach for heavy violence before you pop this one in... but otherwise this one should not be missed.
3,Action packed ..,Was action packed but the plot was not that great likeHitler gettinmg bown up at a movie where you hardly had any security for the guy..and things like that..
2,Way Over Hyped,"Frankly it is just boring. There are a couple of clever scenes, but they are not worth slogging thru the whole mess. I finally gave up and turned it off when they started speaking Italian. I'm sure the ending was spectacular, but I couldn't stick it out that long."
4,Those Basterds!!!,"Great dialogue, not much action and not as violent as people said it was. What you are getting here is a really good story."
1,Terrible,I can't believe I really wanted to see this or wasted money on it. It has no redeeming qualities at all. Terrible acting and what could have been a good action film ruined.
4,Would not play on my Phillips Blu-Ray bdp7200,"The movie was great but, my Blu-Ray player would play everything on the disk except the movie. I updated the firmware on the player and it still wouldn't play.From from what I read on the internet no movies by universal will play on this Blu-Ray player because Phillips won't update the firmware."
2,More gratitutious violence,"I believe every act of goodness and kindness will have a positive effect somewhere sometime, although the persons committing the act may never see the results of their actions. And the same is true for mean and evil actions, they amplify negativity in the world.""How can it be that watching two and a half hours of violence in a movie will have no influence on our behavior but a 30 second Super Bowl ad is worth 3.8 million dollars because it will make us run out and buy a product?""And on top of that Brad Pitt, who I generally enjoy as an actor, could not pull off the good old boy role at all!I would have given this movie a single star, but I watched this whole movie to see if there was going to be any redeeming value at the end. There was none. It only serves to increase the sum total of evil in the world. Don't waste your time."
5,Movie time,"I ordered this movie last year and have watched it several times. To me,it is a great movie. I ordered the movie again from ""Amazon"" to give to my sister and her husband. They had never seen it and now like it as much as I do. I would rate it 5 stars without question.Brad Pitt is one of the best actors around today. In this movie,he was outstanding."
2,"For fans for Tarantino and fans of ""shoot em ups"".","You ever notice how almost all of Tarantino's scenes end with violence, the threat of violence, or with someone dying? Im no psychologist but I am very observant, Its as if he is trying to kill some part of his subconscious off or maybe its symptomatic of his inability to see the world in a mature adult way. Instead what we the viewers get is a black or white, no subtext, no gray area, incomplete character motivations. I also felt this movie ran longer tahan necessary (Tarantino is getting more hedonistic and excessive as he goes along, no?). There are however several really good scenes (more in way of acting and directing) in this film but mostly I would just rather watch the movies this movie borrowed from and are superior to. WW2 films like Dirty Dozen, A bridge to Far, Kelly's Heroes, A Bridge over the River Kwai, Patton, Tora! Tora! Tora! Well, you get it..."
3,"Sex, sadism and some historic data","Eventually, this next Holocaust-related vaudeville is the latest attempt to professionally contribute a tragic topic visualisation by an ""eatable"" way attracting contemporary viewers with murdering, gore, blood mixed with sex, sadism and some historic data.Performing is starling, characters are clever, educated, and professional and worth each other enemies, Brad Pitt is sexy even in moms and baggy camouflage, Hitler looks the most realistic than in any other movie a reviewer had seen, a clone from ""Adolf & Eva"" surely - and something anyway in the air not allowing to top-mark this work. Probably, it is an unnecessary exaggeration of producer's own delusions of both history recorded and glorifying the unspeakable to an extent of heroic."
2,Not what I thought it would be,"I realize, given the director, that this would be a violent movie. I was disappointed that it came out in a comic book-like direction. Brad Pitt was more of a distraction. His accent was laughable and, that squint, looked as though he were trying to channel Popeye.The dividing of the film into ""chapters,"" made one wonder if the director were trying to bypass a more smooth transition of the story.Glad that I only rented this movie - only out $2.50."
3,"Pushing the limits, but doesn't pay off","Inglorious Bastards does a lot right. The scene work, character, and dialog are all top notch. The main problem is that there are at least 3 distinct stories being told, all loosely tied together that don't come together in any meaningful way."
1,Boringgggggggggggggggggggggg,What a boring frickin movie. I wish I never bought it. Blu-Ray quality is excellent but the movie itself sucks.
1,terrible,I regret seeing this movie. This movie is terrible and disgusting. they made Jewish-American soldiers just as evil as real Nazis. Shame on you Quentin Tarantino!
1,Not really a movie...,"Not so much a movie, more of something for film students to do reports on. It's so slow! When are people going to realise if you put in subtitles, don't put light colored writing over light colors so people can't read them! I don't mind subtitles myself, I love asian films. When you put in English subtitles, shouldn't you put all the subtitles in English? Most of them are in English, but some are in German (when the character is speaking German) or French(when the character is speaking French). Pointless, just like this flick."
1,Another pointless movie by Quentin Tarantino,"I don't get the message of this movie. It is disgusting and pointless. Yes, war itself is disgusting and ugly, but this movie is an insult to all our brave men who fought against the Nazis. Whoever read To Hell and Back by Audie Murphy got an idea what WWII looked like. Our soldiers were not what this movie makes them!!"
1,Gore Glorfied - No Heroes,"This story is pure fantasy. With all the touching true stories to come out of World War II, why does a movie producer sink to such a level to supply entertainment? It seems to have been made simply to exploit Hollywood's talent for exhibiting gore. There are no heroes or ""good guys"" here. I honestly can't find any redeeming value about this picture. With movie themes like this dumped on our public, criminals have a generous supply of role models to imitate. Wish I could get my money back.This movie is not worth one star but Amazon doesen't allow a zero rating, so....one star it is!"
1,Product of an inglorious mind,"One star in one star too many for this sick product of a sick mind of what is becoming a sick industry in Hollywood. I could go up the ladder, but I'll stop here for the purpose of this review. In fact there's nothing to review. This movie amounts to nothing, artistically or in any other way. It is a revenge fantasy that comes 65 years too late, so I am at a loss to find the motivation behind this movie. I feel sorry for those young minds who are exposed to this garbage and even more so to see some expressing appreciation. Just glad I live in a different country and a different culture."
2,Too Strange,This movie starts out good and quickly becomes boring and depressing. I think they didn't know how to end it. Save your money.
2,Lame,"Yes, there is classic Tarantino-style dialog and the movie is well put together, but the plot is silly and, unfortunately, Tarantino's protaganists are sadistic psychopaths whose behavior leads on at least two occasions in the film to root for the Nazis! You have to come up with some pretty reprehensible characters to get your audience to pull for the ultimate evil-doers. I realize this is a fantasy movie set in WWII, but it is so absurd it makes most sci-fi films seem plausible. Also, I'm not generally very sensitive or easily offended, but maybe this setting and plot should have been avoided. The Nazis and WWII brought incomprehensible suffering on those who lived through it and especially fought in it. Though I don't think this movie is necessarily an affront to our veterans and the victims of the war, it just doesn't do any service to them at all and is at least a little bit offensive in handling the topic matter and setting."
2,moral holy wood crusade,"A movie like a glossy magazine , we should know that's only about gossip , but some out there take it for real .I guess this movie was supposed to be a satire but at the same time somebody tried to take things seriously .Like being a little bit pregnant . The dialogs in german language sounded like dutchmen are trying to speak german , really awful . I mean , if you're spending that much money on actors , at least you could try to keep things real ."
4,Better than buying Boot leg illegal copies,"I go into a lot of places where you have people coming in and seling bootleg copies of movies for about $5. You know when you buy these items you are doing an injustice to yourself, and are actually comitting a crime, but more than that you take away monies from people who worked to create the product and that just isn't right... SO DONT' BUY BOOTLEG COPIES, let the people who work to create movies get paid for thier work."
2,just an ugly film,"Brad Pitt really slaughters his role badly as theofficer in charge of the ""Inglourious Basterds""Jewish OSS hit team of terrorists.The action has some of the worst violencescenes outside of a horror movie,with scalpings and a fellow beat to death on camerawith a baseball bat.The idea is that killing all the German high command would haveended the war early, and the movie is a sort of Jewish fantasyabout killing Nazis.I found myself wondering that such a filmwhich is at best a B-filmgot mass marketing?"
4,Revenge and Justice aptly portrayed,"Quentin Tarantino isn't high on my list of directors. I've always had a difficult time watching most of his films, losing myself somewhere in the gore and inaneness.Inglourious Basterds changed my perception of Tarantino as a director. I found the movie visually appealing and the story line believable. The Basterds brought to mind The Dirty Dozen on steroids with severe anger management issues but,as we all know, war is ugly.Tarantino film displays this ugliness with a talented ease that was both graphic and detailed. Pitt portrayal of LT. Aldo Raine, with his snide and cutting commentaries and his basic he** with the rules theories, is excellent. Christopher Waltz as Col. Hans Landa made my skin crawl from his first appearance, stealthy and as cunning as a snake, all while he mentally examines his victims for weak spots.All and all, if you can handle the gore, this is a fantastic movie that will keep you on the edge of your seat."
5,One of my top movies,"I love everything about this movie. The drama, the humour, the fantasy, the bi and trilingual actors, everything. This is Quentin Tarantino's fantasy of how WWII would have gone down. It's not historically accurate in the slightest, but it sure is fun! Tarantino is such an enthusiastic director and gets so involved with his incredulous movies. I happen to appreciate that, but I know Tarantino's style isn't for everyone.This movie was fantastically done and Cristoph Waltz deserved the Oscar he won for his performance. I would recommend this film to anyone who likes to be genuinely entertained and doesn't mind a little gore. For some who is not familiar with Quentin Tarantino's work, I think this serves as a great introduction to his style."
5,Great 80's CD,"I have been looking for this CD for around 15 years. I owned this tape back in '85 I believe and I Thought and still think that it is one of the best ""hard-Glamour"" rock albums of the time. It has hard hitting drums and hard guitar rifts, ahead of it's time. Greg Giuffria and his very 80's voice sets the music off just right. All and all one of the best albums I had ever owned back in the 80's, almost as impressive as my best 80's band Stryper."
1,Nothing New!,"I tried to find some puzzles to use for team building that could not be found on the internet via search engines...boy was I disappointed. I input the first couple of words from the first puzzle, imagine my suprise to find the whole book scanned into google book search, every page, every solution.....Highly disappointed."
2,Not too impressed,I was excited to get this book as a gift but found that most of the puzzles have already been seen in other books that I used. There were a few new ones but probably not enough to justify buying it.
2,Not very good the second time around,I thought volume one was a great book a definate must have. The second volume is terribly boring and unorganized. You can really tell they hurried through volume 2. Maybe the 1.2 version will be better?
5,¡¡¡Es un libro excelente!!!,Considero que este es uno de los mejores libros en programación que he leido. Este libro debería ser considerado por aquellos desarrolladores que se consideren serios y profesionales.El único requisito que piden los autores es que los programadores cuenten con tan solo un poco de lógica y ganas de entender Java.
3,Waiting for replacement ball,"The original volley ball looked great but the air valve leaked air. It would just hold pressure for maybe 15 minutes and then it was too soft. When I called to complain, they said they would send me a replacement. But then they were out of stock and had to back order with expectations to fullTachikara SV18S Institution and Recreational Play Cordley Composite Leather Volleyball (White)fill by 1/18/08. I called today, 1/18/08 and they said my replacement ball shipped today."
3,"Good, but basic","I bought this book expecting more than what it was. Perhaps it was my fault for not spending more time researching before I bought a book, but whatever the case, I still think this book was slightly lacking. It was a very quick read with many common sense ideas which could be found easily by reading articles on the internet.If you're just starting out with any type of photography, this may be helpful to you. If you've been taking informal pictures for awhile, you will likely already know most of this information."
2,Didn't deliver,"I love to read and love birds, but I just couldn't get into this book. It was a bit dry and I couldn't follow."
1,NOT AT ALL SATISFIED !!!!,KNG America Tony Stewart Vroom Phone (026797)I PURCHASE THIS ON 12/02/07 they sent me a defective product and when I informed of this they told me to send it back and they would correct it and send it back to me I informed them that I purchase this for a christmas present and I was not going to give in february or march !! besides which I should not pay to ship a product that was defective because their carelessness I told them to send me another and I would return theirs ( AT THEIR EXPENSE ) THAT WAS ALMOST 2 WEEKS AGO !! so I AM GOING TO GET A CREDIT OFF MY CREDIT CARD an if they want their phone back they should send me the means to do so I REFUSE TO PAY FOR THEIR CARELESSNES and I will NEVER DEAL WITH THEM AGAIN
1,not impressed,"I have a flip flop necklace from years ago from Avon, ive been trying to find one like it since. Came across this one. Ordered the white, but it has a yellowish tint to it. Does not look white. And the chain is very short. meant for kids. And I have to break the chain to get the fip flop off to put it on another chain. I wont buy another one again."
1,Daughter couldn't eat these!,"These vitamins are horrible tasting. We had tried the berry flavor in the past and my daughter thought those were fine - but I ordered the orange this time because I wanted to go on auto-delivery. My daughter tried one and refused to eat another. I thought she was just being picky so I tried one but I had to agree - these were horrible. They were very sour tasting and the icky ""vitamin"" flavor was very strong. It's possible we got a bad batch but these were really bad... we had to send them back and cancel the auto-delivery. We then ordered the berry flavor again and those are fine. I guess orange just didn't work out for us. The vitamins themselves are great. Good ingredients and quality but that's all kind of pointless if your kid won't eat them."
5,Portugal E Brasil Para Jesus!,"I recently visited Lisboa (Lisbon) Portugal. I came across this CD, after finding the advertising of it across the entire city. Needless to say, it peeked my curiosity. I am not a stranger to Christian music, however, it is not readily available in Portuguese--especially in the United States. As I began to listen to it in the music store, I knew then that I had to buy it. It is such an exciting experience to see a people, predominantly Roman Catholic, shed ceremonious rituals to praise and worship God with ""sincere"" and heartfelt worship. Gloria a Deus! Juntos louvamos em Cristo somos um. Um so espirito e um so coracao. Juntos na visao, proclamar que El e Rei!"
5,Prince of Egypt - Nashville,Very quick return time to me; easy to use when ordering product. Highly recommended.
4,interesting twist moves well it makes you think of the possabilities regarding organ donations and whats in the future,intersting twist and a frightening look at the possablities of organ transplant and how far something like this could go should we be really doing this and where will it stop great read
4,Very different from Harry,"It was interesting to read a book by Michael Connelly that didn't have Harry Bosch as the main character. Terry McCaleb is a very different man coming from a different place, making for an enjoyable new character. Blood Work isn't as gritty as the Bosch novels, giving it sort of a lighter flavor, for lack of a better term.McCaleb's search for the killer who's responsible for his donor heart makes for an interesting and strangely touching read. While it's not a ""keep you guessing until the very end"" kind of mystery, there're still enough twists and turns to keep you interested, not to mention the great character interaction."
3,"Well-written, but convoluted","BLOOD WORK, as the rest of Connelly's books is very wellwritten. But the denoument boggles the imagination. Way too complicated and convoulted to make sense. My advice--keeep it simple."
4,A great introduction to Connelly by way of a briliant plot.,"My first read of a Michael Connelly novel will undoubtedly notbe my last. The plot is creatively interwoven with intricate details and sub-plots which culminate sadly in a somewhat rushed finale. Nevertheless, an interesting read which has prompted me to start at the beginning with "" The Black Echo""."
3,Pleasant Surprise,"This is a good read, not great, not bad, but good. The reasonfor the murders was a bit of a stretch, but made for a different plot line. The irritating L.A. cop was a textbook case of testosterone poisoning, and added an ironic humor (to me) I don't think the author actually intended. I don't normally read modern murder mysteries, since they tend to be a little too gory for me, but this one had little gore and a lot of suspense. Terry's character was very well developed. I hope to see more of him."
4,The book title should be 'Brain Work',"I have to say that this is a great mystery. It has a great setup with a bunch of great twists in it. I know it made me use my brain quite a bit, trying to figure out how everything was going to fit together in the end.My only problem is that the title 'Blood Work' makes you think it's suspenful. It's not. At no point did I feel there was any danger for the main characters, or any character. If you start reading this book, start knowing that the only thing motivating you to turn the pages is the fact that you want to know how the ex-fbi man solves the case, not because you have to know what happens to the people in the end."
5,Bloodwork,I really enjoy this author and I can see Clint Eastwood easily as the star of the upcoming movie (did the author have him in mind beforehand?). Good mystery.
3,pure disappointment,"This book started out so good but it ended much too abrubtly. I think Brian James got sick of writing it or something. Conflicts wre not solved. It was very disappointing. I wouldn't even bother reading it unless you want to learn more about drug culture, because it will only leave you disappointed."
3,A drug induced ride,"Pure Sunshine by Brian James is a story that brings three adolescent friends together after they indulge in hallucinations. Brendon, the main character, and his two friends Kevin and Will, go to school together and decide to take acid during a school week, but disregard the fact they have to be at school the next day. Brendon, Kevin, and Will wander in their small town in Philadelphia hallucinating on acid, which in turn takes on a roller coaster ride of visuals and head games.This story is a drug induced ride that will push any drug induced enthusiast to keep reading this book for its, funny comedic lines, and interesting coming of age experiences these characters go through.--reviewed by Estevan Urrutia"
4,"Good text, bad graphics","The text is informative but not really instructional (i.e able to practice with the book) and the illustrations are done using a B&W computer generated 3D mannequin, making it hard to see exactly what's going on. Still, if you're interested in yiquan, it's a welcome addition."
2,annoying sounds distract from lessons,"Even if the lessons are well arranged, my 7-year old refused to progress past lesson 3 - the sounds are ""baby-ish"" and ""annoying"" and if you turn them off, you lose the benefit of the instruction. You're basically stuck with the sound track and may be forced, like me, to look for another typing software..."
4,Buena.,"La historia es buena y para estar tan resumida, pues dura mas o menos cinco horas, está bien contada. Se entiende la historia, eso si, las sub-historias las cortaron todas pero al final uno se entera de ellas."
3,Pretty good telenovela,"First thing, this edition is way too short to actually be able to tell the story. It is way too edited and you should try to watch the entire thing (if possible an available). Regina was left at the altar by her fiancee. She goes to a ranch she owns and vows never to fall for a man again. In the process she becomes hardened and bitter. But, enter Jose Maria, the owner(?) of the ranch next door. He breaks down her defenses and they fall in love. Of course, a bunch of people try to break them up, especially her cousin (Cynthia Klithbo) who is also in love with Jose Maria. The telenovela is pretty good. It had ok acting, beautiful scenery and the usual plotline: Man and woman fall in love and people try to break them apart."
1,THESE ARE NOT PUPPY PADS!!!!!!,THESE ARE PADS USED ON ELDERLY PEOPLE WHO HAVE TROUBLE GOING TO THE BATHROOM. THIS COMPANY SHOULD BE HONEST AND LET THE PEOPLE WHO ARE CONSIDERING BUYING THEM KNOW THAT THEY ARE NOT PUPPY TRAINING PADS. PUPPY TRAINING PADS HAVE A SPECIAL SCENT ON THEM TO ENCOURAGE THE DOG TO USE IT. DON'T BE FOOLED!!! DO NOT BUY FROM THIS COMPANY!!!!!
2,Repetative,"I agree with Shawna; the lyrics are a bit lame. They just keep repeating themselves. The songs get old real fast. I had really wanted to like this CD, but I was thoroughly disappointed. I thought the songs were very amateurish."
1,Is she serious?,"I have been listening to No Doubt since I was about 12 years old, I am 20 now. I loved them, they were a great ska band. When I bought this cd I thought that it would sound similar to the single, ""What are you waiting for."" Let me tell you, it's nothing like that. This has to be the most disappointing cd I have ever bought.When Gwen did that song with Moby it was great, and all the songs she did with Sublime were great too... when she did that song with Eve I knew she was headed down the wrong path. Now she comes out with a cd that sound like R&B;, Uhg, it's horrible. If you are thinking the CD is going to be anything like no doubt, or her single ""what are you waiting for"" please listen to the demos before wasting your money."
2,what has gwen done?,"the only okay song is whatchu waiting for though that gets annoying and repetitive, same with hollaback girl it just recycles 80's music like the rest of this album. Thanks gwen, you've just lost every bit of credibility and success you've built with no doubt. I can only hope that this album was made just to get her childish girly side out and that she gets her common sense back and makes another brilliant album with her band. I hope no doubt's sales don't go down just because of the mess she put out with this album. Just listen to return of saturn, that stuff is so much better than this garbage"
1,"""Just like Madonna! Yayyyyyy!""","You know an artist is in trouble when her good reviews cite that she's ""like Madonna."" Is that even a lateral move?Gwen Stefani is to popular music what D Ali G is to journalism."
5,Gwen rocks!!!!!,"Gwen Stefani is great.She is so original that her music is a pleasure to listen to.Love, Angel, Music, Baby is just a great set of songs."
1,Lots of Doubt,"Warning: I have only heard the singleI am No Doubt fan...well not sure anymore. THis is obnoxious crap, and I'm seeing things in Gwen i hadn't seen before. And she's getting kinda old and nasty - menapause is just around the corner and she's hoin it up - a little unsettling.GIRL POWER!!!"
1,A 36 year old woman writing music for 13 year olds,"There's really nothing else to say. If you're out of high school and listening to this, I encourage you to ween yourself off the pop-culture trash!"
4,"A quirky, catchy, entertaining album","I rarely buy CDs from our current crop of ""artists"" because everything I hear on the radio just seems to blur together like one big generic song. A BAD song at that. But I know who Gwen is, so I sampled her album on Amazon because I'd heard that it was different, and that it had been nominated for several Grammys. I liked what I heard, so I ordered it and have been listening to it all day at work. I have to say that it is INFECTIOUS. Many of the songs have a retro appeal, reminding me of my 80s ""youth."" They are fresh and flirtatious, and definitely lend themselves to the dance floor. It's so pleasant in this era of musical monotony to hear someting that truly stands out. Gwen and my current favorite, Kelly Clarkson, give me a glimmer of hope that the music industry still understands that vocal talent and originality is ultimately what sells; not the musical clones that come and go so quickly I don't even remember their names."
3,Hara- WHo?,"This CD is okay but I am not impressed with Gwen's solo debut. It has a few songs that I rock well with, but I didn't like her pushyness. Nobody should be calling themselves a ""Stupid H*."" The really enjoyed ""Luxurious"" easy and ""Hollaback Girl"" infectous beat, but the language I could have did without."
1,"This chick is Annoying, Old and Irrelevant","And what the hell is up with those Japanese chicks that follow her around wherever the she goes? It's getting old. I am so sick of this annoying 90's has-been... and her ""acting"" debut? What a joke."
1,disastisfied with explicit language,I am unable to play this CD in the car with my children due to the language. There were no warnings or ratings on this CD or I would not have purchased. The songs are different than those played on the radio---curse words are all throughout at least one of the songs.
3,Very Good first attempt!,"I think some of us are being a little harsh on Ms. Stefani. This is her first album. Give her a break! I'm happy that she went solo! She is the reason for No Doubts success. I really like the album. There are some bombs on it but I think the next one will be better. Of course, Whatcha Waiting for? is the best! Rich Girl, HollaBack Girl, and Cool are good. But I also like Bubble Pop Electric(I know the lyrics suck!)I think its a good combo of pop and a pinch of R"
1,HUH?,THIS ALBUM REMINDS ME OF A SPOILED CHICKEN SANDWICH. WHY ANYONE WOULD LISTEN TO SPOILED SANDWICH IS BEYOND ME... BUT I GUESS IT'S AT LEAST A LITTLE BETTER THAN THE SONG 'SPIDER WEB.'GEESH
1,Loser. Annoying. Music? Bad.,"I hate hate hate this garbage. Radio play her songs 2930 times a day. Rich Girl is so BAD, What you wating fot is damn BAD, Cool is freakin boring, I don't even wanna say ""Hollaback girl""this dumb single name.This is a real tragic kingdom. plus some weirdo Japanese girls."
3,"What You Waiting For?...Well, A Lot More I Guess","Ok, well this is how I view this cd. It shows exactly why artistsshould follow their own style instead of what the record company wants them to do. Now, I know she was trying to be different then""Gwen of No Doubt"" but- this cd actually makes you miss that sideof her. What happened to the more personal storyteller Gwen? That's what I was waiting for and missed. If you like the varietyof producers on each track then this is for you but based on the material, I'd say you're not missing much.3 stars, 1 for Gwen and 2 for the album."
1,I like No Doubt - but this is a different story,"Only 1 good song on this one (whatcha waiting for). Waste of money. Gwen is smoking hot as far as looks are concerned, but this cd is teeny-bopper, bubble-gum garbage."
3,worth it for the 80's sounds,this album is worth it for her using 80's sounds and hearing how she combines them with modern beats. I prefer the dance/electronica gwen over the dance/hip hop gwen though this album has a bit of both.
1,Bad... real bad.,"After you get through listening to this rather sickeningly self-indulgent promo piece, do yourself a HUGE favor and put on Bright Eyes' ""I'm Wide Awake, It's Morning"". You'll feel renewed. (I know I did...)Btw, the one star is for the opening track, which is a great dance song. That's the only one I can bear to listen to."
3,"Give it a rest -- it's a solo album not No Doubt, the remix","I think a lot of the reviewers expected this album to be an extension of what Stefani has done with No Doubt. But her choices in terms of solo collabos would indicate that her tastes are quite a departure from the No Doubt sound. I personally thought the album was a cute surprise, especially since I am not much of a No Doubt fan and am at best an occasional listener of alt/rock music. I think it is admirable that Stefani attempts to bridge different musical styles, showing that she has an appreciation of multiple musical genres. The R&B/hip-hop infused songs are hilariously wonderful, if for no other reason than an itty bitty, white as bleached flour white girl pulls them off and makes them authentic club joints. Anyone who can get B-more thugs and the OC/teeny bopper types all jamming to one album is a master."
1,Wanted to like it...,"But it is noise!This is a waste of money, naturally you shouldn't buy it expecting No Doubt (duh people) but you shouldn't buy it just because it is awful, horrible music! Too many styles thrown in here does not make it ""unique"", it just makes it hard on the ears. In my opinion this album has MAYBE two tracks that measure up to ""What you waiting for"", which are ""Danger Zone"" and ""The real thing"". The rest does not nearly measure up.It's true what a lot of these reviews have touched on, Gwen has let the music dogs get a hold of her and they have totally zapped her creativity here in favor of sales. Wretched tunes paired with horrible lyrics, and then the entire album is indeed vain, numerous plugs for Gwen's L.A.M.B. line worked into the songs. Buy it used or burn it!"
2,Gwen Goes *Pop*!,"I was interested in listening to this CD after I heard the first two singles ""What you waitin for"" and ""Holla Back"", Im up for a little poptronica with some absurd gangster influence.After listening to this album, I was really dissappointed though.Stefani seems to be trying to be an 80's Madonna ressurection, which, in my book, is near the equivilant of summoning the anti-christ. Fashion and money obsessed, Stefani comes across strongly as a modern material girl, with a crush on Japan, and who likes to bring up her adventures in the back seats of cars as a reoccuring theme. And please tell me she's trying to be funny with all the white-girl gangster talk.So if you like 80's era Madonna, you will probobly like this. Its full of sappy synths and gooey vocals that take you to the tablespoon depths of Stefani's hopes and dreams; ""If I was a rich girl, I'd have all the money in the world, if I was a wealthy girl.""Well Gwen, now what?"
5,totally fab-u-las!!!!!!,what you waiting for is soo good and funny.why are the haroshoku girls following her.their ruining her!! but she still rocs!please hate haroshoku GIRLS PLEASE!! their freaky!
2,I Like Gwen Stefani...,"...but, this album did absolutely nothing for me. It had its high points. The lyrics were okay, but she won't win a Pulitzer for them. The best songs are RICH GIRL, HOLLABACK GIRL, LUXURIOUS, and LONG WAY TO GO. Those are the only ones I can stand to listen to more than once every time I pop in the cd. BUBBLE POP ELECTRIC is a very stupid song.The most ANNOYING thing on this album had to be the fact that in almost every song, she mentions those Japanese minions she has following her around, the Harajuku Girls. She even has a song for them aptly titled HARAJUKU GIRLS. It was cute up to a point, but it really is annoying. Another annoying thing is that in HOLLABACK GIRL, she says s*** way too many times. It becomes overdone after about the tenth time.So, if you like Madonna-esque songs, then this album is for you. If not, steer clear from it and you will be one happy camper."
3,A fun but at times a childish cd,"Gwen Stefani's first solo cd is good and she has touch to become the next Madonna or cher. The cd is good but not great like veryone is saying. There is such great songs like 'What You Waiting For?' which is a fun catchy song, 'Rich Girl' which was pretty good but not great,'Hollaback Girl' which is one of the best songs on the cd, and 'Cool' which is the best song on the cd and is one of the best songs of the year. All of those songs are the best ones there are ok ones after that butt hat's it. The cd is too childish in some songs but some people may like that. Overall it is a good cd but not great."
1,Pedestrian Synthesizer 80's Cliche,"It's no surprise that this album is doing well. The worse the music in this country, the better it does. Look at Britney Spears and all those Boy Bands. Mediocrity reigns supreme and this album is the king of the hill. Some songs are just tired and pedestrian, with childlike rhyming schemes like ""Don't go away, my love. Want you to to stay."" Some songs don't even have a rhyming scheme at all. Some songs are clunky and 80s with a bad synthesizer sound that has long been abandoned by most artists and now you can only hear at family barbeques and church events. Some songs have no memorable melody at all, but all songs on this album do have the commonality of sucking."
3,Good,It's really a good album but I wouldn't recommend buying it because pretty soon you'll be tired of it because it is WAY overplayed.
4,This album is not a No Doubt album,"I have listened to No Doubt since they first came about and loved all of their stuff. I would say that this is NOTHING like their early stuff. If that's what you're looking for, move on. But this is a very fun CD. It's not for those who found solace in Gwen's No Doubt lyrics. This is a CD to break out and dance to with your friends (especially if you're drunk). I enjoyed it."
5,Upbeat Dance Craze,"I just got this cd the other day and I am completely amazed and quite satisfied with what it has to offer. Hearing a recommendation from a friend, it sounded like a really dance-like album and that it was. This album is filled with unique styles of music from the 70's, 80's, 90's, and a mix of electronic hip. I think this is definitely worth a purchase. Despite criticism from other reviews, calling on Gwen saying it is very teen like, well, so what? What's your point? Gwen has so much creativity in her music, and for someone who has been in this profession since the age of 17, what would you expect? Most musicians have a teen fan base, and I admire her music and I am 15. I can't say anything bad about this album because it is very well done and gwen shines. I hope she has more to come. And for her to still be making music today, that shows real talent."
4,Fun Album,"A lot of people gave this album terrible reviews, but I think that they're taking it too seriously. Yeah, Gwen is grown and approaching 40, but on a lot of the songs I think that they were meant to sound like high school. The majority of the CD is hilarious, and it's definitely something I'll put in my CD player if I want to hear something kinda of wild and upbeat. But in order to enjoy this album, you can't take Gwen too seriously."
4,Her cd abducted me in the Tower Records listening station!,"I had some time to pass in between two private hatha yoga classes I was teaching, so I stopped into Tower Records listening station... I saw Gwen's new cd, and thought what the heck...Wow!!! I was blown away... She raps, sings, does spoken word... Throws in retro and dance beats now and then...It's more eclectic in music styles that I thought it would be...and it's definitely on my list of cds to buy in the future...Though I would prefer it comp since I'm a cd dj...My two favorite tracks are...'Bubble Pop Electric' - very bubbly cute with nice beatsand I love the rap between Gwen and Johnny...and...'What You Waiting For' - a track that's a little harder and a little faster and definitely worthy...So to all music lovers and djs - buy this cd - DJ Dakini-NYC aka Savannah Skye..."
1,Works Well As A Drink Coaster,"10 years ago, she was actually in a band making real music. Today, she's becoming the next Britney Spears and making us choke on our vomit."

1,Terribly Annoying,"I thought ""what you waiting for"" was an incredibly fun and catchy song, so i thought i might like gwen...then come her other ""hit songs""...hollaback girl is effin annoying, as is rich girl, and everything else that comes out of her mouth.What happened to only good singers getting famous? voice doesnt even matter anymore"
1,"B, Bowl movement, B B Bowl Movement Movement B, Bowl movement","Simple doesnt begin to describe this aweful Gwen Stefani, as monkey nuts doesnt begin to describe what a disservice Gwen does to genuine No Doubt fans and anyone hoping for something more from this idiot. Sell out, sell out, sell out, goes the high school cheeleader rant. Gwenn gladly complies and gives all the old ska and punk fans of the early 90s nothing but a dose of her wonderful clothing line with this horrible chunk of garbage. Enjoy another Lakers game Gwenn and hire some more slave labor for your piece of crap clothing line, a few of us remember your nothing without Bradley Nowell and real musicians."
5,I don't have it....,"I love the album,but I don't have it and I am not going to get it.I am not going to get because I have all the songs recorded on a tape.I got the songs on Kiis Fm.I really enjoyed it!.Here's how I rate the tracks:1.What You Waiting For?-5/52.Rich Girl f/Eve-3/53.Hollaback Girl-4/5-For some reason Kiis Fm didn't play this track.I don't know why,but I heard some of the song on TRL and I loved it when I heard it!4.Cool-4/55.Bubble Pop Electric-3/56.Luxurious-5/57.Harajuku Girls-5/58.Crash-3/59.The Real Thing-5/510.Serious-5/511.DangerZone-3/512.Long Way To Go-4/5Overall,I am not going to buy this,but you should.I am going to buy Avril Lavigne-Under My Skin and Lindsay Lohan Speak.Bye!!"
2,Quit ripping off B.I.G!,"Did you know that the melody in ""Luxurious"" is the EXACT SAME MELODY as The Notorious B.I.G.'s ""Big Poppa"", except slowed down? No joke!Anyway, Hollaback Girl saves this disc from total failure. 'Nuff said."
4,Love it!,"L.A.M.B.--- Now here is Gwen's solo debut and what an effort she gave the first time out. I love this CD and find myself humming or chanting some of the choruses throughout the work day. I practically live in my car so this CD has been in the player since day one. I really do not have a fav song, but I do like the ballad ""Cool"". I recently saw the video on VH1 and could not take my eyes off it.Very well done Gwen, hope to see more from you!"
1,SELL OUT!!!!,"I only gave this CD one star because that was the lowest I could go. I could not wait till Christmas to see if My husband answered my wish list, Pleased as I was to find this in my stocking. Pleased that is until I popped it in the player. Song one is good, I have heard it on the radio but the rest, I only got to about song 7 when I had to pop it out. HORRIBLE!!! Gwen you sold out my friend. Bring back No Doubt!!!"
2,Two great songs!,"And they both get a star apiece: ""Rich Girl"" and ""Hollaback Girl."" The rest is recycled 80's new wave fluff."
5,Spunky Funky Fun Music,"If you loved No Doubt, I am sure you would at least like this CD. It is different of course, she has no band, it is more electronic in the background, but it has a great sound. It is fun music. Lyrics are silly but her voice is great as usual. The cd has a mix of hip hop, r n b, dance, club, and 80s rock which is really cool. I would recommend getting it if you know you like Gwen!"
4,Solo Success,"Yes, ""musicians"" like Gwen Stefani are a dime a dozen.Is she eye candy? Yes.Can she sing? Yes.Do we talk about her more because of Gavin Rossdale? Yes.Stefani is many things. One thing she is not is original. But is that the point of this record? In my view, no. This record is Gwen's tip toe into the deep end of the pool. She figures she's learned the lessons of the shallow end and it is time for her to test her limits.The tracks are good. A lot of credit goes to the production staff. The samples are put together nicely to gel with Stefani's vocals. However, this record is clearly an MTV record. Everything about it screams for TRL attention. It makes sense as a solo album. The formula only really works with the support of MTV.I give the record 4 stars. I give it 4 because I still like it despite the assembly line fabrication. They're party tracks. I can't count the DJ compliments the tracks carry. ""Serious"" and ""What are you Waiting for"" garner the most airplay."
1,"why, why, WHY?!","I've always been a No Doubt fan, even when they left ska for pop, and Gwen has amazing style, but dear god almighty, what was she thinking?! The thing I've noticed from reading the other reviews is that people usually either love it or hate it, and I think age might have something to do with it. Kids, anyone old enough to remember the 80's saw that decade go with little remorse (unless they were a Reagan fan); trust me, let it die already. The era of teased hair and leg warmers was painful enough the first time around without Gwen dredging it all up in a painful attempt to break the status quo of pop music in the new milennium. One moderatly good song does not justify a whole damn album. It's embarresing. And I'd appreciate her constant self-indulgent referrences to the Harajuku district in Tokyo if she actually incorporated some elements of Japanese pop music (a lot better than her crap) instead of just repeating the name over and over. Better luck next time, Gwen."
3,VERY DIFFERENT SOUND FOR GWEN...,"...And far removed from her band No Doubt! I was eagerly anticipating this solo venture from Gwen, esp. after hearing & so enjoying the song: What you waiting for, but it turns out that was. After buying and listening to the whole album a couple of times I am just very disappointed! I was hoping for more great songs like, What you waiting for, but much of this album has a more hip-hop/R&B feel to it and in general does not flow that well. Gwen still is an excellent singer and there is originalty in this solo work, though it just doesn't seem like it's completely Her behind this album. It's okay for what it is, but Gwen could have done so much more! Maybe next time..."
2,"'No Doubt' About It, It's L. A. M. E.","More a fashion fiasco than a seriously taken musical ideal, Stefani has remained a tormentor throughout the years posing as the lead `singer' of the faux-Ska-Meets-Mtv No Doubt. But this was to be a departure of that dissipated sound, and as a lifetime foe, I clasped my hands and hoped for a revelation - but what I get was armageddon. Here she's zip-code's one target - bad, cheesy L.A. New Wave Pop of the 80s. Her Betty Boop stylings and porn-star hiccup vocals fit right in - Terri Nunn would be proud. Her affected trendiness, her superficial, safe use of guest vocals [Eve...AGAIN!?], her nonsensical acronym of the title [just what the hell is LAMB but a blatant commercial for her tacky clothing line?] and she looks the part of Madonna circa Blond Ambition. How does one, so early in her career, become a caricature of one's own self? My grade: C-"
3,New Year's Eve,This movie did not really appeal to me. It was good but too many story lines. The acting was good and the actors did a good job with the script they were given.
4,Feel Good Flick,Just a fun movie with lots of feelings.....Something the whole family can watch and laugh and cry with and enjoy.
3,Blu-ray Review: 'New Year's Eve',"Garry Marshall follows up his last holiday film ""Valentine's Day "" with ""New Year's Eve."" It's not an actual sequel like most people thought when it was first announced. You could call it more of a companion piece. They have the same general structure but with different characters.If you haven't seen ""New Year's Eve"" yet, don't expect too much. It's a nice little movie to watch with your significant other for a date night. If you've already seen it and want to own it for your home entertainment collection, the ""New Year's Eve"" Blu-ray will satisfy consumers with a good high definition transfer of the film and plenty of extra features."
4,Chick Flick Alert! But a nice one!,"Can you say CHICK FLICK? Well, since I am a chick I'm totally fine with that label! :-)Ok, as you may have guessed this is a movie about many NYE stories in NYC and happy/romantic new year beginnings. No big secrets or complicated plots on this one (and, sorry guys, nothing gets blown up) - just sit back and enjoy the ride.(A good one to have so you can watch it on NYE if you tend to celebrate at home in your jammies.)I thought it was charming and enjoyable, I teared up a little and smiled a little and have no complaints. Stephanie Alexander sings twice (beautifully!) and her version of Auld Lang Syne is wonderful.Enjoy!"
1,AwfulL,Predictabke until it drops off a cliff at the end leaving nothing resolved. I want my 2 hours back. A a a a a a a a a a a
5,New Year's Eve,"A perfect ""feel good"" movie for this year's Christmas gathering when supper was taking longer than planned, and the natives were getting restless."
2,Disappointed...,"This is one of the worst movies I've seen this year. I had great expectation and been patiently waiting the DVD to arrive at my mail box. After watching it I just felt being robbed of 2 hours of my life. Seeing so many great actors in this movie really excited me, but the movie is just plain boring and such a disappointment. The storyline is so plain and weak, the characters totally lack of connection and no sparks between each couples whatsoever. The actors, being all A-list big names and all, played horribly like they didn't even care. The only one that actually caught my eye and was playing his role decently with efforts is Zac Efron. The others, including Robert De Niro and Michelle Pfeiffer, were so bad like they didn't get paid making this movie. I thought Valentine's Day was bad enough, but New Year's Eve is just unbearable. If you want to watch a fun and romantic comedy with bunch of A list actors, I would recommend Love Actually. Skip this one unless you've got a lot time."
5,just like in the movies,glad i purchased the dvd just like when i saw in the movies even got to see parts that i missed the first time i saw this movie
1,I fell asleep halfway through the thing.,"A real snoozefest. Don't waste your money. They'll never recapture the wit, humor, and charm of Love Actually. This is the third attempt I've seen. Complete fail."
5,highly recommended,"I first heard this on tape in 1989, after visiting the Cathedral. I would not generally describe myself as a fan of ""organ music,"" but this is not organ music. No category helps one guess what this music might sound like. It's powerful, beautiful, subtle, uplifting and crushing and peaceful all at once -- like the great organ and the cathedral itself. The cathedral is really an integral part of the instrument, and it's obvious that Halley knows it well."
5,Awsome,"As an Ayurvedic esthetician, not only was this the perfect text book, but as a wonderful reference book, too. It is well written, easy to read, informative and the cover is especially telling. The woman balancing the three doshas is the perfect picture of what we try to do with our lives. Sandra"
2,kill bill 2,this is a cool kill bill sword but it is not like the photo but they give me a cheep kill bill sword and I dont like it but I went to [...] and it looks like the photo better deal if you want a better deal then go to swordsswords I pad only[..]but it mite be more money but it looks just like the photo that you see.
2,looks cool but a piece...,it got here right after i ordered it. when i pulled it out of the box the handle fell off. it is a massive piece of crap.
1,Decieving,"I was able to bend this katana with my hands!!! what the heck this thing is a real piece. And it is not even sharp. This is a really suckish katana, no wonder it was only 13 bucks. I will certainly not be buying from thins seller again."
2,NOt what is described!,"Great sword, but did not include stand and Hanso stamp on blade. I must return for these reasons. I would be happy if the stand would have been included"
3,Uhh...its for display people...,Do not buy this thinking you will cut through some spun straw...you wont be able too...But as a present its great!
2,Keystone LeClic,"I had this camera for about a year the pitcures turn out okay not the greatest (you get alot of red eye.)The first one of these broke on me, I returned it and got another this one has lasted for almost a year and for the price you can't beat it!"
1,Better Off Avoiding,"If you're looking for pictures of famous people and their tattoos/body adornments, avoid this book! Why you may ask? Well here's my answer:Although the book is well organized in sections of the famous (sometimes the author makes them sound more infamous) from musicians to models, several of the pictures and people mentioned don't even have pictures of their tattoos! Some are even described lousy - you can clearly see a specific tat on the picture, yet there is no mention in the description. This book also has more scoop and snarky comments about the goings on of said celebrity, rather than focusing on what this book is titled and supposed to be about. All in all this book has more celebrity poop, and not much about celebrity body adornment and should be avoided if you're specifically looking for what the title is stating"
1,"Great Book, EXTREMELY LATE DELIVERY","This is a great book as I've read it before and lost the book so I wanted to re-order it. It's a perfect book to go with your multi-book collection of self-help, let me learn farsi, books. By no stretch can this be used in isolation. It must be a part of a comprehensive program, perhaps at a school. I know this is used at UCSD's Heritage Language Programs."
1,Awful awful awful,"Probably one of the worst tutorial books ever written. I doubt how anyone without degree in grammatics could ever understand this book. It gets infuriating to read after the first few pages, and i put it down after less than 2days. I tried to return it to the bookshop, but a refund was refused because of the pages i'd torn out in anger.Unless you're masochistic, or have a degree in in-depth grammar, keep away, well away.Though the actual tutorial was half-decent, Thackston's use of unclearly explained and complex grammar (just to show off I would guess) put me well off.Stick to Mace or Rafiee."
1,A misleading title,"The title of the book is misleading. Instead of ""Introduction to Persian Languages"" it should have been ""Summary of Persian Grammar and Idioms"" as it really is, no more. If this is the best book in this subject then I don't envy students of Persian language! It can be helpfull as a reference book for instructors. The fact that the book has no accompanying cassete or CD to help in pronunciation justify this conclusion. All in all, a lifeless book."
2,Not for the home gym...,Doesn't cater to the home gym much. Many of the exercises need to be revised in order for someone with an average home gym to perform the workouts.Lots of pictures though.
2,hard to explain why i dont liek this book.,"Hmmmm how do i put this into words? I simply just didn't find this book very helpful. All the info it gives is basic basic basic almost everything in it i already knew. The workout plans towards the end of the book just don't do it for me either. I wish i would have purchased the encyclopedia of body building instead. Before i purchased this book i purchased ""Mens Health-Big Book of Exercises"" and I personally believe that book is leap and bounds better over this one in every way, but that's me. If i had to do over again id pass on this purchase."
4,Wonderful book,"It's a great text. It is the best workout program I have ever been involved with, period. My one problem with the book is I felt more should have been spent on nutritional information. However, as a workout manual, and also as a nice illustration of anatomy, this book can't be beat. I highly recommend it to anyone who desires an innovative, effective, and challenging workout. Also, it is a beautiful book...the pictures and diagrams make it an excellent reference after your 6 month(s) of workouts are over."
5,Totally Complete,"From my personal perspective, as a BEGINNER, it is an essential book to have in my collection.The reason is the info it provides on not only nutrition but on almost every exercise that could be done. It gives clear instructions with excellent photos to go along with the exercises. Now, that would describe most other books, however this goes above and beyond by giving a VERY complete (IMO) anatomy lesson on the muscles, tendons and so forth. What they do and why they do it and how you can hurt them if you are stupid.I can say with out a doubt this book needs to be in any serious gym rat or health conscious persons library. You will refer back to it often even if you never do a single routine that it has set up, which, by the way are very well designed and NOT a two hour ordeal as some have described.Thanks Lou!"
4,Great if you have a home Gym,"Let me start by saying that I can be spared the unnecessary full page photos of body builders in the begining of the book.. The writing in the first two parts of the book answers some questions that I had about certain hormones and general questions on metabolism and muscle. The third part where the exercises are demonstrated is very good and finally the workout plan is also great. Unless you can find a really good trainer at the local gym, a book like this is a must."
3,Rowdy early Hoyt,"While the cover photo is from the 70s, the music actually dates from 1964. So instead of the mostly mellow country sounds you might expect, you get his rowdy style of electric folk that sounds somewhere between Sam the Sham and the Pharoahs and The Band. Its not bad but just not what you expect given the cover photo. His singing here is like what he did on his version of The Pusher. Wild but intense."
2,good begining HORIBLE end,"I don't want to give the end away, so I'll try not to. The end was Horible, the arther made everything turn out perfectly, maybee you like endings like that, but I HATE them."
2,Dragon's Blood,The book Dragon's Blood is about a boy who is kept as a watcher in his masters cave watching the dragons eggs.Its wrong for him to take an egg but he has a strong feeling that there is a dragon in the paticular egg that he goes to. He can't be sure about this because not all the eggs hatch. He wants to be a great trainer but ts hard.I would recomend this book to a young age group.
4,Raising A Snatchling Dragon,"Better than expected... reminded me ofJoust (The Dragon Jousters, Book 1)with how the baby dragon was snatched, and reminded me ofDragonsong (Harper Hall Trilogy, Book 1)with the detailed and interesting scenes of how the young hatchling was raised... down to a fight against natural predators.In a nutshell, Jakkin, who is a bondling at a battle dragon farm, contrives to raise and train his own dragon. He's only fifteen, so not much romance, and the question of the girl he likes (Akki) is left open-ended. But this is only the first book of many, and after enjoying it, I'm open to reading more of Yolen. Despite being set on a faraway planet, it's all fantasy elements -- dragons and lower caste workers and such. That may change in the later series.A simple novel about a young man and his dragon, with dragon fighting. I liked it."
5,This is one of the best books that I have ever read.,"I really enjoyed reading this because of it's excitement. It really made me think about our intelligence and how it relates to that of other animals in the world. The dragon's commentary was very funny and lightened the serious mood. To summarize it in one word, SPLAT !"
5,I'm Slow - I'm Fat - This is the perfect book,I love the title and it just gets better from there. The book was a great read - very fun. It also took the edge off my training for my first triathlon - Sprint distance finished in 1:35. Thanks
4,"Great set of glasses, if slightly small for my needs","These are great! I love the look and feel - they're not heavy, but rather feel just sturdy enough (instead of dainty like so many) with a nice stem and slim bowl thickness at the rim. However, they are small at 8oz. I'd suggest the same glass in the larger size, 11oz I believe. I have both and tend to use the 11oz ones for both red and white wine."
5,everlasting!!!,"This set was my engagement gift 22 years ago. Still love the styling, they still look great and the weight in your hands tells you these are not cheap. After kids scraping their plates in the garbage, along with my teaspoons and salad fork sized pieces...I need to replace the missing pieces. Instead of buying a whole new set of something I have seen in many stores, trendy, etc. I came back to this set. Classic, quality and beautiful."
4,One word...Excellent!,Awesome documentary. Goes hand in hand with the book King Leopold's Ghost by Adam Hochschild.
2,Novelty item but not good for chess,"As far as novelty items go, it's great for kids who like dinosaurs. That's about where it ends. The pieces themselves are so small, it's very difficult to distinguish between one piece and another, even for a dinosaur fossil enthusiast; for a person who's just trying to play chess, it's infuriating. If you're buying this as a toy for the sake of buying a dinosaur-related toy, a gateway to actual chess, then great. If you're intending to actually play chess with it, look elsewhere."
2,A failed carbon copy of the original,"I started reading Mr. Darcy's Daughters with optimism, I could tell Ashton was a seasoned writer who expertly described characters and the feel of London society at that time. Halfway through it I saw a failed attempt to re-do the original storyline of Pride and Prejudice. The author should have been more original in taking on the creation of the Darcy daughters. It became silly and contrived with plots that had no build up to make them believable. Such as the youngest daughter's male cross-dressing and one of the twins running off with an older already married man to Paris and taking one of the sisters along as a french interpreter?I will stick to Linda Berdoll; an author who decided to take an original and daring path of the Pride and Prejudice sequel, instead of trying to mimic Austen. I suggest you skip this one if you're looking to be dazzled."
3,A Little Disappointing,"The book is okay, in a cute, light-summer-reading sort of way, but I was disappointed. Firstly, I felt that some of the character portrayals were not very accurate, especially Fitzwilliam and the Gardners. And I agree with the reviewer who commented that no child of Darcy and Elizabeth Bennet would turn out like Letitia, their eldest in this novel. Finally, there are several parallels to P&P in this book's plot, and I found that too contrived and unrealistic.And I was hoping Lizzie and Darcy would return at the end so we could catch a glimpse of them."
3,Not convincing enough,"First of all, I think the story would have been more entertaining if Elizabeth and Darcy had been around instead of mysteriously taking a trip for almost more than a year. Who does that, and leaves five young daughters in someone else's care? And Elizabeth, for all the sense she possessed, cannot be thought of as having 3 very stupid daughters. Only Camilla and Alethea were the saving graces of this novel. Ditto for Mrs. Gardiner who was portrayed to be Elizabeth's favorite aunt, having a dumb daughter like Sophie. I have never understood how with being under one roof and one set of parents, 3 girls were never corrected and let to go as they pleased. All in all, it did not come across as an accurate portrayal, and did not leave me satisfied with the ending."
1,Poor imitation,"Its a risky thing to write a sequel to a classic novel...the author shouldn't have attempted it. The novel has Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth out of the country while their 5 daughters (what a coincidence?) run amok in London. The fact that the Darcy's have 5 daughters, whose personalities match the 5 original Bennett girls is irritating (2 stupid/silly girls, one pious girl, one pretty girl etc...). Really, since Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy were both appalled at her own family's manners and upbringing, I find it highly unlikely that they would let their unmarried girls loose on London without their supervision. The fact that the author created an elopment scandal as in the original book was lame. Skip this book."
2,Austen anyone?,"I'm halfway through this book, and, being a die-hard Austen fan, am as shocked as some of the other reviewers with the author's easy handling of characters from P&P;, with no resemblance at all to Austen's original intentions regarding Fitzwilliam (who is but a tiny presence in P&P;, so EA can be forgiven for changing his character), but no such mercies for the handling of Mrs. Gardiner, who occupies a substantial chunk of P&P; (Austen has rounded her off quite well).It's hard to follow Austen, but someone who is touted as a ""passionate Jane Austen fan who studied with (an) Austen biographer,"" (from the author's bio. at the back) should have respected her idol's boundaries a little more."
2,Can intelligent people raise stupid daughters?,"I suppose Mr. Darcy's Daughters would be fine for people who like the genre, but it assumes two very large stretches of imagination in its premise. Is it likely Elizabeth Bennett and Mr. Darcy would raise such silly daughters? And how plausible is it that a man as proud as Mr. Darcy would send his five heiress daughters to London during the season without his own oversight?This was a replay of Pride and Prejudice with the girls' temperatments shuffled, but the story is pretty much the same. Adding more modern touches, Aston also included a gay man and an unmarried Darcy daughter getting pregnant, apparently without anyone noticing.Preposterous. I read the whole thing, but became more and more agitated as the story continued. Ms. Aston has done her historical homework, but her story rings false."
2,"Entertaining, nothing more.","This one was better than Mr. Darcy Takes A Wife. Darcy and Elizabeth have 5 daughters and have left them in the care of Colonel Fitzwilliam and his wife while they go on a diplomatic mission. Predictably, it's about the adventures of said daughters and not about Darcy and Elizabeth. The daughter's personalities are predictable yet again, and similar to the Bennet sisters of Longbourne.While not a suitable sequel to Pride and Prejudice, this one is entertaining. I bought it, and then sold it, so it wasn't worthy of remaining on my bookshelf, but it is certainly worthy of checking out of the library if you want to be entertained for a couple of hours."
2,Elizabeth in Constantinople!,"As an Austen fan I have read practically all sequels to P&P. This one has a very imporatant fault from my POV: the author sent Elizabeth and Darcy to Istanbul and forgot them here. Instead we have a bunch of lively girls who are positioned as Mr. Darcy Daughters and have very little manners if at all. It seems that Elizabeth was a very careless mother and Darcy - a very indifferent father.All other personages are transformed and transformed very strangely. For example, Lydia and Gardiners becomes the cream of the ton!The story would be passable as ""A Daughters of Somebody"" but as a sequel of P&P it is simply uninteresting because the main heroes are absent and all others are not like themselves at all. I strongly recommend 1) the author to rename the story and sell it as not so bad Regency romance and 2) the Austen fans use their time more profitably and reread ""Bar Sinister""."
4,Get ready to sweat!,"Like most fat burners, Cha De Bugre Fat Burner does not work well if you're expecting a miracle drug. This supplement boosts your energy, but also raises your core body temperature which allows you to burn more fat. Your body can not do this without sweating. I would recommend to someone also using a work-out routine and can stay extremely hydrated."
2,cha de bugre,I didn't see too much difference on the way I usually crave foods but the pills give you energy without the jittery feeling.
5,Electric Africa Rebound,"Manu Dibango was an African Afrojazz musician. In the eighties he met a Western musician/producer/world enthusiest Bill Laswell. Together they put together one great global album, ""Electric Africa"". I have the original cassette and was pleased that a CD was available when searched for on this site. Beside Dibango and his African band, several Western musicians join in including Laswell on DMX, Fairlight and Herbie Hancock playing a Yamaha DX-7. This is a blend of Afro-Western music that really works. Fans of global music should be very pleased with this superb album."
2,Suspended Animation,"Generic 1980s/90s slick stuff here, with a few memorable choruses, does not a good album make. The only track that offers something that breaks the mold is ""Suspended Animation"", a wonderful electronica-based track, which has a nice, easy, unforced feel, a good vibe, and a strong memorable hook. This track alone is worth hearing, but as for the rest...don't say I didn't warn you."
1,"Good in theory, but not for ""real life""","Just look at the advertised picture of this table...beautiful, but once you get it home and set it up, far less enchanting! The glass top is super heavy,the space between the top of the tank and the glass top is too wide (I lost a few fish that escaped this way). I ended up having to modify the table by purchasing an acrylic top, drilling holes on the four corners to lower decrease the gap. Also, there is a condensation problem if you don't have the tank temp. almost excatly the same as the room temp. I definitely believe this is a big time waste of money and do not recommend this to anyone.If you are looking for a good tank, try the Nanocube, or one of the marineland eclipse tanks. They are good, reliable, easy to use."
3,Fish,"Very nice, but for the money should have more de orations. Very nice tank, great talk piece for when company comes"
4,Good Addition to the Watch Wardrobe,"I have been a longtime fan of the Citizen Eco-Drives, and this is the latest addition to my watch wardrobe, and my 5th Eco-Drive...all of which I still wear.These watches are durable, reliable, water-resistant, and work very well.I would say this particular one a more formal gold-tone watch with a simple design, lightweight, and suitable for work or evening... at this price, it's fabulous."
3,"I'm a big fan, but ...",Did not enjoy this too much. Not enough lfe to it in most places. I'll write this one off and move on to the next Kim Wilson offering. Oh well. That's Life.
4,Really nice music,"There is very little music for guitar and chorus, but this version of Castelnuovo-Tedesco's Romancero Gitano is beautifully played and recorded."
2,Very weak string,"Title says it all. I bought this string to tie up cardboard for recycling purposes, and it won't hold even two or three cut-up boxes. It just tears with slight pressure. If you want to tie cake boxes in a bakery, then this is good, but if you need strength stay away."
3,A bit of a disappointment,"I purchased this book based on other people's positive reviews, but was a bit disappointed in it when it arrived. Our twins are not our first children, and this book seemed to have a lot of advice about infants generally rather than twins. Some of the suggestions about products you really need or really don't were interesting, but these are always particular to one's situation, so they were not all that helpful."
3,"Funny read, but not the advice I was looking for","This book was definitely funny -- a true ""girlfriends"" guide to raising twins. When I bought it, I was hoping for a book containing more solid advice regarding everything concerning twins. This book definitely contains advice, but most of it I already knew from just having the babies. If you are looking for something fun to read, this is the book for you. If you want an abundance of sound advice, I would get a book written by a medical professional. I wouldn't reccommend buying this book -- maybe rent it from the library."
3,Mmmh? What happened?,"I think definetly this is a complicate piece of work to hear, it is a good record but in my opinion they went to far with their sound, too heavy and monotonous, almost near to heavy metal sound, too diferent from their records in the past, it is not a continuation of the last album Pornographic Messiah, (wich was absolutly awesome), at all. Maitri sings good (shouts too much...), but specifically in this album I missed Gitane Demone's interventions. Good record but hoping the next will be better."
2,Don't Waste Your Time,"Author John Westermann is a writer and once was a police officer, so he has inside knowledge of how a novel of this kind (mystery/thriller) should work. He writes well, he plots well; but he commits two cardinal sins in his novel. First, he fails to give us a point-of-view and, because he does not do so, (Secondly) he never makes us give a damn about any character in his scenario. When an author does this, no matter how fascinating the facts of his plot may be (and in this novel they are not interesting) we ""trudge"" through the book instead of being swept along by the writer. Long before the end of the story I was bored and tired of the plot, the people, and of Westermann's inability to make me care, even a little. On the other hand, if you have insomnia - here's your cure!"
1,no,"Ugh! I suppose this camera would be great if it worked. I bought it, and before I even installed the software, it broke. I guess if you have faith your's will work, go ahead and buy it. As for me, I'm looking for a better camera, and I might even splurge a bit."
2,Very Technical and Difficult to Understand,"This book was the required textbook for a Master's Degree course in library science which I recently completed. I wish the instructor would have chosen a different book. This book is full of technical jargon that is very difficult to understand. Having worked in a library for the past ten years, I still found the terminology used in this book to be very hard to follow and comprehend. The examples that are given are difficult to understand, and the text itself is extremely difficult to read and digest.For an introductory textbook, this book is very difficult to read and understand. I got very little out of reading it, and I sometimes found myself having more questions after reading the book than I did before. If you are a student that is required to use this book, I can only hope that you get more from it than I did."
5,"Heartfelt, sincere, inspirational","I laughed and I cried. What can I say? The stories touched me. They made me think; consider my place in this world and the next, but didn't condescend or preach. I felt as though I was in a dialogue with an adult.In tough times, this little text gave me pause. It helped me look at the bigger picture. I highly recommend it."
1,Way Over Priced and Misleading,"Pictures that accompanied the description led me to believe that I would be receiving three gaskets when only one came enclosed in a baggie. Looked like somebody opened a sealed package of three gaskets and sent me one of them. I have know idea how sanitary the product is, due to the mishandling of it.Do NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!"
2,Waste of Money,"My son absolutely LOVES Diego and I was looking a Rescue Pack for him for Christmas. He is 2 yrs old. This was the biggest waste of money. First of all, the backpack cant really be used as a backpack. The music it plays is way too loud. The stethoscope is awkward and difficult to use. My son only plays with the baby jaguar and the other baby animal that came in it. Don't waste your money!!"
3,It came to me not working at all :(,It did not work at all what a big let down for my lil man :( so unhappy with my toy....
4,Diego Rescue Pack,It would be better had it come w/ straps so that the child can actually wear it as well; otherwise it is a cute little toy for vivid imaginations to grow.
5,Gret movie,"We love watching movies on the weekends and this is such a good one, We enjoy watching it over and over."
1,Where's Hank and Lefty When You Need Them?,"After having forced myself to listen to this box-set, I think that garth has some of the most convoluted and fake songs that have ever been commited to record and his singing begs the question Where's Hank and Lefty when you need them? If this is what modern America calls great Country Music then give me a time machine cause I wanna go back."
2,Slips off the rings,"First, I know it says it doesn't guarantee an album color, but when I ordered I requested black or green and I got red and blue. Second, the pages slip off the rings when I turn the pages- even though I used about half of the pages so it's not too full."
2,Nice for the movie collector,"This is not a usable sword. This is for fans of the movie and to hang on the wall. There are very few swords that can be used, among these are Paul Chen's, Cold Steel's and the Last Legend stuff. Only buy this if you intend to put it on your wall because failure is not a possability it is guaranteed if you try to use this blade."
2,The toughest?,"I'm no super-brain, but I really expected more from this collection. The regular New York Times Sunday Crossword books are superior to this edition."
3,Don't get it if you're wanting a single song,"I bought this album because of the Wise Guys ""Start a Commotion"" from the Mistubishi commercial with an expectation to have a really cool song. The problem is that there is the ""hook"" with little other substance to this one track.On the other hand, for the virtue of the ""beat"" it is a pretty good album, just not much meat to grab unto."
4,good but could be cheaper.,"The product is pretty good, it was slightly expensive, but i have enjoyed using it, its all pretty simple and neat and works well. however you do have to purchase a 3.5mm jack seperately."
3,Sisman - Just Friends,"When you look at a novel like Just Friends, you know from the beginning what you're getting yourself into. What do you expect to happen when two close friends, one male, the other female, shack up with each other? Unfortunately, Just Friends didn't deliver on its promise...at least, until it was too late. There's always a certain amount of...what's the word...angst in friends-destined-to-be-lovers comedies like these. But because our future couple clearly wasn't even interested in one another until late in the novel, that angst was missing from the first three quarters of the book.That said, this was a well-written and amusing novel. The characters were well established and portrayed, dialog was crisp and realistic and the settings executed perfectly. Overall, Just Friends was a very entertaining read. Just a little light on the angst."
5,Excellent Heart Warming Story,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I was up till the wee hours of the night captivated by the tale and trying to figure out what would happen next. It made me laugh, cry, and shout aloud with the characters. Robyn Sisman did an excellent job with the characters. Well recommended."
2,It was ok.,"I liked this book in the end but it took me awhile to warm up to the two people in the story. The girl was a bit of a witch at times and the guy could be a real jerk. I thought she was kind of pushy and demanding. He was kind of shallow. But by the end, I did start to warm to them, but he did still continue to be a jerk. I think it was an ok book to read, but in the end I never fully came to like either one of them. I have read better chicklit."
5,A LAUGH OUT BOOK WITH SOME SPICY ROMANCE,This book about freya and her long time friend jack. freya likes to make herself needed so guys go for her and jack is an all lady man who goes for young girls and leaves them if things get out of hand. freya is just coming out of a friendship and goes to jack club and loses money and gets drunk and pass out. jack takes her in when she has nowhere to go but her pride hits in and tell him that she will pay to stay in his apartment. they get in each other nerves and they play tricks on each other. just as their getting along freya is invited to her half sister wedding and has to take someonw with her. jack agrees to go with her and thats when things get really heated up between both of them.........if you want to laugh at loud you have to read this.
5,"amazing! better than your every day chick lit!! (when i lend it out, i make sure i get it back...)","I could read this book a zillion times. its hilarious and you feel like freya is your best friend and you've known jack forever. ultimately, it is incredibly romantic because its real and progresses imperfectly.not just your every day chick lit! (not that there is anything wrong with that)"
1,Zoogster is a terrible company!!,they cancelled my order less than a week before halloween! They are totally unprofessional. They also did not answer my inquiries regarding my order. I would NOT recommend ordering from zoogster.
1,not made to withstand wind,"If you are going to use this tent on a windy day or in a windy area, you do not want to buy this. We put this up for our first time according to the instuctions. It almost blew away. We tied it down better and put more stakes in and the wind tore it to pieces."
2,I didn't care for this item,"The good things first, it was easy to set up, the walls are great with the windows (to bad they couldn't be unzipped). My experience with 10 to 15 mph winds was horrible. One of the poles bent and I can't seem to find another so it is no good"
1,Canopy Tent Gazebo,"Blew over in less than 2 min and broke. This is a very cheep and would never have someone purchase it. We replaced it for about the same price without sides from Dick's Sports in Ann Arbor. If you do purchase this one, get the weights for the legs b/c it is really flimsy."
1,Do not waste your money,Do not waste your money on this product. I wish I would have seen these reviews prior to my purchase. We put it up at an art fair this weekend and lost approximately $200 of merchandise as the rain came right through the fabric. You can see right through the fabric. My neighbor had a First Up from Walmart that was waterproof and we stood under her canopy. It was cheaper and I will be buying one from Walmart this week. I am disputing the charge with my credit card company.
4,not a bad deal!,"Sidewalls are a plus, with windows, even! Relatively light weight and easy, quick set-up. The only suspicious/weird part of the paperwork included a disclaimer stating that it is not advisable to use the tent outdoors in bright sunlight, rain, or wind. I did not purchase this thing so I could set it up in my living room! Have used it outside (no rain experience yet) and it's been fine! A very good deal for the price. Let's hope it does not melt in the rain."
4,disappointed in colour,the tent was extrememly easy to put up using two people. It would need extra securing in strong winds. The down side of our order was the colour - it arrived in blue instead of white and there was no time to exchange it before we needed it.Delivery was as promised
1,Worst purchase in my life!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! DO NOT BUY,"Not only did it take 4 people to set up, it took more rope and steaks that we had to buy because what came with it was a joke. All the joints were bowing and was FAR from sturdy. It leaks in rain like a lightweight t-shirt, it's not uv protected since I was sitting under it and got a nice tan. The Velcro for the sides ripped off 30 seconds after closing it for the first time. Seems inside the tent were falling apart when we took it out of the package. I was extremely disappointed I wasted my money because now that we used it once it's time for the dump."
3,"Nice idea, but problems unrolling","This review is coming to you from the Stanford University Sexual Health Peer Resource Center. While we stock the Beyond Seven line and they are quite popular, we've discovered that the aloe ones in particular are occasionally difficult to roll down all the way. The latex is sometimes rolled up into itself. I don't know if it's the aloe lube or something in the rolling during the manufacturing process, but one way or another, they sometimes take extra work to roll down. Any who use them should be particularly aware of this potential issue and be sure that they are rolled all the way down to the base of the penis, even if the condom seems to have reached its limit earlier."
3,Disappointing,"I bought this book to read J.M. story about Nicholas but was very disappointed, this could have been a great book. I would have really enjoyed reading a whole novel about him. I hope she one day writes the whole book I would totally buy it!"
4,Too short a story for Nicki !,"I love Nicki and he is the kindest and most atractive man in the Westmoreland stories,yet he only gets such a short story for himself! NOT FAIR! It proves that even the author thinks that the nice guy finishes last. In Whitney,My love and Until You,he is such a dear,he doesn't get the girl,yet in this SHORT story,he turns into the exact image of Clayton and Stephen,which means dark,cynical,cruel and untrusting,he gets the girl! I want a full length novel on Nicki,and he should be at least a bit different from the Westmoreland brothers after all that happened! For some reasons I still think that Whitney should end up in Nicki's arms. Nicki is so much more lovable than Clayton!"
4,Where's the Full Book on Poor Nicki?,I read all of her novels and I love the historical ones. I came across this short story and could have sworn that it a regular full size novel. After a year of searching and trying to remember the name of the book i just now discover that it was only a short story. I must say I am most disappointed. He deserves no less than that after all he has done. I hope to see something in the future.
3,Not the end of the world,"Like the others here, I bought this book in order to find out what will happen to Nikki, and like them I agree that both he and Julianna deserve a full novel (and a little spice would not be amiss). This is a well written outline. I hope someday to see it completed."
1,yikes - was this made in the 80's - steer clear of this one if you are serious about learning how to train your dog,"the training dvd was so bad that at one point i thought it was a joke - like a saturday night live skit. very stiff, very amateur. i was expecting a dvd to help me train! i literally threw it away after watching it."
5,Pure satisfaction!,"The first time I heard Marcos Valle was on Radio Monte-Carlo in Milan. Finally I found what I've been looking for when it comes to Brazilian smooth popmusic. I was happy to get this CD from Amazon.com. All the 10 songs are wonderful. So mellow, tender, silky. If you're addicted to Brazilian music, like Tom Jobim, Joao Gilberto etc, you'll love this one. This one brings joy!"
2,"Tommy, why?","I am a big fan of Tomomy Lee Jones, so my question to him is: : ""WhY?"" Why make this movie, were you bored, needed the work, what? Awful movie, story was stupid, acting terrible, (Sorry, Tommy, even yours) Waste of time. I know your from Texas Tommy, but as a fellow Texan, once again: Why?"
4,Man of the House,Worth seeing for the fact that Tommy Lee Jones and Cedric the Entertainer are in it. Hilarious. Also FYI I was amazed (none of the girls had dance or cheerleading previously) - they all did great!
4,Mardis Gras CD,"We heard this song on the radio and had to have it. Being in South MS, Mardis Gras is a Major holiday and any unusual music is a big hit. We were in our first parade this year and this CD was a lot of fun. It didn't win any Grammys for obvious reasons, but the songs are cute."
5,Amazing quality,"For an inexpensive guitar, this model sure has some nice features. Tone is great, electronics are solid, and a joy to play. If you are looking for a great first electric, this one deserves your consideration."
2,guitar great but vocally challenged,"I love woman blues (and men too) and I have had a women compilation blues cd for several years. Recently I started purchasing some of these lady's cds and have been pleased with all that Ive purchased EXCEPT this one. Yep she sure can play guitar but I kept wondering if her singing would change at some point. Man, for me her voice is just above tolerable..."
2,A hot mess.....,"This was my first Stella Cameron book, and although I had thought it my last, maybe not. Some of the other reviews list other books that might be better, according to the reviewers. The only reason I finished this book was that I was ill and it was my last library book! Otherwise, I found it lacking in character development, alluding to past occurences but not fleshing them out at all. Key characters, such as Lil, are dropped in the middle of scenes to mess things up with no real explanation as to why they're there or who they are. Bobby Colbert shows up as a red herring and is dropped midway through the book with no explanation. Cyrus (the priest) and Madge (his assistant) are wandering through the book with hints as to a platonic love affair between them, but the thread is never wrapped up. Awkwardly written, confusing subplots, and a really silly, boring ending. Truly disappointing."
1,Doesn't work well,The person I was speaking to said that I sounded distant. He/she would ask me to callusing a different headset.
1,I would never buy this product again,"The sound quality for the other end is terrible, so I cannot use this anymore. Every time I use the headset I get a complaint from the person on the other end that they cannot hear me."
5,Used Plantronics headsets for years!,"I wanted a headset for my home phone and spent TONS of time buying headsets at the store and then ""testing"" them by calling my mom to see if she could hear me well, and if I could hear her well. After MANY attempts and wasted time going back and forth from the stores, I found these on Amazon! Inexpensive, they hold up pretty well, and I don't sound like I am talking through a tunnel to other people. Most of the time, they last around a year for me (and I only answer the phone with the headset plugged in so I can continue moving around hands free on the phone.)"
5,A stroke of genius,"This CD is the most creative release to hit the shelves yet this year. Spy sounds like Beck after watching too many 60's flicks, strumming an electric guitar, and taking vocal lessons. The man behind Spy, Joshua Ralph, not only sings but also plays electric guitar, upright bass, bass guitar, drums, and synthesiser. A few of the songs (Baby, Wanderer, Fire it up) sound like a combination of disco and good ol' rock and roll. Others, (Leave me alone, Stay away) mix rap beats and orchestral as well as latin pieces to create a unique sound. Ever heard spanish meriachi strings and a gospel choir in the same song? And the instrumental pieces sound like the perfect score to a 60's movie. Oh, and Ralph throws in a little bluegrass, country, and a full orchestral piece. Anyone who is looking for something fresh and different must pick up this LP."
5,Amazingly Diverse..something for everyone!,"I had the pleasure of previewing this cd before it came out. Listen to ""Wonderer"" it is an amazing piece of work. What can I say...a true music genious."
3,NOT TOO HAPPY,"THEY WERE VERY UNCOMFORTABLE,ITS WAS GIVEN TO ONE OF MY BOYS.ALSO I ORDERED A PAIR OF REEF SANDLES WHITE WITH A BIT OF GOLD AND NEVER RECEIVED THEM IT WAS ALSO DONE WITH MY SAME CREDIT CARD THE SAME DAY,THAT WAS ONE OF THE MAIN ITEMS I TRULLY WANTED AND WAITING FOR THEM IN THE MAIL, COUNTING THE DAYS I WOULD RECEIVE IT AND ALL I RECEIVE WERE THE REEBOKS IM VERY UNHAPPY WITH THAT. UBELEIVABLE BECAUSE I DYING TO HAVE THE REEFS BECAUSE I COULD NOT FIND THAT COLOR IN STORES ANYMORE,AND WAS SO HAPPY TO FIND THEM IN ON AMAZON FOR MY SIZE AN 8.BUT SO MUCH FOR THAT NEVER RECEIVED THEM,MY HOPES WENT DOWN THE DRAIN.STILL SEARCHING AROUND BUT NEVER RECEIVED MY REFUND ON THE OR A RESPONCE WHY I DID NOT RECEIVE THEM WITH MY OTHER SANDLES AT THE SAME TIME....SIGNED UNHAPPY AND NOT SATISFIED."
3,"for travellers, maybe.","i'd have to agree that this lil package would be great for the frequent traveller who wants to able to play the songs on their ipod just about everywhere they go. it's convenient and good size for portability, can be battery operated, has a remote control, etc..if, however, like me you are looking for a sound system that will accomodate your ipod at home i.e. a personal stereo, then this is not the best bet. the sound is very 'tinny'. small speakers = small sound. you're probably even better off using computer speakers to play your music.my advice: save a few more bucks and get the bose sounddock instead."
4,The person I bought it for seemed happy,I did as much as I could to find a good speaker system for an IPOD with a budget in mind. I have Altec speakers for my PC and I love them. It was a gift so I can not give first hand input.Sorry !
1,just a reply,Just commenting something Brian Cates said: the US Marines only promote world peace if your world is called USA.
5,Comeback of the Year,"This has to be the comeback of the year. A gorgeous, heartfelt record. Even more so when you consider the fact that Ian wrote these songs for his wife after he was unfaithful. Maybe their best."
1,Save your money,"It worked great, for a few weeks. Now it just does whatever it wants to do. A piece of junk. I also got a pair of bag gloves from Everlast (they should throw an 'N' at the beginning of that) that fell apart after two workouts (even my inflated sense of self refuses to believe I hit that hard)."
1,Better to spend the money on hamburgers,"The idea was good, but Everlast failed in the execution. The bell is so low you cannot hear it, and the vibration feature is so weak, you cannot feel it unless you're holding it in your palm. I'll probably try a timer from another manufacturer. I assume that Everlast has different lines of products for people that are in the business of boxing, because what they sell to average consumers is of poor quality, including their corny DVDs."
2,Hard to see,"This timer works great and is easy to use, but it's impossible to read the numbers head on... you have to tilt the timer to a funny angle in order to see how much time is left. Annoying. But other than that it works great."
1,waste of money,Not well made at all and only works half the time; and the programming changes on its own. I recommend spending a little more for a better piece. Don't waste money on this one.
1,Piece of Crap,"What a total waste of money!! I bought 2, one for me and one for another personal trainer. Mine stopped working the FIRST day. The LCD screen would randomly shut off. Luckily, I was able to return the other one because I didn't open it. After replacing the batteries twice (thinking that was the problem), it sill doesn't turn on. It is now part of a landfill. Gymboss Interval Trainer is what I purchased and is awesome! Spend the few extra bucks."
1,"Worked 1 time, then quit","Wish I'd seen these reviews before I bought it. Just like everyone says, it worked for a while, then did random things for a while, then stopped working completely. For me, it only worked properly on the first time I tried to use it. Then the next time it wouldn't let me adjust the number of rounds. Then it wouldn't turn on, and I messed with it until the display come on, but couldn't get it to work. Then it never turned on again. I tried replacing the batteries, no luck."
4,boxing timer,I has adequate settings and is practical. It is the best way to go without the purchase of an offical timer.
4,Affordable timer,"This compact timer does just the trick for a personal workout. It comes with batteries and the bell is quite loud. You can easily program it for the length of the round and breaks in between. Initially when I received it, it was defective, but Amazon quickly replaced it and it works great. For the price it is a great bargain compared to the $100+ timers that are purchased by gyms and boxing programs. I would recommend this for home use or even when hitting the bag at your local gym."
3,You get what you pay for...,"It's cheap, and it feels cheap.My first and greatest gripe is the way this thing marks the rounds -- ie, with a bell instead of a standard beep. I'm not huge on appearances, and I don't mind looking a little foolish if it means I get a little better, but I honestly feel like such n00bsauce with this dinging bell thing going off in the middle of an MMA gym full of Muay Thai, MMA , and Jiu-Jitsu fighters of a more serious persuasion. It makes me wish there were a silent vibrate function, and I definately don't feel like bringing this to Marine Corps groundfighting or martial arts training sessions because of how annoying the thing sounds.It doesn't tell you what round you're actually on, it just tells you how many rounds you originally set it to.I'll only be using this at home and shadowboxing in the mirror, and I'll just use my gym's timer for work at the gym, k thx."
4,vibrate mode,"Its a great portable timer but I was disappointed that the vibrate mode does not turn off the obnoxious bell sound. You would assume they would be two separate modes like on a cell phone but when I used the vibrate, the bell kept ringing with it."
4,Kelley is Kim's equal...really!,"Okay...so perhaps Kelley's not the musician that Kim is. And Kim has a certain air about her that seems to infuse the personalities of people who are ""stars"" that Kelley somehow doesn't seem to possess. (Though if you've ever seen the Deal sisters on stage you know that Kelley can hold her own with Kim when it comes to presence.) Other than that, I actually think Kelley's every bit her twin sister's rival when it comes to songwriting and singing (of course, her vocal is close to identical to her more famous sister's). I have to say that I like the KD 6000 records as much as the Breeders records, other than I suppose Pod, which is a masterpiece of '90s alternative rock. Both KD 6000 collections are definitely worth buying."
4,Kelley Deal 6000 - 'Go To The Sugar Alter' (Red Ink Records),"Worthy post-Breeders effort from guitarist / vocalist Kelley Deal - of course Kim Deal's younger sister. Never got to see The Breeders but I saw The KD6K as some would call them a year after this CD hit the streets. Tracks that make this disc (at least) a should-have are ""How About Hero"", the low-key ""Sugar"", ""Head Of The Cult"", the beautifully done ""Nice"" and ""Marooned"". Best described as '90's indie alternative. Recommended for fans of Dinosaur Jr., Afghan Whigs and Mudhoney."
3,This is a re-issue,this is a reissue of a 1994 pressing by Nightingale with the same singers-the original 1994 CD set is much cheaper to purchase.
2,Metal this is not,"Reading the other reviews, most of which are quite inaccurate, I decided to place my own opinion on this disc. This album is most definatly NOT metal of any sort. I have heard comparisons to Iced Earth and Blind Guardian and have no idea what these people are talking about. The first track, ""Destiny"" is decent, but from there everything is downhill. This music reminds me of a bad Journey or Kansas, not power metal like Iced Earth. The ""hard"" songs sound like cheap 80's hair band riffs with sub-par soft rock lyrics. The ballads are poorly written with no lyrical quality. In short, avoid this album unless you are a hardcore fan of soft rock like Journey, Kansas or Styx. They sound nothing like any metal I have heard, and if you are looking for power metal get Iced Earth's ""Something Wicked This Way Comes"" or ""The Dark Saga"", not Stratovarius' ""Destiny""."
2,No money at all,"This is called a money pocket chart, but there is no money at all, and there is only one pocket. This is a small poster to hang on the wall with Velcro. You must put velcro onto the back of whatever you want to stick onto it. Not very useful."
4,a valued product for your car,The filter is really worth a try. Very well priced & easy to install.The filter will also get rid of requiremnt of changing air filters after every couple of Kms.
4,Maybe a little too cute for it's own good,"I love this book, with it's short and easy to read vignettes about a wide variety of films, actors and subjects within the Film Noir genre. The pictures are great, and all the salacious details are served up. However, sometimes the prose runs to ""too cute""; a little too impressed with it's own smirky coyness. Needless to say, many subjects are not explored in any kind of depth. Other than that, it's a great introduction and contains a wealth of details about my very favorite subject."
2,All flash--a Tommy gun full of blanks,"I will grant that film noir is mostly about style, that's film noir the thing in itself, not the explanation. Muller tries to write like the hard-boiled wordsmiths that helped give noir its flavor; but he adds so much useless patter as to give the impression that, like them, he is being paid by the word. In the end this book is about as satisfying as getting nicotine from a patch. The two stars are for the pictures."
2,Bad adhesive on labels,"Somehow, the labels on the parts are so tight, you almost have to scrape them off and in the process, even when removing with fingernails you gouge the wood and in some places remove the finish. I would not buy things from this company again and would appreciate not having to deal with a company rep asking me to change my review as happened with the last time I submitted."
2,rainbow boys got rained all over,"picked up the book because of the photographer who did the cover and ended up reading it.i don't regret it but i don't recommend it either. mr. sanchez's first novel ( written 12 years ago )treated the subject like an abc family after school special to be watched by junior high schoolers in the1980's.times have changed so much that the book can not sustain the reality of the facts and the mental level ofnowadays teens' issues.mr.sanchez really generalized, stereotyped and [ i am sure ] fantasized his writing through this book somuch that his prose just collapsed. his book was so expected and contrived that it left me empty thinking.maybe mr. sanchez's , who i believe wrote the Rainbow Boys' Nelson's flaming character based on himself,newest books are better written and updated to any level of any matter the man decided to put histhoughts to work."
5,Great reading for all ages.,"I have read all three of the books in the triology and couldn't put any of them down.While this book is written for teens, as a gay male in my 40s I really enjoyed Alex Sanchez's book. The books deal with coming out as a teen very well and I like that he shows three teens that come from different backgrounds as far as how their parents accept their homosexuality and deal with it.I wish I would have Alex's book available for reading when I was in high school. All his books should be in every high school library."
3,MGM'S APACHE,"GREAT COLOR...STORY, ETC...IT'S A SHAME MGM DID NOT RELEASED IT IN ITS CORRECT THEATER FORMAT VERSION...."
5,remarkable young girl,"this girl is just remarkable in the work she does, I could not believe the great talent that she puts forth in this book.... To be able to paint this beautiful and help people in the world while doing this is truly a special gift... thank you for your work Amanda.."
4,Exciting Adventure,"My paperback mysteriously disappeared ages ago-- I'm so glad to see the book is back in print, in several editions! Not only is MICHAEL STROGOFF one of Jules Verne's least-known books, it also spawned one of the least-known Jules Verne film adaptations! Seek out if you can, from 1937, SOLDIER AND THE LADY, starring Anton Walbrook (the hero), Akim Tamiroff (the villain!) and Ed Brophy (the comic-relief newspaper-reporter). It feels like a Disney ""adventure"" film decades before Disney started doing them!"
4,Perfect for our needs!,"The ONE hassle with this stroller is the non-swiveling front wheel. My husband really wanted the straight wheel, but it bugs me a little bit.The great things: the adjustable seat back, the completely adjustable visor (can block out sun or wind or rain), and the simple design. It's a great basic stroller with a smooth ride."
3,how will i ever know,Who knows if this stuff worked. I guess if the turds dont come out my shower in the next year or two its great stuff?
3,"Not so great foe ""heavy"" root blockage.","I slplit this into 3 treatments(1x a week) & I'm shocked that it didn't help the pipe outflow much. The last time I used this product 3 -4 Yrs ago(for $8 mind you from my local hardware store) I had way better results. They don't sell it in Ca. anymore so I looked online. I Even put 2 heaping tbl. in with 1/2 gal of water,crawled under the house & dumped it around the problem area.(Pomogranate. tree roots leaching into a section of old piping). When I did this last time IN Conjunction with flushing down the toilet it worked great but not this time.bummer!"
4,"Strong start, slow finish--Overall excellent job!","Ofra returns to her Israeli roots with this 1987 recording of folksongs. At the helm is fellow Yemenite, Benny Nagari, whose strong percussion-influenced arrangements evoke a similar feel to their prior 1985 collaboration, ""Yemenite Songs"". The first cut, ""A Night in Canaan"" starts with Ofra singing a capella accompanied by a few wistful notes on the keyboards, which erupts into a powerfully orchestrated chorus at each interval. A true delight to the senses. Each song truly boasts stunning arrangements and instrumentation with Ofra's voice figuring among the most powerful and sweetly sentimental of all the instruments. The last two songs end the album on a rather mellow tone but still leave you wanting more and more. A fantastic job featuring some incredible musicians: Iki levi on percussion, Benny Nagari on Synthesizers and a rare duet with Yehudit Ravitz on ""The Flute""."
2,"Ordered a Tote Bag, received a messenger bag with a defect","I ordered the Tote bag and received a messenger bag with a small tear on the handle. I am very disappointed with the bag that I received, if I wanted a messenger bag I would have order one."
3,thin tote bag,"It was okay if I was purseless, but this thing wasn't attractive at all, and it looked like something I sewed together, and I can't sew.It was okay. I've going to give it to the Salvation Army. Maybe they can use it. Thank you!"
2,Why did they bother?,"This must have been fun to record but it feels to me like they were just having a lark w/country music. As a result, it's competently performed, but bland in a sort of Country Lite kind of way. When famous musicians cross genres, it's more rewarding when they at least bring us something new, or dive in w/both feet and give us the texture of the new genre--I was looking forward to something more. Instead, it's like hearing a good country cover band in a Las Vegas lounge (nothing wrong w/that, but at least in Vegas the music is free).There are many better country or folk or bluegrass albums on the market right now that are more rewarding than this. Start with, say, ""You Don't Know Me - Songs of Cindy Walker,"" just released by Willie Nelson, a better example of how to do a tribute album."
2,Ridiculous,"Hey folks, look! It's Scooby Doo meets CSI in the FOURTEENTH century! A traveling band of actors decides to investigate a murder??? Its the dark ages, but a one-man exhumation (in frozen ground, no less!) is performed along with a rudimentary autopsy and the details of rigor mortis are common knowledge! wow, what history books did these guys read? The production design and costumes were well done - outside of that, give me a break. No attempt was made to make the dialogue sound even remotely accurate for the times, and the pacing was tediously slow. Not a good flick overall."
5,Amazing!,I really love this shimmer brick as it highlights and gives the most glowy finish to my cheekbones. The color bars can also be used as eyeshadows. Amazing product.
4,Love this product + shipped faster than i expected!,Im very happy i got this! I love Bobbi Brown makeup and this seller delivered before estimate and in perfect condition!
4,"Well-written, engrossing mystery thriller","I've now read almost all the Nina Reilly books, and I do recommend them to anyone who likes a good mystery thriller. There is always enough in these books to keep you guessing, with plenty of false leads and plot twists and turns. The authors almost always make some factual and legal mistakes (as a lawyer I spot the legal mistakes; as a car buff I spot the automotive ones; and as a reader I spot occasional inconsistencies from chapter to chapter), so I can't say these books are perfectly edited. The action is intermittent but sufficient to keep my interest. But the best thing I can say is that the plots are intricate and interesting, and the dialogue and characters are quite believable. Well worth trying out."
1,"Answers to questions we were too shy to ask, A Great Gift.","A wonderfully accessible book, with a wealth of topics, resources, and ideas for all Americans. A great gift book, inspiring and fun to read. Short chapters, internet sites, phone numbers, addresses, historic information as well as current listings for reaching our public representatives.In one simple book here are the answers to those most frequently thought of questions....questions we were too shy to ask.This is the handy passport to being an informed, intelligent and up to date American: who to call, where to write to, what to know, and what to do. I highly recommend having several around. People keep borrowing it to read!!"
1,No STRs makes this useless to Real Estate/Surveying Industry,"I just bought the 5th edition of this Delorme Florida Atlas. However, the Florida atlas does not include the Section, Township, & Range system that Florida County parcel # real estate legal descriptions are based on thus making this atlas useless to the real estate/surveying/flood zone determination industry.The Section, Township, & Range system is especially useful when you are dealing with new construction that aren't on any maps yet, or with incorrect/incomplete addresses. With the STR system you can get the location narrowed down to a one square mile area.This lack of STRs was surprising to me because I recently purchased a Wisconsin Atlas by Delorme that had STRs in it & it was very useful.This was a major mistake/oversight on the part of Delorme & I am returning my copy to the map store tommorrow. Hopefully, they will correct this error in the sixth edition."
5,Very provocative; excellent place to begin study of the mind,"To a general reader with no background in neuroscience, I recommend this book as an excellent jumping-off point. Pinker's model of the mind is intuitively appealing, but more importantly, is backed up by exhaustive references. His style is also excellent.Many of the conclusions presented by Pinker are un-PC and therefore sure to draw fire. He presents strong evidence that Piaget was a Lamarkian, and asserts that the lack of success associated with constructivist learing (Whole Language, ""New-New Math"") is nothing more than the inevitable result of wrong theory. Be suspicious of those who slam-dunk the work; read Pinker, check out some of the alternative theories, and draw your own conclusions."
2,"Amusing, Decent","Not the revelation that I hoped for, but an amusing read. For a layman, this is a good overview of psychology, with bits of evolution and other topics thrown in. I was disappointed with how Pinker belabored the dry comparison between the mind and a computer. That should have been 1/4 as long. I skipped on to the next section, and didn't feel I lost anything.I'd recommend this for someone who is a casual reader of the sciences."
2,Well written hand waving,"This book is well written. But without reference to specific neural structures in his reverse engineered brain, it is difficult to really take seriously."
3,Boggy,Still reading this book. I read a chapter here and there. It's a big boggy and not an entertaining read at all. Good information though.
3,dense read,"this was the first book of steven pinker's that i've read. it was very interesting at times, but the material was a bit too dense in some parts. it was difficult to glean a point very easily. and not all of the diagrams were helpful in elucidating whatever the text was trying to say. it was an okay, long, read. nevertheless, that hasnt discouraged me from tackling pinker's ""the language instinct"" next."
3,"Good stuff, too long!","Some interesting and thought provoking parts, but could have been written better (Shorter). I thought he was going to pull together (ya know- synthesize) many of the ideas at the end. He doesn't (or maybe I was sleeping during that part). Pinker occasionally writes at great length about ""accepted"" ideas, and then passes right over those that are more complex and questionable. That is frustrating and so is his ""humor"". Would I recommend this book to a friend? Probably not."
3,"Great title but a long, bland book.","Oatmeal. After reading along patiently for a certain distance you begin to realize the author is not, after all, ever going to tell you how the mind works. On this same general subject I thought The Prehistory of the Mind, by Steven Mithun, was more fun and had some turns and surprises."
3,"Warm, fuzzy linguistics","Yes, the human mind is a marvelous organ, surpassing all mechanical models that try to emulate its computational, creative, problem-solving genius. And its evolution is one, thanks to Pinker's lucid prose and familiar illustrations, we can appreciate and marvel at. But the question of how we can make our evolved minds better, not to mention prevent them from getting worse, is one Pinker's work persistently overlooks. Understandably, Pinker's sanguine style and fundamental optimism are received well by numerous readers, but if a mapping of the human mind becomes so broad it fails address the pot-holes and shifting grounds upon which the journey is made, its usefulness becomes dubious. Perhaps it's time for linguistics to move beyond its academic complacency into the realm of cultural criticism and the influence of the postmodern landscape on human consciousness."
2,hatemongering at its finest,"I think this book is extremely pretentious, and only serves to pour salt in the wounds of resentment between East Asians and Westerners. The point of this book seems to be how David Mura decided to give the whole white race the middle finger, as a result of rediscovering his roots.As a white American who has devoted his college education to the study of two East Asian languages, and has come to have a lot of respect for various facets of Chinese and Japanese cultures, this book makes me sick. I think Eastern people and Western people have a lot they can learn from each other, and in the shrinking world of tomorrow, we'll have no choice but to coexist harmoniously. Books like Mura's only sow seeds of resentment and racism. A search for identity is one thing, but this guy has a few axes to grind.Plus, he isn't a very articulate writer. I can't count the number of purple-prose sentences of his I had to reread before I understood what the heck he was trying to say."
2,not quit up to snuff,"Got the scale on time and in good condition. It was very difficult to get a consistent reading. If i moved on thescale, (shifterd weight), the weight would change up to 5 pounds. Sent it back."
1,Inaccurate and incosistent,If you step on and step off this scale 3 times you will get 3 different weights. And I don't mean a pound or two. I had differences as much as 9 pounds! Back to digital for me.
5,Great Mechanical Scale,"Love my new scale, large numbers in lbs/oz and kg/g.This scale is better over the digital scales becauseit works on carpeted surfaces,unlike digital scales we'vehad in the past. Great scale."
4,Well built scale,"I purchased the scale, and the original one was stuck at 110 lbs. This was my first experience with a problem on something I bought from Amazon. I was delighted with the service. They immediatly shipped me a new scale, and a label for returning the 1st one, everything free of charge.The new scale seems fairly well built, has consistant readings and is easy to see. I would highly recommend this product."
4,Great Scale,"Step on any number of digital scales, and you'll get any number of digital readings. Which one is accurate? Try calibrating a digital scale. The Salter 200 is very easy to calibrate using the wheel under the bezel, and the large dial is easy to read with out bending over. The original reason I purchased this scale is it's the same one used by my doctor. Why only four stars? I wouldn't want the Salter people to stop trying! If your serious about monitoring your weight this product will not disappoint."
5,Bakers Bliss,Excellent recipes. Authentic and informative. It lives up to its title. I look forward to making many more of the recipes over the up coming holidays!
1,Boring,"Salvatore has some great works but this is definitely his worst book ever. The whole trilogy is pointless, it is just a series of repetitive boring battles in which Drizzt & friends will clearly not die. Every little piece of dialogue is cliché and all the characters speak for the author instead of themselves. They never disagree, they have no personality.The book is BORING. The battles are BORING. It goes NOWHERE. It means NOTHING."
2,Boring!!!,"I'm really surprised to see all the positive reviews for this book. I am a big fan of the Drizzt series but this one is disappointing. What little bit of story advancement was covered could have filled a comic book. Everything else was all filler. It was one confrontation description after another. Never getting to the story telling. Salvatore must have signed a three book contract and needed to fill some pages. The constant woe-is-me musings of Drizzt grew old quickly. I understand he is upset about the apparent death of his friends, but page after page every other chapter is cheap writing. The book is slow and a far cry from what is expected from a usually fine author."
3,watch box,The box looks elegant until you try the key to lock the box. Unable to fit because the keyhole is misaligned and cheaply put together. Fortunately I don't need to lock the watches.
4,Good but this much of a change seems to quick,"I really liked this album a lot, but it's very different from their first album. This isn't a bad thing, I'm all for bands changing and evolving. But their first album was a lot more ""poppy"" very much in the sprit of The Ramones and this new album as a faster, loud sound to it. Which is good but I just wish it was a bit more like the first one. This much of a change seems to fast. Don't get me wrong I REALLY liked this cd alot, and on some levels it's actually better than the first. Im just saying if they wanted to go in this direction they should have had a ""transition"" album. In my opinion this album should have been their 3rd album. But regardless, The Lillingtons is a promising band that I hope to see more from for years to come! ""GOD BLESS RAMONES STYLE PUNK!"" P.S. If you like these guys I also recommend The Apers"
2,Is this the new Screeching Weasel CD?,"This band was one of the most promising pop-punk bands out there until Ben Weasel got his hands on them and totally [destroyed] their sound. Kody's voice was the highlight of the band and Weasel has brought the Weasel-esque guitar sound to the forefront and the vocals to the background. This RUINED the original unique sound that made the Lillingtons so great. This CD is average at best. The Lillingtons would be better served to go back to Joe Queer as producer.If you can find ""Idiot Word Search"" (a split with Nothing Cool), **** Out Of Luck, or any of their 7"", BUY THEM INSTEAD!"
4,Pink Floyd fanatic from Fla,"On almost every Pink FLoyd poll I have seen, this album takes in the most votes for being the worst album Pink Floyd ever produced. Don't believe them! This album packs a powerful punch, displaying Rogers' clear antipathy towards war, probably stemming from the his father's death due to war. The music on the album ranges from the slow, teary eyed ""The Gunner's Dream"" to fast the fast paced ""Not Now John"". It takes a serious subject and turns it into something you can put in your stereo and jam out to."
5,Brilliantly written Falklands War commentary,"Pink FloydThe Final Cut (1983)Having already make their masterful album The Wall, which was partly about the insanity of War and the insanity that it breeds, they return to the subject on the occasion of the recent Falkland War.The Falkland War was fought in 1982 between The United Kingdom and Argentina in a sovereignty dispute over the Falkland Islands and the South Georgia and South Sandwich Islands, which are located just east of Argentina.Roger Waters saw that war as an futile attempt by the U.K. to keep the last bits of a kingdom where ""the sun never sets"", no matter how useless those bits of land may be to the U.K. As a commentary on that War, with several references back to The Wall, this is a brilliantly written and executed album. This is a Five Star album."
2,Not a very great album....,HelloThis is not what i expected. Not Now John is a clasic. The rest of the tracks are just OK.
2,At least The Wall and Animals have music.,"If you want to hear Roger Waters talk for 40 mins, buy this. If you want to hear Pink Floyd, buy any other Pink Floyd album."
3,Only Pros and Cons was better(In the post Wall catagory),"This album is awsome. It's lyrics are actually meningful and the rhythem and melodies by the bass and keyboards are good. The gilmore solos (though there are a few) are superb and the heart thumping of the drums mixes well. Though the creativity of the band is not much Roger Waters is the best lyricist.If only Gilmore and Waters were to come back together, then we might have something like this, and more..."
2,Not now John!,"The follow-up to ""The Wall"", ""The Final Cut"" is, when considered with its predecessor, a musical let-down. It's also without Pink Floyd's keyboardest, Wright, who was kicked out of the band at this time.I've seen the limited video EP that accompanied this album and putting pictures to the music doesn't add to it.I am a Pink Floyd fan (Meddle is my favourite album; so I guess I prefer their earlier stuff)."
4,Seriously underrated (4.5 stars),"This is possibly the most underrated album Floyd ever released next to ""Animals"" and ""Atom Heart Mother"". Many fans criticize harshly on this album, but there is nothing wrong with it. The lyrics are amazing, the melodies are catching, and the atmosphere is dark and gloomy. It's one of Floyd's most somber, low-key albums as well. It is true that it is more of a Waters' solo album, but just look at what one of the reviewers in the spotlight section said, ""A Momentary Lapse of Reason"", the next album, is sort of a Gilmour solo album.Gilmour was a great musician and singer, but Waters carried the foundation. With the exception of ""The Division Bell"", Floyd wasn't all that great with just Gilmour at the helm..."
1,"right group, wrong album","The CD came quickly and looked like new all wrapped up, but instead of ""The Final Cut"" it was ""Amused to Death"", which would not have been so bad if I didn't already have that CD. I will not deal with them again."
3,Finalized,"With some exceptionally stand out moments throughout. When this first came out and of course a lot of us bought it on the tail of The Wall.The subject matter of most songs does give you the impression these are left over from The Wall. Here it is 30+ years later and probably that long since I've listened to The Final Cut.Absolutely fantastic album, guess I was just a bit snobbish in those days getting into bands like Iron Maiden, etc. What do stand out are Waters using the backup singers from his future projects.Guess it took all these years for me to add The Final Cut to be listed with the other ones Meddle, Dark Side, Wish You Were, Animals, The Wall as their greatest period."
1,"""Final Cut"" is the final straw.","I'm a loyal Floyd fan since I first stumbled onto them in the early '70's, but ""Final Cut"" is an awful piece of work. Compared to every other Pink floyd album out there, this one is the weakest.Yes, it's subjective, so humblest apoligies to those who find it worthwhile. Personally, it's a lot of noise. If you want to introduce yourself to Pink Floyd, pick any one of their other works. Purchase this album only if you need it to complete your Floyd collection. This does not change the fact that Pink floyd is one of the greatest bands of all time, but they sure laid an egg with ""Final Cut""."
3,Uncomfortably Numb,"I won't pretend to be objective here: I never enjoyed this album. Beautifully produced, relentlessly downbeat and funereal. I first heard it at a college record store (Cutlers, Yale) broadcast on its official release date by WAVZ [WDRC?] packed with PF fans. By 10 minutes into the album, most simply scratched their heads and wandered out, profoundly disappointed. It was like listening to Side 3 of The Wall without the two great bookend pieces, Hey You and Comfortably Numb.I've read in other sources that much if not most of FC is a compilation of songs that didn't make it into The Wall - and if they had, I doubt Wall would have been such a triumph. FC's lyrics are very dated, and there's little to relate to. Would've been much more honest if this were released as a Waters solo album."
3,Sub-The Wall,"Come on, guys... this record doesn't have Wright, and Gilmour and Mason didn't work a lot on it... only Waters. He's a genius, but this is a self-indulgent record. Of course, there are pretty good songs: ""Not Now John"" (Gilmour's vocals are amazing), ""Gunner's Dream"", ""Your Possible Pasts"". But nothing compared with ""The Wall"" or early works such ""Ummagumma"" or AHM."
2,Pink Floyd - 'The Final Cut' (Columbia),"Review no. 246. Band's 12th proper album, also the Gilmour, Waters, Wright and Mason line-up sawnsong release. Long awaited follow-up for 'The Wall'. Personally, I never cared much for this Floyd effort because I've always felt it was Pink Floyd in name only - certainly not spirit, vibe or musically. Even though the playing on this record is so-so, the only songs I sort of liked were ""Your Possible Pasts"" and the radio-friendly (over-played, at the time) ""Not Now, John"". Rest assure, the band's two CD reissues several years later 'Momentary Lapse Of Reason' ('87) and especially 'The Division Bell' ('94) are much better."
5,Get Your Filthy Hands Off My Mama?,"I don't know why I made that my title...whatever. People give The Final Cut a hard time. They claim that it's not really Pink Floyd, but a Roger Waters solo album. Who cares?! This is really good, and definitely one of my favorites. As a precaution though, you can't listen to the songs seperately (except for maybe Not Now John and When The Tigers Broke Free). The album really acts as one long song that must be taken together. The addition of When The Tigers was a good decision. It's just plain cool - completely orchestrated with chorus and the like. Also, I'm not big on profanity. I really don't like it much at all. But Not Now John has to be my favorite on the album, and one of my favorite Pink Floyd songs (it uses the...""f word""...quite a bit). Anyways, ignore the complaints of the bitter PF fans who say don't get it becasue it's not really Pink Floyd."
4,might as well been rogers first solo album,"I for one like this album,but I'm a fan of rogers solo work.If your expecting to hear typical Floyd,your going to bedisappointed.Many people like to think that this was part 2 of The Wall; which in a few ways, it was.But for the mostpart, was rogers use of many studio musicians and studio toys.Richard wright isn't on the album;after being asked toleave the band after the wall was finished,and there is very little sounds from David and nick.If you like solowaters, you'll probably dig this."
1,The only CUT from this should have been Roger,"It seems that Roger Waters's only goal with thisalbum was to alienate all of the Pink Floyd fans,knowing that the group with him was done. It isobvious that his attempt failed. With the release ofMomentary Lapse of Reason, The Division Bell, DelicateSound of Thunder and Pulse it shows that Pink Floyd can survivewithout Roger Waters and after hearing what Roger Watershas done on his own it shows that HE is not surviving very well without Floyd. This album is for the most part a Waters effort and a disgrace to the Pink Floyd name. DO NOT waste your moneyon this GARBAGE even to complete your Floyd catalog.I can see why David Gilmour had his name removed from theproduction credits. It is very very clear that Gilmour wasthe true heart and soul of the real Pink Floyd."
2,horrible,i saw this at the theatre and it was horrible. i almost feel asleep cause it was so boring. stick to the older eddie murphy films like beverly hills cop and 48 hrs.
5,There's Only One Woman for Him . . .,"Wes Craven directed this movie starring Eddie Murphy and Angela Bassett. Eddie Murphy is a perfect, suave, vampire from the old country looking for his soul mate . . . the one woman in the world whose father was a vampire. There's a lot of humor and yet a lot of depth in this movie."
4,The funniest Vampire spoof I've ever seen!!!!!!!!,"Eddie Murphy is funny in this movie but, his lackey Julius Jones (Kadeem Hardison) is even more hilarious. I didn't really take this movie all that serious but, it was fun to watch."
3,Missing fasteners,"Ordered the scooter for my grandson. When he opened it and we were putting it together, we found the fasteners that hold the wheels to the axels were not included in the box. It proved a big dissapointment since it was a holiday and no hardware stores were open to purchase the proper fasteners."
3,Not great for transportation,"I bought the Fuzion as a replacement for an old hand-me-down Razor that my eight year old used regularly. I've been a little disappointed by a few things. The wheels are wide and the material creates a lot of friction with the asphalt which slows down the scooter so you have to constantly kick. However, the four wheel style prevents the rider from kicking and building up speed. Your heel nicks the wheel repeatedly.I imagined my son being able to pick up speed and carve down the street but speed is hard to achieve on a flat surface. The carving (independently jointed wheels and handle) works well and the scooter definitely looks cool. I suppose the Fuzion would be better in a skate park setting if you enjoy doing tricks but my son really needed something to get from place to place.The two, roller-blade style wheels, with the brake on the Razor was better for our purposes."
4,"Great fun, but decor came off right away!","This fusion is great fun! My son loves it, but hasn't figured out how to ""carve"" with it. I think that takes practice. As for the sandpaper-like decor/ stickers that you put your feet on to stand, I was very disappointed in the way they came off RIGHT AWAY. Big white spots appeared where the paper or whatever came off."
4,Awesome!,Ordered this for my boyfriend's son for his 7th birthday and he loves it! He flies around on this thing to the point that is almost too fast. But he always wears his helmet and protective gear so it is all good.
5,Fantastic!,"I recently discovered Maria Mena and she has quickly become one of my favorites. To me, her style is a mix of Kate Voegele musically & Pink lyrically. Her lyrics are spunky and not just the typical sappy love songs, and the style to each song is different throughout the CD. My favorites on the CD are #4 (Blame it on Me) and #7 (What's Another Day). It's mostly upbeat with a few slow thoughtful ones (Especially #11, Sorry). Enjoy the CD!"
5,captivating,"heard ""you're the only one"" on the radio today and was immediately interested in hearing more of this singer. she has a very unique vocal talent. i look forward to hearing more from her in the future."
5,A glorious and witty picture book covering Morath's career.,"For Max Morath fans, it's a must: a glorious, glossy picture book with photos covering his entire career, accompanied by a text sprinkled with his humorous and perceptive observations about music and society. It's the type of material that has defined his performances, that has endeared him to us, and it continues to delight. The ""road"" of the title has a double meaning, embracing both the course of his career in ragtime and the course of a traveling performer's life. Each road occupies equal space in the book, with Morath's travels through America sparking additional observations about such topics as air travel, interstate highways, restaurants, chocolate malteds, among others. With his usual wit and charm, Morath finds meaning in the mundane. Photographs by his wife, Diane Fay Skomars, document these journeys, adding definition to the already vivid commentaries."
3,Pencil Grips okay...,"I bought these for my left-handed, 6yo son who was having trouble holding a pencil. They've been great for him. However, I thought the price plus shipping was way too much! Also, the soft, cushiony material they are made from attracts lint and dirt like crazy! I am constantly washing them off so my son can use them.So--yes, they're a help, but the dirt/lint attraction is a nuisance."
5,Makes me Happy,I loved being able to see the places I have read about in novels and poems . The book is well informed and the pictures are great.
4,It's About Time,"I've been hoping for a while that Three 6 would release a video collection, and it def. contains most of my favorite videos from them. However, they neglected to put some videos on here....Such as ""Tongue Ring"", ""Side 2 Side"", ""Hit a Mothaf***a"", & a couple others. I also felt that videos from other HCP artists should have been on here....Such as Lil Wyte's ""I Sho Will"" and Frayser Boy's ""I Got That Drank"". But whatever, this is still pretty tight. Pick it up if ur a 3-6 fan"
4,A good read,"This was a fast paced book. A solid storyline with strong characters. I did figure out who was behind the killings, but I couldn't figure out why. The ending was a surprise. I highly recommend this book."
4,Fun read,"A very enjoyable book from cover to cover. It is a book with an effective amount of satire and humor. Equal Rites is full of joy and insight, fun for both children and adults."
4,Strong start - slower ending,"Similar in pace to the first Discworld Novel, THE COLOR OF MAGIC, this book starts off strong, but slows down over the second half.This is the fourth Discworld Novel I've read (there are currently THIRTY Discworld Novels!), and I've found the later books to be funnier and of higher consistent quality - but, these first books are still interesting, and this one made me laugh a few times.One of the things that make the Discworld books so enjoyable, is the characters are so likeable; and the two main characters in EQUAL RITES are definately quite likeable - Esk, the accidental Wizard child prodigy, and Granny the Witch.I'm definately hooked on Pratchett's works, and I'm now slowly making my way thru the whole Discworld Series of books."
2,Thank GOD that's over...,"What do you get when you mix a almost non-existent plot with boring characters and mind-numbing dialog? You get ""Equal Rites"" - the third Discworld novel. I thought ""Colour of Magic"" was decent and absolutely LOVED ""Light Fantastic,"" so I was very much looking forward to diving in to ""Equal Rites"". Unfortunately, the book includes none of the characters from the first two books - instead focusing on a ""coming-of-age"" tale of an 8-year-old female wizard. I've read a bunch of humor/fantasy novels, and this one is right at the bottom of the barrel. Skip it."
4,"Humorous Poke At Sexual Politics, Academia & Wizardry","As its title implies, Pratchett takes a good humored and often critical look at sexual politics in his third Discworld novel, while at the same time wryly turning his pen to probe the often static and tradition-bound world of academics through a parody of wizardry and sorcerous notions in general. While not as tightly plotted as many of his later works, this is a far more satisfying and humorous work than some of his more recent novels, such as ""Jingo"" or ""Hogfather."" Full of one liners and skewed and often insightful views of fantasy as well as, by reflection, contemporary social institutions, this is a delightful read that should leave you laughing for more."
2,One of the weakest in the series.,"For some reason, it has a lot of interesting concepts, and characters I enjoy (the first mention of Granny Weatherwax), but to be honest, this is one of my least favorite Discworld books.Some of the elements never get used again, which, for the ones I liked, I found disappointing. And it does explain Borrowing for the first time as well, but other than that, most of it (besides Granny and UU) don't get brought up after this book. And while it tackles the ideas of sexism on both sides rather well, it doesn't seem to have the kick other books do.To spoil the rest of the series: Esk, for all her hard work, NEVER gets mentioned AGAIN. In any of the books. So if you skip this book, to be honest, you won't miss out on anything. I would have preferred it much better if anything in this book had made a difference in some of the others. At least after The Light Fantastic, Twoflower shows up again later..."
1,Aqua Sucks!,what the hell are you people talking about? aqua sucks! they have been out since like '96 give me a break~ AQUA BLOWS!
5,rocksteady!!,"The Slackers have done it again. this album is consistant with the premium quality of ""redlight"" and ""the question"" and the now classic ""better late than never."" I'll tell you one thing friend, the slackers are great showmen besides holding the title of best ska band on the block-- I've seen them play in Knoxville and Atlanta and both were two of the best shows I've ever seen because they have fun doing what they do. If you are ever priviledged to see them live, don't be surprised to see them take requests and witness Jeremy and Dave come out into the crowd. The new material is exciting because it shows that these guys can only get better. shh!- I also heard their photographer Denny is the best young photographer in NYC. rocksteady!!"
4,in a party mood...,"With the exception of maybe the live record, this comes off as probably the most fun-loving record these guys have put out to date. The band sounds relaxed and confident as they stretch out and explore a whole bunch of different sounds and styles. I've only had the record for about 4 hours now, so perhaps its still early for judgement. Certainly it jumps out of the box and is probably more immediate and party-oriented than its predecessor (the more somber, but infinitely-wonderful ""The Question"", which is probably my favorite record - ska or otherwise - of the last five years). The ""Wasted Days"" songs will sound great live...and lets face it, this band seems incapable of being less than brilliant, so hurry up and go get this record already!!!"
3,okay for the price.,"Verlaine's poetry is new to me so I can't rate the tramslation. In the kindle format, no navigable TOC and the poems are formatted as paragraphs, so start here only if u have never encountered Verlaine before and want to get an idea of his content."
2,Not a novel,"This book was a mildly entertaining novel until shortly into the book the tone changed. Suddenly, I knew I was no longer reading a novel. For the most part, the chapters labeled 'history' are dry with an occasional interesting tidbit. The later 'novel' chapters don't offer much."
2,Our Lady of the Lost and Found,"I was excited about the premise of having Mother Mary appear in someone's home and seek refuse for a week. What a wonderful idea.I began the book with enthusiasm, and for a few chapters enjoyed reading it. However, often things were presented in a shopping list style. It was not simply ""this had occurred"", but ""this had happened, and this had happened, and this had happened"". After a while I felt like I was listening to a teenager talk about her life, not a grown women.The most alluring parts of the book for me, were the telling of how Mother Mary had an infulence in the world and the miracles that had come about in her name. The rest was like someone just introducing these events and letting us know how excited she was to have her in her home. She wasn't able bring across how someone might feel having had such a miracle occur in her life."
3,Life-Size,"I recorded this movie for my daughter many years ago when it first came out. She is now 18. She was so excited when she saw it and begged me to buy it, and yes, she still loves it."
4,What a Doll!!,"And what a fun movie.Star of The Parent Trap,Lindsay Lohan,stars as a motherless child,who is given a fashion doll for her birthday.Magically,the doll comes to life,and befriends the lonely little girl.There isn't a great storyline but it is a great movie all the same."
1,This movie makes me puke,"Don't listen to all these people!I watched this movie because it had Lindsay Lohan, and I am a die-hard fan of Lindsay. She is so hot. But anyways...This movie made me want to puke. The conclusions were unclear, the themes were conflicting, and the whole premise was really really stupid. Even in the end, the true problem of the little girl (not having her mother) had not been solved. Tyra Banks was an annoying skank who says such things as ""I'm anatomically correct"" to a man and then slaps him for propositioning her. The whole movie is fake feel-good-touchy-feely disney crap. I am a teen and I hate this movies guts. Don't believe peope who say that ""teens will love it to."" If you show this to your teen they will kill you and hate you forever. THerapy will not be able to solve the problems this movie creates."
4,very good,this was a very good movie too watch. which made me laugh from beginning to end. like hot movies see this one.
4,hot movie,lindsay lohan stars in the hottest movie yet life size. which has alot of funny scenes that are worth watching.
3,One hit wonder,"I can't believe this CD is up for $99? That's absurd!!I found it for $5 off ebay, I believe. I had heard one of the tracks on a nascar racing game--""I Am"" which is a fantastic song. Very fun and upbeat. ""Black Shine"" (including the remix) isn't bad, either, darker of course, but great grungy guitars and melody, but doesn't match the quality of ""I Am""All the remaining songs sound plain weird (and even very similar to each other;guitar riffs especially). They don't flow at all, with huge contrasts of guitar rocking out one second, then suddenly a gentle electronic melody takes over, matched horribly, akin to putting peanut butter with fried chicken--it doesn't work. Overall, it sounds like there was little effort put into the remaining songs just so they would have a full-featured CD."
2,"Great content, very poor condition","The condition listed as ""good"" should actually be ""will fall apart into 2789141 separate pieces if you try to open it to read it"" It is frustrating not being able to bring it with me anywhere for fear of losing chunks of the book (when I first took it out of the packaging it fell into three pieces, and has been splitting into more pieces every time I read it, despite being extremely careful). It's a same because the book itself is a very thorough and overall great read."
1,The bomb,In the Book The Bomb by Thedore Taylor. He uses a lot of real events from World War II. The whole idea about the Atom Bomb and them using it on an inhabited island is a type of thought I would have never thought of. It is aboult a boy who has to take charge against the Americans from dropping the bomb on there island for a test.I felt that I could relate to the main character Sorry. Because I once had to take charge agianst my friends. I wanted to stand out and show them that I wasn't afraid to do what needed to be done. In the book it was the same situation.That makes me feel that a lot of people get in this type of situation and it ends up in all the same situation.Taylor uses a lot of facts in this book and to me that's what makes this book so great. Everyone should buy a copy and read it.
2,The book was alright but needed some work.,"This book was good but could use some work especially twords the end, where it was scetchy. otherwise read it it's verry informative."
1,One of the worst books I've ever read,"This book did have a lot of facts from World War II. But it was so boring, and so drawn out, that i had serious trouble reading it. I had to read this book for summer reading, but if I hadn't needed to read this book, i would put it down 20 pages into it."
5,I must disagree with the book description....,"While the book description said The Laws of Destiny was bound to capture the interest and consciousness of all adults, it failed to mention it carries the same effect with just about any reader, regardless of age. I would love to see this book put in my high school curriculum, for Madame Hills is right up there with Woolf, Dostoyevsky, and Joyce. She captures human nature beautifully and the novel carries an incredible depth in its deceptive simplicity. Can one man change his fate? Are our destinies meant to be altered? And what are the reprecussions that follow if we do decide to manifest our own destiny? Put down Harry Potter and read The Laws of Destiny, I'll even buy you the book."
5,POP SONGS,"VAYA QUE LA DIVERSIDAD MUSICAL ES TAN EXTENSA...UN EJEMPLO SON LAS BALADAS DE A.S., ESTE ALBUM ES CONSIDERADO DENTRO DE MI PERCEPCION PERSONAL COMO MUY BUENO, CANCIONES QUE NO FUERON COMERCIALES EN SU MOMENTO COMO ""KEEPING THE LOVE ALIVE"" (CON ESTA ROLA ARRULLABA A LA BODOS CUANDO NO CUMPLIA SU 1ER AÑO DE VIDA Y RESULTABA MAGICA, ESTO APROX. CASI 20 AÑOS DE SER EDITADO ¡¡) O ""DUN'T TURN ME AWAY"". AGRADECIDO CON LA NOSTALIGA QUE PROVOCAN SUS LIRICAS Y ARMONIAS. MORK. ZAPOPAN, JAL. MEXICO"
4,Hill Folks........................,Received in good condition. I live in the Ozarks so can relate to the information. Answered questions I have had most of my life. A little hard to read in places but I enjoyed it.
3,Cute doll but the shoes keep falling off...,"My daughter wanted Crazy Karaoke for Christmas and was very excited when she opened her gift and got her wish. I thought the doll was cute - my daughter loves to sing and she really enjoyed singing along with Jade. The only problem I have is that the shoes/sandals will absolutely not stay on the dolls feet. She moves her hips back and forth ""dancing"" and sometimes topples forward if she's not on a steady surface. Other than that, the doll is cute. It did not hold my daughter's amazement for as long as I thought it would, however. Even so, I'm glad I got it for her - even if there were rumors on the news that someone had bought one that said curse words! I listened very intently afterward and did not find anything wrong with mine..."
3,Perfect Mosley,"As always, Mosley delivers here a racially charged, highly engrossing detective story. He does plot and mood better than just about any mystery writer at work today."
3,Haynes Repair Manual,"Book does cover most topics, however not enough pictures with each topic, and not you may not find the appropriate chasis for what you need to do on some of the repairs. Shows mostly older chasis."
2,Another American Product Demise,"I was disappointed with the SW240 and it sewed like it was ""factory refurbished"" instead of new. While trying it out, it sounded like the parts were loose and clanged to the rotation of the needle. I wanted to keep the machine and then found out that there are not any authorized dealers in my area to check it out and see what the problem could have been.The 2 stars are for the look and what seemingly is being offered. I have used Simplicity machines for years and I'm sorry to see another American product lose its quality:-("
5,A musical jewel,"One of the most amazing 'fusion"" albums ever cut was this wonderful musical jewel from Dixie Dregs titled ""Dregs of the Earth"". Versatile, the music flows from rock, to jazz, to classical with high progressive undertones.The level of musicianship is way off the charts under the leadership of guitarrist Steve Morse, whose guitar sound is incredible. Listen carefully to the 'dialogues"" between Morse and fellow member Allen Sloan in violin and you will be surprised by the notes flowing from this gentlemen, add Rod Morgenstein vigorous drumming and you cannot be dissapointed specially in his masterful use of the china cimbal and floor toms. The quality of this album is superb, the sound mix was perfect. Few instrumental songs have touched my senses so deeply as ""Hereafter"", it's like listening to heaven. I will gladly recommend this outstanding musical work to anybody who enjoy the endeavour of listening to unique and provocative music that break the genre barriers."
2,Not impressed,"I bought this because I wanted to apply heat to a stuck nut in a tight spot under the hood of my car. I was able to fill it up easily from a butane canister. However, it is very hard to light, in part because you have to twist a knob and press it at the same time. You can't light it with one hand. Even indoors it takes multiple tries to get a flame going; outdoors in the cold (40 degrees F) forget it - wouldn't light at all. When I lit it indoors, and then tried to carry it outdoors the least bit of wind would blow it out. I would not buy this tool again."
5,Not a Floyd Fan,"I was never a Pink Floyd fan and still don't really find their music all that inspiring or noteworthy. That said, the recording quality of this album is amazing, I have around 20-30 SACDs and this is easily the best sounding."
5,"Remastered, even better than the original","I loved the original when it came out, can't remember if I have it on vinyl, 8-track or cassette (but can't play any of those conveniently any more). I bought the CD primarily to load it into iTunes so I can listen on my iPod, and also listen in the car."
3,BennY Goodman Volume 3,"This is an excellent introduction to the Benny Goodman Orchestra. The recording quality is very good, and several tracks feature vocals from Peggy Lee -- sounding especially terrific on ""Not Mine."" The changes in line-up during the war years are not to the detriment of the band's overall sound, and Benny Goodman's playing on these tracks is some of his best."
1,Unsuccessfull,"I got this filter from a retail store. It is absolutely terrible, when i compare this Sunpak with other smaller diameter filters i have (Hoya and Hama), Sunpak is absolutely unable to produce enough polarizing effect.Also, the filter changes its color balance while rotating. I really wonder if they feel a little bit of shame while distributing their product. Absolute return."
1,"For $30, I thought I knew what I was getting","I bought this today as an alternative to more expensive polarizers. I figured, yeah, it's not going to perform as well, but it should be good enough. I was wrong.The problems start before you even put this on your lens. That is, if you can get it on your lens. The threading sucks, and even at its tightest, mine never screws on flush with the lens barrel and always feels loose.The threading on the outside is short, too. I prefer to put my polarizers under my UV filters to protect them, but this one won't hold it. Similarly, I can't even put my Canon lens cap over the polarizer if it's on the outside because the threading is too short to hold the clamps.Now on to performance. What performance? Done.I feel dirty for even letting myself buy such a cheap filter."
2,not recommend,At first I think it's a good deal when I got it from BestBuy. It turns out to be a disaster!!I took this cpl in my trip to wild poppy flower field in Antelope and it destroyed the color in the red poppies (the colors are faded out and not balanced when I turn the ring). Last weekend I used it for Horseshoe bend and my friend face is totally distorted when I put him near to the corner. I won't use this cpl anymore.Not recommend to anybody.
2,Poor Quality,"The first table was not symetrically set on the base, screws were stripped and top had a crack. They sent me a second table that was gouged and looked worse than the first. This company deals with poor quality goods and then would only give me a 10% discount on the damaged 2nd table. Do not purchase this table or anything from this dealer."
5,great set,this is a great dinette set for a retro kitchen. It goes wonderfully with the old coke tins and red accents. It's exactly what I wanted.
2,"Cannot update maps, no saving points","The nice things about this unit are obvious:* the form factor* great screen* video supportThe bad points make me want to send it back:* The maps aren't very complete and they CANNOT be updated. Harmon Kardon's support is nonexistent and they certainly are far from providing map updates. In several cities in Northern California I've looked for restaurants and cafes and found almost nothing, when just driving down main street tells me there's tons.* Very, very difficult to set a 'Go Back' navigation point."
5,Harman Kardon GPS-500,"Exceeded my expectations! Very easy to use. Recalibrates within seconds if you ignore directions, you can't go wrong if you try (and I did!). ""Saved places"" feature is extremely handy. Music and video very impressive. Great to have SD card function. Very pleased."
4,A nice introduction to Celtic designs,I like this book. I have worked two of the letters in the celtic alphabet and they turned out nicely. The designs are fun and whimsical and not too complex.There are some small errors in the charts however so look them over carefully before you begin.
5,This book helped me through school.,I don't recall ever writing a review but this book deserves one. I am keeping this book through school and may even use it later in work. It is just too handy to get rid of. My kids may get some good out of it as well.
5,DDR!,"For those who've never heard of DDR, this is hands down, the most interactive game of all time! It's basically a dancing game, where you have to literally do the moves to the beats of the songs, and the harder the song, the more you have to dance. =) It has techno, j-pop, dance, hip hop, the basic music required for a good rave. :) A must have for anyone who likes to dance =)"
3,Good for what it is.,"It's an impromptu performance and recording. Given the limited amount of Mick Taylor live, it is for a true fan. Yes, I've heard better, but it is what it is."
2,essentials of neural science and behavior,this book was in pretty good shape. However there were many hi lighted markings thruout the book that made it difficult to read. It was a bit overpriced. the book came in a timely fashion.
3,Disappointed,"I was really excited to read this book after reading The Godfather, but I was disappointed when I read it. The book reminded me of fanfiction and poor fanfiction at that. I was really disappointed."
3,"3 Stars for trying, but its over lets all face it.","Many people today agree that the Godfather was the best movie and book ever done. It is truly a work of art. I own the DVD and still when it is on Ch 9, I cant turn it off. The person which created this new verison wanted to ride on the coat tails of somthing great. You cant blame him and should not beat him up for that. He wanted to give us what we all truly want. The answer to what happend to the Corlone's! I do agree with many of the comments below. Mr. Puzzo has passed on... and the way he left us wondering... is the way it should stay. Even Mr. Copola the great man himself knows he should have left it at Part 1 & 2. Only Mr. Puzzo knows the outcome and he has left it all up to us to come up with our own ending. That is why I do give this new author some credit. Thanks for trying Mr. Author..Create somthing new..A new family, a new movie....You can do it! Keep it clean like the Godfather and it will SELL!!!"
3,Good...not Great (but close),"If you are a fan of the films (and the original novel - but especially the films) you may like this book. Done in the style of the films with jumps through time, etc. the book fills in storyline holes - some good (how did Clemenza die?) some that are not important (how/when Fredo met Johnny Ola). In addition there are some new characters which brings a freshness, but all in all it is just a little bit too long. I found myself reading long scenes that really could have been shortened or left out all together. I wonder if the author thought this was his ""only"" chance to be a part of this and wanted to get everything in. I am looking forward to reading ""Revenge"" so I can see if the author tells a more taught story."
1,horrible... don'T waste your time!,"i am struggling to finish this book (and am only doing so because it is a pet peeve of mine not to finish a book i started).the descriptions are tedious and lapse into long winded stories to explain a significant event which usually is just mentionned in one line in future chapters after it occurs. it's like he is trying to cram in as much backstory as possible but does not actually want to develop on current happenings in the plot.none of the characters are particularly likeable. In the original, you were rooting for Michael, and even though he is a cold blooded killer, Puzo made him likeable. The character developments are superficial and oh so cliché!i really wish they had just left the story as it was....big disappointment!"
1,No not good,The writing is very juvenile. It is at times incoherent and lacks any sort of story line. it has promise which is not kept
2,Lots of Mistakes...,"I haven't finished the book yet, but within the first 100 pages I have noticed a whole slew of mistakes: like, did the author never actually see the movies or know basic TV and medicinal history? Here are the four top ones I've noticed:1. One of the characters in 1955 mentions watching the Untouchables on TV: that show premiered in 1959.2. The author mentions viagra - in 1955.3. Michael tells a story about his father, and says that Vito's mother was murdered, stabbed to death: hello? She was shotgunned in G2.4. The author states that during the Michael/baptismal killing spree Kay and the kids were at her parents' home in New Hampshire: the killings happened the day she was at the baptism with Michael, and within a day or two she was trying to console Connie on Long Island about Carlo's supposed death. One fast trip in dem old cars!I can't wait to see what the author blows in the rest of the book. Sheesh."
1,"Fredo is the lucky one, he didn't have to read this book!","The worst. A huge p.u. I wish I had my money back, but I'd give twice that just to have my ""time"" back! Charactors went no where! Could have been a great book with just a chapter or two about Clemenza, Frank Pantengli, how Fredo unknowingly set up Michael.... anything! All we got was countless boring pages about nieces, cousins, wives and crap! The book gives you absolutely no additional information about the Corleones. I could now sit through insurance seminars for days and days with a big smile on my face. When people say, ""how can you stand it?"" I'd reply, ""'cause I spent four days reading the Godfather Returns!"""
1,Winegardner sleeps with the fishes,"This is how ridiculous this book is -- Fredo is gay. Yep. No joke. That is the big hook. There is absolutely no suggestion of such a preposterous twist in any of the films (not even in the ""king of makes no sense"" - Godfather III). But, Windegardner, perhaps simply to shame the franchise - or perhaps just because he is catering to morons that looovvvee reality t.v. -- decides to add in the preposterous.Needless to say -- I would recommend watching Godfather III before reading this book. At least with Godfather III, we can at least blame, in part, a studio that refused to pay Duvall. Weinegardner has no excuses."
2,No writing at all,"This book tries very hard to come up with ""stories"" to fill the gap of those years we had previously read and saw in the movies...but it becomes more a event list than a fiction.Disappointed."
4,Godfather Returns Satisfies,The book The Godfather Returns answers some of the questions readers might have had after Mario Puzo's original Godfather novel. It also is pretty true to Puzo's writing style.
4,It Works!,"I just finished Winegardner's Godfather Returns and found it to be fine. I was a little hesitant after reading some of these reviews but didn't find any of the items mentioned in these reviews to be too problematic.I'm a Godfather junky and was looking for more. This book delivered. Winegardner does a great job of fleshing out the characters and really made me understand the characters in much clearer terms. (I liked it enough that I'm going to get his Godfather's Revenge.)It's not Puzo, and unfortunately it will never be. But I found it a good read and would encourage anyone who is on the fence to read it. As long as your not overly sensitive to what I consider mild interpretation differences you will enjoy this book."
1,Focus 21 order,"It took over two weeks for me to recieve it, and when I did the package was damaged and product had leaked out! I was very unhappy!"
1,very bad,it smells awful! it's not strong at all and it doesn't resist humidity! the hairdo will last only for 2 hours and that's it
3,Decent no-frills slide viewer.,"The Pana-Vue #2 is a decent no-frills slide viewer that offers the ability to view slides but does not offer a lot of functionality. The specs at the time of my purchase indicated Product Features of: * 2X magnification on 1 7/8"" screen with folding stand. My unit did not come with a stand. The illumination provided by 2 AA batteries isn't really enough to provide the viewer with a good clear image but is sufficient for those who need to pre-view a number of slides prior to scanning them into a digital archive. You can evidently buy an A/C adapter/transformer for this unit but at nearly $20 shipped, I question the value of that investment. There are other models out there that likely deliver more bells and whistles. For basic needs, this viewer does an acceptable job. It is made of plastic and will likely break easily if dropped onto a hard surface. It's cheaply made and some what cheaply priced."
1,Too Small,"I purchased this for my mother to sort through old slides. It was so small, she couldn't use it."
4,Does the job purchased for.,"I bought this viewer to go through 5,000 slides left to me by a late relative. It performed as expected, and I'll now use it to go through my own slides. Suggest buying the power cord if you have a lot of slides."
3,Slide viewer,Product has already failed to work. Worked okay when I received it but after viewing only part of my slides it has failed to light up. Replaced batteries and tried several ones to be sure that was not the problem. Not happy with such limited service! When it doesn't last longer than that it doesn't qualify as inexpensive.
4,slide viewing,"I wish I had gone with a 3x or 4x unit, but it did exactly what I needed it to do for my family photo project."
2,Series 7 vs Series 1 through 6,"All Creatures Great and Small Complete Series 7 is much less than the first six series of the BBC program. It lacks the originality, humor and apparent spontenaity of the earlier programs."
4,Rondine vocal score,Exactly what I expected...EXCEPT...one on the most famous and beautiful arias( Parigi) sung by Ruggero in act 1 is actually missing!!!
4,my daughter loves this!,She dances and sings and will keep your future Beyonce' occupied at least until she goes thru all the songs a few times. The only thing my daughter gets a little annoyed with is that her microphone isn't cordless so she has to stand close by the little karaoke machine. Other than that its a cute toy.
2,Palm Beach from a Narrow Perspective,"This is not a very accurate portrayal of Palm Beach as a whole. Kessler focuses primarily on the lives of five people and then throws in some other stories to give the book some length. The content of the book is very scattered. Many times I was left wondering where this guy was going. I personally know that some of Kessler's information is factual, which was a delight to see in print, but some of it I strongly questioned (as have many Palm Beachers). He could have uncovered some great stories if only he had done a little more research. It was worth a few laughs anyway."
2,Interesting read but not earthshattering,"I initially picked up this book because I thought that life in Palm Beach would make for an interesting story. I was wrong. Dead wrong. Instead I find tales of deceit and lies interwoven to form a web of snobbery, elitism, and low self-esteem. Yes, low self-esteem. For if one really reads betwen the lines and asses the information in Kessler's book, one will find that the people are lacking inmany ways that money cannot fix. Overll the book was interesting. However, I feel that Kessler indeed got bogged down with too much namedropping and with too many vague and uninteresting characters. The story could have flowed a bit better and perhaps would have been more interesting had he gone more indepth about the bigotry that currently inhabits Palm Beach. Still, this was not Kessler's best work."
4,Enjoying my workout!,Today is my first day of working out since having a baby. My son is 4 months old and I enjoyed working out with him. I really like that it's easy to follow and it's something I can see myself doing for a long time. Can't wait to see the results. I highly recommend this DVD.
1,There ought to be a law . . . or at least a Fatal Mallet!,"This merciless attack is filled with unsubstantiated pronouncements (not to mention typos) about Chaplin including a diagnosis of manic-depressive personality disorder offered nearly twenty years after his death and with no research nor expertise to support it. And is Joyce Milton herself qualified to make this judgment? Of course not. While this discourse is passed off as well-researched, one look at the notes and citations shows a limited selection of sources with a clear intention--to topple Chaplin whom Milton simply does not like. It seems as if the thesis of this book was in place well before the ""research"" began. Such is the tone of personal invective Milton fobs off as insight. I would never claim that Charlie Chaplin was a saint; no one can reasonably make that assertion about anyone. Unfortunately, Joyce Milton shows how imperfect a writer can be. Sadly for her, she picks up where Kitty Kelly leaves off. Shameful."
2,In the tradition of Kenneth Anger...,"Probably no biography is without some value, but this is one of the two worst Chaplin books published. The comedian was hardly a perfect man, and there are things about him even a long-time fan might find bothersome, but much of this biography is trashy and filled with unsubstantiated ugly rumors. David Robinson's CHAPLIN: HIS LIFE AND ART, published twenty years ago, remains the best way to learn about Mr. Chaplin's complex life and work, while Glenn Mitchell's CHAPLIN ENCYCLOPEDIA I have found very helpful. This book is best ignored and forgotten."
5,love the inversion table,I purchased the inversion table for my husband's birthday. Assembly wasn't too hard and he loves it. My kids are using it too. The foot grips are very comfortable too. Some of the other inversions have had complaints on the ankle/foot grips- but this one is great!! Very user friendly.
3,Bali bras,"The bras are okay. But not what I wanted. I will buy Bali bras again, but not this style. Like my bras to have a little padding."
1,Not good,"Not comfortable at all. Cheap material. Bad looking.Don't buy, even it's cheap, but still not worth.Don't waste money."
5,Love this bra,I am a 36DDD. This bra fits flawlessly. Good support - I look 10 years younger. Very comfortable. Does not look like a support bra.
1,camera case,"the quaility of the stiches is so bad, the whole bag is crooked, sewing is the terrible one l have had ever seen products from China, the importer didn't even check the basic minimum quaility of a third class bag needed to has , the quality of the bad is a no no no worst than fifth class with the Pentaxc name on it"
1,FANTASTIC???,"Ever notice that the syntax for all the positive reviews of this book is the same? Notice that every favorable review says ""fantastic""? Maybe Arlene wrote each and every review with the word ""fantastic"" in it. Ya think?"
1,Geneva Black Watch,"Not very good quality, I was dissapointed with the watch, for the platinum band is already starting to peal off."
2,Classic?,"I've always heard this book was a classic, but I just couldn't take the 3rd grade dialogue."
5,In Search of Humanity and Truth,"This is not your typical book and it doesn't have your typical content. It is tough going from the start. The first section is told by an idiot who can't comprehend time!! The second section is told by a neurotic on the day of his suicide. The third by a Southern bigot. The fourth by the standard secondary narrative. This novel searches into humanity's soul. It questions truth, time, race, history, and many other themes. But don't believe me. Go out and read the book yourself!"
3,Not sure I get it,"I really didn't get it. I sort of enjoyed the book and I do believe that Faulkner is undoubtedly a talented writer as he has a very descriptive and artistic way with words at times, also I suppose there are lots of good things about the book in what you may learn about human nature or life in the old south and whatnot, but I was never engrossed in the story. I basically forced myself to read it hoping it would get better. And it did, at least it made more sense in the final chapters, however the ending was abrupt and I felt like I was left hanging with unresolved issues. I'm afraid I can't put myself through another reading just to figure it all out."
5,"Celebrate Faulkner Centennial with ""The Sound and the Fury""","Although this year marks the 100th anniversary of William Faulkner's birth, his work remains fresh and startling. The Sound and the Fury, unquestionably the hardest Faulkner to read, is worth the extra effort. Dealing with family relations, the decay of the Southern aristocracy, and above all the triumph of man over his situation, the Sound and the Fury sweeps the reader through the Faulkner landscape into the vortex of human emotion and language. A must read"
1,Bracing Myself For the Flak I Will Catch,"Okay, I know, I know. All you Faulker fans out there are going to pounce on me, call me an uneducated whosie-whatsit who can't appreciate the genius of Faulker, etc, etc. Here's the thing: the story isn't what I dislike, it's Faulker's writing style that kills me. Every time I read Faulkner I enjoy the story but hate the process of chipping through the layers of Faulkerese to get to it. Honestly, the only reason I'm even rating this is so that Amazon will stop putting him in 'My Recommendations'.To those of you who enjoy him, I salute you. I'm much more of a Joyce fan (so please, berate me for disliking Faulkner all you like, but don't tell me I can't appreciate classic literature)."
2,Another Dissenter,"Any book you have to consult Clif Notes for is poorly written and inaccessible. Or maybe the reader is somewhat on the slow side. Still, the guy who invented Clif Notes should be publicly flogged and those caught using should have to retype this book on an old Underwood No.11 with a bad ribbon. Then let's see what you think of it."
1,I did not like this book at all.,I found this book very difficult to read. I did not enjoy it. I don't think I will tell anyone to read it.
2,What would Mark Twain say?,"A classic is something that everybody wants to have read and nobody wants to read.Mark Twain (1835 - 1910), Speech in New York, Nov. 20, 1900"
1,"A Tale Told by an Idiot, Signifying Nothing","The book forces the reader to plod through a dreary stream of conciousness technique. This was the first book I ever read that was by Faulkner, and as a result the last. Faulkner must have written some good books given his reputation, but this book struck me as a pretentious attempt to show that he too could write in that then new fad of literary snobbery, stream of conciousness."
2,The Sound and the Fury,"Most over rated writer of all time. I have tried several of his books and do not like any of them. Try Fitzgerald or Hemingway if you want authors in his timeframe. If you want short stories, try Alice Munro or William Trevor. For my money, they are two of the all time BEST....."
3,Good Luck,"This is quite the novel, to be sure, and yet despite its venerable reputation in reality it is a puzzle inside a conundrum to read. The writing style varies from section to section and its lack of chronological order makes it difficult to decipher. The story of the slow degradation of the Compson family is dramatic and very interesting, but unfortunately, without the cliffs notes handy, the finer points of the novel may pass you by."
2,BORING AND CONFUSING,"I enjoy reading just about anything, so I figured I would give Faulkner a try. Somehow, I had managed to escape reading this one all the way through college and in book clubs with my friends. Other reviewers have basically laid out the plot and characters, but to me the chapters with the Benjy section, then Quentin, then Jason, followed by Caddy (whom I enjoyed) were boring and never-ending. Caddy ""searches for the truth and reality of any situation."" I must confess that I didn't understand a lot of the symbolism in the novel, nor I did care to or worry about the whole thing. So I went to Cliffs Notes for some help (don't tell the college literature professors), to speed up the painful process. Maybe in another 30-40 years, I'll try another Faulkner novel. Jason's ""success in life is due to the fact that he feels no love for anyone..."" which was similar to how I felt about this book. No love, fellow readers."
5,Intellectual challenage,"So many books and so many authors are classified as being greats and classics. But many of them are confined morally and technically. Faulkner, however, writes what he chooses and writes it how he chooses. He shows the world through the mind of an idiot, a suicide victim, and a sadist. His stream-of-consciousness seems to be a much more natural manner of writing. This novel is one of the best I have ever read. It is gripping and emotionally charged. A must read for anyone who desires an intellectual challenage."
3,"Good, but rides really high.",Kind of dorky because it sits so high on your head. It is built for safety though. It looks good.
4,"A real tearjerker, but worth it.","A double amputee is reluctant to accept the love of a beautiful fashion model (also the sister of a good friend). The characters are more well developed than usual for a book this short. I suspect this book is the third in a series about this family/group of friends, but I have not been able to find the other two yet."
4,Victory in Europe: D-Day to V-E Day-Max Hastings,Another good book by Max Hastings. I liked it enough to buy the rest of his books simply because of the information he puts into each one.
4,Front heavy phone,The red is a real retro red. Nice and heavy. Already getting lots of comments on it. The ring is great and not annoying like todays phones. The only issue I have is the earpiece sits a bit lopsided on the crade. Whats up with that?
2,poor sound quality,"I received this phone,it is cute and retro hoping to replace my WWTTON red retro phone but the sound quality in the Crosley is poor.There is a background buzz and when speaking on the phone the volume is too loud and this volume,unlike the ring volume, is not adjustable"
2,Looks Good But Mine Has Been Troublesome.,"I purchased one of these Crosley phones about 2 years ago. I used the phone as a backup and thus its use was occasional. The phone worked properly for several months until the day that I had trouble answering a call. The handset mechanism appeared to be stuck and as much as I flicked the button and jiggled the phone, I could not get the phone to connect properly. This turned out to be an intermittent problem for several months. However, eventually this problem developed into a permament issue to the point where I now plan on replacing the phone. I have lost far too many calls to risk having the phone around even as a backup. It is really too bad because the phone appears to be well made. I should also point out that while the phone is attractive and looks vintage from a distance, the body material is not Bakelite but a more modern material. Still, I wish my phone worked properly because genuine vintage phones are quite expensive."
4,Great Looking Phone!,"I am happy with this purchase. What a cute retro phone! I am a bit diappointed in the background noise (slight static, slight buzzing) when talking on this phone. The noise is not loud enough to ruin a conversation."
3,Damaged cords cannot be replaced,"I got my phone only two weeks ago -- and really loved it. I came home last night and discovered that my cat had turned the cord into a toy and chewed through it, exposing the wires and essentially ruining it. What's completely frustrating, is there is no way to replace the cord, so the phone is now trash.Other posters had mentioned this flaw, but I never imagined my cat would chew on the cord.I won't be replacing the phone. I'm sorely disappointed that I can't replace the cord. My brand new phone is now good only for the trash."
4,All I Have To Do Is Dream.,"I Bought this used on vinyl record. Ive been collecting records here recently and thought The Everly Brothers would be a nice add to my collection. I have not listened to them alot over the years but once I started digging around on them I relized how many songs that I knew by them. My favs on this Double Lp are Bye Bye Love, Wake Up Little Susie, Bird Dog, All I Have To Do Is Dream, Til I Kissed You, Love Hurts, The Price Of Love, and I Wonder If I Care As Much. There are a total of 24 songs on here and the playing time is around 57 mins, give or take. It came in a gatefold jacket which has pictures and information covering some of there career on the inside. The record itself is on black vinyl with black picture info labels and blank inner sleeves. When you spin this it will surely take you back in time."
3,KD sunglasses,I thought I was getting original KD sunglasses. there is no KD logo on the frame. However I do like the spring loaded ear pieces
5,Great service from Jura Capresso,"I have owned this machine for 1 year and use it every day. Quality and convenience is superior. I encountered a problem this month - steam could not be created for the frothed drinks. I contacted Capresso, they sent a pre-paid UPS sticker and, reluctantly I sent my machine in for repair. Using our old drip machine was horrid! Coffee tasted terrible and I did sneak over to the local Starbucks on a few days.Fortunately, I only had to endure 4 days of bad coffee. Got it to the local UPS store at 4:30 pm on a Wednesday and it was back to me on Monday morning. Wow, I could not believe that the UPS man was actually delivering the machine when he did. They replaced the steam unit and, preventative, the brewing unit.Overall, fabulous macine with fabulous coffee. Excellent service from the company when a repair was needed."
2,"good coffee, problem machine","My machine makes great coffee. Unfortunately it spends a lot of time being repaired. We have had two water leaks at a repair cost of 300.00 each. in the last 2 years. It had to go in one other time (under warranty). Its easy to use but the filters are 22.00 the tablets are 18 dollars a package and the thing breaks down for no apparent reason. I spoke to the phone service people this morning and while they are very helpful and kind on the phone, even they admit my machine has required too much time in the shop. I'm not sure if its just this machine or if they are all unreliable and require constant expensive repairs."
1,Nightmare to maintan,"These peices of crap make decent coffee for a year or so and then break down. You can't get into them to fix it yourself and they won't even look at it unless you pay $300 a pop. Customer Service are for the most part A$$holes' ""I wouldn't have spent $3,000 for a coffee maker in the first place""??!!!???Stay away..."
2,Reliability Issues,"Great when it works. Unfortunately, that's not all the time. My first one had an internal leak right out of the box. My second one got past that, but often jams when retracting its grounds ejector and does not flow the coffee well."
1,Sad,"This book made me sad because there is a death in the book. I also hated the way Marvin's ""friends"" treated him. They didn't act like real friends should. The book describes a very mean substitute teacher... I don't like that. The only thing good about the book was Marvin's nice teacher."
5,What's not to like,"We've had this faucet for several weeks. It operates very well. The hose pulls out smootly, it swivels easily, and the two different sprays are a nice feature. Since Price-Pfister guarantees their faucets pforever, how could you go wrong? If you're in So California, their main office is also really nearby in case you did have a problem. It is lightweight, but I think of that as a positive, since the last Hansa mega-expensive faucet weighed a ton and never worked right. (They eventually went out of business in the U.S.) I'm done with high-end ""foreign"" stuff that is supposed to be better."
2,Egotistical,"Not really helpful to the aspiring autobiographer, as Zinsser's approach to teaching the genre seems to be to present his own memoirs and explain how wonderful they are."
5,Best CD ever - Timmy-56 Rules - timmy56.virtualave.net,"This is truely the best CD ever created. Yes people will say its pop, considering Semi-Charmed Life was number one on Z100's (a popular new york radio station) top 100 of 1997. I saw someone gave ratings for each song, i'll do the same.Losing A whole Year - 4/5; Narcolepsy - 5/5; Semi-Charmed Life - 4/5; Jumper - 5/5; Graduate - 5/5; How's It Going To Be - 5/5; Thanks A Lot - 5/5; Burning Man - 5/5; Good For You - 4/5; London - 5/5; I Want You - 5/5; The Background - 5/5; Motorcycle Driveby - 5/5; God of Wine - 5/5"
1,Third Eye Blind plays weak rock,Third Eye Blind is just an ugly child of alternative rock. A horrible and flambount sound coupled with the lead singers absence of voice make this an album to avoid at all costs. The words rock'n'roll have taken a hard hit with the creation of Third Eye Blind.
5,This CD is the best!,"I'm pretty picky when it comes to cds.But I got this cd and instantly fell in love with it.This is the only cd I have that I listen to the whole way through. I don't really like Jumper all that much and I feel It gets too much air time. But the rest of the alblum is very good. #9 ( Good for you) is also one of my favorites. They have songs for all your moods. (examples) depressed? Listen to Jumper. Bad relationship? Listen to How's it gonna be ,or Good for you. Like someone ? Listen to #13 - Motorcycle drive by and Semi-charmed life. If you don't love this cd something is wrong with you!"
5,This is the greatest CD ever!!!,"When I went and bought this CD, I didn't know what to expect. But it is the best CD I have evr heard. All of the songs are so good and they have a really good beat to them. I recommend this CD to everyone! It's da bomb!!!"
5,what can i say that hasn't already been said?,i agree with a lot of the people here about this album - it definitely cannot be compared with artists that came out at the same time... this cd is amazingly written and beautiful executed.all i have to say that hasn't already been said (because many of you have done justice with your reviews) is if you're going to buy it for one song and one song only it has to be motor-cycle driveby.... and the rest of the cd is just as good to boot!
4,Let's Get One Thing Straight!,"People, you must be on crack if you don't like ""The Backround"". It is THE most beautiful song ever recorded. Not the best, but most beautiful. Every song is good EXCEPT for ""Semi-Charmed Life"" ""How's It Going To Be"", ""Burning Man""<---what kind of title is that...and the lyrics ""cause i live my life/like a burning man""...what in God's name is a burning man?..., and finally ""London"". The rest can stay on there. Most of you are too obsessed with the radio played ones...GET OVER IT.I have to admit, 3eb is one of the best albums i have heard in a while, but Smashing Pumpkins still rock. ""I Want You"" is beautiful. ""Jumper"" is awesome. ""Good For You"" kicks. Those are the songs that matter. Not that other crap. Get off of it!If you like ballads, you'll like #'s 4,7,9,11,12,13,and 14. But i suggets you get Nirvana's ""nevermind"" instead. And all the SP albums. Then maybe you'll be able to appreciate these guys a little more.-Jeremy M."
2,"Phew...for a minute there, I lost myself.","You see, the major difference between this band and lets say...Radiohead is that Third Eye Blind are currently doing things that other people have been doing for years, and radiohead, well no one really understands what they are doing because no one has ever done it before...ever!Its just something that i find quite interesting."
4,"third,eye,blind rules","This is an awesome cd by third,eye,blind.They did an excellent job.I rate it 4 out of 5 stars.I like 3 out of the 5 songs i listened to.3 out of 5 is a good amount songs.So keep it up third eye.You rule"
1,"No. Just, No.","Relies on the basic late 90's alternative rock/pop formula, nothing new, nothing exciting. If you're a yuppie who buys what everyone else does, and listens to what everyone else does, which you probably are, then this is for you!If you have any respect for quality music, run away."
4,"not ground-breaking, but still fun","This CD is a lot of fun to listen to. Third Eye Blind for the most part is making music that is just fun. They aren't great writers or musicians, but if you just want to put on a CD for a party, or while cleaning your house, or just chilling, this one is good. I disagree with some who said all the songs sound the same. ""Graduate"" ""London"" and ""Semi-Charmed Life"" are fun meaningless rockers while ""Background"" ""Motorcycle Drive-by"" and ""God of Wine"" are thoughtful, edgy ballads of a sort. There's a good range here, so don't expect the rest of the album to sound like what's been played on the radio. P.S. In concert they were pretty bad. They didn't sound nearly as good (probably because their album was well-mixed and produced) and they didn't seem to enjoy themselves."
5,THE BEST CD EVER RECORDED!!!!!!,I'd have to say that this is easily the best CD of the decade!! The songs are great and Stephan is an excellent singer/songwriter!!
5,Wonderful CD,"Great songs. Great feelings. Lots of hours of fun listening. How's it gonna be, Jumper, and Semi-Charmed Life make the CD worth every bit of the normal price. Order this CD now!!!"
2,same difference,"Matchbox Twenty, Sister Hazel, Third Eye Blind, Semisonic, etc. etc. ad nauseam.What's the difference between these bands? Nothing! Same corporate pop marketed by shysters as ""alternative"" pushed down the throats of the masses year after year after year."
3,"Alright, but not the best","This album is certainly not as good as the band's sophomore album, 'Blue', but no Third Eye Blind collection is complete without their first work. Be sure to check out 'Blue', which is arguably the best alternative rock album ever!"
5,This cd rocks,If you have a cd player you must get this cd. it's worth buying for upto $18.00 at least. every song is origanal and you shouldn't loose your intrest.
3,Simple Fun for the Ladies,"For some reason, despite the book's tired and sexist premise that men are dogs who tend to switch partners once they get tired of the ""Old Cow,"" and its general schlockiness, I still managed to enjoy it on a very simple level. It's very much a fluffy romantic comedy set amidst the same old New York upper middle class that always seem to be the backdrop for books such as this. Unlikely to provoke any minds, it should appeal to fans of Bridget Jones' Diary. One of those books that must have caught me at just the right moment, 'cause I bet if I reread it, I'd toss it."
3,A sharp start that dribbles away...,"I've already recommended this to several friends, although I have to admit that it's not as good as it should have been. The gimmick is put to terrific use - spurned girlfriend obsesses hilariously, creating a science out of male-pattern-dumping. But so many things here don't add up. First, why the utter hysteria over a failed relationship that was a mere few months old? Why the surprise over a failed relationship with a guy who was cheating on his fiancee? What the heck is wrong with Jane? And, alas, the novel just falls to pieces in the final chapters as if the author didn't quite know how to wrap up the high drama. All this said, though, there sure are a lot of funny observations about relationships, realistic or not. I stampeded right through it in a couple of days, entertained (if not always impressed) all the way. Moo!"
1,disappointing,"from the phrase ""old cow-new cow"" the reader can infer all that will be said on the subject by the author. these are not exactly new concepts. i kept waiting for some enlightened, original twist to come along. and waiting. and waiting. just read the back cover of the book and you've pretty much got the jist of it. perhaps this could have been excused if the plot were interesting or the dialogue snappy or the characters likable. i wasn't expecting to be astounded by a profound and enlightening modern classic and i realize this probably wasn't the author's aim. but i was expecting to be entertained in a brigid jones's diary kind of way. this book did not even accomplish that."
1,One trick pony,"If you've been unlucky in love (and who hasn't), you'll probably find a book like Animal Husbandry a good cure for the blues. A book LIKE Animal Husbandry, but NOT Animal Husbandry itself. This book was a one trick pony. The author states her initial premise early on, but then never develops it or the characters. I kept waiting for her to flesh out her old cow/new cow theory, but instead she kept repeating the same joke page after page, chapter after chapter. I wanted to laugh, but the book just wasn't funny. I wanted to cry, but I just didn't care about the characters. The strength of this book was supposed to be its witty commentary and snappy dialogue, but I found the whole thing trite and predictable. So obviously based on the author's real life that it was painful to read."
2,like a song bird not a soprano,"I have to say Gruberova has a nice light voice but nothing to back it up. She is nice to listen to but the music is totally dead, it lacks emotion and soul. The mad scenes are about the core emotions the composer wrote into the coloratura phases. Gruberova just can't get to that place. If someone was looking for a soprano that can look to Maria Callas her mad scene album is truly supurb. Beverly Sills and Joan Sutherland have nice recordings of these arias also."
5,Peyton Manning Jersey,The jersey is perfect. It looks great and is made of excellent material. Professional looks without having to pay professional prices. I would not hesitate to buy from this seller again.
5,Great Bargain!,"These Propet sandals are comfortable, lightweight, and as my Mama used to day ""the price is right."" You cannot go wrong with the comfy shoes. I purchased a 9 narrow, and they are true to size. I usually need to wear orthotics, but my feet feel wonderful in these sandals."
1,Not comfortable at all!!!,"I could not even walk across the room with these on! Even though I ordered a wide (D), they pinched the back of my feet and I could feel where the blisters would be . . .Returning them immediately!"
4,Awesome deal!,"I ordered these for $15 a couple of weeks ago since I own a pair of propet sandals I purchased last year. This brand is SOOOOO comfortable, I just couldn't resist the price since they had it in stock for my size for the low price. When I received them.. they are alot more narrow in the foot bed than my first pair, and I wear a wide. They look wider in the picture.. not that they are tight, just that they hug the foot so they aren't a ""big"" shoe like my first pair. They also are VERY strappy (the straps are thinner than they appear in the photo) .. I mention this because I am sure they will leave interesting marks on my feet after a summer in the sun.. if this bothers you take this into consideration. My first pair have a sunburst pattern that has left a mark on the top of my foot that is still there a year later. If you get them for a major discount, it is definitely worth it for the comfort, but I would not have paid full price, or even 50% off for this style."
3,"Great scenery, but....","This three disc DVD set has the best scenery on two of the three discs; the disc with the male instructor is actually done in front of a LITERAL green screen! You know, like in the movies? I'm thinking, are they serious? They actually thought someone doing poses for any amount of time in front of a green screen would be engaging? The other two however, are set on a lovely beach, with the sound of crashing waves in the background; the second is between some gorgeous mountains and greenery. Other than the green screen, I found these DVDs just plain bored me to death. Every single pose and transition was soooooo slow and deliberate, I thought I was going to fall asleep. Not only that, the poses were rather basic and not so challenging. I guess it depends on what you're looking for."
1,Do not buy this product!,"This is not a reliable product. I had to return the main battery (overheated and the auxillary battery (NC2B, dead on arrival)once each while they were under warranty. Now that the warranty has expired I have nothing but toxic electronic waste for disposal! The manufacturer will not/cannot repair the defective system. They will not stand behind their product.I notice that the big box retailers (Best Buy & Fry's) aren't carrying this system any more. DO NOT BUY!"
3,A real rarity,"I never thought I'd see this on a CD. ""Rising Sun"" was a minor hit single in Southern California, and the flip side, ""Strollin' Blues"" was just as great. Both were performed by the group on the TV show Hullabaloo. The liner notes are worth the price of the CD alone. Steve Stanley did a masterful job of documenting the group's history. The CD sound, however, is a disappontment. It is not stereo, as indicated on the label, but mono with some stereo ambiance added (the mono sound, however, is good). It is a mystery why they used a mono master, because a true stereo master was available: I know this because I have a studio copy of the master tape. The bonus tracks were mastered from vinyl 45s, by the sound of them; ""Strollin' Blues"" even sounds like it was from a single that was a bit off-center. Still, it's good to have these songs available again."
5,One of the only CIA-critical books written from the inside,"Ralph McGehee's Deadly Deceits is one of the most sobering books you will ever read if you are an American. Written very conservatively, the book slowly climaxes with a series of haunting revelations. It is ultimately a gripping and enlightening book. It was very influential to me when I was figuring out how our nation really operates. The CIA and United States are not the good guys. They never have been. McGehee's book is a strong antidote to the fairy tale nationalism that American children have been steeped in.What McGehee went through just to publish his book is worth its own book. The CIA went to great lengths to try to prevent the publication of his book, and he receives their harassment to this very day.Ralph is a great man who is doing his part to stop the killing of the innocents. I highly recommend his book."
5,Southern Rock At It's Best,"The debut l.p. by Tampa, Florida's Outlaws was by far their best effort. Dual lead guitarists Huey Thomasson and Billy Jones were the energy in this band. Just listen to ""Green Grass High Tides"" and you'll understand. The 1975 radio smash ""There Goes Another Love Song"" was typical of the Southern rock sound at that time. Also, guitarist/vocalist Henry Paul added that ""real"" country vocal style of singing to this great band. The band did go on to release some great l.p.'s, but in my opinion nothing compares to this debut release. Thomasson is now a member of the ""new"" Lynyrd Skynyrd and although The Outlaws are no longer around listening to this newly remastered cd will bring back memories of the good ol' seventies!"
