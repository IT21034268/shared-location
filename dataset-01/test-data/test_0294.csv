2,Nice guy without much of a story to tell,"I've enjoyed watching Richard Karn on ""Home Improvement"" over the years, but found this book to be a disappointment. There just isn't very much substance to this story about his home remodeling experience. The book has lots of white space, and some obvious things aren't there (like a floor plan or before and after photos) that would have really brought some life to the text. The narrative is somewhat choppy, with brief mentions of some aspects of the project but no real explanation. I've had several smaller-scale remodeling projects done in my home and found most of the ""tips"" listed pretty obvious. Also, while there were a few interesting bits about the show and Karn's earlier career, at least part of this material read like a collection of one-liners. I could almost hear the rim-shot as I read each punchline. Overall, not worthwhile."
4,Don't try this at home.,"The book is worth the admission price only if you heed the message: Pay attention and plan. It is funny, and it is nice to know anyone can be afflicted with the 'HomelyImprovement',virus. the good news:No one was murdered at the hands of the homeowners -the Karns;it is only money, and someone elses money at that; It is reality, and could happen to you."
5,Still going strong,I bought this one a few months ago to replace a smaller Swingline model. This one is still going strong. Seems to be fine for relatively light personal and small office use.
4,Not bad for light stapling work,"I've had this on my work desk now for a little over a year, and it has met my expectations. To be fair, I don't do a whole lot of stapling, but it has done the job when needed. I use the battery option since there is not an open outlet handy, and I've yet to have to replace them. I'm going to knock it down one star because sometimes as I try to feed the paper in, it gets stuck before it reaches the point to trigger the stapler - so it takes a little back-and-forth to get it stapled."
5,Excellent Add-on,"This was an extension for an voip system. It works well, pairing easily with the main phone. After all these years, I become more convinced that with cordless phones, Panasonic is the only way to go."
2,So Little Meat,"What I wanted was information about this medium, how the properties of this medium compare to traditional oils and to acrylics, how to use the medium developed for wso, etc. What I got was a little information, then paintings done by a number of artists, many trying out wso for this book with very little information about how they used wso. I went to a wso painting workshop taught by one of the artists in the book, hoping to learn more. Instead, she told us all the reasons she doesn't really like this medium. This book shows that there is a real need for a serious book on water soluble oils."
2,cheap quality,Like most cheap quartz clocks...it makes a loud clicking noise. The automatic time update is not compliant with the latest time change settings under the Bush plan.
4,expanding one's horizons,"This is a very impressive-looking edition of the Harry Potter books and I thought I'd really lucked out when I ordered this boxed set, but when I began reading them, I was disappinted to discover that all of the British expressions had been substituted with American ones. 'Cooker, post, and top-of-the-range', were replaced with 'stove, mail and top-of-the-line'. To me, one of the great purposes of reading is to expand one's horizons and broaden one's vocabulary-- to discover something new about people or cultures or oneself, but this Americanized version robs one of the opportunity to do that. The stories still follow the same inventive plot lines, of course, but the books just seem a little flat without the added element of exploring British culture just a little bit."
2,Harry Potter - boxed set of books 1 to 5,"I wanted the set of Harry Potter books in hard back. Amazon offered them at a great price.I have read them before, and since I received the boxed set, I am reading them again before I start reading the new # 6.As always Amazon service is the best!"
5,Fantastic,I can't tell you how great the service was !!!! I ordered the set of 5 books along with the newest book for my 17 year old son and was told delivery was to be in mid-September. To my amazement I received the books in less than a week !!! That is amazing because I did not request any special delivery and I currently live in Germany working for the U.S.Army and I have an APO address with a P.O.Box ! How can you beat that ! I have ordered other items through Amazon and service has always been excellent beyond compare. My son is always reading these books and is already on book #3. Thank you ! Thank you !
5,Only two more to go,"This is a pretty good collection of the series. With only two more installments to go, you get a jump on having the finished set. The only drawback is that their paperback, but the set is good anyway. This story has a lot of heart. The only book of late that is equally as good is The Wisdom of Shepherds-- an up and coming sensation, apparently."
2,Did not get it all,"I signed for a boxed set with anbook mark. That is not what I got. I got the five books wrapped in cellophane, not boxed and no book mark."
4,Harry Potter,I think they are good reading as long as you make it clear that these books are pure fantasy and are just reading books.
5,Lighten UP!,"To the Christian reviewer, and all who read the ""12 year-old's"" comments: These books are good reads, descriptive and easy to follow. As far as JKR being the devil, please keep in mind these books are fiction. I don't know about anyone else, but I was taught the difference between fiction and reality by my parents and teachers at a very young age. Just because I read these books does not make me want to go out and curse people or even believe that this type of magic exists. I suppose all works for fiction could be taken this way if you have that much time on your hands. I prefer to read, enjoy and move on. Personally, I know I've read required reading through school that is much worse than these as far as being influential to young minds. In closing, please lighten up and enjoy the read. :0)"
5,Excellent Read!!,I decided to try it and see what all the buzz was about. The books are excellent. I can't put them down!! I am finishing the last book now.
5,Hardback cant be beat...,"You just cant beat a set of hardback books...Especially this set, between this and the newest edition I have them all and they look mighty fine sitting on my bookshelf..."
1,The Harry Potter Books,"Something horrible happened and I never received this item. It was sent through DHL and they failed to drop it off on the porch. Therefore, they handed it over to the USPS. I can't even figure out how to contact the person that sold me the books?"
1,Bad Books,"Harry potter is awful. Kids books from REAL authors such as Huxley, Grahme or Dickins or something intellectually stimulating!! Harry Potter is a marketing force that's dumbing down America."
3,Erika Flynn LSMS,I didnt like any of the Harry Potter books because it has whitch craft in it and whitch craft goes against the bible.It also has some violence that could teach some young childeren to be violent and sometimes childeren then could become suicidal or even homicidal.
4,A nice and cheap collectors' box,"If you wish to own the little wizard's stories but don't want to spend a fortune then this set is the perfect choice. This box features years 1 to 5 in a big font paperback edition. That`s certainly one of the big values of this product for I as a reader don't want to ruin my sight with nasty small sized fonts. Besides, the box looks well in any bookshelf!!The only thing I didn't like about it was the paper for it's not the best quality but nothing is that perfect in life!!!"
4,Excellent beginner's book on Anglo-Saxon heathenry,"""Hammer of the Gods"" deals in detail, on a beginner's level, with Anglo-Saxon heathen beliefs and practices, and there has not been before or since a book that is as comprehensive on that particular aspect of heathenry. The book itself is very polished and professional, and the only disagreement I might make with its contents is that the author chooses to go with an interpretation that the Anglo-Saxons believed in 9 worlds rather than 7, despite plain literary evidence to the contrary, without really spelling out a cogent case for why he makes this assumption. (Although in fairness he does *acknowledge* the problem, so it's certainly not a deal-killer for me.) Definitely worth getting if you're interested in A-S heathenry."
5,Top-Notch,"As a heathen focusing on the Anglo-Saxon tradition, this book is the single most-often referenced book in my collection. It is not only an excellent starting point for those interested in Anglo-Saxon heathenry, it contains enough depth to be continuously useful to the practicing heathen.The author is a long-time Anglo-Saxon heathen and is perhaps the leading authority in his field. His writing is scholarly and yet very readable; it is clear that he knows his subject matter to the degree of depth that only comes from years of study and practice.Whether you're just starting to explore Anglo-Saxon heathenry or you've been at it for a while, this book is one to have."
3,"Big, Big",It is really a big clock. It really could fit in a class room. I am going to keep it because it change to standard time instead of daylight time. It is quiet too.
4,four and a half stars!,"Its a real shame that David Gemmell died so young and we won't be getting any more books from him. This is a retelling of the Troy story, and probably due to this it takes 50 pages or so to get rolling, but once it does you can't put it down. Its convenient that the whole series is published so when you finish part one you can just roll on to part 2 and 3!"
3,Not your average Troy,"I would not describe this book as a page turner, but it was still a good read. Before you pick up this book you should be aware that this is far from the story of Troy we are used to. If you are looking for something new in the retelling of this classic story, then this is the book for you. I have yet to read the second book in the series, so we will see if some other characters get introduced, but this book was missing many main characters. Menelaus is non existent, Helen has all of a paragraph, and Paris shows up maybe 2-3 times in the story. Hector also is absent almost the entire novel. I don't want to give specifics on how this story is different from other Troy retellings, but just know it strays from the classic story. I think the story will be more enjoyable if you know that upfront and just enjoy the story that is being told by lesser known characters."
2,Not worth it,"My daughter seemed to enjoy decorating the cats, but the activity didn't take long. It was rather simple. The heads come off very easily."
4,Beautiful Again,"The second in the series is just as beautifully written as the first, in fact, the author out does herself in her gorgeous descriptions of the world the story is set in. However, I didn't enjoy it quite as much as The Ill Made Mute as although the imagery was perfect, I thought the plot was much slower.This won't stop me from getting the new one the instant it is available!"
5,Wonderful,"From the moment I started this series I noticed that it was different, the writing style is so gorgeous that it entirely changed my own. The characters are so real and so wonderful that once I finished the book I could not wait for the next book. April sure is a long time away."
5,Very engaging read,"Well, I have to say that this is the best series that I have had the pleasure of stumbling across in quite a long time. I thought that the first book was slightly better than this, the second title in the series. However, this volume served to flesh out many details in part 1 (which I reread again after this one), and the last 100 or so pages are mesmerizing. This is a lyrical author with beautiful prose and sweeping canvases of locations and characters.I wish that the 3rd installation was available now.Enjoy!"
2,Poorly Constructed,"This product is very wobbly and doesn't work very well. After five minutes of use, washers come off, screws fall out and the legs start to come off. The digital monitor doesn't work either -- it didn't record steps or heart rate. I probably should have realized that a $200 fitness machine was too good to be true!"
2,Eh...look elsewhere,"While it looks compact and efficient and the price seems right, the design is mediocre to poor. It is difficult to fold up, and not easy to transport. The screws and washers continually fall out. The electronics eat batteries very quickly and don't work well at all.I would not purchase this again."
3,Good Read if you don't have anything better to savor,On the eve of the Revolutionary war she risks her life for the patriot cause while her passionate captain struggles with his code of honor in the face of his desire.
4,"I like it, I love it, I want some more of it!","I bought this little xm radio with the intention of using it for my morning walking routine. With the amount of stations to pick from, there is something for everyone. I personally love the station BPM (beats per minute) on channel 91. It makes for a great workout. Since this radio works much like a cell phone, you may have some issues. I discovered that the antenna is a pain in the butt when it came to using the radio like a walkman. It was hard to keep the antenna in an area where the wires would not get in the way. You could feel very trapped! However, if you purchase the head phone set with the antenna already built in, it makes all the difference. This is a great product, but you really need to purchase the other head set which is available on xmradio.com if you would like to be completely mobile with ease."
4,He Loves It!,"I bought my husband a Delphi Roady 2 last year for Christmas and had XM started and ready to go on Christmas morning. He has used it every single day since then. So, this Christmas, I decided to upgrade him to the Tao XM2Go.He was blown away with this unit and by the end of Christmas day, had already transferred the service via telephone, and hooked it up in his car.So far, he hasn't had any problems with it, except one. When using this as a ""walkman"" type device, the signal does fade in and out, but this is solvable by using the 5 hour recording feature, so he's very happy!The only complaint that he's had is that it doesn't appear that you scroll through songs anymore...just channels. Since he used this particular feature a LOT, he was kinda bummed that the TAO doesn't have it (thus the 4 stars), but overall, he's very happy with the unit."
4,It's For Beginners!,"I have used this now for about six months. I had no airbrush experience when I purchased it and have used it for basic jobs, such as painting the hull on my model ship. It took me awhile to adjust it properly but then it did the job I was asking it to do. I only use water based paints so it is easy to clean and maintain. Don't expect to do hairline stripes or other fine detail work, this isn't the tool for that. I have had no problems with this, as long as it is clean, and it is the ideal airbrush to learn with."
3,The broken promise land,This book was a little drawn out and boring at times. I wouldn't recommend it.The author has bee known to do much better.
2,expensive,"This book is nice and covers the main topics of sampling but I would suggest to review other books on sampling because 160 is a significant amount of money. Personallly, I would suggest to consider Cochran, Kish or Sarndal because I consider them stronger in some areas."
1,My Family Wouldn't Eat Them,"I purchased a 12-pack of Kashi GOLEAN Peanut Butter & Chocolate bars for myself and my family. We tried one and nobody wanted to finish it. It tasted way too much like a ""power"" bar. I didn't expect a candy bar, but there are some healthy bars that taste good. The bars sat in our kitchen for a few weeks before we threw the rest (11) away. What a nasty tasting waste of money! I contacted Kashi about returning the bars, but they just sent me a few coupons for some free bars. We tried some other flavors, but they weren't much better. I would rather have had my money back."
1,"B&W, Bad Writing and Faulty Info....","The book is in B&W; with few photos, poorly written, outdated breed information with general stereotypes concerning the breed. The book spends little time on The Berner's personality and what to expect about his character and temperament on a daily basis.Try:Bernese Mountain Dog: An Owner's Guide to a Happy Healthy Pet by Julia Crawford.The Bernese Mountain Dog: A Dog of Destiny (Hardcover)by Bernd GuenterThe Beautiful Bernese Mountain Dogs: A Complete American Handbook by Russ & Rogers"
2,"""The Cherry Bomb"" as we used to say.",Correct me if I'm wrong (and please do) but didn't Tovarich Chekov himself say this play was a comedy bordering on farce? Can someone please recommend where to find such a version !!?WD
4,Enjoyment and reflection in one book.,"I not only enjoyed this book, I found it very thought provoking.The time frame it was written about, and the problems people then faced. It clearly kept my attention, as I finished it quickly."
3,Meteorite Impact,"Low on visual effects, but has a lot of information and speculation. Great value for the money."
4,So bad it's good!,"Yet another pick from classic 1970s blaxploitation. It's definitely not Dolemite, but it had enough action to keep me occupied for all 96 minutes. This one's hard to find in regular video stores. Amazon is about the only place I know that even carries this film. A great addition!"
5,Piper at his rowdiest,"This tape came out in the mid-80's, right around the time wrestling (or at least the WWF) really got big. This tape features Roddy Piper in several wrestling bouts. Piper is seen teaming with Doctor D David Schultz against Jimmy Superfly Snuka and Andre the Giant. This is a great match for Andre fans as well. Piper is also seen teaming with frequent partner Cowboy Bob Orton against Jimmy Snuka and the Tonga Kid.Perhaps one of the real highlights is Piper declaring himself as the person most capable of interviewing himself. What follows is a split screen of Piper interviewing Piper. It is classic Roddy Piper.This tape is vintage Roddy Piper. It is when Roddy was at his rowdiest. It is before the (first) retirement match against Adrian Adonis, when Piper became a fan-favorite.This is a must have for any Piper fan. It also serves as a great tape for any wrestling fan who wants to see some great 'old school' wrestling bits."
5,Nice Replacement Blade,My lawn mower came with a mulching blade and a rear bag. The mulching blade is designed to chop the grass into small pieces but not to effectively push the grass into the bag. This blade does a better job at lifting material from my lawn and pushing it into the bag than a mulching blade. It effectively lifts things like small twigs and leaves off of my lawn. Installation on my Craftsman mower was easy.
5,Listening fun with Spanky and the Gang,"I always had a great time playing the 8-track version of this album in my car back in the late sixties/early seventies. Every song reminds me of the fun times I had. Great music from Spanky and the Gang with their distinctive sound. The title song and Sunday morning, especially, are wonderful."
5,"Elegant meals, simple to prepare!","I'm not even a vegetarian, and I love these recipes! You know that edge of anxiety about trying a new recipe on guests? All 50 or so that I've tried in this book have been perfect for company, and I don't hesitate to try a new one, regardless of who is at table. Delicious, nourishing, eye-pleasing, and nearly everything can be made from ingredients I always have on hand. I love this cookbook!"
5,My food Bible,"I love this book! speedy delivery, perfect condition, packaged very well. I recommend this book to anyone who wants to know about food and how it heals the body."
5,a real bargain for the price,"Loved this series when it was in syndication. I like it more then Xena or Hercules and 3 seasons was just enough before the series ran out of steam. This price is a bargain and since I see they are not making any more of these sets I was glad I preordered it. If you can find this set anywhere buy it,,, IT is a great show!!"
4,Mah Jong Set in Burgandy Hard Case,I am very pleased with the Mah Jongg set I recently purchased---The only disappointing thing about this set is that were no pushers included with the racks. I had friends over and as I was setting up for them I realized the pushers were missing - had to call my friend and ask her to bring hers----I would probably have looked at other sets if this had been made clear to me---I now have to order four pushers.
2,Mediocre,"We got this as a gift for my brother's birthday. We're somewhat disappointed in it, to the point where I'm thinking of returning it, and buying a different mahjong set instead. The set seems kind of cheap, the pieces seem kind of cheap. If I just wanted a random second or third mahjong set as backup, maybe this would suffice. But as a gift to someone, definitely not worth it."
4,Absolutely fascinating human-gender kaleidoscoping!,"As a performer and illusionist of both genders, I use this film to educate friends about the ancient art of illusion and regendering. A truly aesthetic delight for the entertainment of all.Terranea International Expressionist/Illusionist Paris/Athens"
4,A good introduction to Islamic Law,"This book is a good, balanced and concise introduction to Islamic Law, intended as a ready-reference textbook. It delineates schools of Islamic Law, history of canonisation of Hadith and the Sharia, and countries where reform of Islamic Law has been carried out.The author is a practicing lawyer in Nigeria who was inspired to write this textbook, because none existed. His position is Maliki (the Sunni school dominant in North Africa) although he acknowledges that the Hanifi school (dominant in Asia) is the most liberal.He focuses on Civil law, because traditional criminal law has been abandoned in most Islamic countries, in tune with the times.He covers various aspects of Civil law like inheritance, properties, Waqf, rights of women, etc."
3,okay,"This movie would make you wonder about drug salesman. I actually have worked in a Medical Office and could understand about how drug reps go into different doctors office to teach them about their drug they are marketing and why the doctor should use that drug. Otherwise, I would have not gotten some parts of this movie."
3,NOT A LIGHT SUBJECT....,THIS MOVIE IS A LITTLE DARK. I PREFER COMEDIES. LOVE KATHERINE HEIGL. A VEHICLE TO MAKE US AWARE OF DRUG COMPANIES' CALLOUSNESS AND GREED....
2,The first time I've regretted an Instant Video purchse :(,"The writing and acting in this will make you CRINGE. It's so cliche I literally had to stop several times and walk away to avoid giving up on this movie entirely. That is, until I finally did, about 3/4 of the way through. What in the world was KH doing in this god awful movie? Such a disappointment -- wish I could get a refund."
3,Thoughful but timid,"Dr. Drew's book is both thoughtful and thought-provoking. To his credit, he raises important questions and then discusses a variety of viewpoints. However, he seems to lack the courage to come down stongly on any particular position."
5,the best documentary about latin hip hop i ever saw,"This is one of the best thought provoking documentary ever. i had a chance to see this movie several times and i just cant take my eyes off of it. This movie brings out the truth about latin hip hop. It tells how latins were in this movement we call hip hop from the beginning. This is a must see. Everyone should see this documentary because it brings to the attention of how important latin hip hop is. BUY THIS DVD!!!... YOU WON""T REGRET IT!!!..."
2,Not tempered,"These are good basic glasses. The problem is Bormioli Rocco claims they are tempered. They are not (or at least not properly). Tempered glass is much stronger than normal glass. These break easily (we ordered two sets, a medium and a maxi -- one had a glass broken out-of-the-box, and the other had one broken less than a week after we opened them). Tempered glass also breaks into small, safe pieces, and shatters as a whole. These break into large pieces (I can't tell if they're any less dull, but one of my housemates claims they are), and they do not shatter as a whole (the entire base was left on the one we broke)."
2,Unreliable,"This thing sounds wonderful ... when it works.Problem is it only works for short time, then totally loses it's mind and freezes up my system. I can rarely listen to more than 6 songs in a row without total meltdown.It is much better at ripping MP3's, but about 1 out of 25 songs need to be redone as the encoding causes MP3 players to skip huge sections of the song.Save your money, buy something else."
1,Disappointing,When I first installed this board my computer wouldn't boot. I rearranged it and my other PCI boards and got the computer to boot but it took 10x longer than normal. After I loaded the software no matter what sound effect I selected it sounded the same. The board had two audio connectors for plugging in the output of the CD drives but then I heard nothing. Neither the audio plug-ins nor jumpers on the board were explained in the manual. I gave up and returned the board. Now my computer boots normally again. I have Windows XP pro.
5,I've Got Sound!,"Ordering on a Saturday and having it show up MONDAY is an outstanding service...It took a few minutes and some IT help to get the BIOS working, but mechanically, it went in pretty easy and my computer now can talk again."
5,Best Choice,"Salt is fine ground to adhere best to products, especially popcorn. It will ensure a tasty bowl of popcorn without leaving a lot of salt in the bottom of the bowl. Good choice!"
4,Good Old Fashioned Western,Chuck Connors stars as Geronimo. Who leads the Apache off of the reservation into high adventure. I have seen this many times over the years and when I saw this being released to DVD I knew thatI had to get it. This DVD does not disappoint. Good video transfer. They don't make movies like this anymore.
1,One of the worst movie,"During almost all the scenes, the two women get caught. Same scene continues monotonously without any attraction and excitation again again and again..... This is the worst movie I've ever seen as ""film"" and also as ""film for adults"". If you only want to see Misty, you can buy. If you expect some excitation or story or entertainment, choose another."
5,Excellent!,I bought this item as a used item. It arrived as scheduled. It was very neat and I could not really tell the difference with a new one. Great business.
1,"Average presentation, Average techniques, MAC Snob!","As of August,06 the techniques here are at best average, andpresented in the same fashion. To worst part is that itis presented on a Mac, and of course the controls are differentand even some displays on the layers pallette are different.It galls me to no end the Mac snobs that make presentations to a predominantly PC world.As of 2005, Mac had a 5.8% market share in the U.S. and 2.2% worldwide(source siliconvalley.com)Like most PC users, I wish the Mac computers DIE soon, so therewill be uniformity of platforms.DIE Mac, DIE!"
4,Easy to follow,"The DVD is a bit fuzzy, but the instructions are clear, moves at a good pace, and the trainer is pleasant to listen to. There are twelve lessons, each containing 7 to 12 steps, so they are quick and have both pictures and text. This book got me aquainted with the possibilities of Photoshop and enabled me to start doing my own creative work."
5,fire on the mountain,Fabulous movie for anyone even remotely interested in the 10th mountain division or the outcome of WW2.
4,"Quartet Whiteboard, 24-Inch x 18-Inch, Aluminum Frame,",Did the job it was purchased for and I'm happy with it.It only took about 10m minutes to mount on wall and every thing needed to do so was threre.
2,Book can be misleading.,"Unfortunately the author of the book has gone through pains to detail the Arab crimes against the Jews in the conflict, but he has left out the crimes of the Jewish/Israeli people against the Arabs. It can still be used as a history book but it does not give you the whole picture. It has an Israeli bias. Yet this book cannot be categorized as history revisionism since most of what has been written is true yet one sided."
2,A cheap way to make movies.,This movie is a mixture of two different films and neither of them is any good. Klimovsky edited his 1970`s film El Hombre que Vino del Odio and merged it with a new film directed by Al Adamson which is filled with violence and nudity but not enough length to rate it as a feature film. So both directors try to seel us these separate stories as a brand new one but the lack of continuity makes evident this is not an original release. Mean Mother`s only attraction is the presence of Luciana Paluzzi who saves this boring picture in the few scenes she appears.
5,Great Movie!!,"Fantastic if you like DC comics - wish they had more background on flash and green lantern, but it was pretty great overall!"
4,Top 100 comedy spoofs,"Side splittingly funny in its deadly earnestness, it is Plan 9 from Outer Space meets Brother from Another Planet. Must have been one of Laurence Fishburne's earliest efforts. I laughed so hard I almost wet myself. Director Ed Hunt is Ed Wood reincarnated."
1,The minutes passed like hours...,I think I must have been watching a different film from the one reviewed by some of the other reviewers. This film was so slow I started drifting off and thinking about work! The story line was utterly predictable and the acting was generally of a very poor standard - the most wooden I've seen in years. The woman who played the mother was surely acting for the first time. Just awful! Don't waste your money.
1,waste of money,The instructions told me to run through a container of water to clean the system before first use. It stopped percolating leaving much of the water in the basket. I could smell burning rubber and figure something was not right. Also as of then I could not close the filter basket thing. Great. I'm going to give this back and get something else. I expected more from Braun.
3,"cheaply made, just a matter of time before carafe breaks","Seems to brew good coffee, though I don't drink coffee and this is the opinion of guests. Because we brew rarely this machine is perfect, but the carafe is so thin that it's when, not if, the carafe will break. The little plastic piece that helps to hold the lid on the carafe broke on first use. My understanding is that the carafe is more expensive to replace than buying the new complete set. Not recommended for frequent use."
1,Coffee was lukewarm so I junked it,"Live and learn. I ordered this through Amazon and wound up tossing it in the garbage after a short while. My biggest problem with it is that it made coffee which was lukewarm. I happen to like my coffee HOT, and not lukewarm, and so into the trash it went."
5,The best coffeemaker I've ever owned!,"I have paid alot more for coffeemakers that have not been nearly as good as this one. For convenience, this one beats all with an easily removable basket for the coffee grounds that makes cleaning a breeze. The coffee is consistently good, and it brews quickly. I would buy this again in a heartbeat."
1,Braun coffee maker,I threw it in the garbage.Cheaply made and came cracked.I did not want to waste my time returning it.
2,Coffee not hot enough,"I purchased this coffee pot the first time back in 1998, and loved it. When it had to be replaced last month, I figured why tamper with a good thing, and got another one. The second one has been disappointing. Unlike the orignal coffee maker, the coffee in the new one doesn't stay hot on the burner after it's been brewed. As a result, you're left with a pretty mediocre cup of coffee and coffee pot."
5,"Braun KF400 is GREAT, but not dishwasher safe!","Best coffeemaker at ANY price!(I've tried some very expensive ones, and come back!)-Others were way TOO FAST & don't extract the flavor (it's still not that slow!).I've had mine for 18 years (pot a day), and still going strong (just bought a backup, for when...?).NOT DISHWASHER SAFE (had to epoxy my basket, years ago!)!TIPS, for a yummy cupa joe!-1. Natural brown CONE coffee filters (unbleached!NO HOLES in paper... (filters out some VERY BAD CHEMICALS...!!!).2. Whole beans (I prefer Columbian...) & use a !BURR! grinder ONLY (My Capresso has a very even grind. Not too fine!)!One batch at a time, & keep unused beans in freezer.3. I use distilled water!ENJOY"
5,"""IT'S A GOOD THING""","AFTER 12 YEARS I FINALLY MANAGED TO DROP THE BASKET AND RUIN MY BRAUN 10 CUP COFFEEMAKER. THE CARAFES ARE EASILY AND INEXSPENSIVELY REPLACED - THEY'VE BEEN AROUND FOR YEARS. NEVER HESITATED TO BUY THE EXACT SAME ONE AND ""LO AND BEHOLD"" THERE IT WAS ON AMAZON.COM! $19.90, TOO! YOU CAN'T BEAT IT - IT'S A WORK HORSE AND UNLESS YOU ARE OAFFY LIKE ME - IT WILL LAST AT LEAST TWO DECADES."
3,Ok coffee maker,"This coffee maker makes pretty good coffee (though it could be hotter), but the quality of construction is quite poor. The plastic lid that covers the water container is paper thin. The hinges on the carafe lid are very delicate.I used to have an old Braun that looks just like this one, but it was solidly built with brawny plastic all around. Too bad they've gone on the cheap."
5,GREAT FOR OUR HOUSE,"I have 4 children and always need a board to help them with homework. This was great price, good quality, big, cleans easily. The only bad thing is it not magnetic so you cannot hold anything but for the price is great."
3,Below expectations,"I always wonder why so meny people complain about the acting and cheap production of these films. Maybe they don't know what Seduction Cinema is about.Well, some of us know and realize that there's only one reason to buy their films. I have around 10 of their films and have never seen any in their entirety (with the exception of the excellent Erotic Vampire in Paris), just use the skip button to go the ""good stuff"".That said, this film was a dissapointment for me. Despite having one of the finest casts in a SC film, the lesbian action is nowhere near as hot as Vampire Vixens or Play-Mate Of The Apes. This film severely lacks action below the waist (even AJ Kahn wasn't her usual energetic self on this one) and I personally, don't like to see male hands touching our beloved Misty Mundae, here she has a sex scene with a guy.I recommend getting this DVD if you enjoy the usual Seduction Cinema humor but be warned of the limited sex content."
3,Lord of the G-Strings - The Femaleship of the String,"When i saw the cover and catchy title to this dvd, i had great expectations. Though the story doesn't exactly follow its counterpart, which i wont name, its leading character Dildo Saggins is tasked with an epic mission which could lead her to her doom, To destroy the g-string! Prohapse its dry, prohapse it lacked funding when it was made. Still, I would watch this movie with my girlfriend if I had one! ..."
2,"mildly funny, but not much erotic","This film is mildly enjoyable as a spoof of Lord of the Rings, but as an erotic film it's incredibly tame. I was surprised how little nudity is in it since it's played up as being such a sexy film. Since that's got to be the reason a lot of people watch it, why in the world did the producers not have some of the sexy babes who are in it romp around topless or totally in the buff through most of the film??? If you buy it to see such titillation, you'll find yourself mostly waiting for a few brief flashes every now and then. I think the overall low production values, such as the poor acting, also work against it being much erotic. So if you're getting this to watch in a mixed group or as a LOTR spoof it's OK, but forget about getting it for any kind of erotic turn-on."
1,A Waste of Your Money,These headphones are a total disappointment. The description says they are good for 100 meters range when in fact there is no reception aftet 15 meters.
1,Not a NATURAL product,"I should have asked my family to buy and or look at these products in the pet store, but they weren't home...since I am disabled and can't go out--I rely on amazon and reviews.I should have double checked first before springing for this obvious chemical spray. there's a LOT of warning labels on proper disposals and calling waste management. if this WERE a true natural product, why the warning labels?I am disappointed by this ""natural"" spray. I won't buy this stuff ever again.oh worst part is, the packages kept leaking like crazy, making it all the more difficult to use. if I want a more natural product, I am going to do some more thorough research next time out. I won't be killing my babies with chemicals."
4,Best book available on Brazil,"This book is worth reading, mostly because there simply aren't many books about Brazilian football, & you have to know about Brazil if you really want to know about football.Anyway, as a book about sociology of football, it is not bad. At least, there was quite a large amount of research and it showed. It just feels a bit awkward, because, despite the many years the author spent in Brazil, she wasn't born in a country which likes football. So, sometimes what she wrote sounds a bit funny."
2,Low quality,"I was disappointed in the quality of this item. From the first time I turned on the unit, I could smell something like the motor burning. The exterior housing looks very cheaply made. I would have expected a little more from a name like Cuisinart."
5,The Cairn Terrier,"This book is a must for all cairn enthusiasts, breeder and pet owner alike. Very comprehensive, covering all aspects of care and breeding. The quality of the hundreds of glossy, colored pictures is amazing. If you only have money to buy one cairn book, this is the one!"
3,ear candy for atmospheric metal fans,"No one can say that Lacuna Coil is original: The Gathering, Theatre of Tragedy, Within Temptation, and others have all trod the path Lacuna Coil now takes. Nevertheless, this is enjoyable music, though it has a tendency to become background music.The full-length album is slightly heavier than the EP, with more appearances of the growled vocals.Recommended, but not essential."
4,Very Enjoyable,"I have to say, even in their early albums, this band was quite enjoyable. They deserve a lot of credit on this album, they are trying their absolute hardest to try to be unstood in their songs. This was still during the day, when they were still trying to adapt to singing the English Language, i think the best effort was My Wings. Overall, any Lacuna Coil fan will love this, great effort, great songs. I can honestly say, that even if you understand them what they are saying or don't, you will enjoy this."
5,Great Story,This is a good story about reading. Perfect for my 16 month old granddaughter who likes books.
4,Make sure they actually drill the pilot holes.,The white board works but the directions kept mentioning pilot holes that were supposed to be drilled that weren't. Also the screws were the wrong size.Basically the whole mounting kit was a joke.Otherwise it works just fine.
5,GREAT!!!!,"I have no problems with season 3, at all! I think the DVD quality and picture is great! Of course, the episodes are super and a lot of fun!Some people are just never happy with anything and have to find something to complain about, even if it's not true.- Ian"
1,LATE ORDER BECAUSE IT WASNT PROCESSED IN A TIMELY MATTER,YEP THIS ORDER GOING TO BE LATE I SHOULD GET A DISCOUNT FOR IT NOT BEING PROCESSED FAST ENOUGH IN A TIMELY MATTER LIKE OTHER TIMES.
4,Welcome back to the roots of professional EMS,"Great!Waited for that for years! Forget the totally overpriced videosfor 200 bucks and more.But please: Show the boot to the country code and make them region code free !!!!I think you would sell a lot more of them in Europe, it's cult for anylongtime EMS participant !!!!!Saying more about Emergency would be a waste of time."
4,About time we get Season 3 Tooo Bad it's not up to par.,"I hope we do not have to wait this long for the next seasons sets but I also hope that the company reads the reviews and fixes their problems with this set. I agree with other customers, I have problems myself playing the disks on my machine I actually get bitmapping on some episodes and I also get the sound when Disk 3 is played, extremely frustrating. I do give them a thumbs up for finally doing single sided DVD's that was a great plus to this box set. Please Universal fix the glitches before putting out another season and keep the single sided DVD's. Otherwise this is a great set it has really good episodes and still is worth getting the set."
1,You get what you pay for,"I bought this because it was inexpensive and had FM-radio capability. My intent was to be able to tune in to the morning news programs at the gym (each television is tuned to a different station and one uses the posted FM frequency to follow the audio).I'm still trying to figure out how to make the thing work.After struggling to get it to talk to my PC, I finally managed to transfer some music files, but I'm still working on actually playing back the music I downloaded. And the FM capability has so far defeated me.I'm not a technology maven but I'm not exactly incompetent either. And I'm stubborn, so I'll get the thing to work because I refuse to give up.Oh, and the instruction sheet isn't the most enlightening, either."
4,great so far.,The only reason I give it 4 stars and not 5 is because I have not had time to get into it to beyond the first few chapters yet. What I have read and worked through has been great for me. I am learning to see and understand various things about Greek. I don't consider myself to be a brain and this book has met me at a level that is easily understandable. I would recommend this to anyone looking to get a basic foundation.
5,How People Grow Workbook,The workbook was in excellent condition. It was shipped in a timely manner.
2,Its the setting on the timers,People keep asking why the movie is called 7 Seconds. Its the setting of the plastique timers that were supposed to blow off the armored car doors at the beginning of the movie. GregG
4,PRETTY GOOD,"I liked pretty much I like the euro feel to the film. Action was really good and martial art were good and the plot no big deal either.Some plot twist that's good,but the film needed more romance just a little but the (PSP) version is really decent.I like to see Wesley Snipes on the big screen sometime soon."
2,NOT TO GOOD,"This movie was about as bad a movie as Snipes has ever made. Like the other review the beginning takes off nicely, but the flim begins to out think itself with lots of twists and turns. Im not sure what country it was shot in but there was not any dubbing of voices. I think Snipes just wanted a quick payday on this movie. renter only."
5,Worth reading,"Realistically describes the role of the non-starter in college athletics; worth reading for the roles of determination, family and faith in an individual's life. Good to share with high school athletes aspiring to play in college. Quick read, not the very best writing, but not awful either."
3,no change,"Bought this cause I heard that it can lower the operating temp of your cooling system by 10%. I noticed no differece in the temp range, but I also havent had any downsides to putting it in either. Id say its a wash."
4,Decent Film,"A little hard to follow, but I believed this could have been a real scenario anywhere but especially not in America."
1,Poor value for money!,This was $68.00.!!! - that was for 100 maybe?!!! Even the current price is way over. They are at hobby stores anyplace for $1.50 - or less! Hope no one orders at this price - yeah they are fun - but they don't last long - usually fuselage splits where wing inserts. Check Dollar stores too for similar 'planes!
2,"Yes, a cheep item, but I expected it to arrive unbroken.","Got here with broken wings. Had to glue it and doesn't work very well. I know this is an inexpensive item, but I expect when I buy something that it doesn't come broken."
1,Nothing wrong with the plane.,Plane was broken during the packing process before it was shipped. Its not worth the time/effort to complain/return. Was a little disappointed.These following words were added to get word count above the twenty or so words required in order to post this message.
3,O.K.,"There were just too many loop holes in this book, even though I did enjoy it! I wish Ms. Angell didn't just jump ahead so fast. The relationships were moving along and the BOOM, they were steamrolling along at an unrealistic pace. Especially Jackson and Celia. I enjoyed the basic story line and wouldn't have minded it being longer to let the relationships evolve naturally."
3,A $10 rice cooker dressed in stainless,"I bought this new and so paid even more. I liked the design with its insert that can be flipped over to serve as a steamer as I steam seafood and vegetables. It accomplishes this and it does cook rice adequately, though it does seem to get a bit messier than imagined. I liked the stainless look but would rate it as adequate. I do like the retractable cord but do not like that the low heat begins as soon as it is plugged in. After taking the rice out I have forgotten to unplug it and it can toast anything still in the pot inadvertently. Why no ""off"" setting?"
1,"Messy, overflows","I tried this cooker, and it was terrible. It is supposed to handle 8 (rice cooker measuring) cups of medium grain white, and if you cooked as little as 3 cups, it overflowed all over the counter. It cooked the rice ok, but was not worth the mess. I returned it.Beware"
4,Excellent,"I First heard this on Triple in Sydney, AustraliaThey are a fantastic band!i like every song on this album, buy it today!"
5,Greatness from difference,This is how to make a outstanding musical piece live! Respect the soul of it with a magnificent voice that is not polished-to-dead as too many interpretors have
3,"Wasn't a SEASON with the suns, just the POST-SEASON","It's a fun book, easy to read, has great information on players and yada yada yada, it's a book you should read if your a SUNS fan. Other wise I'm not to sure you'll be too interested.The title says ""My Season on the Bench..."" when in reality all he talks about is the play-offs. I was interested to see how Nash stepped it up during the season (not just post-season) against the other star PG's or Marion putting up great numbers against a strong Western Conference, how D'Antoni's comments about other teams, etc... but no...We read about 3 teams and the play-offs. Which is cool, but come'on. I think he really needs to change the title. And those little ""Time-outs"" that refer back to the regular season don't count, they are 2 pages and there's only about 10 of them, if that.I am not saying this is a bad book.Infact, it's a good book.I just bought M&M;'s and got Skittles, ya kno?"
5,Learn to Play Go,"I bought this book as a gift for my daughter. I am reading it also, in order to play the game with her. The diagrams and explanations are easy to follow and understand. She is looking forward to mastering everything in this volume and moving on to the next."
3,OK to start,"This is the first go book I bought. It does a good job of exposing the game and explains some techniques for capturing and connecting on a local level. However, it does not have any thing on a strategic level. I have since read another go book, which unfortunately is not in English or I would be raving about it, which does a much better job explaining the openings and the general strategy."
1,"Amazing, un-professionally written smut novel!","Even as a Republican whose stomach turns at the sight of Bill Clinton's face or the sound of his voice, I still found this collection of un-documented bachanalian anecdotes impossible to swallow.The text contains absolutely no citations. At the end of the book, the author provides a partial list of people he consulted while doing his research.Basically, all he did was take a sample of the most egregious stories from books such as All Too Human and Unlimited Access and weaves in with them a truckload of sordid second-hand rumors, and calls it an all-American love story.The so-called author should face charges for character assasination. I don't doubt that some of the stories are true, nor am I casting the President as a victim of someone else's lies. The greatest victim in this story is Truth itself."
1,Not at all fair.,I read the book and am writing to say it is not at all fair. Bill never cheated on Hillary with anyone but me. And he loved me. So there. The book is utter nonsense.
3,How to Date in the 90's,"I purchased this tome with an eye toward obtaining dating advice. What a wonderful book in that regard. I had no idea that most of the lines I was using were out-of-date, or entirely too clever for the average female. Why not just ask the women if they want to ""mess around in the back of my El-Camino."" Oh brother, this book is a gold mine, a virtual bevy, a veritable cornucopia of useful phrases and ideas to get overweight, un-attractive girls in the sack. Hats off (or better yet dresses off) to you MR. President."
3,A look into the dynamics of a relationship.,"I bought the book to get an idea of how the Clintons work and how they got where they are. What keeps them going, what keeps them together? I was not dissapointed but I was sadened by the insight. While the tale seems to hit the highlights of their journy together with more honesty than much of what is written about them, it is not spellbinding. I don't know if it the writing or the subject. As the Clinton presidency nears the end we may not have seen the last of their political ambition. It is worth reading in order to understand what drives this ambitious couple."
4,Questionable journalism but rings true,"As I read this book, two things struck me. First, the book is fast and loose in terms of journalistic standards. Second, however, is that, based upon what we do know, much of it rings true. The real question, and one that objective people will answer yes, is ""Do you think, based upon what we do know, that the Clintons are capable of this kind of behavior?"""
4,Hmmmm...,"The best way to read this book is to ponder what the American people should know about their politicians before they elect them to the highest offices. Those who dismiss this book as rumor overlook the extent to which so much which had been dismissed was corroborated over the past year.Would Clinton have been elected if Anderson had written this book in 1992? My suggestion, the answer is clearly no. To what extent should the press vette candidates before they're elected? If the New York Times had published this material before the New Hampshire primaries they would have been accused of attack dog politics, and yet better that than what the country went through last year."
2,It was...alright,"First, let me start with that I read Joshua Harris's book I Kissed Dating Goodbye first, and so when I read this one, I thought, ""Ugh."" TO me, it felt like this guy was trying to beat around the bush with dating. He gave a bunch of tips and nice little anecdotes, but it wasn't fulfilling. It didn't give the the info I wanted or needed. I'm kinda dissapointed I spent $10 on this when I could have bought Third Day's new album."
5,Are you dating??? Do you know why you date???-Check this,I Gave Dating a Chance by Jeramy Clark-Are you dating? Do you wish you were dating? Do you know why you date? Some profound yet quite true answers to these questions.This young adult man has done his research and come up with solutions to the age old dilemma of DATING.Do you want to find some answers to your own questions about dating? Are you the parent of a young teen and they want to date???? How to solidify your own ideas on dating and be able to communicate them clearly to another parent or student.
3,Just a Rebuttal,"Overall, I would say that many people do not understand what Joshua Harris has written in ""IKDG"" and ""Boy Meets Girl."" Harris, in both his books, says that the way we name our relationships with the opposite sex, i.e. dating vs. courting, has nothing to do with his message. He explicitly outlines that he supports, what he calls courtship--dating with a clear direction. Both authors support similar ideals, which is righteous courtship, so I don't see why this book was really written at all. However, Clark makes an effort to bash the ideals of Harris, even though both authors support the same ideas. They are arguing over word choice. Either book would lead you to similar conclusions. I recommend Harris' books for anyone who wants to understand how God wants us to lead relationships with others. All of his books are well written, include relavant stories, and have biblical backing."
3,Mixed feelings,"Jeremy Clark has some interesting insight about dating, and how people should approach it in a godly way. But I had a hard time agreeing with his view on when to date. He almost seem like dating is so casual that one doesn't have to wait that long before entering a dating relationship. The best thing I got out of the book was that if you're unsure about dating, there's no problem with waiting. I would recommend buying ""When Dreams Come True"" by Eric and Leslie Ludy instead for an awesome example on how to approach romantic relationships."
2,"Very noisy, poor output","Constant gurgling, boiling sounds. Loud enough to wake a heavy sleeper frequently. Poor output, high is barely sufficient for the amount of humidity I wanted. Avoid it."
3,An interesting read but dated theories,"This work, despite, being over one hundred years old, is still very readable. Though the work provides some interesting information on the origin of British folklore, much of its racial and ethnic thought is way outdated and borderline prejudiced. Also Gomme s dependence on what he calls survivalist, the idea that ancient beliefs have lingered on into the present day and become folklore is simply to much. However, as I said, despite its flaws this work is still immensely entertaining and also it is Avery interesting glimpse into some of the intellectual modes of thought that were current in academia cocaine hundred years ago."
3,Not Really For Beginners....,"Great song choices and great George Harrison intro, but not really a beginner's book. At least it was a little too hard for me."
1,Medium Duty? - NOT!,Blades damage easily - apparently not hardened steel. I purchased for home use - occasional light duty cutting of sheet metal and metal banding material used on lumber deliveries. Cutting was difficult and the blades damaged on the first cut of a metal band. Gardening or kitchen shears would have performed as well. Warning - use on soft materials only.
3,Rock Solid Raunch,"The three stars I've given this album belie it's greatness. Fact is, I gave Jones' later effort ""Neurotic Outsiders"" three stars as well, for the simple fact that neither of these albums are masterpieces.What they ARE, however, is blistering, straight-forward power chords at their finest. Overall, ""I Didn't See It Coming"" is patchy, but the good stuff is excellent indeed, particularly ""Payola"", ""Northern Slide"", ""Join The Professionals"", and my personal favourite, ""Mods, Skins, Punks"". ""Kamikaze"" is fine as well, sounding right up there with ex-Pistol material ""Silly Thing"" and ""No One Is Innocent"".The only downside? Like Johnny Thunders' debut LP, the production is spotty at times. ""Just Another Dream"" is an example of how to bury a perfectly good song in the mix.Buy it anyway."
4,big foot monster truck,It was a good movie to watch. Robert Hays and Art Carney where great. I loved it when the football game was in the bar. Also the mud race with the big foot monster truck.
3,Gives good basic information,"I bought this book because I know people who belong to different religions such as the Bahai faith but I didn't know much about them and more importantly how it differs from Christianity. It gave a good introduction and I got a basic understanding about the different faiths. However it wasn't entirely comprehensive, it only covered the major religions such as Catholicism, Mormonism and the like. So overall I think it's a good start if you're interested in learning about the other religions."
3,Some interesting points but also some errant information,"This book insinuates that the Talmudic Anti-Christ Jews are God's chosen people and that. Also, it does not point out the biblical requirements of baptism (emmersion) for the remmission of sins. Acts 2:38This book insinuates that one can be saved just by believing.How do you harmonize the following scripture?Faith without works is deadWe are not saved by worksTo harmonize these logically, one must conclude that works are required but by itself it cannot save.but this book does have some interesting points, and to the discerning mind, is a useful tool."
1,"Looking for Objective, Factual Information? Look Elsewhere!","Looking for objective, factual information about the world's major religions as I was? Look elsewhere!The title, ""So what's the Difference?"" is completely misleading. This is not a book of objective, factual information, but a book about the author's personal religious beliefs. If that isn't bad enough, I found the tone and content of the author's writing highly offensive. You will find complete intolerance and strident ridicule for the world's other major religions (as well as several major Christian denominations). Plain and simply, this is a book written by a bigot."
1,don't bother,Poor...wanted actual theological differences between religions...not skewed. I am a Christian but put little credence in this book...it is picky and critical of fellow Christians (Catholic) and makes the rest hard to swallow. Shallow!
3,I liked better previous editions,"This is a very great book, it gives you great insight on how to listen to people, and think in a very structured manner, and how to reply to others arguments. This book is used mostly as a text-book in schools, but it's still worth it to read it just for culture. This is the fifth edition and I think that the third one was better, it was more summarized, no need for drawings. In this new edition I was bored in the third chapter..."
5,Don't be a sponge!,"After reading ARQ and making its content an active part of my life, I was plucked from the world of passive sponges and dropped into the world of eager learners ""panning for gold."" I have never looked back.This book has had a tremendous impact on my learning experiences, both in and out of the classroom. I have learned not to simply accept the facts presented to me, but to question them in a systematic and logical fashion. Additionally, I now see the immense value of questioning both the convictions I agree with most intensely and those I disagree with most intensely. This critical thinking process enables me to understand the values and assumptions that shape my person.I would highly recommend ARQ to anyone wishing to learn the skills of an active, life-long learner."
1,Raiders of the Living Dead,In the name of GOD don't buy this movie. The cover art was better than the movie. (I use the term movie loosely) The acting was the worst thing I have ever seen. I have spent more money on a good dinner than was spent on the special effects for this (movie). I should have turned it off after the kid turned his Grand Fathers Laser Disk Player in to a death ray. The same effect used to beam people up in the old Star Trek TV series was used to make the laser beams. (scraching the film) After watching this (movie) I could not even bring myself to rewind it. It now sit on the self and I threaten to tie the kids up and make the watch it again if they act up.
4,cool early Stan v1,"Cool aloof and early Stan Getz with his glorious sound!There is another three CD set of Getz from this period the ""Complete Roost Recordings"", for $45 or so which more or less duplicates this. This one gets slight nod for the selection and sound (and it's 2 brothers), but if you have ""Roost"" & Getz ""Quartet"" you don't need this version, also.you can only pick between albums by song selection - some are ballads some are upbeat - all are Coolrecording quality is all over the place, frequently primitiveBy the way, the ""Complete"" Roost does not have all of these recordings, despite the title. Roost sound quality is a little better. Song selection is better in this collection, I think."
4,title is insightful,"This is one of the books that opened doors of influence for John Piper, I have heard him speak and read many of his books and I would say you must read this one. This book really encourages the reader to ""Desire God,"" of course this has to be born within you but he ""puts a fire"" through his writing in the reader."
3,God's Hedonist.,"The book makes me think seriously about my opinion and relationship with the heavenly Father. Many aspects were brought to my mind.Hedonism had always been negative but now I see it in a different light. I am glad to be/have the title.I am glad I had only the world view of hedonists. Now I have learned again, not to be so dogmatic"
4,Hedonism & a Christian's Quest for a Fulfilling Relationship with God,"I received Desiring God by John Piper from Waterbrook Multnomah with no strings attached other than to write an honest review of the book.As I've admitted in the past, I have a tough time reading this type of book, the ones that are going to show you the right way to find God, or know God's plan, or love God more, or... well you get the picture.I read Desiring God (this is the revised edition) and thought it was okay. I didn't get anything earth-shattering or ground-breaking from it.The one thing that I did get from the book is one of Piper's main points (or so it seems to me) that ""The chief end of man is to Glorify God by enjoying Him forever.""That's it, joy in knowing and loving and serving God.The rest of it just seems like a Christian view of Plato and Aristotle, which it probably isn't, but it strikes me that way right now.I will recommend this book because the pursuit of God is the most worthy thing that we can do."
4,Analogies Roundup,I like the way this book is organized. I like that it is ok to copy. The vocabulary is more advanced than I expected. My 4-6 graders will have a hard time with much of the vocabulary. It is better suited for Jr. High.
2,Disappointed,I was disappointed in the book. Typical fantasy. Good guys win. Bad guys lose. Women are strong. Men are emotional. I thought this was going to be a better book. It is not.
4,warrior 's salute to Gemmell,If U are a AD&D warrior in search of Blood to satisfy your war-lust. I bade u search no more as what U want is right here. Drink deep of the war and battle rages in the novel.
5,Great read. Excellent story!,"This book was a page turner. I could not put it down. David Gemmell is a great fantasy writer. I am saddened greatly by his death. He was one of the few fantasy writers left who could tell a great story in a single volume. For someone who has gotten really tired of multi-part stories this story is a breath of fresh air.On to the actual book. This story features three main characters, four if you count Dace. Gemmell develops each character sufficiently to make you care about what happens to them. The story involves swords, magic and a good story. All you could ever want in a book."
1,"Too Much Sheet Music, Too Little Teaching","The first 15 pages are nothing more than you get in thousands of other books and free on many internet sites. The rest of the book is songs in tabulature. I expected the book to teach me how to play the songs. And, when I try to play the songs, I find the small print tabulature very hard to read."
5,Teach Yourself Bluegrass Guitar,I like it and it is good for my needs. It is a helpful learning book for my level of learning.
1,The Viewer Who Screamed,"Marty Beck is a ""master horror writer"" who decides to lease a haunted house in which to write his newest novel. Although he doesn't believe in ghosts, he hopes the atmosphere will rub off on his writing. The only frightening thing about this movie is that the ""filmmakers"" actually got the money to do it. The community theater acting, terrible script, lifeless directing, and cheesy special effects (just love the opening suicide where the woman blows her oatmeal... I mean, her brains against the window) scream for Mystery Science Theater treatment. While I strongly support independent films and understand the endless obstacles one confronts trying to make one, a dog is still a dog. Don't waste your time or money on this."
1,Beyond Bad,"This movie was so horrible I don't even remember what it was about, except that it truly sucked. Before I bought this movie I failed to check out who this movie was made by: BRAIN DAMAGE. Any Brain Damage movie will suck, so beware, however.... I did sort of enjoy ""Hell's Highway"". It kept my interest and was very gory. But that's about the only Brain Damage movie that I've like so far."
1,Disappointed,One star only because site does not allow 0 stars.Vendor listed cell phone battery as NEW - IT WAS NOT. Will not hold charge for more than 2 hours after fully charging.This was an Amazon affiliate vendor.
1,Horrible Purchase,I purchased the battery back in september for my phone. I was under the impression it was a brand new battery. Nothing on the description said it was used or refurbished. When I put it in my phone it did not work. So I thought there was a bigger problem with my phone and I brought it to my service provider. They said the battery was definetly old and used. They said it clearly had water damage. (The battery not my phone) I decided it wasn't worth the hassel of a return because I only paid 11$. I ended up throwing it away and having to buy another battery.
1,Not Good,"I purchased this battery after reading both the positive and negative reviews. Some are happy with the battery, and others are not. I'm one of those who are unhappy with the purchase. The performance of the battery was about the same as my old battery or even worse. I ordered it through the seller with the highest feedback rating so shipping was fast, but unfortunately the product was not good. It's silly to worry about the performance of the battery which is supposed to be new. My battery died in 10 minutes or so with the purchased battery when I talked on the phone. I went to a local VerizonWireless store and purchased a new one, and it's great. It's like having a new cell phone again."
1,COMPLETE JUNK - a wast of time!,"This is total junk. The date code on the battery that Amazon sent me was OLDER than the one that I was replacing! It worked more poorly than the battery that I was replacing! I had to go to my Verizon store to get a NEW one with this month's date code.Amazon, WHY would you do this? It dumps your credibility into the crapper!"
3,LG Battery not as good as new.,"I ordered this battery to replace my old one until I eventually get a new cell phone. The old battery was running out before 5 PM even when I had not spoken with anyone. This new? battery does not have the capacity my original battery had when new even though it looks the same. One night, the battery went out in the middle of a call at about 9 PM. Note that I recharge my battery every night for at least 7 to 8 hours with the phone turned off. I also usually do not spend more then one hour a day on my cell phone."
4,junk batteries or not!,I puchased two of these OEM batteries for a 1.75 each plus 1.99 shipping and right from the start one battery would not hold a charge at all and within a week the other battery would not hold a charge as good as my four year old batteries that I was replacing! I sent a message to the seller with no response so the next best thing to do was to let people know about what happened when I bought the cheap batteries and got cheap batteries so shop arround and you can find good batteries at a little higher price!NOTE! After posting the review above the seller responded and replaced the defective batteries and the replacement batteries work Great! so far so good !
2,Was Doubtful,"Took out of a zip baggie(the battery came in) and inserted into my phone.I didn't use the phone until the battery recieved a complete charge.Turned on the phone and 4 bars changed to one BAR!!!Made a phone call..Call lasted 4 mins..Decided to charge again and again..Short talktimes again.After 8 or more un disturbed charges and 3 days,the battery seems to have come to life and is now sustaining a 2 hour talktime..Bar still quickly falls from 4 bars to 2 bars,,though..The battery is under 5 dollars and should remain under 5 dollars.Shouldn't take 3 or more days just to get a 2 hour talktime charge."
2,No Charge When Received,This battery had no charge at all upon receipt. Charged the battery and put in my phone. Not sure it will meet my expectations yet.
2,Shipping Charges,"I made the mistake of ordering 2 batteries at the same time. To my astonishment , I was charged almost $10.00 dollars shipping ( Normal shipping was $5.00 ). Both batteries were received in the same very small package ( the same package that would have been used to ship one battery for $5.00 ). Upon complaint to Amazon they informed me that their software was unable to process shipping charges reasonably, and I was simply stuck with the totally unreasonable shipping charges.Note to Amazon: I maybe stuck with your authorized shipping charges, but fortunately I'm not stuck with having to purchase from Amazon again. Amazon GET REAL !"
3,LG replacement battery,"Received the battery on time but haven't tried it as yet as I bought it for my dad to replace the old one in his LG phone. It looks new and unused, so lets hope it works as it should."
3,so so replacement battery,"It's better than nothing, will hold charge for a day or two, just enough for my need. Considering it's only a couple of bucks, you get what you paid for."
1,Battery nearly dead,"I have no problem with the shipping. The battery came within a few days. BUT, it seems to be worse than the battery I am replacing. It doesn't hold a charge for long. One phone call of a few minutes puts the low battery icon on two bars. The package wasn't factory sealed, so I am just not sure if it is really brand new. I am currently using another battery. This one is junk."
1,Not worth the money,"My cell phone battery was requireing a charge everyday. So i thought I would replace it. I found this battery on Amazon. I figured for about 10 bucks, it was worth the gamble. The battery arrived and I could tell it was used before, because the contacts were well worn. Overall, the packaging of the item looked like my orginal battery. It charged up, and for the first two weeks performed much better than my orginal battery. After about 6 weeks, it would not hold a charge. I was back in the same situation as I started. It only cost be about 10 dollars, so I am not too upset. I am disappointed with this purchase and will not recommend to others to make similiar purchases."
5,Great Deal,This was a great buy and the time it took to arrive was amazing. Not only was the product itself up to par but the service by Amazon was outstanding!
3,Good product with limited use,I returned this product as I did not realize when ordering that it did not have a cigarette/power point attachment which is the only way I intended on using it. It MUST be attached to the battery which is sometimes not too convenient. Otherwise it appeared to be a good product.
1,Superflow MV50 Air compressor,"I'm sorry I can only give this piece of junk a one star instead of a zero. This thing lasted LESS that seven minutes intermittent use before it melted a hole in the yellow air line. It melted a hole in the air line just as I finished putting air in the fourth tire on a mid size automobile. Quite a bit less than the forty minutes of max use they recommend before letting it cool. In forty minutes this thing would melt to the ground from heat. Now it is totally useless to me. I have sent two emails to Q Industries, the company that represents this junk, from their own website and I have made two phone calls to them and left voice mails both times and I still haven't heard ANYTHING from them. I wouldn't have their product if they gave me all I could use. Pretty bad when you buy a brand new product and the first time you use it it breaks and can't even get a response from the company reps."
3,"Decent pump, bad pressure gauge","Got to try this pump out in the real world.. overall, I was able to air up 4 tires from 15psi to 38 in about 15 minutes. The pump gets a little hot towards the end, but overall it was pretty good. However, the pressure gauge is unusable and reads at least 10 psi higher than the actual pressure of the tire.Not a bad pump for the money but make sure you have a pressure gauge."
2,"Good power, but totally worthless in-line fuse holder","This compressor does a good job, but the in-line fuse holder is worthless. Melted on me after the 2nd time I used it. Only aired up about 3 tires before it went kaput. Thank goodness I wasn't in the desert. I bought it to use out in the middle of nowhere. Anyway, I replaced the fuse holder with a good one, and it works good. Also, it works a little faster if you have the vehicle idling while you running it."
3,"Seems OK, but....",Unit runs and puts out good volumes of air as advertised but makes some noises while doing it that make me wonder how long it will last. I guess time will tell.
3,Setup time is a hassle,"I purchased the SuperFlow at a local auto store and was later surprised to find out they were charging thirty dollars more than Amazon. Aside from the price I found the unit had plenty of power, it seems very sturdy and well built and seems like it would last for awhile. In order to use it you must attach it to your battery using terminal clips, and you also have to attach the filter, screw the hose onto your tire, and run back from your tire to where the guage is which is half-way between where your tire is and where your battery is. This seems like quite a hassle to use, especially if using in winter. I used it once and determined due to the higer price, and the hassle of use and setup time that I would return to the auto parts store. Again it is well built and has power, so if the setup time does not matter to you then this might be a good choice for you."
1,Q Industries out of business?,"When calling for support from the owner's manual on this product, I get a ""telephone service is no longer connected"" message with no forwarding phone number. Also went to the Q Industries website and checked the number there and it also didn't work. There was no way to get support from the website.Be very careful here. My battery or charger died after 8 months and there appears to be no way to contact the manufacturer.Wonder if Amazon will honor a return after 8 months. Probably not."
1,Unreliable,"This product either works or it doesn't for me. I periodically fill up my tires and almost always have an issue whether it is a blown fuse, cable comes off the alligator clamp, or just doesn't want to work. Like today I wanted to fill up four tires and I was able to do 3 with no problem. When I went to turn it on for the 4th tire it just did not come on. I changed the fuse, moved the clamps around... nothing worked. I have also emailed the company in the past with no response. The screw on connector is a pain at times, you have to fill up more air in the tire because you lose a lot of it while unscrewing the connector. Think it is time to find another compressor."
1,WORST TOASTER EVER!!!,This is my second Cuisinart toaster. I must say they didn't make a big fuss when I called and said that the first one kicked the bucket. They sent another one in the mail. I thought just maybe it was THAT toaster. I was wrong we've had the new one for about two months now and the toast is getting more burnt on one side and the other isn't even brown. The last one did the same thing and then one side quit working. I don't recomend this product. It's ashame that a company like cuisinart with such a good reputation can't make a toaster that actually works.
4,Great toaster,"I am very pleased with this toaster,not only is it great looking but it works great too.It has nice wide slots for bagels,and several settings for how brown you want your toast.I would buy another."
4,Good Product Worth Buying,"I have had very good luck with this toaster. It is easy to operate, the toast stays centered and the results are generally good. The only flaw I have found is that in the single slice toast mode, one side gets darker than the other, but not to the point of charring. Overall, the toaster is well made and functional."
4,A good dancing shoe,"In general it is a comfortable dancing shoe. One thing I like to point out about its size and width. I read some review saying that its size is smaller and its width is narrower than standard. I found its size and width is quite match or close to the standard. I originally order a half size bigger and extra wide size shoe. At the end I finally change to half size smaller and the same extra width. In fact I could used the ""wide size"" which is my normally width size instead of the extra width. With the extra width I felt a little bit loose yet I can put on a thicker sock."
4,nice fit,"my street size in most shoes is 8 - 1/2, but I am a little wide.These really do appear to be accurately a street size.I did order the Wide and they fit fine.I did decide to go with this model instead of the leather bottoms. (which these the suede sole)So they won't last as long as if you get the leather soled ones.And you should not even walk out to your car in them. put on after you enter the building where you are going to dance.They are comfortable, nice heal fit.They will take a few dance sessions to break in the crease for the top of your foot, but you only will notice when you are concentrating on it. When you are dancing it should be fine, or at least it was for me.I would recommend these shoes, and would purchase again. I may go to the full leather sole, but they cost more of course."
2,Not a fan,"I thought this video was more a kin to tourcher rather then entertainment. My son will watch it, but I think the songs miss the mark and are hard to listen too. I like the other language movies more and will be chucking this one to find a better, less annoying german tape.Kids sing the songs on the tape, but the words don't slow well and makes it sound awful."
2,Viva Pinata,Game is too complex for 6-8 years old. Some instructions would help too! The kids get bored with it very quickly. Instead buy Lego Star Wars. My grandson plays Lego Star Wars for days at a time and never gets bored.
5,Additictive and Fun,"This game defines what it means to be an 'addictive game' with lots of tasks to do that start off easy and slowly build up. The tasks in the game are varied from planting flowers to growing huge trees, from keeping track of tiny worms to finding space for a stable of horses or huge grizzly bears. There are lots of little elements that make it challenging like how to keep out some of the 'bad' guys from your garden, how to turn the 'bad' guys into 'good' pinata, and how to make some of the strange combinations like Jack-o-Lanterns or carrot cake.I actually play it with my girlfriend because she's addicted to playing it as well.The game is a lot better than I had expected so it's been a great gift."
3,Viva Yo Momma,"Viva Pinata is exciting, cute, and fun. The most vivid game for the Xbox360 yet. However, it has some flaws. The annoying tutorial being one of them. Once you're on your own though, thats it. You're on your own. Sometimes you find you're supposed to do something, and then, you wonder how you're supposed to do it. An example of this was how I needed long grass, but I had no idea how to get it. I didn't find out until hours later that you had to buy it from the shop. There are several other instances of confusion like that, but the game is still very fun and unique. If you like games such asThe Sims 2, you might enjoy this game."
4,Nice for the price,"This is a little workhorse. It is metal so there are not plastic pieces that will get brittle as the machine ages. The only flaw that I see if when you do a ""z fold"" the pages drop into themselves so you have to either separate each one or you have to sit in front of it and catch each one. Other than that, it works like a charm."
5,The production was groovy!,"The whole things that's cool about this film is it melds the conventions of a court room drama with the time-honored and beloved theme of demon possession. Plus, there is some truly freakish, over the top performances by a character who is a mystic and some corpulent broad that's a voodoo sorceress. You just have to check it out."
1,Poorly Made,"This product was poorly made. It did not work with any smoothness. It also had a feel of cheapness. I was quite surprised based on my previous history with Bessey products (clamps). You know what they stay, stick to your knitting, well Bessey missed the boat on this one."
3,Catapult activity kit.,"This was for a school prodject for my son. It was to fragile an item to be really useful, so we just built one ourselves. Haven't really used catapult yet but maybe it will come in handy somewhere. Can't really rate it since we haven't put it together to use it."
2,Broke pretty quickly.,"Wasn't hard to set up, but it was a bit rickety and didn't work as well as we'd hope. Then it broke. What a let down."
3,Teeny cookies,"The cookies taste good, though not as good as the manafacturer's description suggests. My problem with them is that I thought I was buying something relatively healthy and low fat. However, a bag is not a serving size (and it is a small bag with about 7 little cookies inside). A serving size is 2 cookies and they are small. I inevitably eat the whole bag (because once you've opened it you can't reseal it and they are good enough to make you want more than just two). The serving size really should be 4 cookies, and they need to package it accordingly."
2,It's an old story to me.,"I am 24years old Japanese. This book was pretty interesting to me when I saw it at the bookstore by accident because I moved to california from Japan a couple of years ago.While I was reading the book, I was kinda confused because almost everything what she wrote about Japanese culture seemed like old stuff to me. I don't want people who read this book to believe everything. In my opinion, she exaggerated the fact too much(I'm not saying about her family, but Japanese culture).She hasn't live in Japan for twenty years, so she doesn't know well what's going on in Japan NOW. People and Culture have changed a lot. She wrote the old facts about Japanese culture as if those are going on right now. She just lived in old Japan."
5,"Great, accurate information on Anton LaVey's life",This is the book you need to read if you wish to know the man who formed the world's most notorious religion. The most up to date information available.
2,Random,"I listened to Naipaul's nobel lecture, and found many of the things he touched on in that speech echoed in this short work. Naipaul speaks at length about growing up in Trinidad, and of the people he encounters. He speaks about his education. He also speaks about his father's short stories. Reading this book gives one a good sense of what led Naipaul to his first novels, as well as what led him to his later ones. The somewhat puzzling ending wraps up the writer's pessimism re: the future of the novel, which I found disingenuous. It's both unconvincing and the ultimate ingratitude to the form that won him the Nobel Prize."
4,Cute,The Happy Bunny series makes for cute bathroom books - I keep them in my guest bathroom and find it amusing to hear laughter from there when people use it! :)
2,"No accounting for taste, I guess...","I very much looked forward to reading this, seeing as it contains stories by pros which were chosen by OTHER pros as their favorites. Aside from the first story by Sturgeon (The Man Who Lost the Sea), which is a fascinating example of how to tease the reader, I thought this was a very poor collection. I seriously question whether the authors actually chose the stories themselves, or if they just lent their names to this book. Also, ""The Black Bag"" is one of the most amateurish stories I've ever read."
3,Not what I expected,"I was a bit disappointed. I thought the table was going to be a bit higher based on measurements. The table itself is made of sturdy wood and easy to assemble. My only other qualm is the allen wrench. Also I cannot get the legs tight enough to stop them from wobbling. So, I had to add a bolt between the screw. I probably won't buy another table from dinette direct again."
4,Great summer reading,"I loved this book when I was younger! I actually read it in the summer time. This book was so interesting and funny and the main character had such a great personality and it showed how at times, when everything seems like it's going wrong in life, which seems like always in a kids life, you have to be optimistic!"
5,Desert Island Chopin,"A disc to treasure. 10 Mazurkas beautifully played by Michelangeli, and staggering performances of the G-Minor Ballade and B-flat minor Scherzo, all in superb sound. I recall when this recital was issued on LP that most critics panned it. I don't know why. It has always been one of the outstanding Chopin collections and one of Michelangeli's finest achievements. Put this alongside the Testament 2 CD live recital (with the Schumann Carnaval), and the Ravel and Debussy recordings as perhaps this great pianist's finest recorded legacies."
2,Doesn't get hot enough,I got this one to replace an identical unit that finally quit after about 6 years and which had been excellent until it finally failed. But this unit did not heat the coffee enough and the coffee always tasted weak. I sent it back.
3,TOO SHORT... BUT SWEET,"A VIDEO OF SUPERB VISUAL QUALITY. UNLIKE EXCELLENT BRUCE LEE DOCUMENTARIES: ""CURSE OF THE DRAGON"", AND ""MARTIAL ARTS MASTER"", WHOSE DIALOG FREEFLOWS FROM THOSE INTERVIEWED IN ILLUMINATING AND INFORMATIVE FASHION, THIS DOCUMENTARY FAILS, BY HOLDING THOSE INTERVIEWED ON LEE TO QUICK AND LIMITED STATEMENTS, PERMITTING COMMENTS PERTAINING ONLY TO THE DOCUMENTARIES PRE-SCRIPTED AND HURRIED AGENDA.AS AN ORIGINAL MADE FOR TELEVISION PIECE WITH TIME CONSTRAINTS, IT RUSHES ALONG, CRAMMING EVERYTHING INTO A SET TIME SLOT OF ONLY 50 MINUTES, SIMPLY DISPLAYING WHAT LEE DID IN HIS LIFE, WITHOUT EXAMINING THE DEPTH OF THE MAN HIMSELF WITHIN THESE EVENTS. A NICE APPETIZER, DEFINATELY NOT THE FULL COURSE."
4,"Tons of information, some outdated","Overall this book had a a lot of very good information. I have ordered all of my new supplements and will begin my new plan soon. I like the way the book is organized and the charts she gives are very helpful in figuring out how much of each supplement to take.However, some of the information is outdated. My edition was published in 1999 and now 14 years later, things have changed. The book says over and over that tryptophan is only available by Rx but in 2002 Tryptophan was brought back to market in the US. You can now purchase tryptophan at any health food store."
3,Limited Diet,"The book is very interesting and certainly has merit. Most of the diet recommendations would not work for me because of dairy, cholesterol, sugar, and arthritis issues.If the author could find a diet that more people could be on or more choices in the diet, I might have followed it.I did take the time to fill out the questions, and found the results interesting. Worth getting the book, just for this."
3,Butterfly Tote,"Fantastic delivery time!!! The tote bag is a little thin for a ""Tote Bag"", and for kids who tend to be a little rougher on things. But, my grand-daughter had a blast making the design and being able to personalize it was, to her, the best thing!!"
1,False Adverising,Advertised as a 7 Hole punch It is delivered with only three punch pads so it can only punch 3 holes at a time
5,just duckey,"happy with unit and it works very well.it has ease of use,it is very heavy duty,and can by stored easily."
3,not 7 hole on its own,i ordered this because i needed a 7 hole punch. No instructions were included. It was obviously one that someone returned and after looking online you have to buy more punch heads to make it a 7 hole punch. I am keeping it only because I can still use it as the 3 hole punch that it really is. Also then they can't send it to some one else. My advice - buy a hand held hole punch and punch the 7 holes that way.
3,"Cannot use. Soldered into ""locked"" position. Puncher won't punch.","******Updated: after trying for a while, saw gray on gray arrows...and was able to use product. Great product once you can move the handle up to punch! Would be 5 stars if better instructions.Great handle, lightweight. However, the handle is SOLDERED into a ""locked"" position, making this no more than a paperweight. I tried moving the slider to the left, to unlock, as the arrows showed. Alas, when checking underneath, noticed a piece of metal soldered, making it impossible to unlock the handle and actually punch any papers. What good is a three hole paper punch that won't punch paper? None for me.Great amazon service and delivery, but I'll be returning this one. Sometimes, you just need a little punch!"
3,"Great protection, but heavier than expected.","Don't get me wrong. The case does its job. Very sturdy, very cool... it protects the shuffle great. It is a bit heavier than expected. Another review mentioned a noticeable difference before the case and with the case. That's true. The weight is noticeable. I'll use it when I work out/go running, or when I am travelling. The rubber pad that protects the wheel click makes it harder to click. By this, I mean that you have to put in a little extra effort when you push the buttons, a noticeable difference from the ease of the button without the case. It's a neat product,.... I was hoping to always have it on... but I don't think I'll be doing that now."
3,Headset Extension Cable Faulty,The sport case comes with a small extension cable for use with non-iPod headsets. The whole at the bottom of the case for headsets is too small for most headset connectors except the ones that come with the iPod (Apple Flavor). My cable was broken out of the box. The case itself is high quality and is what I expected. It is going to be a real pain to try and find and replace the extension cable. I wear hearing aids so I have to have over the ear and not in the ear headsets. If you like the iPod headset or have a 3rd party set that will fit in the little hole then this product is very nice.
2,Buyer beware!,"This case cost almost half of what my iPod cost, but I chose it because I felt it had the Apple reputation behind it. It's been 3 months and the latch broke. Bummer. Too long for an Amazon return but well within the 1 year warranty period. Please note: Apple WILL NOT stand behind their warranty when purchased from Amazon (or any third party reseller).The case gets 2 stars because it had merits. It's a great waterproof case that served me well in its short life. Only drawback other than durability is the need to use an easy to lose earphone pigtail (included) when using earphones other than the stock iPod ones."
1,cold coffee,"My office bought this coffeemaker because it looks nice. Which it does, unfortunately unless you drink the very first cup immediately after it is brewed your coffee will be lukewarm at best. There is no automatic shut off which in a ""commercial"" type coffeemaker should be standard. The lid is not a ""flip-up"" like most, it screws on, which I guess is nice if you are walking around with a coffeepot in your hands, but who does that. The screw on lid does make it hard to pour water into the top of the maker completely because some water is always stuck under the lip, it also makes pouring coffee difficult. Overall, you'd be much better spending $20 on a much cheaper model with better features."
1,Waste of Money,"Why on earth someone has produced this so-called documentary (other than earning easy money) I don't understand. Imagine a 45 minutes of documentary where almost 30 minutes are spent with Madonna leaving the make-up truck on the set of Body of Evidence. The biography is in no correct order and there is mis-information all the way through. They say she was born in 1957, that she was married to Sean Penn in 1980 (!!!) and so on... Nothing new, nothing unseen. Totally a waste of money."
1,Waste of money!,This is a low budget documentary that is very poorly done. The seller does not describe what you are buying very well. Don't waste your money here like I did.
3,"NIce looking, OK performance","Frankly, I expected more from Haier. This is basically a dorm-fridge, with a glass door, and digital temperature display. It looks very nice, an my wife is thrilled -- which is what matters most. It sits on ceramic tile in my TV room, and the noise, while present, is not bothersome. I am a bit less happy with the constant 5-6 degree temperature variation. Needs better insulation, I shudder to think how much electricity its eats!"
2,smell when open the door,"when i opened the door,very strong plastic smell come out.and it was broken package when i received it."
5,Great for any office,The porcelain board is the only way to go. Easy to erase and not ghosting! I do recommend special markers from Quartet as we have had the best performance from them versus generic or general use markers.
1,Audible hum,"These speakers have a hum that is quite audible and unpleasant, even when the volume is at zero. Another reviewer also had this problem. Either it is a manufacturing defect, or poor design, but a $25 speaker shouldn't suffer from this problem. For this reason, I recommend not purchasing this speaker."
2,all in,spent too much time on a historical perspective -- it would have taken five minutes at the start to tell this story. too little time spent on the thievery of the prof and jesus ferguson.very disappointing
4,Awesome Gorefest,"First of all, I would like to say that this screen name that i am writing under is not mine because i don't have a credit card. Secondly, i've watched a lot of horror movies and this is in my top 5. Not many horror movies have left me thinking about it for hours after i have watched it but this one did. For a low budget horror film it sure is very creepy and alot of horror movies out now can't even hold a candle to a film such as this. Whether you are a fan of cradle of filth, dani filth or just good gory horror movies you need to check this one out!"
3,Stunning! But Not Shot on Film...,"I really really like this flick. But it is NOT a film. It is not shot on film and therefore is a very effective episodic horror genre piece shot on what looks like high definition video and digital video.The effects are great. It has a really awesome aura about it and the gore is way over the top and fun. However, this presentation would be 100 times better shot on film. The trailer makes it look like it is in fact shot on film but when watching it the constant switching between video textures is quite annoying.But I gotta say, the flick is really fun, gory, twisted. It would be all these things and more if it had a better score and had been filmed.But saying all that I really love it ultimately. But I can tell that it would have scared me out of my wits had the presentation been altered."
3,A decent shot on video horror,"The first things people who watch this will notice is that this movie is shot on video(maybe due to not having alot of money to make it). It looks a little like a horror soap opera. Now on to the film itself. It stars Dani Filth(from the band cradle of filth) as a demon who goes around killing for his father who is in jail for multiple murders. The acting in this movie ranges from really bad to just average. The gore and effects are pretty well done with a few exceptions(watch the dolls get thrown from the car crash scene to see what i mean,among others). Plenty of blood,guts and nudity to go around. Not the best horror out there but you could do alot worse then this movie. It is a fun ride while it last just dont expect a masterpeice of horror cinima. I got the feeling if the director wouldve had more money to work with this movie would be an easy 5 star horror. Dani Filth was not as bad as i thought he would be."
1,Too much detail. But not helpful,"It provides a lot of detail. But the flow of the writing is very bad, so understanding is really hard"
1,Awful.,"This is one of the worst books ever written in the English language. The author should read ""Creative Writing for Complete Morons"" and then never write another word."
3,"Poorly Written, Events not in Sequence",Did anyone bother to proof read this book. The author is talking about one character but then one of the other characters' name appears. The events jump from one occurance to another with explanation. I always loved Cait London but this book is not a reflection of her writings. It is never really explained why the Warrens are so hated in the town. A few occurrences are mentioned but nothing that would make the entire town of Madrid hate them so. There are other events that are not well explaine at all.
1,"Nice pictures, no instruction","This book was nice to look at, but aside from some accessories, there were no instructions other than to use a favorite pattern. Please! The clothes would look nice on some people, but not for most of us, and nowhere does the author address how you keep reversible blouses clean, since you can't very well put underarm shields in them.You would be better off getting Sewing Express by Nancy Zieman, or buying some of Jasmine Hubble's books.This book needs a deep discount, or be republished with instructions!"
1,Will sell for free :-),"My trail of bad movies continues with this sucker! I can challenge the director that I can do better CGI than what they cobbled together for this movie. First, movies like this make fun of legitimate technologies and then they abuse viewers by giving it a cool name. Anyway, the movie is a modern take on Innerspace but the graphics in the 20 year old original were better than these.Stay away!"
2,already seen!,"This movie ripps of an old classic i saw when i was young, about shrinking people and an innerspace ship then injecting a pateint. the first was to kill a tumor i beleive but this one is to stop a nano detonation device. its kinda lame , especially if you've seen this story line before."
5,it really works!,"My son is 2 1/2. I've tried to ""old"" method for a while now. The first day was difficult trying to keep him on task, especially when he just wanted to play w/ his toys. It took us 2 days, but by day 3 he was p/p self-initiating all day w/ no accidents! I'd recommend this any day!"
4,Definately worth reading!,"It took more than a day, but, the method worked better than anything else that we tried. Our daughter, who is now 2 years old, had to be toilet trained fully in order to get into pre-school. We ran out and bought this book as the start date came closer. After a few weeks she was trained - as in - no training pants, no pull ups, goes herself without help from any adult. While it wasn't quite this miracle cure that the book's cover said it would be... I am certain that it was what made the difference in the end."
1,potty training based on bribery ?,"If I had known that I would have to buy a doll and ""treats"" to potty train my child , I would never have bought this book. Outdated method to say the least!"
3,unrealistic,"The book is easy to read and makes perfect sense, but is unrealistic. It states that for one full day the child can have no distractions like television or games, toys, etc... so that he can focus solely on drinking liquids and going to the potty. My 2 and a half year old is a very active boy who plays all day and it would be seriously impossible to keep him contained or away from his toys. This just isn't the right approach for me."
1,Less Than A Day,"Did you ever seek knowledge of a book and wish that it would just get to the point?!!?!?!? That's how I found this book. As small as it is, it went on and on for what seemed like forever about why traditional toilet training doesn't work. Okay, well...DUH! That's why I bought this book! To try to learn a new method! The part that actually talks about this ""less than a day"" method took less than 2 minutes to read and in scant detail. I just think that if this is the method you want to advertise (and also want to advertise how easy it is the way they do) than you should probably clearly outline the steps in a specific chapter. It's up to you, but I wouldn't waste the money!"
2,Needs updating,"As others have said, this 30-year-old book is in desperate need of a new edition. That aside, I this method did not work for my son. We had tried traditional potty training for a few weeks prior to this method and he had been resistant. Therefore, he was resistant to thismethod too - he knew what was going on and didn't want any part of it. I think this method can only work if your child has had no potty experience whatsoever."
1,Not Good for Stubborn A Child,"I am sure this book worked mircles for other parents, but for menot a all.My daugther for the record was 2 years old and does listen to simple instructions from me when give. But when I tried to teach her to use the potty with the methods in the book. She wasn't having it. She played with the potty doll they recommend you buy ,so the child can teach the doll then learn themselves. She told the doll to go potty, but wouldn't go herself, even after drinking all kinds of liquids and with hours of encouragement. So if you have a stubborn child who is dtermined to do what they want when they want DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY. DO IT THE OLD FASHION WAY PATIENCE AND ALOT OF PRAYING."
2,Works for all kids????,"My daughter is 2 1/2 and she is not using the potty yet.. I got this book because I read good things about it on here. I got it, I did what it said, and I got NOWHERE. My daughter is delayed by a few months in her verbal communications but isnt slow by any stretch of the imagination and she didnt understand what was going on enough to get it. The potty baby was just another baby to her. She held herself the whole time she was on the potty and cried for a diaper.. She fit all the milestones and such but this didnt work for her. Dont buy it if your child is comfortable only in their diaper. My daughter wont pee in the tub or anything.. she cries for a diaper. I wouldnt buy it if your child is like this."
2,nothing new that is not available on the web,I thought I would learn something from experts that I could not by surfing the web. This is not true. The book is not well written and doesn't have any useful advice (at least for me!).
4,Like The Results - Path Not-as-Much,"I 'liked it' because most of the methods seem to match the newer child psychology findings and (when tailored a bit for our son) worked very well (and we used a more spaced out, relaxed pace). I recommend running through it to grab the techniques that reinforce:- focusing on helping the child understand that using the potty is good and makes you happy- encouraging the child to do ALL steps by themselves... yes, even the big blobs of poo... barehandedIt helped.I wanted to give it a bit of a lower rating because: the obvious sexist assumptions. But I guess the stereotypes displayed were more common-place in the era this book was first published. Take the useful information and forget the rest!"
1,Potty Boot Camp,"This book gave totally unrealistic expectations about how long it takes to potty train a child. It makes you feel that if your child does not get it in the four hours or less they say most children get it in you are inadequate. My child is 2 and 1/2 and did not respond well to the methods used in this book. The constant pressure that this book suggests to use made her less willing to use the potty than before we started this training. If you want to put your child through high intensity ""potty boot camp"" than this is the book for you, but I would not recommend it to anyone!"
1,Waste of Money,The copywrite date is 1974 and this says alot about the book. I am an early childhood educator and can tell you that this does not align with current theories. It emphasises punishments for accidents and requires you stay in the kitchen with the child for the entire day pumping him/her full of liquids. I wish I hadn't wasted the money on this extremely outdated book!
5,God-send!,"My 3yo son would only occassionally tell me he had to go to the potty. After trying every technique and ""trick"" (everything from putting Cheerios in the toilet to putting on fun underwear and of course praise)and being left extremely frustrated, I bought this book. First I used it cutting corners and not following it completely...and it didn't work. Then I got serious and followed the techniques to the T. Worked like a charm!"
2,Not all kids are alike,"I had heard this book raved about, and when potty training time came about, I figured I had to have it. What I found I really needed to have was a good understanding of my daughter - not this book, which seems to assume that all children are the same and that all children learn the same. I found it condescending and pushy at times, and sometimes its instructions made me downright uncomfortable. If you are preparing to potty train, I would recommend a few potty training books for kids featuring your child's favorite characters - they will have much more impact on your child (along with your nurturing and understanding) than the instructions in this book."
5,This is the best method for boys,"I was given a remaindered copy of this book 25+ years ago and made the mistake of not reading it in time to train my first son. It was a long, painful process with him. I had 4 more boys and, with the second, dreaded toilet training when he got to that age. I dredged this book out and figured I had nothing to lose and I was right. This worked like a charm with my 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th sons.Toilet training is not fun and you really do need to take some time out to read the book before hand and be prepared, but this gets the job done (no pun intended) efficiently, effectively, and left my sons trained for night time as well. I just didn't believe it would work, but it did. I have been recommending it to people for a quarter of a century and no one who has used it properly has anything but praise for it."
5,Used this method with all my children & it works,"I have 3 boys with very strong personalities. My oldest is now almost 16 and I had a terrible time training him. I spent an entire year working with him and was only able to get him to urinate on the tree out front! I was given a copy of Toilet Training in Less than a Day and went through the exercises first for stubborn children. When it came time to potty train, it only took a couple of hours and we had no relapses. I used this method with my next two children with the same success. It only took a couple of hours and there were no relapses. I highly recommend using this method of potty training."
5,A lovely book for toilet training,"I used this book with both of my boys (who, I might mention, were very stubborn with regard to toilet training). It is the nicest way of toilet training that I have ever heard of. At the end of the four hour period(which is quite enjoyable) my child was happy and very proud of himself. He was actually strutting around he was so proud of himself -- too cute! The only comment I have heard is that people cut off the treats too soon. You should continue with some treats for a week after you finish the toilet training -- by that time it is ingrained in their bodies what to do.I would highly recommend this book. Make sure you read it yourself and get all the little things they tell you to get ahead of time. It's not a 'read as you go' book. But it's worth every cent!"
2,Authors are living in a dream world!,"I'd like to buy a one-way ticket to the fantasy world these authors are living in. I find it highly unlikely that 98% (they claim) of all children can be potty-trained in 4 hours or less. I tried this technique on my 2 1/2 year old daughter and the whole process became a constant power struggle with lots of frustration and no real results after almost 2 weeks. Sure it may work for some kids who are particularly cooperative and responsive, but if your toddler is like mine (very bright but independent, strong-willed, likes to do things on her own) I think you will be disappointed in this very aggressive approach. You're better off asking some real parents their approaches to potty training and see what works for your child. Don't waste your money."
2,Chinese made version of an old standby,"I have used punches that looked exactly like this Master 325B in schools and business for 40 years. They were accurate, reliable, took a lot of abuse and lasted forever. Well, this is not that punch. It's a classic poorly made version outsourced to China or an outright Chinese imitation. I can't which say as I never noticed whose name was on the many previous ones I'd used. You'd be better off finding an old used one made in the US than this one. I now regret passing on the Sparco SPR01796 which has seven 5-star Amazon reviews as of this writing and sells for half the price or less."
1,BOOORRRRRING!,This was the slowest book I have read in over two years. Every mystery writer I have ever read is better than this one. False advertising on this book. Plot is pathetic. Please don't waste your time or money on this one.
2,"good concept, too much filler","also too many characters fitted to cliche. Wife: super beautiful, talented, smart, uber feminine. Daughter: (also) super beautiful, talented, smart, sporty (although mother would have preferred ballet, the daughter does soccer). Detective: gruff, hard bitten, not terribly smart, pushy. Secretary: plain, subservient, adoring her boss... and on and on... AND we do NOT, do NOT need another hooker with a heart of gold, no please don't... oops! too late he already did it.The story's concept is really very, very good but with much too much filler. Plus we don't even get a glimpse of the plot until we are well into the book. We do not need every single detail of every single thought the main character entertains. Keep the story moving!One star for writing. One star for the concept."
3,Intriguing Approach,"A London psychiatrist finds himself suspected of multi murders after the police ask him identify a body in the morgue and he knows the woman. Robothem keeps the reader twisting and turning throughout the story.Stricken with Parkinson disease, suspected of murder, caught in the act of infidelity, internally combating issues with his father and his expectations: how much more can the main character endure... an intriguing approach to a psychological thriller. A very fast moving read."
3,My order of the Excerise Ball from Bodytrends,"I ordered a 55cm anti-burst blue excerise ball with dual action pump so anyways it was not what I expected to get at all it was to small and the plug was broken when I recived it, I left a negative review and then Body trends called me the next day telling me that if I removed my Negative feed back they would send me a new correct size ball at no cost and free shipping I removed my feedback and Im still waiting to recive my new ball, But If they actully do send me the correct ball Id say they have out standing service A+ ! If I dont recive it then lets just say I'll keep you updated! Thanks Redckittie@mail.com"
4,acceptable,This ball does its job. The only complaint I have is that you have to keep adding air. It doesn't stay tight. I use it daily so maybe it is normal wear and tear for these balls. It has stood up to my three-year old son who gives it a run for its money. That says a lot for me. I would say this is a good value for both ball and pump. I have even used my pump for other things. The plastic tip screws on and off and you can put on other valves.
2,Goes for camp but gets lost on the way,"This sequel should have stuck with its predecessor's or comic book ""roots"" (me am funny). The light-hearted, comic romance just doesn't suit the character. Occassionaly, the two kids bring a laugh but that's all you'll get from this two-fisted, monster fest. Skip it and buy the first one."
4,"Beautiful watch, but HUGE! Small wrists must resize.","I bought these with a gift card from my brother-in-law to wear to work because I thought it looked like a gorgeous watch and Pulsar has a good reputation. When the watch arrived, I was very impressed with how beautiful it was. However, I was unable to wear the watch because it was HUGE on me. It slid half-way to my elbow. In order to wear it, I had to take it to a jeweler to have it resized. I don't believe that I have overly small wrists, and I know I don't have small arms! This watch band is very large and since it is a linked band, you have no choice but to take it to a jeweler. It's worth it, though, because it is a lovely watch, especially for the price."
1,Junk,"This generator is the worst I have ever had the displeasure to operate. Took at least 20 pulls to get it started and then cross your fingers and hope it stays running. After only 3 uses the PLASTIC recoil mechanism of the recoil starter broke. After countless hours of web searching found no available parts or even a website or contact info. Recommend that you stay away from this one and that Amazon discontinues selling this junk. Could not post this review without adding at least ""1"" star, so please ignore it !"
3,Wobbly :<,"Fassbaender has got so much vibrato to her voice that it really put me off. There are times her wobbling isn't centered, and it just feels awful."
3,Pretty good imagination,"This isn't too bad for a 1st time author and his first work. He definetely has quite this imagination. This is worth a read. I read it twice. I bought it at a local bookstore where he did a signing. Not bad at all. Otis is a real interesting half dwarfen ""bastard"""
5,"Great for rabbits, too!","I bought this tunnel for my rabbits and it is easily their favorite thing in the world (aside from treats, food and hay!) They love to hide in it, they love to make the bell jingle, and they even toss it around the room! I highly recommend this tunnel for anyone with curious, playful small animals!"
4,Best Comeadian!,This is one of the best comeadians i have come across. anything she's in is great to me.
2,Okey Dokey types,"She is not that funny as Russell Peters not that i am critisizing anyone but i did not find her that funny.. I will rate her as a TWO STARRegards,Salome Ferrao."
5,Funny!,"Kathy Griffin is a favorite, and her special keeps you laughing. If you like talking about famous people, she is the gal for you."
3,From Rossiya with Love,"Another adventure with the Newbys find Eric and Wanda hurtling through Brezhnev's Russia on the famous Trans-Siberian railway. From collective farms to asylums, the Newby's take you along with them on their tour.Part endurance challenge, part history lesson the book does suffer in part by capturing Russia at its worst: food shortages, restricted travel, stern officials and windows that won't open! But the Newby's accept it all with relatively good humour and like all their adventures, they manage to find lots of interesting characters along the route. I've always been able to think of lots of reasons NOT to visit Siberia, the trans-siberian train ride might have just given me one!"
2,Gets a little interesting toward the end,"The first half of this movie, Ed Burns' character, has everyone asking him if his brother is alive, who was supposed to have been dead for 3 years, and he denies this. The second half everyone finds out his brother is alive and the mob is after him for killing 3 of their mob members.If you can get past the first half of the movie (had to skip a chapter or 2), it gets a little more interesting. All in all it moves at a snail's pace."
4,"""Ash Wednesday"" by Edward Burns","Perhaps my opinion is biased because I am a huge Edward Burns fan but I truely enjoyed ""Ash Wednesday"". It's dark and haunting quality makes it very different from Burns earlier works. The music is great and the cast is phenomenal. I would have liked to see a more intimate relationship between Francis and little Sean and I am suprised that he neglected to address this since it could have been pivotal to the storyline. As screenwriter, director and the star of the film, it is his call as to which direction he takes with his characters. A good example of this is Claudia in ""No Looking Back"" and Francis in ""Ash Wednesday"" but it would be interesting to hear his take on where he chooses his characters to go, both emotionally and physically. ""Ash Wednesday"" will not leave you with that ""happily ever after"" feeling but I give it 4 stars and will be proud to add it to my growing collection of Edward Burn's work."
1,F this F that,"If you love the F word, you may like this movie, but if you are like me and cringe, and think that kind of trash talk belongs in a trailer park. This is the first time i am throwing away a move after watching it one time. It was just CONSTANT F words to no end. Add to that a beginning that leave you confused as to what is going on and who are the names (in between the F words) they are. Could have been a very good movie."
1,Polaroid Film,Make sure you know the expiration date all of the film I bought was expired. Only one add stated it in the sale. I bought 3 packs for over $100 none of it worked. Buyer beware
2,Contrived to Confuse,"Elizabeth George lets her own agenda get in the way of telling an intriguing tale with this effort. Too many subplots to advance the backstories of each of her stock characters, and too much manipulation of the reader by jumping back and forth in time so that significant clues are not revealed too early, result in a book not up to her previous standards. Moreover, her depiction of English cultural idiosyncracies is beginning to be formulaic rather than charming."
2,Disjointed,"A fan of many of Elizabeth George's books, this one was disappointing and scattered. The time shifts were confusing; and at the end little was resolved including the motive for the other killings. The theory proposed is weak and not easily believed. There are much better E.G. books to read."
3,A New Direction,"Traitor to Memory is easily the most challenging read of Ms. George's recent work. Her traditional narrative is accompanied by the parallel narrative of one of the main character's diary. As usual, she doesn't succomb to the desire for an easy answer, but ending is rather bleak, and ultimately not terribly satisfying as a mystery. Still, the author again rises above the genre in her characters, and makes this a worthwhile read for her fans. It's definitely not for the first-time reader of Ms. George's work, though."
1,was the editor missing too?,"I waited 2 years for the next book in the Havers/Lynley series and what do I get? Simply an overlong, awful boring, simplistic book without the characters that made Elizabeth George's books so fun to read. The interaction between Barbara and Lynley is usually priceless. Lynley's feelings of guilty re. St. James are getting a little dated at this point. The story of Gidon was, well, boring. It went on way too long. Libby, Gideon's sort of weird American girlfriend and the ending were overdown. It was just not interesting. It was easily figured out early on. And EG seemed to incorporate story lines that went no where. What was the point? I wanted to put this one down several times, but did not due to the fact I kept hoping it would get interesting. It does not. I had no issue with Winston getting more play, but the core of her stories - Barbara and Lynley - are what keep readers coming back for more. This really was the story of Gideon, not a Havers/Lynley mystery."
5,A captivating book,I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I didn't mind the length because it gave George the space to let us get into the heads of several of the characters. I felt like she was showing the reader a side of each of her characters that would make him or her possibly the murderer. Each of the characters became a better and better candidate for murderer as their personality developed.I liked the entertwining of the lives of the characters. This murder was definitely caused by the event that took place 20 years before and the changes that we see in the main characters in the first murder are credible.I found the ending to be perfect. It showed the reader the heart of the murderer and was consistent with the personality developed throughout the book and yet the way it ended was a big surprise. From a psychological viewpoint it came full circle.
3,A Traitor to Readers,"I've read several of Ms. George's novels and marvel at her skill with the English language, her knowledge of a broad spectrum of British society, and her defense of right vs. wrong. This book, however, left me screaming at the end. How could you??? I was depressed and angry for several days after finishing the story. It took so long to get to the end, and just when things were going to end in a positive, redeeming way, George pulls the rug out and destroys it all. What a bummer!! To make it worse, it's the American, Libby, who turns out to be the ogre! This will do nothing to improve Anglo-American relations!"
2,A Traitor to Memory,"I've reached the last few pages of this tome, and I'm not sure that I have the interest or energy to carry on. This one has exhausted me! I have always enjoyed reading and rereading Elizabeth George's novels, and I waited anxiously for ""A Traitor to Memory"" to be published. I have been both bored and disappointed by this novel. I wanted to know how she had advanced the lives of the characters that people her stories: Havers, Lynley, Helen, St. James, Deborah, and Winston. Each is intriguing in his or her own way. However, they and the unfolding of their lives were obscured by the narcissistic demands of the central character, violinist Gideon Davies, his Victorian father, his maniac grandfather, and the hollow women who took to the shadows in the madhouse of Gideon's childhood. I look forward to Ms. George's next book. In the meantime, I think I'll spend my Christmas holidays enjoying her earlier works again."
2,Ho Hum,"I have been a fan of Elizabeth George from the beginning but I'm never buying another of her books until she gets a new editor. This book could have used some pruning. Come on, Liz! We all care about what happens to Lyndley and the lot, but could you get us there a little more efficiently?"
2,"back to havers, lynley and the crew","I had a feeling from the beginning how this book was going to end. There were few twists and turns in an exceedingly long novel. Can we go back to basics? Mysteries with the detectives we know and love uncovering the truth as the main storyline. Did not like this book and gave it a two only because one is reserved for those I put down and do not finish. And the only reason I finished it was to assure myself that I did indeed have it figured out right from the start. If you are big fan of Elizabeth George and feel you must read this book, be forewarned, this is not the usual Lynley/Havers storyline. I wish it were!"
2,Agree with negative reviews...,"I agree with pretty much everything others have said. I am beginning to really become involved with our main characters, and this book barely featured them and lost my interest at page 100.It has all been said: the book is too long, the ending is head-scratching and disjointed, and where are our Lynley and Havers shining through?I don't usually like to skip books in a series, but recommend skipping this one."
3,Mixed up Memory,"I have to agree with some of the other readers, that this story was way too long. I think it could have been wrapped up quicker. Things got pretty messy towards the end and the ending was most unsatisfactory and left a lot of things unanswered. I can't believe any author could have something like this in their mind as it was mind boggling to say the least. I would have liked to know what happened with the P-man that had such a big part in the whole thing, and Raphael and Katje. Maybe George will pick up some of the pieces in the next book as she had wrapped up some of lives from another earlier book in this book. I guess I'll have to wait and see."
1,REVIEWS TELL A TALE !,"At last count, 67 reviews of ""Traitor"" were negative, 48 were positive and 38 'waffled' -- so WHY were 2 positive reviews designated as ""SPOTLIGHT""? Someone can't figure the math!You wouldn't be reading this if you were not a fan of the Lynley-Havers-Nkata line-up of homicide detectives. They have long been fictional favorites so why drown them in an encyclopedia-length saga peopled with unappealing bit players? Their secrets, possibly rising from some dark celllar of the author's past, are played out in excruciating tedium.Inevitably there will be inferior manuscripts published because the authors are ""established"" (aka ""income-producers""), or they are celebrities. BUT that doesn't mean the books must be purchased -- or read."
3,Not that excellent.,This is my first George novel and I'm not impressed and it was a bit gloomy than I expected.
1,A looonnnng slog - for not much,"Verbose, too many sub-plots, annoying, snivelling characters...So much potential wasted on a tale that didn't seem to have a center holding it together. Disappointing, to say the least. Don't waste your time on this one."
3,Elizabeth George is usually a good read,"Elizabeth George is usually a good read, this one is partially an exception. Be ready to slog through even when it gets a little too verbose--and not the least bit interesting. Quite a bit of the book could have gone a little faster or been edited down. Gideon, while interesting, isn't so interesting as to be worth the majority of the book--in fact he only becomes interesting in the last few pages. All in all, the book is worth it if you have a long flight or car trip. It is not the one to choose if you are new to Elizabeth George, nor if you are expecting George's usual level of writing."
2,She hit a strike this time out,"I'm usually astonished by the quality of Elizabeth George's novels, particularly given their length and complexity. With ""A Traitor to Memory"", though, she went too far. About a third of the way into this mammoth tome it seemed like she was treading water -- the same characters were acting out the same scenes, again and again. Usually George juggles all her characters expertly, carefully revealing their secrets and connections to keep the reader hooked. This time they all seemed to spin about at random, with readability further complicated by the flashbacks and the different points of view. I applaud George for attempting something this complex, but next time keep the poor reader in mind! On the plus side, there are some fascinating, expertly drawn characters, but it's all too much. Where was the editor on this one?"
2,You can do better,"I truly enjoy reading Ms. George's books, but definitely not this one. The constant flipping between Gideon and his analysis and Lynley/Havens was very annoying. I had to make myself read the book and it was a chore. I agree with others, ending weak. It won't stop me from buying her next book unless she uses same format."
3,Traitor to Memory tested my memory!,"I have read several books by the author and have particularly enjoyed the Lynley/Havers team, but this book really tried my patience. Too long, too many characters and plots going on. I actually thought about tossing it when I finally finished it, but as a book lover, I couldn't do it."
2,An EG fan but more editing please,"Although EG is one of my favorite writers this book was a big disappointment. Lynley/Havers are two of the most credible characters in mystery and for that reason the rather small and supportive roles that they had in this story was one of its biggest drawbacks - any avid EG fan would have expected the unexpected but sad to say that the culprit with means, motive and opportunity were obvious in the first third of the book. The biggest disappointment was the ending. However, I look forward to the further development of Lynley/Havers characters in the next EG book."
3,"A little disappointing, but overall-good","I am a true fan of Elizabeth George and i have read all of her books so far. This one was pretty good, but please be aware that it is not a quick read, it will take a dedication of one's time. It was interesting the way the plot kept twisting and i liked the use of the diary to reveal further information to us, however, i was disappointed with two aspects of the book: 1) I have grown to love the characters of Lynley and Helen, Simon and Deborah and Barbara, and almost nothing in their personal lives was advanced, with exception of Lynley. What about Barbara and how she is dealing with her family? Her attraction to her next door neighbor and his daughter? 2) I was very disappointed in the ending of the book. I did not expect ""happily ever after"" but surely this was too depressing! I do encourage E.George fans to read the book, just so they can have their own opinion and be sure to share it with us."
2,"Frustrating set-up, terrible customer service, not mac-friendly","Perhaps I would have had a different experience on a PC, but for the Mac, it's hard even to locate the set-up instructions on the CD. Those instructions are difficult to read and leave out key steps. The customer ""service"" is that awful, irrelevant and out-sourced. Even though I've set up this router at two other offices before, I have spent hours going in circles this time. I will have to remember to research the quality of support before purchasing electronic devices in the future."
3,"When it works, it is good. But you have to reboot it every couple of weeks.","This product is fair good when it works. But it becomes unresponsive in every couple of weeks, all the lights are on but it does not response to anything and connection is dead. The only way to fix it is to unplug and replug the power. I had this product for a year now and I reboot it every couple of weeks. I suspect this is caused by a memory leak in the firmware, but a firmware upgrade did not fix it. Somebody on the Internet said this is a known issue by Netgear, but they have not fixed it."
2,Poor Quality Hardware,"I own the MR814v2 802.11b router. That is a very stable product, so I figured since I had a WG311 wireless card in my desktop I'd buy another Netgear router for 802.11g. Many of the reviews here were favorable, so I bought on the basis of that.This product is simply not stable, at least for me. It has to be rebooted constantly. For sure it cannot hold a wireless connection more than 24 hours. I upgraded to the latest firmware, which at the time of writing is 4.1.11. No help whatsoever. I checked on-line, and sure enough many many people have reported similar problems with it (broadbandreports.com). I tried disabling the 108Mb features, but that also didn't help.So in the end, I'm just returning it after a frustrating weekend."
2,Works Once in a while,When this unit works it works well. The problem is it constantly needs to be unplugged and plugged in as it drops the internet connection about twice a day. I have version 3 and the latest firmware.I can't believe Netgear hasn't fixed this problem yet or has taken this defective product off the market. Maybe there needs to be a class action law suit to wake them up?Not happy with this product at all and will not buy Netgear products again.
1,Avoid this Product,"I bought this Netgear router bundled with a USB adaptor at Costco. It was very easy to set up and worked great for about 15 minutes. Then both my desktop and laptop lost connection to the internet. FYI, I have an Dell XPS laptop and a Dell Dimension desktop running Windows XP, with a Motorola Surfboard modem and Adelphia internet. I can stay connected about 10 minutes at a time, then I lose my connection and have to reboot my computer. What a pain! This is going back to the store tomorrow.I suggest that if you are looking for a reliable router, that you avoid this."
5,This rocks,"This router is all that Netgear says that it is. I have wireless access throughout my home which is modest at 1100 square feet. I also have wireless access in my back yard, my front yard. I can be on my neighbor's front yard and have wireless access. I purchased this because my old Netgear router wouldn't cover the entire house. I have mostly Windows XP on the network but this router also works fine with two Fedora Linux boxes that are connected wirelessly to the network."
1,Skip It,"After several days of intense side by side testing, under a variety of situations I can say, without a doubt, this router is slower than the Linksys BEFW1154 v4 model I was going to replace it with. What stunned me was download tests and page loads across a WIRED ethernet connection. Netgear WGT624 V3 was consistently 50% slower loading pages after doing 40+ measurements on both routers. I can't wait to return it."
5,Color of WGT624 is GRAY - NOT BLUE like in pic,"I experience the well-documented occasional random resets but I don't do mission critical stuff over the network, so it's not really a big issue. Wireless connection is problem-free as well.BTW, I have no idea where amazon.com got the photo of the WGT624 but the unit is NOT blue - it comes in two-tone gray."
4,Netgear and Vista don't mix well,The Netgear router hooked up to our main PC (XP operating system) works awesome! Our internet is so fast. But when I set up the Netgear adapter to our other PC (Vista operating system) I've had so many problems.
2,Good Price but Questionable Reliability,"I purchased this product from Radio Shack for my girlfriend who has used it for about a year. For a long time we thought the interwebs losing connectivity was an issue with Comcast but recently it has become clear that its an issue with this router, dropping the connection randomly."
1,Netgear WGT624v3,"Spent few days and tried all the solutions that I can find online, just can't get this to work. My old MR814v2 is fine and the setup is way easier than this one. Lucky enough, I recommended theBelkin ME1004-R Wireless Cable/DSL Router 802.11gto all my friends during the past year, so far no complaints."
1,If you like frequent router reboots & dropped connections...,"then this router is for you. Google it and you will find multiple forums with ample posts about this router and its problems--wish I 'd read them before I bought it. In spite of numerous attempts to configure it per instructions and updating the firmware (which the almost unintelligible Indian tech support urge you not to do after waiting on hold for 20 minutes), still problems. It seems to drop connections most during online gaming.My opinion is, keep looking for a router and do a forum search before you buy"
1,Netgear router review,"Be warned. I have had many problems with this router. Until recently they were nothing major, just annoyances, but recently Netgear's latest ""firmware"" update caused it to stop working all together (don't believe me? it's happended to many others ... check their user forum!). Netgear (offshore) technical support has been giving me the run around. First I can return it for replacement, but then no, I cannot. The jury is still out on whether they will or not. So, no more Netgear products for me!"
1,trash,This router is garbage! I can't download anything without getting every computer on the network booted offline. I have all ports forwarded correctly... not like it should boot you even without any ports forwarded. When this happens you have to go all the way to the router and unplug it. This is unbelievable! I've been trying to fix this for DAYS! Doing a million searches on google trying different things people have suggested. Not one of those suggestions has helped me. Updating the firmware did absolutely nothing. I know this has nothing to do with my modem. When a computer is connected directly it will be fine. Once its connected to the router you cant download a thing. About the only thing i can do is surf and IM. Do yourself a favor and buy something else.
4,"Great IP connection, but!","I bought this router the day before I received my new Gateway NX570X laptop. It installed beautifully within 30 minutes and both my desktop and laptop connected to the internet. Beautiful, but I have still not been able to share any resources between the two PC's. Any comments/suggestions most welcomed![edit] Less than 30 minutes after posting this I found out that my S/W firewall was the culprit. I turned it off on both PC's and I guess I have to increase my 4-star rating to 5-stars. Strange that Gateway techs couldn't find this problem."
1,Crappy Product,I purchased this router in February and in May it died. Stay away from Netgear router.
1,"Works for awhile, then crashes","I unfortunately have to give this a single star for effort, its stylish look, and its low cost. The unit worked fine for about two days, then the wireless network started to intermittently disconnect. Now, on its fourth day, its firmware was upgraded in hopes of alleviating the intermittent problems, and it now entirely refused to work and continues blinking the Test light.I should have researched this product before purchasing it; a quick check on Netgear's forums reveals that this product has a whole host of problems (such as overheating and, again, sporadic shutdowns that require rebooting).The installation disc also requires Windows and Internet Explorer, which I wish was clearly stated on the box. I have no idea why it needs Windows since other routers (such as D-Link's) simply requires any web browser."
4,"i'm a beginner for networking, and I barely had problems","We just got a DSL connection going from bellsouth, and my parents wanted to network thruout the house, so they asked me to research routers. I read CNET and amazon reviews and ultimately that this is the most simplest, most secure, basic, long range router for us. When we got it, setup was a breeze (without encryption of course). I had to get on the phone with Netgear (now I am hearing indian accents everywhere), and finally after 3 hours, we activated encryption. Then there were issues with the configuration, and IP address, etc. But ultimately after about 3 weeks, everything evened out and now there are no problems. Range is excellent, even poolside. the design is so smooth and aesthetic. Gave it 4 stars mainly because of support, and security."
1,WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!,"They just say that is my internet provider problem when clearly it is not. Impossible to tell NETGEAR supporters that it isn't because they are INCOMPETENT in computers and can barely speak any English. It's like trying to get a monkey to help you with computer issues. When the 90 days ran out, then they said I had to pay for the PRIMIUM support service. MAYBE NOW I COULD GET 2 MONKEYS TO HELP ME AT ABOUT $50 PER 10 MINUTES. NEVER BUYING ANYTHING FROM THEM AGAIN!!!WORD OF ADVICE: If you buy NETGEAR and need support, you're on your own!!! Their Support is run by monkeys."
1,Unreliable product - Horrible Customer Service,"I purchased the original router in December 2007. Since that time the router has been replaced by Netgear 3 times as it was defective and has stopped working again. The first time it stopped working, I spent several hours on the phone with a tech support rep that I could barely understand before he would agree that the unit was defective. The second and third times it stopped working, I needed to correspond with tech support via email unless I wanted to pay a $75 fee because the unit was over 90 days. Both times it took 6 weeks of emails back and forth before they would agree that the unit was defective. In each instance I needed to ship the router back at my cost before they would consider shipping out the replacement. Four defective routers in less than 18 months is crazy, not to mention I've had about 5 months of lost usuage during that time. I would never buy a Netgear product again."
1,Support Limited and Doesnt work for me,I have had a problem with this for over a year (owned it a year in Jan)> It worked for a few days and hasnt ever since. I have spent wasted time with tech support from both netgear and verizon. Last night verizon tech called netgear and was told from India that support was not available without payment or going online...HAHAHA>>>CANT go online with it.Going to get a different one come Monday from verizon.
1,Absolutely horrible!!!,"Although this was supposed to be a veritable piece of cake to install, all it did was continually crash my cable modem and/or my computer. It reset so often that I couldn't perform the setup functions or register the product at all--the whole process was completely frustrating. A call to the help center did absolutely no good, as I waited for 20 minutes on hold just to have them tell me that because it wasn't registered I couldn't receive any support from them. AVOID AT ALL COSTS!"
1,Bad Router,"I bought this based on the technical specs. Big mistake. From the minute I installed it I've had problems w/ random reboots. I've spoken to Netgear tech support 5 times - finally, they just told me to send it back. As others have said - that is a lame excuse. Google this product and you'll see - the reboot problem is a very pervasive problem among many purchasers. Luckily Amazon has great cust. svc and return policy. But they are shouldering Netgear's problem."
4,"Great range, cumbersome firmware update","Over the last couple of years I have set up over 50 wireless networks, using most major brands. Just for reference, my favorite router is the Dell 2300, which not only offers good reliability but also great range and the best customization features on any residential router so far. I set up this router with FW3.02 in parallel to a Dell, expecting it to offer lower signal levels, but I was plesantly surprised that it in fact offered 2-5dB higher levels at most locations and actually gave me great range. Set up was straight forward, firmware upgrade with serial number is cumbersome. Configuration options are good, but no access point mode (can usually be faked by diabling dhcp and using lan1 input) and no bridge mode(like Dell), are a set-back, in particular since Netgear advertizes this as a ""commercial grade"" product.Pros:-range-easy basic set-upCons:-cumbersome FW upgrade-less customization options than some others"
3,Fun except....,"The Sims Livin Large is fun except... Every time I start a new family everything's fine until they have a job. After they get a job and they look in the newspaper and see a better job, he/she is always too depressed to start it and quit the worser job! And they keep peeing on the floor even when I put in a toilet! They'll sleep on the floor even when they have a bed. And they are always yelling at you. But I do think it's fun to control the Sims.It's an Okay game,but it's not one that I play often."
3,Time to have a bigger family,"Install this expansion pack and you'll see that you can add more family members in your house. You'll see new furnitures, wallpapers, and appliances. This will enhance your gameplay from the initial The Sims. :-)This expansion pack may not be as worthy as it says. Not many new items are added. It would be better if you pick another expansion pack for The Sims. Refer to my other reviews on other expansion packs for more details. However, if you are a The Sims addict, you may want this to complete your collection."
2,Too Addicting,Beware everyone this game is extremely addicting at one point in my life it was taking up almost all of my leisure time. I would have gave it one star because of its extreme ability to make people lose their lives over this game but its such a fun game I had to give it 2.
5,Buy this game at your own risk!!,"WARNING!!! Don't buy this game unless you want to be on the computer all the time. This game is great, a lot better then the first Sims game. All of my friends want to borrow it, lately I've had to hide it from them. This expansion has a few more items such as a robot that cleans up like a maid, a bed that lets your sims ""Play In Bed"", and one of my favorites is a rocket launcher. There are quite a bit more objects, walls, floors, ect., then the first. And yesterday I figured out how to get unlimited neighborhoods. I also just bought The Sims House Party, and I can't wait to get The Sims Hot Date where your sims can go on a date and end up with a goodnight kiss...or more. ...."
3,"it's ok, well...","After getting The Sims, I guess I had higher expectations for Livin' Large. The Opening Wav. File left much to be desired, the roaches are out of control (I'm not sure if the patch they give you helped), and most themed wallpaper and windows were very specific (like the medieval theme). One of the pluses, though, were the new professions and the new objects (ah, the vibrating bed). But if you were just looking for more window designs and wallpaper, the simple stuff, just download them online."
5,A great expansion pack....,"This is the first expansion pack of The Sims, and it's very good. This is a humor pack with main highlights of.....Love Bed=Sex Chem. Set=Good Mood, love, Freistein! Ele. guitar=cool sound, cool music, with love, future, mad sciencest, and church style, you almost can't lose! I like future style because there is a robot that does everything for you! Cooks, Mech., Garnener, and Maid! He is really cool. With 125 objects, some more skins, 2 doors that open auto. , make anyone love you with love potion, better stove and reg. , and more neighborhood's makes Livin' Large (Livin' it up) Great, it's worth the 30 dollers. Graphics, same as The Sims with all the opoints like The Sims:10/10 Fun, it is very fun with expansion pack:9.5/10 Gameplay, it's even longer with more neighorhoods! :9/10 Sound is the same as The Sims:9/10 and overall, it's great with Livin' Large, my rating is:9.5/10 which is awesome/perfect, and 5 stars goes to the cool Livin' Large!"
5,A poet's impression of quantum mechanics,"At long last I had the opportunity to reread this book that had entertained me many years ago. I cannot help but notice the odd parallels between the strange ideas presented in the novel and the whacky world of sub-atomic physics in which much sense of reality goes contrary to one's impressions of the ""ordinary"" world. Essential reading for physicists, artists, and anyone who just wants a good read. I harbor the fond hope that Spike Jonze (Being John Malkovich) will make the movie!"
3,Must require a special taste,"The first hour is a psycho-drama that reads like a re-working of The Turn of the Screw, although not as engaging.The next hour or so is a picaresque tale that is occasionally very funny and mainly aimless, so much so that I have quit on it at least for now.The reader is exemplary; my guess is that I would have liked reading the hard copy much less."
3,man and bicycle--forever joined,"this book was very well written. it was bizarre and funny. maybe too much so in parts. to say it is about bicycles is much too limiting. so, what is it about? um, it is the story of one man's life following his murdering a man for a box of money and his subsequent journey--mostly descent--to recover that box after he hides it with his accomplice. he travels to a police station where he meets some strange officers, who tell him about omnium, which is, in short, everything, and show him the way to eternity, which is just down the road. a philosopher named de selby also figures into the book as many of his theories and the critiques of those theories by other philosophers are discussed. yeah, so it's a good little book. it's very interesting. ok, i'll end it here. i don't want you to sit in that chair too long. afterall, we don't want that chair being more human than you."
2,I give it 2 stars because it's different...,"Tech N9ne hates the mainstream, but he sure goes out of his way to be a part of it. He's nothing spectacular, his beats are typical hip-hop junk, and his lyrics are dumb. Why would he brag about first having sex at the age of five? Maybe to a complete loser, that's respectable, but not to anyone with any type of basic human decency. This is ordinary, unimaginative rap, and while he goes fast sometimes, he basically sounds like Mystikal with a hint of harmony. Nothing evil about this."
4,a classic,"this cd was already a classic when it was first released, but w/ addition to these 3 new tight ... cuts it makes the album even better, it's just too bad I already had the original anghellic, so i pretty much paid 15 bucks for 3 songs, but since tech n9ne is hands down the best lyricist ever it was worth it...."
2,Clumsy product,"I've tried these 3M Command Hooks and don't like them. I'm not exactly sure why I don't like them, but I don't like how they work. Applying them is clumsy, and removing them is less than smooth. They don't work well, and the process is not satisfying."
4,"Great For Seasonal Art Work, Dog Leashes, Light Coats","As described, these hooks are easy to install and remove. We used them in a kid's room for scarves and sweaters. They easily support light weight coats as well. These are perfect for kids' rooms, because as kids grow you can easily remove the hooks without damaging the walls. Change the adhesive and place at the new height! No nail holes! Also great for Christmas wreathes and decorations on interior doors and walls. When the holidays' are over, simply pull down on the tab and remove."
3,Not Enough Weight Held,"I like the idea of these hooks being removable without damaging a wall, but I did not realize how low the weight they can hold would be - only 2-3 pounds."
4,Incredibly useful. But...,"The ability to stick a ""hanger"" on almost any surface, then remove it without damaging the surface, makes 3M's command-adhesive hooks one of those rare inventions that meet a real need. However...The hooks seem designed for large objects that are deep enough that the hooks' thickness doesn't keep the object from lying more or less flush with the wall. (Picture frames are an obvious example.)Objects with flat backs don't work as well. Hanging an LCD clock (by its ""keyhole"" opening) leaves the clock tilting forward, and wobbly.Part of the problem is that the hook itself is too wide at the bottom, and one has sometimes to carve away part of it to get a snug fit in the mounting hole.I wish 3M would do something about this."
4,"Used for a rental home, will now use in our own home.","We had to live in a rental temporarily and hated to put up more nails than I had to. So, I have used these on painted walls, painted wood, your basic laminated-type fiberboard cabinets and doors, wood cabinets, and glass...and all worked well except the glass, which left a bit of sticky residue. Otherwise they went up easily, stayed stuck, and came off easily after months of use.When removing these, I had one or two tab pieces snap off (see uploaded photo) but there was usually still enough to grab to pull it off the wall. I also learned that you really need to keep a hand on the piece that's stuck to the wall as you're stretching the adhesive, otherwise you'll get cracked in the knuckles when it suddenly pops off the wall.The biggest challenge is remembering where you put the extra sticky tabs so you can reuse the hooks after you take them down...but that's not the fault of the hanger. :)"
3,Surprising how well these hooks work,"I was skeptical about using these hooks, but my wife saw them on Amazon Vine, and had me order them. She just had the shower stall retiled, wanted to install hooks, but wouldn't drill any holes in the tiles. What impressed me is that the hooks actually worked as advertised. I didn't test anything heavy on the hooks, but it worked great for something light, like the shower brush. I also liked being able to remove them without leaving any marks on the tile.I liked this product, and will buy them next time I need something like this."
5,I love these!,"OK...so these hooks are the answer to all of my problems. They hold things very well and they do not damage my walls. What more can I ask for. Just a tip.... I used several of these last year to hold up my christmas lights on my house. I didn't think they would work but sure enough they did. I hate the clips that go under the roof shingles. I just don't like having to lift up the shingles in order to get the clip secured underneath the shingle. So, instead of using the clip, I put several of these hooks along my gutters and strung my lights up. It worked great! I will never use the roof clips again. I love these universal hooks. They can hold about anything and they don't cause any damage! If you haven't tried these yet you don't know what you are missing. : )"
5,works on brick walls,"I have always had trouble hanging anything on the walls because because they are brick. I tried this with my hats and they work great. I am still not sure about anything heavier. In the past, I would have trouble with hooks falling off as the brick seems to collect moisture, but this hasn't happened so i am pleased"
5,Good versatile hooks,"These 3M Command Adhesive Hooks are the answer to when you need a semi-permanent place to hang something. I put them in the laundry room to hold shopping bags and pet brushes. They hold well on the wall, provided you prep the wall first. Removal is easy enough and doesn't leave any marks or tear the paint. I have several of the metal 3M Command Adhesive hooks that I used on the backs of bedroom doors to hang clothes on. Great product!"
5,I may not be a general but I play one on...,"This is one of the most realistic tactical simulation games I have played. At the harder levels working at normal time this game is very hard to beat. Living in Maryland I have walked the battlefields of Antietam and Gettysburg. I now have a better understanding of both battles having ""fought"" them first hand.Good stuff: Very fun similar to the Close Combat series. Great learning tool to understand battles. Challenging on a grand scale. The full battle includes directing more than a hundred units.Bad stuff: The interface can be fidgety to operate--especially when there is a breakthough and you need to move fast. I have had the game lock up and lose information (rarely).Overall I found this was a great tactical game. It features a good mix of hands on action and a good game AI."
1,Horrible Game - Stick with Age of Empires!,"This game stinks. It reaks. My dog looked at me while I was playing it, and he was like, ""Hey, why are you wasting your time with that garbage? Play Age, and wait for a decent Civil War RTS."" Then he laid a big dog log on the floor to show what he thought of the game. YUCK!!"
4,A must read for parents of teenaged daughters,"Saving Beauty from the Beast should be required reading for parents of daughters. Co-authored by two mothers who lost their daughters to abusive men, this book provides a great balance of real stories and factual information to help parents recognize when their daughters are in unhealthy and potentially dangerous relationships. It also includes helpful information for parents of boys who are showing signs of controlling and abusive behavior. A fast-paced, engaging, and sometimes horrifying read. Highly recommended."
5,A Gem More Valuable Than Your Engagement Ring,"This is a gem of a book that helps you navigate financial discussions in a compassionate yet business-like manner. Arlene Dubin informs her readers WHY issues are important and shows them HOW to initiate discussions based upon common values and shared goals. After a couple finds they are on the same page, the dollars involved and technical know-how can be inserted into the dialogue.I have practised as a Certified Financial Planner for 18 years, and send this book to clients and allied professionals. It is eminently readable, but does not dumb-down a subject that is important to anyone contemplating marriage."
3,A little lightweight,"So much of the book is spent trying to convince the reader that it is OK to write up a prenup, that there is little left over for the nuts and bolts of how to do it. For those of us who have already decided to have a prenup, this doesn't serve our needs. I suppose it might be helpful for those readers who haven't decided to draw up a prenup."
5,"""And the hits just keep on coming!""","As promised, Edwin McCain has delivered one hell of a CD. As a devout listener to Edwin's music, this is by far the best release to date. Far From Over has a great blend of slow and fast-paced songs, and should offer every listener a variety of songs to sing along with."
5,It truly IS Far From Over!,"This cd is titled so appropriately! It is a mix of old and new sounds for Edwin and the band and it's PHENOMENAL! Letter To My Mother is a touching song about adoption, it is even more moving to see it performed live and to know that it comes straight from Edwin's heart. Get Out of This Town ROCKS...it's so unlike the ""usual"" music you hear from this band....my own Mother even LOVED it!Stop by ClevelandParkonline if you'd like to learn more about this amazing group!"
2,Sadly disappointing,"As a longtime fan of Edwin McCain, I couldn't wait to buy this CD. Unfortunately, it was painful to listen to. This sounds nothing like the Edwin McCain I know and love. It's full of songs about drug addiction, hitting bottom, and has a real grunge feel to it. I regret buying it."
2,REALLY LAME FILM!!!,"SHOULD HAVE BEEN A VERY GOOD AND ENJOYABLE FILM(NOT A BAD STORY),BUT UNFORTUNATELY THE TIMING(OR SOSMETHING???)OF THE FILM IS JUST ""WAY"" OFF.I LIKE GOOD FAITH BASED FILMS,BUT THIS FILM IS TOTALY LAME AND VERY HARD TO SIT THROUGH.I AM VERY FORGIVING,WHEN IT TO COMES TO LOW BUDGET FILMS,AND OWN MANY LOW BUDGET CHRISTIAN FILMS THAT ARE 5-10 TIMES BETTER THAN THIS ONE."
1,"fragile, handle with care","this carafe is so prone to breaking even without dropping. the plastic top breaks easily and when i cleaned the carafe with a dish brush, it cracked and a big hole was left in the glass. it is now in the garbage. a total waste of money."
5,We need more like this today,"As I was born in 1955, I loved this movie. It made me remember our countries strong points are in each other. His life is an insperation to us all to be ourselves. Being 1/6 native american, I realy saw his point on some things.This movie is one of the best about a life and times I have seen, with the exception of Mark Twain. Our country needs more movies like this today. back to what we are and what makes us strong."
4,Exellent game,"This game have very good graphic's, very good sound but the only thing that I dont't like is that the gameplay is a little bit stupid but is fun"
5,It left me speechless!,"This is a extremely moving film. In the beginning you are trully oblivious to the limits this film goes to to capture your undivided attention. This was one of the best movies i have ever seen and by far the most memorable. If your looking for a film to envelope you, move your heart and expand the limits of your mind then this movie is a must. You cannot come away from it not thinking about the power of the human mind."
2,Clumsy Portrayal of Borderline Personality Disorder,"It's an interesting and extremely twisted plot.On the other hand, if you are interested in Borderline Personality Disorder, which is what the female lead supposedly suffers from, this movie is terribly confusing and misleading. You can't cure borderline disorder by srewing the brains out of your patient (or even your wife). You can't understand much of anything about the disorder by watching the movie either. The worst thing that the movie does is provide false hope for an easy fix. The most optimistic therapists for borderline disorder state that it takes 3-7 years of dedicated therapy for someone suffering from the disorder to make a significant recovery.The one thing that is relatively realistic is the confused reaction of the husband, who really can't figure out which way is up to save his life."
2,OTT,Weak on verismilitude and ignores some critical boundary issues that would in reality lead to a therapist losing his license. Some of the acting is so OTT (Over the Top) that it is hilarious. Nice architecture.
4,Really good results,I am so happy I tried thiso product. It totally made a big difference in the apearance of cellulite on my stomach and thighs. It looks way smoother than before I started using Lipo-Sculpt Gel.
2,So-so product,"I've been using Lipo sculpt twice a day for about 6 weeks now and I've noticed a little slimming, but absolutely no results as far as cellulite reduction is concerned. I will be going back to my old trusty Oligo DX for that... I thought I would try this since it got rave reviews, but it just was not at all what I was hoping for."
2,Tedious,"I was very disapointed to find that the most interesting thing about this book is the title. Overall, this book felt very repetitive and tedious. I thought it was an interesting take on the subject of how violence arose but there was too little evidence to support the thesis so the various examples given seemed to be used over and over. I also felt that the author used many biblical passages out of context in order to support her argument. Overall, this was a very speculative study that could have been shortened by 200 pages. If you do buy this, read the first chapter and the last couple pages."
1,a total waste of money,if u want the bmw angel eye look go with something better & brighter this only show up in the night not in the day like the bmw angel eyes do this thing is just a plastic ring with a led on either end of it if your cheap buy this if u like something good spend your money & dont make a mistake that me & some of my friends made buying this
2,Very little applicable to new construction.,This did not suit me. I was looking for information on insulating and weatherizing new construction and this book dealt primarily with retrofit.
3,Cowboy Boots,"I had to return them to the seller. They run very wide. Quality was good, but even with thick socks, they were definitely not a B width as I expected. I also had hoped that the toes would be a little more pointed than they were. They were more round-toed than I cared for. Vendor was really good about sending me a return shipping label though. I would order these as long as you know they run wide, and that they are not pointy-toed."
3,not as nice as the picture,"this feeder isnt nearly as impressive in person. the parts that look like shiny silver are actually gray dull rubber. the top piece almost looks like a jewel in the pic but it is a rough gray metal tab. its super tiny too. one of my suction cuips had a npiece missing from the bottom but it still worked. also the way its designed, it has to be completely full for the birds to be able to reach the nectar. havent seen a single hummingbird so far."
2,Tea Time,I missed something when ordering this one. I didn't realize it was TINY! I was quite disappointed when it arrived.
2,Paying more for less,"I was excited when I received my Kindle; getting the Boston Globe digitally couldn't get any better. Unfortunately, this format cost more money and I feel as though I got less. This is especially true about the Sports section. There are no standings or box score information."
4,Very good,"It's good enough that I was able to cancel my physical subscription. Yes, it IS missing some content, but most of what I actually read in the paper is included in the Kindle version. Navigating is a little weird at first, but once you figure it out, it's quite easy. Overall this is very good, and at the price it was definitely worth it to me. I suspect that this type of delivery method is the future of newspapers within the next 5 to 10 years."
3,Disappointed,If you buy the globe paper edition you get the online globe free. I like the KF edition of the globe but would like access to the online version of the Globe too. I called the Globe and they said they would if Amazon only would inform them of who their subscribers were. Come on Amazon let them know so I can get my free online access. Sometimes I want to forward articles to other people and other times I would like to copy or comment on articles which I cannot do with the KF edition. Hope you read this
2,priced out,no longer worth the price increase. a 50 percent increase to get sports stats. i dont think so
2,Needs lots of work,"This product can really use an overhaul. I use it about 300 days per year and it continues to amaze me that they can't seem to fix some basic stuff. Subscriptions are $14.95/mo or you can buy the daily for $.49 cents - why would anyone buy the subscription? If they charge 11.(( or 12>99 for the subscription, they would have a lot more subscribers. The columns are in no particular order so I'm jumping from baseball to football and back to baseball again then high school sports, then the Celtics and back to the red sox again. Charts and graphs are horrendous and usually unusable.Amazon can also fix a little basic stuff too... everyday I have to go to Newsstand, then type the whole word ""Boston Globe"" to get a chance to buy it. You would think there would be a way to save that or that the Fire would remember it."
2,BYE BYE GLOBE... HELLO NYTIMES.,"The Boston Globe has over priced this horrible electronic edition. You will find typos and the the same article twice with different titles. The Boston Globe customer service department didn't even know that they pushed a kindle edition. Sometimes the paper comes late or it doesn't come at all because it wasn't delivered right. You were able to read it on your iPhone before and you can't even do that know they only send it to one of your devices not all of them, and that one device has to be a Kindle. The price of the subscription is ridiculous, $14.99 and you get no weather, no stock updates, and not even an 18th of the pictures in the paper edition. I'm telling all of my friends with kindles (quite a few) not to get the globe! I'm getting the NYTimes or the washington post. I really wish you could buy just one issue at a time rather than subscribing!!! There also needs to be a sunday edition only!!"
3,Fun for the first five minutes,"Bought this for my six month old, she really does not care for it at all. My five year old autistic son did enjoy it for about five minutes and set it aside. It has been collecting dust since.It is just another toy where you press a button and get a short song and light show, nothing more."
3,Grandson Loved It!,"I purchased the Kaleidoscope for my 6 month old grandson. He loves the music and lights. The handles are a little large for him to hold right now, but soon they will be perfect. A great toy for babies who love music."
5,SUPERBIKE 2001 WOW!!!!,"Of course, it's the high-powered motorcycles that are the stars of SBK Superbike racing, and Superbike 2001 will feature seven recognizable factory rides, one of which is brand new to the series. You'll be able to select any of the following bikes and a respective rider from the outset of the game you won't have to finish the game to complete any other feats to ""unlock"" any of them. Here are the bikes: Ducati 996 RS 2000, Honda VTR 1000 SP-W,Kawasaki ZX-7RR,Suzuki GSX-R 750,Yamaha YZF-R7,Aprilia RSV 1000, and the Bimota SB8R which makes it debut in Superbike 2001.The core of Superbike 2001 lies in its single-player campaign mode, which simulates an actual 13-event SBK Superbike season. SBK 2001 easily surpasses the level of quality set by its excellent predecessor. Graphics and sound are excellent! All I can say is GREAT!!!"
5,Absolutely the best Roadracing Sim out there!!!,"I owned Superbike 2000 for 2 years I had to buy another controller due to the buttons malfunctioning??? I picked up SBK 2001 this past Saturday.... Let me tell you EA knows all the tricks that make a simulation game come to life! Set your self in the cockpit of a VTR 1000 and fly down Hockenheims 200 mph straight, then brake at the 100 yard mark and make a daredevil dive through the chicane.. You actually feel like your on the motorcycle. The graphics are just unimaginable, and the sounds are different for each bike. Here something that everyone dreams, I play this game on a 1000mhz machine, 64mb GeForce2 vid card, and supply all that with 256mb Ram.... OH YEA this game looks like HD TV and couldn't get any better! A MUST BUY!!!"
5,NHL 2001 scores big time!,"The new NHL game from EA is a welcome improvement over last year's title, including sharper graphics, updated rosters and teams, and better gameplay. Online gaming is also available which can be accessed straight from NHL 2001's simple to use interface. The only thing really wrong with the title is that the color commentary quickly get's repetitive and tiresome, but fourtunately you have the option of turning it off and just enjoying the game.Whether you're a seasoned verteran or just starting to play for the first time, NHL 2001 will suit you good."
5,Best Hockey Game Ever,This is the best hockey game ever to hit the stores. U have a bunch of new features like create a jersey and change team features. One is u can change their name and what city and state they play in. Theres even to new International teams Ukraine and Latvia. So i hope this review made u want to buy the best game ever. NHL 2001!
5,Nutcracker DVD,BOUGHT THIS FOR OUR GRANDDAUGHTER AS A GIFT WHO DANCES WITH THE SAN DIEGO SCHOOL OF BALLET. SHE LOVES IT AND WILL WATCH IT OVER AND OVER FOR MANY YEARS. IT WAS PERFECT. DEFINITELY RECOMMEND
1,Did not live up to the hype,This movie was flat and had been done before in any number of mediums. Its poor production values and superficalness made it the kind of film that was far too easy to just turn off and not bother coming back.The conflict between the daughter and her family was interesting but the rest of the movie was so predictable and so riddled with archetypal characters that it was ultimately an unfulfilling watch.
4,Mirrormask,"The disk played just fine, however I had been nervous about the multiple scratches on the back. Overall, a good purchase."
3,Visually beautiful and twisted,"MirrorMask is a visual feast. A young girl, Helena, dreams of a real life as she has to work in her parents' circus. After a big fight with her mother, her mother falls ill and Helena feels guilty. Helena dreams she is in a weird place where the balance between light and dark is failing and Helena must find the charm to return the kingdoms to balance.Her adventures allow us to see the beauty and the strangeness of the kingdoms: floating giants, flying monkey things, darkness bombs, wondering towers, libraries and books that fly home, and then friendsip, loyalty, trust, love. It's not clear what's happening at time but when it clicks it works. Helena finally tricks a sphinx in a way no other fantasy every has. It's filled with lots of little thing.It's definitely worth watching if you like your films a bit off-kilter and visually as well as emotionally entertaining."
2,Bad Movie,"The story is about a girl named Helena whose father runs a circus but she is unhappy and wants to run away. She gets in to fight with her mother who is rush to the hospital after wards (for reason that are never explained, and believe me there going to be a lot of unexplained stuff in this film) Helena goes into shock and one night why she is asleep she drifts off in to a weird fantasy world that seems to be made from her weird art. Here she meets a mask man named Valentine and to gather they go on a quest to find the Mirror Mask. The world it self is really cool looking but the story dose not make any scenes. Its mainly just weird images after weird images witch after while gets vary boring. I also got the Impression that this movie was made for girls but the movie really has no point to it at all. You will forget all these Characters the next day (Besides what they look like) and feel great when it's finally over.Avoid at all cost!"
2,"visually amazing, lacking everywhere else","i too waited a couple of years to see this film arrive in the USA, and wanted to love this film so very much. i've always loved Dave and Niel's work in the past, and i expected this to be no less wonderful. sadly, i left feeling empty. while the efforts and the visuals were worth a rental, the storyline took Mirrormask to the edge of what could have been a hugely successful masterpiece and dumbed it down. it is too scary and dark for young kids, too wierd for tweens, too childish for adults. with more defined dialog and a coherant plot, the film could have been a classic for all ages. this just seems like a spoiled rotten little kid dressed up for the fancy ball with no one to take them there. i for one, am greatly disapointed."
4,Fantastical,"This was the most unusual movie I've seen in a long time! Jim Henson's creativity with new, never before seen creatures is great. A nice addition to my DVD collection."
2,What a waste of time,"Boring. Stupid. Confusing. I give it points for some great special effects... but it still didn't work for me. Maybe if I had read the story it was based on it would have been better. Unless you like artsy films... go watch something else, Potter, Narnia, the new Wonka... a bunch of bad 80's music videos even. You really don't need to watch this. Go outside instead."
2,Looks Good....But Really Isnt,"In a few words, I wasn't really crazy about it. I remember seeing the book for it in a bookstore some time ago and thinking that this movie was going to be dark and really cool and it was dark indeed, but sadly the plot was very boring. the cg environments were very cool to look at but the characters were not. Movies like the dark crystal, never ending story and labrynth are comparable to this in genre and all had a plot, a mood and an objective storyline. This was just random eye candy. I'm giving this one 2 stars, because it looks really nice and the cinematography was well done. Visually, the movie is nice to look at and the soundtrack is decent also, but the anticlimatic plot and storyline are rather disappointing."
4,"Odd, but beautiful","I loved this movie the first time I saw it. The imagery was completely amazing, and I just had to have the dvd. The beauty of this is just magically stunning, and will have you spellbound. However, to those who are allergic to the odd-be warned. Some of my friends have described this as an acid-trippy movie, not that I can confirm that. The plot and characters are downright confusing, but the scenes' and the settings' wonderful eye-candy more than make up for the confusion. The main idea at least is conveyed, although more through sound and sight than through words and explanations."
1,Waste of time,"I tried and tried to become interested in this book and finally gave up completely at about the 3/4 mark. The editing was terrible, with many wrong words and misspellings. I have to say the editing was on a par with the story itself. Not good. I think this writer was trying for a Brigette Jones' Diary take-off, but it falls totally flat. Don't waste your money or time on it."
5,Solid and Loaded,"This multi-tool has everything that any rider could want to make quick repairs up on the hills. Compared to the 19 function tool, there is absoluteley no difference. The chain breaker tool works perfectly for a sram PC-971 chain and pushes the pin out with ease and a good turn and a half left over. Comes with a nice ruberband to keep the chain tool in place and fits easily in my camelbak rogue with plenty of room for many other things. My biking budy uses the same tool but his has taken abuse for 10 or so years now. Crankbrothers all the way! Overall, this tool is bulletproof and I wouldn't have choosen anything else."
3,Crack Brothers Multi Bicycle Fool (17-Function),"I wear tight fitting spandex when I ride so I don't have any pockets to put this Multi Bicycle Tool which includes 171 Tools, so I just put it in between my legs, it bulks me up and makes everyone stare at me more but I don't mind.I've never actually used the Multi Bicycle Tool because it's pretty much worthless, since everything is so small or awkward to hold or tighten with it. I just think it's cool to have it when riding, although it does crunch me up if you know what I mean.Also, it does not have a hammer, which comes in handy when beating your headset or pedals.No flashlight either so useless at night."
5,Great Tool,The multi tool 17 is the better of the multi tools. I use it at home and if needed on the road. I just can't say enough good things about this tool. I would not ride very far without it. Get a folding plier and a short lenght of wire and you are ready for almost anyghing.
1,Disappointed,Would have liked the set a lot better if they hadn't put two 5mm allens in it. Not very good for adjusting my seat without the 4 mm allen.
3,Voltron Masterpiece edition,"The Voltron Masterpiece edition is big and heavy, Which is a good thing but what isnt a good thing is the plastic legs on the die cast bodies. The one I got is pretty loose too when they are in lion form, however when transformed into Voltron it is pretty poseable and stiff. However i digress, It is a really cool toy for any collection or just to play with. Enjoy!!!"
4,WOW!!!,I had the original matchbox lion voltron and in comparison to that this is not as durable yet more agile as far as posability goes. The look is closer to the television version of lion voltron than that of the matchbox styling.
2,Reminiscient of the 80's,"This game stinks...The graphics are terrible, choppy and simple, even when they are all actived. The play selection is weak. I had a very hard time adjusting my controler settings to be compatible with Madden's configs. It looks and plays like it any Madden from the Sega Genesis days or Super NES, only with bigger, choppier graphics. Don't buy it. I'm telling you you will regret it."
4,"Good, but needed a touch more polishing","madden 2001 is a good game, with wonderful graphics and sound. my big gripe is the menus are VERY confusing. I even had to go to the help screens to find out how to move around to move onto the next page! besides that and the bland commentary, this game on the field is a jewel. great graphics, terrifc sounde effects, and internet play. this may not be the best football game so far, but it is way better than anything else on the pc shelves at the moment. if you like football, buy this game. the menus are frustrating for awhile, but the game itself is worth it!"
2,Ghetto and pointless but funny,"The only reason I bought this DVD was because I used to model with the main actress, Chanya Middleton. Other than that, this movie was not something I would invest in. It looked low budget, the plot was stupid, the cinematography was horrible, and the acting sucked. On the upside, it DID have some funny parts! I did laugh a few times during the movie, the jokes were stereotypical but still funny.GO CHANYA!!!"
2,Endangered by Magic,"Two worlds collide in this third Magic book. In one world, two hapless fey are forced to work with a demon lord to save one's fiance'. The price of salvation is to destroy the world. However, Largo and Allegro may find help in preventing this devastation from two humans. Nolan Monroe is on a path of self destruction to atone for the death the woman he loves by his own hand, or so he believes. Tess Ballard would be only too happy to make sure he pays, until she gets to know him and finds herself falling for a possible killer. Both dilemas may be solved by finding the demon lord's enemy's heir and thus saving both sets of lovers, England, and Europe from eternal darkness and thus will love save the day.** The two stories come off as being artificially meshed and have a bit of a disjointed feel. Seperately, they might have worked, but combined, they fail to make music. **Reviewed by Amanda Killgore, Freelance Reviewer."
3,hsu Ginseng tea,It taste really good. I am not sure what it does. It sounded good so I bought it. I bought more. It may be good for energy and may be sex drive. Who knows LOL it claims that it is good antioxidant but I have no way to determine that. It is just a gamble. I figure I drink all kind of stuff so this won't hurt.
5,Great Bible!,"I bought this for my husband and he really enjoyed it. He is getting along so much better and enjoying that extra time with our daughter. What a great book! Thank you, Jesus!"
5,Essential Death In June compilation,"This is a compilation of a personal choice, tracks picked up by DIJ mastermind Douglas P from the years 83-98. Lots of remixes and other unreleased material is featured on this compilation. Still there are no new songs, just new versions of old songs. Great compilation introducing many sounds DIJ has had over the years. Even thought this is not a ""best of"", all the songs you'd expect are there. This is the one DIJ album to start with."
5,Great Baby Visuals. Everything our kids love!,"Our three children absolutely love ""ABCs & 123s"". We have been very selective about our children's TV viewing and found LittleFriendsTV to be among the quality DVDs like Baby Einstein. I think it's our families new favorite! Kate, San Rafael, CA Mother of 3"
5,bright and durable,This was slightly brighter than other 21 led lamps and the metal construction seems very sturdy. I do not like the end off/on switch. I would much rather have a side button.
2,"less performance, costs more than 9 LED version","I bought this light and the 9 LED version at the same time. I have used both side by side.The 9 LED version is $4.99. The 21 LED version is $9.99.Both I and my father in law vastly prefer the 9 LED version. They use the same power (3 AAAs). A brief lesson about electronics: If you take a power source, and hook 9 LEDs up to it, and then you take the same power source and hook up 21 LEDs, the 9 LEDs will be brighter. The power gets ""watered down"" between the 21 LEDs. While there might be technically the same amount of light, it is far less concentrated on the 21 LED light and each LED is dimmer.Anyway, I won't return it, and the unit works fine. The 9 LED version is much more powerful and costs half the price, so buy two 9 LED units and put one in the drawer until you need it.I have since bought 3 more 9 LED units. They are the better option."
1,Worst flashlight I ever bought,"Bought several of these flashlights and one was defective out of the box (the inner LEDs would not light up). Seller did replace it, but after 2 years they have all been thrown away. Some of the LEDs would not always light up and they would kill the batteries in a relatively short time. Some of these were kept in our cars, but were dead when we went to use them (luckily we never had an emergency). I checked the batteries and one actually had a negative charge??? Just an awful product."
2,Poor connection,"Bought several of these only to find that sometimes, it would turn on and sometimes it wouldn't. Finally figured out that it was due to poor connection of the battery holder so I had to break off a tiny plastic piece in order to get the metal at the bottom of the holder to stick out more. Now it works great! But I give it 2 stars for having made that poor connection in the first place. It has taken me a few years before I learned I could mess around with the battery connection. Almost threw it away."
1,Cheaply made?,"The light worked fine the first couple times I used it. Very bright and a very nice blue color. Even came with a little carrying pouch which I thought was very nice. But the button that you push to turn the light on kept caving in. I don't have huge hands, very dainty actually, so I think it was just cheaply made :-/ I sent it back for a refund, never again.Sorry!"
5,Hide your's,"I ordered three of these units, an I am very happy with them, finding that the battery life is great.The amount of lights they produce is amazing.After the first few hours, one walked to my son's car, and then anotherto my wife's car.I keep mine locked in my glove compartment, after being questioned about it's where abouts ( many times )They make great inspection lights, fit in a small jacket pocket."
2,Do flutes sound like this?,"Sounds Horrible, like some cheap plastic toy you'd give to your children. Great for decoration, but dont expect to get any music out of it. Good Luck."
3,Fun Jean Reno Action Film,"Jean Reno plays an overly brutal French cop, who at one time was with French Intelligence in Japan. He fell in love with a Japanese girl, but she broke it off. He returns to France and becomes a cop. 17 years later he receives word that she has died and left him a box. He travels to Japan to pay his respects and retrieve the box. And that is when the plot begins. I won't give away the surprises, but it's a fun action film. Only 3 stars because of some bad casting and cartoon characters."
3,A little imperfect in his moral conclusions about Saddam,"I""m not sure why the book's author feels that stopping Saddam Hussein back in 2003 was anything less than a good thing. The former Iraqi leader got a million Iraqis and Iranians killed in the war between the two nations from 1980 to 1988, Saddam killed thousands of ethnic Kurds in Iraq and robbed those Kurds he didn't kill of almost any rights, caused 25% of Iraqi kids to starve (a Unicef report made in 2002 showed this), took over the nation Kuwait to pay off war debts, afer being expelled from there in the deadly Desert Storm he tried to take over again in 94, etc. What did the guy have to do before we decided he had to be taken out of power---destroy half of Japan? Tragert you should know better than almost anyone else that Saddam was worse for his own Iraqi than the coalition has ever been."
2,"Perhaps ""Go for Dummies"" would be a better title.","After reading Kageyama's ""Fundamentals..."" I was a little disappointed with this series. I read volumes II and III and was surprised at how little substance there was: big pictures, big text, and lots of distracting doodles. Volume III talks about 7 deadly sins of go, yet I couldn't find them. Most of the book was devoted to reviewing a few games that took place between high-level players. Although this series might be great for the extreme novice, I'm disappointed that they stretched this material out into so many volumes."
2,Disappointing...,"I will post this to the first four books of the series, which I bought all at once.I was hoping this series, as popular as it seems to be, would be the Go equivalent of Yasser Seirawan's ""Play Winning Chess,"" but this series has nothing in comparison. I agree with other reviews that describe the books' lack of depth. There is actually so little information presented in the first four volumes, that they might as well be combined into one book for the same price as one of the books. There are also glaring typographical errors throughout every copy.Don't let the glossy covers fool you, in my opinion, this book series is nothing but a money grab. (Half of this book is analysis of arbitrarily chosen games, a great way to fill up pages! a lousy way to teach a beginner how to play Go)"
2,Treocasered1,"Loved the case, especially with the clip ... the clip broke first time I clipped it on!"
4,Simple yet fun.,"I actually bought this because my grandma is a card shark and I thought she would have fun sharpening her skills. I played it with her a bit. But, the next time i went over there she had a ridiculous score... we went to the casino later. She won us money. lol."
4,cool game,"I bought this game for my grandmother who is 83. It's big enough for her to see on the tv screen and she loves texas hold em. It's an added bonus that it has 14 other games. The system is super easy to set up, just plug it into the tv. The remote is wireless which makes it so much easier to use, no wires getting in the way. The graphics are simple, nothing spectacular, but def worth the money for a simple game that's entertaining."
3,Does what it says.,Works exactly like advertised. Graphics a bit rough but the controllers are pretty cool.
5,One of the all-time top 40,"This novel was voted one of the 40 all-time greatest horror books, along with ""Dracula"", ""Frankenstein"", and all the classics ... and it's easy to see why. ""Dracula"" was a novel which, a century ago, skirted the very edge of sexual taboo ... now that the boundary line has moved, here is a novel which goes right up to the edge of today's sexual taboos in the sexless yet luridly erotic character of Timmy Valentine, a 2000-year old vampire who looks like a 12-year-old rock star. This is considered the first ""splatterpunk"" novel by many critics. It is the first novel to mix vampires and rock music (Anne Rice's version came out a year later). It holds up very well after 21 years."
4,"This book was extremely amazing, deep, and dark.",Timmy life got to me. Everything that he went through I was able to imagine to the fulless. The darkness of the book is what appealed to me the most. These elements of his dark past are nerve racking. If you can take the grism that Somtow presents this book is not for you.
4,Does the job,"I ordered this HRM because it's designed for women and I didn't want something bulky on my wrist. Like all the HRMs I've seen, the band is plastic, which I really don't like because of the sweating I'm already doing when I'm working out. The monitor part that goes around the chest is a rubbery material with an elastic strap, not the most comfortable thing, either. It took me awhile to get the settings right and the directions weren't all that clear, but once I got through that part the product works just fine. It's good to see that my guesstimates of exertion and so on were pretty much on target, and of course it's nice to get that immediate feedback that I'm in the ""zone.""For the money this HRM is fine. Nothing fancy, just functional."
4,Sadly out of print !,"I recall, perhaps I was in college, WHEN THINGS OF THE SPIRIT COME FIRST came out in paperback. I'm afraid I've lost track of my copy over the years. It's an early work of De Beauvoir's, three closely interlocked, charming short stories. I found it hard to put down."
1,"Looks better than the first 2, but beware of all the cheats","Delta Force 1 was a great game, but there were so many cheaters that it couldn't be played online unless you didn't mind invisible players who couldn't be killed knifing you.Delta Force 2 was just as bad for cheating and it runs horibly on any machine due to it's graphics engine.Delta Force 3 fixes all the graphics engine issues, but Novalogic has not, in the last ten years, addressed the fact that cheaters have ruined the last two games.Any other game, the developers follow it up and issue patches to stop cheats. Not Novalogic. If you want to know just how bad they treat their customers, just write them an email saying you own one of thier products and that you aren't happy with it for some reason. *IF* they respond, it will be rude."
3,Great book and music - Should be labeled Intermediate,This should be considered an intermediate book. This would be pretty far advanced for any beginner. There is no oral instruction at all. Getting into Bluegrass Mandolin from Mel Bay is a much better book for beginners and intermediate players.
3,Tool For Preachers,"This is not a book for light Saturday-night reading, nor is it a book that most Christians would appreciate. But. . . for the pastor or preacher that is wanting to discover a method for communicating God's timeless truths and making them relevant and applicable in today's society - this book is worth the effort. I found that I had to re-read some sections and work at it so as not to fall back into old habits. I would suggest trying to read it while on a vacation, holiday or sabbatical and then taking some time to try and implement the methods described. The author shows how to tie togther the people, problems and God's actions in the Bible to the people, problems and our expected actions and God's continuing actions today."
1,deserves no stars,"Reading some of these other reviews, I cannot for the life of me figure out why so many people like this movie. It is wretched. It was recommended to me by the clerk at my local video store, who promised me it had ""the best transformation effects ever!"" She was so wrong, I wish there was a way I could successfully sue her to get my two bucks back. I think she meant to say ""worst"" f/x ever. And the rest of the movie follows suit. Half the ""plot"" of the movie only exists to present one nudity-laden scene after another. This is insulting. And I'm male! I like seeing beautiful women naked! But I also like movies to have at least SOME substance to them. I could go on listing reasons why this movie reeks to high heaven, but if you're reading this, chances are you're considering watching it no matter what I say. So go ahead. But you have been warned. Why do so many people like this bomb? And where are their doctors? I just don't get it..."
2,A REAL HOWLER,"Ryan Alioso, Samaire Armstrong and Tippi Hedren are the only reason I gave this ridiculously lurid and gory movie two stars. The three actors defy all logic by being so good with given so little. As for the dancing babes on the rooftop, why is it that lesbianism is now such a dominant element in so many horror movies. It served no purpose in the film and the switch backs with this ridiculous scene and the murder of one of their friends was so long, I felt like I was in prison with an incommutable sentence. Face it, people. ..."
5,My Cat likes to toss and chew these,"I buy these for my Siamese cat. For some reason, he will spend alot of time tossing it up in the air, throwing it around the room, stalking it, pouncing on it, chewing it, and carrying it around. It's his favorite toy and usually lasts about a month. Funniest thing I have ever seen. My three other cats just stare at him and wonder what he is doing."
2,fit too small,"I have what i consider a small dog, but this is for like a toy size. The strap was way too tight. I really don't see how this could fit on any dog without chocking them."
4,Nifty Strap Pad - Makes all the difference,"An absolute must-have for your Timbuk2 Messenger esp if you tend to carry heavy items like a laptop (Macbooks are NOT light). It makes commuting much more tolerable and pain-free on the shoulders. The problem is that it sometimes makes it difficult for me to slide my bag from my back to the front and vice versa, though this is easily solved by loosening the strap pad itself."
4,Good shoulder relief,My wife has been complaining about her purses digging into her shoulder. I found this pad on amazon and showed it to her.She couldnt tell if it would work but we decided to order it anyway. The pad fit great on one bag but not the other. This was no problem because I also ordered the Domke 725-310 FA-031 post office shoulder bag and that one fit on her other purse. She is now happy with both bags.
3,"Well-padded, hardly grippy","The strap pad fits well as a replacement for the stock pad and looks good. The padding is ample, but there really is no tack to the rubber surface. Maybe that's something that will improve over time?"
2,Not as pictured - Mediocre comfort,"1. The swirl on the strap is yellow, not white. Considering ordered this online specifically for the white coloring to match the white swirl on my bag, this is a problem.2. The additional comfort provided is mediocre3. There should have been a padded strap on the bag in the first place. I wish I would not have wasted another $10 to give Timbuk2 on something that should have been included with original purchase."
4,"The Rev. Jean-Jacques D'Aoust, Ph.D. recommends","Dr.Timothy Johnson is both a doctor in medicine and a graduate of theological education. Consequently, he is well qualified to raise serious scientific questions that the average college educated person might raise and respond to them out of both his personal scientific experience and critical biblical understanding. Since I have read innumerable books on the relations between science and religion, some of which are very sophisticated and out of reach to the average adult, I found Tim Johnson easy to read, while he maintains a scientific integrity,"
5,captivating,"Instructive and funny! Not only did this carefully researched book provide valuable gems of insight on how infrastructure can be used to foster industrial development within industries and across firms, it was thoroughly and unexpectedly entertaining! (The anecdotes were particularly captivating!) A model of solid empirical research and a must read!"
5,Great for that guy who needs some help,"Let's just say that the title has proven quite true!If you are the typical guy who works, comes home tired, kicks back in front of the tube or the computer, then around bedtime starts to ""notice"" your wife, this book is for you!"
3,Sheet music is way better,This was a waste of money. nothing compared to Sheet Music by the same author.Heather
3,"Relevant and intelligent read. Slightly boring. Scripturally sound information, but he doesn't give the Bible credit.","Relevant and intelligent read. Slightly boring. Scripturally sound information, but he doesn't give the Bible credit.. . . . ."
5,awesome book,This really helps you understand the importance of loving and how love is a CHOICE and how you were drawn to that person in the first place cause sometime we forget.lol. I think everyone who's in a relationship should read this book.
1,This didn't work for me,"Worked great for a couple of days, then my Windows Vista PC and my networked Mac OX X laptop could no longer see my HP LaserJet 4L printer. When you'd replug it, it would make that ""found hardware"" noise and then immediately make the ""disconnect"" noise. Pretty cheap-feeling cable, which is to be expected for the price. I ended up returning it and buying the Tripp Lite one available on Amazon, which was more expensive but actually works (so far)."
2,Doesn't work with Vista,"I just can't get this cable to work with Vista. It gives instructions, which after about a dozen tries I got to work (after accessing the advanced boot menu for Vista), but then after re-booting, Vista wouldn't recognize it. The problem is that Vista requires ""signed"" drivers (Microsoft approved) - you have to disable this feature everytime you boot up. Apparently earlier versions of Vista would allow you to disable this feature (not for the novice), but my later version wouldn't allow that on a permanent basis.In the 5 mintues it worked, it seemed great."
5,A Gamer in USA,"American McGee's Alice In Wonderland suprised me. When I first noticed that the game was out I was like yeah right,but I bought it and I loved it. Basicly you play Alice and Wonderland does not look like it used to. It is deformed and evil. She carries around a Knife along with many other toys (that you get latter in the game), as the Mad Hatter calls them, and she kills the evil monsters around her. The Graphics in this game are unbelievable. In the game there are many different levels and most of the characters from the movie (The Queen, The Cat, The Catipiller ex.) are in the game along with some added ones. The sky is a swirling black pit and the cat has no skin. The game is pretty advanced, not extermely hard but it has its times. If you like Alice In Wonderland or you thought the movie was to fruity then this is the game for you. Its an awsomely wicked game that everyone should try. Highly Reccomended."
3,A Good Effort,"This game is graphically stunning, the story is very interesting, and the sound is exellent, but this game has one huge flaw that I can't look beyond ther is no joystick support. Playing games while hunting down the right keys on a keyboard removes me from the gaming experience. Any action based game should have joystick support, thats why a home console system comes with a gamepad, not a keyboard. If this game had support for a joystick I would definately play it more, but untill EA creates a patch or upgrade it will probably just sit on my desk."
4,"Good game overall, but....","Overall I really enjoyed the game. The 2 downsides I saw were as follows: Not much replay value Not long enoughOn the upside, it was a very well done game, and it's nice to see a different type of Alice (namely the pyscokiller type Alice). Most gamers overall should like this game, but it does get dull at some points, and really frustrating at others."
4,Only $9.99 now on PSN and XBLA or Free with Alice Madness Returns!,"I hate extortion, and $149.99 is just that. Not only does this game come free with Alice Madness Returns, if you just want to play it, its available on the Playstation Store and Xbox Live Arcade for $9.99. Currently there is a sale on Alice Madness Returns for $39 here on Amazon, $29 for PC. So yeah, I know its not right, but a great game should be allowed to be played without burning through your savings."
4,American McGee's Alice Review,"I have never layed an ""M"" game before, and when I first played this game, I never wanted to stop it was so much fun! American McGee's Alice is a brand new story of ""Alice In Wonderland"". When Alice was a little girl, her house cought fire and she was put in a mental hospital so she wouldn't kill herself. (Because her parents died in the fire.) She somehow falls through a wormhole into Wonderland. She is greeted by the white rabbit, who has changed alot, along with the chesher cat. Somthing has gone terribaly wrong. Somehow, Wonderland has become all evel. It is up to Alice (you) to journey through the lands and defeat the red queen. This game is rated ""M"" for mature users. This game is a violent thriller and has you leaning on the edge of your chair. I highly recomend this game!"
5,Still a great game,This is a really fun game that puts Alice in a whole new light. It is pretty hard and the story line is great so you can play for a long time and really enjoy it.
1,HORRIBLE,"I guess the lowest rating you can give a movie is one star...otherwise I would have given this movie zero stars. It was TOTALLY unentertaining, not funny at all. DO NOT BUY THIS, and don't waste 3 dollars renting it. And don't waste the hour wathcing it either. Time would be better spent building a fort out of lima beans."
1,NOT good.,"I really didn't like this movie. The reason I rented it was because it had a familiar cast and the plot seemed followable. But it really wasn't very good. I think you'd have to have some huge thing in common with the characters to like it. Also, I expected there to be some bad words since it is rated R, but come on, 101 times is just too much. You can make a point another way. Don't rent this."
1,Horrible,"This movie is terrible. The script is bad, and the acting is even worse. There are virtually no laughs the entire movie, the characters are boring and uninteresting."
3,How 'bout some additional O/S support?,"I purchased this title with the intent of running it on my Win2k Pro PC, but it ended up not being compatible. I know the system requirements only list 95/98/ME, but games with those specs usually end up working on NT based systems as well. I ended up installing it on my ME system instead. It's odd because that PC is a blazing P3 1Ghz with 256M of RAM and all other hardware exceedingly surpasses the requirements but it still ran rather sluggish. Not only that but it seemed to lock up at regular intervals--even with the software patches available at EA's site. If I were you, I'd wait until next year's version, which is bound to have even more courses, fewer loading problems and (fingers crossed) multiple O/S support."
2,tiger woods pga tour 2001,"I find this game very difficult, and also very slow. The courses are very good but the overall game not so good compared to other golf games which are also a lot cheaper."
4,Good playing - poor material,"The trouble with having a jukebox hit is that your record company expect you to come up with another hit every album.""Blues Walk"" had given Donaldson a wider audience, and this was another attempt to record that elusive hit.""Gravy Train"" appearing here in two versions, was meant to fit the bill, and it's the strongest of the tracks from the set. ""The Glory of love"" (also here in two versions) is passable,but whoever chose the rest of the tracks relied too heavily on old and not very imaginative standards. The band does its best to redress the balance. It's a good Donaldson performance, and Herman Foster lends good piano support to the horn player. There's neat drum work from Dave Bailey ( former Mulligan sidesman) though the appearance of Alec Dorsey on congas seems like an attempt to beef up the weak material.There are other Donaldson performances that you ought to buy ahead of this - perhaps starting with that album ""Blues Walk"""
4,Needs improvement,LP Philippines contains very informative data for travellers. But what it lacks poorly in is the author's opinion for the places which would help the traveller in deciding how to map out the itinerary.
3,Interesting record from days bygone,"Everything in this book has been used and abused over and over again by marketeers.Maybe in it's time it was indeed pioneering work - now it is just a curiousity. Things have moved on, although human nature hasn't changed one bit."
3,"Potential apparent, yet flawed","This game has great potential. Beyond great. Excellent. There are only a few basic things I have to say: 1) There are too many bugs. Wait until December or so, maybe they will all be fixed. 2) This game is a hardware buster. 3) The gameplay is flawed. It gets frantic, the villagers are ANNOYING, and impossible to take care of efficiently. This game is downright impossible to concentrate on the missions sometimes because you are too busy controlling the villagers. End of review."
2,Read the James Perkins Review,"For adults, the James Perkins review of Black and White nails this game. Read it, then skip purchasing this game. I was very excited about getting it after reading/believing the hype. The creature and its ""leashes"" drove me insane, and detracted from the small amount of entertainment I had begun having from solving the puzzles in the game. Maneuvering is (IMHO) counter-intuitive, especially which way the POV revolves based on the sliding of the mouse. And the forced tutorial is mind-numbing. The only worse ""forced"" passage in a game is the part of NOLF where you have to ask the fat industrialist all of those inane questions."
1,Osiris may be wrong on this one....,"I read Osiris' review about needing the 90MB patch, that is incorrect. That is a patch for the non-English game if people still want to here and see English language. Being from Canada, I guess he would need that. Sorry Osiris, but game companies expect that if you live in Canada and buy the game there, you will PROBABLY speak the local language, not the game's natural English. I admit that that is a huge patch, especially if you own a modem, but at least it was made available to you. I have yet to play the game, which is why I didn't rate it high. However, I ordered it a few days ago, and should get to play it around January. I will write another review about it then. I am fairly sure I will give it a high rating then."
1,black an...d.......zzzzzzz.zzzzzzzzzz.....zzzzzzzz,"this is one of the most overrated piles of tripe ive ever playedthe graphics are pretty but you'll need a pretty hefty card and processor to get the most out of them. my voodoo3 450mhz struggled almost constantlythe gamneplay, although hyped up something massive is dull at best. it just boils down to the people want wood so put some trees in the store. the people want food so put some food in the store. the other god wants you to get more land, put food and wood in another village's store. etc...sound is good but it doesnt reallt matter considering the rest of the game is so dullthe creatures although made to seem like real children are boring and essentially boils down to ape picks up man, god slaps ape, ape goes ""ooh"", ape picks up another man. etc... i suppose eventually the ape will learn not to pick up the man but you'll have flogged this game by then.my rating: zipmaybe 4/5 if you coiuld use the cd as a coaster maybe"
5,This Game rules Don't listen to people who put it down,This is one game that is worth playing and needs a rater large amount of intellect to play and some skill it has features that are unique to the game that are worth the play all i say is try it and make your own decision
4,B&W one of the best stratagey games on the pc,I dont't care what all you other people say this game is just fine. sure the controls are a little messed up but i'm fine with that. I figure that the controls and how the enemy god put's up the sheild are the only downside. Overall this game is pretty good.
2,I am sure this game is fun but...,"Ok, I read the reviews here and on game sites for this game. It sounds like fun, but my god could it be any harder to play? I gave up on this game due to its overly hard to use interface and overly annoying tutorial!I am they type of gamer that likes to get to the action not watch 20 minutes of video about the game. Of course the first time I ran the game it crashed luckly I am running Windows XP so I didn't need to reboot.To do simple things in this game it takes great skill and the learning curve is a pain. Having to remember where eveything is, becuase damned if I can fine a small map to show important things like Age of Empires has.The concept of the game is really cool, however attempting to play it well that is another story all together."
5,A Great Game,This is a very good PC game. It has 1 or 2 bugs but not that many. Overall this is a very good game. I would highly recomend it to anyone who is interesting in buying it. It is not buggy. Very good in fact. Get this game. Me and my friends play it at each others houses and we all love it.
2,"Great UI, poor gameplay","First the good: This game's user interface is outstanding. It is rich, well developed, and quite pretty. I found it easy to get a handle on how to use it.Now the bad: The designers spent the whole time on the UI and forgot that the game should have some sort of enjoyment other than the scenery. The game was dull, dull, dull."
2,Not Satisfying,"The game has an incredible look and feel to it. However, gameplay is repetitive and becomes boring rather quickly. There are only five levels to complete, and while each level has its own challenges and quests, there is not enough action and most of the challenges are too easy. Additionally, there are ""bugs"" in the program and some promised features are not activated. I have been unable to complete the game because of the ""Land 5 Creature Curse"" bug. (For more information about these problems you can check the bulletin boards at www.bwgames.com. A patch has been promised by early June, but it seems too little too late.) I would not recommend this game other than as a curiosity. It has been overhyped and does not deliver enough bang for the buck. If you think you want to buy this game WAIT FOR THE PATCH!"
2,Underwhelmed,"I purchased Black and White on the advice of a friend and was told about the fun aspects of training a pet. After playing for several hours I can honestly say I was underwhelmed.While the game's graphics were good, and I had fun for about an hour playing around with my pet and the world, there was little to keep my interest. I quickly moved onto other games and forget that I had purchased Black and White. For me, there was little substance and little to get me ""hooked"".While I do not deny that there is a market for games like Black and White, I do believe that this market demands more challenging and compelling products.If you make it past an hour, tasks become tedious, lifeless and dull."
1,Black & Blacker,"Somewhere between 3 and 5 years in the making, Black & White disappoints and irritates on so many different levels that it's hard to know where to start. The non-intuitive control system takes hours of getting used to, and even then is clumsy and unresponsive. The graphics are not on a par with such recent titles as Giants or Sacrifice, the landscape morphs and warps as you move around it and the villagers, well, the less said about them and their unfeasibly large feet the better. The sub-plots are supposed to be humourous but are merely twee, as are the good and bad advisors. Much has been made in the gaming press of the creature AI and it may well be the best ever in a computer game, but the game itself, which should surely be the most important part, is sadly lacking. This may well be selling swiftly, but will be returned to retail outlets just as fast by all but the most persevering of gamers."
5,REALLY 6 STARS,"This is the most incredable progam game ever developed. I, and everyone I showed it to agree! I am not saying there arn't any great games out, but this game keeps you going and going............like the energizing bunny. The grafics are SUPURB; Storyline - PURE GENIUS'S Vary hard to stop playing. I played it so often I bought another one because I scrached mine up shoving it in the CD-ROM so fast. TRY IT. I believe 95% or more people will fall for this on. PURE GENIUS'S[spelling offa bit] See how excited I am."
3,Black & White...,"When I originally reviewed this I gave it more stars. That was because this game is very original, and quite fun for a short period of time. The graphics are excellent, as well as the various depictions of one's pet.That said, the fun is rather short-lived. The game progresses much too slowly and it really becomes a 3d version of a ""pocket pet"" or whatever those things are called. I don't think it's worth the time or money with so many other more enjoyable time wasters available."
3,I thought it would be more fun.,I'm nine but i know my games and this one was a three star.The Movement is just plain irritating.I mean grab the landscape......Its just plain maddening!I wouldn't reccomend you buy it but it's up to you.Jonathan Davis age 9
2,Lionhead does not have any common sence,"Basicaly the game is good but it has not been tested properly. There are bugs that will cause it not to work with Win2K at all. I was told to contact EA for waranty Info on returning it. The Patch situation is just as bad as when ME came out. BWgame.com has very little info on patches.. basicily they are giving excuse after excuse. no real sincere apology, or indication that they will deliver a patch soon. Just empty promises."
1,Just wait!!!!!,"Anyone who reads this, just take my advice and DO NOT buy the game right now. Depending on when you read this, check ... and see if there's a patch released for the game. If there is, then most likely you'll be happy with this game. If not, please leave it alone and come back to it later. Lionhead Studios put out an unfinished game and I don't think I've met anyone yet who has beat the game without having to start over due to game-stopping bugs. If you'd like more information, head over to ... and check out the Suggestions forum."
1,Too Buggy to Play,"I'm sorry, but this is one of the buggiest games ever! I can't even play the game! I've been waiting for the patch for some time now, but guess what, it keeps being DELAYED! Game Over!"
2,Entertainment for a time,"While Black & White contains some entertainment value, it becomes tedious after awhile. It starts out fun, but too much of your time is gradually wasted with micro-management for your worshipers. The AI creatures are very cool however, they really do learn and are able of performing some neat tricks. However again too much time is spent teaching them basic actions that should have been a lot easier (2 hours of potty training is not really fun). Additionally the game is too short if you want it to be. You can blaze through the included scenarios fairly quickly if you put your mind to it. While playing with the creatures is indeed fun, the game bogs down too much in micro-management details, that should have been dumped in favor of more fun gameplay."
1,Too many Hours Wasted,"Black & White, you'll either love it or hate it, there'll be no grays about it. All the cool graphics only serve to tax your computer and slow down the game. The game is fun for the first couple of levels. But once the novelty wears off, the game becomes aggravating. The game tries to be everything for everyone, but that never works. I could have done without the stupid, impossible-to-control animal god, made worst with the awkward mouse movements. I want to be God, not some pokemon trainer. For a superior god simulation game, get Tropico. The gameplay of Tropican villagers are far more interesting."
2,Dissapointing,"While the concept of the game sounds inviting,I found it to be way too tedious and slow. The awkward movement methods and constant script interuptions makes for a very frustrating game experience (I thought such games were supposed to be fun). I made it to the beginning of the second level and decided that it was time to quit the game for good since any further effort would only add to my already high frustration level. Perhaps I was expecting too much as a result of just finishing Myst III Exile (an awsome game).Oh well, I tried it. Perhaps I can find someone with more patience and gaming skills than I who would appreciate a freebee."
1,Need latest computer! (0 star rating),"You need the latest computer to run this - and then some luck. My Win2000 with Matrox Millenium II (actually a Corona) display, 350 Mhz, SCSI etc, would not run it -- it just dies. The documentation does have a section on what to check when it just dies without an error message (kind of a shame the programmers didn't write an error message for all exit points) - anyway, I pass all the tests -- So, I think EA just figures it's my fault and that's that! It runs on my girlfriend's newer Dell with WinME, so she can play. Just a warning - you need the latest machine and some luck!"
1,Ten minutes of fun in a $40 package,"Don't waste your time.This is forty dollars worth of tweak, and not as much fun as a typical sim."
1,Boring,"I agree with most everyone else here, the game is boring. You do the same the actions over and over again, get wood food, give it to villigers and let them complain. Your creature does nothing really except walk around and get hurt, mine learned how to fish like 20 times but hasnt even fished yet."
5,Great Antenna,"Installed it on a pole in my back yard, which I figured would lessen the signal strength. Didn't seem to do that I can get every channel in my local broadcast area as well as many channels from other broadcast areas with perfect picture."
3,Not great in the attic,I purchased this product to be used as an attic antenna and it didn't work all that well pulling in only around 4 of the 8 local HD stations.
1,IT'S NOT WORTH THE MONEY,THIS PRODUCT IS WORSE THAN THE ONE I HAD IN THE ATTIC BEFORE. THE STATIONS WERE WEAKER THAN ANTTENA THAT CAME WITH THE HOUSE.
4,Outdoor hdtv antenna - recommended,"Works well, easy to assemble, used general hardware to attach to pole, performed much better than an indoor antenna. Fair Price"
3,"Didn't work, but not antenna's fault","As the title says, this antenna didn't work, even with a signal pre-amplifier, but only because there was simply too much cable between it and the receiver. The build quality was decent and it assembled and attached to the mast easily enough (watch your fingers, it can be sharp). The weather sleeve for attaching the cable to the antenna was less than ideal, but adaquate."
1,Didn't work for me,"After reading many of the reviews I purchased the DB4 antenna. It did not work as well for me as many of the other customers. I first tried it inside the house and it wasn't as good as plain old rabbit ears. I then took it up on the roof where I have a clear look at the eastern horizon. My closest station is 30 miles away and it still did not work as well as rabbit ears. The other two stations in the area (Torrington, WY) is located about 55 miles straight east of me and it could not bring one of these stations in at all. I have since purchased the Phillips directional antenna and have found it to work much better than the DB4."
3,It works ok.,I looked at these for a while before I bought. It works ok but I not sure it works as well as advertized.
4,It's ok,"On a good day we get 8 channels. 1/2 I never heard of. As long as it's not raining, snowing or the wind isn't blowing it's ok."
2,not worth it,"I got this antenna hoping to capture a couple illusive HD channels in my area. But turns out my Terk HDTVLP gets more channels, both standard and HD, sitting on top my TV than the DB4 gets mounted on my roof! Suprising let down after researching the DB4 on the Internet."
3,works very well for UHF HD channels but not VHF band HD channels,"This pulls in the HD channels from San Francisco's Sutro Tower or San Bruno Mountian that broadcast on the old UHF bands quite well where I live (in Palo Alto about 30 miles away). But it doesn't receive 11.1 (NBC) which uses the old channel 12 (VHF) frequency. Also channel 7.1 (ABC) will switch from its current frequency on old channel 24 to old channel 7 when analog channel 7 goes dark, and I suspect I will lose that too (this antenna only gets a weak and fuzzy analog 7 right now). In other words, I'm going to need to buy a VHF antenna in addition to this one to get all the major network digital channels. Check antennaweb.org to see what the frequency assignments will be for the digital channels in your area. The product description for this calls it an HDTV antenna but ignores that it seems to be just a UHF HDTV antenna."
4,Good product. Good price.,"I chose this one mostly due to price. Competing models can get really expensive for what they are. Picks up HD from my attic in a fairly rural part of the metroplex quite well. Not much to say about this, but it works and it didn't break the bank. Recommended."
4,did the trick,"I live in city of 1 million and mountains in area.with an indoor antenna, even amplified, I had nothing but problems - ie poor signals.Finally put up the DB4 under the old antenna on roof.bingo - signals of 10 for most stations.I still don't get one station, but that is do to distance greater than 40 miles.bang for buck this is the one."
2,Not all that great,"After reading a lot of reviews of this product and several other competing products I was not able to make up my mind so I decided to try it out. Before receiving this antenna I purchased an amplified GE indoor antenna that was supposed to be for HDTV. It received several channels well though others not so well and if you move the antenna's position it requires rescanning. I then hooked up the DB4 outside on the roof and aimed it in the direction of most of our broadcasts. It picked up some additional stations that the GE antenna did not but conversely it lost some stations that the GE picked up. I was not happy about this since the channels lost were ones I wanted. I then tried an old RCA roof top antenna of the variety popular in the 80s. It picked up all the stations of both the GE and the DB4 plus some additional stations. I have returned this and the other antenna because their supposed ""tuning"" for HDTV isn't what they purport it to be. My old analog antenna works better."
5,"Loads of power, fairly small package","I tested this in my living room through about 3 walls and I was able to pick up all of the stations I was supposed to with 90%+ quality connection. It is fairly small too! Not something that you would want to hang in your livingroom, but small enough."
4,great for the money !,"pretty good antenna for the money ,just hang it outside on my house wall and used a splitter (-3.5db) and I'm running 2 TV sets from it ,sometimes looses a signal on couple a very weak channels when airplane flays by...but like i said - 2 TVs hooked up - still getting over 30 channels - most of them HD ,my friend ordered DB8 antenna which is double in size and this one is even better but i live only 5 miles from Philadelphia PA and my friend lives in South Jersey about 30 miles from Philly and gets only couple channels less with DB8 - so if you are in greater distance than 20-30 miles from tower i would recommend to get DB8 antenna"
5,Very good antenna for price,Antenna worked great and is not to large to use in most places. Was able to pull in several stations.
5,Better than Cable or Satellite!,"We could not afford the satellite service anymore so we dropped it.We purchased this antenna along with the 40-inch antenna J-Mount. It mounted onto the house where the satellite use to be. With a little adjusting we are now able to get all the local channels in HD.The best part is that TV is now FREE, no more satellite bill.I highly recommend this product."
5,Picks up good signals and we're in a valley,"Of course your mileage may vary, but we're getting 15 stations and sitting in a valley surrounded by 60' trees. I have the antenna sitting on the ground outside because I haven't had the time to set it up on the roof. The picture quality is great - unless you're in a thunderstorm and then it's like satellite TV - worthless. But hey, storms pass and there's always board games to play in the meantime. :-)"
2,"High School Material, Sure... Creepy? Hardly.","I'm not going to give a long review, because the others are very well thought out and concise.I will only say that I was under the impression this video was going to be ""creepy"" or ""scary"" or at least maybe a little weird. It was none of the above.The puppetry (?) was very well done, and the sets and characters were all very cool looking, but it was a far cry from being a horror story, as Poe's original certainly was.The humor was juvenile and worn. During the parts that were (supposed to be) funny, I found myself shaking my head and thinking, ""Are you serious?""And the main characters voice... Oh man... It was hard to even watch it, with that guy squealing and whining the whole time...This would be an excellent movie for a high school literature class to watch, just as a goof. Other than that, I really don't know what else to say about it. Pretty disappointing."
1,Lindsay Wagner saves this boring melodrama,"I have been following Lindsay Wagner's career for years. First, of course, with The Bionic Woman, than with her numerous T.V. movies. Unfortunately, Ms. Wagner's choices have not always been the best. This is one of the examples. Voice of the Heart is sooooooooooooooo ridiculous. This melodrama is filled with poor storyline and bad acting (James Brolin and Victoria Tenant). Fortunately, Lindsay's abilities as a drama actress saves the day and this miniseries for being a total flop. The sound of Voice of the heart is also very poor. Unless, you are Ms. Wagner's fan, I do not recommend it."
1,Ugh,i thought her writing was worse than her class (and her class was REAL bad - how can a student attend only three lectures and get an A? this woman is supposed to be a learning specialist.)
4,Great product from a great seller!,Thank you for a perfectly wonderful book. It came quickly in the mail and was just as described as well as what I was looking for. :)
1,Not Reliable,"It broke after 5 or 6 uses. Unfortunately these uses were spaced a few years apart, so it was outside the warranty. I wouldn't recommend this item."
1,Plastic Junk,Very poor product. I couldn't get the hose connection to seal properly and the pressure was disappointing. Returned it within 5 minutes of use.
5,Old Skool Stuff,"It is awesome it has all the old skool videos and plus has a bonus video ""natural born killaz"" and u all will see tupac as a sniper its a kewl video"
2,Not so good,"First off, I'll admit that I didn't read the whole book. Now I'll say my peace on it. Hacker generalizes broadly about the behaviors and sentiments of both whites and blacks. Though white himself, he seems to absolutely despise whites across the board as either racist scum or well-meaning but idiotic. Then he says that Martin Luther King Jr. only came to prominence as a leader of the civil rights movement because the whites in power chose him. It sounds to me as if Hacker thinks that the black population were too ignorant to choose there own leader and allowed the whites to give them their hand-picked MLK Jr. The thought of that makes me ill. Apparently, in Hacker's world view, everyone except himself is either evil or stupid. But it was very entertaining."
4,little known musical,"(refering to VHS)This is one of the lesser known musicals and perhaps it doesn't have some of the innovation of ""Singing in the Rain,"" or ""An American in Paris,"" it is still a delightful musical. I have been a big fan of musicals for years and of Gene Kelly in particular. Kay Kendall is a delight, Taina Elg is lovely and very Parisien, and Mitzi Gaynor is darling as the down to earth American that keeps Gene's feet on the ground. The success of ""Chicago,"" hopefully shows Hollywood that musicals appeal is not gone just more sophisticated. Buy it for the fun of it."
5,Probably my favorite album in this genre...,"...and possibly period. As a lover of all types of music (Aesop Rock to Zeppelin), I can't recommend this album enough. I've had various CP/Crazy Penis/Crazy P records on both vinyl and CD for several years now, including this one, and I must say that they are my favorite producers of modern music. Their style is a mix of instrumental and vocal tracks that combine elements of dance, electronic, jazz, funk, downtempo and a hint of disco. It's excellent music that is both suited to getting warmed up for a night out, and for playing in the background for a dinner party. Either way, people will usually ask ""who is this?"". All of their albums are excellent, but this one is a good starting point. Do yourself a favor and check it out."
4,Works Good,"This mobile SATA rack works well, but I gave it 4 stars because of the open back design of the hard drive rack. You must screw the drive into the rack for it to work properly. I was installing two racks, one IDE and one SATA. I chose this rack because Kingwin is the only one I could find that has IDE and SATA racks that match. This rack works fine, but I have used better designed racks before."
3,So many options!,"It's a very light hearted and easy read and I was entertained throughout the entire novel. Anna needs to make up her mind, she has so many options! The ending for me was a little too abrupt and fairy tale-esque and didn't really tie in with the rest of the novel, but up until that point, it was very enjoyable."
1,TERRIBLE!!,I LOVE romance novels & have read hundreds! I have never felt the need to review one until now! This book is TERRIBLE! The story is all over the place & the man that Anna wants/ ends up with is mentioned only sporatically throughout the book. Very disappointing ending. Happy I only spent 99 cents on this!
1,Just didn't translate well for me.,"Perhaps I just don't get the Irish writing style, but I couldn't read this book. I read only maybe one chapter and I had to MAKE myself read that much. Obviously quite a few others disagree with that assesment but I wouldn't recomend buying this book without first reading the sample chapter to decide if you have to pay for it, or if it's free (it was when I downloaded it) there's obviously no risk."
2,Forgetable,I have finished this book couple of weeks ago and I already have just a faint memory of what it was about. I never grew to like the main chracter Anna. The side plot abot Claire did take away from the already weak main plot. I am giving it two stars just because I had finished the book and did not drop it in middle.
5,GREAT STUFF!,"I BOUGHT THIS ALBUM ON WAX BEFORE IT EVER CAME OUT ON CD AND IT IS A MONSTER.JACO'S FULL GENIUS IS ON DISPLAY(ESPECIALLY WRITING!)ALSO,WHEN THIS ALBUM WAS RELEASED THERE WERE ABSOLUTELY NO LINER NOTES ON WHO THE PERSONEL WAS.YOU HAD TO FIGURE IT OUT AND COMPARE NOTES WITH FRIENDS TO SEE IF YOU COULD COME UP WITH AT LEAST MOST OF THE LINE UP.GENIUS AGAIN!WHEN IT WAS RELEASED ON CD IT CONTAINS THE PERSONEL LINE UP AND ALL THE FULL TREATMENT YOU NORMALY GET ON YOUR CD'S.THAT ASIDE THIS IS WELL WORTH THE PRICE IN EVERY WAY."
4,Can hit!,"This recording is about 5 years old, but I think it wears well and I really like the crispness of Grey's playing (reminiscent of Buddy Rich, but never over the top). Her composition skills are impressive, as is her band Noisy Mama. Hope she puts out something new soon!"
3,A pretty good anthology,"The price is certainly right. I used this book to teach a high-school poetry class. The selection of Blake is the weakest part of it: the selections from Innocence and Experience aren't ample enough to give a real sense for the book, and exclude some lyrics that I just couldn't do without (e.g. the ""Holy Thursday"" of Experience). The complete lack of notes (which originally I thought of as a plus :->) led to some unnecessary pain for students -- I remember one attempted close-reading of ""The Extinction of the Venetian Republic"" which toiled slowly through the poem, dealing with mysteries that wouldn't have been mysterious at all if there had been even a brief note on the political context of the poem.On the plus side, there is not a bad poem in the whole book: every rift is loaded with ore. And it's an attractive paperback, nicely typeset, comfortable in the hands: it doesn't feel like a cheapo-cheapo book, which you'd rather expect from the price."
5,Best bang for the buck in this genre.,"This anthology is probably my favorite in this subject area. Stanley Appelbaum includes the major authors to the exclusion of some in the David Wright Penguin Classics edition.However, you will get all you need in this anthology. There is not one major poem by the major poets that you will miss. I took a literature class in college and was asked to buy an expensive compendium of English Romantic poems. Instead of buying the textbook, I purchased this work, and saved around $20.As I say with all the Dover Thrift Editions, for the price they provide the poetry, you get the bang for your buck. You do not get all the editorial commentary, but for the serious lover of poetry, that is not needed. These works stand on their own, and I like these poets and their poetry.I highly recommend this piece for all readers. It is a fine introductory book into Romantic poetry, if not all the poems available make it nearly definitive."
3,Too Much Michael,"This otherwise superb survey of American popular music is marred by far too much narration and singing from Michael Feinstein. The cabaret entertainer's talent does not stand comparison with the giants highlighted here, yet as the documentary proceeds Feinstein talks and croons more and more, his bounced notes anachronistic and his smile pleasant but seemingly frozen by botox. What a shame, because the filmed material is priceless."
3,Disappointed,"I have the live CD Last Nite which is great. So I bought this one only to find that it was not that inspiring. Good technical skills, but the music didn't grab me. I'm still a fan but I made a mistake."
4,"Alice Cooper - 'Freedom For Frankenstein:Hits&Pieces,1984-1991' (Raven)","Good Australian import CD release compilation.This is like my third CD title I've reviewed on the Raven label.One thing I've noticed about Raven CD's,are that whatever the artist,the compilations USUALLY feature songs that one doesn't see on every other comp. available.Total of eighteen tracks,with a running time of over 78 minutes.Wow!That's a long dang CD!I liked,hearing once again ""Teenage Frankenstein"" (who says that Alice lost his touch in the '80's? No way!), ""Freedom"", his Spirit cover of ""I Got A Line On You"", ""Hey Stoopid"", the eerie ""Sick Things"" and his stellar cover of Hendrix's ""Fire"". Comes with a nicely assembled l6-page booklet. Very nice. Recommended. While you're at it, check out other Raven CD releases."
4,"""Jewels"" is definitely the perfect name for this movie","Anthony Andrews is soooo good in this movie. I have been his fan ever since I saw him in ""The Scarlet Pimpernel""(for those of you who haven't seen it, you HAVE to, it's the best). He is so funny and charming in ""Jewels"". I love the humor, suspense and romance. It's great!!!"
5,Jewels,"OMG how long I have searched for this Movie. So glad i've finally found it. Seller was most helpful when I thought there was problems, but it was my fault!!! Would definitely buy from this seller again!!"
1,I tried,"I tried to read this book, a couple of times, it's so derivative and such a pale imitation of other, earlier writer's better work as to prove not worth the time or effort, sorry, my two cents worth. The one star is over-rating Gemmell's book."
4,Good 1960's romance,"This book, the 1960's entry in Harlequin American Romance's ""Century of American Romance"", covers the story of Jennifer Wright and Lij Brannigan.This story is set mainly during the summer of 1969.Jennifer is a reporter for a counter-culture newspaper, while Lij is a test pilot who hopes to become an astronaut. Their mutual attraction is deep. But Jennifer thinks Lij is too conservative, particularly about independent women, while Lij mistrusts Jennifer's hippie friends and lifestyle. After all, his wife Rona was killed and his daughter Amy severely brain-damaged in a car accident caused by one of Rona's hippie friends. Will they be able to overcome their very different backgrounds?I liked this book. There are very thorough descriptions of the moon landing and Woodstock, (which brings back memories for those of us who are old enough to remember!). Also, there is surprising new hope for Amy's recovery during the course of the story. Recommended."
3,and that's for the elf!,"I was prepared to love this book--elf?? blond hair?? the ears?? I thought I would feed my Legolas addiction, but I feel let down. This book just didn't do it for me. I didn't like Jane--Charlie seemed to wimp out after a while and I wasn't getting the Legolas feeling as I read. It was just sort of meh! I think there was a good book in there somewhere, but it never jumped out at me. I didn't get the impression that Jane really loved Charlie. I think she desired him, but love. I don't know. Anyway, I was disappointed."
4,A Fun Read,"This is a short book about creepy things/legends in Minnesota: UFO's, ghosts, strange lights, monsters, etc. The treatment is lighthearted, as is appropriate to such an offbeat topic. The chapter headings are illustrated with drawings which help to lend interest. There are a dearth of books about such things in Minnesota, and so this book is particularly fascinating to a Fortean aficionado living in the Land of 10,000 Lakes.If you read this book by day, you may smirk. If you read it by night, you may get the willies and find yourself glancing out the window..."
4,Last but not least,"Most folk's buying this show already know what it's about...This review is of the release it's self.The complete and final 24 show's for the fith and final season are packged here.The set comes in two slim cases with two single sided disc's in each case, each case has a mini summary of each episode on the back .The ""extra's"", arn't much , included are a Fantasy Island ( Rouges and Riches)episode and a Bewitched (Junior Executive )episode, I would much rather have had the bonsus's been about the show(as all the main cast -Hayden Rourke are still living).Personally I really enjoyed watching these episodes, even though it was the last season the show still had plenty of ""steam"" for a few more seasons. Too bad non of the tv movies were included .The show can be heard in-Englih, Spanish,Portugese.Subtitles- Spanish and Portuges(English subtitles, you ask ? Nope...I though that was odd.If you have season's 1-4 , season 5 should complete your ""wish"" to own this great show ."
1,Like a chocolate peanut....,"This movie reminds me of a chocolate peanut... once you get through the sweet outer shell,you end up with the dry,dull peanut inside. Although it does have all the usual delicious eye candy one see in other Bel Ami productions (Lucas,Johan,etc), it most certainly doesn't have any of the allure... The director clearly had a very bad day...the music's extremely cheesy, the scene's badly shot and composed....and just as you think something's finally gonna happen...well... it never does.Being an avid Bel Ami fan...this is definately NOT a movie I'll keep with the rest of my collection.It would certainly be the bad apple amongst them!"
3,Rod is definetly having fun.,"It is sometimes hard for a true rock fan to appreciate other forms of music being experimented upon by their favorite artists. But, with Rod Stewart, one cannot help but admire his music whether it may be rock, blues and the dreaded disco. This album sees Rod still having a hangover from the disco era. The selections are not that bad though. The pop sounding, radio friendly""Tonight I'm yours"" gives shivers down your spine once in a'while but you have to admit, it was a big hit in 1981. His cover of Ace's ""How Long"" is as inquisitive sounding as its predecessor, but it just is not Paul Carrack enough. And finally, ""Young Turks"". I'll bet $500 you are not going to hear Rod mention the title. For what it's worth, it is worth buying."
4,constitution consciousness,"Gregory Bondi has achieved an amazing integration of numerous disciplines and traditions in this treatise. He guides the reader through the types of constitutions and how different food types affect each of them. The result is a guide to balance through ""eating right"". The next level of interest will be to see how these guidelines work for people. I look forward to learning about these experiences with anticipation.I had the honor of reading the manuscript prior to publishing (as I'm the author's brother-in-law). This is a work well worth reading and a great addition to the discourse around the relationships between humans and what we eat."
2,ie7 workaround,"I too was having problems running this game on a xp machine with ie7, and then I found his website that had a work around that REALLY works. I was a little leary and skeptical to say the least, now after a year I have a very happy 5 year old!![...]"
2,Disappointed with video,"I wish I had read the other reviews before I bought this video! My son is 9 and has been an avid fan of Walking With Dinosaurs since he was 3, so this video has nothing new for him--so disappointing! If I had known it was a redo of WWD I definitely would not have bought it. Would not recommend it for anyone who has the entire Walking With collection, as we do!"
5,The Politics of Being Anti-Nuclear.,"An excellent book for those readers who seek the real story of the anti-nuclear power movement. As a citizen environmentalist and former newspaper journalist who covered the Three Mile Island incident--and as one who "" ""bought in"" to the anti-nuke, anti-science propaganda of the utopian '70s--this book is an eye-opener. I feel like a Moonie or Scientologist who has just been de-programmed. While there are flaws to the management of today's atomic stations, it becomes increasingly clear to the thinking, rational reader that atomics will indeed play an important part in 21st century energy production--both fission and fusion sources. A rare book with a brave voice. A rare presentation of technical and political facts, absurd agenda politics from the Left and Right, and notably the Left's politicized science and environmental doublespeak"
1,I WISH I HAD LISTENED TO THE OTHER REVIEWER,"VERY DISAPPOINTING ALBUM; I WISH I HAD NEVER BOUGHT IT. BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT I HAD BEEN QUITE IMPRESSED BY A COUPLE OF OTHER MICHAEL DAVIS' RECORDINGS (LIKE ""BONETOWN"" AND ""NEW BRASS"") , I THOUGHT THIS WOULD BE ALONG THE SAME LINES. I WAS NEVER MORE WRONG: SILLY DISCO GROOVE TUNES WITH VIRTUALLY NO JAZZ FEELING AT ALL. I KNOW MICHAEL DAVIS IS A GREAT TROMBONE PLAYER, BUT YOU'D NEVER KNOW IT FROM THIS RECORD."
2,Not satisfied,"Every year I looked forward to buying the newest in the NBA-Live series, with each year getting better and better. I was very excited to be getting this game, thinking it would be the best, but I was wrong. This looks much like a step back for EA. Examples are, there is no referee, now the ball floats into the air magically again. The crowd looks like cartoons, with very bad animations. The players now look like cartoons as well. Little things like that may not seem important, but when it was better the year before it makes the game bad. Try Live 98, 99 or 2000 if you want a good game."
2,Lots of Bugs,"This ia a great game,However it has lots of bugs and will cause your computer to malfunction,If you do not set it on the right setting.a.a."
1,EA has gone backwards with 2001,"This game is chock full of bugs. EA has done a terrible injustice with this game. It seemed like they werent ready to release this, but did anyway. There are no coaches in the game, which isnt a big deal. They did however forget to put Ref's in the game! The 2000 version had them, but for some reason they decided not to put it in. All in all. This is a major dissapointment waiting 3-4 extra months for a game which is priced extremely high for what you get. You would be better off playing the 2000 version and just wait for the 2002 to come out. Maybe they will get that one right."
2,Please dont make a mistake..,"Like i did and actually think that this is anything close to being even decent. Yeah you have your love making and all that going on but beyond that there isnt a reason to buy this. This is seriously bad in all respects. Actors (yeah, whatever-stink), Story (come on now seriously), even the guys in the movie cept for one maybe two are prety homely looking to be honest. there is only one redeeming quality to this movie. What is it?That it finally and mercifully ended at 55 minutes. It seemed like it would never end.I gave it two stars out of mercy, but even that is stretching it a bit. No need to buy this at all, seriously."
5,The Amazing Heart,"I have been a Heart fan since day one and everything they do impress me, though this CD is still one of my favourite`s. I love the way that the band puts their music and lyric together. It seems that Heart have made a huge impact to my life and I can only say Thanks. My all time favourite song on this CD is WOMEN IN ME even though it is a re make the way the Wilson Sister provide their special blend of emotion and vocal technique makes this song fantastic in every sense of the word. Thanks Heart for providing a fantastic CD. Paul"
1,"What an ""AWFUL"" movie!","This was not only one of the worst sports movies I've ever saw, it was one of the worst movies I've ever saw. The script was really bad, as was the movie making as a whole ... the absolute worse thing was the acting ... ughhhhh .... what was Gene Hackman thinking getting into this piece of trash. Hackman was in one of the greatest sports movies ever, in Hoosiers, but I've lost a little bit of respect for him, getting involved in this horrible film. What's even worse than this movie, is that it runs for 2 whole agonizing hours.All I can say is after watching this movie is, ""I'll never get those 2 hours back again!"""
1,bad,"i've seen worse movies, but not many. shocking is its awfulness and frightening in its mere existence, i would rather sit through the weekend at bernies trilogy than watch this movie again. by purchaing this movie you preclude yourself from ever being accepted in intelligent society. if you ""liked the honey, i shrunk the (insert something that would be kooky in a shrunken state)"" trilogy then you will love this movie."
5,allot of fun,this is another one of those movies that are really cheesy but still it's great for football fans.
5,"Love it, love it, love it!!","This movie is integrated with sport, love, job passion, life and team building. Even though it looks so simple of the basic concept in the spots, I love the spirits the characters leading us. I feel the passion to win the game. I am so wanting the cheif to get the love. In this complicated society, it's hard to see such a lovely movie. I just love it!"
1,The Replacements,"I purchased two of these DVD's for gifts and neither of them worked. After seeing the message of ""your DVD is dirty"" I cleaned both of them and then used another player, thinking that was the problem. I also followed the other suggestions given if the DVD didn't work. Nothing! So, beware. These DVD's are completely faulty. Do not purchase."
5,Great movie,Great and classic movie. One of my favorites and heart warming. I recommend to anyone. Case and movie have held up well this past year
4,Makes you laugh every time,"I know it isn't a top quality movie, but EVERY time I watch it, I laugh. Every time. So, it is a great movie for when you need to destress. It is actually one of my top 3 favorite movies of all time. I only gave i 4 instead of 5 stars because I know its not the greatest movie to anyone but me."
5,wish there were more episodes,"Great animation, terrific music, some fun stories -- featuring a girl with a big sword! Highly recommended for anime horror fans and those who like action and humor. I really enjoyed this series and would love it if future episodes were produced. The fourth ""episode"" is all music videos, so there are only five true episodes here.The originally released first episode isn't quite as light as the special edition version. Both versions are included on the first disc, along with a commentary track by the founders of AD Vision. Most of the episodes after this (other than the next to last one) are done for fun. My favorite is the next to last one. Awesome story!HIGHLY RECOMMENDED"
5,Objects of Desire,"This is classic Michael Franks. This is the album that started it all for me. Check out the track Ladies' Nite - he sings a duet with Bonnie Rait. This album also contains Tahitian Moon - a soulful song that always makes me wish I could crawl into a bungelow on the beach of Tahiti with the island girl he meets in this song. If you want a mellow collection of some of Mr. Franks greatest, this is it!"
3,"Nice cars, but...","I bought my three-year-old son the express coaches (there's two cars in the pack) for Christmas. They're very durable, and they have independent front and back wheels, so they handle curves well for their length (they're quite long cars.) Their height, though, can be a problem if you're train encounters a change of grade (going up or down hill.)My son insists on his train in a specific order, and that order has the coaches together. On the Figure-8 track, the tops of the cars hit each other when going up the hill, causing the cars to separate. It's such an inconvenience that my son separates all cars so they go over the hill one-at-a-time. The height is not a problem going under the bridge though.They're very rugged (a must for my son) and work very well on flat track (I haven't experienced any problems with curves yet) but for track that rises or lowers there's a significant problem with having these two cars adjacent on the train."
2,Too long for curves and slopes,"Although the cars are beautiful and no doubt they must be very durable, they are too long to handle well curves and slopes. I would recommend to buy shorter cars, because the more flexible the train is, the better it goes in curves and slopes."
2,Not quite a three star,"The acting was OK, it moves along nicely, but the story just doesn't do it for me. I couldn't find anything else the director had done, so maybe it's his first movie, if that's the case, it's not bad for a first time director. Acting was OK, David just didn't appear scary enough for me. He likes different roles, I suppose, but not sure I would want to see him do more horror films."
5,Fantastic fright!,"""The Cottage"" had me on the edge of my seat---exactly what I love! Scary, intrigue, great characters in the adorable David Arquette and beautiful Kristen Dalton. I'll see it again, as soon as my blood pressure returns to normal."
5,"Over all, Great info!!!","If your ever interested in Private Investigating some of your own issues, then this is a very good book to buy. There is nothing like being independent, as it has been said; ""If you want something done right, you'll have too do it your-self""!"
2,Low power is to be expected at 12 Volts,It does an average job with crushing ice to make frozen drinks. It can't be compared to a 125 volt AC blender however.You get a few small chunks of ice in the drink.I had to buy a manual ice crusher to crush the ice first then you get the consistency most people like .This is as good as it gets for outdoor drink making unlees you go to the gas powered blenders.(That's next )
1,Another book on turning,"This book adds to the proliferation of publications on turning. That is its sole contribution. The text is dull, naive, uninformative and repetitive. Many illustrations appear twice and some three times. I could find nothing new in it at all. Timbers are called ""exotics"" simply because they come from outside the USA, and then the names are misspelt - is that indicative of the global village, or is it simply parochial? Perhaps the author should stick to turning, although I find the results he shows of that activity not particularly inspiring either."
5,best bean thead at great price,"this is a really good bean thread product. easily cooked and good for you!, arrived in timely manner well packed and this price is fab. grocery store price here is $3.99 per bag same size.cellophane"
4,Great Movie!!!,"Forget what the so-called ""pros"" rated or rather under-rated this movie. It's a really funny movie. Tinker and Junior absolutely ruled and stole this movie(forget about Baby who is far from sexy, she needs to eat a sandwich). I couldn't stop laughing, I'm waiting for a sequel hoping Tinker will finally get to shoot or at least shoot at Earl."
2,"Cheese, anyone?","So, I first saw this movie upon the request of my boyfriend, who like me, lives in Texas. It's not an awful movie, it has a few spurts of comedy, but for the most part it's just one cheesey cliche moment after the other.And I'm also worried that out-of-state viewers of this film (though God knows why they would want to watch it in the first place) might get the wrong impression of Texas. It's not just a bunch of BBQ joints and bars and boots and cowboys. Sure, we've got it all, but this movie makes it seem like California is salvation in comparison.The acting was not terrible. The script was less-than-clever, and an actor can only do so much with what he's given. But accents go in and out a bit, and it just wasn't entertaining. It was cute at best.I would say, okay watch the movie. But only if it's free. And only if you are prepared to roll your eyes."
4,A silly romp that's fun and quirky,"Doesn't take itself seriously and thus makes for a charming 90 minutes with Earle and Baby, Junior and Tinker, and...my personal favorite, Jimbo, played by Matthew Davis, a very cute small town Texas gay cowboy."
5,Best Italian leather shoe ever!,"Comfy, sexy, casual, professional, etc.... All of the above. This shoe is the best and I have over 500 paris from Jimmy Choo, Prada, Christian Louboutins you name it! I am buying another pair in fact!"
2,Treatment of Complicated Mourning,"I ordered a hardback book and was twice sent a paperback. The return process was very convenient, however, it would have been my preference to recieve the appropriate product the first time. I still have not received a hardback edition as the packing slip indicates. Now Amazon says that it is a problem with their handling and I don't have the text book that I wanted. I'll have to go elsewhere. I give this 2 stars only because of the easy return policy."
1,wrong thing thanks to a wrong pic,"The pic previewed with this bit is the wrong pic. The description is for a dbl headed router bit. If I had been paying more attention, I would have caught the mistake. I wanted the bit in the picture not the description. The picture of a 45 degree router bit you don't seem to carry in stock, and i had to go elsewhere to buy."
3,"talented and studied, but incomplete","I have read each of Rosanna Penn Warren's books of poetry. I can say that she has a gift, but unfortunately, that comes through with glimpses, that she allows in poems, which I actually do remember for long periods of time. There are poems that I remember, but much is overshadowed by the bookishness of many poems, in which, her visions are not brought to completion in my eyes. I do not mean bookish words, but obscure bookish stories in other languages, that are not on these pages. Truly, I do believe that Rosanna Penn Warren could be a great poet, as she does have an exquisite handle on her language and subject at times."
5,So glad to find this,"This used to be our ""we need a birthday present for a guy"" go-to when my children were in their teens. I wanted to find this to give to a young man in our church who is going through some challenges, so I was happy to once-again find something on Amazon I could find no where else. This book also shines in the dark!"
3,can't use cord,I am sorry but this cord will not work on my sweeper Thanks anyway and we may try something else.
1,"Actually, this book is terrible","I just picked up the guitar again -- I played guitar briefly, and very badly, years ago -- and was hoping for a quick refresher course and a little more. This book, alas, is just terrible. The organization is illogical and confusing, important topics are given very short shrift while unimportant stuff fills page after page. Most of the book could charitably be called filler. The book is terrible as a reference book as well; useful stuff like scales and chord diagrams are scattered about the book, and many of the diagrams are hard to make sense of. (He doesn't even explain the correct tuning for the guitar until page 170, in a section on how to play slide guitar -- I had to look it up on the internet.) I chucked the CD into the trash. For scales, I found ""The Ultimate Scale Book"" to be about a zillion times better."
3,My graduate course book,"I've been using this book for a graduate class at WSU. The book is helpful, but written with limited field imput and a lot of theory, which can be difficult to digest. I often find myself refering to Fetter's Applied Hydrogeology or the web to figure out what the authors are trying to say."
4,Good Laptop,"This is a good laptop for the price that I paid. I was looking for a basic reasonably priced notebook and thats what I received. I guess it could be called a basic notebook, but yet its cd and dvd playback are better than what could be expected for this model. I had a minor problem with my cd rom drive though, a crucial part that would play my dvds and cds was loosed and misplaced so I ended up buying a replacement internal cd rom drive, which wasn't too bad. It set me back about ten dollars. In general I think its very dependable most of the time for what I need it for."
4,"""This Traveling Band Was Not Well Recieved...""","That sentiment, from the album's ""Big Star"", sums up more than a decade's worth of frustration and confusion as the Jayhawks found themselves suddenly without co-founder Mark Olson. It is in this bare-bones and honest assesment of his friendships and his career that de-facto leader Gary Louris turns in his and the groups most personal album to date. In stark contrast to 95's ""tomorrow the green grass"", the guitars are turned waaay up, the harmonising almost vanquished. This is one of the best rock bands in America crashing down, determined to re-invent themselves without playing to modern gimmicks. This is an all new Jayhawks. Hallelujah."
4,Cardiosport,I decided on this monitor because it has user changeable batteries unlike most other popular brands that you have to return to the company just for battery changes. I am very pleased with the monitor and the chest strap. Amazon was very efficient in the shipment and item was in stock. Not like with a few other companies I tried to order it from first. I would recommend this heart rate monitor to my friends.
4,THIS CD SURE IS BANGIN',"DON'T GET MISLEAD BY ITS COVER, THIS IS NOT AN ICE-T CD. THIS CD IS A 5-TRACK EP BY A GROUP CALLED THE WEST COAST RYDAZ. WHILE THIS GROUP IS HIGHLY TALENTED, ICE-T IS SORELY MISSED AFTER HIS SHORT VERSE ON THE TITLE TRACK. HOWEVER, ALL OF THE SONGS MANAGE TO BE PRETTY GOOD! BEST TRACK IS ''NATIONWIDE EASTSIDE''. I'D DEFINITELY RECCOMEND THIS EP TO WEST COAST RAP FANATICS. THIS IS A VERY WORTHY EFFORT. BUY THIS CD ONCE YOU FIND IT. TRUST ME, THIS IS ONE CD YOU WON'T FIND IN YOUR USUAL CD STORE!"
5,VERY MOVING,"West of Then is a very moving memoir about a daughter's love and forgiveness towards her mother. The way Tara Bray Smith superimposes the history of Hawaii with her heartbreaking relationship with her mother is not to be missed. One is left at the end of the book filled with hope all is well between them and will continue that way. BRAVO to Tara Bray Smith on here first book, hope there are lots more to follow."
3,Kind of small but,Little smaller than I expected but holds enough for bussines trips. The Samonite quality makes the case.
4,"Very fun, adventurous dance album!","I recently bought this CD in January and have enjoyed it since the first few times I've played it! Lots of rare dance remixes on here! Janet Jackson's All Nite remix is very good, but it is no contest to the many surprises here. See Alice's Vision of Love, The ROC Project's Deja Vu, Self Serve's funky Ride the Pain, N.E.R.D.'s She Wants to Move, Lucas Phata's Never Be Alone and Dirty Vegas' remix of Days Go By are among the best on this album. Jason Nevins does a fine job with sequencing and putting the 16 songs in a continuous pattern and flow. Some of the songs here are those that he did a remix for."
1,Tribute! pfffff !!!!,The only reason I gave this one star is because there was no zero star rating. I am a serious Goo Goo Dolls fan and this is the worst possible tribute CD that could have ever been made!!!! I know for a fact I could have done a better job! They should have the tribute CD done over!!!
2,I didn't bother to finish it...,"I purchased this book for my book club and was terribly disappointed. This book is full of grammatical errors and mistatements. The author writes like a historian and is very lengthy in her descriptions of Ms. McDaniel's life. The cover is right when it says ""exhaustively detailed""...READER BEWARE!"
2,Tripe,I had looked forward to reading this book but was so disappointed. Hattie seemed a lovely woman and good actress but this book bored me to tears. And the repetition of complete paragraphs was disgraceful. Truly the worst book I have ever read in any genre. A shame Miss McDaniel's name was connected to it. Save your money and rent Gone With the Wind instead.
2,Disappointing,"I first listened to the Ramones (on a vinyl record) when I was a skateboarding-teenager. I was immediately hooked on their sound. But I went to college, got a job, got married, went to graduate school, and the Ramones became a receding memory (kind?a like my hair). Well, last night, after all these years, I bought ""End of the Century"". What a terrible mistake on my part. This album is not a fair representation of the sound that I remember. If you are, like I was, looking to buy a recording to enjoy, once again, the sound of the early Ramones that still pound away in your head you might want to buy another album. ""End of the Century"" will probably disappoint you."
4,LocC 40 has a tight solo!,"To bad they don't let you sample The Jackal Album here and light up a philly blunt, I've heard 40 Glocc do a song with the group Quest on Itunes, and I heard the song Leave Me Alone featuring Suga Free & Mr. Shadow. I know west coast rapper 40 Glocc, I just don't know to much about this album so you can't really smoke a bowl of buddah to an album you don't know too much about, other than it has appearences by South Central Cartel, Kurupt, Suga Free, Mr. Shadow, Spice 1 & others.Best songs are.....wait! U can't sample none!"
4,Hilter's War,"This was a very interesting and helpful book if one is interested in learning the German side of why WWII happened. If I was teaching a course on WWII, it would be a must read book. However, the edition I purchased did not have the necessary references and footnotes that would be expected in such a book, so I could only give it a 4 star rating. Like any good student of history the reader should question conclusions that do not correspond to previous known facts and use the questioning techique in one's reading of any text including this one."
1,Impossible to assemble,"I don't know about all the 5 star review people here, but the assembly instructions that came with this bike were for all Schwinn bikes, with a paragraph for ""if this is your bike, ...do this..."", followed by a paragraph for another bike style, and on and on and back and forth through different styles, totally intermixed, and for me, way over the top. I don't feel I am mechanically challenged but this was the ultimate, deliberate, total confusion on how to put this thing together. They couldn't have put all the instructions for one style in a contiguous listing? And each section was completely vague on what bike(s) it was referring to, like no model numbers, model families/ranges, etc., just vague high level descriptions. After 20 minutes of reading, I gave up trying to figure out what to do and passed the bike on to my next door neighbor who has a son, to build, and grandson, to ride, who could possibly make some sense and use out of this. And good luck to them!"
2,Schwinn,"Although the box looked pristine, the parts were strewn all over and as it turns out some screws and bolts came up missing. I don't think I will purchase a bicycle online again."
4,So much fun!,"I love my new trike! Hadn't been on a bicycle since the training wheels came off my bike at age 6, so I had no preconceptions about how to ride. My daughter, on the other hand found it difficult to ride and nearly hit a pole.The reviews on this bike repeatedly talk about how hard it is to put together. It took my daughter's motor head boyfriend something like six hours before he finally took it to a Schwinn shop for the final adjustments on the front wheel.He was frustrated, but I am absolutely thrilled with how fun it is to ride. The only problem is that my three year old grandson wants to play chicken with me on HIS trike. Oh, well..."
3,Good Bike,The Bike has fender issues. The rear fenders had to be twisted in order to line up correctly and the front fender would not line up just right to look normal. Overall the bike works fine but would expect better alignment from Schwinn.
3,3 wheel bike with some damage,"The shipping was great, I ordered it on the 16th Received it on the 23rd There was some damage to one of the back fenders and both back wheels were bent, But not bad enough my wife could ride it"
3,Mediocre bike,"The bike arrived with the box partially opened and scratches on the frame bent fender and nuts missing also the seat was damaged .No instruction .If you are not handy with tools, take it to a bike shop and pay for having it put together it took me 3 hrs ...with a helper...The bike is cool looking so I am the coolest mom on the black ...it pulls on the right ..I am having a hard time riding this bike"
4,Great bicycle for a senior.,I am enjoying the bicycle. It's great to have a 3 wheeler so I don't h ave to worry about falling off. Great purchase.
1,Shop Elsewhere,"Was on Sale on Amazon.com at Christmas for $189, After Christmas the Price went up. I bought mine at a local Bicycle shop, It rides Great! Shop around, Amazon Doesn't Have the BEST DEALS!!!"
3,All Scratched Up,"I was very disappointed when the box was opened to find bad scratches on the main ""neck"" of the bike, as well as two fenders.The fenders for the back are only supported on the inside of the bike. Therefore, they rattle against the basket.I am disappointed the Schwinn supports the poor quality of design and shipping."
4,Wheeling with my dog,"This bike has been a very nice way to take my dog for a run and not worry so much about tipping over. The biggest problem is that it is difficult going uphill because of not having extra gears and the weight of the bike. It has been a comfortable size and so far seems to be pretty sturdy. Almost all of the packing materials it came in were able to be recycled, I loved that."
1,Flaws!,"Bike was missing several pieces and the parts were not threaded properly, which caused the bike to be misaligned. Had a lot of flaws!"
2,Where's the realism,"What made the ""Walking With..."" series worth seeing was the creation of photo-like moving pictures of prehistoric animals as they may of been. ""Walking With Cavemen"" falls far short of this. Modern humans have bigger heads and higher foreheads than early Hominids. Putting actors in monkey suits results in unbeleivable pictures of early ape-men with big heads and high foreheads.This series has always tended to spoil the images with cheap melodrama, and this one even more so. In real biology the herbivores have to greatly outnumber the carnivores. In the ""Walking With..."" movies they always seem to have a world where its the other way round.Give us more beautiful images, and less violence."
5,Best Nancy Drew book Ever!,"I have read many Nancy Drew books and I am continuing to read them. This is my ALL-TIME favorite. The whole plot may not seem that exciting before you begin to read, but once you start you can't stop! The reason this book is my favorite is because there is exciting things that keep you on your toes throughout the book - but the ending.. it's just.. FABULOUS! It's so exciting! Unlike other mystery stories that just keep explaining why the villain did what, this is action-filled. Well, what happens is.. Wait, I'm not giving it away, you'll have to read to find out! :)"
4,Edutainment,"Proving that the words ""new and improved"" belong as a couplet, Stir It Up blows the doors off the old Blue Notes books on album cover art. Marrow somehow makes the historical and political hip, as Stir It Up imparts the history of reggae, all the while clamoring for a spot on your bookshelf, preferably right next to that bag of spliffs. The magical colors that splash the page allure even the most fastidious eye. Sorry Mr. Bond. I like my album cover books STIRred, not shaken."
1,King of Distortion and liberal insanity,"There's not much you can say here. Those who are left-leaning, actually those who are extremely left leaning, will enjoy this. Everyone else will most likely turn it off pretty quickly. In my humble opinion (I know, I don't seem very humble with the title of this review) this man is a dangerous entity in this country, only because he perpetuates the most popular lies of the last few years and is able to build a cult like following in the process. I realize he's a very intelligent man, but that's why he's been able to lie so succesfully time and time again. If your going to watch this then think about looking into the things he says, interpret them, think about them and research them. Much as anyone should when viewing one of Michael Moores steaming train wrecks of deliberate mis-information and lies."
1,Renowned Scholar??!! ROTFL!!,"More like renowned clown...This DVD should be seen immediately after ""Conspiracy Theory"" then it might be comprehensible to normal people, not just to loony hardcore lefties."
5,"If the media did their job, this would all be well known...","All of the hype of yet another botched election, and if you're following any of it, you should definately check this one out. The profound statement being made here is that we (American's) are the biggest terrorists ever. Don't believe me? Get the movie, then we'll talk. Many of the skeletons Professor Chomsky brings out of the closet, are certainly eye opening. Especially if one considers what Bin Laden said in his little press release. Definately worth checking out."
2,"Poor definition of terrorism, one-sided view","When I think of terrorism I think of achieving political, religious, ideological goals by means of violence targeted towards INNOCENT CIVILIANS, such blowing up airplanes, buildings, buses, nightclubs, ships, taking hostages. War, or support of war, even resulting in ""collateral damage"" (tragic in itself), is not terrorism. Many governments do it, sometimes with disastrous results. US involvement (or rather involvement of certain politicians with certain agendas) in the Middle East and Latin America was not always praiseworthy but Chomsky does not give a single positive example: peacekeeping missions, etc."
3,Interesting Reading...,I am a huge Joan Crawford fan who is always looking for a great biography to read on her. Joan Crawford: A Biography By Bob Thomas is good and well written. it covers the basics & lets you in on the private life of Joan Crawford. But my only complaint was that it didn't spend enough time giving you the intimate details on what it was like for Joan to make cetain movies & her relationship w/ her co-stars. things any classic movie buff/fan wants to hear. it fills in the blanks & closes some gaps but i didn't feel like i was there or that i learned something new. i'm still looking for the difinative bio on Joan Crawford...any suggestions?
4,I found it drop dead amazing.,"When i first heard the song ""...of angels and demons"" i have to say i was amazed. I was even more amazed when i found out there is only one guy in this band that does everything. Much like Graveland this is a true masterpeice that one man has created. Truely amazing. People that listen to such bands as, ""The Black Dahlia Murder, and Crystal Abyss would love this album with a passion. I give it 4 stars."
5,Good--Uses Mexican Spanish,"I like this book better than two other similar Spanish-English picture books I've reviewed because Scarry's book consistently uses Mexican Spanish words, which is what I'm interested in. Other books use some Castillian words, which is fine if that's what you want. But the authors should make it clear which Spanish they lean toward."
1,Horrible,"This movie is stupid, gross and a complete waste of time. Every copy of this video should be destroyed including the origional so nobody has to suffer thru this movie ever again."
3,Makes you dumber,"This movie is stupid, senseless, and actually makes you less intelligent while you watch it. If this does not sound like a bad thing, this is for you. Really, there is no actual star rating you can give, since the bad acting and utter stupidity are its main selling point. So if you have brain cells to spare, enjoy."
1,BIO-DOME SO STUPID YOY WOULD NOT THINK,"How could they do this to stpehen baldwin, how could they have a sweet baldwin into one of the most inspid, the most inconprehensible comedies i've seen, this is junk could you believe that Adam munach didn't even want to see this, this is so bad that bob barker says over bid this gets NO STARS!!!!!!!!! PAULY SHORE FIND A BETTER MOVIE."
2,awful but entertaining,"This movie is pretty bad - it's juvenile, predictable, and downright stupid. YET it is entertaining at times. It's not supposed to be Shakespeare and it doesn't try. It is what it is. You either love it or hate it!"
5,Fall for it,Adored this book...Lots of simple but tasty recipes. The apple recipes are particular favorites because few things say fall more than cooked apples to me. This book is my go to for recipes at any time of year because many of the foods can be enjoyed at other times. (Lots of the fall recipes just have fall names). I'm wanting to buy Autumn in the Country after enjoying Flavors of Fall.
3,one psycho killer of a tune plus filler,"Maybe it's looking back but ""Psycho Killer"" was such a powerful song on this album that the rest pale in comparison. It's a good album just not as consistent as Buildings or Fear Of Music which followed.Of those three this is the one I play the least now. I would rate only ""Who Is It?"" and ""Pulled Up"" as worthy of the Heads' lofty standards. The rest are just so-so but still far more listenable than most music now so don't let my slightly negative review put you off.I'm just saying, take it for what it's worth-- a terrific first album but far better was on the horizon back then."
5,2 Corinthians (MacArthur Bible Studies),inspirational. Well done! Recommend to anyone who is looking for a very thorough and understandable study guide through 2 Corinthians.
4,Logo Magazine Review,"Jim Diamond seems to be a more familiar name than Gordon Raphael these days, the Gories/Dirtbombs legend popping up more often than the proverbial jack in the box. He's got a far better strike rate than Raphael though, and whether that's because the acts he works with are more fully formed is a moot point, they're certainly more fully formed when he leaves their company. The Singles are a case in point, they hail from Detroit (of course) but they don't go in for all that sub-swamp blues/garage malarkey, rather they prefer to batter their way around a seam of power-pop that's more rock than roll. For a while there Detroit looked like it had been relocated to Louisiana, here though it sounds like someone's humped it on to a trawler and dragged it across the Atlantic to Liverpool. That's some trick, and this is some band.Writer: Suzie Q"
5,Great Progressive Pop/Rock,"Multi-talented singer/songwriter Tony Carey, who makes his home in Germany, recorded two terrific progressive pop/rock albums in the early 80's under the group name Planet P (later re-christened Planet P Project). This self-titled debut album from 1983, with Carey writing all the songs, playing most of the instruments, and singing lead vocals on all but one song, is an awesome piece of work, combining a strong pop sensibility & great hooks with dramatic, keyboard & guitar-driven progressive rock that reminds me of Pink Floyd and the Alan Parsons Project. The songs are all excellent, especially ""Static,"" ""Armageddon,"" the MTV favorite ""Why Me?,"" ""Send It In A Letter,"" and ""Only You And Me"" (with guest lead vocals by David Thomas). Tony Carey would totally top himself with Planet P Project's ambitious 1984 follow-up, the double concept album ""Pink World."" But this self-titled debut is an awesome album all on it's own, and it remains one of 1983's very best releases."
1,LOOK AT THE SAMPLE THIS IS NOT THE JOHN WYNDHAM BOOK !,"I was pricing The Crysalids and knew that it was called Rebirth when it came out in the US. So when I saw a $2.99 kindle version, I almost clicked before looking! Glad I looked. This is some other book called Rebrith, published in 2009 by some other author. Let Amazon know this is the wrong book!"
3,Not one of their better ones,"But it was just a quick little segment. Must say, did not miss the granddaughter. This episode reminded me how annoying she could be. But i'm glad to have another piece filled in."
4,In the Land of Giants.,"At only three episodes long this story does not outstay it's welcome, I find it makes a refreshing change from the ""Alien monsters want to invade the Earth"" type story. The scene with the house cat was a ""rip off"" or ""homage"" depending on your state of mind to The Incredible Shrinking man.A most welcome addition to my collection."
2,"Talk of the Town? Well, not quite...","Except for the great ""Talk of the Town,"" this is the most forgettable Pretenders album. A real letdown after their brilliant debut. But even in the face of adversity, with two band members' deaths, Chrissie redeemed herself on the next album, ""Learning To Crawl."""
3,Why pay more?,"I purchased Amazon prime which seems to be a real waste of money because 65% of the things I want to purchase is not eligible for the prime advantage, including the ZVM silicone skin case so I deceided to go directly to PC microstore where I found it on sale for $11.99 (that's $6 less than Amazon's price) and free shipping to boot. So I sugget you go directly to the site than purchasing it through Amazon."
4,"Good price, good quality","There are two supplements that I take on a regular basis; a quality,high-potentcy multi-vitamin, and flaxseed oil. I believe that Omega 3 and 6 are essential for many body processes and that most American diets are deficient in these oils.These seem to be a good value for flaxseed oil, and since it's something taken on a daily basis, you need to find an economical source."
1,kjs726,"This whole experience was terrible. First off, it took more than 2 weeks before I received it and I had to call the company to ask about tracking information because they did not furnish any. Secondly, it is NOT stated ANYWHERE that this was a ""Woman"" or ""Plus"" size. I ordered a medium, which, when received fit like a dress!!!! Obviously I returned it and they charged shipping AGAIN (no courtesy return). Cost me about $12 round trip on a $25 sweater vest! On a plus side (no pun intended), it is a nice sweater vest. I would not buy from this company again."
4,Readers Responce,"Silent Night by Mary Higgens Clark was an excellent book! I had never read a book by Mary Higgens Clark, but now she's my favorite author, and I can't wait to read more! The way that Mary Higgens Clark wrote kept me hooked through out the entire book, it really made me use my imagination!The book is about a family at Christmas time in New York visiting their father who is in the hospital. When a special present for the father is stolen by a woman, the youngest boy follows her only to get into alot of trouble.With passages from the book like:""He wanted to get to the hospital and watch Mom give Dad the big St. Christopher medal that had saved his Grandpa's life when he was a soldier in World War II."" and, ""He stuck the gun back inside his jacket, then reached down and roughly pulled Brian to his feet."",it is evenly kindhearted, yet suspenseful.This book is great for readers of all ages! If you don't like being anxious, or suspended this book maynot be for you."
4,GOOD HOLIDAY READ!,"Catherine Dornan appears to have it all--a comfortable lifestyle, a loving husband and two wonderful little boys. Then her physician husband falls ill with a life-threatening illness. The boys' grandmother gives them a St. Christopher medal--that saved her husband's life in World War II--and instructs them to give it to their father, and it will make him well. Although skeptical, Catherine Dornan does as her mother instructs and places the St. Christopher medal in her wallet for safekeeping. Little Brian Dornan however, the youngest of the two boys, is relying on that medal to make his father well again. So when he spots a woman pick up his mother's wallet from off of the ground while at Rockefeller center listening to Christmas carols, he takes off in hot pursuit. Brian has no idea what is waiting for him when he finally catches up with the young woman; and it soon becomes clear to Brian that St. Christopher may save not only his father's life--but perhaps his own.DYB"
3,"cute pics, cheap book","The pics were cute and my kids got a kick out of them, but the book was a flimsy paperback."
1,"Imaginative Execution, Poor Material","I agree with other reviewers that the ""expressions"" the authors have created in the fruits and vegetables used for the book are imaginative. However, I find the material totally inappropriate for young children. Too many of the ""moods"" are angry or domineering. I found myself carefully choosing word substitutions as I read it to my daughter. Her reaction to the book sums it up best - ""There's no Mommy or Daddy here"" - i.e. nothing comforting or warm.As our copy was a gift, it can't be returned. I will not donate to any local sources, as I am not comfortable with the material for anyone's children. Instead it is headed for the trash can. Hopefully the new book ""One Lonely Seahorse"" has a more positive outlook."
5,such a classic,"There is such an obvious attraction to the content of this book that it is impossible to read it at random. It is long enough to suggest that starting at the beginning of the book is the long way around to finding what everybody knows. I have been slipping into a pornography of power frame of mind, so what jumps out at me as being obvious is how well the Marquis de Sade works as a model for modern pornography. Any dirty old man could find millions of examples of thinking in rock and roll that could do this book in the road."
3,Good book but doesn't match....,I bought this book to accompany the Calypso steel drum. The notes and location of the notes on the drum do not match those described in the book.
1,Not worth the money,"I recieved this as a gift, and found that I couldn't make myself listen to the entire CD even once. The selections, though odd, do as promised. Several styles of music are covered, but I hardly feel Peter Jenkins' choices are representative of these styles. Aside from this, his tone quality is absolutely atrocious. this CD might be a good idea for you if you're in the market for an example of how NOT to play a clarinet."
3,VERY POOR PACKAGING!!,"WARNING WHEN BUYING THIS PRODUCT: When you purchase this product, it would be best if you purchased a plastic 2-disc empty DVD case. The packaging this item comes with is a poorly constructed DVD case made from a thick card-stock-like paper that is very tacky-looking and easily damaged. It is very poor quality, and if I could tell the people who designed it, I would tell them to shove their design up their own butt-holes.When I received this item the DVD case was wrinkled and damaged, but luckily the disc inside wasn't damaged and worked fine when I tested it in my DVD player. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THAT YOU TEST OUT THE DISC AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.The only reason I gave this 3 stars instead of 2 is because I like Futurama. Very poor design."
3,Cardboard slip packaging is crappy,"I hate the packaging for this because its cardboard slide ins and the discs will get ruined very easily with each slide in and out. I wish the packaging had plastic holder at least, I mean come on all the previous ones excluding #5 had way better holders and packaging.They got too lazy on this one in my opinion both on the packaging and also the show. The shows comedy seems to be slipping up a bit compared to earlier episodes. Other than that my biggest dislike is the packaging and harder to keep discs from getting ruined. I will not re purchase this item just because the discs got ruined like the company probably hopes for. If I knew they were packaged like this I wouldn't have even bought it to begin with."
3,Series getting a bit long in the tooth,"Storylines are getting a bit repetitive, characters not really evolving much at their core. Time to retire this series, much as I love it."
5,Good News!!!!!,"I have severely reduced my video purchases over the past couple of years, but I will always stay up to date with Futurama. This season doesn't disappoint. Enjoy!"
3,Why is this rated??,Every other volume I got was not rated... then all of a sudden I hear beeping all over the place. Talk about annoying! I think it's incredibly greedy when the creators expect buyers to pay more for a blu-ray if they want the unrated version. Come on folks!
5,FUTURAMA!!!,"Came in just in time for the holidays, I've been collecting all the seasons since 2010 and I'm just missing one 3 more seasons and 3 movies!"
5,Yellowjackets,"An awesome album, great performances by the whole band. This is a must for any Fusion aficionado's album collection; especially THE HORNET. What a tune. GET IT!!!"
2,after reading.... my expectations died,"like mentioned previously, the grammatical mistakes highly irritated me. i just felt like going through each and every page and correcting it with a red pen. i was also surprised that it was even published; even more surprised that i didn't go out and strangle the author after i was done reading it. there wasn't enough actual informational detail on the topic of the book, and being that this was the first book I've read on embalming, which is the career i want to pursue, i was disappointed with the lack of hard-core factual information."
4,Hoodie Mc Who?,"11-year-old Harold has an uncle who sells shoes, Harold makes his first million betting on the ponies, Harold gets to be the guest of the multi millionaire inventor of the zenburger in a castle decorated like a fast food joint, Harold becomes a spiritual guru. He has a gold rolls royce and wears just about the funniest hat you can imagine. While not my favorite Pinkwater in existance (that prize going to the utterly transcendant Young Adult Novel) The Last Guru is good clean and typically Pinkwaterian fun."
3,Kooky fun for the game lover in your life,"Enjoy this game, for Dreamcast. It is a lot of fun for parties."
2,healthy but broken,"It was important to me to have cookies WITHOUT hydrogenated oil as an ingredient so I was pleased to find this product. However, the way it is packaged and/or shipped, about half of them were broken."
1,Long Riders,DVD was damaged on reciept and since I did not have the packing materials I had to trash it and buy it again.
2,Two stars for novel casting,"First of all, I could have overlooked the historical inaccuracies of this film if it had still been interesting, but it wasn't interesting, thereby making all the historical inaccuracies that much more annoying. The script is terrible and the actors take characters (like the James' and Youngers) that should be exciting, and deliver their lines in a droning monotone that is simply sleep inducing. The story seems to meander all over the place as though the script writers (which included the Keach brothers) weren't completely certain how they were going to tell the story. The dialogue in several portions of the movie is painfully bad and plays like cheesy melo-drama. The movie seems to be going for a gritty and realistic tone, but it's rather flat and just plain dull. The only thing it has going for it is the novelty of the casting, and that is simply not enough to make it worth the purchase."
1,Noisy shoes,"Florsheim is no longer a quality product if I judge them by this shoe. They look fantastic. However, that is where fantastic ends for these shoes. These are so squeaky and noisy when I walk, that I don't wear them as it's embarrassing. Also,the heel wears out fast and with fairly big chunks coming off the heel at times. I thought that these would be step up from the Bostonians as the Bostonian heel also wears fast. However, do not pay more for this shoe."
2,You can get a better one.,"I find this book full of unnecessary information. One example is a chapter about health. If I want to know anything about biceps and triceps, I'll buy a book specifically on working out. (The author has also mentioned something about cholesterol.) One particular book I HIGHLY suggest is ""How To Succeed With Women"" by Ron Louis and David Copeland. It is worth every penny."
4,Another wonderful Exact Change release.,"Charles Simic, Nine Poems (Exact Change Press, 1989)Despite the great disparity in the look of any given book by Exact Change, you can usually tell it's an Exact Change book. Few other micropresses are as consistent in the quality of their output, both from the standpoint of the work inside and the construction outside, as is Exact Change. Nine Poems is no exception, published as a huge orange chapbook, one poem to a page. And this is good Simic, right here; the nine poems involved are all reflections on childhood done in the inimitable Simic style that mixes traces of surrealism, dada, sentimentalism, wry humor, and various other things in small quantities to produce the gems that flow regularly from Mr. Simic's pen.Long out of print now, I am sure. But well worth the search. ****"
5,Worth The Trip,"Redmond manages to find humor in difficult circumstances without ridiculing or belittling those around him. Yes, the book is long, but well worth it. His ostensible reason for the trip is just a thin excuse, disappointing and surprising no one when it isn't ""successful."" The ending, I found entirely appropriate for a journey of this nature."
3,Opinion on this book,"The first few chapters of the book are excellent and pertained to many of my interests. However, the last half of the book concerned itself with poetry and poets (as I might have suspected, given the title) and I found this part uninteresting, not being particularly into poetry. I had purchased the book because I had read some of Haines' writing elsewhere and was very impressed. I intend to pursue more of his writings in the future."
3,"good, but not their best","We are major fans of TFA, but were a little disappointed that this CD contained so much previously recorded material. We were expecting to hear new songs. Nowhere in the promo did we read that we would be buying our same favorite old songs, just recorded in concert with live audience. Still, I'm a fan."
5,You must get this one for your family.,Our family loves this CD. My husband and I love to sing along with this one and my sons request this CD as soon as we get in the car. Even my 13-yr old thinks this one is cool. This one is great for the whole family. We had never heard of this group and I'm about to order my third CD!!!
5,Love this handwriting program.,I absolutely love this handwriting program. We had tried handwriting without tears and it just didn't do well for my daughter. We gave this one a shot and so far she has really enjoyed it. We have gone through several lessons and she has not gotten bored yet. Her handwriting has really improved and she is finally not complaining about writing. We like that she also learns scripture while writing. It has plenty of practice pages and works really well with the skills your child has already developed.
1,Broke after a year,"I won't duplicate reports of the various shortcomings of this item, but would only like to add that mine broke after one year - soon as the warranty expired! It no longer plays MP-3's, and has become useful only as an ordinary CD player which skips a lot. Infuriating."
3,"worked great for a year, then it died","this product was the first of its generation in 2000. it was exactly what i was looking for to make the transition from cds to mp3. i used it and loved it for a year, and then it just up and died. inconveniently after the warranty ran out. i'm going for an ipod."
3,Save your money,"The best thing is the anti-skip. Other than that you will have to make a playlist on paper for every CD you have. You will need better grade CDR's. It is very picky on CDR's. The support is good, but doesn't make up for the lack of backlight, ID3 Tags and the limit of 8.3 naming convention."
2,I Expected More,"I purchased my Philips Expanium in March of 2001. I really expected more for my money. I was surprised of the quality of of the earphones. If I had it to do over again knowing what I have discovered, I would not buy this product.PROS: It plays audio CD's and MP3's, as it should and actually sounds good with quality earphones.CONS: The Display has very small lettering and is very difficult read.The earphones are very poor quality. The rubber cushions on the earphones are constantly falling off and are difficult to put back on. One of speakers actually split apart and no longer works. I had to spend a lot of time un-tangling knots in the wires. Different and better earphones are a must to enjoy this device."
4,"Not bad, but...","I have mine in my car, and for the most part it plays songs quite nicely, I've found though, that some times it gets up to 11 seconds or so and then stops playing. I'm not sure if it's due to bumps in the road, or poor CD quality (I've only tried CD-RWs).The lack of ID3 support and back light is a bit irritating as well. However few other players could allow me to cary my entire collection of CDs (well over 6GB) for as low a price as this does. My next player will likely be a jukebox type, but for now I'm not unhappy..."
4,Good.,"I absolutely could not get this thing to skip, I did everything short of breaking it...I dropped it, crushed it, tossed it, shook it, and...it still, wouldn't skip while playing an mp3 cd."
1,not reliable,"After a few months of light use as a desk-top player, the player shows signs of not being able to read music CDs or recognize that a music disc is there. The display is inadequate as there is no backlighting. The controls are tiny and not intuitive. The anti-skip function is also inadequate. This unit would not work well being bounced up and down by joggers."
3,"Great sound, but slow start","This product was not good. I bought it, and the sound quality was great, but it took like a minute to start playing. I returned it and got a cd/ AM/FM radio player (Aiwa)and it was great. I do not recommend this."
2,Whats the point??,"Bought it. Returned it.Pros:-It reads mp3's-It comes with a reciept.Cons:-Overpriced-Other models have way more options at almost 1/2 the price-skips-doesnt read folders names or songs-bugs galore, turn off it doesnt return to the same song, its sometimes skips 3-4 songs ahead.-sound is poor, and very low. I plugged it into my stereo, had to turn my stereo up full volume just to hear it..and it STILL was low!DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY! Buy the Memorex mp3 player, its everything this should of been, but isn't."
3,average device for an above average price,"The EXP 103 is cool because it can play MP3 files. It's not so cool because it is expensive ($), has very poor earphones that are too large to fit in my ears, does not take slight shakes very well, takes an awefully long time to recover from shakes, and has a very hard to read LCD screen. I think it should be fairly priced at ($)."
5,Must Read for All Flushing Spaniel Owners,"This is the main flushing spaniel ""handbook"" that we send off with all our puppy clients. Mr. Spencer has a wonderful knack for spanielling and explains the ins and outs of a working American spaniel, minus the politics, in a simple manner that even our British cousins can appreciate. It is a book that will never go out of style and should sit on the shelf of every flushing spaniel owner's bookshelf."
2,More Chineese imported crap,"Yes the unit is functional and mostly accurate with the barometer and temperature gauge, but to call this thing quality is akin to sacrilege. Again, made in China, no quality control and as usual another item I had to take apart and ""fix"" prior to it working properly. Albeit a simple fix this time of clearances for the arms due to the clock arms catching on the other two readouts. If the metal is truly copper it will represent the most ""expensive"" part of the clock, thin and lightweight, clear plastic face hot glued with 3 tabs, the rest cheap plastic well known in any ""made in China"" product. Was looking for a nice outdoor clock for the porch, while the facade is pleasant it certainly wasn't worth $40+, maybe a $10 clock and still a hefty profit."
2,More of the same,"Roger and his remaining bodyguard continue their trek to the spaceport, solving problems and acquiring new allies along the way.More of the same, so much so that it didn't hold my interest and I skipped chunks of the book before completely giving up. This series would have been a great single book, but there just wasn't enough story to stretch out into a Lord-of-the-Rings-style series."
1,Silliness,"Essentially asserts that, since knowledge is difficult to come by, and since certainty is virtually impossible because all experience is subjective, that the Bible should be taken as historically accurate.Asserts that believing that Jesus actually rose from the dead, requires the same amount of faith as believing that 2+2=4. Because we only 'really know' that 2+2=4 because we are willing to accept our current society's definition of '2.'Ignores that this same philosophy can be applied just as easily to defend *any* other system of faith."
5,Thank you! I love this movie so much!,Thank you! I love this movie so much that I ordered the blu-ray from you guys! Now its a big hit with along with my collection.
5,The Good Gora on Pyaar impossible,The movie and music complemented each other very well. I listen to the music almost every day.
1,bollywood movie my ass,"I was looking for a romantic Bollywood movie bout an underdog winning a girls heart. I was expecting a performance a notch below SRK. Boy was I wrong. This movie has more English lines than Indian, da songs are terrible, the dialogue even worse, and priyanka Chopra's acting is simply unbearable. Simply put if u are a fan of old school Hindi movies such as KKHH, DDLJ, KKKG, RNBDJ, etc, and are seeking similar romantic Indian entertainment than run in the opposite direction if this movie. I wasted 2hrs if my life with this garbage, save your 2hrs for anything else."
5,A theme of unity,"I hope this book would proof for flourshing a national brotherhood relation among the family of One Living ALLAH. In the pursuance of the saying of the holy Prophet Mohammed (on whom be peace): ""O Lord! Lord of my life and of everything in the Universe! I affirm that all human beings are brother to one another"".And I also hope that many lover of truth may wants to have this one-the amazing book contains the Beautiful Names of the One Living God-ALLAH in the Bible."
5,Some of the best from one of my favorite bands.,"Dire Straits has always been one of my favorite bands and although I prefer the self-titled album and Makin' Movies over this as an album, nothing on any album ever made will beat the song ""Telegraph Road"". It's 15 minutes of genius and I don't care what kinda music you like, after listening to it once you will agree it's the best. Private Investigations and Love over Gold are both like ok songs, but Industrial Disease and It Never Rains are really good too, although not coming close to the first track on the album.As a previous reviewer said don't let the fact that there's only 5 tracks scare you off, and this is a must-have for any fans of rock."
4,Pretty Good,"This is actully not a bad album from Dire Straits. But slower.The best songs on this are Industrien Disease, and It Never Rainswhich are brillant and rock. Telegraph Road is good but too longand slow. Go buy it mostly for those 2 and get this with all the Dire Straits before Alchemy or BBC. Thanks."
4,"Last FIVE star reviewers are all LYING TO YOU, they are whirligig","Triple H: Love Over Gold was a good album but not the best Dire Straits album. Shawn Michaels: They are good but not as great as Rush or Slayer! Triple H: The best song on this album is not Telegraph Road, whough it is cool, but It Never Rains! Shawn Michaels: I personally like Industrial Disease, Private Investigations and the title track. Triple H: Love Over Gold was good but not as great as Iron Maiden's Number of the Beast album. Shawn Michaels: Or Rush's Signals album. If you are not down with DX, WE GOT TWO WORDS FOR YA(crowd yells ""S*CK IT!"")"
1,Completely Useless,This product does not perform as described. You need a converter to convert the digital signal from a HDMI output to the analog input using Component video and Audio. Converters are available at Amazon.com. Please discontinue this product or ask the seller to provide exact specification and description of this item and what it can be used for.
1,Poor Picture and Audio,"I bought these cables thinking, ""eh, a cable's a cable, right?"" and that I was getting a great deal at $7. Unfortunately I found out that not all cables are equal. When I plugged this into my TV I instantly noticed rolling lines in the picture. Not terrible, but definitely noticeable. On top of this, there was a ton of line noise with the audio, so if I turned up the volume much there was a very loud buzzing.It may have just been a lapse in QC since a lot of people seem to be fairly happy with these cables, but they didn't work at all for me. I ended up having to return them and just bought some Rocketfish component and RCA audio cables at a local Best Buy. It was $40 instead of $7, but they work perfectly. If it's something that you're going to be using a lot, I'd recommend that it might just be worth it to pay a little more for something higher quality that you know will work."
5,The Perfect Answer --,"Amazon.com's low price and speedy delivery on a much-needed Component Cable was just the ticket for connecting my HDTV Cable Box to the 52-inch Samsung LNA650.Amazon has top-quality cables for MUCH less than they can be had at the big-box stores, and the quality is just as good (often better!), too ..Highly Recommended !!Peace.Slik"
5,"""The Circle"" is very good","""The Circle"" is part 2 of a 3 part story involving Li Nalas, a Bajoran war-hero, and the political situation on Bajor. ""The Circle"" has an epic feel as events unfold and the characters are powerless to stop them. Tensions rise throughout the show and finally culminates to the nail-biting conclusion where...ah, I won't say. This story mostly involves the Circle, a group of Bajorian extremeists who are trying to overthrow Bajor's provisional government and expell all non-Bajorians. The politics are up to the series' high standards. Everyone (as is standard for this show) delivers wonderful performances. All in all, this is a stellar show."
5,A BARGAIN...EXCELLENT QUALITY,"I guess the person who gave it 2 stars didn't read the product description so he decided to give the item a bad rap. I bought 4 sets of these sheets with the matching duvet covers and the matching shams. My girlfriend thinks I'm the greatest thing since Martha Stewart (haha) The quality is excellent, medium weight flannel that washes well without all the pilling. The shams are very soft and hold up well after multiple washings, AND........you can't beat the price. BUY THEM!!"
4,Great except...,"This book is amazing if you know nothing about Buddhism. Its full of facts and history, but the only thing it was lacking (or maybe it just didn't answer my question) was the actual practice or discipline. It briefly touched on the subject of meditation and how to do it, but thats about it. Otherwise this book is excellent!"
4,Forthright and honest,"""Kit! Kathy is in the top of the hemlock!""Yes, I know. Don't scare her. She doesn't know that it's dangerous.""That exchange between a concerned neighbor and a small girl's mother offers a telling glimpse into the childhood Katharine Hepburn's parents gave her. Being adventurous - physically as well as intellectually - was simply expected.No one should pick this book up expecting a conventionally structured, conventionally worded autobiography. Miss Hepburn tells her life's stories as if her readers were sitting down for a visit. She moves through her long life in approximately linear fashion, but she never sticks to a timeline when doing that would keep her thoughts from flowing freely. She's frank without being vulgar, and she describes her own behavior - including those times when it was less than admirable - in forthright, honest terms.An interesting look into the mind and heart of one very interesting person."
4,Katharine Hepburn review,I havn't got to read this book but it looks very good and i'm sure i'm gonna love it.
4,its ok,you should but this if you are just starting out but if your experined guitartist then liik for a more advandced guitar
2,mixed feelings,"I love the show and the books but this game is so bad! the graphics are horrible the characters arent easy to control and its way too easy. If you want a good sabrina game get SABRINA THE TEENAGE WITCH : BRAT ATTACK , now thats a good game!"
3,"Cheep, Cost Effective, Okay Sound, No Comfort","These are not high end earbuds by any stretch of the imagination. They, like many in their class, will practically eliminate any bass sounds. It is important to note that these earbuds are completely hard plastic meaning there is no comfort when you have them in your ears. After a few hours, they can get to be really irritating."
5,great album!,"i heard this on vinyl back in the early 70s on a friends nice stereo and liked it and bought my own vinyl a little later. recently just got it on cd and its nice to hear the variety and quality of the songs that this group laid down. i just wish they'd stayed together longer and done another one. anyway, don't listen to the naysayers, they are stuck on Peter Green, this not THAT band, but another with something refreshing to say."
4,great hair product,great for your hair feels soft and does not cause any greasiness. you can use it everyday love it a lot.
5,"It did the job, best so far....","I rented this movie today thinking it was going to be bad because of the poor ratings here. Well, it made me jump several dozen times, even made me yip and scream. I had to cover my eyes a few times. I watch alot of horror movies and this was very frightening without all of the blood and guts. The plot was okay and tied in with the first movie. The ending had a very odd twist. I liked it alot and won't forget the imagery and shock value anytime soon."
2,OMG really!!!!!!!,i cant believe i even rented this movie........... i mean REALLY!!!!!!!! this was the worst PA ever. i hope they dont come out with another one. REALLLYYYY !!!!!!! WoWIm sorry buts thats all i have to say.
4,Up and down,I think this is the best since the first paranormal activity but it was a bit over the top at times. If you like over the top movies this is your movie to watch
2,Telling me no play,It's not playing and it's only playing the previews And i cleaned it and still saying no play what can i do
2,Scarry but a huge disappointment...,What was that ending aboutl. I really dislike movies that dont have an ending... are they expecting us to see PA5... not worth it.
3,"Still puzzle, didn't explain things, I'm glad I didn't see it at the movies.","So I've seen the other paranormal activity movies, and I thought this was going to be explaining but NO.! ?"
2,boring,the movie was not worth the money and I will not watch again but such as life win some lose some.
1,P,This movie SUCKS! You can predict every scary event that's going to happen.Then at the end it was more like a zombie movie.
4,Previous ones were good,"Haven't watched it yet, but I'm sure it will be as good as the previous ones. Look forward to watching it soon!!"
2,Let down,In the fourth installment of paranormal activity we finally get to see what happens to Katie and Hunter. We also get to same some of the annoying questions answered. That is where the movie falls short. This movie tells basicly no information on The questions left us in the movies. It seems like they wanted to leave it so open that they decided not to give any information. The time however was not replaced with any extra scary scenes. In fact there was only one or two scary scenes in the movie. The rest of the movie was filler scenes. I would not recommend this movie to anyone. Even a huge fan of the franchise can see they have nothing more left to do and are just doing it for the money.
2,Not very good,They are going to far with these movies. This movie is no where near as scary as the last three.
1,Really lost it's luster,"I really liked Paranormal 1. Watch it alone, in the middle of the night, with a beer or wine or two. Very fun, creepy movie. But it's really gotten old by now. In 1, like the Blair Witch project, you were supposed to think it was found footage.But in this movie, the daughter finds a way to record everything all over the house, and the recordings fail as part of the plot. SO WHAT ARE WE WATCHING!!??The parents don't even bother trying to act, and I stopped bothering trying to pay attention. The end of the movie is so half assed, you'll wonder what you did with the last two hours.Sorry, I love the first one, but 4 was terrible."
2,Same old same old,"Very boring, i can't believe i made it through the whole thing, without falling asleep. If you liked the others, then you may like this... because it was very similar..."
4,Perspective.,Stand alone the movie would get 2 stars. But since it is a continued story I have 4 stars for the series perspective.It is what it is. 93 minutes of entertainment you don't need to rewatch but weren't mad you spent the time on it.
1,Stop...just Stop,"They really need to stop with these movies. Honestly, the only good paranormal activity movie is number 3. Don't buy this crap...even if you're a fan of the movies"
2,Melinda,"I was disappointed by this movie. I really enjoyed 1 and 2 (missed 3), but 4 was dull and un-scary. There was too much screen time of just looking at empty rooms. I would not recommend this particular movie."
3,A complete guide to understand modem design,"This is the only book about modem design i have found for a long time. You may find the concept, architecture and implement method in the book. I expect the author will write a book about the real example of modem design."
5,better then the first,"this dvd was better then the first one, as i wasn't too partial to any of the episodes chosen. but the episodes on this DVD are better. it even features one of my favorites of all time when al builds his own room with his dad's hammer.the episodes chosen make this DVD more then worth every single penny, go out and buy it today."
5,best show,ive never laughed so hard and the audince too als the start of homer simpson and patrick star but only patrick and al are goodv shows so funny its even funnier with griff and jeferson
1,"Billed as a ""how to"" book, there is no ""how to"" in the book.","The subtitle of this book, ""How to Establish Your Own Private Foundation,"" should be subtitled ""Why to Establish Your Own Private Foundation."" The book is long on generalities, and the so called ""conversations"" that the authors call ""case studies"" are insulting. An example: ""Cool,"" said Danny. ""Can I smoke a big fat cigar?"" ""Get Serious,"" said Debbie. ""The foundation will take some time and effort."" ""Anything's easy after a two-year-old, then twins,"" said Danny. Please note that there are also factual errors in the book, not the least of which is computing the IRS 1-2% excise tax on a foundation's earnings instead as 1-2% tax on assets owned by the foundation (an error of a factor of 10). Don't waste your time or money on this book."
4,WORKS GREAT,This is a multiple use tape. Packaging and everyday repair jobs. The cutter on this is not the most efficient but if your careful it will do the job. Easy to cut or scrape your fingers on.
4,Basic packing tape gets the job done,"- If you order online, you likely do ship items back from time to time, this makes it easier!- Seals boxes strong- Easy to use dispensor makes it even less work- Delivered quick by Amazon, price is right, and nice to have in stock when you need it!"
4,"Strange, yet satisfying","It was good.The morality of the Bible is secondary to the narrative revelation of God. In any event its morality is not adhered to by anyone, so it would be well worth reading and living.I prefer Nobles and Barn to the Jungle people."
2,Not for picky eaters,"This could be a good dog food - but if the dog won't eat it, it does not help. They won't eat any other dog food either. I just thought this would be different. NOT!"
3,This chap is going to go far !,"It's a 1982 release, so you have to expect a slightly dated and flattish recording compare to the nineties or current crisper productions. That said there are a few corking tracks here which cut the mustard. Marcus and Omar (how good a rhythm section!) do the business when required, and the opening drum intro from Mr.Hakim on the best track on the album (Rush Hour), is so funky. Dave Sanborn is a great alto & soprano sax player, and even back in the dim and distant eighties, is sooooo much better than the suicidal tiresome offerings from today's smooth jazz dullards. Fans of Marcus Miller also will find lots of trademark twanging to amuse & bemuse. This album is real low cost now, so sling it in the shopping basket."
1,Powerful but too noisy andvibrates too much. Don't buy.,"The speed with which this blender purees is quite impressive. HOWEVER, the noise and intense vibration it makes are so annoying that I am sorry I bought it. Perhaps for a bar where it is on in 5 second bursts it would be satisfactory, but for my use -- mostly pureeing -- I found that I was dreading using it because it needed to be held to keep the vibration from moving all over the counter and with the noise I felt as if I were standing next to a jet engine revving up. I have since gotten a Vitamix -- a much more expensive machine but one which works smoothly, powerfully and meets my needs. If you can spend the money on the Vitamix, don't waste it on the Waring. And if you can't get a Vitamix, then get another machine -- even if it takes a few seconds longer to puree, you will be happier with the total experience."
2,carafe does not hold up,"As previous consumers of the Waring Megamix have already identified...the plastic carafe is no match for the blender power. Additionally, the replacement carafe is expensive and also plastic (subject to failure).Bottom line: if this blender had a stainless carafe (or even glass), you may pass it off as a commercial quality. With the cheap plastic carafe, this is a poorly designed home use blender capable of only the lightest jobs (crush ice at the blender's peril)."
3,Doubt you'll see it more than once,"On the one hand, ""Element of Doubt"" is an interesting thriller with good performances that keep you guessing. On the other hand, it's more distasteful than fun -- unlike Hitchcock's ""Suspicion,"" which is obviously its inspiration.It's certainly worth seeing -- once. But what makes subsequent viewings of mysteries enjoyable are other elements (like humor or particularly interesting performances) that compensate for the lack of surprise once you know the plot twists. Unfortunately, you won't find those extra elements here."
3,"It is nice, but not what I expected","The picture of the watch makes it look too small. I had to return the watch. The description said it was a ladies watch, but it was too big.It is not bad, but not my style."
5,The finest popular music recording of the last 50 years.,"This one has it all, jazz, funk, pop, big band, a convergence of a perfect mixture of American popular music and a perfect American fantasy of the 1950's. Evokes memories of smoky Rat Pack parties, Cuban vacations, the red menace, and the vision of a streamlined future, even in those of us born decades to late have them first hand."
5,Very Good!,"When I started listening to the dvd-audio version for the first time it didn't seem that much better at first. So I put the normal cd in my cd player and switched to that one... OK... Now I hear ;-) It *is* good! Very good indeed! Too bad it's kind of a pain to switch my Toshiba player into the dvd-audio mode. But it's worth it. And the video of New Frontier as a bonus, that's so nice.Now I'm just waiting for those rare moments that I have the house to myself so I can pump up the volume and get totally immersed in the sound...When will they bring out all the Steely Dan CDs in DVD-Audio I wonder."
4,Recommended by Pope Benedict XVI?,"I heard about this album from its inclusion on the Vatican's list of favorite pop albums (a comment on the video for ""New Frontier"" on YouTube mentions this too). I knew Donald Fagen was from Steely Dan and I've always liked their song ""Hey 19"" so I thought I'd give this a spin. From reading some of the other comments on here, this seems to be a real audiophile's album, so of course I bought the CD instead of the download (anyway the download doesn't give you any discount over purchasing the individual songs). Well now I've played the CD in my car, and just as another reviewer has said, I do have to turn up the volume a notch. But still it sounds good. Also just like another reviewer has said, turns out that I do know the song ""I.G.Y."" all this time and I didn't realize it! Not bad huh for someone who was only 8 years old when this came out."
4,Donald Fagen is the best,I've been a Steely Dan fan for more years than I care to count. You can't beat the sound of Fagen.
3,Not for big dogs,"This was 1 of 2 ropes I bought at the same time. I have an American Staffordshire, 50lbs and she tore this rope up like dental floss. I've owned other ropes before and they took her much longer to tear up. She was able to loosen up the knots quickly and strands were everywhere. I would not recommend this if you have a dog that's a stronger chewer."
1,Not a puppet,"Disappointed that it wasn't a puppet toy like the name says. We got a large rabbit shaped toy that was to big for our dachshund, but we were able to give it my parents lab who seemed to enjoy it."
1,Not enough info,Worthless description of product.- what are the dimensions?- how long will it hold a charge in the trunk of my car? (some last only a couple of weeks some are supposed to last for 3 months)Someone needs to make one of these that trickle charges from the car's battery so the backup is always fully charged.
2,Not Reliable,I bought this at Walmart. It wouldn't charge completely after 2 months. I returned it and was able to exchange it for another one. That one wouldn't start my Ford F150. It barely started my 2001 Subaru. Now it won't charge completely even if I leave it plugged in for hours. My local Walmart doesn't even stock it any more. They probably got tired of the number of returns. Save your money. Get another brand.
2,B&D VEC010BD Start It 300Amp Jump Starter,"Disappointed: I have owned one of these for the past 10 years. What I found in the newer version is that although it is now more expensive, the quality has been reduced drastically. The clamps are smaller & cheaper material and the remote power outlet has been removed. I used it for running things like: 12 Volt impact wrench, air pump and even a digital messagenger sign along with Jump starting my boat or antique autos. The 12 Volt products could plug into a cigarett lighter or the (removed) remote power outlet. Basically I took the battery out of this one and put it into my old Black & Decker Jump Starter, trashing the rest of this container, cables & clamps. Battery now works great in Old Unit."
2,Worked once then died,"I used this product once to jump start my car after charging it the required initial period. I needed it again but it was dead. I charged it fully and tried to use it again a week later. No juice. The battery doesn't hold a charge.Unfortunately this item cannot be returned. Don't waste your money, buy something of higher quality."
5,A spirited intro. to Scottish folk music,"This album is enjoyable for both parent and child. Songs for marching, singing along, and simply listening quietly are included. Many of the standard tunes my grandmother sang to me are included on this album. I have enjoyed sharing them with my daughter and learning new ones. A great piece of Scottish heritage to share with your children."
3,"Good FM, Bad AM, Overall slightly disapointing","Why can't anyone make a good solid, old-school, transistor radio anymore? I wanted a nice handheld radio for ball games and listening to at my desk at work. I mostly wanted it for AM, and thus I'm disapointed in the reception and overall sound quality. I have a number of older transistors from the 70's and early 80's, and the quality of the older radios were so much better. The older ones are solid, have rich sounding speakers and have just an overall nice feel. Radios today are cheap, flimsy and have an ""echo-ee"" kind of sound. I guess I'll just have to stick to the oldies, but goodies. On the positive side, the FM reception seemed to be ok. I also liked the color scheme and the look of the design, just not the feel of the materials. ... so if you just want a little radio for listening to around the house, or wherever, then maybe you'll like it. I like the little ""swing arm"" handle, that is kinda cool."
3,Clunky but useful.,"I've been using this for my certification tests, and I think it is a useful product. It is a bit clunky and took a minute or two to get things rolling once I started the app. I think the price is too high for it, so if you can get it discounted somewhere go for it."
1,Annoying,Monster annoying music. One thing I like to do is run to the beat. You'd have to be the six million dollar man to run to this beat. Way too fast.
4,I liked the bag.,The bag is nice but the picture provided makes the bag look a little bit more sturdier. It was a good gift for the price though.
2,"Looks Nice, but Information Is Not Helpful","I tried this directory along with my Writer's Market. Herman's book looks really nice, but when I compared the two, I realized that Herman's is almost all fluff--especially in the listings. Plus, Herman's guide has less book publisher and agent listings, and absolutely no magazine listings.It did have some interesting stuff in there, but is only worth buying if it is used as a supplement to Writer's Market. And definitely pay attention to the title, because this will only help you if you want to get a book published."
5,Writers?,"I know that writers are rarely editors, but just reading these reviews made my stomach turn! Is it possible that nearly every ""writer"" who has griped about this book for its inaccuracies has little or no ability in the spelling and grammar departments? Could it be that many of you have had little hope in the publishing world because - gasp! - you're not able to write well??"
4,Postmodernism without the weird stuff,"This is one of the most accessible books on postmodernism (PM) available. While other authors become almost unintelligible when discussing PM, this fellow remains clear and fairly concise. For those that are new to the concepts of PM or are especially interested the philosophies and philosophers of modernism and PM, this is an excellent book. The early chapters lay down the groundwork for some well-considered conclusions towards the middle and end of the book.The features of the book that I thought could have been better were the rather slow build-up of the story, and lack of connections to PM art, film and architecture. Nevertheless, a great book on a tricky subject."
1,"317 pages of text, maybe 50 pages of content","Winifred Gallagher swings between extreme level of detail in mundane details - for example ""One day, we have coffee in the Hungarian Pastry Shop, a hallowed sanctuary of West Side artists and academics that's just across the street from the cathedral"" to simultaneously skimming over all but the most superficial details of any of the faiths she surveys. Self indulgent, she comes across clearly in her own words as a ""bumbling dilettante"". Her writing and analysis is based on her own limited experience, brief forays into the faiths she explores and interview quotes. She seems more interested in capturing the superficial details surrounding these conversations rather than understanding the complexities of religious thought expressed."
2,Timid and sadly ignorant,"What a disappointment. Another in a long line of ""esoteric"" spirituality ""discover, explore, get in touch"" books, aptly written in the jargon of 1990s American urban professionals. Buys into a body-spirit dualism that, in the name of ""authentic spirituality"", allows us to do anything we want with matter - a moral slippery slope. Ultimately a timid book, afraid to embrace the radical consequences of adopting a religion that makes real demands on overcoming the limitations of one's little self. Sadly ignorant of history (ie the experience of others before us). Will not satisfy even the neoagnostic searchers who hunger for Truth."
3,The other one is better!,I like the other CD better - the original soundtrack with all the vocals fromt he movie. It's a much more wholistic experience. I like that is is more undustrial - the way the movie is. It's sexy and entertaining.I recommend the original!
1,Insipid version of the original,"If Richard Stilgoe or Barry Manilow were to perform their 'easy-listening' interpretation of Vangelis' stunning soundtrack - this would be it! Imagine you were on a cruise and the slick-haired, tux wearing piano player in the lounge asked for requests. You pipe up with ""How about Memories of Green?"". He says ""Okay, but hey - why don't we lighten it up a little for all the couples out there, (cheesy smile) you know, give it a kinda laid back New York jazz feel. Can you dig that?"" This bilge is what he and his orchestra would come out with.Jazz is music to relax to.Vangelis is music to watch 'attack ships on fire off the shoulder of Orion' to.If you have a profound religious experience - complete with music - chances are that music will be by Vangelis, Thomas Newman or Mahler - NOT the New American Orchestra! Nuff said."
3,HMMM... A MIXED BAG OF COVER SELECTIONS,"Well, we put up with this one because it was the only thing available for over ten years since Vangelis withheld his original tapes from Warners for release in '82 upon the film's release (he felt his music had saturated the market pursuant to 'Chariots').The best one can say is that the 'Love Theme', as rendered by saxman Tom Scott, rates up there with his cover of 'Theme from Taxi Driver', and Chuck Findley's trumpet on 'Blade Runner Blues' does have its charms (but it by no means achieves the timeless bliss of the original synth version ). The version here of 'Memories of Green' is rather leaden."
1,after a few prints it started smearing and has ever since,after a few prints it has started smearing and has ever since!!! I don't think I would purchase again!! thanks
3,"Pretty good, but nothing special","It's got good graphics and pretty good control, but repititive gameplay. My biggest complaint is that Salem is pretty useless other than the destroy cat blocks thing."
1,not that good,i got this game at age 10 and i finish this game in one day its very easy and not worth spending money on to play it only a day. if you have someone very young like 6 or 7 years old then they may play it longer but anyone over 8 will probably finish it in a short period of time.
4,To Grandmothers house we go....,"Being an avid fan of QOTSA I was rather excited to listen to this album and watch the DVD because of the great track listing. Overall everything is awesome, with one exception, I have a really hard time enjoying it only because Joey Castillo is going at a little bit of a faster tempo than the songs originally should be at, to me it's very noticeable and it drive me nuts! I just want to yell at him sloooow down a little and it will be perfect. That is the only reason why I did not give it five stars. Other than that this set is awesome, great DVD to watch with lots of great extras and great cameo's as well. And the album is a great summer album, makes you wanna be gettin with the love! Oh one more thing...Nick Oliveri needs to be back in the band again, that guy is SICK(Sick as in really really good)!!!"
5,Delightful childrens tale of a problem solving witch.,"Wittilda the Witch needs to provide for her 47 cats. She seeks a job that matches her talents and finally gets a chance to deliver pizzas. Her broom helps beat the competition. However, just when everything is going great she is forced to make a decision that concerns someone in need. The time it takes to rescue a friend, could cost her the pizza delivery job. Excellent illustrations by Mark Buehner, the same talented artist who did the Taxi Dog books. A perfect Halloween favorite."
2,not a good translation,"I always loved this book as a kid, but it seems like someone took this book that had been translated into a non-English language and then translated it back into English. NOT PRETTY!BUY the English original instead"
5,My Favorite Food in the World,"Dominosteine is the best treat ever, and Lambertz makes the absolute best. If you enjoy German desserts and cookies, you MUST try these."
2,Dont get this book,I thought hhhhhmmmmmmm i think i could get into this trading thing after reading a book like this but even this book which is for dummies is too hard to understand sometimes
3,"ok story, but not what you expect from Brooks","Unfortunately Brooks hit a homerun with ""Darkness Bound"". Allthe of his books since have not lived up to it.This is pretty good with lots of plot twists, but does not liveup to his steamy previous novels."
5,Larry Does it Again - With a Twist,"I won't get into the story - Wayne Rogers did a good job of that. Let me just say that Larry Brooks has outdone himself with BAIT AND SWITCH. He takes us on a first class roller coaster ride that we don't want to end. Wolf, the protagonist, is the proverbial king of smartasses - but he's a cute smartass - with a conscience. And, of course, there's that Brooks thing about keeping you hanging until the very last page. There is not a word out of place. The writing is crisp and the sex is hot. I read this book in record time - it was THAT good. Bravo, Larry - we want more!!"
2,Great . . . while it works,"The TiVo service is fantastic, It really makes watching TV and recording shows a pleasure without the hassle of programming a VCR. However, my unit froze up after several months of flawless service. Customer service could not help at all . . . the two service reps sounded like they were 15 year-olds. Ultimately, they told me to send the unit back to the factory (at my expense), along with ... plus local taxes. This is their ""policy"" regarding any malfunctioning unit. even if the problem requires two minutes and no part to repair, the consumer is out ... . That's outrageous! I'm looking into replacing this product with another brand (such as Sony) if the warranty and repair policies are any better."
5,Life Changing,I bought the HDR112 but is the exact same product as the 612. It was the greatest decision I have ever made. There's no buyer's remorse with TiVo. I've had it for 5 months now and I don't know how I ever lived without it.
5,THE PERFECT CHARGER :),"FLIP-DOWN PLUG and Automatic Charging cut-off.The Original from Nikon, use a cable... JAJAJAJAJAJAJAJAJAJAJA!!! THAT IS SO FUNNY... a CABLE. FOR THE LOVE OF GOD!!! :)This one looks like a GOOD Quality PRODUCT."
3,Disappointing,"Of course, the book is titled Understanding and Controlling Stuttering. The first half of the book, the ""understanding"" part of it, is fantastic, and goes into deep detail.The second half, which is supposed to reveal a ""comprehensive new approach"" can be summarized in one sentence: relax your butt hole. I am not making this up!! The author is convinced that relaxing your anus will also relax the same part of your body that is keeping you from breathing and making you stutter.I don't think I have to tell you that his suggestion is bogus, although his reasoning is somewhat sound. As another reviewer implied , the author molds the entire book around his hypothesis, as if begging you to believe him.This book is pretty good for the ""understanding"" aspect, but the ""controlling"" aspect, read Self Therapy for the Stutterer instead, which has tried-and-true methods of control. For those of you thinking of buying this book to find the miracle to cure your stuttering, this isn't it."
5,fleetwood mac mirage or not mirage,"THIS ALBUM MEAN SO MUCH FOR ME SO IT WAS IMPORTANT TO FIND IT ON : an emergencyI HAD DISCOVERED Fleetwood MAC WITH THE LEGENDARY RUMOURS KNOWN BY ALL FANS (LOVED BY ALL FANS ?)MY SISTERS LISTENED AND RE LISTENED IT, HAVING BOUGHT IT IN SCOTLAND DURING A SCHOLL EXCHANGEi had not my own material to listen music so i depended straightly of my sisters for my musIcal tastes .

1,Great album. Completely AWFUL sound quality.,"I can't add much more to the reviews of the actual music on this album (which is superb), but I think all buyers should be aware of the completely sub-standard mastering that went into this CD release. How it made it past the quality control ears of the band, particularly Mr. Buckingham, is beyond me. My old cassette copy of this album sounds better than this original CD release. DO NOT BUY this CD version. Wait for the re-mastered release which, according to Wikipedia (which, of course, is always dead spot on), should be out sometime in 2011. This album's music deserved better treatment than this disgraceful product. Barely one star."
3,"It's 2011 ! WB ! Re-Master it, Already","I think I speak for millions of FWM fans when I say that...This CD (whatever you may think of it) has the audio quality of a cassette from 1990 !Warner Brothers ? We're not getting any younger, here... This album has amazing sonic potential if you'd just get off of your collective asses and do it...You'll make money, I promise."
5,Great CD,"This CD, like several of their others, is very entertaining. I am proud to listen to it and have it."
1,Too bright,"If you plan to place this Clock Radio within 50 feet of your body, don't buy it. It is too bright, even in the lowest setting."
1,Blue Display TOO Bright,"I bought this CD Clock Radio because I was really impressed with the abundance of features. Unfortunately, the blue display was EXTREMELY bright, even on the dimmest setting. I couldn't get to sleep at night because it lit up the entire room. I returned it."
4,Gentle Awake is great.,"I agree with most other reviewers that the radio reception is excellent, the sound is very good, and the gentle awake feature is a major plus. I also agree that the display is difficult to read at any angle below the clock face, like if it was on a dresser above bed height.The Philips documentation, and their web site, state this unit does not have a headphone jack. The Amazom listing says it does. It Does! It's on the left, and is mistakenly called an AC adapter outlet in the user's manual. The only difference from the less expensive AJ3950 is the digitl tuner with presets. If this isn't important to you, look at the 3950. Overall, I am well pleased with the product, and have learned to live with the display's limited viewing angle."
5,Western Birds,"As someone new to birdwatching I needed to find some good field guides at several points on my recent World Cruise and I bought Peterson's Western Birds to use for my visit to San Francisco. I found this a very impressive book, considering the fact that it covers 700 species in such a small book. The illustrations are excellent and arrows show clearly the distinguishing points to look for with closely related species. They include summer and winter variations, juvenile plumages and birds in flight.It is not a full field guide and does not give details of habitat but it has all the essentials for identification. It is slightly irritating to have the maps in a separate section at the end but this must aid the concise nature of the book.All in all I would recommend it as a handy pocket guide to take in the field, supplemented by an alternative source of fuller details. Even the hardbacked version is fairly portable. Excellent value for money."
5,good book,this is a great book to help anyone learn about western birds and has great photos to help you find different bird species
4,Boids.... billions of boids,"Bought this along with the Sibley guide. I like the illustrations in both but I prefer Sibley's because, thanks to the range maps for each species,you are able to tell if a species resides in your area. With the Peterson book you have to flip to a separate section for this info. I'd like to see a guide that showed more info for fewer species in smaller areas. For instance, I live in Oregon and most of the birds in my Western North America guide are not located here. I'd like to have an Oregon-only or Washington-Oregon-California guide. With fewer species you could have much larger illustrations."
2,Commercial Ibiza Trance...,"I really can't understand all those reviews with 5 stars: this is nowadays typical commercial dance music, the one that you can hear in Ibiza's most popular clubs full of people that don't know anything about dance music but just need a rhythm to move.Plaese note that I got nothing personal against this group (I'm not an user of Soulseek), I just bought the cd after reading on a magazine the story of the peer-2-peer problems they had."
1,Musically unimpressive,"There is absolutely nothing here. This is the kind of technically inferior, cheesy tripe that gives electronic music a bad name. There is nothing original, or innovative on this entire cd - it is mediocre at best. The sheer lack of artistry in this cd leads me to think that this creation was inspired more by revenue than the creative force that drives true artists."
1,Filled up a lot of space.,"What prompted the rave reviews? Cloudsplitter was a difficult book to read, not because of the subject or the length, but because I began to suspect Banks was paid by the word. Every time it appeared that something substantive would be remembered or described, the narrator contradicted himself or amended what he just said. I longed for something definite. I'll write the rest of this review in that style, or perhaps not really, for my forebears, if I may call them such, would have chided me in their particular way (their way being of course thought by them to be the only way) perhaps because of their churchly upbringing, although they weren't religious in the sense in which ""religious"" was used in that time and place, yet perhaps they WERE religious when compared to the modern lack of..."
3,"Way, way, way too long","I'm with the minority of reviewers who found that this book could have been half its length without losing anything. To be sure, there is much to admire about Cloudsplitter, most notably the vivid descriptions of mid-19th century frontier life and its hardships, and Banks' tightly focused description of John Brown's plans for the Harper's Ferry raid near the end of the book, but this novel is far too repetitive and includes a lot of dross. The framing device was also annoying, although it did have the benefit of warning the reader right up front that a lot of dull excess was to follow. Cloudsplitter is a decent book, but on balance it's not really a worthwhile endeavor for the reader unless he or she has both abundant free time and the patience of a mule."
4,Excellent,"As historical fiction goes, Cloudsplitter is as demanding - morally and philosophically - as it is lively and warm. Banks, in this thoroughly meticulous account, delivers you to the life of the radical abolitionist John Brown and to ante-bellum America.Was he a madman? A zealout almost always unwilling to compromise? A man simply too religious for his times? Yes, all of that is true. Above all, though, he was a singular, brave humanitarian who sacrificed everything to battle an evil that sickened him."
5,At last!,"A deep, moral, personal account of when the minorities' rights justify (indeed, require of moral men) that they shed blood to purify a nation.Thank goodness, an account has finally been written which portrays John Brown and his men as real American heroes, thoughtful and brave, who overcome their flaws and take on the greatest evil that humanity has ever known.This is the first novel by Russel Banks I have read. He has the ability to show this kind of courage in context; rather than simply flag-waving or pretending that these men did NOT do unpleasant things when necessary to purify their souls and the soul of a nation."
5,I couldn't sleep. I just kept reading.,"Great book. I wanted it to keep going. I started reading it because John Brown was born here in Torrington, CT now I am pushing for the minor league baseball team here to change their name to The Abolitionists. Their logo should be a picture of John Brown. Maybe I am getting carried away - but read the book."
5,good...excellent,"This product, I presume, is not made for ""pro"". It is a device you buy instead of renting one. Heavy, it break so far what you need to be broken. It arrived here in Honduras perfectly. Except the ""replacement carbon"". One was broken.I will have to destroy a complete concrete house. I count on this ""toy"". It will be next year. Then, I willtell you how much time this tools will last.Few month later....Destroy a 2200 sf concrete roof...made 2 well with parts of rocks, even rent it to a guy who needed it...Ok, now the carbon are ""done"" but eToolcity has them ! Great.With intensive use, please check all nuts, bolts and screw every day at least.Great tool.upgraded to five stars for all the work already done and for eToolcity for their spare parts and quick answer."
1,sent used item sold as new,the case for the jackhammer was smashed jackhammer it's self showed signs of being used before. when I open the case oil was dripping all over. The oil got deep into my carpet and can not be removed. contacted cellar they were very rude and told me that I was lying to them. refuse to do anything about the project and hung up the phone. I would never recommend buying anything from this company they are thieves
1,So much for additional order items delivered promptly,We ordered the spade with the demolition jack hammer in December. No word as when it will be shipped. It was a special deal add on to the jack hammer at little or no additional charge so I guess they just didn't like the idea so are ignoring us. Bad customer service.
3,Interesting,"Quite bleak sometimes and meanings or literary intentions often hard for the Western reader to really grasp, due to unfamiliarity with literary and cultural allusions. Nevertheless a good enough introduction to 20th century Arabic literature and socio-cultural preoccupations."
5,great gift book,"We received this book as a gift when we were expecting our second child. It is a great book for parents to read to very young children who are expecting their first siblings. The only drawback is the dated pictures. If they were updated, it would be flawless!"
5,Love the pictures,"I got this book for my older son when I was pregnant with my second child. He loved it, and it helped him feel very confident about what was going on with all this new family member stuff :)Then, since the pictures are so real and precious, my youngest son ended up enjoying the book too!Any book we look at and discuss over and over again is a winner! This one fits that category easily."
4,Good enough,"I can't say this is the best guide to Jamaica, but it is generally reliable (although the National Museum of Archaeology no longer exists in Port Royal) and more than adequate for most travelers. In fact, it may be suitable particularly for the typical tourist, because it doesn't tell you a lot more than you want to know. It doesn't venture far beyond the usual tourist destinations, but most visitors to Jamaica are probably not into playing anthropologist off the beaten track. I like the type and layout of the book, which make it easy to find things, easy to skim, and easy on the eyes too. But, while it hasn't got as much use as my other guidebooks to Jamaica, the spine is already splitting."
5,Outstanding crosscut blade!,"I use strictly Forrest & Freud saw blades (Forrest WWII on my table saw & the Freud 80-tooth on my miter saw; latter replaced an older Freud blade, 60-tooth). This blade was highly recommended to me on a WW forum (Woodnet) by a number of members, including one who works for Freud (obviously a bias but a wealth of knowledge & detail as to 'why' this is almost a 'perfect' miter blade). The blade has functioned flawlessly and leaves cuts w/ little if any tearout - edges really require no 'touch up' sanding."
5,Required reading for my Academy and GLAD!,"I bought this book cause it is required reading for the Police Academy. Currently on Chapter six and realize how important this book is in this line of work. In the next ten years, i know this is one of the books I will pick up again and refer back to time and time again. I only wish I found it sooner, this book would have been useful for me during my ten years on active duty. If you're serving in the military get yourself a copy to read. I promise you will be able to relate to the first few chapters. A+"
3,If you're a star...you're always going to be a star!,"Watching this thoroughly engrossing 90 minute melodrama is a little like eating a jumbo sized bucket of buttered popcorn. It tastes delicious going down, but leaves you just a little queazy 'cause you know it's really bad!Bette Davis leaves no scenery un-chewed as the faded Oscar winning Margaret Elliot who out-Desmonds Norma Desmond and makes La Crawford seem like Mary Pickford. Sterling Hayden is perfectly cast as her ""Him-bo"" love interest and a gorgeous but gangly Natalie Wood pops up as Bette's daughter. (Look for THE ADDAMS FAMILY's Grandmama, Blossom Rock, in one small scene as a housemaid!) This is almost a spoof, but you can't ever look away thanks to Davis's super committed efforts in the starring role.Lots of fun, in spite of everything (including a shameful sea of boom shadows)! Unfortunately, the DVD offers no commentary track or noteworthy special features."
3,THE STAR,"Love Bette Davis. In fact, favorite actress; however, this movie seems to be an attempt to recreate ALL ABOUT EVE from some two years earlier, in my opinion. Sharp dialogue with a cast of characters, and she looks great! It's the script that promises a lot, then doesn't deliver. She was nominated for an Academy Award for this picture, perhaps in an attempt to claim the one she missed because of the Best Actress/Anne Baxter confusion for 1950 that went to Judy Holliday for, BORN YESTERDAY. If you're a B.D. fan, then it's a must. The impersonator, Charles Pierce, no doubt studied this film closely, not to mention, QUEEN BEE, starring Joan Crawford, for material."
5,Good things keep coming,"Although The Riverdales are one of the Screeching Weasel side bands that have come and gone they are still worth checking out especially if you are a fan of The Ramones. Of all of the SW side bands out there, Squirt Gun, Common Rider, etc., The Riverdales are by far my favorite."
3,Lab color,Too techno a book for me but I am trying to get throught it. Lab as I know it is a powerful tool and I use it frequently. Wasn't expecting such a boring read.
1,still collecting dust,"great ideas, but this book is really dry for me and the organization and presentation is very unappealing."
4,photoshop & photography,"Photoshop LAB color by Dan Margulis is the ultimate book on how to use LAB in photoshop to enhance color in photographs that tend to look dull and are lacking contrast. I enjoyed the first few chapters which were fairly straight forward in the application of LAB. Later chapters however, become very complex and may need to be read several times in order to fully understand the concepts being presented. I would only recommend this book for photoshop users that want to dig much deeper into methods for enhancing photos, and who are willing to wade through the technical explanations offered."
4,Bible study,Great price for my bible study group. Many need the discount price in order to purchase the required study. A wonderful study of the bible.
3,At the Mercy of Strangers : Growing Up on the edge of the Ho,At the Mercy of Strangers : Growing Up on the Edge of the Holocaust was a decent book that displayed the times and feelings of the times during the holocaust fairly well.
3,I should have done more research,"The product itself seems decent, but the tiny tip doesn't heat up enough for my work. It's useless for my needs until I can replace the tip. I largely blame myself for not adequately researching my options. This would not be good for soldering jewelry or stained glass, which is sadly what I bought it for."
2,Too Cheesy,My sweetheart and I love B movies but these look as if someone took a camcorder and shot it. It's corny and unbelievable. There is maybe one okay movie but you have to wade through too much nonsense and boredom. I am a horror lover but these are just silly.
2,Simpleminded and Obvious,"There's no rule that states that each novel must be an original unto itself. Originality is a rare commodity, and rehashing an old theme can sometimes lead to a new insight.Not here.I SHOULD HAVE STAYED HOME may have caused a stir when it was originally published, but it has not aged well. What seemed ground-breaking now seems routine and trite. Certainly, the travails of young hopefuls caught in the web of moral uncertainty that is Hollywood is nothing new.But while HOME may have been the among the first of many, it is too simple-minded to stand the test of time. At most, it is precocious in its innocence. The characters, who are idealistic to a fault, are annoying at best, and never elicit any sympathy for their troubles. If anything, any character who comes across as this stupid makes the reader yearn for more problems, so that the characters will really know what it's like to suffer. The whinings of a young man who can't be a star does not make for entertaining reading."
3,Slow going at first...,"I'm a big proponent of the ""CEO of your own career"" outlook, so I was eager to sink my teeth into this book. What I found were many pages of rather dry theory and not so interesting self-evaluations. I had all but given up on this book when I finally reached the last three or so chapters...good stuff! The chapter entitled ""Running Your Microbusiness"" should be read by any professional person. Those last chapters are more than worth the price of admission! I'd give the first part of the book (at best) two stars...five stars for the last part of the book. My suggestion is to skip the first hundred pages or so."
5,Finkelstein denied tenure,"This is a brilliant book. In a gross miscarriage of justice, DePaul University has denied its author tenure.As the Chronicle of Higher Education says:Mr. Finkelstein's case has excited widespread interest, in part because of the involvement of Alan M. Dershowitz, a professor of law at Harvard University. The two scholars have sparred repeatedly in public. Last fall, Mr. Dershowitz sent members of DePaul's law and political-science faculties what he described as ""a dossier of Norman Finkelstein's most egregious academic sins, and especially his outright lies, misquotations, and distortions."" Earlier Deroswitz had threatened to sue the U.C. press, the academic press that published the book.UC press is one of the most prestigious university presses. Finkelstein's book was peer reviewed. His Department and Dean recommended he be awarded tenure. So much for free speech and academic freedom."
4,good book for anyone,"while i enjoyed the book and agree with alot of what was said, i am sad that the way someone would respond to this book is with an attack on the author. so he doesn't teach at harvard. he teaches at depaul university which is not a community college, it is the largest catholic university in the us( no i am not catholic nor did i go there),and well respected. if you cant rebut what he wrote then dont say anything."
1,NOT Delphi 6 book,NO WebSnap and Web Services technology expalined at all. It is OK for beginners but doesn't cover at all the cool new features of Delphi 6 Web technologies.
1,Delphi for Dumies,"The title off this book must be Delphi for Dummies, or beginners, there are not delphi 6 information like CLX full explanation, webSnap, DataSnap, XML components, and others new features."
3,TIM MCCOY KEEPS PEACE HIS WAY.,"The title refers to the ""dead man's hand"" held by Wild Bill Hickok when he was gunned down during a poker game, and which plays an important part in this limply directed Western that fortunately stars the always poised Tim McCoy, whose piercing glances enfeeble his rivals in his portrayal of ""Gentleman"" Tim Madigan, an unethical gambler whose finer instincts cause him to assist a beleaguered Mexican family near the California/Nevada border. Madigan survives by his wits as he carries no gun and is given some clever lines from the uneven screenplay, that McCoy delivers with aplomb, stealing the acting honors with ease in this rather subdued example of the genre, wherein recovery is the keyword: of pride, honor and property."
5,Transcendent! 80s New Wave at it's best.,"Amazing. Better now than when I first bought it in '83. On cassette. The songwriting, the singing, the guitar, it is absolutely remarkable Roddy Frame was only 17. A prodigious talent."
5,GREAT DEBUT ALBUM,"THIS CD IS A MASTERPIECE OF SONG-WRITING AND PLAYING. RODDY'S PLACE IN MUSIC HISTORY IS SEALED WITHIN THIS DISC. GREAT SONGWRITING + SLICK GUITAR WORK FROM FRAME = AZTEC CAMERA. A LOST CLASSIC THAT ALL MODERN MUSICIANS SHOUD LISTEN TO. ""WALK OUT TO WINTER"" SHOULD BE ON EVERY CHRISTMAS COLLECTION. FIVE AND A 1/2 STARS."
2,This album sounds more like a demo.,"Its got potential in some parts, but I think this band should practice for a little longer before releasing any further records."
4,Excellent! Scary creepy thrash,"Oh ya, sometimes you just hear an album and it hits you just right! That's this album. Very raw sounding but highly recommended. As stated, stand out tracks are ""God"" and ""Slit the Wrist"" but man, the whole thing just slams. Do yourself and a favor and grab it. Love these guys"
3,Looks cool,Unit looks nice withthe chrome ends. Fit and finish quality is good. They do filter better then the streight velo stacks but I still seem to get a good bit of grit and ware on engine internals..
5,-deluxe indeed-,"Being a fan of the Violent Femmes and the know how of Rhino's excellent reissues, I had no hesitation on buying this deluxe edition of the VF's 1st album. Having over 20 unreleased songs, this 2 disc set is one that should be in the collection of any true fan of American Music(no pun intended)."
1,Do NOT read the reviews below,"The reviews all describe, apparently, a different product. If you buy this, you get just the original ten songs -- that's it. No bonus tracks, no ""deluxe."" Nothing extra that would justify the extra freight. Shameful."
4,A right of passage.,"Of all the albums I heard around the time of my late teens and early 20's, this debut from the Violent Femmes was the one that popped up everywhere. It was played by friends, at parties, on radio, and reminds me of many a summer night. I'm not calling it one of my favorite albums, I'm just saying that it was part of my soundtrack to those years, and I know I'm not alone on that. The simple blend of folk and punk, with the right lyrics and delivery, made for something everyone liked. 10 of these 12 songs are classic, and I'm sure some would say it's the one and only essential disc of theirs. Actually, I would direct a newcomer to the recent ""Permanent Record"" collection, and I also love the underrated ""3"" album, but this debut deserves the love it gets, I ""Promise""."
5,What makes this album great. . .,". . .is the fact that these guys are amazing songwriters and instrumentalists. At a glance, I didn't see anyone talking about that here so I felt compelled to bring it up.To some, the tone of this album is a turn-off. But it's just not overproduced. What I love about it is that you can HEAR the instruments as if the band was in the room with you. There are no dramatic arrangements to cloud the water. It is pure music, served without garnish for your enjoyment.This collection of songs will remain in the High Canon of American music for generations to come."
4,Coby DVD-211 is Good enough,"I have been using the product for about a week now and so far it has passed the kids test. There are not too many navigation buttons on the unit itself but the remote is well equipped. It is perfect for what I want, great price and ideal for the kids TV to watch their educational DVD's."
1,UNWATCHABLE,"I bought this DVD with high expectations. However, I found this story badly told, badly photographed, and hardly watchable all the way through--THE FIRST VIEWING! Could not view it twice."
4,Entertaining from Start to Finish,"Before seeing Hanks in this movie, I didn't care for him that much. He really pulls off the role of ""Good Time Charlie Wilson"" in this movie. What really was a surprise to me was what a great job Julia Roberts did in portraying the rich Texas socialite who influenced Wilson. It always seemed to me she was good at ditzy blonde roles and perhaps not much else. She proved otherwise in this movie. Philip Seymour Hoffman's portrayal of Gust Avrakotos was the best and apparently he was nominated for an Academy Award for best supporting actor. The movie really points out that ordinary people, even those with serious character flaws can be true heroes. Charlie Wilson was in large part responsible for the largest covert operation in U.S. history, an operation that eventually led to the defeat of the soviets in Afghanistan."
5,Charlie Wilson's War,We have been searching all over for this movie as it is one of my husbands favorites. The movie arrived in a timely manner and was in perfect condition! Very smooth transaction...no problems or issues with this seller. Very pleased and if you haven't seen this movie I highly recommend it! Tom Hanks awesome as always in his performance.
3,Interesting but slightly flawed,"In this true story, Tom Hanks stars as Charlie Wilson, a Texas congressman/playboy who gets involved in an effort to help Afghanistan protect itself from Soviet invaders during the 1980's. Aided by a wealthy anti-Communist fundraiser (Julia Roberts) and a sarcastic CIA operative (Philip Seymour Hoffman), Charlie defies all odds and somehow manages to orchestrate one of the largest covert operations of all time.The film gives an interesting perspective on a landmark point in U.S. history. Based on what I know about the real Charlie Wilson, I think the movie takes some liberties with the truth, but I suppose that is to be expected. The on-screen banter between Hanks and Hoffman is the best part of the film. Roberts delivers a solid performance as a brassy southern broad, but I think the film could have done a lot more with her character. I'm glad I saw this movie, but thankful that I waited for it to arrive on cable instead of shelling out money in the theatre."
2,Bad Number in a Good Series,"This is a good series that I, generally, highly recommend for its fresh new fiction and offbeat nonfiction writing. But this is not a good number in the series.This collection has two introductions -- never a good sign. Introductions are never really good, and these two, well, reek.Two pieces redeem the collection. ""Big Brother"" is an extraordinary short story that is at once very funny and very sad. It touches on issues of race, sex, parenthood, and carrying on with life in the face of death. It's a terrific story that should have been collected in the year's best stories. The other good piece is David Sedaris' very funny story about his adolescence.Not sure these two stories can justify buying the whole collection, but they certainly won't disappoint."
2,Review for The Best American Nonrequired Reading 2004,"I liked the foreward and the introduction the best. I was disappointed in some of the stories. I believe there were students on the selection panel for the stories, so I was surprised at the language/content in some of the selections."
2,Where are the truly overlooked gems?,"Not here...But, what do you expect from the man who only publishes his friends/lovers? Here, again, you'll find Eggers' friends whose work he's published elsewhere, people Eggers knows at the Onion web site, etc. etc. This is a great idea for a Best American book, but sooner or later, McSweeney's is going to have to stop pretending to publish overlooked, outsider, experimental, or even good, work. Where can one really find that, I wonder..."
5,Underrated,It's kind of sad for two of the reviews. This movie is actually not the worst and I'd really love it if they re-released it. The previous reviews do not do the movie any justice. It's great if you're a great Three Stooges fan.
1,boring,"I've read other books by Russell Banks that I enjoyed. For some reason ""Trailer Park"" was boring to me."
1,Not enough herb,"For therapeutic purposes, one needs at least 400 mg. per day. That's 10 caps of this. I wish I'd noticed the tiny amount of Vitex in this when I bought it. Won't buy it again."
1,Discontinued support?,"It looks like MSN Direct may have discontinued support for this particular watch. They had disabled my watch even though I still had about 9 months left on my account. Then, when I tried to re-add my watch, I lost access to the msn direct website. Now everytime I try to go to the website, with the watch listed on my account, I get an error and it won't let me do anything. If I delete the watch from my account, I can access the site fine. Can't ever get a hold of MSN Direct to find out what's wrong. I wouldn't buy this watch if you want the customization features."
1,Limited usefulness,"This watch has a very limited usefulness. I live in Denver CO area. It doesn't provide very current traffic data, has a relatively short battery life and a relatively difficult to read face. It looked like a great idea when I bought it, but MS and all tech providers are changing rapidly. I'm having a hard time selling it and may just wind up making another contribution to our already overloaded landfills."
1,Stay Away For This Model,"My only reccommendation for this model is stay away from it. Get something different. My second watch in less than a month just died and won't reset.These models are a piece of junk that should never made it to market. I like the MSN Direct technology, but with watches like this I'll not be wasting anymore money on the watches or the service from Microsoft."
3,Timex Easy Reader,"I like the appearance of the watch but after having it continually lose time, I replaced the battery and it still loses time. I expect better of Timex"
2,Linksys Hub,"Very cheaply made, not worth the money. Needed a hub (instead of a switch) due to an Internet Monitoring program that collects information about where our users go on the Internet, this didn't work very well, everything slowed down (since hubs can only do one thing at a time). Will look for an alternative to having to use a hub."
2,I couldn't get it to work in Seattle,It's a World Band radio but I cannot listen to any of the World stations in Seattle. Anybody have any idea why ?
4,Fun Read,"This book was really fun to read. The 16 yr old boy was really funny. It really made me think about the future. I mean, I'm not getting rid of my 3 brothers any time soon, so I probably need to learn how to deal with them. It might be helpful if we can live together for the next 5 yrs at least without always biting each others' heads off."
2,The quality of the film is blurry and in some parts freezes,"The quality of the film is blurry and in some parts freezes, I love this story and I had it in hvs with cc so I thought I will get at least good quality and cc"
5,Rebecca,"A wonderful blending of Daphne du Maurier's book and the Alfred Hitchcock film. Casting was carefully done and quite to my satisfaction. The location (nearby) filming, mood, and music were complimentery to the excellent acting by all involved. Dame Diana Rigg is at her peak, and overshadows all with feelings of foreboding and ultimate hoplessness."
2,Resistance,"In keeping with the title, Your Resistance Must Be Low,in order to buy this recording. She throws in too many third rate songs or compositions, if the latter description really fits."
5,A delight of Owls Is really delightful,"This book tells the story of the author's experiences with many of the African owl species. It is illustrated with many photographs, and contains scientific data as well as many close and personal experiences with owls. It will appeal to any strigiphile!"
5,An absolute rollercoaster of a read!,This book is incredibly well-written and is difficult to put down. A must-read for anyone who enjoys suspenseful stories. Mr. Iles presents a very plausible take on the entire Rudolf Hess situation of World War II and the reasons why several nations felt the need to keep one old man isolated in prison until his death. The book is very long and is all the more powerful for it. This is one story that is worth multiple readings and one I recommend to others
2,off key,"I love every other book he has written. This one is completely different. I may not have liked it because it wasn't what I was expecting, but I could not finish it."
2,Convoluted and way long,"History has a strong appeal to me, and I can suspend credulity as well as the next guy, but this one was really over the top for me. Maybe I should never read an author's first book after reading a later one first. Mortal Fear, Greg's later book, was excellent, even if a bit too long and involved with too many sub-plots. I was happy for Spandau Phoenix to (finally) end. It is as if Greg puts in a lot of research effort and doesn't want any of it to go to waste."
5,outstanding - especially since it was Iles' first thriller,"This terrific book launched Greg Iles as a leading thriller writer. Using the fascinating true story of the Hess mission to England during World War II, the book begins with the death of a prisoner (who was supposed to have been Hess) in Berlin's Spandau Prison. The question of that prisoner's true identity sets the superpowers on edge, culminating in an extravagant neo-Nazi plot engineered by a mega-rich eccentric. There's plenty of equally interesting characters, including a German policeman and an Israeli secret agent. The conclusion could have been better, but getting there is well worth the trip. The historical backdrop is handled nicely, and the pure fictional suspense is hard to match."
1,Comic book without the pictures,"Have the reviews so far been written by the author himself? This is historically accurate and well researched? At the very least, Iles should have used an editor who knows something about the German language and German customs in general. To anyone who is familiar with these and also actually knows some history (not propaganda), this book is nothing but a juvenile attempt at imitating writers who do 'know what they write about' (Michener and Clancy are mentioned). The consistent errors (as opposed to typos) are obnoxious."
2,Highly Overrated - Ignore The Hype,"I am surprised by all the 5 star reviews. I found the book not only to be ridiculously implausible, but poorly executed. The characters are cliched, cardboard cutouts with no nuances and the dialogue is bad b-movie stuff. The author jumps back and forth way too much. There's too much happening, and it's all so melodramatic and poorly executed I just wish it would stop. I just finished Iles' most recent work, ""Blood Memory"" and thought it was very good. I'd wager that the author, if he is honest, is now embarassed by Spandau Phoenix."
3,"Large, Hard to Chew Stew","An alphabet soup of Intelligence and Defence Agencies along with hysterical innocents are pulled into a messy vortex of choppy intrigue. The catalyst is the death of prisoner number 7 - Rudolph Hess. The Deputy Fuhrer's flight to Britain in 1941 continues to be one of the great historical mysteries but Iles disdains sparse subtlety. Instead the author throws in everything and the kitchen sink in his thriller including a cast including an aging female assassin, suave mercenary, Columbo-like intelligence officer, Czarist-zealot, South African General, Cuban pilot, Muammar Gaddafi, Leningrad-siege veteran turned professor, and more. Also references to Munich 72, the Odessa, the Russian Revolution, Guernica, the Six Day War will challenge many readers to keep it all straight. Frankly, all of these ingredients were fun - what was a problem was the length and lack of focus on a plausible Hess deception."
2,What a horrible film!,"This is the worst version I have ever seen of Jane Eyre as of yet. While none of the versions I have seen live up to the beauty of the novel, others have come much closer than this version. I thought the movie was simply dull and boring, lacking passion between the two main characters; passion that needs to be there in order to make the movie successful."
5,Best Jane Eyre film,"William Hurt and Charlotte Gainsborough are well matched in this story of love, heartbreak and forgiveness. Must have if you're a William Hurt fan."
1,Pathetic,"I was expecting great things from this film. The actors are terrific, and the novel has been my favorite since childhood. Wow - was I ever disappointed! This is a pathetic, mutilated version of one of the best novels of all time. If given the choice of staring at a wall or watching this film, I'd take the wall in a heartbeat. If you are even remotely a fan of Charlotte Bronte or her novel, do yourself a favor and rent the 1980's BBC version with Timothy Dalton, instead."
2,Okay For The Most Part,"The actress who plays Jane is quite good, and is certainly PLAIN. The story is interesting or not, as you please. I can't quibble too strongly with this adaptation, except in one major detail.William Hurt's performance as Rochester is one of the weirdest, and worst, ever put on film. He plays the role as if Rochester was afflicted with narcolepsy, and is having an especially hard time staying awake. Hurt's characteristic mumbling and bizarre attempt at an English accent don't help matters much. I don't see what on earth possesses even that poor governess Jane Eyre to find him even at all attractive. Weren't there any hunky stableboys she could be dallying with?There's a far more effective version starring George C. Scott, who is similarly untraditional in his outlook on Rochester but manages through sheer intelligence and acting ability to make it work. Seek out that version for an entertaining and moving version of this story."
3,gorgeous!,"I am not giving it a lot of stars, but I think this DVD is gorgeous. I love the story. I love the acting."
2,Too Short to Do the Book Justice,"Although the movie was well done, because the movie was under 1 1/2 hours, it did not do the book justice at all. There wasn't enough time for character development between Jane and Mr. Rochester so when they said they loved each other, it just didn't seem believable."
3,"Not the best, but very good","I'll start with what impressed me about this. The two girls who played Jane (young and grown) were both perfect for the part visually. The older Jane had a sense of quiet intelligence and a gentle strength that gave her a certain charm. The man playing Rochester did quite a good job as well although it wasn't visually. I loved how he acted it, if only they could place his talent into another body. The scenery was gorgeous, just as I might have imagined it. It adheres to the story MOSTLY (the parts it did tell, that is). The music was astounding as well. Now, for the cons of this movie. First of all, it just simply left out SO MUCH of the story for it to be impactful! It also changed so much after Jane left Rochester to something less dreary than what really happened to her. If you haven't read the book, then this is fun to watch. If you have read the book though, and liked it, this version may insult you. I liked it overall though, it's not boring or corny."
1,A waste of money and a waste of our time!,"Whoever thought of taking a blonde Rochester, blonde blanche Ingram, and a tall Jane was simply out of their minds. and hence, I thought it was very awkward that the fire started right at the moment when Jane left. I think that they were just trying to save money! and the thing that really made it dodgy, was the fact that Jane went to Gateshead. The same, careless mistake was made in the 1944 version *which was, by all means better than this waste of money* probably everyone who likes this hasn't read the book, and thinks it's marvelous! but if you *like me* read the book, and loved it, you too will know that if it didn't have the name JANE EYRE printed on the cover, you wouldn't know what it is"
4,"Read the book, then see the movie","I must admit my eyebrows went up when I saw the pairing for Franco Zeffirelli's ""Jane Eyre"". William Hurt certainly didn't seem a likely Rochester and Charlotte Gainsbourg was an unknown quality. But the pairing works, at least in this version.Zeffirelli emphasizes the dark aspect of Charlotte Bronte's story, an aspect too often neglected. Hurt is obviously a man living with painful thoughts and Gainsbourg has a quiet, strong presence. Zeffirelli might have used more voice-overs; they would have clued the audience in on what the characters were going through. As is is, unless one is familiar with the book, you may have to guess. Another flaw is the ""rushed"" ending; surely the director could have added a few more minutes to tie up all the loose ends and let the viewer enjoy the conclusion.Bottom line on this version is that you'll appreciate its virtues all the more if you've read the book. And why no soundtrack??"
5,Real life and likeable characters,"I love this version of Jane Eyre. The plain-ness of this version makes for a story that is much easier to relate to... and the lack of display don't detract from the romanticism of the movie, but instead make it all the more believable. The acting is excellent and the lead characters are eminently likeable, and while complex people - yet are still easy to sympathize with... I can find little fault with this movie. Definitely a version worth seeing!"
3,This version of the movie isn't as nearly good as the book,This version of Jane Eyre is pretty good. Some of the actors didn't seem fit their roles. An exeption is the girl who portrays Adele. She and Elle Macpherson seem to fit their roles.The movie doesn't really follow the pattern of the book. I think the book is much better than this version of the movie.
4,A movie for movie lovers!,"This is an excellent movie with the exception if you have read the book. The original story was brilliantly written by Charlotte Bronte and was very sweet and a somewhat sad story. The movie, however did not really remain faithful to the book all the way through. The actors were very good, but i wasn't much for their appearances. They did leave out some great scenes from the books, but overall it was a very good film. I would suggest seeing it even though it wasn't a perfect movie. I think even the book readers still might take to it."
1,not worth the time,i am a big fan of Jane Eyre. this movie barely followed the book and didn't even seem like the events could and would possible happen. my advise is to not waste your time watching this movie. if you want to see i good Jane Erye movie watch the one with Timothy Dalton. that one is the best by far.
4,Jane Eyre,Everything about this movie appears to be correct. Jane is neither beautiful nor old. Rochester is not at all but hansome but has a pleasant air to him. The story line is somewhat altered from the original Bronte novel but none the less it tells the story of love between two lonley and hurt people.
5,Jane Eyre,This is by far the best Jane Eyre movie yet. I had to own this classic. My 13 year old Grandaughter was here for a visit this summer. We watched it together and now she has fallen for it too. My husband also agrees that is is very well done. Love it!
3,Jane Eyer with Willian Hurt,"I am an confessed Jane Eyre Jane Austin Junkie. I have all of the version of this story. This is a good one, but not my favorite one. However, I wanted it to fill out my collection.I have yet to see a bad one. I need to get a copy of the Orson Wells version. When I get a moment I will go on line and look for it.Thanks."
1,Jane Eyre Police,"Out of all the Jane Eyre's I have seen, this one is by far the worst, Mr. Rochester showed little emotion, and was too polite, not shady enough. Jane was really rubbish, and they all had French accents!!!!!Please try harder next time,Jane Eyre Police!!"
2,Wrong wrong wrong,"This says it will fit the En-El1 battery, but the charge connectors are not positioned on the front not the side like my digital camera not digital camcorder battery, the labeling on the add was poorly described."
2,Cheap!,"After using this about five times, the black and gold parts came unglued, so that there were some ugly wires and two separate parts. Still functional, but ugly and inconvenient. The whole thing felt pretty fragile."
3,Sounds Like Willie Keith,"There are many interesting insights into Navy life during the two years prior to Pearl Harbor offered by Captain Ruhe. The Neutrality Patrol was something I had just heard of before and found very interesting.It is too bad that Ruhe couldn't get over his grudge toward his CO's ""mis-treatment"" of him. He sounds like Ensign Willie Keith in the ""Caine Mutiny"" and his relationship with LCDR DeVries. You would think that 50 years would take the edge off some hard feelings. It is interesting that Ruhe waited so long to write and p;ublish his books; did he want to make sure everybody he slammed had died?"
3,Trashy fun.,"According to another reviewer, all the stories in this book are true. If that is the case, they did not happen over the course of one month as it seems to indicate in this book.Focusing on three spoiled brats, this book is about sex and drugs and sex and drugs and suicide and more sex and more drugs. Fashionably bisexual, into all the cool music and all the cool drugs, these people have lives devoid of any meaning or introspection. Which makes the whole ""character speaks for himself in the first person"" aspect of the book utterly fascinating.Toward the end of the book it gets kind of boring and you know you are reading about the people who were getting laid and getting stoned as opposed to you who was worrying about schoolwork or something mundane like that, but this book ranks up with Valley of the Dolls and Fanny Hill as one of the great trashy books of all time."
2,I wanted to like this so badly,"This was a tough one for me, I wanted to like this so badly and gave it multiple chances but honestly I just couldn't finish the book. It's just terribly difficult to follow from one chapter to the next when the focus shifts from one character to the next. I really liked the movie and thought the book would be great but sadly its one of the few times where I actually liked the movie better than the book. Where the movie benefits from the unique story, the book struggles with it as it just makes it too difficult to follow."
4,Modern Fiction Classic,"Having read both American Psycho and Less Than Zero, I picked up Rules of Attraction and began reading it with great enthusiasm. It has the same feel as Less Than Zero, but with an ""east coast"" twist. The beaches are replaced with endless dorm parties, and small town hot spots. The book clearly illustrates how the children of the eighties lived in a world devoid of true emotion and love. Their obsessions are nothing more than material desires which occupy their time. Their self centered view points blinds them to what is going on in their lover's minds. This book is a testament to the death of romance, which has been replaced with lust and obsession"
2,a mediocre effort,"I am no big fan of bratpack novels, but I have to say that I usually find B.E.E compelling. Sadly this was not the case with this attempt. There is too much focus on the more sordid aspects of College life and not enough plot to make it readable, and the narrative style is stuttering at best. I would recommend Glamorama or Less than Zero as better B.E.E efforts."
2,"Sean Bateman, the lesser","Bret Easton Ellis has basically written the same book about four or five times, but this is the weakest one, I think. It would be American Psycho where he would take the flat, affect-less ramblings of decadent young characters and run with it most convincingly.About a group of decadent, drugged, boozed, rather dim college students and their various sexual, drug, booze, and other escapades. Told from several points of view, all of the characters are like the appalling background characters of Less Than Zero brought up front. It begins to wear down after a while, especially with the shifting povs.If you like Ellis, definitely recommended. It would take a few more years for some kind of massive depression to set in to write American Psycho, or whatever he was going through, because it gets dark. Rules certainly sold a few more copies with a film version recently--but honestly, of all the good books out there...they option this?"
3,An intersting Story,"This book had a intersting story and good characters, but the author lacks something as a matured writer. The grammer errors were terrible and I belive that the editor should have fixed this problem! Starting each sentence in a paragraph with the word ""he"" was just as distracting as the countless (and pointless) to-be verbs.Also, the anti-human babblings was just as annoying as the grammer. Just like the ""furry"" genre, he goes on saying how bad the humans are when the hybrid cat people are just as human as them. . . probably worse. Though I usually sympathise with the cat-people in these kind of novels, I just couldn't in this one and I couldn't hate the humans either."
1,people of color beware,"I read the first book in this series, and it seems pretty clear the writer didn't have us in mind as an audience. He relies on well worn racial stereotypes of blacks and latinos. Plus Japanese folks are usually refered to as ""Japs"". I guess Swann figured he wouldn't be able to get away with using words like ""nigger"" or ""spic"", so he had to be a little more subtle (though not much) with those groups. Very odd considering my initial impression was that he was using the concept of the moreus, in part at least, as a way of criticizing racism. Disappointing."
5,"Great Sci-Fi Novel and Good Concept of a ""Moreau"" Future","This is the first time I have read any of the ""Moreau"" series by S. Andrew Swann, and I was duly impressed. Nohar Rajasthan is a noble and quixotic character, for I think he is only trying to survive a world where moreaus are only considered 2nd-class citizens by the very beings that created them: humans. The situation that Nohar finds himself in and the subsequent discovery of his ""mule"" son Manuel is filled with believable tension. The ending is great too, and I hope to read more of Swann's ""Moreau"" books in the future."
5,Move over No Doubt,"Paramore is the next generation No Doubt. From Hayley's passionate vocals to the band's rockin' capabilities, this is the next hot group in rock. Each song on this CD is worth listening to, I don't skip any. My fave tracks are Misery Business and Crushcrushcrush. This CD is worth the money if you're debating this over anything else!"
5,Wow..surprisingly good,"This CD was actually recommended to me by a friend and I'm an eclectic music listener..if you look at my ipod..my music tastes range from Red Hot Chili Peppers, Interpol, Nirvana, Radiohead, to Usher, Kanye West..to Faith Hill and Leanne Rimes, Rachael Yamagata and Sara Bareilles. Needless to say, I'm not a music snob and I know what I like..and Paramore tops my list! I love every song in this CD!"
4,"Not the best, but very good.","Paramore's sophomore album is definitely worth buying. It isn't as great as all my friends said it was, but I liked it a lot. It has a very fast feel, but the songs tend to blend together after a while, so it took a couple of listens for me to really like it. Some of my favorite songs are ""Fences"", ""Misery Business"", and ""For A Pessimist I'm Pretty Optimistic."" They each have strong choruses, verses, EVERYTHING! And I love the lyrics. My least favorites were ""When It Rains"" and ""Let The Flames Begin."" ""When It Rains"" was a slow song, which I love, but it just didn't stick well. And ""Let The Flames Begin"" is basically a crappy version of ""For A Pessimist I'm Pretty Optimistic."" But I still sing along to every song, totally worth it."
5,New Fan,"I just recently seen the video for Crushcrushcrush and the song was catchy. It wasnt until today when i turned on my t.v and seen the vidoe again. This time i got to listen to the whole song and from then on i loved this song. I bought the album and i havent been able to listen to the whole thing cuase itunes and downlaoding in Iraq sucks but i did get to hear two other songs, Pressure, and Emergency. and that prompted me to buy the album.Sorry to say i havent heard their first album. But Riot! will defeinetly be played throughout this deployment. Crush already is blasting through my barracks.Haleys vocals are strong and her voice is beautiful. This band rocks. Those who say this isnt real music apparently does not know what music is. What is real music anyway? The songs have a message in them if you listen to it carefully. That to me is real music. This group can go far in this buisness as long as they stay true to their music and to themselves and to their fans."
3,NO FOR ME,"I bought these sneakers insted of the Adidas Megabounce and i wasnt to happy with this purchase. They were very uncomfortable and i had lots of pain at the end of the day, The only thing good about the, was the fact that they had a cool yellow sole. I DO NOT recommend this sneaker for any occasion."
4,Good shoe for the price.,"Shoe is fairly comfortable, gives excellent support when running and still allows your feet to breathe."
1,Poor Choice for Any But the Simplest Jobs,"This product may work well for a very simple, short and straight vent pipe. But it is ineffetive for a longer pipe with turns/angles. There is too much friction to overcome, no handle to grasp to rotate or push it, and the plastic ""rod"" is so flexible that it just bends under light pressure. I have a 10' pipe with ""turns"" at both ends. I have not been able to get past the turns, which are about 1' to 2' from each pipe end. Although I did not purchase this product at Amazon, I am returning it today."
4,great transmitter IF you use batteries,"I bought this to play audio books while on a long trip. For the first few minutes, we experienced lots of interference and kept changing stations to avoid it. We were about to abandon it when I decided to try batteries instead of the A/C power. Voila! Rock solid, noise-free audio for the rest of the two-day trip.(I did get some cell-phone ""chatter"", e.g. when receiving calls, but never bothered to see if changing stations would eliminate that. There's no telling which component was passing on that noise, but it wasn't a big deal.)"
4,Nice Melodic Punk,This is a very good melodic punk album with a quick pace and nice vocals. The female back up vocals are very nice too.(She's Pretty!) Recommended to fans of fast melodic punk rawk.
5,Beautiful!,"I've had this beautiful book for awhile, seeking it out after reading it a friend's home. The illustrations are exquisite and the story is sweet. I recently purchased for a client whose beloved dog had passed away. She, too, seemed impressed."
3,A good flick.,"Racing with the Moon is a good film, and it's a lot of fun seeing a young Sean Penn & Nick Cage (among others). Ultimately, however, the film is uninspiring."
2,A Manual of Fingerweaving,"For the average person who wants to learn the basics of fingerweaving, I suggest getting another book. This one has some interesting old photos and pays homage to the weavers of the past, but the actual instructions on the weaving techniques are not nearly clear enough. Trying to weave a belt on a first try would be far too daunting.In comparison, the book FINGERWEAVING BASICS by Gerald Findley (ISBN NO. 1-929572-0805) has extremely clear diagrams beginning with the easiest pattern and moving through the more complicated ones. It's not as easy as it looks, so begin with a thick yarn or a good quality, heavy, cotton garden twine that doesn't unravel easily. Practice on some small pieces to get the hang of it. Then use acrylic or wool yarns, but avoid fluffy, soft or thin yarns when learning to do this craft."
2,Good movie till the end,"So let me get this straight. Boy is raped by his father, boy falls in love, boy gets raped, boy gets murdered, father goes free. That about sum it up? This movie is totally unsatisfying. The boy never gets to confront his father with what he's done. The mother does nothing until after her son is dead. I mean, what is this? And we don't know what happens to the boy's rapist/murderer either. Does he just go free? Well, at least the ghost of the boy gets to haunt his boyfriend and they live happily ever after. Rubbish."
5,Brilliant Movie,"Simply put, this was a brilliant movie. A gay coming of age story that will have you feeling good, feeling angry, and feeling sad. And the ending may confuse you but it leaves enough to the imagination to turn a tragedy into something happier. Great direction, great actors. Five Stars."
3,dream boy good but hollywood ending crap,the book dream boy was very good. the story of first love was well done.despite the years of abuse nathan could truly love someone. roy was the perfect choice for that first. however the ending not clear enough. NATHAN dies in that house. as he is losing his life he imagines a dream where he is reunited with roy at the end. the movie on the other hand alludes to this but very cryticly-not done right but hollywood dictates happy or happy enough endings in 99% of thier movies. overall the movie is good and still worth watching and buying. matt in stering hts. michigan
3,"Odd ending, which changed my opinion about the film","""Dream boy"" is a drama about love between two teenage boys. Apart from picturing the process of discovering feeling they both share, it also says something about as serious matters as children abuse, homophoby.I have never read the book, so I cannot make any comparison between it and the film.Neverthless, it was the ending that made me change my mind about it. I kept asking myself: what the director had in mind closing it the way he did? Are we still in the same reality or suddenly we are exported to another dimension?I must admit that the last part of the movie was quite creepy. And last minutes only intensified my feeling.I was left longing for more appropriate ending."
3,The actors could have done a better job. Didnt quite get the ending.....can the boyfriend now see dead people? This movie was d,"The actors could have done a better job. Didnt quite get the ending.....can the boyfriend now see dead people? This movie was done alot better than the movie Tan Lines, but not as good as the movie A Beautiful Thing. Over all.....I thought it was a cute movie"
2,Not up to snuff,"I love ECCO shoes, and wear them almost exclusively. I ordered these, and was unhappy with the sizing (the first ECCO shoe I've had dig into my heel - ouch!), and the quality (the sole looked like molded plastic). I didn't know ECCO made thin soled shoes like these - all mine are have special 'shock point' soles that are amazingly comfortable, no matter what you're doing, or for how long! Fortunately, I didn't have any problem returning the shoes to Amazon. And, fortunately, I don't have to give up purchasing ECCOs from Amazon. Now I check the images Amazon helpfully provides for shoppers, to see if the shoes I'm considering have the shock-point soles or not, before I order."
4,Grasping God's Word,Purchased book for an online course. The book proved to be a tremendous help. I would recommend it to anyone interested in learning how to dig into God's word.
2,Ruth,"I got the fan with the wrong size lamp cover, and though they promised to send me one,in June, I am still waiting.The fan is working well, but the customer service sucks.Westinghouse 78108 30-Inch Petite Hugger Ceiling Fan, White"
1,Cheap fan with unfitting glass,"We've had three glass bowls that all broke, 2 during installation and one simply fell out. The fan itself is a bit wobbly and noisy. It's inexpensive, ok to install. For the price it's ok, but for safety it gets a 1 star due to the glass shattering in a million pieces all over the room.."
1,"Nice for a year, then really scary!","I bought this fan from amazon last year and had it professionally installed in october. Last night it blew-up and was sparking and blowing fuses....as I was standing under it at the time it was pretty ""exciting"" to say the least! I guess it really WAS too little to pay for a ceiling fan after all...beware!"
4,30 inch fan,"Not much to say about a fan, it blows air.Its only good for a small space, doesn't cost very much"
2,Watch out for the screws,"The pre-installed screws were so tightly screwed in that we could not get them loose on two of the blades. We ended up stripping the screws in the process, which has never happened to us. Hard to recommend it based on our experience."
1,noisy transformer,"I bought this ceiling fan to replace a noisy Hampton Bay fan in our office. This Westinghouse fan turns out to be even noisier. The transformer has a loud buzz noise, if one uses the fan."
2,"good knives, terrible block","I agree with the other reviewer that had issues with the block. Mine stayed functional for some time, but it was always rather awkward as far as the space it occupied, and then the two blocks collapsed on each other as the ""struts"" came loose from the blocks. The knives themselves I would rate 4-5 stars if I could do so separately."
1,WHAT IS THIS STUFF!!???!!,"All I wanted was an adhesive to attach my new tub surround to the stinkin wall! So my trusty friends at Menards gave me everything I needed including this ""glue"".WHAT THE HECK is it??!!! I agree with the previous post this is not tacky, it's not sticky it's like caulk!! I thought perhaps they sold me something that was out of date perhaps old. Thank God for the previous post who informed me that yes this is the consistency of this adhesive.I couldn't believe it, to the touch it springs back like a rubber band for cryin out loud!! How is this stuff supposed to stick to anything!??I came online I read the reviews is going back to Menards.... I'm going to buy some liquid nails!As a female do it yourselfer I tell you this stuff is the WORST!!!"
1,Loctite NO GRAB Power Grab Non adhesive,I tried to glue a thin strip of pine to particle board. It fell off immediately.I then put 4 c clamps on the 2 foot section and following advice of other reviewers I'll wait 48 hours for it to set and hope for the best. No where on the label is a 48 hour set time mentioned.This delayed job completion a full day compared to any of the sticky construction adhesives that I've used and will use to complete this project. I tried this product because I thought that Loctite products were the gold standard.
4,Ferrari Dino,If your a fan of the 6 cylinder Ferrari powered cars this is a great book and not terribly expensive. Well worth the time and trouble to acquire. Well illustrated and enjoyable just to browse or for in depth read.
2,Modern versions of the old songs.,"I was very disappointed to find many of the songs remixed. I bought this CD for nostalgic purposes. It was very aggravating to hear the old songs adulterated with modern tastes. I didn't care much for the remixed style either. The overdone echo effect on some songs like ""Funky Little Beat"" were very annoying and some were really drawn out to the point of being boring. I bought the CD because my old tape version of the same album finally gave out. If you want to hear the songs like they were, buy the 1989 version of this CD. I wish I did. I wasted my money on this one."
3,Wrong item rec'd,you sent 450watt instead of 600 watt ordered. i am using it for now but it may not last long
3,Not Gardner's Best,"I've read four of Gardner's other Bond novels and they are usually quite good. This one just felt different all around, and it left me disappointed overall. As some of the other reviewers have mentioned, (Possible Spoiler) there was a LOT of double and triple-crosses going on, and by the end of the book it was just getting to be too much, even for a Bond novel. On top of that, Gardner seems to get overly descriptive in everything he explains in this book: the exact clothes the characters are wearing, every little detail about the enemy installation, etc. and it really dragged down the pace at times. By the end of the book I found myself wanting to finish it just to be done with it, rather than wanting to know how it ended.So, this wasn't a bad book, just not one of Gardner's most solid efforts, IMO. Just be ready for it to drag a bit."
2,Not so good,"So, as other reviewers said this paci holder is like a stuffed animal ... without the stuffing. It's very flimsy and it definitely not meant to keep the pacifies in the baby's mouth (for that purpose I would suggest the Wubbanubhttp://www.amazon.com/Wubbanub-Infant-Plush-Toy-Pacifier/dp/B0028IDXDS/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1358790060&sr=8-2&keywords=wannanub) if that was meant to hold te paci in place, it totally fails - anyway, my LO may like to hold this ""buddy"" but the pacifier always falls off ... Unfortunately it did not work for me."
1,It actually deserves NO STARS,"This is the biggest waste of money I've ever seen... every time I went to select a piece of clipart, it forced me to try and download it from the web... and most of the time, the site wasn't even available. If it wasn't a gift, I would have sent it back."
2,Bunnymen go 'mainstream'?,"After souring to dizzying heights with their first four albums (a feat achieved by only a handful of bands) the inevitable fall seems to have come on this disc. The Bunnymen built their reputation on moody, psychedelic concept pieces that culminated in Ocean Rain. For this release the band moves into more 'mainstream' territory, eschewing album-wide cohesiveness for a more radio friendly approach. Unfortunately these lightweight songs don't work as well as the tantalizingly obscure sound they abandoned. If you're new to the Bunnymen you're probably better served by checking out their first four albums (Crocodiles, Heaven Up Here, Porcupine and Ocean Rain) or skipping forward to their more recent efforts Evergreen and Flowers."
1,Not good,"I bought this fountain for a friend's wedding shower. The day of, we set it up and lo and behold it didn't work at all. We had to let the chocolate sit in the bottom since the motor was shot out of the box. I really regretted not spending a little bit more and having a working item. It was really upsetting."
2,Not very well made...,"... after just a few times using this, it ripped. It is not very well made or durable."
5,"GREAT BOOK, GREAT CONCEPT!!!","This is a great book! Although I see the point of some of the readers who say it is a bit simplistic, it is actually a very simple principle that most of us -- in our desire to have it (or at least eat it) all have abandoned -- PORTIONS DO COUNT!! After reading through the book I was amazed at how flexible my concept of serving sizes had become -- we are all going through the ""supersizing of America"" and this book is one way to stop ourselves from getting oversized along with it! It is common sense really, and that is refreshing in a diet book. I would recommend that anyone using this book also familiarize themselves with a calorie counting guide (a great on-line one is available at cyberdiet.com -- check out the fast food portion and despair!!) and a food scale. Best of luck to everyone -- I have lost ten pounds so far and honestly have not felt at all deprived!! 40 to go . . ."
5,Portion Savvy: The 30-Day Smart Plan...,"My physician husband recently used this book to achieve a 30 lb weight loss in 3 months. This is what he called ""Something they never taught me in medical school"". We never tried any dieting plan or read any diet books, so we can not really compare this book to others. One thing we do know is the priciples outlined in this book do work. We are lucky to read Wiatt's book as the very first and perhaps the very last diet book we will ever need. It is really about life long behavior change. Highly recommended."
5,Smart approach to managing your eating habits,Portion Savvy is one of the most important books that I have read. It is important because it caused me to think about ways to control my eating and how to bring discipline into my life. I no longer think that food has to be plentiful to be filling. And I now know that it is important to manage what and how much I put on my plate and in my mouth in order to lose weight.
4,Fair and thorough presentation of his White House years,"Having read a biography on each prez up to Carter, I was a little disappointed to find this book as the best reference on Carter the President. I had hoped for a well written book on his whole life, but since it's not over yet... The author seems to present the subject in an objective fashion. At times I felt he was trying hard to make Carter look better than he was, but the subject just wouldn't allow it. In the end, I didn't feel any better about Carter's term - just justified in my disapointment with his abilities as a leader. I can now say that I respect him as a man, but not as a President."
1,Horrible,"Horrible packanging, Noticed yellow strips on screen; they got worse if i moved the sli ribbon just a bit. I thought it may be the orientation of the ribbon (NO INSTRUCTIONS) Flipped over, tried again. I'm not sure if this ribbon fried my SLI terminals or what but, now the screen is totally green. AMAZON, i believe it is clear this is a defective and poorly manufactured product, take these people off the approved suppliers list if you have one, they obviously don't have any means of testing each unit. I want my money back or a credit towards an SLI bridge from another supplier. Thank you."
3,Good thing they're cheap,"The bridge works as intended.... for about a month. I burn through these monthly, using 2 Nvidia 8800GTX video cards, and after about a month, the screen flickers badly, and I have to replace the strip."
3,it was ok,I received this not so late. They are not so bad. The only issue of mine is that the color was different from the picture. It was all yellow. I wanted to get rainbow colors.. no homo
5,Madonna and Antonio are wonderful together!,"I must admit, the first time I saw Evita, I wasn't real impressed. After the second time, I was mesmerized! I have seen Evita at least three dozen times and know all the songs by heart. Madonna proves she has a truly gifted voice. Even Antonio has a decent voice. Truly, a great movie and definitely worth seeing over and over again!"
4,Great Music,It was an enjoyable movie and it told a good story. The music was what made the movie. I think Madonna did an excellent job as well as Antonio Banderas. I would like to see other movies by Andrew Lloyd Webber if possible. I already have Phantom of the Opera.
1,disapointed,i was verry disapointed to see this movie because i wanted to see the real movie and not a musical movie.i'm still looking for the real real movie but still can't find it
2,Fair,"I take responsibility for not realizing this DVD was in French, I wish there was a clearer area for me to see that it was not in English."
4,Good alternative to stage production,"If you like the stage play, you'll enjoy owning this version. Antonio Banderas surprised me with his singing ability, if he in fact did the singing. Madonna's singing was good but her acting ability was so-so -- nothing to write home about-seemed to be just playing herself."
5,Antonio Banderas' voice is excellent,"Some of the reviews here seem to imply that Antonio Banderas is effective in his role and keeps the film moving well, but not a really good singer. I suggest listening to ""High Flying, Adored"" especially. His voice is excellent in pitch and quality. Antonio is a terrific singer in addition to being smolderingly attractive and a fine actor. This movie is perfectly cast and a total jewel in all ways. Very underrated due, I think, to prejudice against Madonna. I am not especially a Madonna fan but I totally respect and admire her excellent achievement as Evita in this all around first-rate film. Favorite scene: Waltz for Eva and Che. Great chemistry!"
4,A Fan of the Sax,"This CD, compared to Daivd's other ones, is very funky and nice. It keeps you moving, with special rythme in certain songs. Excellant as part of his collection."
4,good video,"just like the original tv series but the beginning freezes. my granddaughter still likes to watch the video. I like the fact that Mr., Rogers actually teaches values."
4,A Classic,"Good rock will never disappear, and I feel that with bands like ""Pretenders"" there is a lot to revive. Once in a while I try to purchase CDs of music of my times, the 80's and 90's, when I had the chance to enjoy music living my life with the energy and brightness of the age and times. Even though in my country, Peru, we have different music-style radio stations in both Spanish and English, I love to collect some classics to keep in my car and listen to when I feel like having a revival. Thanks you guys, I can find any singer or band in any language and style whenever I want to do so. I would really appreciate it if you could send me Ads of music of this kind every other week or so.Warm regards,Bettina Gongora"
3,"Good, but not the same band.","The Pretenders never really recovered from the loss of bassist Pete Farndon and guitarist James Honeyman-Scott. Honeyman-Scott in particular was an original talent who was truly irreplaceable. Hynde and Chambers soldiered on with session musicians and still managed to put out a very good album with Learning to Crawl, but the sound is already becoing more ""classic AOR"", and the intensity, excitement and originality of the first two albums has clearly begun to dissipate. That said, I think this record has stood the test of time fairly well and is not as disappointing in retrospect as it seemed when it was originally released."
5,Great for in-wall installation,"Couldn't be easier to make your own structured wiring installation with these things. Quite literally, one snap and they're in. It takes longer to make the coax cables that go on the other end than to install these. Good stuff!"
1,"You must survive, but I am not going to show you how.","Don't waste your time with this video. All it has are a bunch of people telling you how important it is to prepare to survive. It really never shows you how to do that. The make shift shelter shown in the background of some of the shots is noting but a cheap piece of painters drop plastic hung over a cord. A 10mph wind would rip it to shreds. Not only was it a waste of money, but also a waste of time watching it."
3,Not for use with Flex Fuel vehicles,"Even though Amazon shows this as the proper manifold for the Chevy S-10 with the Flex Fuel option, it is in fact not the proper manifold!! You have been warned."
1,Absolute garbage,"Who makes a movie this bad and still thinks it's worth showing to other people? I've seen better acting in an elementary school play. It was bad enough to be charged $3.99 to rent something this bad, but i couldn't stomach it for more than 15 minutes."
3,I gave as a gift. I received it without any problems or concerns. I have had not feedback from the person I gave it to.,"I did not realize this was a book for young readers, so I hope it is appropriate for the senior citizen I gave it to. THe book was in excellent conditions and the pages and print will be easy to read."
2,Ehhh....,"Passible, I suppose, for a beach read - but far from great. I was ready to stop after the first couple chapters, but pressed on for reasons that still aren't quite clear to me. The clumsy writing style and gratutious descriptions of violence were often a turn-off.Still, it did have a couple points that saved it from being truly forgettable. I did like how the characters (particularly the main antagonist) were not completely black/white. Most had nicely done shades of grey that kept them from being completely stock. And the twists near the end - if clumsily written - were clever.I could sense Mr. DeMott's ambition with this work, but his writing would benefit from being a bit more subtle and a little less purient. But perhaps his target audience would disagree?"
3,Flatpickers Guide,"I'm not too sure what I expected from this volume from a great picker. I suppose I wanted a book that would gradually show the learner how a ""break"" is built up in steps from the melody and tempo of a song. Just outright tabbing guitar solos didn't do it for me.I did read somewhere that Creary was going to produce a book on the Stanleys early songs and the guitar work in their recordings...I'm waiting for that one for sure!!"
2,not the normal swaddlers,"Don't waste your money on these diapers. These are NOT the normal Pampers Swaddlers, which I love. Weirdly, the 1-2 size that arrived at my house were of shoddy quality. These are not as soft, nicely scented, or absorbant as the normal Pampers Swaddlers. They seem to be missing the internal netting. We've had three diaper ""blow outs"" with these and none with the normal Swaddlers. Stick with the normal 1 or 2 size and skip these economy diapers. The quality just isn't the same."
4,Cute and didactic!,"Like the other reviewers, I agree that this book is great for kids to learn more about the disciples as individuals. The artwork is fun, too. The only caveat that I would offer is that the disciples seem to be depicted mostly as white-skinned people with slight tans. It would have been nice had the pictures depicted the disciples a teensy-weensy more realistically. Overall, however, this is a wonderful and enjoyable book for kids to learn about the disciples."
3,Liked washable crayon more,"I bought it for my toddler when we had to fly for 11 hours. It's great when you're in the small space you don't have to worry about staining anything other than the paper. At home, we found it better to use Crayola's washable crayons instead. You can easily wipe and erase when the child draws on tables or walls (maybe not fabric sofas). Because there's no delay in color appearance and it's a lot more cost efficient. But the wonder paper and pen is still great when visiting other people's houses, places or at parties when your toddler needs entertainment but dressed too well to stain."
1,Great idea but disappointing,"I have found with my soon-to-be three-year old grand-daughter is that the markers need to be pressed down harder than she is used to when coloring with normal markers thus her lines are faint. I also agree with those who brought up the delay in colors being seen.... my grand-daughter will remark that the marker is ""broken"" and ""does not work"" because she has yet to put together her actions with the delayed response. This is more so when we color the pre-printed pages and she is trying to color the pictures. She loses interest fast and she loves to color. I'm just going to buy washable markers and we will have our special ""supervised"" coloring-with-marker times."
4,Good for IMGs,Discusses the strategies to pass the three steps of USMLE at one time. contain a chapter in Mnemonics and simulated tests for the three steps.
4,Equally Good,"Although 'Simple Things' is my favorite, this one is pretty good, too, if you like their sound. Consistent level of hooks."
3,Slightly Disappointing,Not much different from Simple Things only not quite as interesting...No new territory covered here.
4,Pretty nice,"It is nice chill music for a drive where you want to ponder life. I was listening to this and got into a car accident, not because of the music though. It really didn't seem fitting to get into a car accident when you are listening to such soulful music. I also recomend Theivery Corporation if you like this style"
3,Zero7,"never heard them before but their brand of music seems very individual and from the soul... i took a chance on ordering and glad i did,, you never know what's coming next so in a way keep you on your toes,, very talented but the wording on some songs could be a bit more pronounced and clear,, i will order again after i use your free preview system first always,,"
5,Awesome Player,"It's about time someone made a player that can use CD-RW's. I change music constantly and prefer CD-RW's because I can erase them and record new music.Have to many CD's from downloading MP3's online just to make CD-R's was getting ridiculous.Though the player isn't really stylish, it get the job done. All the features are great. 20hr battery life, 12sec anti-skip protection and much much more. The price make this the biggest steal of the year.It's a must have portable! Get it now! I already have mind!"
3,MBrew's review- After Dark,"After DarkI recently purchased this CD after seaching for it for 22 years. I loved when I first purchased it as an album in 1987, however either my tastes has changed or the music on this CD is not the same as the ones on the original album. I was a little bit disapointed after listening to it recently, this CD did not have the same vibe it did originally."
4,out of date classic,"The last time I updated this title was way back in 1995. Many trails have indeed changed in the meantime. But in its day (first published in 1987) it was THE book for mountain biking in central Idaho. It's been a classic that helped pioneer mountain bike guidebooks all over the West. Funny, well written, and accurate, with hand-drawn maps that provided charm though, granted, not a high degree of accuracy. That's what the words were for. Photos would have been nice. I tried to get people there and back with a smile and a story. Out of date? Sure. But it doesn't deserve one star because the trails have changed."
4,The new Sam Cooke?,"When he hit the charts, Brenton Wood was hailed as 'the new Sam Cooke' & this singer showed some similarities. However a relatively short run of hits consigned him to the oldies circuit. This cd contains fewer of the hits, although if you like his style that will be no problem. I would recommend this cd for completists & suggest that volume one would be a better starting point for those unfamiliar with Brenton Wood's work."
1,"Attractive Watch, but","Very nice looking watch. However, DOA. My understanding is, I can void the warranty and pay a local jewelry store to change the battery or send it in to Invicta. Sending it in will cost shipping, and the price for the battery, take 4 to 6 weeks, and I may never see my watch again if Invicta happens to ""misplace"" it. So - lovely watch but stupid Invicta repair policy garners this product one star!"
1,another free disappointment,"I think my standards for free books are starting to get higher, because I have not been able to finish the last few I've uploaded. No exception here. Boring and very religious, which is not clear from the simple description."
3,FIREWORKS,"I ENJOYED THE BOOK. LOVED THE SMALL TOWN FOLKSY PEOPLE AND THE WAY THEY SUPPORTED EACH OTHER. OF COURSE, I WOULD HAVE LOVED A BIT OF SEX THROWN IT BUT ALAS! IT WASNT TO BE........WORTH YOUR TIME"
5,one mug?,I have one of these and I love it. It is a really cute quality mug that feels good in the hand. But is this a price for one mug? Or four? You can buy four for about this much on other sites.
1,not level,I am not satisfied with the tool. I tested mine by making a vertical level line on a wall. I then placed the unit on the wall using the self leveling mode. It was way out of plumb!!I had to rotate it at an angle to get it to match the plumbed line. The settings switch is a little dificult to maneuver also.
1,Line bows from center outwards,"Read the review by Eric Angell. I used this product against a wall not a floor. I COMPLETELY understand the difference between the switched modes. After having done many measurements, this thing is way off. My only guess as to why there are some 5 star reviews here is possibly in the manufacturing process. Some may be good and some may suck. Mine sucks to the point of being unusable."
1,Clerical error,"I can't review the product because the write up described the wrong item. I didn't receive what I thought I ordered, but the company was very prompt in issueing a pickup order and a refund."
2,Don't expect that great '70s sound from this one!,"You would think that a new release by Player would be just as fantastic as their 1976 self- titled debut and their Room With a View LP. Guess again! On Lost in Reality, Player takes on a typical '90s adult contemporary sound which I view as a disappointment, especially considering Peter Beckett's true talent."
1,Don't Bother,"This product is cheap cheap cheap and certainly not worth the $4.99 I was charged. Don't bother ordering this as you will certainly want to return it or throw it away, but you definitely won't want to display this in your home or office.Happy New Year and buyer beware."
4,Great (I guess?),It's not the best realy cause its NOT COLOR!Everthing eles is perfect and it makes happy as a 8 year old. It's great for trips!It would not let you down!(But there is a better toy out there you know!
2,Be Very Careful!,"I bought a video now and i really liked it. I was going to california, and i live in wisconsin, and when i went through the metal detector, it broke my video now! I was SOO Mad Because I JUST Bought It!!!!! I travel on planes a lot, so i might just go with a regular portable dvd player. When i had it though, i really enjoyed. So if you go on planes a lot, DO NOT BRING YOUR VIDEO NOW WITH! YOU'LL REGRET IT!"
3,get videonow color its way better,"this toy is very durable, my little sister kept stealing it and dropping it on hard floor and it didn't even get dented and it still worked fine. the thing is the screen is way too small, you have to really look to see, and its in black and white. i just got videonow color instead and its wayyy better!"
2,Broken and very sad little girls,Santa bought two of these for two girls for christmas last year. Both are six years old. The first video now broke the first day. I returned it to Walmart because they are the only ones who do not give a hard time about returns without receipts. My daughter was very happy to have a new unbroken Video Now. She watched for a week and that one broke!!! A month later my other daughters video now broke also. I decided not to replace them and I am not buying the color video nows. I decided to spend a few extra dollars and get the gameboy advanced cartoons instead. Much better and kids are very happy!!!
4,loved it,I absolutely loved this book..... down to the wicked mother in law. Great characters and enjoyable story. I will certainly buy more books by this author.
1,Layout? Just pictures with spare comments,"The description of this book says 'A graphics design guidebook to the inner workings of great layout design"". Decide for yourself if the following representative text (page 86, describing a picture of a tshirt and a menu cover) qualifies:""A table fork and a tuning fork simpley and humorously convey the food and musical offerings at Greene Street, a SoHo cafe.""A guidebook? Inner workings? No wonder there are no pictures of the interior of the book. Not a single line about how to create good layouts. Some work by well-known designers is the only saving grace. Shame on the publisher (Rockport)."
3,title,Okay. This is stupid process and means people are more inclined to put stupid stuff in their reviews...bla bla bla bla
3,"A book for the coffee table, not the temple.","The Grimoire of Armadel is the medieval equivalent of one of those big Sierra Club books -- something to browse through over drinks and canapes, not something to be taken seriously. The ""instructions for use"" are wholly inadequate.The current publication has the illustrations in black and white, but in the original colors it must have been quite attractive. The sigils grow ever more elaborate and flourishing as the book proceeds, becoming a joyously extravagant riot of abstract figures by the end. Were it not for the art, I would give it one star instead of three."
4,Good solid introduction to drumming,I bought this book because I wanted to learn more about writing music for drums and have found it very useful. I am sure someone wishing to learn to play drums would find it a really helpful tool. My only problems are that it could've done with more editing checks to make sure that the text and images matched and made sense.
4,Great Quality,"We have only opened one pack so far. It has a great quality, not sticking, easy to play with. Just make sure after using it, put it in a sealed bag/container and then you can re use it many times.I wish the sealed containers would come with it. I am using a small ziploc to store it."
1,I'm done with my Keurig (again) until they fix the pumps,"I am on my third Keurig. Each one has died due to the pump failing, I'm amazed that a class action lawsuit has not been brought against them yet - I should not have to replace a coffee pot every year! This latest one just died and I refuse to buy another one. Since I use coffee grounds in the My Cup anyway, I will just go back to a regular coffee maker and it will last me for years. Sorry Keurig, but until you make a coffee pot that lasts I won't be buying your products again :("
5,Keurig B60 System,This Keurig system is easy to use and my whole family enjoys the various flavors. I also called keurig customer service with a problem on Friday evening at around 7:00 pm and they called back on Saturday morning and discussed my problem which had already fixed itself.
2,Great! ---- while it still works,"We got our Keurig about13 months ago. We LOVED it! We talked four of our friends into buying it. Sadly, about 2 1/2 weeks ago, it stopped makinga full cup of coffee. Instead, it'd make about half of what it should have and send the rest of the water back into the reservoir. The machine has a one-year warranty; apparently that's all the time it is built to last for. After reading about others' experiences when calling Keurig, we opted to go back to our trusty automatic drip coffee maker. I do not recommend giving this company any of your hard-earned money."
5,Good Product - Great Company,"I rarely review products unless I feel strongly one way or the other about something. A pure selection bias, I realize.Not only is this a nice one-cup coffee maker, but I just have to give kudos to Keurig as a company. Any time a company is manufacturing a product like this, we are kidding ourselves if we don't recognize that there is some small chance for a glitch, malfunction, etc.So, the question to me is not, is this product 100% guaranteed to work correctly...the question is, what does a company do in the rare instance that it does not.A few weeks after I bought my B60, it started to have a slight, sporadic issue that clearly was not something that should have been happening. I placed a call to the company, they put me on the phone with a tech and within 5 minutes she had placed an order to have a new unit shipped to me. You just don't see customer service like that very often these days. The new unit works perfectly. Thank you Keurig."
3,Love it but...,I received this as a gift this Christmas. I absolutely love this coffee that this makes and have no complaints about how it works but I have one issue with it. How much waste are we creating with each cup of coffee. We use these pods once and throw them out! This is awful for the environment! I wish they could come with something a bit more environmentally friendly. Just something to think about.
4,Fantastic!,I've known about Keurig coffe makers for some time but had always been reluctant to buy one as I am very picky about my coffee.I received one as a xmas gift and was pleasantly surprised.Probably the nicest thing about this coffee maker is how quickly it can make a cup of Joe. You go from zero to full cup in about 10 seconds.The Keurig let's you pick from three different sizes which allows you to tailor the strength of your coffee. I really like this feature because I prefer my coffee a bit stronger.The only reason I didn't give the Keurig 5 stars is because the disposable coffee cups are not recyclable.
5,fantabulous,this product was shipped quickly and safely. it was everything i imagined. the ease of using this coffee maker is superb.
5,Best gift ever!,I got this for my husband for Christmas and he seemed less than thrilled with my gift selection until he actually plugged it in and started using it. He loves it so much that he asked me to order one for his mom and now she's hooked! My husband brews a cup in the morning and another one in the afternoon for his long ride home.
5,Elmer 24,I have been researching coffee makers for several months and when they had the special B60 unit on sale with all the different coffees and special filter I purchased it. It has been great!!! If I want to brew my own blend or one of the prepackaged coffee it is fast and simple and a great cup of coffee every time. It is simple to use and when your in a hurry the coffee is ready because of the water container that holds 40 ounces of water. I would not hesitate to go out and purchase this unit if you are looking for a great value.
5,Cheaper at Lowes $119,Great device. Easy to use but cups are pricey. Buy in large groupings or use your own product.Wish it held more water. Make sure you only use filtered water.
1,Not pleased,"I was not at all pleased with the product. First of all, the product arrived with water in the machine and coffee grounds as well. The water reservoir was dirty and appeared not to have been cleaned. The item mentioned in the shipping invoice was what I requested which was a B60 Keurig. What I received was a B40. I sent the product back to the seller via the FedEx label provided by them, requesting a refund for my purchase. I am not likely to use this seller again but instead will order new items of this type directly from Amazon."
1,customer beware,"this isn't about the product but about the price. 2 DAYS after i received my kuerig amazon dropped the price by $13 when i called to complain i was told they would not adjust the price and that's their new policy, what crap!any other retailer would have refunded the difference,especially when they where only matching their own lower price"
1,Keurig....Do Not Buy!!,I received as a Christmas present this year and was trilled. Worked properly one day only! Shuts down most of the times. I unplugged and replugged and sometimes it works. Sometimes need to remove the water tank and put it back on. I believe there is a problem with the pump. Reported to customer service. Promised a call back and it never happened! I do not think they stand behind their product. Buy another brand!!!!
1,Keurig Warranty is Only 1 Year,"I called Keurig Customer Service today and they informed me that they have a ""strict"" 1-year return policy. I am not comfortable with spending $160/year on new coffee machines. I have had my unit for about a year and unfortunately have been battling with it the last few months following their instructions thinking I simply needed to ""de-scale"". It didn't work. I did not use this machine very often (about 1 time per week). I spoke to Julie first, then Carrie and was told that Gail Pregiosi (the escalation manager) would call me, but that never happened. I am very disappointed."
2,Not hot enough,"I'm sorry I wasted my money on this coffee maker. The coffee is only heated to 120 degrees which is not hot enough for me so I have to heat it in the microwave before I can drink it which defeats the purpose of having a ""quick"", single cup of coffee. The pods make the coffee too strong so I have to pour about 1/3 of the coffee out, add water and then heat in the microwave. Might as well make a pot of regular coffee and reheat each cup. Cheaper, less waste, and better tasting. Sure wish I hadn't thrown away the box it came in. I would definately send it back."
2,Not for the normal strength coffee drinker.,"I really want to love this machine... but, it took a lot of K-cups (which are not the cheapest) to get almost the right cup. I find that the different size choices are useless. The strength changes with each size. If you want a normal cup of coffee, strength wise, you must choose the smallest selection. The Keurig customer help line told us to buy the Bold coffees and use a smaller setting to get a decent cup of brew. For the price of each K-cup, and what one would expect from such a pricey machine, I shouldn't have to use for than one K-cup for one cup of coffee. Too weak. It was just a little disappointing.....PS: Lately I've been using espresso for a cup of coffee."
3,Dead after less than a year!,"I loved the idea of this product and the variety which it offered for choices and sizes of coffee poured.That said, it is expensive to keep stocked in coffees, and yesterday, after less than a year, the thing is dead.It is an expensive model and I expected it to last longer than what it did.This is not good.Beware, buyers.Good luck if you get this item.p.s. It is two years since I wrote this review and the Keurig company hasreplaced my unit twice, each time upgrading to the next model and withfree coffee samples. Oddly, the machine has only been used with distilled waterexclusively and maintained per the instructions. However, for the third time, theunit began to short cup. When I called the company, a wonderful operator easilyreplaced my old unit so I can say, the customer service is wonderful.Now, if only the coffee maker would last, but what do I have to complain about, I've got a brandnew top of the line Keurig -- again! Maybe three is the charm..."
3,Keurig B60- Dead in a Year,"My B60 died a few days before the year mark. I was having problem with water dispensing and rough running. Then one morning it would not turn on. I called customer service and within in ten minutes, they where shipping me a new unit. I should receive it in 7-10 days and all I have to do is send in the Kcup within 30 days (proof of ownership). Customer service was great, but I wish that I would have just stuck to my old, no bells and whistles coffee maker."
3,What;s the deal?,What's the deal with this machine? I just received mine and made a cup and it is sooooooooooooo loud. It vibrates to the point of dislodging the cup. Perhaps mine is a lemon?LAB
2,Eh...,The item I got doesn't select the cup size appropriately. Very disappointed in the seller's description not mentioning that it didn't work properly.
1,stopped working after 3 months,piece of crap stoped working after 3 months. When I contacted manufacturer they basically said oh well. What a waste of money
1,Disappointed,It will refuse to brew coffee just within 2 months of purchase and less than 30 brews in total. Opened up a ticket online since almost a week and have received nothing but the automated response. I have taken two videos of the machine not brewing even a single drop of water on two back to back attempts. I will post it here is I dont hear anything back from the support team soon.
1,Avoid if you like the taste of coffee,"I've tried the cups, all varieties, the basket where you put your own coffee in, different quantities, cup sizes, and cannot get a cup that tastes as good as my old $25 Mr. Coffee. This product is by far the biggest gimmick since bottled water."
4,Good coffee maker,"I recently purchased this particular coffee maker and do like it. It's quick and it's quiet.One issue is the temperature, although set for 192 F for the water, according to manufacturer's instructions, comes out at 160-162F. Makes good coffee but a little hotter would be better.Like the Island Coconut seasonal coffee.All in all, I like the coffee maker."
2,Disappointed,"Just got this coffee maker a few weeks ago and this morning I had a problem where the machine would not start and the window said ""prime"". Went to look in the manual for an explanation but there was no manual. Went to their website for a manual and this model number was not listed. Called customer service and the rep said ""you're right, the manuals are not listed on the website"". He said he would mail me a manual but we will see how that works out. I would expect more from a $150 coffee maker."
1,doesn't last!,"I am very disappointed w/my Keurig B60 special ed. brewer. Only used it for a few months and it just stopped working. I've used filtered water, descaled it at 3 mos, and have properly maintained it. I called the company and all they would say was that it couldn't be fixed; no explanation why. It is not under warranty b/c even though it's been in use under a year, I've owned it just over a year. They just offered me a discount on another one. I told them no thanks, that I will never buy Keurig products again, and am going back to the Farberware that I've had for years. On top of all that it's too expensive. A nice luxury, but not economical in the long run w/the K-cups."
1,Don't buy one of these!,"We bought our first Keurig in November 2009. The first one lasted just over a year. They offered us a ""Deal."" We got another for ""just"" $119. Well, that deal lasted around six (6) months. The next about four (4) and the most current one just two (2) weeks. If you were to model the MTF of these, the reliability model would suggest that these are good for less than five (5) months. If asked Keurig to refund us. Chances of that happening are unknown. My sister-in-law took her third Keurig back to the retail unit and exchanged it for a Cuisinart unit. That was over a year and a half. It still works. Again, do yourself a favor and avoid the Keurig units. They're not reliable. You'll be wasting your money."
1,Taste like prastic,"My husband bought this home a week ago. I was the tester. The unit itself had a strong plastic odor that lingers still. The coffee I tried had a distinct plastic taste to it. My husband didnt seem to mind it but, I did. After a full week of use, the coffees still tastes like plastic. I've tested every variety it came with. Dont waste your milk."
2,Priming Problems,I was expecting a great product with this coffee maker but I am having one problem that is very irritating. About every other time I fill the water reservoir the water will not flow into the unit properly and gives me a priming error. It was just happening when I removed and replaced the reservoir so I started pouring water into it with a cup but now it happens for no reason at all. I use it to make a cup of coffee and when the water starts flowing from the reservoir to the heating area I get a priming error. I found that I have to correct this by lifting the reservoir a little and letting it drop onto the base making the water begin to flow into the unit again. I can't see any defect so I have to assume it's a problem inside the unit.
2,Broke Quickly... and produced rancid drinks,"The machine worked great for a few months, but then the unit starting smelling and any drink we made tasted rancid. I tried to descale it hoping that would work. I cleaned it from top to bottom, but our drinks still tasted awful. We didn't use the machine that much, maybe every few weeks, so it's a problem that it broke down so quickly--especially given the price. I'm hopeful that it was just our machine. I haven't read the other reviews to see if this is a common problem."
1,How can they keep selling these?,"I loved it until it broke, after only 6 months use. It would only make about 1/3 cup, even when I selected large. I cleaned the coffee basket and descaled the machine, as per the instructions. That didn't help. I'm very dissappointed. I will not buy another Keurig. Too many bad reviews like mine. I'll try to find another brand of K-cup maker."
2,Save your money!,"I had my machine 2.5 years and one day it simply wouldn't turn on. I took very good care of my Keurig - and I even ""descaled"" it, because it never stated I needed to and you have to. Not only did I waste $150 on this machine, I was stuck with about 40 KCups to find a home for. This machine is expensive, does not last long, the KCups are expensive AND bad for the environment and you have to use filtered water. This machine is a great idea at first for a single person - but the quality does not hold up. Plus this company is too new - they do not have great customers service nor do they stand behind their product. Certainly ot worth $150 in the long run!"
1,Dont do it,When we got our first one we were very pleased. In fact we ended up buying 5 more and giving them away as wedding presents and an anniversary present. within about 18 mos ours quit working. within the next few months 3 of the other 5 stopped working. i contacted the mfg and with a large amount of hassle they agreed to sell me another one for $100. we have had the second one for about 14 months and now it has stopped working. the mfg does not stand behind the product line if its over a year. Do not buy this product if you want it to work for more than a year!!! Out of the 7 I have purchased in the last 33 months only one still works!!!
5,A great fit for our needs,This unit is a great fit for our needs. I usually grab a cup of coffee to go in the morning and that is it. With this coffee maker I can make my cup and the rest of the pot doesn't sit around and get wasted. The brews taste wonderful and I am very pleased. I also like the fact that it will make hot tea. I like to have a cup every now and again in the evening.
1,Great WHEN it works!,"I am on my 3rd Keurig coffee maker in 3 years. They are not built to last longer than a year. After 1 year of use the coffee maker continually shuts off while warning up, makes incorrect servigs (usually very small)and is slow to brew.I will never purchse another one."
4,Keurig B60,"I just got mine a couple weeks ago. Thankfully I bought several ""variety"" packs from different places because there are so many coffees i've tried that are just too weak even on the smallest size. I like my coffee strong! The French Roast from various places all made a nice tasting cup so I know i'll be buying a full box of that. Flavored coffees have so far come out like flavored warm water, but I have not tried them all from my variety packs so I may get lucky and find a good one. I did like the Timothy's Chai Tea. I just had a cup the Green Mountain Dark Magic which was good but on the smallest setting again. If I want a large cup i suppose I'll have to brew 2 smalls.I like being able to program this one to turn off after an hour or two (or more if you like), and having it turn on for the timeframe i'm getting ready for work and quickly get out the door.Overall I like this coffee maker, i'm just in the new phase of trying to find which coffee i like the best from it."
3,BREWING -add water,"One thing that gets us every time is that it says BREWINGand right under it says ""add water""So you hit brew and walk away, only to come back to BREWING -add water.How does something this dumb get passed all design checks?Other than that, it's fine. It's a Keurig.."
3,"Execution is great, unfortunately the coffee isn't","We really enjoy the convenience of the Keurig, however the coffee just doesn't cut it for me. It tastes weak and watery. We've tried experimenting with different types of K-cups to grinding our own, but with no success. To me, it's a glorified water boiler. If you need something quick and are not picky about your coffee, I would recommend this. For those who enjoy a strong brew, save your money."
5,Great Coffee cup maker,"Wow, talk about a great cup of coffee, it is even better if you like fresh coffee and no waste of coffee beans. It make a great cup of coffee and it has been about one year since I bought it and without one problem. Yep, I have used bottle water and I have yet to to have a bad cup of coffee, love that Donut blend."
4,New One Cup User,I have been using my Keurig B60 for about a month now. I do really like it. I am amazed at how fast you can brew a cup of coffee. You do need to experiment with the different types of K-cups until you find one that suits you. I also like the reusable coffee filter that allows me to use my own coffee.
1,Garbage,"This was a Giftmas present and I've used it about a dozen times (with filtered water only), but now when I turn it on the motor grinds for several minutes and then the dreaded Prime message appears. The first time, unplugging and removing the water reservoir seemed to reset the system but it is now no longer working. I did not have a great customer service experience and will try to return it to the chain store I purchased it in. Failing that I will be tossing this in the dumpster at work."
1,One Year Wonder!,"There seems to be some sort of flaw with this machine.Like many of the other reviews We had ours for just over a year and in that time period the B60 worked wonderfully. The coffee was very good, fast, easy, no mess exactly what we wanted. Then one day it started making a weird noise when it was pumping water to heat it up. That noise lasted about 2 months until all of the sudden it only produced about 3/4 of an inch of coffee at a time. The machine still turns on, functions normally, just won't make more than that 3/4 inch of coffee.I don't think it's a coincidence that everyone has problems around the same time period.Buyer Beware you are probably going to need to buy a new one every year and a half!"
1,A waste of money!,"I got this keurig about 5 months ago and the water pump is already shot. Like other reviews I've recently read about it, I'm only getting partial cups. I'm very disappointed in this product and wouldn't waste my money if I had it to do over again!"
2,Designed to fail,"This is the THIRD one of these that I've had fail immediately after the warranty period. I've used this 3-4 times per week with only bottled water. I've descaled it several times during the year and still haven't had any luck. This one failed two weeks after the warranty period ended.Taking into consideration the failure of these after the warranty period, I believe Keurig has designed them to last just long enough to get past the 12-month warranty. I wish there was a higher quality version. The upgraded and commercial models just seem to be fancier versions with the same unreliable guts.It's a great idea and convienent when it works, but they just can't seem to make them last very long."
2,OVERPRICED,"I bought this after seeing one at my daughter's house.Since she swore by it, I bought one.I have to say - the coffee indeed tastes great.When you want an above average tasting coffee, it is for you.However, I really don't think my B60 is worth the going price.About half that would seem more appropriate. Just my opinionfor what it is worth. Furthermore, mine does not seem to makea constently-sized cup of coffee. During each session, the second cup most always is not as full as the first one, despite the fact that I choose the same size for both. It is off by a good 30%, requiring me to run it again to get a full cup."
1,"Work great, coffee is horrible","The actually coffee maker is nice, and works as intended.That said, the coffee is horrible, in fact I don't think I have had a worst tasting coffee ever. I have tried all the setting and all the different coffee pods, they all taste BAD. That is saying a lot since I had to drink field coffee while in the army. I would almost have to say that instant coffee is better tasting. You are paying a premium price for the single serving capsules, coffee beans from a coffee retailer are almost half the price.If you only care for convenience and not for taste then this product is for you, but if you want something that taste like coffee look else where."
1,Poor taste and amount of effort makes it not worth the money,"We didn't think this product was worth the money. We used it for 2 weeks and tried many different types of k-cups.1) The coffee tasted bland and all the hot chocolate was weak.2) When we drink coffee we drink 4-8 cups.You still have to manually load water in the coffee maker so there it is no ""easier"" than a drip coffee maker.3) The k-cups aren't recycleable so that seems bad.All in all, we think drip coffee tastes better and is less expensive.If the k-cups tasted better then we would not have returned it."
2,Disappointed will not buy another.,"I purchased this Keurig B60 Special Edition Brewing System in May 2010. It functioned as expected for the first 12 months. (Only used on weekends about 5 cups per week). After about twelve months of use (using only filtered or bottled water)and following the manufacturer's cleaning maintenance suggestions it started to malfunction. At first it started to regurgitate the water back into the resevoir and would shut itself off or not come on at all. The display would dim and the set-up menu would appear and freeze up. After following the trouble shooting guide and on-line trouble shooting suggestions it's performance did not improve. Needless to say after reviewing many of the negitive comments (which sound a lot like mine) it is obvious, that to this company it is better business to build and promote an inferior product than to invest in research and development to create a longer lived product. So in a nutshell...they want your money not your satisfaction."
1,"Shuts off, makes 1/2 cups and is slow","I was a raving fan, but now could kick this thing in the trash.. I follow the cleaning instructions to the letter, which in itself is a pain in the butt. But no matter what you do this machine clogs up every month or so and it is sooooo frustrating.Not sure of their newer version have the same problem, but the B60 stinks."
1,Brews half cups frequently,"For whatever reason, this machine started not brewing full cups of coffee in less than a month! I have tried multiple suggesions from various websites to address the problem. You can watch the water go back into the reservoir during the brewing process. Occassionally, it doesn't happen and brew a full cup of coffee. The bottom line is that this machine is supposed to be SIMPLE and I have spent more time trying to ""fix"" it than any customer should. Buyer beware... stay away from this model."
2,Beware ours lasted 8 months before packing up!,"Initially we were very pleased with this coffee maker. Easy to use, looks good etc. After 7 months we started to have intermittent problems with the water pump. It would suddenly seem unable to send water through the k cups and out into the cup. Sometimes it worked and other times it didn't. Eventually it seemed to stop all together. I cleaned it thoroughly and descaled the machine but still it would not work. We thought that was it and that we had been landed with a dud unit. I did a bit of research and found that this issue crops up again and again in customer reviews. We were very disappointed especially when we could not locate our receipt! (we did not purchase this unit from Amazon). I left the unit a couple of days them decided to try it one more time before I threw it out and hey presto it worked! Wait for it, for another 4 weeks and then again stopped again :-( I think this is a case of buyer beware and keep hold of that receipt!"
2,Not For A Coffee Lover -- Not For Me,"The only thing this product has going for it is convenience. Otherwise, it simply doesn't produce a good brew, makes too little of it, is an expensive initial purchase, and is expensive to use.It's awesome to spend 5 seconds setting it, and walk away -- and voila! Coffee! I can see this appealing to many many people -- who don't really care about the quality of the product they drink -- who just want a caffeine fix and end up loading it up with milk and sugar anyways -- who see it as a savings over $3 cup at Starbucks. Can't fault ya there.Not for me, though I can see the appeal. I'm in the boat that would rather spare a full 3 minutes using my Aeropress, or classic drip maker, and brew up a delicious cup I actually enjoy."
1,"Poor quality, does not last long","The Keurig approach to coffee is great. Each cup tastes fresh and it's ready in about a minute. But the quality of the coffee maker is terrible. Mine didn't even last 18 months. And when I called Keurig for assistance they simply said ""sorry"", ""out of warranty"", and ""we would like to sell you a replacement at a slight discount (not free)"". I am sorry, but I can't afford to keep replacing a $150+ coffee maker every 16 months. The coffee by itself is rather expensive. It's ironic that I had to go back to my ""cheap"" drip coffee maker which cost me about $15 10 years ago just so I can have a morning coffee. I would not recommend this product. I will not be replacing my Keurig with a Keurig. If you *must* buy one I recommend buying the cheapest Keurig model you can find. Don't overpay for this cheap quality brewer."
4,Keurig Platinum B70 Home Brewing System,"Being a coffee-holic I contemplated many models, and, after reading so many reviews (thank you to all,) I chose the Platinum B70. It is quiet, no need to put cushioning under it to absorb any noise as it's quieter than a regular coffee maker. The B70 is a newer model with quiet technology and most reviews said the only thing that put them off Keurig was the noise, mine is quiet!! Love it! Love it! Love it! So easy to use, easy to clean, timer is perfect for our schedules, and it also brews iced tea or iced coffee, what that really means is that you put a cup of ice under the small amount of hot water coming out that makes the ""iced"" beverage. Perfect for all in my house :-) I would recommend spending the extra few dollars and getting this model."
1,Do not buy!,My first Keurig only lasted a couple of years when the pump quit. The one I have now is much cheaper made and it is already having major problems after only 4 months. Don't waste your money.
5,had for a year and a half,I have had this brewer for a year and a half. I love that I can make a single cup of coffee every morning with little or no cleanup. It brews very hot coffee. It has worked consistently over this time period. My only complaints are that every once in a while it takes longer to brew or brews a smaller cup. Also I wish the water resivoir was bigger. This brewer is expensive but it is worth it.
5,"This thing is amazing, so easy!","The B60 is awesome. It the easiest way to make premium coffee or tea. Add water, pop in a k-cup or close it empty and add water to your tea, either way its so simple and delicious. Its worth the money."
2,"Easy, but expensive and weak coffee","Very nice to have around, super easy to use! I did not have good luck with the reusable filter because it leaked. The K cups have decent flavor, but get expensive rather quickly. The biggest gripe I have is the coffee is just too weak, it defeats the point to have to use 2 k cups for a decent cup of coffee. If you like your coffee weak and don't mind the expense of the K cups, go for it."
5,Excellent Maker,"This coffee maker is such a wonderful item. I purchased one about 2 years ago for myself and have since given5 or 6 as presents, the latest to my daughter, we all LOVE them."
4,Just got it,"I was a bit apprehensive about purchasing this item most of all because I want a good cup of coffee - and one that at the very least, does not taste like plastic. WHen you open the item the first thing you notice is the very strong plastic smell especially in the tank. I ran vinegar and hot water through for about 10 cups or so and the plain, brewed water stunk of plastic. Very foul. I kept running water through but the water still smelled. Then I took the water tank and washed it really well inside with soap and water. The next cup of plain water that I brewed did not smell like plastic. I wonder if there must be a film that needs to be washed of first in order for the smell to go away. Anyway, try that and see if it helps. I'll update this review once we've used it to make coffee!"
1,keurig #5 and counting,"I'm an early adapter of technology, so purchased one of Keurig's first k-cup coffee makers several years ago. Had to replace it during the first year, no problem with Keurig doing that. Had to replace maker #2 the following year. More hassle this time from Keurig. Have since bought 2 additional, different Keurig models over the past couple years! While we love the coffee it makes, the flexibility, the economy, etc., having to replace our latest B60 in about one year is pushing me to the limit.... Is this Keurig's version of planned obsolescence?Once you're over the honeymoon, be prepared for a nasty relationship-- people without their caffeine aren't pleasant to be around... Several of my friends & family members I turned on to Keurig brewers are experiencing the same lack of durability issues. Very frustrated to be replacing a coffeemaker that's typically used to make 1 cup of coffee/day."
2,Disappointed,"I was really disappointed in this product. I received the B60 special edition Keurig as a gift, as I had wanted one for over a year. After a few days of testing, I am going to return this. The coffee was weak and the hot chocolate was terrible. I bought a reusable filter and after researching hear they crack and break. Not only that, the servicing size options barely gave me a sip of coffee out of my travel mug. I really wanted to like this coffee maker, but am not impressed at alli love Starbucks and the coffee from this was not good at all. I was very disappointed. My french press makes amazing coffee, and they cost between $20-$40. I would recommend a french press to anyone that loves good coffee. I grind my own beans and I think I will stick with this method."
4,Great single serving coffee maker!,"I was hesitant to get one of these for the longest time but really glad we finally caved and bought one. It is very convenient. I love that my husband and I can make the coffee of our choice rather than have to make an entire pot of something we don't agree on. It's also great for hot cocoa and tea. The water chamber holds a pretty good amount. We still have to refill a couple times a week but that is a really simple process. I was worried this would take up too much space on my counter, but it fits perfectly where our traditional coffee maker used to sit. I think the only downside for me is storing all of the little K-cups of coffee."
1,Loved it while it worked!,"I loved this coffee maker until it stopped working after 10 days. I have been waiting over 2 days for a technician to call me back after I've called customer service twice. They are ""experiencing a high number of calls"" currently which makes me very suspicious. I think I'll get my money back (there's a 30-day guarantee) and look for something more reliable."
2,"Easy, yes, delicious, no","I bought the Kuerig in Sept of 2008. I loved the easability of it, but found it very very noisy. I tried at least 50 different types of coffee and none of them knocked my socks off. I guess if you are not a serious coffee drinker then it would suffice. Also, the coffee is not very hot. I then tried sampling coffee from the new Dolce Gusto and I am sorry Kuerig, but you can't hold a candle. The Dolce makes drinks that rival any coffee house. It runs on 15 bars of pressure which aerates the coffee and foams the milk for cappuccino. You can make a cappuccino or a latte, from thought to cup in under two minutes. And it is so quiet, my husband doesn't need to turn the TV up everytime I want a cup of coffee"
