2,Well........I dunno.,"Jurassic Park was an edge of your seat thriller, one that makes you sweat. But if you take the technical jargon, the originality of the characters, and the delicous description out of the book, it's just another standard thrill ride. That is exactly what he did to The Lost World. The text looks suspiciously like a screenplay, and the chase scenes get tedious. Face it Mike. Jurassic Park just can't have a sequel."
4,Fun Book,"The book was better then the movie even without the visuals you get on the big screen. In my opinion this is really this authors best area, action packed fiction. You always get a good book from this author and he delivered with this one. I know the book is the next in line and written just to get a new movie out, but the book is an old fashion page-turner. If you are looking for fiction to keep your mind of heavy topics then this book is a good one to start with. It is light, easy to read and moves fast. The story is developed and fun. This guy does not write heavy, Noble Prize worthy work, just fast passed fun."
2,"""The Lost World"" My two cents.","I must admit that some parts of this book were very good, especially in the suspense department. But, aside from the obvious tension that grows as the story progresses, the book is pretty much void of any lasting literary quality, like most Michael Chirchton novels. Some parts have you on the edge of your seat, while other parts have you falling asleep. I think that ""Jurassic Park"" was somewhat better, since it had more of a plot and better characters. Why Chirchton decided to bring back Malcolm instead of Grant (or some other character who was more interesting in the original book) is beyond my comprehension.If you like a quick, easy read that's filled with action, but, as I said before, little or no literary quality, then this book is for you."
1,Regarding The Lost World,"The Lost World is a lackluster, forced sequel to Jurassic Park, a childhood favorite of mine. The fact that I could identify it as such at the age of twelve, when the book was first published, should not bode well for the prospective reader."
3,Not up to PAR of other work...,"It was a good read, but nothing new from JP. I was interested in more imaginative science and less man attacks beast, beast attacks man. The concept of the JP series is very creative and plausible, but so much more could be done with it"
4,The Turn of the Screw Part Two,"At the begininning of ""The Turn of the Screw"", Henry James states that in a novel, the presence of children is a turn in the screw of fear.Mr. Crichton has learnt the lesson.Both Jurassic Park and The Lost World are mainly based on the adventures of a couple of children, just like James' novel.The book is quite good, anyway"
5,Great and ACTION PACKED,"The LOST WORLD is another thriller from MICHAELCRICHTON. Remember IAN MALCOM from JURASSIC PARK?, well, he's back andhe has brought some friends. Ian, Doc Thorne, Eddie Carr, and two stowaways venture to the island to find dinos??? It's a little close to the first book but it is still a great book. The movie ventures way too far from the book to actually be titled the LOST WORLD but is also a good movie. By the way, my sources tell me that M.C. is working on a third book that is based on before JURASSIC PARK and is planning on writing a fourth book picking up where the book THE LOST WORLD left off. Hmmm......."
5,Tis a sad tale,"I still can't figure out why Steven Spielberg did not follow the book in Jurassic Park and Lost World! If he did, the movies would have been alot better. Anyways, Lost World is very very good. Continues alot the same as Jurassic Park, kinda same characters and so forth and so on. Story very very good, I couldn't put this one down."
2,"""Jurassic Park"" it's not","To begin with, what this book does wrong is that it brings Ian Malcom back from the dead. He died in the original ""Park,"" now he says, ""Only half-dead."" Chrichton was banking on this book being made into a movie, so he just wishy-washed his way through it. At times it is exciting and terrorifying, but more often than not disappointing."
1,Bad fit,"Like other users I had to modify the grooves to fit my bridge. Once that was done, the thing kind of teetered on top as it wasn't contoured to fit the bridge, so back to work. once I got it to fit properly, it reduced to sound a bit, but to get more muting than the rubber mute I have, I had to put a rubberband around the thing. Not exactly ideal.... Also, the picture is misleading. If you look in the picture you can see the G and E string touching the side of the ""finger"" that comes down between the strings. That is not the case. The mute rests on top of the D&A and the G&E dont touch anything. After I modified it a bit, it now rests on the G,D, & A and the E touches the finger. Maybe I was sent the wrong mute, but it doesn't seem to fit quite right despite making the groove for the bridge wider. The package said violin/viola mute, but maybe its just for a viola. Unfortunately because I modified it I can't return it."
5,My new favorite pan,This pan is an exceptional value for the price. Food is prepared with ease and precision making this pan a most valuable tool. I would recommend this pan to anyone as either their fist cooking utensil or to round out a set. Highly recommended.
5,AWESOME!!!,"I don't agree that it was just a show. I feel that Deitrick and the other performers were very sincere. I love the praise and worship on this DVD. I pretty much love every song, but ""You Are God"" was a stand out for me, it just really touched my heart because it is a song that's just about how great, mighty, wonderful, loving and of course I could go on and on about God. Everything about that song is just beautiful from the lyrics to the music, the singing and the arrangement, but all of the songs are great. That song just expresses a place that I want to go and stay there, those of you who long to constantly keep that relationship with God where it should be knows what I am talking about. I love just about everything that Deitrick Haddon and Damita and Voices of Unity has put out and if you just listen to the lyrics they are just annoited and awesome. I think anyone would be happy with this DVD if you love praise and worship."
4,Pricey but worth it,"I bought this Sung Si Kyung CD for my wife who just loves him. She loves the CD and listens to it everyday and mentions the good quality of the music so I guess the CD quality is good.I wish it didn't have to travel from Japan to get here b/c that's what set me back extra money. It was way too expensive a price for just one CD. Other than that, I'm happy with this purchase and we actually got the product quickly as well."
3,The missing index hurts a fine book.,"This book was purchased for my Administrative Law Class at the University of Missouri, School of Law. I am delighted that the author gives fair and equal time to the doctrines of federalism, orginalism, and formalism. It is somewhat surprising to encounter this level of balance anywhere in academia. However, much to my great disappointment the author choose not to include an index in the book. This could just be a problem related to my advanced age and crusty world view. As a very non-traditional life-long learner, and now as a law student, I guess I've grown quite used to text books on subjects of this sophistication having an index. The missing index is the reason for my giving this book only three stars. Otherwise, this casebook would have received four stars."
5,Best book on ADHD,"This book is the best book on ADHD that I have seen (and I have read several of them). Its easy to read and tells you everything you need to know about ADHD, from basic stuff to advanced knowledge. It explores ADHD from every aspect and offers solutions and speculations.I highly recommend it. This is a life saver for any ADHD parent and makes you realize that having a child with ADHD doesnt have to mean the end of the world. With this book in hand you have everything you need to face this challenge."
4,Great Flick!,"I agree with Jason Jones. This movie IS a nod to a better time. The actors/actresses in this film did an outstanding job. My son is 10 and I'd like for him to see this film! I collect movies, I've been building my library and cannot wait for this to come out on DVD. Check it out."
3,"Good game, despite, being buggy.","Temple of Elemental Evil is a mixed experience, but most negative aspects can be avoided by looking for game patches online. I'd reccomend not downloading the 1.3 patch, just the preceeding patches.After that you will be pleasantly suprised. This is one of the best games based on the 3.5 D&D; in terms of the tactical combat options available to you. They absolutely nail it.There is also differences in plot based on what alignment you choose so there is a lot of replay value. The story, while not epic, is decent. This games strength is the strong dungeon crawl/combat aspect though.On the downside, even with the patch, load times and pauses are long in some spots. It takes a second or two for the load/save game menu to come up for example.Overall though, an enjoyable experience."
1,Stay away from The Temple of Elemental Evil,"The DRM on the CD might keep you from ever playing this game. I have never been able to get this game to run. Don't waste your $$ on this game. You can have my copy if you want it, it's no good to me...except as a coaster set."
1,Does not run at all.,"I enjoyed the other 2 Troika games (Arcanum and VtM:Bloodlines), so I thought I would give this one a go. Unfortunately, after several hours dealing with it, I still can't get this piece of trash to run at all. I meet the system requirements, it just won't run. I've narrowed down the causes of why it isn't running, but that hasn't helped.Possible cause #1: The game will only run in 75hz. My lcd monitor only runs in 60hz. I found a way to disable the intro movies, which also want to run only in 75hz, but not a way to change the way the game renders.Possible cause #2: SecureRom. Like all pieces of trash, I mean fine quality games from Atari, this is loaded with SecureRom. Sometimes you can get around this with no-cd patches. But should I really have to resort to piracy to play a game that I just *barely* purchased?So, I ended out throwing this against the wall in frustration. This is the LAST $[...] that Atari will get from me."
5,Everything I had hoped,"I bought this nailer to complete a project installing new baseboards in my house. I was very pleased with the results. It's not as heavy as I had expected (based upon other reviews) - it worked flawlessly. So much better than dealing with a compressor and hoses. I also considered the more expensive 34 degree nailer, but I'm glad I didn't spend the extra money... this one did everything I needed and the extra expense would not have been worth it. Highly recommended."
5,"quality tool, even from dewalt","I'm a trim carpenter, and custom cabinet installer, so I use this gun on a regular basis. My company purchased the gun to avoid the whole compressor and hose situation. Its alot quicker especially when you only need to install a couple pieces of molding. At first I was skeptical, especially because I've given up on buying yellow tools! However, this gun has been in good working condition for over 1 year, and thats heavy use all year. The battery is still holding up, and I rarely have to charge it. I have'nt had a problem with nails not setting...ever. It has jammed a couple times, but usually if you hit a screw or nail in the wood. The weight is probably the only drawback, but it beats using passlode gas cartridges and much less problematic. Definitely worth the money!"
4,great tool nearly perfect,"i must admit i was somewhat skeptical about dropping 400 bucks on a tool that hadnt been out all that long but it has definitely proven its worth. we have two other ones and the only problem i seem to encounter is that it doesnt like to advance when shooting 2 and a half inch nails at times. all three guns seem to act up only when using the large nails but only intermittently. Other than that its a great tool for trim, especially baseboards because it doesnt kick any drywall dust."
4,I could learn to like tomato wine,"The book is easy to read, in a user-friendly format. The book is written more as a recipe book than the chemical- experiment type of winemaking books. The fear of making wine is addressed early on in the book, and the short recipes are very interesting. For example, there are ""recipes"" (rather than formulas) for tomato and other fruit wines. And, as the author mentions, if you try to make beer you could make yourself or someone else ill, but if you try your hand at making wine and you fail, you have a designer vinegar."
3,"Like it but not the ""best book out there""",I am with the reviewer who feels the recipes are similar with only different base ingredients. It seems the book could have more content. Once you are done with the basic information up front you sort of set the book down and don't pick it up again. Seems a shame that I'm not drawn to read the whole thing.I do like the book. It is good information for beginners. Just can't give it 4 or 5 stars.
5,Sanctus Real,"I love this cd. It was not scratched, it was a reasonable price and it came within a few days, I give this product 5 stars."
1,MAC USERS BE WARNED!!!! DO NOT BUY THIS SCANNER!!!!!!!,"The software that comes with this scanner claims to be Mac compatible. It really is not. This scanner simply DOES NOT WORK with a MAc OS system, at least not with my Intel 10.4.9. The EPSPON SCAN software does not boot up automatically. I was able to scan using the horrendous Arcsoft Photoimpression software, but only at the lowest resolution. Arcsoft crashes with anything over 800 dpi.How EPSPON can even claim their product is MAC-compatible is an almost fraudulent claim on their part. Call to EPSON yielded ZERO results. A NIGHTMARE.This may work with Windows. IT IS A TERRIBLE PRODUCT FOR MAC."
3,"Difficult, but worth it?","'Devil's Tor' is Lindsay's magnum opus -- a great, sprawling monolith of a novel. The basic premise is brilliant --- two parts of a supernatural flint are brought together after millennia of separation by a man and a woman who are destined to be the progenitors of a new race (homo superior). Unfortunately, Lindsay's prose style at the end of his writing career had deteriorated badly, clouding his 'vision' (compare 'Devil's Tor' to the relative simplicity and directness of 'The Haunted Woman'). The result is not the towering achievement it ought to have been, but a crippled masterpiece. Nonetheless, anything by Lindsay is still worth reading. Even at his worst, he is still one of the most unique minds of the twentieth century."
3,Not as funny as I expected...,"I read in a review that Vowell compares to Sedaris...not even close; although, I found some of the stories entertaining..."
4,Four Stars and Counting,"This is the second book I've read by Sarah,and I applaud her decision to provide even us less than scholarly readers a book that is an easy read. I appreciated that her essays were clear, concise and purely written. Best of all I have discovered another storyteller and that in my opinion is always a good deal."
3,inbetween genres,"Is this a witty memoir in which an author describes quirky tales from her childhood that embarass her whole family? Or is it an account of important parts of American history? After reading Sarah Vowell's book, I really couldn't tell.Towards the beginning, the author talks about keeping important matters and information from your friends and family members, apparently this also applies to her readers, because through out the whole time reading this book, I felt like she was keeping her audience at bay. Stories were told without much background or emotional intimacy, keeping me as a reader at a distance.Woven through out the chapters, was commentary on and the recollection of American History, which, while mildly interesting, seemed quite out of place.This book made me feel uneasy, despite the authors entertaining writing style. My suggestion: more David Sedaris, less 8th grade history textbook."
1,Boring,"I think that one word says it all. I read the other reviews and expected to be rolling around laughing at this book. The first essay was promising but turned out dull in the end and the book went down hill from there. I found nothing clever or at all funny in vowell's writing. After the fourth essay I skipped around trying to find the interesting parts, but in the end had to give up and toss it away. Don't waste your money."
4,Really nice little skillet!,"I have been really impressed by this skillet thus far (after about half a dozen uses). I feel like I could be a Food Network chef flipping the food in the skillet one-handed because of the great nonstick properties! I don't cook eggs often but the two times I did cook them in this skillet, I was REALLY impressed by how readily the egg slid from the pan. I'm not one of those people who keep one pan only for one thing so I've used it to cook a grilled cheese sandwich and a few other things and it has performed like a star on every task thus far!I am a person who HATES to wash dishes, so the easy ""cleanability"" of this pan was a HUGE bonus. Even with cheese melted all over, it wiped right out! And I love that the handle is metal so it can go right in the oven. I haven't used it for that yet but, since it's the only skillet I own with a metal handle, I'm sure it will be hitting the oven at some point!"
3,Does what it is supposed to do (almost).,"If you need to install or remove one of the bottom brackets that this tool is designed for, this is the low cost tool.If your BB is stuck, removing it with this tool is problematic as you have to put a pipe on the end of the tool, and hold the tool onto the cup while you try and turn. If torquing your BB to its recommended setting is important to you, look elsewhere as there is no way to attach a torque wrench to this tool.Three stars because it does what it is supposed too, minus two stars because you cant torque to a known setting, and removing stuck BB's is not ideal. If the tool had a 1/2"" or 3/8"" square hole in it that fit a torque wrench I would probably give it five stars."
3,Good Read,"I am a fan of Johansen's old Loveswepts, especially the Sedikhan stories, from their original 1980's publication.It is a Category, so it's a very quick read. But you will smile, maybe tear up, and spend a little time with characters that capture your interest. The occasional social references that are more than 30 years old are obviously dated, but you can ignore them as easily as the technological ones: the ""oooh"" Selectric typewriter for an author made me laugh.Enjoy."
3,"OK Wiggle Pen, Fun but Flimsy","My son uses a vibrating pen in OT for fine motor coordination and hand strengthening. This pen definitely has a wiggle to it. In fact, my hand hurt after using it for just a couple of minutes. It was fun to write with, and my child certainly enjoys it. It's not made of very thick plastic, pretty flimsy. Not sure how long it is going to last with continual use. The description says it comes with 5 refills, but our packaging only had 3. One already in the pen and two on the side. There was no other area for 2 additional refills to be, the product with shrink wrapped in that hard plastic shell casing. The ink does not write very dark, so again, not sure how long one refill will last. This pen will be fun while it lasts."
4,Lily's Mom,"I purchase these at a major retailer many years ago when my kids were small and looked for a long time to replace them, so I was thrilled to find them on Amazon. My kids loved to use them when they were younger and now I can have them when my grandchildren come over. They provide hours of fun."
1,This product has really gone downhill!,"I have used Wiggle Writers for years in my job as a school-based occupational therapist. This one wouldn't even screw together properly, so the battery contact was deficient. As soon as you try to write with it, it shuts off. I wish they would sell the refills separately, because I still have plenty of the pens."
1,Struck out looking with an 0-2 count,"This book is weak. This is trivia and really nothing more. I have caught Perry's articles on the national website he works for and I am unimpressed with both this book and his columns. Extreme bias and inability to look at baseball as a game and a sport leave Perry with a backwards ""K"". Pick up anything from Bill James, Peter Angell or the Baseball Prospectus and you will do much better than this ""writing."""
4,Good Book for a Snowy Day,"And plenty of snow there is, adding proper atmosphere to a brooding mystery. Good character development, plausible (most of the time) plot lines, some weird characters, painted so as to generate maximum hatred or respect. When the lady from the Forest Service first appears, you almost can hear readers hissing all across America. When the sheriff gets snide with Pickett, you want to relish what you hope will be his humiliation before the book ends. Scenes at the snowed-in Pickett household are poignant in light of future plot turns. A good page turner, with nicely done descriptions of the Big Horn Mountain area of almost-mystical Wyoming. May you write long and well, C.J. Box."
5,FANTASTIC AS USUAL!!,"Joe Pickett is one of the most 'readable' characters around. If you haven't tried these books, you're missing some great escape time!!"
2,not his best,"Reading this story was too much like work. Most of the new characters were just mean, stupid or evil. Skip this one and save the dough."
3,"Good projection, flawed story","The technology projection and some of the AI concepts explored are very well done, especially given when it was written. The book itself suffers from some flat & predictable elements (a la a standard SF-action movie), a slow windup, and what seems an implausible set up for the second half (i.e., not a very good experiment). Finally, the characters never seemed to reach full 3D development.Overall, an entertaining read, some very interesting ideas, and a story wrapper that I wish could've been set up better. If you're reading for just the ideas and are not familiar with the AI concepts in the book, this is well worth it. If you're familiar with the concepts, then this can be an enjoyable read anyway."
3,Most realistic coming of AI novel?,"The birth of true Artificial Intelligence is a well worn science fiction and thriller subject. ""The Two Faces of Tomorrow"" is a great example of the genre. However, this appears to be like old grade B scify movies that talked a great game but delivered little (The Outer Limits TV show comes to mind). Not that it is bad, just badly paced and the writing stilted. I loved it when I read it growing up, but on a second reading it did not hold up as a story. As an ideas vehicle it was great."
1,Director,"Elsewhere, the director of this poor film is listed as Tito Capobianco. That is incorrect; the director is Vaclav Kaslik."
3,"Great stories, murky print quality","The stories themselves are excellent, I highly reccomend them. The character of Father Brown indeed ranks right up there with Sherlock Holmes as a sleuth, and is the sort of person you wish you knew. My issue is with the book proper. To squeeze all the stories into one volume the typeface is a teeny bit small. But worse, the quality of the printing is murky. I nearly went nuts thinking it was my new eyeglasses giving me headaches until I showed the book to a professional printer with good eyesight who told me it was the print quality at fault. I don't re-read the stories like I want to because I can't bear more eyestrain and headaches, it's terribly annoying. If I could find a good replacement with crisp print on smooth paper, maybe a two-volume set, I'd buy it in a heartbeat."
1,they should not have bothered,i am sorry i bought this one. stilted language makes for a slow boring read. it does make you appreciate how far race relations have come because i have never seen the n word so often nor read so many disparaging comments about people of color.
1,The Whole Soy Cookbook,"I was very disappointed with this cookbook. I have been a vegetarian for 10 years. None of the recipes in this book were appealling to me. I stopped eating meat for many reasons, including just not enjoying the taste. This book calls for a lot of fake ""meat"". If I don't want to eat real sausage fake sausage isn't going to much for me either. I would not recommend this to anyone."
2,"Reads well, but overall weak","If this is a 4+ star book (as the others who have reviewed the book seem to think) then the state of Gulf War scholarship must be very low indeed. Atkinson's tale is an unorganized patchwork of escapades, vignettes and personality clashes among generals that provides some interesting stories but no solid overall narrative. We get VERY little on Bush, the role of Congress, army medicine, the coalition forces, army structure--not even much on the weaponry. It appears to be a slapped together book for a hungry market, with precious little interpretation or analysis."
5,bead barrel,"If your daughter likes beading she will enjoy this kit. It contains hundreds of beads, most of the wooden, and string. Makes for a fun rainy day activity."
5,Wonderful assortment of beads,"The quality, variety, and quantity of beads in this assortment is awesome. Especially love the charms and the storage boxes that they come it, but also just love all the colors, textures, and sizes of the beads. Will make for lots and lots of fun making some very pretty jewelry. My 4 year old (and I) are very happy with this purchase. Only wish the beads with letters were bigger and fancier - that's the only negative in an otherwise great collection."
5,love it!,I have had this set about three weeks and I absolutely love it. Not only does it cook well but it looks great. I highly recommend it!
4,Takes Some Effort,"If you are a modern American male reading ""The Blind Assassin"" you will probably hate the first 3/4 of this novel. The problem you are having is not the author, it is the swoony Victorian narrative voice.The narrator is a ""bird in a guilded cage"" to which things happen. World Wars are annoying. Money is a mystery. Work is something ""other people"" have to do.Everything is the fault of the men. Men are two dimensional. Men are too weak or too strong or somehow both. Men create the limits while women are helpless. Men create the world of luxury that women ""suffer"" in.Enter the Communist.When (if) you reach the final 1/4 of the novel, you will discover that the narrator HAD to be like this, to hold opinions like this, for the story to continue as it does. It's OK to dislike her for her actions and her world-view.If you still want to read The Blind Assassin, my advice is to aquire an audiobook version. The spoken ""confession"" is far more compelling than the written one."
2,Tedious,I couldn't get interested in the story or the characters. I stopped reading the book after 200 pages.
2,"Clever Words, Rotten People","The only character who has a clean (pure) view of the world and the people in it is Laura, who is ostracized, marginalized, mocked and institutionalized by the poeple who are supposed to love her. Everyone else in the story is small-minded, greedy, self-involved, and cruel. Big Deal.Atwood is a sharp writer and has a catchy turn of phrase, but her characters are so vicious or appallingly weak that you really don't care at all what becomes of any of them.Worst is Iris, who despite having a galaxy of personal battles to fight, sits on the sidelines and twiddles her little thumbs and lets other people do the living for her. She's a sickening nitwit.Atwood can write, but she can't entertain, at least not with this novel. As for the Booker Prize, the best readers know not to confuse excellent writing with a good read."
1,Too much work,"I really wanted to like this novel because I loved Alias Grace, but it was just too much work to keep up with the characters AND the sci fi novel the one sister wrote (altho that did seem to be the more interesting story of the two). The Blind Assassin did not hold my interest. I like to be swept away by the characters and this did not happen in this book."
3,dark,"The story was interesting and the writting and decriptions are good, but I thought that the story and the live of the characters was a little dark for my liking. The main characters are depressing and sad most of the time. If you are looking for a fun book with some supense, this is not the book for you."
2,Blindsided by Weak Ending,"This noir novel within a novel opens with a mysterious car wreck and centers around two lovers who meet in a dingy backstreet room. A complex and complicated read, despite all the effort needed to piece together all the clues sprinkled along the way, the reader is punished by a weak, unsatisfying ending."
4,A pleasurable read on a deserted island,"Here's my assessment: Moments of genius overshadowed by excessive digression. This book takes a lot of patience to read, and I'm not sure my efforts were justified by reaching the end. There are true inspirational literary gems sprinkled throughout the novel, but you have to wade slowly forward through a lot of unnecessary desription to discover them. A good read for a slow vacation, a dubious choice for a busy mom."
3,"Interesting storytelling, but not a very interesting story","While the way in which the narrative is presented is complex and novel, I found that the story itself got bogged down at times and was rather tedious. I finished the book and, having pieced together the convoluted story, felt that it had not really been worth my time or the 500+ pages."
2,A very good half a book,"...but I feel cheated out of the second half. Atwood spends ~500 pages twisting three stories in and out, drawing connections and parallels that aren't immediately apparent, following the Chase sisters through their childhood and early adult lives, building up to a crescendo of family crisis and betrayal - and then stops. All loose ends are not so much tied up as simply snipped off in a mere 20 pages or so. I feel as though I was told half the story, and then dropped cold."
4,"A Novel with an ""Echo""","The Blind Assassin is the first book I've read by Margaret Atwood, and I must say, it was excellent. Although I am usually not fond of a plot that leaves the reader guessing throughout (mostly because the author fails, and I know ""who done it"" right away), THIS novel kept me guessing right up until the end.Atwood does an incredible job of telling a story within a story (within a story), being careful not to slip and give away the ending. She seems to have a knack for getting the reader to really care for her characters. I will certainly be reading more by this author!"
5,"""Done it again"" is right!",I believed Atwood had attained her acme of story telling in Alias Grace until I read this completely absorbing tale of two sisters. Atwood is such a poet - one cannot escape that when reading her novels. Her sense of humour often arrived at from her powers of observation and a mocking attitude continues to engage my interest in her as one of the greatest Canadian authors.
2,Depressing,"I honestly couldn't finish the book entirely. It started out with an intriging concept people dying in questionable circumstances, lovers meeting in secret, and a science fiction story woven in; however, it quickly turned into generic married the wrong person, children molested, horrible life content that I have grown so tired of. The narrarator was often boring and the book moved at a snails pace. If you enjoy dark books, you might enjoy this, but if you are like me and enjoy more uplifting books, this is not the book for you. I have never read Margaret Attwood before so I went into this with out any preconcieved notions, but I can't say I will probably read anything else by her."
5,Wishing my airline flight had been even longer,"I picked this book up in an airport to start on a 4-hour flight, figuring I would read it the next few weeks. I was disappointed when the plane touched down -- I wanted another 4 hours to finish the book. I read the remainder on the return flight two days later. It is just SO beautifully woven together. Iris (the narrator)really knows how to spin this yarn out, and manages to create a wonderful dialogue with the reader of the entirety of the life she shared with her sister and its intrigue and deceipt. Fabulous fabulous book."
2,Max Davis,"It was too confusing.The dates go from 1945 to 1975 then to 1998 then it goes back to 1934 and 1935.Then some of it was pretty good. It is a sad story about a girl named Isabel and her parents die and she has to take over the family busines.She goes through all these depressing times.Then she meets a guy.This guy is really set out to kill her.So will she die or not that is for you to find out. I didnt like the book maybe you might enjoy it.This is a book for people who love mysteries, but this one is not for me."
1,"This is a scrapbook, not a novel","Overrated to say the least. Oh my. It's sooo artistic to write a novel within a novel within a novel within a novel. What's not mentioned by all the fawning reviews is that none of the stories goes anywhere before jumping to the other. I never got to where I could relate to or gain interest in any of the characters before being randomly and clumsily dumped off and thrown into an entirely disconnected narrative for no apparent reason. I really wanted to like this after all the glowing reviews and have now given up for the fourth and final time. If you want bragging rights, finish this book. If you want a good read, find something else."
4,Consuming read,Atwood managed to construct a story that I found so compelling i inhaled it in about two days. The narrative spans a couple of decades and through ingenious and smart story telling she draws you in from the very first page.I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a slightly more literary read but still enjoys a good mystery novel.
3,Avoid if you aren't fluent in calculus!,"After reading about quantum physics in other popular books (How to Teach Physics to your Dog, Deep Down Things), I was looking for a book with a little more math, because a formula says more than a thousand words, right? Well, I have a masters degree in (computer) science, but unfortunately, my math skills are way too feeble to understand this book. Unfortunately, the author often doesn't explain in words what the formulas mean, so if you don't understand them, this book is pretty much pointless (save for the first two chapters). The author lost me even before delving into the quantum chapters!So avoid this book if you don't have a solid math background, i.e. you don't have an intuitive understanding of calculus, differential equations, complex numbers, etc."
5,More Larry Williams!!!,"Just got my CD, Beautiful Struggle. I'm no music critic, just a jazz fan and someone who appreciates the real thing. Larry Williams' compositions, arrangements and performances are second to none. A musical tapestry of heart and soul and emotion. What an amazing artist. Would go anywhere to see him live in the US or even Europe..."
5,Awesome,"Wood has an awesome talent and this video contains some of her best vintage material. A little old now but still hilariously funny and well worth the 13.99. It amazes me she has never released an album of her comedy songs, some of which she performs for our side splitting delight here."
3,sew a beautiful wedding dress,Disappointing as there were not many vintage styles especially for coordinating styles. Thanks for your service! Cheers and good luck.
4,Sewing a wedding dress,"This is a good concise book with a traceable bride for your ideas. God hints for wedding planning as well as a timeline.You need to be knowledgable with sewing, not a beginners book. Brief chapters with hints and sketches that you may overlook if it weren't for these reminders.Not all of us sew formal wear every day and it may have been several years between the prom gowns and the wedding gowns. I know I will refer to this book many times while creating the wedding dress of my future daugher-in-law."
4,Sherlock,I love watching the old Black and White movies on a rain day. And there nothing like Sherlock Holmes 1944-47 movies
2,new lawyer is a creep,"this new lawyer character, ben logan or whatever his name is, is just annoying. kate can carry this series, she doesn't need a sidekick. throw this guy out and get better writers."
2,The true story of jazz still hasn't been told.....,"I read this book because: of my love for old school jazz and the big ""HOOPLA"" over this publication! I can't say that I gained much knowledge from this book. If you are a true collector of jazz and know Duke Ellington, Louis Armstrong, Lee Morgan, Charlie Parker, Dizzy, Wes Montgomery, Freddie Hubbard, Billie Holiday, Coltrane and others then you already know more or as much as what is written here.You've got 512 pages to tell a story about a subject so diverse and complex that I don't know how he did it and felt that justice was done! What I would have preferred he did was to write several books on jazz EACH concentrating on a particular era. That way I think the public would get a true and comprehensive study of our most beautiful and natural resource--jazz. Sorry but I can't offer a rating higher than 2 - 2 1/2 stars."
5,GREAT BOOK,This is a must buy for anyone who has a strong willed child! It has great tips and advise! I would definitely recommended this to all my friends!
4,A good movie marred only by the transition to video.,"The original movie is a wonderful adaptation of the same novel. However, in moving to video, crucial scenes have been edited diminishing the overall neuroses of Aunt Vera as well as other members in the family. Recommendation: record it when it airs again on the television."
5,TIMELESS AND OUTSTANDING,A benchmark bench reference book for established and trainee pathologists: an histopathology trainee's bible. It is timeless and outstanding. Editors are bang up-to-date and move with the times. See something new down your microscope and can't put your finger on it? It is in Rosai's book. CDRom enclosed.
3,Most of it is common sense,Not much that any mother of young children isn't already aware of. I was hoping for new activities that were not common knowledge already.
4,Modern woman finds humorous pitfalls & romance in the past.,"This book has all of the formula requirements of a time travel romance. What I found refreshing was the heroine's view of the daily life a woman of the English privileged class 200 years ago. ie: A Nineties-kind-of-gal desparately trying to remember the history she hadn't paid too much attention to in school, but is now living in. Getting carsick in a coach rocking and rolling on unpaved roads. Having to use a chamber pot instead of a having a flush toilet and hot running water. Yes, a fairy promise helps her meet Mr. Wonderful, and her life back in the Nineties was ho-hum. But is love and the challenge of the English lifestyle enough for love to conquer all? All of this is done with the light touch of humor which the author uses to have her heroine relay her situation to us."
4,"Sensual, rhythmic poetry.","C.D. Wright's poetry has a sway to it. It is honest, carnal. There's something dance-like about it. Its hard to pinpoint why I like it so much. Its just so full of life. I especially like her girl friend poems. They really struck a chord in me. This is my favorite line from Girl Friend Poem #2: ""Today is the best day since yesterday/We share a sense of rivers..."""
1,Pike takes another nose dive,"I've been reading Pike's work for well over 7 years now and this is just getting pathetic. After such wonderful books like Remember Me, The Party triology, and Chain Letter, I can't believe this is published under his name.Unlike some of the other readers, I did not find this suspensefull at all. You can predict what happens in the first half of the novel. It's most likely Pike's own fault for creating a crime with only four people, two of which die. Gee...I wonder who the killer is?Secondly, I felt his treatment of homosexuality was really rather false and glossed over. It just pops up in the novel without any real depth, and at times seems to turn toward a bias against it.Overall, I would like to see some more of the Pike there used to be with the intricate plots and a varity of characters. If you want to read Pike, PLEASE don't read this book! Pick one of the earlier ones, they are tons better."
1,"No, not very good.","I am a big C.Pike reader. But, WHAT IS THE POINT OF THE BOOK? It had no depth at all, and the mystery was not very hard to solve.The homosexualism seemed biased, implying that they are crazed maniacs. Seems like Hannah was not partrayed correctly.The story was simple. _Too simple_. It was not worth it. Characters were simple, and easy to see through. And again, I stress this, *COMPLICATED PLOTS ARE BETTER THAN SIMPLE, FLAT, 1D [LINEAR] PLOTS.*I do not understand *why this book is good to you guys?* Previous books were *much* more suspenseful than 'EXECUTION OF INNOCENCE'.And, WHAT IS THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE TITLE? It makes no sense -- no innocents were executed, and ONLY DICK WAS KILLED, AND I DON'T THINK HE WAS AN INNOCENT, DO YOU?!?!!!?(just a few more more !, I promise you) !!?!Thank-you for reading my outburst of emotions. It is much appreciated.P.S. = only read this book of you want to lose faith in C. Pike"
3,Strange,"I thought this book was nice. It was wasn't very twisted, but then again, maybe Christopher Pike was feeling non-violent when he wrote it. I like many of his earlier books much better, and this one seems thrown together in order to fill a quota. Still, if you like a good, predictable murder mystery, this book is for you! Still, my faith in Mr. Pike has not wavered. He's a cool guy."
2,The most recent and most disappointing,"The most recent Final Fantasy (FF) game by square has let me down. Although the graphics are amazing the story was long and game play lacking. I will admit I love RPGs and I love classics, but this stacks no where near any recent or previous RPGs. The plot put me to sleep and the game played for about 35 hours. FF8 has a futuristic theme (more so than most RPGs) and what ever happened to MP? I liked leveling up to gain my power in MP and gaining spells through experience. This most recent FF game has been a real let down and I feel you should rent this game before you buy it (note: if this is your first RPG you will find it to be a great game but for RPG fans who love the classics rent this game first). It is definitely a game where opinions vary..."
4,Not as good as 7 but still good,"It's been awhile since I've played this game, I don't remember most of the character's name (except Squall and Zell) but I still love it and it's still a good comeback after 7. Even before it came out I didn't think it would be as good as 7 and I was right. The graphics of course are a little better but the main thing that I didn't like is that the villan with the blond hair (can't remember his name)was nowhere near what Sephiroth was, not even close. I know I shouldn't compare the two but I can't help it. This is still a good game to have in the collection, good storyline and great characters."
3,Slightly Disappointed,"Sorry guys, I gotta go low on this one. The game overall was rather poor, the story line mixed and matched at the best. the only redeeming factor for this game is the CG animation. The Animation on this game is excellent, including what I deem as the best fight scene ever portrayed in a game. But alas, even with the excellent animation, this game couldn't be saved in my eyes. As for any game that is four disks long that I can beat in under 40 hours with getting 99% of the items in the game just isn't worth it."
3,Under rated Game,I would have enjoyed this game more if I would have gotten the walkthrough guide I order with it.
5,This is the best game I have ever played and....,"I don't care what anybody else thinks.It has awesome graphics, is not too hard and not too easy,and the storyline is amazing, it will make you laugh, cry, and jump up and down in joy."
3,"Better than VII, but not a masterwork.","Okay, so I've beaten every Final Fantasy game in the known universe. Now we come to VIII. First, I would like to say that it is very definitely better than VII (wouldn't take much...), but it certainly does not match up to the greatness of IV, VI, and even III. Far too many plot points are inadequately explored, and Squall's relationship with Rinoa (and Seifer, for that matter) doesn't get nearly enough attention. The secondary characters don't get a lot either. It is a decent enough game; certainly compelling enough to play through, but it isn't wonderful. For classic RPGing goodness, go for Genso Suikoden II."
4,Another Final Fantasy hit brought to you by Squaresoft.,"In Final Fantasy 8, the main character is Squall, he is perceived as a cold, non-caring person. I don't like him that well, he is mean to Rinoa who is a beautiful woman, I don't see who could be someone who looks like her. The only reason this game gets 4 stars is because the main character is not one of the best of Final Fantasy.The game is about Squall, who is a member of SeeD, a special force of his Garden, which is kind of like a school. He is instructed to a mission in Timber with the help of 2 other SeeD members, Zell and Selphie, two of my favorite characters. Soon they all are thrown into a mission to assassinate a sorceress and then it turns into much more. But that's what Final Fantasy games are all about.I love this game and I have played it many times, I'm now in the middle of FF9, and I love it all the same. Pretty soon I'll write a review for that too."
3,OK....,"After Final Fantasy VII, this was a significant disappointment. The graphics were ok, but the character movements were very jerky, which defeated the attempyt at making them look more lifelike than those of VII. The junction system is an interesting attempt to make magic different, but it was rather complicated. I'd say that replay value is very little and the battle system was nothing exciting. It's a decent game with some nice new ideas, but disappointing."
4,"Good, but there are so many better RPGs","Yes, it is a good game. But admittedly Square didn't do as good as they could have. Junctioning tends to be VERY tedious, far outclassed by FF7's materia. The story is somewhat lacking, the characters are just very dull.On the upside, it is still a good game with great graphics, and some incredibly cool moments. I'd give it 3.5 if I could, but I guess 4 will have to do."
3,It's an averge for a Squaresoft game...,"'Kay, first of all the pros...1. The graphics aren't the most consistent, i.e. the 2-d scenery for the cities. But the FMVs kick butt. 2. Great music. 3. The Laguna story was great, I wish they did his instead of Squall's.Cons...1. The battle system is just not fun. 'Nuff said. 2. The storyline is just a little to cheesy for me. There's a bunch of stuff that needs work but it would take forever to cover. 3. There's really no change in the characters 'cept Squall. 4. GFs, good animations, but too long and their power in the game is messed up. 5. A bit long and most of it is spent on the random battles."
4,One of the better RPG games,"ok, at first i didn't like this game because it seemed really boring but I played on and i grew to like it a lot. the chracters are all really cool and you get very attached to them throughout the game. the graphics and the music are awesome and they are a big plus. the only reason that i gave this game 4 stars is because the storyline was kinda hard to catch onto at first and it got a little mixed up at some places in the game. but overall this game was great and if you don't already have it, get it!!"
3,it's not 7... but is fun...,"I like FF8, don't get me wrong, but the fact is with 7 I I played it relentlessly for four weeks-with over 60hrs of game play,And after I I reached the third disc I put it down to play 8. I'm half way through the game and currently stuck but the thing is I don't have much care to presue it the way I did 7. I was disapointed in the new junction systems and the way of recieving the GF's let me sum it up... 7 I went thru without a guide, with 8 I had to get one so that I could figure out some of it. to be honest I swore off guides for 7 until I beat it once then it was only to find out what I missed and how to get it. I own FF7,FF8,FFT, & FFA the four released for playstation. but still 7 is my Fav..."
2,The first 3 minutes were great and that's about it...,"I must admit that the only thing FFVIII has going for it is the amazing graphic cuts, especially the opening one. Unfortunately it spoils the rest of the game, which in my mind is pretty much worthless. The new junction system is confusing and pointless. Drawing magic ... and the spells don't compare to the previous final fantasy titles. The most annoying part in my mind was the fact that you run into enemies about every 5 steps, it's mildly fun at first but it gets really old. The story is dull and pointless. The characters have no personality. It really just doesn't measure up to what the rest of the FF games are all about. My recommendation- rent this one before you even think about spending more than 5 bucks on it, you can pretty much just watch the opening FMV scene and you've seen all the good parts."
1,Worst FF game ever,"About the only positive thing I can say about this game is the graphics are great. The play is slow, the characters are juvenile, the GF system is confusing, and the plot is just plain boring. A waste of time and money, unless, of course, all you want is cool graphics."
1,"somehow, clouds smells, really bad, i mean, really bad","when i started playing this game, i was able to smell cloud. he smelled like cheap girlie perfume, which told me alot about this guy...er....character. basically cloud is always constipated and has many friends who think he has the hiccups. so you see, this game is very bad."
4,He plays it a lot,10 y.o. seems to play it quite a bit. I know it would be better if it had been a game for PS II. But he hasn't even been through it all the way and started it in January (now July). He seems to like final fantasy in general though.
3,not as good as ff7,"Final fantasy 8 is a good game, dont get me wrong. Its just that compared to the other final fantasy games, well, there is no comparison! ff 8 has no armor or accesories at all, the magic system is [awful] [the magic somehow makes you better in physical combat and you have to draw it from your enemys-what the heck!] and you only get about 5 different weapons per person, and they arent even really diferent weapons, just ""upgraded."" final fantasy 2-7 were all, for the most part, better than #8 in my little opinion. Still, it has good graphics and I had a good time playing it, so I shouldnt complain to much. Its just kind of a let down after ff7, thats all. [I realize that most people that care about video games disagree with me, but thats my story and i'm sticking to it!]"
3,"Tedious, a review by Lestat","Looking at all these 5 star reviews I am flabbergasted. Let the truth be known the only fantasy in this game is that it's actually good. THe whole thing is an exercise in tedium, and this is because of one thing, Gaurdian forces. Playing through this game I now detest them. Watching the same sequence over and over can just be downright annoying. The junction system is kind of lame as well, You will be drawing spells so long youll forget the plot elements. I did. I gave it 3 stars because at times this game can be really beautiful. Yeah thats right ""beautiful"". The card game was also a fun diversion. IN conclusion, being a veteran of final fantasy 1-8(thanks to console emulation), I have to say this fantasy is not their finest hour, but if you play it long enough you will see some epic elements that in the long run dissapoint, as you imagine how good this game could have been."
3,The First Big Disappointment from Square,"Well, this was the first in a series of disappointing games from SquareSoft released for Playstation (followed by SaGa Frontier 1 and 2, Chrono Cross, Legend of Mana, Vagrant Story...) Don't get me wrong, even the poorer SquareSoft titles are a cut above most games, but compared to the innovation and quality of previous stories, Final Fantasy VIII really falls short. The magic system is irritating at best, and the story isn't nearly as compelling as Final Fantasy 6, 7 or 9. Worth playing, but not worth playing instead of FF9."
2,Final Fantasy VIII,"I sorry to say but the game suffers badly from bordom and lack of fun. The only reason i bought it was the name ""Final Fantasy"" i bet that is the case for alot of you. The game may have better graphics but that is not a good reason to say it is the best game ever. The battle system is boring and lacks the Final Fantasy way. Drawing magic can make a person go nuts. When your character levels up so do you enemys that kills the whole reason of trying to level up. I say stay away but if you are a true fan of the Final Fantasy games get it. I'm sorry if you do not see it my way, but it has sucked my life trying to finish it because i wanted to get rid of it. It is not all bad (the music was very nice) but overall the GF/Magic system took way to long if you are a serious FF fan and want to get everything. Thank you for your time and i hope you think or rent this game before buying."
3,Not the best FF,"In fact, I can honestly say that I enjoyed FF4 better than this game. The higher points in this game were the complex battle system and the orchestrated music.Square decided to drop their morals a few notches by letting you summon butt-naked women to smash your enemies."
2,Not that impressive,"After finally playing FF7, I think I was expecting too much from FF8. Overall, I like the system from FF7 better. The system in FF8 is too in-depth and confusing; although I like that the creatures/enemies level up as your characters level up. I still haven't figured out what the storyline is supposed to be, and I've been playing it for about 20 hours. The graphics are impressive, but the game itself kind of sucks. I am looking forward to playing FFanthologies as soon as I have some time on my hands."
1,Can i get my money back?!,"What a poor excuse for a Final Fantasy game, this game should have never came to america. Sure, the graphics are great but the characters make me sick and the plot seems like it came right from a Baby Sitter's Club Book. The main character Squall is suffereing from teenaged agnst, please. Oh, and the magic system (the draw and juctioning system- great idea... ahahahahahahaha. If you want a GOOD Final Fantasy get 7, 9,and 2, or 3 ( 4 and 6 for those people who think that they know Japanese.) Just stay as far away from this game as you possibly can!!!!"
2,"eye-candy, but disappointing","Lots of eye candy, little plot. That's what this boils down to. Square spent far too much time on the graphics and not enough on the plot and character development. It also has an empty world.And it has Rinoa. This is the single most aggravating thing about this game, because she spends most of the game acting like a spoiled 12-year-old and doing dumb things. She is every stupid princess-in-need-of-rescuing from every bad RPG rolled into one, and I wanted her to die.The Laguna sequences were the best, but they didn't do enough with them.Basically - less FMV, less graphic stuff, and a lot more plot and character development would have saved this game. Play FFVII instead."
3,the game is so so but good rating from the pro at games,the game is cool rpg everything is goo about but you cant beat the last boss. the only way to beat him is to get LOINHEART SWORD for squaal. PLUS the weapons geting is very bad and to orqnize the magic spells take to much time but besids that the game is good buy it play it wint it
4,not bad not bad at all,"This games pretty good but I liked the other one's more while the song is nice (really nice), the cinemas are gorgeous, and the game play diverse i just didn't find this as engaging as some of the other titles in the series and truth be told after being stuck on the final boss I discovered how the junctioning system works! yup it took me to figure out how it works til the end of the game. Now this means something this game is either really hard or i'm just not very smart (sigh... it's probablt the latter much to my disappointment...)."
1,Simply Dreadful,"I'm one of those ""been around since the beginning"" FF fans, and I can say without hesitation that this was the worst entry ever. I don't think I enjoyed a minute of playing this game. The characters are two dimensional and unlikable, the villians are uninspired and uninspiring, and the plot is turgid, cliched, illogical and stupid. It's a joyless game, plain and simply. The desingers seemed to emphasize the worst elements of the other games. The graphics were superb, the cinema scenes were awe-inspiring - and then? I never felt intrigued, or involved, in the game. Playing it was like a chore. Once you get the system down, level building is actually kind of fun, but advancing the plot ISN'T! The Triple Triad mini-game was dull and time consuming. The whole thing was just terrible. Give me Kefka, crystals, Sephiroth, Terra, etc....There is nothing about this game that will endure in the RPG landscape."
1,Final Fantasy 8,I bought this tape for my grandson who really loves this game and he had worn out his.We have a PS2 in very good condition. When I got it it didn't work at all. I sent it back and requested another. Amazon was very good about sending me another FF8 CD but that one was defective also. I returned it and am still waiting for my refund.
5,A Superb 5-star winner!,"I love Squaresoft, and I love the Final Fantasy series, and after playing a great game like this, i love them both even more. The graphics are incredibly realistic and the storyline is better than most movies. It combines an incredable cinematic experiance with beautifully designed characters. Also, it isn't something that you should rent, or you'll be paying thousand of dollars in late fees! The 4 disc long game took me just under 40, yes, forty, hours to win, and I haven't even gotten everything yet! The final boss isn't as tough as Sephiroth in Final Fantasy VII, but took me several tries to beat. All in all, this game is a must have to anyone who owns a Playstation. If you don't own a Playstation, get one just to play this game. (I did!) Intriguing, exciting, beautiful, and FUN is how I describe this game in a nutshell."
5,THE BEST FF GAME EVER!!!,"This game is the best. This was the first game that I ever played. What caught me was the COOL beginning. I finished the game, and all I can say, it is a master piece. It has a great plot. Love, action, adventure, the awesome cut scenes. One little thing, it would have been better if we heard voices like FFX on my ps2. And, why is it that they don't show the kissing part with Squall and Rinoa in the end?? Come on!!!!Over all, I love the music. And........JUST BUY THE GAME."
2,That Don't Beat All,"Unfortunately, this game bored me almost instantly. If it were not for the stunning effects and my interest in the GF sequences, I would have put this one down instantly. The story line is tired and the Fantasy was Final with the last game FFVII (which was far better than its younger sibling). I was really looking forward to an exciting NEW adventure, but all I got was the same old ""Who cares attitude"" from the hero, and all of the pretty girls that try to distract him. Two stars go to Square for the intense visual display, and in-depth thought that went into the graphics. This game gave me De Ja Vous: I could of sworn I had played this one before."
5,Best Game Ever,"Simple, It's the best game ever! I love the action, the graphics, the story. I grew up on t his video game, and finally having it in my home, completed me.:)"
1,Horrible,"the beginning of each disk, where the PS2 reads, the first 10 rings, or so are scratched up beyond compare, so unless a game is 30+ mins through and a file is made. it is not possible to play, from the beginning of any of the 4 disks.... horrible"
3,"A classic, but not really a Final Fantasy",A great RPG but it doesnt play anything like the rest of the Final Fantasy franchise.
3,"Not GREAT, but pretty good","I bought this together with Final Fantasy VII, and when I played VIII, I was somewhat displeased with it.Let me start by saying that the graphics for this game are the BEST you'll find out there for the Playstation game console; the cutscenes almost seem real.Now, the disadvantages: Tutorials make the game extremely boring. Towards the beginning of the game, some lady teaches you something about ""junctions"" for a half an hour, and I couldn't remember any of it afterwards. There is also no plot. You seemingly walk around different towns and fight random bosses that have nothing to do whatsoever with the actual story, if there was any.So, I recommend that you try other Final Fantasy games first, like IX and VII (those are excellent ones). If you can't help yourself, rent this one and see if you like it or not."
3,"ok game, i dont see why everyone hates it.","this game is just ok i would not say great, but i wouldnt say its bad. they sort of destroyed the game by trying to make it more like ff7, but its ok."
2,Really bad if u ask me,"Okay okay, the long wait of FF8 is finally here, but this game is a big dissapointment. I must say that the graphics are really good but the storyline and junctioning gets confusing. Instead of buying a new weapon, u would have to get parts to upgrade it which is really hard, and where's the armor? And i don't know if it's just me but when i was trying to get EDEN i could never ever beat those monsters. i tried like 10 times and i kept on dying. i am looking forward to the next Final Fantasy game"
4,"Sing along on the train, the beach, or wherever!","Watch out if you are easily addicted to silly German songs! This CD will get you singing along as you listen to it all the way through for the millionth time. There is some risque humor but otherwise a classic comedy album, with great hits like ""Mief!"" and ""Moebel Model"". Written and performed by two of Germany's funniest comedians for teenage German students everywhere, a must-have for lovers of Dr. Demento!"
1,Rehashed newspaper articles,"No new revelations here. This story has been told in earlier books, and with more ground breaking impact. This is a case of the publisher hoping to capitalize on a big business story, but too late !! See earlier books on the Microsoft antitrust case, such as The Microsoft File."
4,Good option for medium to heavy home use,"i purchased this being exclusively for it versatility when doing dumbbell workouts. It fits the bill perfectly since it has a nice adjustment range for incline & decline. When using heavier dumbbells (50 lb+), my attention is not distracted by a wobbly unstable bench. My only complaint would be the assembly time. You can expect to spend at least 1.5 hours getting it all together, but I feel the bench is worth the price."
4,Not Free SF Reader,"Class war is part-time for some.The main character here is an academic, but also a part-time soldier, who assists in fighting wars by proxy against the third-world to ensure that their use of nanotech doesn't affect the profits of wealthier nations.He is researching cosmology in a big way on top of that, so is where the action is in many cases, as a large scale project in the outer solar system has his input.3.5 out of 5"
4,A great look at the broadening capacity for fellowship,"I was tempted to give this 5 stars, because Haldeman's exploration of fellowship, first amongst the tight-knit members of the platoon, and later amongst those civilians who spend time jacked into each other's minds, is excellent. However, on reflection, I do have to admit that the ending could have been stronger. Regardless, a weaker Haldeman book is still a cut above 99% of the rest of SF out there. Check it out."
3,It's okay...,"...but I wasn't really thrilled with it. Some interesting concepts introduced, but that's a about all."
2,Weak,"Haldeman tries to convince us that if we could all just feel what every other person feels, there would be no more war, no more poverty, etc. You get the feeling that you're reading a novella-length version of John Lennon's ""Imagine"". Unfortunately, he elides the portions of the book that might be most interesting - what happens to people who are just evil and cannot be incorporated into his magical fairy land? Overall, it just comes off as some sort of half-baked hippie dream. I strongly recommend that you skip this one and read instead Haldeman's ""The Forever War""."
2,Not in the same class as The Forever War!,Don't look here for another classic of the caliber of The Forever War. This is just another uninspired book among many that are out there. The soilderboy concept has promise but it was never developed in a way that captures the imagination.
4,Bring down the barriers. Joe Haldeman second best is out!,"Haldeman "" Forever War"" took the 10 for the best in science fiction. His new book ""Forever Paeace"" comes in a close second. Itunique characters bring to life different attitudes of the world. Julian is a deep thinking character with a troubled mind. It also shows the barriers of the human mind and how it works. This is a book worth reading."
2,"I am, He is...I think?","Pick up this book and be prepared for an agonizing game of mental ping-pong as you're jerked back and forth from first person to third person narrative. The effect isn't thought provoking or stimulating, just fatiguing.This puzzling narrative style adds insult to injury as the premise starts off promisingly, but halfway through, when the protagonist faces his imminent self-confrontation, the storyline unravels in a flurry of laughable plot twists.I have now officially given up on Science Fiction -- thank you Mr. Haldeman."
3,"Interesting, but..................................","This story was highly entertaining. However, I was unhappy with how the story dealt with the supposed political situation. The mind-computer interfacing technology was extremely intriguing but I didn't get a genuine feeling for how it realy worked. The writing style was good. Considering the competition for the Hugo, I wonder what I missed that put it over the top."
2,The book that will become a movie -- a bad movie,"I am a huge fan of Joe Haldeman, but was very disappointed by this book. Haldeman's earlier works, such as Mindbridge and Forever War are great stories told by a great storyteller. His latest works have been less than great stories and definitely not written like the storyteller he once showed us to be. This book, Forever Peace, reads like a movie, and I very much expect it will be picked up. It has all the pointless violence and gory detail that a movie needs, with lots of room for cool special effects. I am sure that Haldeman intended the violence to make a point, and be realistic, but unlike other good ""war"" stories, the violence in this book did not enhance the plot; it hindered it."
2,Too scattered to be entirely useful,"This book seems like a great idea -- jump into following more commandments, one at a time. So why don't I like it? Well, because there *are* connections between the various mitzvot, and this book ignores them.A very wise rabbi once said to me, ""There are only two correct answers to a question about whether you follow a particular mitzvah: 'yes"" and 'not yet'."" This book seems like it addresses this very issue: how does one begin? But the book focuses on each individual piece of halakhah as though it exists in isolation, which of course, none of it does. The book feels very scattered, distractingly so.So if you are looking for a way to start practicing any particular mitzvah, this book may help you with suggestions for how to start at a walk, rather than running flat-out. But if you want a road map to a more observant life, you will find it lacking in a cohesive approach, or plan."
3,kids mouse,"I purchased the kidz mouse for my grandson who just turned 3...it was easy to install, I like the fact that I can use my mouse along with his to help him guide it properly...he still has to use two hands, one to click the other to hold it steady...it has a tendency to slide around easily...I think the cord should have been placed in the back of the mouse not the front, it is a bit cumbersom for him to use and he gets a little frustrated...I will not purchase another one..."
1,a mouse from 1997!,"Very disappointed in this product. The product I ordered said it was USB adaptable. The one I recieved was capatable with windows 97! This product is over 14 years old! So to say the least, it was not compatable with my windows XP laptop. So now I have a mouse that my daughter can't use. She was very upset (she's 3) and doesn't understand why it won't work."
4,Great mouse for a 3 yr old!,"This is a great mouse for the little hands of my 3 yr old daughter. She likes the ""froggy mouse"" as she calls it and I like that you can program it to recognize both buttons as a left button press. This is done with additional software you have to download from the Kidzmouse website at [...]. They don't say whether the software is Vista compatible, but it works for me - you just have to make sure that Vista doesn't block it from starting up. I would recommend this mouse to any parent looking for a mouse for smaller hands.UPDATE 2/9/09 - The mouse driver DOES NOT work on Vista 64-bit versions."
5,Wimshurst Machine and other wonderful information,This is a must buy book for the electrical experimenter and science/physics educator. Very well written with unusual and unexpected material. Beautifully illustrated. Great plans for Wimshurst machine to make 14 inch sparks! Kinetic gravity and countergravitation experiments/information and more!
5,El gran Glenn Gould,Una excelente grabación y una gran interpretación del legendario pianista. Para los fans de Bach y de Gould esta grabación es indispensable.
3,So-So,"Purchased when I had the lawn hydroseeded. Did not extend very far, and if any other hose got turned on at the same time, this did not rotate at all. Ok for small areas only. Had no directions or warranty information included in it. Would not buy again."
2,Disappointed,"This sprinkler has three nozzles for near, medium, and far spray coverage. Unfortunately, the spray from each nozzle is too narrow, so there are gaps between the areas covered. As a result, you get rings of spray coverage (watered grass) separated by rings of no spray coverage (dry grass).Also, this sprinkler is relatively big, and its bright coloring makes it stand out against the lawn.Orbit sells a much smaller compact rotor / gear drive sprinkler, which provides better spray distribution, and is less expensive. Max distance is about the same, which is mostly dependant on your water pressure."
2,Not a happy gilmour,Does not have must water pressure when connect together with another Gimour Turbine sprinkler. The range of the sprinkler changes by itself and ends up water the road more than the yard. Water leak out of the sprinkler head.
3,Should of converted to blu-ray,"I love this series, but, it just does not look too good on my 1080P HD setup.When is BBC going to wake up and upgrade these great features onto blu-ray 1080P??"
4,"Really good, not great, but really good:","These are really good, but not great books. There is suspense, intrigue, both plots are wonderful, the sex was hot, the stories move well and the dialogue is good, if not Elizabethan. This, however, is probably a good thing, since Elizabethan writings are usually difficult to decipher. So, for me what stopped these books from reaching greatness is how sex was used in the storyline. Lady Clio caught on a little to fast to the intricacies of sex, or she is the world's fastest study. I also felt Lady Tuesday made the change from: what a horrible person- to the bed very fast. In fairness though: a quick change of emotions is one of my pet peeves. If this type of rapid emotional change doesn't bother you, the books will rate as great, for me they rate really good. ..."
1,Junk,"I bought this in a kit. Had it for two years but rarely used it. First job with a good many baseboards and it snapped -- stopped firing. Would wind up but nothing shot. Took it in for service. Guy told me they're garbage, sees them all the time, can't fix them at the Dewalt service center. You have to pay $200 and mail it in. If they fix it for less than that, which is unlikely, they'll refund the difference. This gun is heavy and does not get into tight spaces. The upside is obvious -- no compressor. Great idea, but it's junk. I put mine on the front lawn. It was gone the next day."
4,Fuji Film SM05 Accessory Starter Kit,"I really like the camera bag that came with this kit though I would prefer a little more room so I could store extra batteries, digital media cards, and the USB cord all in the pocket. The kit came with a charging base and a couple of rechargable batteries also. I would have prefered that it come with the power cord for the camera also, this would save more in the long run when it comes to battery time. You use more battery power when uploading pictures than any other time. All in all it was a great buy."
1,Batteries kaput,The case for the camera is very nice. The second part of the shipment - the batteries and charger was'nt. The batteries were so swolen that they could not fit in the camera; the charger didn't work with rechargeable batteries I already had.
3,Don't Worry About The Government,"Stephen King (writing as Richard Bachman) tackles the anti-hero with Bart Dawes, who paves a path to self-destruction through a series of deviant actions that - in his mind - may prevent a highway from paving over his home.The psychology of Dawes is painted by King in rich colors that become more and more smeared as his goal becomes more focused, yet more ridiculously unobtainable.That Dawes is driving himself down a dead-end road - with the guidance of several others - ultimately makes the mind games quite silly. But the novel keeps a decent pace for 307 pages and is a nice detour from the typical terrain traversed by King."
3,Not his best work but still an enjoyable read!,"Having recently read the novel i can give an honest account! I am an avid Stephen King reader, even if this is by Bachman, i still found it a little bit of a struggle to perceiver with this one. It is slow, and a bit boring! But still, dispite this King is a great Author and this should not put you of his work! Certain areas of the book are great but the ending was too predictable for my liking!"
4,"Good Insight, not enough history",This is a great book if you want to hear the tales of the founders of karate. If you are looking to this book however to be a fact based history book then this is not for you.
3,the waponless warriors: An informal history of Okinawan Karate,"I have not read it yet, however I expected better quality used paper back. I need more time, presently reading other material."
1,Terrible Broiler Pan - everything sticks,"I bought this and used it twice - washed it, or tried to wash it immediately. Forgettaboutit.Everything sticks.Ridiculous. DO NOT BUY!"
1,Not recomended,I couldn't clean it. I threw it our 2 days after I received it. I broiled a steak and the grease was baked on and I couldn't get it off.
3,It works for a time,"It's very hard to clean and it doesn't last forever. I'm about to order my third in about 7 years. The size is great when cooking for one or two, though, and I just don't see broiler pans in the stores anymore, at least in the small city where I live. I wish I could find something better, but this product will do for now."
3,it does the job,"I have to agree with others who have reviewed this product, the finish prevents you from getting the broiler pan clean. Otherwise the shape and size of this pan is perfect when cooking for two. Maybe if I had taken the advise of another reviewer and sprayed the pan with cooking spray before I put it under the broiler it would have made a difference. Too late now."
5,Love it!,"I just bought it and have already used it. It's heavier than I thought. I have cooked ribs, steaks and neither time did it warp. Would recommend this for anyone who likes to broil."
2,"sturdy, but hard to clean","This is definitely a sturdy piece of equipment. Very solid. However, I do not understand in what universe this could be considered ""non-stick"". Believe me, if you cook something with BBQ sauce on it in this pan, you will NEVER be able to get this thing clean. My new strategy will be to use foil over top. Hope that works better."
4,Very readable,"This covers the history of the Rolling Stones using quotes from media interviews. The book is over 400 pages and is organised by date so if you're interested in, say, the death of Brian Jones you can go to that date and read all the band comments. It's not really ""off the record"" though, because all the comments are from the media. Maybe that's the alternative style or maybe ""in their own words"" was copyrighted by someone else. You get the impression after reading it that they created themes themselves, eg, is this your last tour? That's been going around since the early Seventies. It's an enjoyable read though."
2,"""You're caught in a Temporal Paradox!""","A World Peace conference is in jeopardy! World War III is imminent. Mercinaries from the future are here to kill Sir Reginald Styles, and how are the Daleks tied into it? Not too bad, the regulars are good, which makes it a shame that the Daleks aren't! The Ogrons are more fun to watch in this story, as the Daleks barely even leave there cubby at their headquarters. The time paradox idea is the only thing that really saves this one. Location footage isn't that bad, and the story is, at least, interesting. Who fans had to wait a long time for the Daleks to come back since ""Evil.."", and they would have to wait more, since the next ""decent"" Dalek story wouldn't make its appearance until ""Genesis..."". It doesn't even feel like a true Dalek story. Tolerable."
2,Not one of the better Dalek stories,"I anxiously ""popped"" this video into my VCR (having not seen it in almost 10 years!) and was a little disappointed. I thought the main story was good. But it was almost like the Daleks were just ""Thrown in"". This story didn't need them, and frankly would have done better without them. It was rumored that the Daleks were actually added after the original script was done, just to make it a little more flashy. Unfortunatley, it all ended up in a little overkill. If you want a truly wonderful Dalek story, check out GENESIS OF THE DALEKS, OR DESTINY OF THE DALEKS...your money would be better spent."
3,Destiny Delivers Disapointing Davros,"Don't get me wrong. I throughly enjoyed this video. However it pales in conparision to the story it sequels ""Genesis of the Daleks"". Michael Wisher gave a chilling perforance as the evil creator of the Daleks in ""Genesis"", but here Davros' chair wobbles, the mouth doesn't move and David Gooderson, who I'm sure is a fine actor, just doesn't capture the character of Davros as well as the originator of the role. That aside, however, I found the story quite enjoyable, and there were some decent special effects, considering this is Dr. Who and was made in 1979. I'd give 3 and a half stars, but I can't do that, and I don't think it deserves four."
3,Why can't they have exterminated K9?,"That ridiculous robot dog which became the bane of the Tom Baker era and must have alienated a lot of the adult audience is thankfully only briefly seen here. There's a good script and some genuinely memorable moments, but all too often a story is let down by its execution, and that's what's happened here. The Daleks and the absence of K9 make the adventure better than most of the stories in an era noted for its campness and weak stories, but the Davros here is nowhere near as sinister as the 'Genesis of the Daleks' version, his voice completely different and his chair quite obviously built for someone of a different height and build. An entertaining story, okay if you don't expect too much."
2,Not impressed,"I purchased this book for my boyfriend, who is Swedish, and I thought we could make some of the recipes together. However, we found that the recipes were either very unhealthy (contained ridiculous amounts of butter and cream) or were very complicated to prepare, so we haven't used it much. The recipes in the cookbook are not so much classic Swedish dishes, but more interpretations of Swedish dishes for a fancy restaurant. So if your goal is making some fancy Swedish-style food this might be for you."
5,Great easy to hook-up trailer rear light kit !,"Very easy to read wiring instructions enclosed.Easy to mount to trailer.Very visible at night , and can be seen during the day ."
3,as good as some; better than most,"I enjoyed Dr. Who #1's quirky qualities, displayed to the fullest in this video. Ian and Barbara do an excellent job here, too. Interesting viewpoint of the Aztec society!"
4,Plainly An Episode From A Kid's Show,"When Doctor Who first debuted on BBC, it was intended as a kid's show. Two of the Doctor's companions were teachers, a science teacher and a history teacher, and the third was a high-school student. The shows alternated between travels to the past, where the history teacher could explain things, and the future, where the science teacher had rein.This is one of the historical episodes, and one of the few set in the Americas. The crew of the TARDIS travels to Aztec Mexico and gets separated from their craft. In the effort to get back where they came from, one of their number gets mistaken for a resurrected demigod and takes it upon herself to change the course of history, over the Doctor's objections. Not Hartnell's best episode, but without a doubt worth taking a look at."
1,Rechargeable Dud!!,"I bought this charger from an Amazon seller for my Kodak KLIC-8000 rechargeable battery and it didn't recharge my battery at all. I followed directions on the back of the box. The red status light came on but neither the red or green charge indicator came on. I charged the battery at home for about four hours, tried it in my camera and didn't work. Took the charger to work charged there for about eight hours. Still no charge. I guess you do need the generic battery in order for this to work."
2,Dissapointing,"More trivial than insightful. Had some great moments of wit, but as a whole is fractured and disjointed. Could have used a good editor."
3,Please get the terminology right!,"Throughout reading this, I was bothered repeatedly by one major error: she frequently uses vagina when she means VULVA! It makes me cringe that a play dedicated to freeing women from shame about this most intimate of body parts can't even name it correctly.I also didn't really connect with the monologues and no doubt that's because they were meant to be seen performed, not read. I would probably only buy this if I had already seen and enjoyed a performance.So why 3 stars and not fewer? It's an acknowledgment of the positive impact Eve Ensler's play has had worldwide bringing women's experiences (some funny, some horrific) out into the open. She has also used the Monologue's huge success to initiate campaigns against violence towards women. Which is a good thing. (I'm aware that this means that I'm bringing in factors other than the text for my rating - just call it female solidarity)."
1,Loony Tunes,I don't know about his book but I do know that he really doesn't exist. He's just a cartoon character.
4,Gallifreyan intrigue again,"A good Davison episode of Who, with the focus on intrigue within the Time Lords as one of the High Council attempts to bring Omega back to the matter universe. The Amsterdam bit is a bit weak, but this is probably the best Doctor/Nyssa episode. Davison's reaction at the end to Tegan's return is priceless!"
4,Social Welfare,"The product was new, in good condition except for a small area on one corner as if it had been dropped.The book was received in the time frame expected and specified during the ordering process. There was no disappointing change in ship date after confirmation."
4,"Misleading Title, But Still Incredible","Rosen lies to you right from the start. In hindsight, maybe that's because he's writing a book about buzz. Where he lies is the title--this is not about creating word-of-mouth advertising.Rather, Rosen traces the whole ""buzz"" movement throughout much of the past ten years, from Blair Witch (a standardized cliche) to Hotmail to Napster. He traces how they grew to the point where everyone knew about them, leading to their phenomenal growth and success.If you want actual strategies, then go with Levine's Guerrilla Pr: Wired, which is more interested in how-tos than what-ises.Rosen is still good, though, and it's enjoyable to see how these famous concepts and products developed. This book provides some excellent case histories and blueprints for some rather (in)famous products. Well-written, it makes for fascinating reading, but, as I said, don't expect to learn how to market your the electronic hammer (copyrighted to Homer Simpson in Springfield) in this one."
3,"Read as a complement to ""The Tipping Point""","Emanuel Rosen's 'Anatomy of Buzz' has some worthwhile stuff about what he calls 'information hubs,' those people who seem to know more about certain subjects and make it their business to pass the word to the rest of us. However, Malcom Gladwell dissected this phenomenon in great detail in his outstanding work, ""The Tipping Point."" Gladwell tells us that the Hub persona is actually comprised of three different indivduals: mavens, connectors and salesmen. You don't really get down to that level of detail here.Not to say Rosen's book is without merit. I was fascinated by Gladwell's research and thought 'Buzz' would be a good complement to that. With those expectations, I enjoyed the book and found it to be a worthwhile read. I'll keep it on my bookshelf (for me, that's the litmus test of a book's worth)."
4,Awesome,I liked a lot. I strongly recommended and specially to people who have never heard before about word of mouth.
5,Wonderful book to learn XForms,"Easy reading and a good explanation of XForms concepts. The book is about 230 pages with a CD. The XForms concepts are very well compressed into these pages, making it easy reading, yet less intimidating. I was able to read most of the book in the car when we went on a trip to Maine."
1,Candyland,"This is one of the most appaling books I have ever read. It has not one redeeming feature, and I find it amazing that it found a publisher even though written by well known author(s)"
1,This was awful; a complete waste of time,"I have previously been very satisfied reading books by Evan Hunter; so I thought I would be pleased reading the combo novel. What a disappointment. I couldn't wait to finish; even thought of just stopping. Stories seem too disjointed; could tell that there were two different writers. I wondered if it was even the same story. I figured it might be a ""Law & Order"" type breakout but was sadly disappointed."
1,No Stars,"In this book the one author/two styles combine into one dirty old man with no style. What was the point of all this; no suspense, no real characters, only wishful thinking. Stupid stupid - and I usually enjoy his books. Carella where are you?"
3,"Good product, a little short","I bought this to mount my computer between my aerobars and while it fits my space, my computer is a little big for this. If you have a ""larger"" computer, which mine is not that big, then you may not have enough space to mount it to this nob."
5,History and Mystery,"For a pathologist, he is an excellent writer. It is story and history combined and melds well with the subsequent century that Michael Jecks writes about regarding ""Crowners and bailiffs."" I regard both as good writers, which is an understatement."
2,Don't waste your money.,"As with several study guides that follow a successful book, it seems more like a way to make more $$ than really be a good guide. It might work as a personal study guide, but for a group it's not good. If you're going to do it personally, just study the book and take notes. Why do you need a guide?"
3,The behind the seens with bizzy is good but the rest can be trashed,"I knew I would not like most if it because I hate watching live performances, but I bought for the behind the scenes and when Bizzy raps he is being funny, and that is pretty cool. I do not know the two dorky dudes with him are but they are annoying. and the behind the scenes should of been easier to find it is just put in randomly and not able to get to by scene selection, but I love Bizzy's music so it was worth buying."
3,"An interesting book, copiously researched but sadly lacking.","While copiously researched, Tosches does little to show us why or how Dean Martin became the distant, disenchanted, and uninvolved person he was. Perhaps this is the reason Tosches takes far too much liberty in donning the persona of Martin--to attempt to spice up and shock the reader with thoughts or words he claims were Martin's view of his world. Tosches would have done better to do a few more penetrating interviews of Martin's contemporaries, friends, and families to show us the real story here, rather than telling us his interpretation of it. Lacking too, were Martin's own words. While this is an unauthorized biography, certainly Martin gave more interviews than indicated in the text."
2,Echoes of Flippo....,"Why spend so much time and energy piling up every erratic fact that others have done the legwork for.....just throwing them in there in the worlds most superfluous concoction....as if that isnt bad enough, and than taking all these liberties to interject what your subject, in this case Dino, is thinking?!? I hate that!IF you have ever read somethign Chet Flippo wrote....and wanted to gag(because he just makes things us and shoves them in his books like they are facts.....dialogue....intimate moments....blech), then you may find this milder but gobbled up jabberwocky to be tedious.I read it. I expect more from Tosches. HE is brilliant when he wants to be. He lazied out on this one."
5,excellent,"No one in my area sell this product and it is a must have product, so I was glad to be able to find in on line. I now know that I can order it with no problems."
4,Here's How to Fix the XP Problem !!,"OK, This is a great program for kids, but VERY FRUSTRATING since (as mentioned by other reviewers already) it doesn't work under Windows XP.I did some web surfing and finally found the solution. (First go ahead and install the program even though you'll probably get an error message and then it won't work). One reviewer mentioned http://www.disneyinteractive.com/supportbut I didn't find the answer there. Surprisingly, I found it at a Gateway support site:http://support.gateway.com/s/issues/667633911.shtmlThis explains the problems and points you to the following download: ftp://ftp.gateway.com/pub/hardware_support/gw-sold_apps/games/7512455.exe If you run this it will extract 2 files to C:\Cabs\7512455, including DMASUpdate.exe. When you finally run DMASUpdate.exe it will fix the problem and you will then be able to use Disney Magic Artist Studio under WinXP (and your kids will be verrrrry happy !)."
2,"Robin Hood, Illustrated by N.C. Wyeth","The front part of the book is separated from spine. There are a few front pages missing.I taped it up as it is usable, just not as nice a copy as described. I have purchased severalof these vintage copies through Amazon, and they are all great. This one is scratchedup and the sides of the pages are nearly brown."
4,I read Gu Cheng's book last night.,"There was Taiphone last night in Shenzhen.I lied in bed and read the book ""ying'er""by Gu Cheng.The story just like some memory deep inside your heart.The sunshine and the sweetness of flowers.The murmur of life and love.The rhymn of death.I can't say anything what I know about Gu Cheng in focous,but I really recepted something."
5,an attractive version,"This is a good clear colourful sounding 1959 stereo recording. At first the performance sounded a bit Italian, but the main three singers are Germanic, and that impression soon disappeared. The saxophone is particularly pleasing here. I like this version and am very happy to have it beside my DG Bohm."
1,not even one star,crap! I was extremely disapointed. The girl isn't very easy to pay attention too. She got on my nerves. Then it turns into a porn at the end. I wasn't expecting that! I trashed it.
4,A good way to explain how to make life at work more fun,The book explains in a story telling manner as to how one can make life at work more interesting and fun. The authors have kept the language extremely simple. I have seen a lot of individuals in office who just dont care anymore and hate every minute of their life at work. Not only do they harm their career in this manner but they affect the moods of more enthusiastic people. I wish they read this book and learned its philosophy. It would make everyones life better.Dont expect that reading the book will do wonders for your life though. Try to put in practice what the book preaches and you will be a happier individual.Another good book to read is Don't Sweat the Small Stuff at work by Richard Carlson.
3,Simple yet true,"While the ideas seem to be relevent the story behind it is boring and cheesy. But what can you expect from a parable book? I think it is basically the same book that has been writen a hundred times before. I hear the movie is better, but I don't feel I wasted an hour of my life on a completely pointless book. I think the ideas of choosing an attitude and focusing on your customer can help anyone out in any kind of business. But did it need to be packaged in a $14 book?"
1,Another Joke on Corporate America,"I honestly think that this work is a satire on the American workplace. It describes a Fish Market and how the lessons learned there apply to corporate America. Having implemented this program at my company, I know first hand that the solutions dreamed up by employers and employees alike have little effect on the company. The book's title has become a code word for meaningless programs through out the company.If you want to wallow in the current state of employment, go read Dilbert. If you want to change your company look elsewhere. If you want to have a good laugh you might buy this book."
2,FISH,The FISH book is great. Unfortunately you sent us the compact disc audio version which is not as effective as a motivational tool. We are in the process of returning them to you and ordering a large supply of the books for our business.
3,Cheesy even by my standards,"I know Seattle. I lived on the Olympic Peninsula most of my life and have been to Pike's Place market and seen the fish-throwers many times. The dialogue in the book doesn't depict the way people truly speak. The whole thing sounds like an infomercial (i.e. ""How can I get excited about work again and reinvent my job so I don't think of it as a toxic energy dump?"" ""Well, Bob, let me show you how in 5 easy steps . . . "").I found the book much too commercial for my standards, especially when the point of the book is to break out of the norm and try a non-traditional tactic in the workplace."
1,Disappointed,I was very disappointed in this book - more management fluff. It's just not that simple to change the way people work and motivate them as stated in this book in today's day and age.
1,Don't Take the Bait!,"Having fun at work...a great concept, but Lundin's book is meant for a 5th grade mind, not a fully functional adult. The theory behind the book is relevant but Lundin's delivery is all too simplified and doesn't have practical application of how to do this. And what's more, Lundin gets hired to go to big corporations to throw FISH dolls around for $1000's of dollars. The problem is that he's there for a half day and once he's gone, the fish dolls gather dust.If you want to change your workplace, it takes more than throwing a stuffed fish doll around. You have to have a set of values that honors people and find ways to execute on those values EVERY day.But you have to give Lundin credit, he's made an empire out of books meant for elementary school as well as over-priced workshops and DVDs that all say the same message.But if you're a smart and intelligent leader, bypass this simpleton text and do some research over at the Harvard Business Review...."
3,"It's motivational, but a little too simplistic","I've ordered this book because it was a professional organization book club's choice for this month. It was an easy, fun read, a bit overly simplistic, but for busy folks working in large organizations it may be a great way to boost morale and improve organizational climate."
3,Interesting though not very innovative,"The book presents some plain facts about how to boost morale in an organization. It's true that it helps you clarify the basics of people handling, but don't expect to find an in-depth analysis or innovative research on the subject."
4,You be the Judge,"I was very excited when the book arrived. I had heard many stories about the fish market in Seattle. When the book arrived I was a little diappointed when I realized that it was only about 100 pages. I got passed it.The book reads fast. The story moves a long, although somewhat predictable. The ideas and concepts shared in the book are very useful and have changed my opinion about my workplace. I now arrive to work much happier, I get along with co-workers much better and fell as though they are a part of my team.It's a good book to pick up and read when you are feeling like you are stuck with no place to turn in your job."
5,Fish is going to the top!,"If you haven't got Fish yet, get it now. First, if you're involved in any organization this book will point the way to a whole new world of success. Second, Fish is going to be a classic and your First Edition is going to sell for a fortune some day! Click it into your shopping cart now. You'll be glad you did."
2,"Another work in the tiring ""parable style"".","Is anyone else getting tired of this style of books? With three or four ideas wrapped into a cute but not particularly well-written story, I found myself skipping through the book and looking for the main ideas in larger print (the main ideas are almost always in larger print in this writing style). The principles are great, but why write a trite book to illustrate them? There's not much here to make you think, and it is a shame that there are so many of these books on the market that are vying for your time and money. If you are required to read this book, borrow it from someone else for a half hour, or better yet, read it while you stand in their office."
1,Business Book?,This book does not belong among business books. Really quite silly. Won't do a thing to improve your business. Look around - there really are research based books out there.
3,Something boring this way comes,"I really liked ""Very Mercenary"", so I was disappointed when I put this disc in, only to find that the technical wizardry so prevalent on VM is lacking here. In fact, it's non-existant. Every single song ends with you suddenly remembering that you're listening to music. It just falls into the background, where I guess it belongs. Don't get me wrong. It isn't bad music. It's just nothing special. Rip it from a friend, but don't waste your hard earned money on it like I did. I miss my money."
2,Just Call Me Al,"After reading this book I have concluded Albert Gore is quite possibly the most arrogant politician since Richard Nixon. The country is lucky he was not president, hopefuly Bush will do better than previously predicted, allowing opportunities for true public servents rather than know it alls like Mr. Gore."
1,Very Bad Customer Service from BigTrends,i bot the book and later subscribed to its Bigtrends newsltter service and i had the worst experience ever in my whole trading career. I wrote to them several times for problems i had in its service and i received no replies. They charged me upfront for thousands of dollars and no refund despite cancellations after two weeks.This is one newsletter that i would not recommend...trust me ! there is no customer service at all !!
5,Learn how to create an environment that honors intuition!,"The author has written such a beautiful book - filled with information, tools, reflections, and ""exercises"" -sure to help you (and your child) expand your awareness of intuition as well as how to embrace and share those ""gut feelings"". My favorite tool in this book was learning how when I'm apart from loved ones, I can imagine a protective light surrounding them, that keeps them safe and sends them my love. This book is truly a powerful, nurturing guide. Enjoy!"
3,Permission Marketing in a basic easy read,"This book is better than Seth's previous books and a good summary for those looking to get the quick and quite possibly ""only"" overview of permission marketing. Previous critics of Seth's work as ""too basic"" and ""too flat"" will see a maturity in his writing that makes this an enjoyable and worthwhile read."
3,All right for those inexperienced in marketing...,"but if you have experience in marketing, don't bother with this book. In Permission Marketing, the author takes a lot of OLD marketing concepts, renames them, and presents the concepts as if they were new. All right if you are an engineer w/o marketing experience, but if you have marketing experience and a brain, don't waste your time or money."
2,No news,"While Godin does a good job retelling an old story about properly targeting, utilizing appropriate messaging and benefiting from modern (post-internet) media, it is not new. Some of his retelling is convoluted in endless metaphores. And, as this book was written before 9/11 and the dot-bomb, much of it is out-of-date and of reduced relevance.There are more helpful and current books out there about internet and other direct-marketing topics."
3,It was OK...,"It was useful in that it helped me think a about customer communications as a string of relationship building activities. However, the point probably could have been made in a dozen pages or less. It was pretty repetitive. Also, I found the book to have a lot of inconsistencies like stressing a long-term relationship with customers in a short-term context of ""buying"" desired customer behaviors."
3,"Old, but still relevant, introduction to direct marketing","This book was written in 1999, but surprisingly still completely relevant today. The examples are a bit dated, but since it's a conceptual book, the reader will get a good basic introduction to the concept behind opt-in email and direct response marketing.I recommend this book to beginners with no experience with direct marketing or opt-in email marketing knowledge. Although very well written and in a very readable tone, experienced marketers or those with the basic knowledge of marketing will find the book a bit boring and repetitive. For more advance readers, I suggest No B.S. Direct Marketing by Dan Kennedy.I would give the book a higher rating as an introduction to direct marketing if it were edited down by about 1/3 its size due to repetition in the book otherwise it's a good book."
3,"Good, but it could have been better.","Battlefield is the opening story for Doctor Who's 26th season, and in all respects, it's not half bad. Jean Marsh is impressive as Morgaine, and Nicholas Courtney is superb in his last return role as the Brigadier. The plot is original, but in overall analasys a tad silly. The characters of Mordred and Ancelyn are predictable, and the two regulars, McCoy and Aldred, do little that amazes. However, the Destroyer is a stunning success. The animatronic movements are masterful, but I have to complain, why was it kept out of view for all of three episodes? Bessie's return is totally welcome (although the registration has magically changed from WHO 1 to WHO 7) and the overall feel is good. A worthy addition to a Doctor Who fan's collection. END"
1,What a waste of paper.,I can't believe I spent any money on this book. It's justa rehashing of stuff on various websites out there.
3,Shows how debt affects net worth,The very good chapter here on determining your net worth helps emphasize the effect of debt on your planning and projections.Michael Pellecchia
5,Dr. Deming's Management Principles- a Charming Illustration,"I read this book five years ago, when I was a manager leading a small company about 15 people. I honour management style that respect human nature. Deming's priciples presented in this book give me a systematic insight of the principles based on mutual trusting and respect. I used his approach -- our company makes good profit -- and more important, all the staff enjoy working in our company."
4,F.... Good Tribute to Norway's best black metal band....,This is one of the best tribute cds I ever hear to tribute a band and this is not just a band for Christ Sakes!!!! is Mayhem so if You got the chance to get it dont let it go for me the best song on this album is Limbonic Art cover Der Mysteriis Dom Sathanas is 5 of 5.
1,Want a good nights sleep?,"This book was so so dull. It was actually painful to read.It did however work nicely as a sleep aid.As it was for a class, it didn't matter if I liked it or not, I still had to read it. Total snore fest."
3,really good soundtrack,"This was a really good soundtrack and a really good buy. I went to my nearby record store to get it the day it came out, and it is a really good c.d. Even though it is full of remixes, in which I liked most of the originals better, it was still a really good c.d. The Ill Nino remix was really good. I don't know if anybody else had this problem, but there aren't any Parental Advisory versions of this c.d., I don't think, and when I bought mine, it was edited, so that was kind of disappointing. I still give it three stars though. Probably would have had 4 or 5 if it wasn't edited."
3,...........,"first and foremost, i would like to announce i only downloaded this album because of the rammstein track, which has absolutly NOTHING to do with the plot of the livine dead. (the song is in fact about an overly realigous zealot who, in the end, begins to molest young boys as ""punishment"" for their ""sins"") slipknot is a band that i dont care for, but their songs arent bad. the same goes for the many songs and remixes by manson. i was also severely disapointed by the editing of swearing and any other material considered blasphamous. overall, this album is quite strange."
5,Scary but outstanding,"It has the element of fear in each song, so I expect it to fit the movie in a proper way.Another good metal music related soundtrack."
2,Is That All There Is?,"I was hoping this would be a really great CD since I heard so many good things about Ms. Jenkins. However, I found it mediocre at best. Thereis a hard edge to her voice that hurts my ears. The best piece was the one that was the duet with Kiri Te Kanawa, and I hate opera. If only Ms. Jenkins had the softness of Kiri Te Kanawa's voice..then she would be great. Mezzo is a bit lower range, but it can be softer and easier on the ear..ie Fredericka Von Stade, Anne Howells etc."
4,Dominating the Doctor,"Great little story with Troughton displaying his inimmitable style.Troughton is the best Dr and this is an entertaining 5 parter that shows Troughton off as a mixed bag of fun and fear.The story sees dastardly dominators who aim to destroy a planet with a nuclear bomb in order to fuel their star fleet.The Doctor, with Jamie and new recruit Zoe manage to thwart their plans but not without a great deal of team work and action. With Jamie out and about exploding Quarks the Dominators is an entertaining tale to the end."
5,Justin Sane,"ok, look, lets face it, Justin Sane has it all, hes got talent, thats all you need. Hes an awesome guitarist, and a vocal writer that is excellent and expresses his feeling for the US government strongly. He is a leader in Anti-Flag, which is my favorite band. But this Cd may be one of my all time high's. I love it, but i have to warn you THIS SOUNDS NOTHING LIKE ANTI-FLAG. well your probably saying to yourself right now, well duh, its a solo album, with a guitar and vocals, it cant possibly sound fast and hardcore like Anti-Flag, well in some songs it could like the first song entitled ""For Pat"". But most of it is Folk Rock. But it is amazing, the lyric's Sane blasts out is amazing, his fight for world peace rages on in this CD, but also endures the quality of love and life, and his true scene of growing up, being a punk. All in all i would BUY BUY BUY this CD it is worth all your money.Thank you for your time....."
1,Terrible,"This video shows all the worst excesses of the PeterDavison/John Nathan-Turner era of the show: obvious cliffhangers with silly resolutions, a plot that treats big issues in the most superficial way, gratuitous threats from characters whom we really could care less about, and an overall sense of ""it seems weird, it must be science-fiction!"" Buy this one and squirm."
3,Rosemary in Spain,"Quite entertaining but not exactly ""mind blowing"". Just another ""run of the mill! mystery stories. I could not empathise or relate to any of the characters, and Leigh Koslow seemed to me to be a shallow egoist character who had little to endear her to me."
4,How good can free be?,For a free book this was well written with a good story line and ending. Mostly a chick book I think.
3,Incredible outcome,"a ""who dunnit"" that's a quick read and an enjoyable, but one that's a little hard to belive at times."
4,Very good,I'm a mystery book reader . I usually can get who did it by the middle of book. Not with this one. Really enjoyed it.
4,Never Buried its ok,"is a free book... lol i didn't expect something wow, but it is ok, i haven't finished yet but so far it is interesting"
4,Good Book,"The story was well thought out. It had a good mystery and interesting characters. The best thing about it was that even though it was a murder mystery, there was humor in both the story and the dialog between the characters."
4,Good read,"Good story. Well written. Fast read, with good twists and interesting characters. Will read more from this author.Thankfully the grammar and punctuation were correct. Too many books are sorely lacking these days."
5,Really enjoyed,"Had a great plot with a twist. Did not expect the ending and very creative ways of saying, ""Get out"". Great author and rich in vocabulary. Highly recommended to anyone who enjoys mystery. Love it!"
4,Keeps you intrigued,I have never read anything by this author and got it for free. The story was kept me intrigued and I read it in one day. I would definitely recommend this author and would read more.
2,not finished yet,"not very exciting. as far as i can tell, this is NOT a sifi book.. have not decided yet if i will finish it"
4,Great book that takes place in the Pittsburgh area,The books are set in the Pittsburgh area which is why I started reading them. It is a great easy read with an easy to follow plot. Has just enough mystery to keep you reading to see how it all plays out. If you know Pittsburgh and like mysteries then you should like these books.
4,Promising,"A promising debut. The book held my attention, and was the typical mystery I love. However, I was quite distracted by the amateur writing style. Since this is the author's first book, I'm willing to give her more time and have already purchased the other books in the series, but I do hope that as I continue to follow Leigh in her travels, the author's writing style improves."
2,Bit slow off the ground,"This book definitely was not my thing. It started off a bit slow and I found it difficult to keep reading. The main characters were interesting, but not enough to keep me reading. The story line wasn't enough to keep my interest. I didn't finish this book, but I'm sure other people would enjoy it."
4,awesome,Very good book. Keeps you interested in it all the way through. Would like to read more books by Edie claire.
3,Glory to GOD,"I'll give J-P II 3 stars. He lost a star with Pinochet and another with the ""Sandinista incident"" in my book but he still was a pretty good pope when all is said and done."
3,Highwayman bio,Good story lines on all four participants but leaves out some of the more fun things that exist between them.
1,Poor Quality,"The Velcro bottom would not stick to the place I wanted it to. So when I pulled it off, usually took it all off. I think I got the one sitting on the shelf for weeks."
2,does the job,Would have given this a 5 star but the pic showed it to be black and it was white and also amazon begged for this review...privacy ppl????
3,"3.5 Good read, but she's no Stephanie Plume","I initially picked this book up because I adore the Stephanie Plume series. While Dixie Flannigan is no Stephanie Plume, she is still a fallible character than any woman in her 30s or older can relate to. Quit her career for a new one, but it's not exactly her dream job. Has a man, but he's confusing the heck out of her and doesn't like her job. She wrestles with keeping herself so under wraps that she never gets close to people. That's what I like. This was my first Chris Rogers and I will definitely try the next one. Parker, her love interest, is a cad. If he doesn't straighten up and see what a great woman he has and stop trying to change her into what he believes he wants, then he has to go. Maybe kill him off and have Dixie solve the case while meeting the true love of her life..."
3,A Little Daunting,"I found the recipes a little daunting to cook. Having to make the salsas first and then using them in other recipes adds to the time and difficulty, and the recipes seem to require more equipment than my frugal kitchen has. However, once the effort is made, folks find the food delicious."
3,Less Than Expected,"Rick Bayless is probably the biggest inspiration toward the popularity of ""REAL"" or traditional Mexican cooking in the U.S. He has several very popular shows on PBS and is quite active in promoting PBS with live appearances and tours showing how to prepare delicious Mexican food. I was disappointed as I mentioned in my first review of this book, because almost it's entire content including most of the recipes were previously included in his past cook books. The recipes are delicious. Granted.The other problem is the poor binding of this edition. The pages are falling out.If you own Mr Bayless' previous books, you have the contents of this book. I am a fan of Mr Bayless, but I have been disappointed in this endeavor. I used to purchase any item with his byline sight unseen. I will at least thumb through any future cookbooks before future purchase."
3,Beware Poor Binding Quality,"I'd rate this book at 4 stars for the recipes; great flavors that are relatively simple to prepare with a lot of variety. They're presented in a compact, well organized format.Unfortunately, the quality of the books construction merits only 1 star! My copy started losing pages a few days after purchase. I returned it for a replacement but the new copy is no better. The book is of simple glue bound construction and it just won't hold up.Buy a hole punch and a binder to go along with it and you'll own a cookbook that presents a great introduction to Bayless's interesting style."
1,When Does the Laughing Start?,"The content of this book is trite and smacks of someone so self-absorbed with her issues that she thought them worthy for publication. The writing style frustrated me, as it rambles and babbles about the same trials and tribulations that the author faced in life without making any connections for the readers who expected to gain any insight. After I finished the book, all I could think was ""Get Over It!"" I found nothing in the book that would lead me to believe that this author would rather laugh, nor did she provide any insight as to how one can find laughter in the challenges presented by life. Save your money....there are many other inspirational books that will actually have some impact."
1,Insufferable,"The incessant self-regard in this book is cloying. According to Linda, no one has suffered as Linda has suffered, no one's pain has been as challenging a Linda's, no one's effort to overcome her pain has been more inspiring than Linda's. There is something very unwholesome about this attitude.Perhaps the self-pitying navel gazing is the core of her problems. For happiness take the focus off yourself and think of others for a change...for once!"
2,I'd Rather Laugh: How To be happy When Ilfe has other Plans,"The book started out OK, was able to relate to her, but as it continued, she is still self-absorbed with her sad life, self-indulgent - unable to write a check for herself?? Please. And has misinterpreted Harold Kushner's book completely. I don't need someone elses neuroses in my life!"
1,You're probably already too healthy to bother with this,"Perhaps this book can be of some help to some people but I rather doubt it. I think potential readers need to be forewarned that there is very little of subtance in this book. I completely agree with several other reviewers who were bothered by Ms. Richman's continual berating of her dead mother and disconcerted by her questionable behavior, e.g lying to Dixie Carter, money hang-ups, fear of dentistry, etc. While none of us are perfect, few of us profess to be able to tell others how to live.. and get paid for it."
5,Saved My Life,"Linda Richman saved my life. I was depressed after losing a family member of my own. I would spend my days mulling my mistakes and regrets overe and over again in my head. I was unable to get out of the spirral of negative and self ptiful thought. then a friend gave me Linda's book which I (begrudgingly) read and found that not only couldn't I put it down but it made me laugh and then cry with recoginition and then with releif. I can't imagine what would've happened had I not been given that book. Linda, if you're out there...THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU!!!!"
5,Eminem - what more can I say?,"Eminem is the best rapper out there; hands down. I don't care about race, color, creed - he spits like no one else!"
3,Good for slides: only so-so for negatives,"Slide scanning work very well, sharp and clear. Negatives, however were notquite as clear and clean when scanned, even at higher resolutions."
1,Does not work with Mac OS,"Imagine my excitement when I finally find a film scanner (OpticFilm 7200) with such high reviews on the internet, after trying many solutions for digitizing a collection of 5,000+ slides... Only to find out this product cannot support Mac OS. Given the current upswing in market share of Mac products (MacBook and MacBook Pro hold position #7 and 8 on the Bestsellers in Computers & PC Hardware on Amazon as of this review), it is very unfortunate that Plustek has chosen to ignore such a sizable market of creative types whom would benefit from having access to their products...Sad, sad indeed...."
1,Some Good Some Bad,"I do not recommend purchasing this book, especially for highly technical individuals but beginners on SNMP. Either the material is poorly organized or I just don't get the purpose of this book.There are a few helpful pages from the author's experience. But I found myself reading the summary at the end of each chapter and afterwards starting at the beginning of the chapter."
2,what a shame,"i bought this cd and was very disappointed by a skip right at the beginning of ""300pounds of heavenly joy"". i exchanged it for a new one but it was the same. evidently they are all defective from the digital master. i've tried to contact universal but it's near impossible. i recommend waiting to buy this one until the defect is addressed. it's a shame that the utmost care would not be taken in remastering such classic and important recordings."
3,"Good, but Uninvolving","Wand does some nice things with this performance, and the recording captures the sound in a balanced way. The slower tempi allow for a lot of details in the scoring to come through. In general, the piece moves along carefully and deliberately, maintaining flow and instrumental balances. Unfortunately, things sound a little too careful at times, leading to dramatic passages sounding somewhat underplayed and anticlimactic.Part of the problem comes from a brass section that doesn't seem to play through the notes enough. They attack the beginning of the note and then just let it go. It's particularly annoying in the first movement during those recurring descending triplet figures in the low brass. Perhaps the Berlin Phil brass players should listen to the Chicago Symphony brass section and learn how to do it. That orchestra's brass can bring an incredible organ-like quality to the sustained brass lines in Bruckner 4 that makes Berlin's sound seem a little amateurish in comparison."
3,A Little Disappointing,"I was hoping for something a little different. There are only black & white photos/illustrations which are fine, but not great. Other books with color photos are much more user friendly. I have still not figured out exactly how the book is organized. However, all is not lost. As with some of the other glass books I purchased recently, with time, and a lot of patience, I am sure that I can use this book. I would recommend that an in-person examination before buying. Not recommended for the novice collector, like me."
5,So glad to find this book again!,"I bought this book for my husband, a Vietnam veteran, in the mid 90s. We read and re-read it and loaned it to many people who wept, shared and loved the contents, only to have it ""not returned"". How amazing that some 15 years later I have finally found it again! I've searched every book store! My husband will be so pleased to add this to his Vietnam artifacts and library!"
3,Nice scenery! Silly script and stunted acting but worth the watch,"The ""lost pilot"" is worthless garbage, but I found the first and second seasons to be fun to watch, with great scenery, well shot. The writing is sometimes awful and the acting is often poor, but the comparison to this series being a mix of Melrose Place and Dark Shadows is perfect.If you like campy, dramatic fun with little connection to reality and enjoy watching good looking guys with some ocassional nudity, you should like this set."
4,Fascinating!,"I very much enjoyed this book. I was bored the first 1/3 of the way through(hence the loss of a star), but after that it get's interesting. So if you decide to read this one, just hang in there, okay.Max was absolutely fascinating. I loved the way his charachter was developed. And the writer explains the details about the disorder (DID/MPD) in such a way as to be interesting rather than boring and over my head. This book was without a double one of the better thrillers I've read in recent months. I CAN""T WAIT for the sequel."
5,Inspiriational and life changing,God's Promises is a profound reminder of the Truth. This audio presentation is inspirational and life changing and I highly recommend it.
2,Not as practical as you would think,"If you are accustomed to pack walking your dogs this leash will do nothing for you. I bought it on a lark. In a pack walk both (or multiple dogs) walk in groups. On the odd occassion one may have trouble going to the bathroom, the other dog can pull on it without your control. Impractical product...unless your dogs aren't trained to pack walk, then it might be useful.Loops 2 Double Handle Nylon Leash, 6-Foot, Blue"
3,What you get is NOT what you see,"The quality of the drip pans is not in question here - new pans are always nice. In this picture you see one 8"" pan and three 6"" pans but the text says two of each. I ordered it anyway thinking it was a typographical error - the pictures and text do not agree on the Target website either. The drip pans arrived within a few days -very expedient! However, the package insert says one 8"" pan and three 6"" pans but the package actually contains two of each. What am I to do? Return it and intentionally order the wrong product in the hopes of getting the correct product? No. I salvaged one of my old drip pans instead and now have an extra 8"" pan."
5,Perfect Fit!,They fit my apartments 1980's Hotpoint range perfectly! Great for the price and glad that they come with the trim rings as well. Will re-buy when I am getting ready to move out.
5,THE BEST BOOK IN THE WORLD!!! (paints perfect teen picture),"This book is sooooooo amazing and you MUST read it now!!! Especially if you are a teenager, but either way...it was the best book! Sammie is going through so much in her life and throughout the novel, you really feel for her. I now have a new favorite author! Carolyn Mackler could not have done a better job writing this! I also felt so deeply connected to Sammie, I have so much in common with her it's scary! Between all the nyc things (like PB&CO) and even having a Grandmother in Pittsburgh...I really felt like I was reading a book that could've been written about myself. I read a lot, and this is by far the best book ever! And as an aspiring writer and out of love for the book, I am Mackler's #1 fan!READ IT!!! Please, you'll thank me later!~*~*~*~*~perfect book - especially for teenagers~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*"
3,A new beginning,"John Nathan Turner took over the reins of the series as producer and he showed viewers what was in store for the future of Doctor Who; better special effects, a great opening and stronger performances by future Doctors. The problem with this story is one that is featured in many future stories, plot. Nathan-Turner was more concerned with the flash of the series and not the substance. He went for the hype, the gimmick and left many a story that could have been great flailing to the side. The Leisure Hive is a strong example of this. A great idea of a planet used for pleasure being faced with extinction, but there are so many gaps in the story, you're left scratching your head and saying, ""HUH?"" The three stars are for the good points and for the intentions of the author."
3,moderate stylee at the hive,"I can't actually remember seeing this, the first of Tom Baker's last series, in England, which may be related to it not being one of his best. But it does have Romana and an amusing entre-denouement with K9, the plot is tight enough to hold a 6 year old through the 4 episodes, the fascist villain is well played and the lincoln-green bug-""villains"" are wonderfully redolent of an era apart from 2067 or whatever (i.e. it is still the seventies, no wads on the table). The opening tracking shot of Brighton Beach is quite wonderful - who needs Touch of Evil!. This is also the video that introduced the Dr to my son, and yes, he did hide behind the sofa on first viewing."
2,"Nice-looking, I suppose.","This was the start of a new era for Dr Who - new music, new direction. This adventure's 'beginning of a new era' aspect is, to be honest, about all it has going for it. There is so much importance placed on style, nice-looking sets and clever camera shots that the whole thing never actually gets round to telling any kind of a story. The Doctor and his companions arrive in a leisure complex, the Doctor ages 500 years by mistake, the Doctor helps save everybody from a race of decidedly uninteresting lizard-people.True, this adventure has a freshness and energy about it, but that can't help disguise the frankly dull storyline."
3,"They have held up so far, but I haven't slept on my bed much",They should invent one that is filled with sand so they don't move as much. I will probably fill them with sand and then glue something on the bottom so that it's a heavier weight. It did hold up on valentines day though ;D.
2,Not for me,"I ordered these for ""furniture."" Put them under chairs. Might be my fault; perhaps I should have known they would not work with chairs. Anyway, I was going to return them, but Amazon told me to keep them and refunded my money. No complaints from me..."
4,Great for Round Post Legs,These furniture lifters are great for round post beds only. I could use them because my daughter's bed had two round posts and the headboard had rectangle legs. But they appear to be good and solid.
3,Not too bad and not the greatest.,A little hard to use and only comes with one needle. Not real kid friendly.
4,Gets the job done just fine,"Wow, there are a lot of reviewers unhappy with how this pump leaks air/deflates the ball/feels cheap, etc. I guess I must have gotten lucky with the quality of my pump because I have been using this product regularly for several months with none of those problems.One of the great things about this pump is you can put it back into the plastic case it came in (snaps shut) before throwing it into your gym bag. I suspect that if I didn't use the case the pump would have experienced significantly more wear and tear and may be more leaky. Not sure, but for a $5 pump that gets used and abused, can you really expect it NOT to leak?Overall a good product for the price and just the ticket for inflation needs before hitting the hardwood. I will continue to give Spalding my business for basketballs and related accessories."
3,"Spend more, get better....","This works fine but is tough for kids and doesn't seem like it will last very long. I bought a metal foot pump, with a built in air pressure gauge that was made of metal and can be used for bike tires, balls, etc., for less than $15 (to replace this ball pump). A foot pump is just so much easier. Of course, get a good ball, and you shouldn't have to pump it very often. Once you use a foot pump, these hand pumps will go right into the garbage (or to someone else). If money is an issue, this will work. If you want something a lot better, for a little more, go to a good foot pump."
3,"It works, but not the best pump for every need.","This pump works for basic stuff, but that is about it. It gives you what you pay for, which is a ball pump that cost under 5 dollars. Don't try to inflate anything large, or you will stress the pump out."
1,Don't buy this!!!!,I think it has a release to prevent you from over inflating a ball. But the release works too well. You wont get the required pressure unless you pump really fast and yank the needle out really fast. I've got several broken needles now. Frustrating!
1,This pump is a joke!,"This product is of extremely poor manufacturing quality. Instead of easily inflating the ball, it actually deflates the ball further, when the pin is released. Amazon should not be supporting vendors that manufacture such cheap quality products!"
3,"Worth watching, but not a classic by any means","There are two Tom Baker eras - one is very dark, sophisticated and Gothic, the other is mostly rather tacky, childish and spoof-like. Unfortunately 'Nightmare of Eden' falls into the latter category. The idea behind it is sound enough, with interesting concepts such as two spaceships emerging from light-speed at the same point in space, as well as the grown-up theme of drug-smuggling. The problem lies in the story's execution. For a start, the central villain is just too comical to take seriously. Then there are the cartoon-like scenes in which the Doctor leads the Mandrels away, and later emerges from a mauling with his clothes in tatters but not a scratch on him. In fact the whole thing feels too much like a live cartoon. If you want a Dr Who story from the campier Tom Baker seasons you'd be better off with the far superior 'Sun Makers' or 'City of Death'."
5,Wow...Just wow.,"I have to admit I bought this not expecting as much as I got. First of all the player looks sweet. 2nd o fall, the ear plugs that come with it sound better than ear plugs you'd buy individually. Probably the best sounding ear buds I've ever heard.Also, putting songs onto it is easy as hell. Just click and drag.HIGHLY recommended. I love this thing."
4,Interesting and fun.,"I really enjoyed First Counsel mostly because the plot is good and it was neat to read about the inner-workings of the White House. Granted, the book is fiction but Meltzer has a few thank you's to WH insiders so I assume there is a bit of truth about security and what-not. As always the hip dialogue of 20-somethings arguing and joking is a lot of fun. Good stuff."
3,Good.......But,"This the third book I have read from this author and the formula hasn't changed. The main character is smart in his/her profession than just plain stupid in every other part of their lives. All of Meltzer's books have been page turner --- thank goodness. But nothing comes close to his first novel, The Tenth Justice!!!"
2,Reads Like It's Written by a 15-yr. Old,"I wasn't crazy about his last book, either. But the author has some good story ideas, so I figured I'd try him one more time. Mistake. He writes as if he is 15 yrs. old. No sophistication whatsoever in his writing style or --the bigger sin--in his characters. I find it hard to imagine any adult in the situations he writes about or acting/reacting as he portrays them. The story idea was good enough to keep me reading the entire book, but that's all I can say for it."
2,Aren't we all sick of White House Scandals?,"If I had to sum this book up in one word it would be: Unlikely. A young White Lawyer begins to date the daughter of the President. They have some fun events and adventures outwitting the Secret Service at times, and those episodes have their merits, but both the young Lawyer and ""Shadow"", the code name for Nora Hartson, the president's daughter, become ensnared in a political snaggle that involves betrayal, murder, and of course, the inevitable scandal. The reason I use the word ""Unlikely"" is because it is highly improbable for any of this to happen the way the author tries to betray it, and books. as you know, that try hard to incorporate an element of truth but use the wrong characters and situations, are a failure. It becomes a who-dun-it, and a boring one at that."
3,"Long read, interesting insight into White House Staff Protocol & Operations","I did not care for ending as regardless of what Party holds the Presidency or Vice Presidency I think the offices should be treated with respect and national pride. The inside details on how the various White House personnel, Secret Service and Legal Counsel offices operate and inter-relate was interesting but don't think realistic. Too long of a read with many unecessary details in some areas. Having worked for an extremely dignified U.S. Senator who was a stickler for proper etiquette, deportment and dress at all times it bother me to think some of these activities could take place. I also hold the Secret Service in the highest of esteem."
3,A letdow,I watch his series on tv sometimes and i thought he would be more of a Da Vinci code kind of author. Instead It was a bit juvenile. Not what I expected.
3,i wanted to like it....,"I read the Millionaires and I was hoping to enjoy this one but I kind of didn't. I'm not really a fan of political thrillers, although this kept my interested most of the time. It's just not the type of book that I usually like to read. I'm sure others will be very fond of it. I do suggest reading the Millionaires, its a fun financial thriller that is a very enjoyable and easy novel."
2,"Poor Characterization, Boneheaded Thriller","The Tenth Justice wasn't a bad book, so I was excited to get The First Counsel. Here Meltzer gives us a female character who is repugnant and creepy, yet he insists that she is ""complex"" (about 5 times) and extremely appealing. And our main character is supposed to be brilliant, but he's fairly imbecilic sometimes. Metzler doesn't understand that the characters have to act smart or appealing, not merely be described as such. Meltzer does know enough to keep his novel fast paced, but lordy! it's cluttered with dead ends and false leads. He does not create and maintain suspense; instead he throws in as many ingredients as he can find. It's a mess. He attempts to cook everything together in the last dozen pages, but all we end up with is a mess in the kitchen and no edibles."
5,A SUSPENSE LACED READING,"Audiobook aficionados may well remember the sterling readings by Scott Brick of ""The Lion's Game"" and ""The Ice Limit."" He's every bit as effective with his rendering of this mesmerizing tale of D.C. intrigue.Michael Garrick, a promising young White House lawyer, is more than attracted to the President's daughter, Nora. While the path to true love has never run smooth, this path for Michael soon proves to be land mined with insurmountable obstacles.There's a sinister plan afoot at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue masterminded by a White House insider. When Michael and Nora accidentally witness something better not seen, the attorney finds himself locked in a struggle for his very life.Scott Brick's suspense laced reading adds luster to this timely thriller."
1,"Please Dont Read, Please Dont Film.","When I click onto Amazon.com looking for a review of a book I always make the mistake of reading the editorial reviews. After reading this book I now realize that Amazon.com wants to sell books. Not anymore. I have to agree with the customer reviews.. This book stinks. However I cant blame everything on amazon.com. One day while sitting in the john reading the Charleston City Paper I came across a 4 star review for this book. ""A first rate thriller!"" ""A book worth reading, and a screenplay worth filming."" Please dont read, and please dont film.."
5,Devil and the Deep,Very interesting vintage film with Tallulah Bankhead in one of her rare appearances away from the stage and Charles Laughton's first American film chewin up the submarine scenery. Gary Cooper in one of his first talkies is the surprise love interest as the husband believes it is Cary Grant who is his rival. The submarine climax is excellentfor its time (1932) and Tallulah with her deep voice is tops. Altogether a rare and intriguing love quadrangle. Jonathan
3,Enjoyable for Troughton fans,"The existing Troughton episodes pose a dilemma for Troughton fans. Some of the surviving Troughton serials (such as The Krotons) are below par; but we have to make do with what's available. Much of PT's work as Dr. Who was destroyed in the BBC's ""housecleaning"" of its video vaults in the 1970s. Anything that still survives has to be treasured accordingly. Thus, Troughton completists will want to acquire ""The Krotons""; but my sense is that ""The Tomb of the Cybermen"" is still the best memorial for Troughton. ""Tomb"" is a little gem of a serial -- Dr. Who's dialogue with Victoria (in one of the quieter scenes) is especially memorable. ""Tomb"" was also very nearly destroyed."
4,great muffler,good bang for the buck..works great i would sugest it to others .....Thanks for the help. good job
3,Up to date,"I recently purchased this text book to help me with the exceptional students in my class. The book is up to date, but I gave it only 3 stars because of the way it is formated on the page. The paper also has a sheen to it which in certain light makes it difficult to read. Maybe I'm picky, but repositioning the book due to the sheen is wasting my time and delaying how much reading I can do.With that in mind, I would recommend 'Including Students with Special Needs' by Marilyn Friend & William D. Bursuck instead. The layout is easy to read, and the sheen is not intense (easy on the eyes)."
4,Perhaps the only band from Scotland i like,"I spent almost ten years searching for any Gun cd and i couldnt find it anywere, until i step into Virgin Megastore in Oxford Street in London and there it was, not any Gun cd but ""The Collection"" how happy i was and more happy from the moment i started to enjoy track by track, their mega hit ""Word Up"" wich reached the charts in Europe a few yesterdays ago, ""Inside out"" wich was a pleasant surprise for me , ""steal your fire"" the reason i purchased it, Gun was one of that bands hard to describe and hard to put a label for their style, Hard Rock?, Grunge?, Punk? , Alternative?, every audience seemed to like them, metal heads, alternative kids, punkers,etc, etc.They enjoyed certain sucess in United States, England and only a few people with good taste in the rest of the world, this cd features their most essential songs and is a 100% satisfaction guaranteedHM"
4,"""Cute""","ditto to pretty much everything the other reviews have said: it's small, and the color descriptions were a little off. I actually didn't mind that because I stripped it and painted it a really bright shade of pomegranate, and used it as a breakfast nook table.It has self leveling feet which is nice, but putting it together is a little difficult for a small female (it's not heavy, just awkward)."
4,The Bronx is Burning,This was a birthday present for our son who is a huge Yankees fan. He had this movie about a year ago but unfortunately it was stolen. I was so glad I was able to replace it for him. He has watched it a few times since the end of October when we gave it to him.
4,I Love the Yankees,"What can else can I say? I love the Yankees and Billy Martin as a manager -If your a fan, try it, you'll like it"
4,Not bad!,I've been taking these Country Life Power-Dophilus capsules for about 6 weeks now. The good: they are milk-free; I take them once a day (at breakfast). The not so good: I don't think they helped me with regularity though. I am planning to try another brand next time.
5,moving in many ways,"This is by far the best album by the best artist I have ever heard. It's passionate moving and as unstopable as blizzard, while as majestic as the cold north itself. This band and their debut album truly are the winters sun."
2,just read the review,so iam not gonna be dissing the album or the artist jari is very talented i have hope for the future so it has some good tracks like death and the healing and beyond the dark sun winter madness and star child the rest of the album really isnt that great slepping stars i really didnt like and battle against time and beutiful death sadness and hate werent really that great probley the least favorite so it has some good tracks but weak as an album jari does has some seriouse potential i will definetley try wintersuns next album time i guess just try it see if you like it i hope the review helped
5,Works perfect!,This unit works great! very easy to install and very easy to set up and test. The led comes on every time the mic senses sound making it easy to adjust. I wish the other add ons I bought for my Viper were so simple to install and use.
3,"Nice product, lousy service","I like this product. It sounds good, it's reasonably portable, and it looks nice. It is way overpriced, but with Amazon's discount, it falls a bit short of outrageous.The problem I have is that while the box and the ads that are plastered all over the DC Metro system proclaim that the OnStage is ""for all iPods"", the package does not include the necessary adapter for a 60GB iPod. You have to order this -- at no charge -- from JBL, which they say takes a week or more. When I complained to the woman who took my order (a toll call, by the way) that I didn't think this was satisfactory for a $200 retail item, she was rude and sarcastic and refused to put me through to her supervisor.In short, it's a nice product, but if I'm going to pay this much money for this kind of item, I expect to be treated halfway decently. I'll be steering clear of JBL from now on."
1,Volume control broke after a couple of days,"Don't know if it's because I inserted/removed the ipod while the unit was on, but the volume control stopped working correctly after 2 days use. Sounded like an old motorcycle when either of volume control buttons was touched.The JBL FAQ contains the following:Question: My On Stage volume control is not working or is stuck in one position. How can I resolve this?Answer: JBL has discovered that a certain chip used in the production of JBL On Stage will fail under certain circumstances....I did like it while it was working."
1,"Superb sound, but defective none the less","I purchased one of these because the sound quality was so amazing coming from such a little device. I truly didn't believe any of the reviews, i thought they were exaggerated. However after less than a month the unit stopped working. It started off like one of your earlier reviewers mentioned. The speakers woudn't work when I docked my IPOD. It always took several tries and some playing around to get the unit to work. This was after a couple of weeks. After the third week it just completely stopped working! You could turn the power on and charge the IPOD but no sound came out of the speakers. I really didn't get it, the unit was on a dresser next to no electrical inteference whatsoever. Please be advised of this faulty product before considering your purchase. I wish I had."
5,Great for the office,"I've had it for a week now, and it's great. Works perfectly. Sound is better than I expected. I read about some problems that other buyers had and I've been careful not to touch the volume buttons too firmly, remove the iPod after I turn it off, etc. If you take care of it it should last. I would definitely recommend it to people on the fence. It's also small enough to put anywhere. It's also a nice conversation piece."
4,free adapter for the ipod 30 photo,"Just an FYI about the JBL company. I ordered the adapter free on their website and it arrived within a week. Haven't bought the ipod yet, but I have it if I need it."
1,Mine does not work and JBL will not replace it,"My experience the JBL On-Stage has been bad. It worked really well for a few weeks and then stopped completely. I followed the company's instructions to see if mine was one of the defective units that they admit that they shipped. They claim, based on the serial number, that mine does not have a defective chip even though it stopped working.Some people like this product but I do not think it is worth the risk."
1,Junk!,"Same story as others. However, I purchased mine from apple and they refused to take it back. It worked for one day only, then shorted out on the second. Apple told me it's not their product and I should send it back to JBL."
1,Treated with extreme care,"I treated mine with extreme care. Nevertheless after one month it stopped working. While it is a great product when it works, JBL has a much bigger issue here with defective units than they are owning up to.1/24/2006 Update.Had On Stage replaced under warranty. Polite and helpful customer service. Shipping cost $15. Got a brand new unit quickly. Treated with extreme care and careful not to ""hot plug"", i.e. plug in while In Stage or IPod is on. Last night the same symptons as previously occured. No sound out of the speakers."
2,Blew Out 3rd Day,I came into my office today to use my new JBL system with my ipod and it was on the max volume - I tried to unplug- restart- etc- and it just would not work- I then went to JBL site to find out the chip is faulty- and now i have to go through all this hassle of returning it- etc- Good Luck!Amazon should take this product down if this is a real issue!
1,Good sound until it breaks,We are on our second On Stage Speaker and it is about to go back because it is broken again! The volume control is stuck on max. It is still under warranty and the company has replaced in a timely fashion.
3,Secrets,"This book poses Le Carre's view of the world - that is, people get stuck in a web of lies but only a few dare to break out and do something about it. And if they do, they pay for their audacity with their very lives.I think this is book has its strong moments but it also had moments when the reader is forced to put it down out of lack of interest. I think Mr. Le Carre is trying to prove a point here, but he fails at certain paragraphs of the novel."
4,not as good as the movie,If you saw the movie first you maybe dissappointed in the book. The main character Tessa never appears in the first person. However it is a great story.
2,slow read,"this was one of those books that i had to force myself to finish for the sake of finishing. despite its wordiness, i never got a good picture of what was going on, the characters, their connections. maybe its a british thing?"
4,Great for the average Joe,This is not audiophile quality but it sounds very satisfactory to me on my Denon turntable through a denon receiver. I think that this would more than meet the needs of most average people. To me the price makes this a great value and I bought two of them just in case I ever need a spare. I am happy with this purchase.
2,Spiders Attack!,"I'm glad to know that Dave Spencer really enjoys ""Planet of the Spiders"", but it certainly does not deserve the ""five stars"" he gives it. This episode should have been the celebration to end the Pertwee era. Unfortunately, it isn't. It's way over padded, the ""James Bond"" style chase episode is a little long winded, and the production of the whole story seems tired and lazy. There are some redeeming features about ""Spiders"": the Spiders themselves are pretty good, Pertwee gives a great performance(as does Lis Sladen), and the ending really makes up for the whole story. Not the classic it should have been, ""Planet of the Spiders"" is just....OK."
4,Enjoyable if you're not looking for serious sci-fi.,"This is the kind of science fiction which is entertaining and worthwhile purchasing not because of its quality, but because it is so awful it's fun.The story is padded out with chase scenes and the like, but most of it involves rubber spiders on strings 'dancing' along and talking in silly voices, a character (Cho-Je) who is supposedly mystical but comes across as comical, some comedy fighting, and hilariously bad special effects and over-acting. The spider 'high council' are like something straight out of Childrens' TV.True, there are some more serious and memorable moments - the mind-link scenes, the ideas behind the blue cystal, and the final scenes involving the showdown between the Doctor and the Great One, not to mention his inevitable regeneration, are gripping and make for tense, involving viewing. Pity then that you could almost believe the rest of this was played for laughs."
1,This is crap,"This is junk! Ok most of the guys used to be in this band called the Connie Dungs. Rather than step forward into a creative angle that they had slowly been making headway into in the dungs, they fell into this pit of new indi/Jawbreaker/B.S. That is really very depressing. Some wish they would return to the pop angles of ol' I think they should should take a step forward towards something thats not regurgitated and weak. For something of valor look elsewhere!"
3,"Karajan's show, second-rate singing","amazon allows you to hear most of the opera online, so you can judge for yourself if the above reviewer is right to adore Anna Moffo as Violetta. She was a gorgeous woman who tried to save her declining career by taking her clothes off for nudie men's photos. Well and good, but here she is a dark-voiced, rather mature sounding Violetta who doesn't really have the goods vocally. Cioni is a bland, unimaginative alfredo.With so many great singers performing these roles on CD, the only reason to try this super-budget set is for Karajan's conducting. He never performed Traviata in the studio--one wonders why since he recorded so much Verdi, but he excluded this opera and Rigoletto. I don't think there's even a pirate of Rigoletto, but there is another pirate Traviata that one can explore. It's a fairly dismal adventure, given the terrible sound most of these pirates are afflicted with."
5,Turlough! Where is that boy?,"A new three story arc begins with Mawdryn Undead which also turns out to be the strongest of the three. The Black Guardian returns with a new attempt to kill the Doctor. As he cannot interfere directly, he sends in young Turlough, the alien trapped in a British public school in the 20th century. Turlough was one of the best compnaions when he first premiered in the series. Unfortunately, the writers didn't keep it up and he devolved into one of the most boring by the endof his run. In Mawdryn Undead, the Doctor is forced to give up his remaining regenerations in order to save a group of scientists who are trapped in an eternal, painful regeneration cycle. His only saving grace is the appearance of two Brigadier Lethbridge Stuarts from two different time lines. It's great seeing Nicholas Courtney in the role once again. Of the three stories in the series, this is the only one really worth owning."
4,A mixed but enjoyable mess,Fairport Convention (Self-titled debut): This first album from a great group has rockin' folk and folkin' rock and versa visa. This is a very enjoyable album though not all of the songs work well and as such it is a very nice four-star release.
2,"Unfortunately, a poor example of a promising series",This is one of the most unentertaining Doctor Who adventures. The first episode is decent enough however it goes 'downhill' from there. The only pleasant aspect of the show is the 'KandyMan.' END
3,A Satisfactory Novel at Best!,"I believe Don Delillo is on par with other writers like Philip Roth, Cormac McCarthy, and Joyce Carol Oates. This short novel is an easy read but it leaves you with more questions than answers about the plot which thinly. It's about a body artist whose husband, a film-maker, commits suicide. She was his third wife. She retreats to an undisclosed location but far away from New York City where they lived. She meets another man who appears to know more about her. I think that I will have to read it again to get the full story but I admire the author's writing style and his ability to make a breakfast scene into pure poetry. There is not much story but character driven strong characters."
2,Grandiose self-absorption,"This is my first experience with author Don DeLillo, so I will review this book without comparison to previous works. I found the protagonist, Lauren Hartke, to be an introverted, egotistical, masochistic bore. The author depicted this complex, unhealthy character with precise attention to detail, extreme care, and emotionless observation.However, I found myself fascinated with the ""little man"", Mr. Tuttle. I wondered if he was an hallucination brought upon by the stress of grief in an unstable psyche. I never thought he was really flesh and blood, even while watching the erotic encounter in the bathtub. [Actually, the entire book has a voyeuristic quality.] Perhaps Tuttle was an alien being: ""From a long way off what would he look like, walking the way he walked, narrowly, in curved space?"" As short as it is, this is a ponderous work which offers the reader little insight or gratification, but a lot of curious unanswered questions."
4,Good printer for Linux,"My home network has a mix of Windows and Linux PCs. Like some of the other reviewers, I agree that the Windows setup instructions are a bit murky, but I had no problems. Also, the HP Solution Center application is fairly unhelpful, if you need help. One demerit for weak documentation and software.Quality of printing is excellent from Windows, although photos require the purchase of a third printer cartridge. To use it, you have to remove the black cartridge. This cartridge comes with a clip to cover the bottom of the ink well when it's out of the machine.For Linux, you need to get the driver [...]. Quality and control of output are excellent on Linux, as well.Lastly, the built-in web server on the printer is helpful for checking on the printer's status via a network. Many devices have these embedded these days, and it's nice to be able to access the printer via a browser."
3,Just nice looking...,"I just got this printer for work. It was fairly easy to set up. This unit looks heavy duty. However, the print speed and quality isn't as good as my old obsolete HP895Cse."
2,PAPER WASTER!!!,"I have spent all morning babysitting this printer because it will suck up 5 pages at a time and print on all of them. It has completely wasted over 50 sheets of paper, because I'm trying to print on both sides, which is a complete disaster when it sucks up 5 pages at a time and prints a section of a document on every single page. It's a terribly annoying design flaw and is a huge waste of time. The only think I like is the wireless feature which is very easy for my laptop. If only it worked better!! I'm stuck with it now, but will probably be re-selling mine on here soon!!!!!!"
2,Wifi dead,"I got a Lexmark and HP DeskJet 6890. Both sucks. Neither Wifi worked. It's a myth. YOu have to plug it in; either, ethernet or USB to get them to work. Wifi is a come on. The manuals are outdated for a Mac and the warranty expired. Customer service is a dream andconstant put on hold. I honestly don't know of a printer out there, that is worth buying! And you can expect to work, like advertised!!!"
1,No Windows 7 Software,Just bought this printer but it only works on Windows Vista and I have Windows 7 Ultimate.I will noy buy anymore HP products!
3,WIFI problematic,"The printer is very good for the price, but the WIFI is an incredible pain to get working. My home office network consists of two laptops. I was able to get the WIFI working once, but it has since refused to cooperate. HP printer seems to also suffer a software problem, since I constantly get error reports that pop up even when I'm using the laptop outside my home. Instruction manuals are useless. Perhaps calling into HP helpdesk would work, but I haven't found the time yet."
1,More Amway/Quackstar Hype!,"Obviously this book was printed for the thousands of Quackstar/Amway cult followers who will buy this book and line their uplines pockets because it was recommended by upline. Another rah-rah about Amway without the serious look at the downsides. 40 million hits? That's 2 million Amway/Quackstar-ites trying to log on 20 times per day unsuccessfully. That large thud you heard was not a meteroite, it was the launch of Quickstar! The average consumer will not put up with the tedious and slow nature of the site. Another ruse by Company and top distributors to get money out of distributors pockets. What a farce!"
5,A must read for those who want to access their success!,"From behind the scene dreams to concrete reality, Mr. Barefoot informs the Internet generation of one of the brightest stars in their future, much in the same way Pilzer's book ""Unlimited Wealth"" predicted the Dow breaking 10,000 ten years ago! Quixtar is the economics of people helping people."
2,High Hopes,"I think I thought tha it would clean the service below the eyes completely and it did not. It helped some, but the puppy did not like me messing with her face that long. Will continue using it."
1,Doesn't do the job,"It only takes a small amount of brown tear stain off, I had to scrub my dogs face with a vengeance to get it to remove anything, not worth the time or money or your dog's well being!"
4,Helpful Pamphlet For Reconciling Feminism & Christianity,"This short pamphlet offers a well-thought out reconciliation of the concepts of feminism within the Christian framework of the Bible. As described in Keyes booklet, the Bible contains messages of equality both in the OT and NT that were radical for their time and, if truly applied as intended, still radical for today. A very handy introduction to this topic and a must-read for anyone struggling to reconcile a feminist perspective with a Christian journey of faith. You get 5 copies of this pamphlet for the purchase price, so you can hand them out to your friends."
3,Informative but outdated...,"The military changes its rules and policies so rapidly that a lot of the information in this book is actually incorrect. It is also highly biased toward the website www.cinchouse.com and really should be called ""Married to the Navy: A Survival Guide for Navy Newlyweds."" If you're only currently dating a military man or you're in a different branch is isn't nearly as informative.It contained a lot of general ground rules on how do keep a long distance (high-stress!) relationship working and it was useful in that way, but I'm of the opinion that there are probably better, more informative books in print than this one.Useful if you know nothing about military life, but in general most of this information can be found on the internet."
1,Biased and Crude,I agree there are things in this book that help military wives but it is geared towards navy only!
2,Liked it better before I saw this site,"Well, the visual guide to ranks was helpful. I'm a girlfriend whose man is in the Marines and I found the ranks confusing despite some internet research... now I can tell who's who in the company. I read it and enjoyed it but now I have to wonder how much of this information is accurate?"
1,Just alright,"This book is fairly accurate and Informative , but the average person should have the common sense of most situations described in the book , I would only suggest this if you have absolutely no idea what the military is like or have been hiding under a rock"
1,Women IN Uniform? Please...,"Just from the cover as a woman that is a veteran we don't fit into the realm of military wives even if we married a fellow service member. As for those that ARE wives and girlfriends, I recommend social networking. Speak with those that are living the life right now. If you want to know about military life, UCMJ, acronyms and so on, there are plenty of reliable websites (military one source, military.com etc.) that will help you. This woman should be ashamed to put this book out and the publishers are not worth a damn for publishing something that no one evidently looked into verifying."
4,--Not bad--,"This fragrance smells really good.. Got a lot of compliments.. Although, its very sweet; has a strong lemon in it.. Smells like a lemon pastry.. The longevity is at least 8 hours.. Great fall all seasons.. If you like sweet/citrus fragrances, I would recommend this one.."
3,No Assembly Language Required,It wasn't mentioned in the reviews I read but I was hoping for some good Assembly language examples. Unfortunately They did not use Assembly but instead a $250 Pic-Basic program. There is a cheaper version for $100 and the Author did provide examples for both. You will also need a programmer to actually program the PIC. So if you main goal is building a Robot with Pic micro controllers without learning the Assembly language then this book is for you.
3,"Pretty Good Value, OK Quality","My Dad took picutres at my wedding with one of these cameras, and got back the digital photos with his prints. Both were of equal quality as far as that goes. The camera focuses well.However, we found that even with its built in flash, the pictures that he took inside, during the wedding, were dim and relatively worthless. The exterior pictures were lit fine, but the ""mood lighting"" was dim, and the flash wasn't able to compensate for that.*****Final Thoughts*****The camera is a great one to grab on your way to the zoo or the ball game, but if you're going to your high-school graduation or with some friends to a dinner, you probably want to pass.This is a brightly-lit-area camera."
5,Hilariously funny!,"I was out of town and just happened to catch this movie about 30 minutes into the beginning. Being a huge fan of Michael Caine, Carol Burnett, John Ritter and Christopher Reeve, I loved this movie.I'm sure anyone would enjoy it, especially anyone who has ANY theatre experience.Great movie, all star cast, truly horrible how many of them are gone now."
5,Awesome Movie!,"Oh just wanted to say that this movie, for being a VHS tape, was in good quality and of course, awesome actors, GREAT movie....Hilarious!"
2,World Tech HX252 RC Helicopter,"This helicopter was hard to control once in the air. It went up very well. It is also very fragile. On the first landing, we broke the landing gear off the helicopter. I am having trouble finding replacement parts for it."
3,Nice..but,"These are really nice towels. The decorative bottoms are good quality and very pretty.Why I took away two stars is because the towel itself is really thin. I was surprised that a $20 towel had such little material. I wasn't wanting a really thick body towel of course, but the bottom is much heavier because of the thinner material above it, so it will fall off the towel rack easily. I had to pin them together in order for them to stay on the bar in case someone pulls on it.It's soft and pretty, don't get me wrong, and I'm happy with them overall because of the quality of the decorative part. But, I don't think I'd buy this brand again unless it was the only choice for my colors."
5,classic Mau5,Excellent production on and excellent show in his hometown. Sofie stuns and it's 2 hours of power. You'll like it.
4,dylan poster,"well, the post bent the bloody box! there was a slight dent in the poster and with alittle ironing dylan cleaned up like a brand new penny! love it! thanks amazon. prairie"
3,"""A Case Of Energy Squared""","A merely satisfactory episode. This is one of the first that delves into the interiors of the TARDIS, and is of note for that reason. As has been noted, the styling is elaborate and handsome. The costumes are plausible if not completely convincing, and the denoument is all right, though little is explained and there's no clue how the Doctor could repeat the effort if he tried. However, the supporting characters move herky-jerky through the situations, most of which are contrived, and no satisfying explanation is given of how the cult of Demnos has survived twelve centuries past its recorded end without ending up in the history books -- a point which seems vital to the progression of the story. As I say, merely satisfactory."
4,Quick change,This is a very simple on off valve with nice brass quick on off valves rather than the cheap hard plastic ones others have. I can swap out the hose ends without running out to the front to turn the hose off. I live in an old home with one spout out front.
1,Junk - Did not make it through the summer.,This is another crap garden hose product. It broke with in weeks of use. First the screw came loose on the valve then the plastic nut cracked and made the hole thing useless. I also purchased and would recommend the (Dramm 12353 Heavy-Duty Brass Shut-Off Valve) (*The Dramm valve that I recommend is MADE IN THE USA!) you can find it here on Amazon. Yes it is expensive but it's made of machined brass and it very well built. It did make it though the summer and most likely will last a lifetime.
1,Utter *insert expletive here*,"I bought this book when I was ... just starting out in the Craft. I'd read Teen Witch and absolutely loved it (though I know think it's pathetic), so naturally I bought this book soon after. Even then I was disappointed.First of all, I dislike the way RavenWolf puts down the word Wicca. Very early on in the book, she says she uses the word Witchcraft because Wicca reminds her of that old movie The Wicker Man and furniture. ...Second, this book is so full of fluffy bunny [stuff] I want to vomit. It's really hard to put my finger on what it is about this book I dislike so much, it just doesn't strike me as accurate information about Wicca, it just seems like some New Age form of Witchcraft churned out to make some money. Either that or Silver is stupid, very stupid.Give it a miss. ..."
3,Slow way to get started,"This was my first book getting started in the Craft. A lot of information was helpful, but a lot wasn't. This book is great if you want background material and rules, but if you want to get down to business and try some spells, this is not for you. I like the way that the book is straightforward, it gives a comfortable feeling, yet some say it's great for beginners...I found it wasn't simply because Ravenwolf speaks as if you already know you want to be serious and acts as though you have already planned to devote your whole life to the religion. For many beginners this is not the case. Yet, all in all the book was pretty good. Blessed Be."
5,GRRRRRRRRRRRRRREAT BOOK!!!!,"I loved this book. It was one of the first books I read on the Craft and it was very informative. It has everything a Witch could possibly want to know, and a little more!"
1,I was just like you,THis book is VERY poorly written. I am a beginner Pagan and i found out that she mislead the information given it upset me very much. There are some good things in it but she screwed up her words too much and is not a good book for beginners who don't know much about pagan. If you are wiccan then it is okay i guess.
1,Save yourself the trouble.,"Silver Ravenwolf (and many other with her publisher) are complete dribble. Biggoted ideas and her own rules according to the craft. If I had to retitle this book it would be ""Witch Sterotypes: Silver Ravenwolf's version of Wicca."" For real magical information believe me when I tell you to go elsewhere!"
3,Scares Your Parents and Enlighning! LoL,"Ive found this book very helpfull. The only thing I dont agree with is that there is no such thing as a Satanic Witch. But all is forgiven since this is a very commen wiccan misconception. I think Silver does try to aim at the teens a bit... or perhaps she just still feels like a teen herself! It is a little on the fluffy bunny side but I certainly give her tons of respect and credit for the chapter ""theres no such thing as a white witch"". God and goddess know its true! Above all else there is DEFFINITLY better work out there on wicca and paganism (that is why I gave it only 3 stars) but seems how its one of the most popular wiccan series its good to read up on it."
1,"Fluff, total fluff....",I got the impression that this is a money maker. It dilutes some of the most essential aspect of Wicca into nothing.I've been involved in Wicca for more than 10 years and there are too many books just like this out. I only gave it 1 star because I couldn't select 0 stars.
4,Good,This book is a good start for anyone who is interested in learning the craft as it helped me find a place to start.
5,Great book for the beginner,"This was the first book I ever read on the craft. Loaded with basic information and a beautiful rendition of The Charge of the Goddess. Basic information on everything you need to know to become a witch as well as journal writing excersises, meditations, and simple formulas. Every time you read it from the 1st time to the 100th time, you discover something new."
4,"This is an informative, funny beginners book!","This is only one of the books I started out with. Silver made me feel welcome and informed. She filled this book with rich chapters full of beliefs, magick, and how-to's. I would recomend this book to any person's looking to practice or beleive! I found it entertaining and informative for the New Age searcher. GREAT FOR BEGINNER'S!!!"
3,Take that broomstick and shoove it (just kidding),"Silver is the center of many debates in the Wiccan community. Many feel her writing is fluff and for people who don't want to learn ""real witchcraft"". Others feel she is a great steeping stone to start with and progress with because of her different publications.My thoughts are this: her book is filled with good information. She goes through and touches on many different topics like most Wicca 101 books do. by reading you feel you know the author because of how she puts her own personality in so often.Her writing is good, easy to read, and has information that is useful. There are better ""Wicca 101"" books out there, but I don't think any are as easy to read. I recommend only for beginners and younger readers"
2,Nice Content,"While this book has a nice content, I am still hesitant to recommend it to those who are a bit more advanced in their studies/practice of witchcraft. Ravenwolf is good at tying everything to match her views, and forgets to explain that witchcraft has many many paths. She discusses her personal life MUCH too much, but the content of the book is a feast for a pagans soul."
1,Not thorough enough,"In this book, the first I've read by Mrs. RavenWolf, she cover lots of topics. Too bad they are not in depth. She skims by such topics as astral projection and reincarnation and as soon as you are interested, it's off to another subject. Also this is not a good book for anyone new the Craft. It gives a false introduction to Wicca by saying you can create an entire seperate human being to do things for you and that you can ""bend"" time. Maybe witches in Hollywood can do that but none that I know. A much much better book is Scott Cunningham's ""Wicca: A Guide for the Solitary Practitioner"""
4,Great for pagans of all ages!,"This book is great for beginers, but also proves worthy higher level practicioners of all orders. This is the first SRW book I read and I would highly recommend it for anyone interested in Witchcraft. SRW's sequel, ""To Stir a Magick Cauldron"", is a little bit hard to follow if you have not read ""To Ride a Silver Broomstick"" first"
5,good book,"Ive read well over a dozen books on the kennedy assasination,& this one ranks up near the top. I always had feelings about who was involved- cia, cuban exiles, mafia, etc. But the one puzzling thing was the question of who could have carried out the coverup for 40 yrs, controlling the press, the warren commission's investigation, etc. & this book spells it out clearly. Roberts identifies the power elite of the world, often reffered to as the high cabal, invisible government, the commitee- as those who actually planned the coup, those who gave the orders. Read this book along with Zr Rifle by Claudia Furiati & u will learn the truth about who killed kennedy & why he had to die!"
5,Life Changing,"Excellent book all the way through. I have been practicing martial arts ranging from shaoling kung fu to taichi. I have always been interested in chi for instance. It is the force that we have inside of us and we can cultivate and and use it for either inner strength, outer strength or used for healing. For the first time in my life I experienced the chi inside of me through the constant practice of kundalini yoga described in this book. As with anything else in the world you will only get out of it what you put into it. Back pain has gone away never to return and I am a changed man as far as my ego and can feel the difference in my life."
3,Close but no cigar,"I've used this powder for over 20years and have usually been able to find it in my local WalMart. There have been times in the past where it wasn't carried so I had to look a little harder, but what I found was always the same.This time however, no WalMart in 4 counties had what I needed so I went to my second source.....AMAZON. I found it with no problem, ordered the exact color I needed and waited with much assurance from past purchases to receive exactly what I wanted. 4days after ordering my package arrived and as soon as I opened the cover I could immediately tell it wasn't the same. The color was darker, the powder wasn't nearly as refined as what I'd been using and the smell was different. Now, that's not to say it's not Coty that has made the change; but I won't be ordering this product online again."
1,Not as expected,The color was not as expected. It was very 'rosey' and was unusable. It is difficult to know what color to order unless you've used the product before and know what color number to order.
4,Not bad,"It's not perfect, but it's darn good. I bought 2 for my living room, which is 12x18, and it rocks pretty hard. I built a ""false"" wall to house these, a left and right in-wall speaker and a center channel, as well as to hide the wires to my TV which is wall mounted. My only regret is not doing enough to make the framing sturdier because these puppies shake the wall. They're great. I'm sure it's the nature of the enclosure (I'm not a sound engineer or anything), but the response isn't even... and they're not as crisp as I'd like, but they are great and I'm glad I bought them. I use the Polk SWA500 to power them and it does great. In fact, I have to turn it to about 2/3 when I watch movies because it's just too much."
5,It takes a village...,"Amidst the sterile routines of suburban England, Ballard tells a short fable about the loving your children too much. The post-mortem objective style of the massacre's investigator adds to the unsettling tone of this novel. Like Ballard's other works (I've read Crash, War Fever, and the Atrocity Exhibition) he explores the subterranean barbarities latent in our denatured, desensitized urban landscape. This novel is hardly one to advocate nurturing our future generations, since the blank-eyed authoritarianism of suburban child nurturing is blamed for the pscychopathic massacre. Loving a child, doesn't mean that the child is free. And the children, suffocated by parental love, suburbia, and technocracy has two routes: suicide (like 'The Virgin Suicides') or murder. Ballard shows that children are far from innocent: little bundles of joy who are ticking time bombs with artificial smiles and revenge fantasies. A must read for parents and high schoolers everywhere."
1,Shadows very distracting and resolution unsatisactory,"I bought both the original and the paperback version as gifts for my wife. She was very dissatisfied with both as the light they provide is marred by vertical shadows across the page which she found distracting. Evidently not everyone is bothered by these shadows, based on the positive reviews and the fact that in calling the manufacturer with the problem, I was told that that is how they worked and my only recourse was returning them to the place I bought them.Since the packages had been opened, Amazon charged a steep re-stocking fee plus shipping and handling charges. I ended up paying about 40% of the price of the items for the total unstatisfactory experience.I strongly recommend that you buy this item where you can try it first."
3,Works Great!,You are able to read a book or view a chart in the dark without disturbing the light level of those around you. A convenient portable light source.
4,Great to use but scratches easily!,This is my second one. Special care needs to be taken to not scratch it. I have the old one in the car and one by my bed.
2,Scratches too easily,Light is ok but the plastic used to provide light and see through scratches way too easily.. Should have been made out of glass.
1,Good idea. Lousy execution.,"Problem 1: Scratched in ten minutes flat, while sitting inside a book. It was scratched by paper.Problem 2: LEDs are not diffuse enough. You get a neat interferometry pattern on your page. (You did that experiment in high school, didn't you?)Problem 3: Awkward to flip pages.I liked the idea. I just wish it was designed by somebody who actually used it."
3,"A ""Present-Day"" Story","""The War Machines"" was the first serial to have took place in the present day (at least, the present day as we know it when it was aired!) It was exciting to see the return of familiar surroundings.I enjoyed this serial so much because it was not based completely on action and killing. It demonstrated how computers may run our lives some day. In the 21st Century, they do. Hopefully, however, they won't become as dangerous as the war machines in this story.The only complaint I have of this story is the poor farewell to Dodo. I rather liked her and felt she deserved a better swan song."
3,limited options...,"when i purchased this product as a solution to my kitty's litter box issue.... i did not know that it was to be used only with their litter. as their litter is expensive, i cannot use it on a regular basis. sorry but that needs to be made clear in the ad."
2,good but not as effective as the cat attract litter,I got this to use after I had used the Cat Attract litter. I think it helped but it definitely didn't have the results that the Cat Attract litter had.
2,Didn't Notice A Difference,"I didn't use the litter that is made by the same company as the product says to. I use Arm & Hammer Active Naturals (as someone else commented that was what they used with it and it worked great for them). I noticed no difference in my cat who kept using the carpet instead of the litter box.I don't know what issue this is supposed to cure, but anger, hatred, and jealousy are not it! Seclusion in the basement from the other cats (whom he's grown up with since he was a baby) with his own litter box seems to be the only answer."
2,It didn't seem to make a difference,"I used the Litter Attractant as per the instructions on the bottle (no booklet came with it, per the note on the bottle), then read that I must use the Precious Cat litter. That's way too expensive for me (I have 6 cats). I will use up the Litter Attractant anyway and hope for the best."
4,kitty problem,"My little kitty started going to the bathroom on beds instead of in his box. . But we have not had any problems since purchasing this mix to add in with the litter. Although, I am waiting to test it next time he goes to the vet."
3,Cat Attract - Sort-of,"I have adopted a loveable stray cat, who was used to doing his business entirely outdoors. I wanted to train him to use an indoor pan, so I bought Precious Cat Ultra Litter Attractant. This product did attract my cat to the litter pan - but it was more of a curiosity to him. He'd sniff it and then just sit near the pan and purr.I actually had to ""harvest"" some of my outdoor cat's own waste material from his favorite dirt spot outside and add that to his litter pan. That worked. He's now fully trained.This product may be good for cats already used to using a litter pan (or for kittens), but for cold start training on an outdoor cat, it was only moderately effective."
3,Didn't work for me...,"I was really trying to cover all bases on getting my cat to go back to using the litterbox instead of the floor in front of it. This did not do the trick, either by itself or mixed with the recommended litter. The other cat did not care one way or another about it, but I suspect that like catnip, some cats like it and some don't.I ended up with success only after acquiring 3 kittens, a new litterbox, and a pheremone collar from PetSmart all at once. I will never know which factor convinced him to go back, but I strong suspect the pheremone collar, which I WOULD recommend."
5,Charming book,"As always, Catherine Spencer has written a book that transcends the ordinary in romance. Dan Cordell is a gem of a hero, someone we would all like to take home with us. His patience with troubled Molly and his willingness to wait for her to see her own worthiness give him a charm and likability that is exceptionally well portrayed. The writing and character development are outstanding, and the ending tender and hopeful for the future. A true romance."
1,"DO NOT BUY THIS, not cordless, you must plug in","I was looking for cordless and this requires your extension cord to work. I later bought Black & Decker 18 volt cordless with two batteries for about $70 at Lowes...that is much better purchase...this trimmer worked great, just had to be plugged in."
4,"""There is no return. This is Terminus.""","Highly entertaining, though there are a few dull sections. The ship's atmosphere is wonderfully dark and occasionally claustrophobic, then you get to its destination, and that place is even worse... The plot has some interesting twists, and it's fun to watch Tegan and Turlough snipe at one another, then have to work together to try to save themselves. Plus, this is a very important storyline for Nyssa. Yes, the monster walks so slowly, but it wouldn't be a Doctor Who episode if it didn't. <g> And you have to love those 80s outfits and makeup."
2,Better in theory,"After reading the reviews here on Amazon and on a competitor's site, it sounded like these would be perfect walking shoes for my upcoming trip abroad. When they arrived, I was pleased with the softness of the upper, and the slight stretchiness conformed to the foot nicely. However, the size of the sole was off; I usually wear an 11, and ordered an 11W to allow for thick socks, but the sole was at least 1/2"" too long, and 1/4"" too narrow, which dug into the sides of my feet. Perhaps because of the slight heel, the shoe didn't want to stay on, letting my heel slip up with every step and causing irritation after only a few minutes even with socks. The shaft hugged the ankle nicely, due to the slight stretch, but the upper edge flared out strangely, even more strangely considering my larger-than-average calves.If you have a longer, narrower foot, these may work for you, but mine were sent back right away in pursuit of a better walking boot."
3,Great!!! but........,"I have had my TOV 211 oven for about 3 yrs. I loved it very much! the best I have ever had! But......all of a sudden it stopped. my husband took it apart to fix it, and it had two fans that we think went out, because it would be on then while pre-heating, then turn off all of a sudden as if it got too hot---but he couldn't get the fans out to see if he could get a replacement. he couldn't unless he took it alllll apart and by then it would be hard to put back together. The company didn't help me at all. Customer service wasn't any help when I called, and the company didn't even return my e-mail. I want anyother one, but my husband doesn't think it is worth it. Our last one lasted sooo long. I think it was black and decker. I don't think they make them like they used to. I guess we are a ""throw-away"" society--not our fault, its the manufactuers. Maybe my husband will give it one more try. It has the best features of any of them on the market!!!"
2,Toaster Oven,"It broke shortly after we bought it. The manufacturer was very helpful in replacing it. However several months later (after the warantee was up) some feature don't work. It has great room but because it is large, it take some time for toast to get cooked."
5,AWSOME,I LOVE IT! LARGE ENOUGH FOR A ROAST AND PERFECT FOR JUST TOAST. I DID MY FIRST ROAST BEEF ON AIR BAKE AND IT WAS DONE QUICK AND VERY JUICY. FOR THE ONE THAT COMPLAIN ABOUT THE TIMER STARTING AT 60 MINUTES. YOU HAVE TO SET A TIME ANY WAY SO WHAT DOES IT MATTER WHERE YOU START. WITH JUST 2 OF US IN THE HOUSE IT IS THE PERFECT OVEN. I AM A COOKING FOOL WITH MY NEW CONVECTION OVEN.
5,Great simple product,This is a great simple little air chuck. No leaks and great tool. I put a Milton V style end and fills tires fast. I think I ended up paying more for shipping than the tool in the end to get to Alaska.
2,Great cult film - very poor video quality,"I was very disappointed in the current release of Love Letters (Passion Play) on video cassette. It appears to me that the master from which the tape was made was of low quality, the tape is recorded in EP mode, which further degraded the video quality, and the audio quality varies from woeful to just barely acceptable."
2,"Loved it, until they left me hanging","I watched this show from beginning to end--and yes I do mean end--with great attention. I enjoyed it a lot. Until they totally leave you hanging because BBC decided not to finish the show. Extremely disappointing. The least they should have done given that they knew they weren't going to finish the series is do a 2 hour finale or something. So, don't waste your money unless you want to be disappointed."
5,Complexity without Detachment,"Have you ever felt frustrated as a tourist that you had trouble seeing beneath the surface of the sights around you? When visiting South Africa in 2011 for the first time, I ran into this problem. I had read a fair number of South African books before the trip, but the sights around me when I got there raised more and more questions. When I found Anthony Sampson's biography of Mandela, it was like water for intense thirst. Six hundred pages later, I wanted only more. Sampson's work brings together psychology, history, and politics in a rich and authoritative web. He offers understanding that doesn't pretend to be complete, insight without presumption, complexity without detachment."
2,More than you ever wanted to know ..,"The author obviously knows a great deal about Mandela and South Africa. However, there is so much detail that I found the book just deadening over time. The writing style was not engaging enough to sustain me through all the blow-by-blow accounts that one has to plod through . -I was surprised and disappointed that the book was not more enjoyable."
1,Longtime Raffi Fan Extremely Disappointed,"Unlike many of his albums, this one falls far, far short.Since my daughter was born, I've become a huge Raffi fan. We own about a half dozen of his CD's, and they're the ones we seem to return to again and again: Baby Beluga, Singable Songs for the Very Young, Bananaphone, One Light One Sun, they are all great. It makes it all the more disappointing that this album is so dull. His other albums feature approachable, enjoyable, singable songs that my kid wants to sing every night before bed. Somehow Raffi managed an entire album with not one single tune that even approaches Baby Beluga, or Down by the Bay, or Bananaphone, or any of a dozen other songs we now depend on to fill hours in the car or wherever. If they'd give me back my money for already-opened CD's I'd ask for it.Conclusion: If you're missing one of the albums I mentioned above, buy it first. If you're not, save your money or buy one of Laurie Berkner's or Ralph Covert's albums instead."
5,Best Desktop book for Spelling,I'm about ready to order my 2nd book. My first book (1971) is falling apart. I use it so often. It's a great size to keep on my desk. Most of the time I think I know how to spell a word but I just want to make sure. I write lots of reports and letters to parents so I want my spelling to be perfect. Everyone needs this book even if they are a good speller. It's just nice to know I have the security that I need to look a up a word and double check my spelling. I have always found the word I am trying to spell. I love this book....
2,BookUSconst,"I was looking for a book with more detailed stuff. But with this price, this book is not bad."
5,seal tight cast protector,"THIS WAS ORDERED FOR OUR SON WHO BROKE HIS HUMERUS 6 DAYS PRIOR TO VACATION. THE CONCEPT IS GREAT, THE MATERIALS TOP QUALITY,THE DIAPHRAM HAD A GOOD SEAL (NOT CONSTRICTING) THERE WAS NO SEAPAGE INTO THE CAST AREA. THE ONLY DOWNSIDE IS THE PERIPHERAL RING. WIDE AND UNCOMFORTABLE.HOWEVER, IT PROVIDED HIM WITH THE ABILITY TO PARTAKE IN WATER ACTIVITIES, THAT WE ARE SO GRATEFUL FOR. YOUR EXPEDITED DELIVERY IS THE BEST, THANK YOU."
2,Returned item,"I bought this for my step-daughter. In the picture it shows that it just goes over the elbow, when in fact it went way up her arm!"
2,half empty?,I ordered this Ralph by Ralph Lauren body gel because I wear this as perfume and really like it. It was the right product but it came with no sort of seal or anything and the bottle was almost half empty! (Maybe more like 3/4 full but still). I'd return it but I don't think its worth the trouble at this point.
3,no instructions,"lamp is ok, good quality. Only thing is it didn't comes with instructions, and how are we suppose to disassemble this lamp when we want to change bulbs?"
5,WONDERFUL PRODUCT- A MUST HAVE,"My 1 year old loves it, especially the funny antics of bard the dragon. My husband and I love it too- beautiful music and lovely scenery. This and Baby van Gogh are perfect for older babies! Puts all other baby videos to shame."
3,"Five star content, one star presentation","Get A Life was a great series, but the poor picture quality on this set is not really acceptable by today's standards. It is extremely pixellated and/or grainy; it's very difficult to watch and enjoy if you have a large high definition television. The closest way I could describe the picture: it reminds me of watching a bootleg VHS tape that's been copied over and over again. It's unfortunate; other reviews have noted that this may be the best they can do from the sources that are available, but as much as I'd like to sit and watch it, I can't get past the low video quality. My rating would be 5 stars for content, 1 star for the poor video quality. I ended up returning it."
3,"Great show, terrible transfer.","This is the set that you've been waiting for- the entire Get a Life series. The shows themselves are absolutely incredible. This is comedy that is so absurd and edgy that I can't believe it was even made in the first place. Regardless, it WAS and now we can watch all of the episodes.HOWEVER, the DVD transfer is absolutely TERRIBLE. It basically appears as though a decent-quality VHS copy was transferred to disk. It's great to have access to all the episodes, but why is the quality not better?"
1,"Great series, but AWFUL picture quality!","This is an amazing TV series, the best from the 90's. But the video quality is awful! It is like looking of 5th generation copy of a VHS tape. Why oh why? Avoid at all cost!"
1,Seriously lame,This series is unfunny in every sense of the word. I liked Chris Elliot in Something About Mary sothought this series would be good. After two episodes my husband and I decided to forget it. Don'twaste your money.
3,"The ""lost"" Tom Baker story.","Admittedly I might have enjoyed the lone ""lost"" Tom Baker story more if a BBC strike had not prevented its completion, but I'm not too enamored of what remains, and of course as the story progresses there's less and less of it, until the only scenes you actually see in part 6 are inside Chronotis's TARDIS. Tom Baker narrates the remainder with skill and panache, but if you really want Douglas Adams/Doctor Who magic, proceed to ""The Pirate Planet"" and/or ""City of Death"" (which despite the pseudonym is co-written by Adams). This is for completists, and maybe the curious."
2,"Jerry, Where's Your Humility?","I have to admit I was disappointed in this book. I was a fan of Jerry Bailey and always had great respect for him as a rider. He seemed to be a good guy, too, when I would see him interviewed after a race. I still think he is, but he has a problem: a big ego.This book is an ego trip for him, sad to say. Too much of it is Jerry telling how great he is as a professional jockey or just plain human being. Jerry, you don't need to tell us: your record speaks for itself. Another large chuck of the memoir is about his comeback from alcoholism. Well, I would never knock that achievement but it goes on a little long and not to sound cold, but I would have preferred more stories, the inside stuff, on the great sport of horse racing.I still enjoy his excellent analysis on ABC/ESPN and can't help but like the guy. I guess I just expected more out of his book, especially in the modesty department."
4,"Good device, but some things overlooked?","I received the Breadman Panini Maker as a gift, and it certainly delivers.Within minutes I was eating delicious home constructed panini's to me and my wife's delight.Nice things:1) It gets hot relatively quick, and maintains heat.2) Large grilling area.3) Floating hinged top allows equal pressure on all points of a sandwhich being grilled.4) Nothing sticks to this Teflon baby!5) Cord storage underneath unit.6) Small recipe book included with hints on yoru own food pairings and combinations.Area's of concern:1) No on/off switch. Basically plugs in to turn on, remove plu from wall to turn off.2) Rubber feet on base legs have a tendancy to come out from time to time. Not sure why they weren't secured.3) Once off, grill plates stays hot for quite a while. Children watch out!4) Because grill plates aren't removable, and it's overall healthy weight, cleaning in a sink can be awkward. Took me more than a sponge wipe down to clean between grooves."
4,Great Panini Press,"After a fair amount of research, I decided to buy this panini maker for our family, as we have all recently gotten hooked on paninis. While I do wish that the grill plates themselves were detachable for easier cleaning, we are very happy with this product so far. Using regular loaf bread, you can make two sandwiches at a time. I also used this on a pita sandwich, and it worked great there too. It seems like a very sturdy product, and we anticipate a lot of use in the future."
1,very breakable,I ordered it and was very excited to get it but it arrived with the handle broken. Not so bad because return shipping is free. They sent me another to replace it and it too was broken-worse than the first. They only ship it in it's shelf box. I say send another and now amazon is saying I may not get another one because the problem with breakage is bigger than they thought and untill they resolve the problem I won't get one. I've never had anyone refuse to send me something before. I'd have to give Amazon an F for the packing job and try to buy this panini maker from somewhere else.
2,Not so great,"I love Christopher Pike but I did not like this book. The storyline is ok but I didn't like the ending so much. I have read a few of his books before and they were all excellent. The endings were totally unpredictable, this book was different. A few chapters into the story, i had a feeling that Gale wasn't the perfect girl she was poprtrayed to be, and around the middle of the book, I knew she was the evil one. The beginning of the book was good though. If you want to read a GOOD book that is sort of like this one, I would recommend ""the starlight crystal"" by Christopher Pike"
4,"""I am usually referred to as the Master!""","This one is a high note for the Jon Pertwee series, not only for its lively and interesting script, but also it introduces the Master, played masterfully by Roger Delgado. The Master is a renegade Time Lord, always set on dominating earth and killing the Doctor. This first Master story is very good and is still very enjoyably a second time around."
3,i don't want to hear it,"The sounds on this album are great. I love it. Except i do believe that a lot of the lyrics are said as fact, but are actually total bull. I just don't understand why anyone is pushing for anti war at this point, it doesn't make sense. I can move to wisconsin and not get bombed, and push for anti war, but i'm not doing anyone any good... more Americans will die at the hands of terrorists day after day, and the ENEMY will grow larger and stronger, and soon will be able to wipe out this great country of ours. I think they need to find something legitamate to complain about. The left wing point of view has no bearing or reasoning behind it in this segment in the ongoing vendetta. so there."
5,Best CD,"This CD is one of the best cds I have heard in a long time. Anti-Flag is a true punk band. And I have a lot of respect for them. If you like Anti-Flag, you'll like Bouncing Souls too."
2,Not My Style,"So maybe I picked the wrong cd to start with. Who knows, they may very well have some great cds, but I didn't like this one. The first songs were ""ok"" but didn't do much. I don't mind political music, but this one is too whiny. This is the type of music you play when you go on strike because Frito-Lay laid off a thousand employees or something. Plus, I'm not a fan of emo-like voices. If this is what you like, more power to ya."
5,Navy Mustang,"This is a great book, of the shaping of a young man in the 1920's South and the changing U.S. Navy of the 1930's and 1940's. Bill has a remarkable memory and delivers a rich account of the everyday events that molded many of our fathers. His stories of growing up, in familar vocabulary and youthful excitement, are strikingly similar to the stories my own father told but never wrote down. His description of the U.S. Navy of the 30's and 40's was through the eyes of the ever optimistic and overly self-confident young sailor. The book is a colorful description of the service force ships, the support squadrons, and the search aircraft of a changing Navy.It is a delight to read and offers a very positive,humorous and personal perspective of the changing Navy from the ""boot"" seaman, the pilot, and the squadron commanding Officer."
5,Dock your iPod the Pioneer way,"If you want to dock your iPod to your stereo receiver, this is the one to go with. It's easy to hook-up to any receiver. One of the best features is that it charges your iPod as you listen."
4,other scents are better,"I agree that the Masada bath salts are almost magical. The Lavender scent is amazing and real and penetrating. But I am disappointed in the Rain Forest scent. There's an edge to it that is hard to describe: a little perfumey or choking. I normally like Rain scents, too. I canceled my subscription and think I will try the EO bath salts for variety and since per other reviewersEO Bath House Bath Salts, Rose Geranium & Citrus, 21.5-Ounce Bags (Pack of 3)you don't need to use as much for the same effect."
1,Not good,"I usually like Stonewall Kitchen products, so I was excited to see one of my favorite recipe book author lending her name to a product. I finally bit the bullet and shelled out $10+ for a boxed mix and I was SOOOO disappointed! The box comes with three packets - the cake mix, coconut, & ""frosting mix"" (which is just powdered sugar). The cupcakes were okay - they were pretty moist, but I used all the coconut in the cake rather then reserving 1/3 for the topping (I used additional store-bought coconut for the topping). The ""frosting"" was awful - it's the packet of sugar mixed with butter and cream cheese and it was very bad when made as directed. I added in about another cup of powered sugar to make the constancy spreadable and taste right.Over all, the cupcakes were a hit, but for a $10+ mix that makes 12 cupcakes I shouldn't have to buy and add my own ingredients! I could have easily done this from scratch for the same or less money and it would have been just as simple!"
1,Not much substance,I was disappointed in this book. There's not much substance and no new ideas. I teach remedial composition and found nothing new in it that would help me become a more effective teacher or would help my students become better writers.
1,bad news,"For those who lament its permanent removal from the market, Citrucel company has a nice little eulogy and apology written up, reasuring that it was perfectly safe, just didn't sell well. If that doesn't make you feel better about beloved fibershake, note that They did not happen to mention the recall of over 4 million packets of it from 2006 -2008 due to excessive numbers of coliforms! Yuck! Recalls are on recalls.gov or FDA site"
4,Good performance but too short,I know these guys are much older but the concert could have been a little longer but overall a good performance
1,This Book = Not Worth Your Time,"Frankly, not impressed at all with this book nor its writer. Full of fluff and ""truthiness"" (a person who claims to know something intuitively, instinctively, or ""from the gut"" without regard to evidence, logic, intellectual examination, or actual facts). A perfect word to describe this book, coined by our good friend, Stephen Colbert.This book sucked./"
4,"""Where there's a will...""","I an just shocked at most of the reviews from so called fans of the program. This happens to be one of the most exciting regeneration stories ever! If you take account of what happened, the production team did a very good job. The execution, the OTT acting and dialogue, and design is wonderful. McCoy is wonderfully looney. Keff McCulloch's soundtrack is unlike anything to be heard on Doctor Who. Shame on all Who fans who can't enjoy it!"
2,Dr Who pantomime,"Though certainly an improvement over the Colin Baker and Peter Davison 'debut stories', this is not much more than a runaround. The Doctor gets captured, escapes, gets captured again, etc. Overall the idea behind it's okay but it's let down by some truly awful performances. McCoy seems to think he's either in a pantomime or a Laurel & Hardy film. And as for Bonnie Langford's Mel - how anybody is supposed to feel sympathy for such a repugnant companion is a mystery. The Rani dressing up as her is just in the realms of comedy.There are good points - the special effects are impressive and the aliens and sets are well-designed, but they're overshadowed by music more akin to Kids' TV Hour than Dr Who.See 'Mark of the Rani' instead. It was much better than its lame sequel."
3,Little to no Pilates,"This is the second video I have reviewed in as many weeks that advertises a Pilates program but ends up being almost all yoga. Once again, this is yet another variation on the Sun Salutation theme, with some floorwork. The only movement that looked to be ""straight up"" Pilates was the Shoulder Bridge. Other movements were those that had clsoe relatives in yoga- Swimming, Side Plank, Teaser/Boat, a very modified Rollover, and Double Leg Stretch and Single Leg Pull.In fairness, the high proportion of yoga movements were noted in other reviews. However, because many Reformer on the Mat movements are quite similar to some yoga movements, I thought I'd give it a shot anyway. Glad I used the library.It's competently instructed, but there is little to no Pilates."
3,Ok antivirus,"This software has problems with certain programs I have, and causes them to crash. The only plus side is that it doesnt seem to slow the computer down."
5,best virus software,i really enjoy this software it protects my pc better than other virus protections i've had in the past. i do recommend bit defender.
1,THEDOTDOG,"tThis ""Danish"" bacon was actually from Poland cured ""Poland"" style. Not nearly as lean as suggested: 50% fat. Will not reorder this product."
1,CHEAPLY MADE!!,"This item is very cheaply made! Do not oreder from brands on sale! They put pictures on web sites to make costmues look good then send you a cheap thrown together item. Then you pay $10 to ship to your house, $10 to send back and a restocking fee! I mine as well keep this ugly thing because i will be paying more than what the costume is even worth!"
1,Unwieldy,"I purchased the paperback-book sized model. Upon opening the product, noticed the surface was already marred with splotches that do not come out. Also, as previous reviews state, the LightWedge scratches very easily. As for the light switch, the middle one does not work. For reading in bed, although the light is soothing, it is very uncomfortable to turn the page and readjust holding the device.I was really hyped up when I learned of this product (on Oprah) and was going to buy both sizes at once. I am glad I did not. It's a good try, but not quite the perfect book light I was hoping for."
3,mediocre,"these babies have only 80 mg of calcium per tab. I was expecting something a little heftier. They are vanilla flavored, and most dogs will eat them as a treat. the vit D levels are too high in conjunction w/calcium levels.They might work for small dogs, but not for anything over 15-20 lbs."
5,Wonderful Reference Guide,I could not have asked for a better guide! I keep this by the phone for my babysitters and mother-in-law-much easier than explaining what to do if..My sons' preschool also has a copy in each classroom!
2,Nothing to rave about,"This book does not have very good plans in it. Most of them lack much detail in regards to how to construct the project. I didn't find many of the plans to be useful. Most are tired, old plans that have been in other books for 30 years."
2,Not quite.....,This is just an average coffee table book. Nothing special here. It gets an extra star because of the pretty cover. I waited three weeks on a waiting list at the library for this book and I am so glad that I didn't buy it - I would be furious.
5,Beautiful Book,"I'm a longtime fan of Michael Smith's work and have been looking forward to his book for a while-and I wasn't disappointed! ""Elements of Style"" is truly lovely, and perfectly illustrates the highly sophisticated, top-quality interiors he is known for. The photos are lush and nicely laid out, and the text is packed with interesting anecdotes, helpful tips, and inspiring ideas. His work has been shown in my favorite design magazines for years, but it's nice to have something more permanent for my bookshelf; I think this is the best design book of the season."
1,Don't bother,"Mr. Smith has decidedly good taste but most of the photographs in the book are quite poor. I was disappointed with the images due to the dull paper stock. His interiors look much better in the glossy magazines.The writing, however, is painfully bad. To ferret out the few, knowledgeable bits of advice, one must search through useless bits of nonsense.If you want to be inspired, if you want text that is wonderfully informative and if you want an education in design, try Rose Tarlow, Saladino or even Vincente Wolf. These great designers have put a lot of effort in trying to teach us something.I think Michael Smith just took the money and ran with this one."
1,A waste of my money.,"This book was a terrible disappointment. I was looking for ideas I could use. I hoped the author would talk to me about what I could do in my own home. I was hoping for some commentary with the pictures. I was expecting something much more specific and focused from this book, but alas, there was nothing.This book is minimally instructional. I read it carefully and then looked through it again two more times to see if there was a single design principle or piece of advice I could come away with. There was NOT ONE piece of information I could use!Michael Smith must be very busy because I don't think he put much time into this.A terrible waste of my money!!!"
4,Small Job Sandblaster,"Needed this blaster to remove rust spots from my truck. Although initially I thought the blaster was a little weak, I was wrong. It chewed thru the rust and paint right down to bare metal in seconds. I even removes deeply pitted rust. Lightweight, easy to operate, easy to store...make sure you have the right safety equipment on."
2,Book Introduces Concepts/Capabilities in Labview - Not More,"I basically went through the tutor in Labview, and started programming. Now that I'm more 'advanced' I looked to this book for help. I bought this book with the hopes that it will give me some pointers on improving my programming. IT DID NOT.Basically, this book gives a good overview of how Labview works, what's in Labview, and what you can do with Labview. How you can do it it isn't explained. Lots of re-hash of material from other books not Labview related (pages on Fourier transform, optimization ideas *not much*, process control, etc).If you're looking for a book that'll help you do programming, this isn't it. If you're looking for a book with ideas on what you can do with Labview (but with no help), this is the book for you."
4,"""Doctor who? What are you talking about?""","I really found this episode exciting. Never before have I seen such a detailed explication of what it is like to travel through time. Who knew that the simple use of video feedback could transport one so successfully from 20th Century London to 100,000 B.C.?It may not be considered the best Doctor Who story ever, but I really found it interesting. I enjoy the historical aspect of the story--how fire was first used. Sure, it is very unlikely that cavemen would speak English, but I did enjoy how the four travellers reverted into that simple caveman talk.This was a wonderful episode!"
5,SIMPLY THE BEST,"I've played a lot of pinball the last 21 years and think this gets as close as it gets to the real top tables games. Seems the developers, Empire Interactive, spared no expense and the company and this set belong in the Pinball Hall of Fame - a HUGE THANK YOU, Empire!!! Thanks to other fans, there are great strategy guides for Big Race [...] and Timeshock [...]. These play great on Windows Vista and 7 but you may need the patches (email me at jacobson_steel@yahoo.com if you can't find them online). The graphics are incredible even if you don't have a computer screen with a resolution of 1600x1200+ If you can't find a CD for sale, these are currently available for download at [...]Please post a note if you have access to a great Fantastic Journey guide or know of a great PC joystick for these."
5,Love Remy Shand,This is a great album. I surely hope he comes out withe more music soon. He is a great talent.
3,half-good blue eyed soul,"I really like blue eyed soul music. lisa stansfield is one of my favorite vocalists of all time and if you havent heard her definately check her out. in the liner notes of the CD it says he has produced everything and writtten and played every instrument etc... and thats a good accomplishment--- but there are few standout tracks on this CD. it sounds too much like fellow soul singers maxwell or musiq, and ""take a message"" is really the only great standout track on the whole CD. there are a few catchy ones here and there, but its the same recycled melodies repeating over and over throughout most of the tracks. some of the tracks i cant even tell apart. if you are really into this kind of music, id get it, but yet i am too and this just sounds like a bland debut album. but with all of his talent im sure there is room for improvement on his next record. it seems like he has a bright future ahead--just as long as he gets better as time progresses."
5,"Funky and catchy, with no filler material","If ever there were a debut album that deserves a good listen, this is it. Tracks like ""Take a Message"" and ""The Way I Feel"" lead the way with their infectious funk, but the entire set is solid (no worthless filler material here, folks). I've played this one over and over in my car for three months now, and haven't gotten sick of it yet. Remy Shand wrote, produced and performed every track on this album (record company types stepped in to apply some finishing touches), and the personal attention to detail shows. What's even more impressive is that this sophisticated, Motown-inspired sound comes from a white twenty-something from Winnipeg. Proof, it seems, that music comes from a person's soul, not their skin color. Music fans outside Canada may not have heard much about Remy Shand, but rest assured, the secret will be out soon."
5,"Get ready, for Remy to rock you steady","This cd blew me away. I've never really got that into soul or motown music, i'm more of a rocker, but this album is off the hook! every cut is sculpted with passion, musicianship, talent and SOUL. A guy from Winnipeg who wanted to do it all on his own, and has definitely proved he can. Remy plays all the instruments, wrote and composed all the songs and produced it himself. Just knowing that he can do all that will tell you he is here to stay for a long, long time. and how about his vocals? he's got range and feeling. But let me tell you about the album:Whether you want to sit back and relax, get your groove on, or just be inspired then listen to this.From the simple but sweet ""Everlasting"" to the captivating ""Rocksteady"", you'll be moving your head to this.Whether you are a fan of Stevie, Marvin and Donny or just a music lover with an open mind for new sounds, then""The Way I Feel"" could send shivers down your spine."
5,The best $60.00 I ever spent,"I have this exact same model. I purchased it about 11 yrs ago from a CVS Drug store for $60.00. I used it daily when I went out walking. I have never had any problem with it, until recently. I think it just finely gave up the ghost. It was the best $60.00 I ever spent."
5,Philips Jog Proof Discman,"This product has given me nothing but good luck! It is light. It has a great & clear sound with adjustable base levels. It allows for many different options such as repeat song, hold, resume, & etc. I've also found that this Philips brand CD player, in particular, lasts a long time with the standard AA batteries. I can actually listen to 3 or 4 CDs multiple times each and still have a third of the battery capacity left. No other CD player that I've tried, can do so!!"
2,Jogproff.... I dont think so.,"I bought this solely because of the it claimed to be ""Jogproff"", well no, this seems to be misleading, I dont know what kind of testing they did to come up with this theory, but even with a brand new CD playing in it, at most you'll get about 20-40 seconds of continuous music before it starts skiping. I dont know how companies manage to legaly provide consumers with false information about thier products, but hey, I might have missed the small print somewhere.... Im in the process of returning it."
3,"Interesting Concept, Poorly Executed","In reply the review by L. Ferguson, this *is* the show from the 1970's, not the remake. This isn't released yet, so I can't comment on the DVD quality or the extras, but having watched the UK DVDs I can at least comment on the content.... It was created by Terry Nation of Daleks fame. I like the premise and some of the sorts of post-apocalyptic issues that are explored, but much of the series is like a low-budget soap opera, and I'm left wishing they had done better. I especially liked Carolyn Seymour's performance in the first series/season, but apparently there was a falling out and she didn't return for the other series/seasons. Other main characters, locations and even plot lines disappear abruptly, adding to the soap opera feel. The show has cult status among some people who watched it when it originally aired or who are fans of Terry Nation."
2,Thin on instruction,"This video was not a good value for the price. It is 30 minutes for $.... While I am a huge fan of Karen Pryor and operant conditioning for dog training, I found this to be extremely weak with ""how-to's"". I was very disappointed. The Ian Dunbar video, ""Sirius Puppy Training"" gives more information and step-by-step, but is a little outdated."
4,Exhaust goes in and exhaust goes out.,"It is a little tamer than I thought it might be, but then again its on a old Jeep CJ with a straight 6. Good quality."
4,The Golden Greats of the San Francisco 49'ers,"As a avid Football fan, especially the Niners. This video was enjoyable to watch. Here in Holland you only get to see the Euro league games and the Superbowl on tv. Not much, huh. I don't know how US Football fans will regard this video. But this 49'ers, Joe and Jerry fan rate it as one the best! European Football fans, go and get it and watch the team of the 80's play super Football!"
2,DCI Scatter Brain,Vera is pretty much an unlikeable character. She doesn't engage the viewer or the other characters. She has unexplained angst that just comes across as annoying.
2,Vera: entertaining but too expensive for the cut up product,"I really like the character and the scenes. But, either the film was cut in numerous places, significantly, leaving me to think that the film jumped a segment, or....the filming was not smoothly done. Several aspects left me wondering why no segues, and wondering how in the world the film got to where it was. Makes me mad since this is very expensive as episodes go."
4,An Interesting Dectective Series,"I really like the stories and the actors are a great ensemble cast. The writing is creative and Vera played by Brenda Blethyn is entertaining. A nice detective story that you can involve yourself in. Vera can get a little on your nerves and she over acts at times, but the actor David Leon has just the right touch to ground the show and bring it back into reality. Loved both seasons."
4,Fun little player,"Reason it's not getting 5 stars: ugly brown leather cover, cheap earbuds, navigation not the most user friendly and inability to download directly to player from Windows Media player. Price drove me to give this a try: $419.99 with a $50 rebate. For this price, I can deal with the quirks. It does what I need it to and it's enough to satisfy me. I am able to download music by first saving it to the media library then sending the file to the player. Inconvenient but I'll live. In all, it's a decent player with an impressive battery life and memory."
1,Don't waste your money,"If you're using Napster 2.0 (the legal one) don't bother buying this product. You'd think from the description (supports wma files) that it would be easy to do but they don't support drm wma. DRM is Microsoft's way to control the industry and moving a drm wma file to iRiver entails first burning it to a CD, then copying it over to the iRiver device. What a total pain-in-the-$#%.Good luck figuring out iRiver. You have to download firmware and driver updates with instructions written by somebody with a clear lack of understanding of the english language. I've spent 20 years in the computer industry and am a PC expert - but the iRiver support staff was nasty, implying that it was MY FAULT that their system didn't work! Unbelievable."
1,BATTERY,"IT'S A GOOD PLAYER, BUT DO YOU GUYS KNOW THAT YOU CANNOT CHANGE THE BATTERY?. THE BATTERY HAS A RECHARGEABLE LIFE OF ABOUT 3 YEARS, AFTER THEN STARTS TO FAIL TO RECHARGE. WHEN I ASKED TECHNICAL SUPPORT THEY TOLD ME THAT THEY WERE CONSIDERING OFFERING TO REPLACE THE BATTERY WHEN NEEDED, FOR A FEE AT THEIR SERVICE FACILITY. BUT THEY TOLD ME THAT THEY WERE JUST STARTING TO CONSIDER THAT POSSIBILITY AND THAT THEY COULD NOT GUARANTEE THAT SUCH AN OPTION WAS GOING TO BE MADE AVAILABLE. I FOUND COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE TO SPEND ALMOST 400 DOLLARS FOR A PRODUCT THAT I'LL HAVE TO THROW AWAY BECAUSE I CANNOT REPLACE THE BATTERY. I RETURNED THE PRODUCT. BEWARE."
3,Decent flag for the garden,"I bought this flag a few weeks ago. It seems to hold up well to the elements. My only issue is with the size. It's significantly smaller than other garden flags, but it's exactly as advertised."
3,Steelers Garden Flag,"Flag looks nice. Opening to display flag could be a little larger, it was difficult sliding the flag onto the garden holder."
4,A FANTASTIC 5TH ALBUM,This is young dre d's fifth album it has 3 stand out tracks and a couple of other songs which are good there is a fair few guest appearances and has some really great flows it was released 3years after his smash hit album troubled mind which is a west coast classic if you ever get a chance to buy it then do its a great album and will only appreciate in the future
3,sign maker,"Good basic tool. was able to make a passable sign first try, needed to use c-camps to secure frame to item being stenciled. This is a good tool for the ocassional sign maker, being mostly plastic ,wear will be an issue. I would reccomend it for home/light use. It will work very well for the price and will make many signs for friends and family."
1,Great!,"I gave it a 4 instead of a 5 because it's not DVD. However, if you are a Red Dwarf fan, it's a must buy."
4,Good primer for the Northern fly fisherman,"This is a very good entry level book about fly fishing in the North. Somehow we were raised to think of the spinning rod as they key to success in northern waters. Very informative yet not intimidating. Description of remote ""secret"" ponds was very convincing and I imagined myself slapping mosquitos while struggling through the brush to find the right spot. Would liked to have had a bit more detail on the where and how to get there, but I understand the easiest way to make enemies is to publish a book with details on how to find all those hard found honey holes. Fishing friends don't appreciate the company they will find on their next trip. Highly recommend this book for anyone who wants to get started fly fishing in the North Country."
5,Excellent choices,"Victorian Ghost Stories: An Oxford Anthology has some of the best constructed and most chilling stories I have ever laid my eyes on. The characters, the settings, the plots and the dialogue from each of the stories all seem well thought out and written. I never lost my interest and always wanted to ""read just one more page"", from the simple to the complex, each story was wonderful in it's own way. I am sure, that if you are interested in ghosts, or just enjoy a good story now and then, this is for you. This is not a bunch of kiddy stories either, the pages are full of real talent and are portrayed with disturbing grace. I cannot say enough for this book and I am saddened that I am the only one who has written a review on such an extraordinary anthology. Please look into this one, it's worth anyone's money...this is the stuff that needs to be taught in schools."
5,A Picture is Worth a Thousand Words.,"I have just purchased a lot at a new beach development called Watercolor right next to Seaside, Fl and am in the process of learning about the styles of decorating that I like. I saw a copy of this book at the sales center today and thought, wow, this will be a great guide for me. Some decorating books seem kind of over-the-top, but this one is beautiful and some of the looks seem attainable after studying them. I plan to have my own copy soon!"
1,christmas present,"my boyfriend ordered this ring as my main christmas present a week or so before the 25th. On CHRISTMAS EVE you sent a cancellation email. I don't know what happened, but you need to rectify this situation big time. What a horrible thing for you to do on christmas!"
1,Used to be THE BEST...now they use HFCS : (,"For years I was one of the biggest fans of Bull's-Eye BBQ sauce, especially Original & Carolina. Needless to say, I was both shocked and saddened when I recently noticed that Kraft had altered the ingredients by replacing sugar with high fructose corn syrup. I now spend my BBQ sauce dollars on non-HFCS Stubbs."
3,"Overrated, overpriced","I downloaded a trial version from Adobe because I was thinking about upgrading from the free Ulead PhotoExpress software that came with my scanner. In my opinion, Photoshop Elements is easy to use and did a very good job at photo manipulation. However, to my surprise, it didn't really do anything better than PhotoExpress. True, it has some features that PhotoExpress lacks. But PhotoExpress has an easier-to-use touch-up mode for removing scratches and dust, and it also has a more robust ""projects"" section for creating greeting cards and other printable creations. I'll save my money and stick with Ulead, which seems better suited to the typical home/family user."
2,Not for Novice Users!,"This program is full of features and sophistication that Photoshop users have come to love. However, I'm not an experienced Photoshop user. I struggled for hours just trying to understand the underlying principles. Doing things that are simple in other programs--recoloring a box, adding text, putting a background on things--don't feel the least bit intuitive or easy to me because I don't understand the inherent concepts of Photoshop (e.g., layers, palettes, feathering, etc.).If I could return it, I would, and get something better suited for a novice (like Easy Web Graphics) who is also an amateur Web site builder like me. If you're an experienced Photoshop pro, it's an awesome deal. Otherwise, tread carefully unless you're willing to invest hours in learning to be a Photoshop pro."
3,Elements is crippled for left-handers,"I bought the program because I liked Photoshop Deluxe which came with my scanner. I wanted more features. Elements does have nice features but beware if you're left-handed. The Quick Start menu, the Recipes Palette, for starters don't work unless you change your mouse settings to right-handed. This is something Adobe could have easily corrected with a patch. I searched all over the Adobe web site, but alas! there doesn't seem to be a patch. It may be corrected in version 2.0, but if you already have version 1.0 you'll have to buy the newer version to get the fix, if there is one. None of the books about Photoshop Elements including the book that comes with the program mention the left-hand problem. I spent hours installing and re-installing the program until I found out about the leftie problem in Adobe's knowledge base. I will probably keep the program but I don't have kind thoughts for Adobe."
3,Elements Users Guide,"The users manual packaged with Adobe Elements is not quite useless for a non-professional, just getting started digital photographer. I can hardley wait till someone will produce a users guide that it clearly written and walks you through the various steps so as to be able to take advantage of what Elements has to offer. Withy more and more novices such as myself getting into digital photography I am amazed that such a book does not exist and that Adobe does not offer one. For me it is a struggle trying to work Elements and I find myself relying on Adobe 5 for which a claer and user freindly bokk exists. I would not recommend Elements to any one in my situation untill such a manual is available. The frustration is just not worth it ! ! !"
5,The Best I've ever used.,"I design and maintain my company's web site. This is the best I have ever used for preparing images for the web. I used to have to use 3 programs to do to an image everything I wanted. Now, I have uninstalled them all and use this one alone."
4,Well worth its price !,"I upgraded to Photoshop Elements from Photoshop 5.0 LE last week. The package arrived promptly. Yes, there is a manual, unlike some software packages I have(such as MS Office 2001). But, many features are not explained fully in the paper manual (hence the four star rating). I think the program itself is competent enough for most ""prosumer"" level users. My favorite features that are not in the LE version? Unlimited undos, history pallet, editable text, the ability to position image on a page. Feature that I wished included: the ability to save selection. To me, Elements included quite a few very useful features missing in LE. It's well worth the upgrade fee. The program is very solid on my iMac. No problems with working with several 5-10 megs files at a time with the default memory setting."
5,Great reference for U-Boats,One can find most of the information about the u-boats in this book from history to equipments and types of U-Boats to fate of each one. I don`t know if its available from amazon or not but if you are interested on this topic you must get one...
5,A true story that reads like a novel,"This true account of a Mossad heroine is fascinating description of efforts by a group of nine men and one woman, the author, to smuggle Jews out of Europe from 1939 to 1941 prior to the holocaust. Well written!!!"
3,"Amusing, Best Read in Intervals","This book contains a collection of quoted apologies by public figures followed by an explanation of what prompted the apology. Sometimes the funny part is the apology itself, but more often the gaffe is more amusing. It contains hundreds of such apologies; I usually read a dozen or so for a quick laugh, but the effect wears off quickly, so I would put it down for a few days and then read some more.One caveat: Liberals will enjoy this more than conservatives because the authors make their political leanings quite clear in their explanations of the gaffe that prompted the apologies. The authors offer sympathetic explanations for Democratic politicians' mistakes but add snide comments to any statements made by a Republican, and gratuitous shots at Bush pervade the book; it is not remotely subtle."
2,Not my favorite,"The slippers are warm, but the sole is so stiff I literally walk right out of them. If you are looking for warm, usable slippers to wear around the house look elsewhere."
3,A Little Disapointed,"Quick shipping,great sound, and the extra length I was looking for. Only problem is there is no adjustment on the head band. No way of making it any smaller or bigger. If that would have been in the description of the product, probably would not have purchased. Oh well, I guess we'll have to make it work."
1,Horrible!,"I love Dawn French and Jennifer Saunders, but I guess an entire tape of them together, well, I just couldn't take it. I think they're were certain parts that were OK, but on the whole it was awful."
1,Conspiracy theries anibody ?,"Very, very depressing book , possibly written by someone that did not take the time to set down and discuss reality with real Italian people !"
3,Size Is Overrated,"I am a huge Rupert Grint fan. He plays Ron Weasley in the Harry Potter films and I absolutely found it hilarious when he had to wear the hideous dress robes in Goblet of Fire. I mainly wanted this poster because it has Ron on it but when I received it in the mail, I felt a little shocked. I assumed this poster would be the size of a movie poster but it's only a reprint. It's really small and it's probably like a foot long, maybe a little longer. It's not very wide either so if you have your heart set on a full-size, movie theater poster, then you probably won't want this one or the other reprints like it. On the other hand, I really like it just because I'm a Ron/Rupert fan."
5,Fabulous Music Video,"This is a wonderful video! My husband and I can't get enough of it and keep watching it over and over. The selection of songs range from lively, fun tunes to heart-wrenching love songs. Though each artist is unique in style and voice, they harmonize very well when singing as a trio. I must admit my favorite songs on the video are Grace and Boulavogue sung by Anthony Kearns; The Town I Loved So Well sung by Ronan Tynan; and The Old Man sung by John McDermott. I would highly recommend this video to any music lover!"
1,Picture NOT what is sent,"I ordered this small portable walkin greenhouse and was really looking forward to using it this year. What I got was NOT what is pictured. It is the 4 shelf, no space, plastic covered NOT pictured.I was so disappointed. I have not heard back from the seller and have asked Amazon to remove this picture. It is NOT what you purchase.The quality of what I got was ok, but the shape is no where near this picture. Very very disapointed in the misrepresentation by the seller."
4,Refreshing,"This music is reminiscent of the 60's & 70's & 80's, with refreshing new talent added. Easy to listen to, meaningful lyrics and soul-felt tunes. I love it and recommend it to all my friends!"
4,Good but...,"I ordered this kit along with a DVD called ""The complete beginners guide to knitting"" by Nici McNally since I have never knitted before. I'm much more of a visual learner so the DVD helped me much more than this book. However, the book has great illustrations and information. Here comes the but... The kit provides you with everything you need to get started for the projects however I would advise you buy your own size 8 needles. In the middle of my very first project the needles splintered into multiple pieces and I was forced to go out and buy my own before I could finish the project."
5,Excellent for beginner!,"Truthfully I purchased this book because it came with everything that you needed to knit -- yarn, needles, even a crochet hook! And let's face it -- you really cannot beat the price. I also purchased ""Teen Knitting Club"" (though I am in no way a teen) and I figured that one of these two books would be able to help me figure knitting out. The instructions in this book were clear and simple, with arrows pointing where the yarn should go, and I was able to go from not knowing how to hold to needles, to completing a 10 foot long scarf in less than 3 weeks ( I was knitting comfortably in 4 days ). The instructions in the ""teen knitting club"" book were a little more confusing, they did not break each step down into basic steps like this book does. I am surprised that there were so many people who did not find this book helpful; I can't imagine anyone being more awkward at this than I was!"
5,You can't go wrong,Every Red Dwarf episode is just fantastic but they out did themselves in Meltdown. I don't know how they fit so much humour into one half hour. It's a episode of pure enjoyment
2,100% pretty poor quailty,"bought these because they were pretty cheap and after i got them for a while they seemed like a great buy but after a few weeks they just stopped working and im pretty sure they didnt just run out because i didnt use all of them that heavily, no they just produce a weird colored oil substance that doesnt do anything but ruin what im working on"
3,good book,I love the book but I was upset that it came with an old floppy disk instead of a cd. This should have been part of the description.
2,Looked good but drastically disappointed,"The game looked interesting but I was very disappointed with the predictability of guessing the answers to the questions. I would go for the regular version and stay away from the lite version.The object of the game is to guess how your friends would answer specific scenarios. I played it the other day with my family and we all found it very easy to guess peoples responses. Therefore, it took away the exciting debates and discussions that the game is supposed to produce. Stay away from the lite version and go for the regular Zobmondo game."
2,Lesson 1: how to destroy an extraodinary show,"In the first two sesons of House, he was not only the selfish, agreesive, sarcasticc and arrrogant, super mind doctor but also, a human being with a golden heart that hides beneath all those layers of ugliness. At the same time de series never lost its ironic humor that is, most of the time refreshing and provocative.The third season, is complet disaster. It loses the humor and those tininig little things that keep House an human being and not a monster.I love so intensily the first two season as I hated the 3th. It is a dark, selfish, stupid, and intelectual limited House that crumbles like a blind rinoucerous along the episodes smashing and destroying everybody and everything.It looses al the deep and complex personality of the two first season and becomes a one dimension caracter, a cliché, a simplification, almost a markting slogan. Target to whom? Not to me!"
3,"not as good as seasons 1 & 2, but still...","I thought the first half was pretty slow and repetitive, but the storyline improves in the second half and it becomes a House of fun again!"
4,House Season 3,"I am beginning to be impressed by the quality & condition of the videos I have bought. House Season 3 came in perfect condition and is the best season of House yet, I look forward to season 4. It does seem though, in every show they test for LUPUS but as House says in one of the episodes, ""its never lupus"" Awesome show!"
3,"My husband likes House, I'm not crazy about him","I order House DVD's for my husband, not me. I'm into Ghost Whisperer myself. So my review for this dvd, is, it's alright, but not for me."
1,Not A Reel Doctor,Dr. House is stupid and the show makes no sense. I don't think this is a product worth my time or yours. Plus he is super mean to everyone even people he loves how can you do that to people you love it makes no sense. only good thing is it shows people in power who are not male. Cutty (????) is amazing. I love her. The show should be called Cutie because she is.
5,The Doctor is In the House,"As usual, a splendid set to own. Season Three of House M.D. keeps the gold standard that is this franchise. Excellent work by everyone involved and enough extras to be enjoyable beyond just watching the show."
4,Great Show,"Fans of ""House"" should definitely buy Season 3, for overall the show continues to impress with episodes such as ""One Day, One Room"" and ""Top Secret"". There were a couple of weak story threads--while Detective Trotter's investigation allowed an exploration of House's addiction, the show whitewashed the vicious, often illegal, persecutory actions of the cop. And the show's writers merely toyed with the relationship between Chase & Cameron--they should have either developed the idea further or dropped it entirely. But these are minor quibbles. The extras on the set included a Blooper Reel and a Soundtrack Session with Band from TV. All enjoyable, but I wish there was more."
4,Last House on the Block?,"The third year of House, M. D., was as good as the first two, continuing a run of interesting shows about people who are involved with unusual and bizarre medical problems.The formula is pretty well set in stone by now, any victim falling into the clutches of Greg and his team is worse off than anyone suspected, and is bound to get MUCH worse before, possibly, getting better.I'm three episodes into the fourth season, and believe there must have been a change in writers, as the newest batch of shows seems to me to have lost or misplaced many of the qualities of character development which compelled me to buy the full first three years of the series.I recommend this third year season to those who enjoyed the first two years. Whether the fourth year will meet the same high standards of those previous is yet to be seen. Literally."
5,"The series is great, but....","House is by far the best television series out there, but I have a quibble with both the writers and Amazon's Plot Synopsis. House is branded a drug addict, showing a woeful lack of understanding of chronic pain and it's treatment these days. Granted, House should not be self-medicating and should be under the care of a certified pain specialist, but I know from personal experience that that anyone in that much pain needs the pain-killers simply to able to function at a normal level. There is no euphoria associated with pain meds when taken to control pain.So, I would urge Amazon to drop the label drug addict and urge the writers to find another way to deal with House's use of Vicodin, perhaps by showing a more enlightened (and current) view of treating chronic pain. All chronic pain suffers want is to lead as normal a life as possible. That doesn't make us junkies looking for a high."
5,State of Change!,"House is one of the deepest characters on television. The show although formulaic continues to explore its characters. Season 3 represents the end of the triumvirate of Chase, Cameron, and Forman. I highly recommend this show to anyone who hasn't seen it. I know good TV! and House is one of the best shows currently airing! I highly recommend the episode entitled ""One Day, One Room"", one of my top 3 episode of the series. You can't go wrong in giving up your valuable time to this show, sit back and be entertained!"
1,not as advertised,there were deep scratches on 2 disks. 2 episodes could not be watched. they kept on repeating to the start or just hanging.i'm not satisfied with this purchase.
5,Best Colts Jacket I've ever owned,"Nice quality material and comfortable. Coolest ""Colts"" jacket I've owned. I get lots of complements.Only gripe is it attracts alot of ""fuzzies"" on the wool area. I wore this jacket daily last winter and had to use a lint roller almost daily to keep it looking good. It is expected though with this type of material.I HIGHLY recommend this jacket. Buy it now...before they are all gone."
5,"Hilarious, but underrated","A tragic state of affairs: Waiting for God is one of the funniest Britcoms around and yet is so underrated!While the story doesn't sound all that funny (scenes from an old people's retirement home??), this Britcom has it all! A crotchety old bag of a leading lady (Diana's my HERO!!); her faithful, goofy-yet-smart side-kick and friend, Tom; an overly-arrogant, aging, dim-witted, would-be Ladies'-Man, Harvey (don't fool yourself, Harvey); his brainless, doting assistant, Jane; and Tom's witless son, Geoffrey, and lush-of-a-daughter-in-law, Marion.With this mix and more (My favorite is Basil, the over-sexed resident) there's bound to be something for everyone.A brilliant mix of creativity and great acting, Waiting for God is a hilarious romp through old age.If you haven't already watched this great series, give it a try!! It'll be worth it, just for Diana shooting pebbles at squirrels, and her yelling at the poor Portuguese gardner... in French!!!"
1,boring,I thought the instructors were very dull and boring. They also should have showed us some before and after pictures. The models makeover did nothing for me
3,OK,Delivery of product was timely and the quality of the DVD was good. However the infomation on the DVD was insufficient.
2,Broken Virtual Squirmer,"I often look at games coming and going in computer, and yet classic games always make a comeback time & time again for the computer, and the video game consoles. For Atari, they've really been doing this as a routine. For Snap!, they've been using Atari games as their own very low and not as useful. Their Millipede disc is the same as the one that Atari created for the arcades. The game really is alright at first, but you're really wasting your money on this version of Millipede. Even though the game is as addictive as it was years ago, it isn't worth the money buying this CD-ROM version of the classic game. You're wasting nearly $10 dollars for this. Instead, try to get the Atari Anniversary edition for the computer. It may be the same price, but you'll get more classics to play like Pong, Missle Command, Asteroids, Tempest, Centipede, and its sequel Millipede. The Snap! version is a waste of money."
4,This is the map to use IF you plan to drive in FRANCE,"Michelin map played a critical part in ensuring successful vacation. Two friends and I rented a car in AVIGNON - right near new TVG just south of town. We drove thru most of Provence (Luberon and Vauclause) and Cote de Sur (St Tropez) taking many day trips from both St Remy and Crillon le Brave.NOT all small routes are indicated with rt #s - you will see the RT on the map just not assigned #. this proved to be an issue twice with novice map reader.SAFETY TIP if you plan to drive - many designated routes are really one lane - though not labeled as such in actual road signage. be prepared to be gracious about ceding ""right of way""."
4,Good stuff,"This gold is the chrome-looking gold. But really, it is pinstripe tape; there is not really much to say about it. It works. It looks good. It sticks well. I clear-coated it and the paint it was on and that worked well also. I would buy more of this particular brand of pinstripe tape if I needed this or any other color."
4,Entertaining British game show starring Edna,"This is an hilarious concept that carries through pretty well. Barry Humphries (Edna) has some great put downs and one liners. There are six episodes on each DVD so you get close to three hours, enough for a real Dame Edna experience. Enjoyable!"
3,I Nearly Vomitted From Nausea,"If you listen to the film, it's QUITE good.I enjoyed the insights and the atypical approach of Wilson being the Christian fundy.BUT:The camera operator was either hammered, or has cerebral palsy.Seriously...I don't know if it was thought to be ""edgy"", or ""gritty and real"", but the footage, especially in the public speaking clips, takes place during a 6.0 earthquake.I had to watch it in doses.Pretty craptastic to override the content of the message with MTV video style abuse of the medium."
1,Horrible camera work.,"I love the work of Christopher Hitchens and bought this DVD with great expectations. What a disappointment! The camera work was worse than that of ""The Blair Witch Project"". Quick, nauseating pans, jiggly hand-held crap, and bad framing are just a few of the problems. I ejected the DVD about a third of the way through feeling ripped off. As a high school film project, this should have received a ""D"". Bad Christopher! Bad Douglas! The pagans did not win. The Christians did not win. The viewers lost."
2,An Art Film Rather Than A Debate,"As a film, Collision: Christopher Hitchens vs. Dennis Wilson is well made. My disappointment comes from the fact that I was anticipating a debate. What I got with this film has more to do with what is happening around several different debates that Hitchens and Wilson were involved in, rather than a beginning to end debate. I spent 90 minutes waiting for a debate, but all I got was snippets of several different debates.If you want an art film, this one is as good as any I guess, but if you want a Debate involving Christopher Hitchens, may I suggest ""Is God Great?"" http://www.amazon.com/God-Great-various/dp/B002GPNKFE"
5,Great Film!,This is a great documentary and presents both sides well. It is well worth the $10 so watch it and enjoy!
3,"good content, bad editing","Whoever edited this film must have just discovered all the ""cool"" things you can do with Final Cut or some such program and decided to use every effect possible and at random and distracting times. The glitchy, MTV editing detracts from the content and makes the viewer a little sick, when they should be able to focus on what's being said. Maybe the thought was to make this doc with two old guys seem a little more ""hip"" but it's way overkill. To simply listen to HItchens is entertaining and engaging enough."
2,"Hitchens is great, the producer/editor are hacks","I was hoping to watch a great debate, instead I watched someone using Final Cut Pro the way people first used Word Perfect in 1993. The substance that should be here is spoiled by the insane overuse of: video effects; filters; transitions; graphics; etc.I hope someone takes the raw video and makes a movie worthy of Christopher Hitchens. What a shame this is.I'd have given it one star but you can play the film while doing laundry or something else and not watching the actual video and at least Hitchens' wit and wisdom will still get through (although the non-stop edits from one moment to another day to hanging out with Wilson's family, with no discernible flow ruin even a listening experience).Somehow the producer of this film managed to destroy the wealth of material he/she had. I've seen Hitchens several times and believe me, he does not need to be edited at all.Good thing I only rented this."
4,Laughter from the Vestibule.,"This book was a delight to read. It's fairly easy to read (except for chapters such as 'Searching for ""Mr. Right""' when really big theological words are used). The Hafer brothers are funny, even though it seems that sometimes they are trying too hard. Still, the book provides a lot of laughs and there are a few serious messages sprinkled throughout. A fun book that can be enjoyed by the whole family."
1,Not an accurate version,"This version was not accurate in its portrayal of the girls and Marmee. They were so shrill, aharp, argumentative, even in the most tender scenes. The ice-skating scene is omitted in favor of a rowing scene, and many other liberties are taken in the development of the characters. This gentle family, with their ideals and ways of communicating was the highlight of Louisa May Alcott's writing and the BBC version completely spoiled them. We almost turned it off, especially after we had watched three other wonderful versions. Did the producer's read the book, we wondered? Sadly, we could not recommend this version, unless one wants to study its flaws."
5,GREAT,absolutely great! It has def helped me alot and does what it says! would 100% recommend it to women having trouble regulating their cycle
1,Waste of time.,"I was so excited to order this after reading all the rave reviews on this product. I was diagnosed with PCOS (extremely irregular periods) and I was sure this would help us get pregnant. I started taking it on Oct. 21, 2011. On Oct. 26 I had a period. (First one in months) I thought ""Great! This stuff really works!"". Boy was I wrong! That was the last period I had. (BTW, I NEVER skipped even one dose. I took it faithfully every single day at 9 pm exactly)I can't believe I wasted 6 months on this junk when I could've just went to my doctor, gotten Clomid and could've gotten pregnant by now. I just hope at least one person reads this and does not buy this product. Go to your doctor instead. All this will do is waste precious baby-making months!"
2,One of the Worst,Perhaps I need to take a step back from my DS9 readings for awhile. I really disliked this book. I found the authors interpretation of Sisko for example to be completely off. Many times in the book he would snap at O'Brien and show an annoyance with Dax. That's not the Sisko I know.I felt the story was just plain stupid and uninteresting. I just couldn't get emotionally involved or intested in it. 2 stars is actually too generous.
3,"Same plot, different twists","There was a theme for awhile in the books series about the Cardassians always beign behidn some nefrious plot, kind of like 1940's films constantly casting Nazi's as the enemy. Because they had been the enemy but looked at as a whole, it did tend to wear after a while. This one in particular did not advance further, staying within the static bubble of a mission that changes nothing. The stauts quo must be maintained at the end. Also the introduction of the Defiant ship did open up the tv series and the books as well.This book is fun but only passable."
4,a gold country mystery,"Rebeccasreads recommends THE MADD MOUNTAIN MURDERS as an entertaining modern evening's mystery, with a barrel of red herrings & a passel of dead bodies, eccentric prospectors & well-heeled land-grabbers. The heroine takes some getting used to, yet all has a pleasing flavor, rather like an old-fashioned jigsaw puzzle."
5,Love This Product!,This is my favorite new product! My eyes are brighter! I eat a vegetarian/raw diet which also contributes to this...but I was amazed with this. Try this tonic today...every one is different...but if you get the results I did you will not be sorry.
5,Improved Dog's Eye Health,"One of my dogs has eye issues. This product came highly recommended by a friend that has used it for years. Within the few month of using, we noticed her eyes seemed brighter and more clear. It is inexpensive, so it is definitely worth trying. We are now repeat customers and will definitely continue using!"
1,My eyes are so bright now that I can't even find the Eyebright bottle now,According to some reviews it helps dogs and cats. So maybe it's a good idea to test it on animals. Don't get me wrong - I love animals. I just think this product is so useless that it's not going to harm any pets. I am giving this supplement 1 star instead of none (actually I don't think I have an option for zero stars) because now I can use my eyes as a flashlight.
4,A wonderful beginning reader!,"A is for Angel by Debbie Trafton O'Neal is a delightful story and activity book that children will be enchanted with and read over and over. Through rhyme and the alphabet, the author tells the story of Christ's birth. It begins with A is for Angel and ends with ZZZs from the baby, asleep in the hay.Bryan-Hunt's illustrations are bright, colorful and reflect the joyousness of the Christmas story. Children will be attracted as much to the pictures as they are the whimsical alphabet rhymes. At the back of the book are four simple, yet enjoyable activities for children and parents to work on together for their own use or for gifts for special people in their lives.Armchair Interviews says: A is for Angel is a great way for parents and children to spend time together reading about the birth of Jesus and to make memories through the activities"
4,great introduction to EEG,"This is a short and easy to read book, covering the basics of EEG.It is written in a clear and concise way, with emphasis on what one should know of the fundamentals.I had previously read larger books, but tend to loose track of the basics as I kept on reading them. Not so with this book.The mini-atlas is useful and suprisingly quite informative.Recently I attended an EEG workshop and could quite accurately identify most of the EEGs put up.Overall, definitely recommended!"
3,yeah I like it but....,up until this episode I was ok with it... but now that daphne has opened the guitar case and with want it implies... well that is just discrimatory ....all I can do is keep watching... but I hope it is not going where i think it is going... or there will be more negative comments coming on... :( unbelievable ...
2,It's NOT complete!,I love this show but I was very disappointed when I opened it and only found 2 discs containing 10 out of 30 episodes!! The worst thing is that I had to remove the plastic to find out it's not the complete first season so now I can't return it! I guess Volume One is NOT Season one. I was really looking forward to sharing this with my family and friends...now I can't because I don't have the entire season. Bummer.
3,"Great title, interesting book, vague conclusions","Can't fault the author for trying, really - this is a reasonably entertaining tale and conveys a number of interesting points along the way. And frankly, I bought it for the title and the amusing things I'd heard, rather than an expectation of great insight. As long as that's your level of interest, I suspect you'll do fine. There were some good observations made herein about Microsoft's road to power (including why Win95 adoption was so crucial, which will be mirrored shortly by WinXP) and some dubious ones (like why APIs are good but middleware is bad). A mixed bag, and definitely one written in a fashion that makes its name ring rtue, but for all that it certainly has its moments."
4,Very practical recipe book,This is a good guide to cooking with honey and incorporating this local sugar into your diet. Over 200 recipes from Seattle's Pike Place Market honeybee icon Doris Mech.
4,Good text,"I took motors a while ago (last spring maybe) but I recall this text being well laid out, easy to follow and free of errors. Good reference. Added to my permanent library."
3,My review,"This is a informative book, that spends alot of time explaining early Ninja and martial arts mind set. I think it is informative, and it is a compliment to any mind study."
5,WHERE AS MOST SEE; A FEW OBSERVE !!!!!!!!!!............,"I HAVE READ MORE BOOKS THAN MOST; HOWEVER BOOKS WHICH DEAL WITH LEARNING HOW TO CONTROL YOUR OWN MIND;....AND UTILIZE THAT ABILITY NOT ONLY TO CONTROL YOUR OWN MIND; BUT TO BE ABLE TO ""READ"" OTHERS THINKING PROCESSES; TAKE NOTE OF OTHERS ""PHYSICAL-CUES"", AND BASICALLY PLAY ""MENTAL CHESS"" ALL WHILE THE MARK HAS NO IDEA THAT HE/SHE IS TELLING YOU EVERYTHING ABOUT THEMSELFS WITHOUT YOU EVEN ASKING ONE QUESTION !!!!"" UNCONVENTIONAL PSYCHOLOGICAL COVERT WAR-FARE"" ALL WITHOUT SHEDDING A DROP OF BLOOD NOR CAUSING BODILY HARM TO SAID ""MARK""!!! BEING ABLE TO DO THIS;.........IS THE MOST COVETED ABILITY IN EVERY MARTIAL ART! THIS AWESOME BOOK COULD BE ""PRICELESS"" (to those who read AND apply it's wisdom )"
3,Complete?,"There is no acknowledgement of the Romani people's five centuries of enslavement in the book's treatment of slavery, nor any acknowledgement of the Nazis' Final Solution of the Gypsy Problem and subsequent destruction of 75% of Europe's Roma in its treatment of the Holocaust. A distressing omission when the world's 12 million Romanies outnumber several entire geographical nations such as the Swedes or Danes, and Roma constitute the largest and most widespread ethnic minority in all of Europe. Mr. Overy's World History isn't ""complete"" quite yet.Ian Hancock"
4,I love Scene It Harry Potter,"Scene It Harry Potter my favorite game in the whole world! Even if your not that intrested in Harry Potter you'll still love it! I would recomend this to all ages that could understand it, like from 5-adult. Thank you so much for making this because now if I'm bored I'll just take this out and play with it"
5,My review,I am very pleased with the product I purchased. They gave me a product that matched the description very well.
1,Junk - good idea - poor design!!!!,"I tried using this one time and won't touch it again. It is going back! It has about 10,000 holes in the bottom leading you to believe that it should line up with most routers. I tried installing it on my Porter Cable and it didn't have holes that lined up. I ended up using the ""universal slots"" to install it and now it can move on the slots - not the way to install a router base, but I thought I would try it out. It is almost impossible to keep flat, the ""extra support"" is worthless. The whole base will flex just from the weight of the router and be way off vertical... whoever built this has never used a router in their life! Don't even think about buying it. I'm going to make my own offset base I think... the idea is good, but this thing is a ruined woodworking project waiting to happen!"
3,Formulaic Romance,"The pace of character development was far too rapid to make this even sort of believable. I have to confess, I didn't realize this was a romance novel and was disappointed to be immediately launched into a romance fantasy. My fault for not knowing what I'd purchased. I did appreciate Novak's treatment of the ""outsider"" role, but generally found the book to be overly predictable and frothy. I'm not sure the world needed another red-haired vixen."
3,Sjmplicity and efficiency,"The book reached me in excellent condition, within a few days of ordering, at a reasonable price"
4,How Christianity Changed the World,This book exposes the truth behind the institutions of compassion and education that secularism has conveniently eliminated from the pages of history.Knowing these truths opens ones eyes to the reality of true Christianity in our world.A must read for truth seekers.
2,Falls apart after few months,"Fit well for my mgb. Falls apart less than a year under Florida sun. Now need to buy another one, different brand."
1,Unfair,"I believe we have been ripped off by a company that does not care. This is my last purchase from Amazon.com as a result. Not only was the English translation poorly done, but the quality was less than expected; the number of profanities was higher in number than the regular series; and some of the important scenes were altered, leaving out important information."
3,A magic dress?,"Molly has a favorite dress and it has become very worn and tattered from constant wear. When she wears it she can be anything and often includes her cat Slim Enid in her adventures. When Molly is forced to wear a new dress to a ""very important wedding"" she is dismayed, but packs her favorite dress in a backpack to comfort her. What happens next includes a chance meeting with a homeless woman and a miracle of a small girl's belief. I wasn't that taken with the story, noy really liking the illustrations and finding the story a bit simple. I sat down with a friend's little girl and got a whole new perspective, She loved the story! It was this little friend who told me what the story was about, nice things are good, but being nice is always better."
5,it works,"after reading the reviews on amazon i was not going to buy it, but lets be honest you must have an updated computer, the install was a little tricky but i contacted ubi soft and in 15 minutes i was up and running , i had the guy at game stop demo it for me and was impressed, i own just about every flight sim game but the graphics are nice you get to fly over towns and villages in ww 1 plane and take on newer planes the last ubi soft game i bought was heros of the pacific and i was dissapointed but on my first run this game kept my attention for an hour and a half. perhaps the people that complain need to upgrade there computers i use the best ati radeon video card my dell dimension 3000 can handle and have done every upgrade on the system, you do not need to spend 4000 dollars on a gaming computer to make these games that go for 39.00 work. . i was able to manuever the planes nicely even with out the joystick plugged in for the money i paid im very happy with the game"
1,Horrible,This game was rushed to release. 2 Patches over 100M and the game still doesn't work right.
1,Pathetic excuse for a video game,"Don't even bother. Purchased this game for the PC with great anticipation. After all, these are the folks that produced fabulous games like Heroes of the Pacific. But this game is a big-time loser on the PC. It's riddled with serious bugs and a lack of decent joystick support. Even with the 1.02 patch, the game is just impossible to play with a joystick. It's obvious to any monkey that this game was rushed to the finish line, obviously not for the benefit of customers. Save your money. This one is DOA."
5,still my fav,"This is probably not the most accurate translation available, nor is it sensitive to the reader's gender (e.g., ""superior man"" rather than ""superior person,"" conflation of yin with feminine and yang with masculine, etc.). Nevertheless, it's a very intuitive interpretation by Wilhelm and starts off with Jung's fine introduction."
3,Good... Just good.,"This is my fourth digital camera... and my 2nd Olympus digital camera...Pros: Light and small, huge view screen on the back, good clear pictures on screen, but I didnt love the way they came out on paper (even when I took it to a photo center). Super zoom, all 26 settings ensure that you get the right shot... you just have to know which one to use on the spot =0)Cons: I got this camera for Xmas and after my recent trip to Hawaii it no longer wants to zoom. It hasn't even been 6 months! It takes pics with the normal zoom just fine but when I try to zoom in the lens automatically turns in and the camera turns off. I'm not sure why, I kept it in a case the whole time didn't take it near the water/sand, and have not had any accidents. Other than my recent experience it has been great.So far I find myself favoring the Canon models and the Sony models (if you don't mind a slightly larger camera)."
2,"Be careful with this item,","I installed this item and the Bit Defender locked up my computer and made it very difficult to access the internet, email, etc, similar to the way AOL also locks itself into your computer and makes using the computer difficult to enjoy, at best. I had to take the computer to a local ISP technician to clean the computer of all the Bit Defender files and folders. It was a $150 lesson and I would not buy Bit Defeneder 10 again, or trust the Bit Defender company products."
3,BitDefender Antivirus 10.0,Seemed to be very complicated to use. Too much hassle with the spyware feature. Finally gave us and abandoned usage.
3,"Works well, limited capacity","After using the fruit saver for a week it appears to work as advertised, keeping fruit from over ripening. Pears left out turned soft and discolored while those in the fruit saver were crisp. The shape of the machine while attractive limits the amount of fruit that can be stored in it."
3,Fruit Saver,"I bought one of these several months ago because I was throwing away a lot of bananas. Well, it does keep the bananas fresh longer, but I just read in ""Consumer Reports"" magazine it'll cost you [money amount] a month in electricity. It's somewhat noisy, has to run 24 hours a day, takes up a lot of counter space, but doesn't hold all that much. Plus, not all produce does well in it, including the grapes and lettuce that I've tried. It's good for tomatoes, though. I'd say keep your produce in the refrigerator crisper and just remember that it's in there."
5,A PICTORIAL ODE TO PRAGUE,"One of the world's most beautiful cities is exquisitely represented in this splendid volume.Beginning with a breathtaking twilight washed view of the towered city, each succeeding photograph reveals anopther extraordinary work of art within the Hrad or Prague Castle.Its age of glory began in the early 14th century, with the first building dating back to the second half of the 9th century. Today it beguiles the eye in all its Baroque splendor."
4,Easy-to-understand directions for helpful daily stretches.,"This book contains many really good stretches that help alleviate pain and some which help to get you going in the morning. The author made all the written directions very clear and easy to follow. The photos are also very helpful. I've been using these stretches for several months, and enjoy them."
3,Jojoba Test,"This was my first test of Jojoba oil for my hair. I found it to be decent moisturizer, but for all the positive reviews I expected silky, soft hair, I did not get that. In fact, my hair felt oily, as if the jojoba rested on top of my hair shaft instead of being absorbed. I have used less than a quarter of the bottle in over a month, so I know I don't need to use a lot per try so I suppose there is value for money."
4,nice product,This is a nice product..don't use if you have oily face already..I'm not sure if does remove dark spot but it does makes you glowing.
4,Love Jojoba Oil,Good product for my needs. Came when expected and at a very good price than what I have found in the stores.
4,Jojoba oil,I like it but it is to pricey. I will just use my Coconut oil. I mix this with castor oil or coconut for my hair and body. I dont use any lotions. Those lotions are full of chemicals and will not be good for you in the long run.
5,Great Product,I have never used this product before but after reading a few reviews I decided to try it. That was a good decision.
4,good oil,"love it for the curly healthy look,I was looking for shine and this works pretty well...I recommend it,It works well with strait hair too"
5,"Love, love, love...",I purchased this to use as a moisturizer and I love it. I use it on my hair and skin. My goal is to stop using expensive beauty products and go back to using natural items as often as I can. All I can say is it works.
4,Too small,"It is so small, but excellent product. I would recommend it to someone else but check the size before you buy it"
1,Too small for the price,"I got very disappointed when I got this product. I thought it was bigger...it's very small. When I saw the picture, it seemed to be a big bottle; however it is not-just 1oz. You can get a bigger bottom at Sally, whole foods much cheaper."
1,J-U-N-K,This book is JUNK. There is my review. Whoever decides to purchase this trash will certainly agree. Bet it.
3,Too heavy for toddlers,"This item is as cute as the picture, along with being very sturdy. The only issue I had was, I bought it for my 2yr old grandson to use as his trick or treat basket, but it was far too heavy for him. For some reason, I was thinking it was made of vinyl or plastic...not ceramic. Product its self, is great....just needed a little more of a description, or maybe I should have read more about it!!"
3,"Actually, a bit tedious.","Three of these four songs are past the 10 minute mark, so you'd hopefully hope there's enough interesting soloing to hold your interest. There isn't quite, though. Joe Morris spends most of his time doing one-note plucking sort of sounds, and I've nver been one to appreciate the violin sound in Jazz. Regardless, the dark brooding sound employed by this album does make for nice background music. This is another one from emusic.com. I'm not sure I'd pick this one up in the stores if I had to, although it's nice that Amazon has other titles by Mr. Morris."
1,Recall snafu,"I'm not writing this review of the food itself, which is very good, but about the recall. This product is part of the recent voluntary recall due to potential salmonella contamination. When I get a new bag of dog food, I pour it into a tub that's kept closed near the food bowls, for ease of serving and insurance against my dog getting into the bag. The bag goes into the trash. And for this recall you have to have the bag to be certain that your batch is or isn't involved. Without the bag, nether the manufacturer or distributor will do anything except to tell you, ""when in doubt, throw it out."" My feeling is that the manufacturer, knowing that I ordered during the time in question, should offer to replace my food, but that was not the case. If this weren't the food my trainer recommends, we would be changing brands."
3,Yet another classic Pike novel,"This book begins simply set in the small town of Madison in the middle of the desert. There 4 friends discover a black puddle at the bottom of a mine shaft. The mine has been closed down for years and is even being investigated by a group of scientists. When one of the boys is infected with the black liquid he begins to change, for the worse. He becomes a robot like monster who eats glass and kills his girlfriend and buries her in the desert. Like all Pike novels there is a lot of blood and gore. Then he threw in the Sio character and things got confusing. The alien who wanted to destroy humanity for no other reason than her own pleasure and to see men suffer. The climax and finale of the novel are a little predictable and not unexpected. This book would probably intrigue young adults who are looking for a little scare, but this is not Pike's best horror novel to date."
2,WHERE'S THE REAL ENDING?,"Now, I have read many Christopher Pike books and I was really looking forward to reading this one. So when I started it, I thought it was great, you know, one of those books that really holds your interest, and I read it right through the night. Then came the ending and I thought ""Oh dear"". This really really good book was totally ruined by a crap crap ending. I'm very sorry, but don't do what I did and loose a night's sleep reading it, because it's not worth it. Get your sleep instead and read a classic Pike book, like Chain Letter."
1,Just not enough,"You're kidding yourself if you think you'll learn anything from this book. There just is not enough information to actually learn anything. It's simply seven short ""lessons"" focusing on travel phrases."
2,Ring Tone,"I bought this product for my son and the ringer is so low that he never hears it ring. It is a sleek phone, but what good is it if he never hears it!"
3,Not for easy guitar,"If you are still playing easy guitar (like me), then you might want to consider the Ultimate Guitar Chord book (also by Hal Leonard).In my opinion, it is easier, requires no fingering above the 5th fret, and only a little bit of barre chording (not all 6 strings ... usually just 4 strings). Although the Ultimate Guitar Chord book is 'larger', it only has ~8 pages (much thinner), and it stays open (unlike the Incredible Chord Finder).However, if you are an intermediate/advanced player and have no problems with barre chords ... then this book is for you (4-5 stars)."
1,DOA,"Bought 2 of these neither worked. Both had a charge but something wrong with the wiring which refuses to power or charge a psp. have one opened up now trying to tinker with it, purchased these from RWCI"
3,An okay camera,"This camera is very handy. I am impressed with the different settings and it is much easier to record action than my previous digital. The software included is not nearly as handy as the Camedia software I've used in the past. And although I haven't had any photos commercially printed, the color and the quality of the prints I have done at home is not what I expected. The pictures tend to be pretty grainy and I have had to do a lot of editing. Overall, it is very easy to use. I hope that with continued use the problems I'm having will be resovled."
2,2 flaws too many,"The good news: Pictures are excellent. The bad news: to reiterate what others say, it eats batteries - and getting rechargeables does not solve the problem. I went on vacation with 2 10-packs of batteries, and used 10-12 batteries (vacation was 10 days, took 300 pictures - the 512MB card holds over 400). The second flaw is the lack of a viewfinder - in bright sun, you just can't see the LCD screen. Also, a note for the bifocal crowd - I have to take off my glasses to be able to see the screen well. I got the comparably-priced Canon Powershot A430 (1 less megapixel) for one of my children, and it seems like a better choice."
3,"Slow shot-to-shot, eats batteries","Slow shot-to-shot and seems to eat batteries. However, the image quality is great. I recommend purchasing a 1GB XD card, which will allow you to capture and store 1000+ 5MP images. To eliminate the battery problem, I purchased cheap 2600mAh 1.25v NiMH rechargeable batteries from Fryes and the camera can now remain 'on' for hours."
5,Corningware MW-20,"The ""hot plate"" with this product isn't really good for heating a can of soup. I would have expected it to heat a can of soup off the shelf in an hour or so. I've found that if you want the soup fairly warm you had better put it on to heat 4 or more hours before you are ready to eat. It will keep a heated bowl of soup hot for as long as you want. But what is the purpose of having this ""hot plate"" if you have to heat the soup in the microwave first?"
5,Fantastic for the price,The Garmin Quest system suits all my navigation needs. It came recommended by 3 work colleagues and is a wonderful product for the price!
2,Inaccurate to a fault,"Although the unit's small size was attractive, the routing accuracy and verbal cues were awful. In our tests in the San Jose area, the unit was unable to direct us correctly to our destinations and the verbal instructions and chimes were of little help. It prompted with cues like ""Turn north in 1/2 mile"" not mentioning whether it was a left or right-hand turn. The chime was no help either.We returned it and purchased the Magellan Roadmate 800, a more expensive unit but very accurate, with prompts and chimes that are terrific. I highly recommend this unit."
5,The Quest,"This GPS is absolutely amazing, easy to use, easy to load. I'm extremely impressed with the product!"
3,NOT a point to point GPS !!,I bought this GPS. Had to return it the same day. It won't let you enter a destination!!
5,Georgeous book and a great story,"The illustrations in this book simply couldn't be more beautiful. It's spectacular to look at, and my son thinks so too. He loves pointing out each of the animals over and over again, commenting on colors and the sun.The retold African folktale is a great read, a good sequence of events, and a good illustration of logical consequence. My only argument (and this is with interpretation rather than the book itself) is that: a)nobody asks the mosquito what happened and b) what the mosquito tells the igauna in the beginning isn't a lie. It's silly and irrelevant, yes, but she's not lying. The farmer was undoubtably digging up yams bigger than the mosquito. Maybe it's just my sympathy for the underdog here, but I think the mosquito got a bad deal."
1,Teaches to blame one thing and not everyone who made assumptions along the way,This is a horrible book. Blaming the mosquito for all that went wrong is just like a gang or bully situation. Let's all blame one mosquito instead of all the animals that were involved with THERE ASSUMPTIONS.This book teaches us not to take responsibility and to basically pass the buck.Definitely one of the worst books I have ever read. I do not personally believe this teaches a good lesson to children.
4,It's the 50's All Over Again,"When I was a child growing up in New York City, one of the programs I just loved was The Goldbergs. I suppose it reminded me, to some extent, of my own family; the closeness, the trial and tribulations, the joy in sharing happy moments and yes, even the smell of mom's cooking. Gertrude Berg was an innovative lady for her time and she brought the warmth of the family unit to the screen. This series, although not the original programming set in New York City, takes the Goldbergs to the suburbs of New York. Once again, we get a glimpse of family life and with it the feeling of nostalgia and a time gone by. Even if you're not a New Yorker, anyone can relate to this series and walk away with a good feeling."
4,A Good Read On A Different Subject,"This is an interesting premise for a book. A pastor leaves his church for a period of time, letting one of his mentors hold down the fort. And revival breaks out. The Holy Spirit begins to move in a massive way and lives are changed. The plot is a bit more complex than that, but the fascinating thing about this book is the idea that this sort of thing could happen in your town. Moeller does a fine job describing the roots of a revival and what one is actually like when it takes place. In the end it's a unique and enjoyable read. Four stars."
1,Never Got One That Worked,"Bought one, the toaster only toasted on one side. Amazon sent us a replacement, the toaster didn't work at all. We're giving up and buying a different brand."
2,only for taking out large object only,"I'm very disappointed in this product, the pore size of the net is so large I cannot really clean my turtle's left over stuff down at the bottom of the tank, I think this is designed for scoop out the fish or for large object only :("
1,Do Yourself a Favor,I bought this camera at COSTCO about 2 years ago for about $[...] which was about $90 more than it is worth. It has many great features that attracted me and could have made it a great camera but the shutter lag and memory write speed make this camera almost useless. Battery life is also an issue. Even if it didn't have these flaws it would be a $[...] camera at best.Do yourself a favor and don't get ripped off. Spend your money on a good camera.
3,You sent the wrong book.,"I ordered the book above but got one with a similar title and subject, ""Golf Made Simple."" I would return it but I just don't like going to the post office."
4,The Simpsons Comics on parade,"If you like Simpsons Comics, be sure to get this book. I personally think it is the best of the Simpsons comics. The storys are so funny and the book has so much to offer."
3,"Nice, but has an odor","I really like the ottoman, color and style, but it has this distinct odor that has really made me rethink this purchase."
4,A good purchase,"It is what I was looking for, It works very good, It has several playing modes, it is small. But I was noticed a problem in the LCD screen in the last days."
5,Great for Big Families,"I have used make a mix for many years. With 4 children and a hubby who appreciated good food, I put this book to good use. It saved lots of money and also time. I could always make a simple meal extra special with a make a mix muffin or impossible pie. Thank you to the authors of this book!"
1,Radio reception error,"Nice sound and good reception of weather channels, but radio constantly gives a weekly alarm with ""radio reception error-listen to broadcast"".An emergency alert radio from a different manufacturer does not give false alarms. Poor design for automatic alerting feature defeats the purpose for having a radio with an alarm. Returning the unit for refund."
1,Absolutely Horrible,"I must say, this is one of the worse Star Trek books I have ever read. The plot seemed to be good, but the way it was written it could not keep my interest/attention. After reading over 50 Star Trek books, I would say skip this one, as it's not worth getting it."
2,Horrible Picture Quality,The picture quality is very grainy and blurry. I compared the images to the DVD copy of the same movies and the DVD copies of these movies had a much better picture quality. Don't waste your money on this set.
3,Enjoyable,"Still love the TMNT. We watched it with the kids growing up. Ordered it for theyoung kids in the family and they, too, enjoyed the show."
3,More used than expected,"I purchased this movie set used but the box and movies covers was less than expected, however, the price was right."
2,read escott instead,"really just an unneccesary book. Totally a rehashing of Colin Escott's book. cant believe someone published it. some worthwhile moments, but not really a book id recommend."
5,Very informative and emotional.,this book is great for taking you thruoght the life and times of Hank and the music industry of the time. I will be reading this book again and again.
5,'Brassey's Modern Fighters' book review,"As with the other books I purchased, this too is excellent. Being an avid model builder (among other hobbies and interests), I rely heavily on books, magazines, the internet, for images for color schemes of the models. I have a vast collection of books with information photographs of world aircraft. This book is one of them. An excellent addition to anyone who engages in that hobby."
5,great brush,This brush is a must to clean out the inside of your AR. It is made with a durable material and cleans well in the area where th bolt carrier seats. I would recomnd this product to anyone
5,The Day You Were Born,Very Interesting reading - a real window to understanding who you are and why you take the actions you do in life.
3,Missing and overlapping days,"The book is good and many times right on, but i noticed that there are days missing. May 21 and 22 are nowhere to be found. There are also days that overlap. Nov 23, 24, 25, 26, and 27 are listed in both Scorpio and Sagittarius. I skimmed over some other pages and could not find an explanation for this meaning it was some kind of error, an error that is a big deal to people born on those days, especially may 21 and 22 because apparently they don't exist."
2,Embassy leather purse ... comes unstitched !!,"thought this would be a great handbag because of zippered/velcroed compartments [the so called ""gun section"" is perfect size for 4x6 photos of the furkids]after about a month I noticed that all the seams were opening.now, I do carry a lot of stuff, but have had leather or faux leather bags from Penny's or Target last YEARS carrying the same assortment of things."
1,Endless remakes,"There's some pathetic music on ST. CLAIR's ENDLESS SUMMER: SUNSHINE PARTY.""Hawaii Five O"" sounds NOTHING like the original Ventures hit single and ""Wipeout"" does just that: they actually use electronic simulation for its all-important drum solo!One word: UGLY. Best you avoid this one."
5,An enjoyable must-read for all divers,"This book is a very good reminder for all of us of how important safety is. It also points out that almost accidents, if not all, can be avoided and that should be done in the first place. The way it is written is also very enjoyable to read through. Highly recommended!"
4,Blackjack shoe,"Easy to use, works well. Much better than trying to hold on yo 6 decks and cards going everywhere! Good investment."
2,"Love Gram, not this book","Contrary to other reviews found here, this is not the ""definitive biography"" of Gram Parsons. That honor belongs to Sid Griffin's loving (and out of print) biography. This is a poorly written, passionless, classics illustrated story of Gram's life- lots of whats, but few whys. We'll all keep hoping for Sid's bio to be re-released. In the meantime, try wikipedia."
2,Looks great but food scissors work better,The tools look great (it's Combi!) but I don't get much use of it. I have a pair of small food scissors with cover which is much easier to use.
1,Just a cheap toy,"A good idea, but they cheaped out on the manufacturing. It looks good in the package, but really isn't. Once I got it home and cut it out of the blister package, I could see and feel that it was junk. It fits none of my tools well, and is neither safe nor accurate. Low quality, flimsy plastic and soft, easily bent metal with a lot of slop, even before it is installed on the tool.I checked it out on my USA Skil 77 and my neighbor's Chinese version. It is a loose and sloppy fit on both of them, as well as our jigsaws. Even if it fit the tool well, the head has a fair amount of play.Pass this one up."
3,Decent but some parts did not fit,"It was good for the price. However, one of the rods did not fit at all in my Makita saw. Upon close inspection, I noticed that it was slightly thicker than the others. The part that fit worked fit, though a bit flimsy. But that's what I expect for the price."
1,Trash,Won't even begin to mount to my saw with included hardware (Bosch jigsaw...it was supposed to). flimsy anyway.
4,works wonders!,My baby's doctors recommended this to increase milk supply. 610mg 3 times a day... I was skeptical but not anymore! I overproduce for my preemie daughter now and love it!
1,No increase in milk,I tried this because I had been reading it would increase breast milk but it didn't do anything for me.
2,Would love to say it worked,"I am a mother who had been successfully exclusively breastfeeding for over three months. I noticed my supply was getting less and less and was told by a couple of people said to try this herb.As I said in the title, I really would love to say it worked for me, but after taking this product, as directed, in hopes of boosting my milk supply, it failed to deliver. I am not saying it may not work for others, but all it did for me was make me smell like maple syrup, and not in a good way.Maybe it will work for you as it has for others."
4,helpful for breastfeeding,"I wanted to breastfeed my son as long as possible, but I felt my supply was diminishing after only three months, and several sources pointed me to try fenugreek capsules. I ordered them, and before I received them I was supplementing one feeding a day with formula. After I started taking them, I noticed that I was able to pump more and my son seemed less hungry. (The one catch to this is that I was also drinking more fluids and pumping frequently also to help increase my supply, so I'm not 100% sure that it was because of the fenugreek, but there was a definite correlation there.) They taste kind of funny, sort of like maple syrup, and gel capsules are a little weird, but well worth it for the health and financial benefits of exclusive breastfeeding."
4,It Works,"I have to say that I was skeptical at first to try, but the pediatrician gave me the go ahead to take it. My baby was highly allergic to baby formula plus she was a tiny baby. I had to find something to increase my milk supply to help increase her birth weigh quickly. I read every amazon review and I want to write one to also help another mom. You may or the baby may get gassy but no pains...every baby is different. This Fenugreek capsules works! It definitely increases your milk supply. If you are an organic fanatic, they sell it too but both capsules look identical. Good luck to all the nursing moms."
2,No so Good,"I bought these with the hopes that it would increase my milk production. While it did increase my production just a little bit, it left my breast milk with a strange odor. I also noticed that the baby began to become very fussy after feedings... so maybe a slight reaction to the herb, so I discontinued"
2,We Don't Get What All the Hoop-la is About,"If Children had coffee tables, Tana Hoban's books would probably be on them. That said, my children and I don't get what all the hoop-la is about. Sure, the pictures have that artistic 'grittiness' that one often sees in photos hung in galleries, but really, how many young children find that style appealing!?!In particular, in this book (as compared to Toban's ""Dig-Drill, Dump-Fill"") the photographs don't even seem that inspired. The cat lying on the car hood is just that; a tabby on car's hood.Two stars- Some pictures are interesting but definitely take a look at it in the Library before purchasing.Pam T~[...]"
2,Verbatim 95386 HP Q6511A Laser Toner Cartridge,"I've been using this toner cartridge for about 2 months. I print less than 30 pages a day on an HPLJ2420d printer. In the past month it has begun printing very darkly. This is not a big deal with text but when printing images it makes them so dark that they are unusable. Also, about once a week I get a supply memory error on the printer that has to be cleared by punching printer buttons repeatedly. I wouldn't buy this cartridge again."
3,Doesn't play on my computer,"Although it states it is a DVD, my computer's DVD player can't play it (PowerDVD). I have a BluRay system set up with a player (that supposedly plays everything) which is able to play this. It's not bad but there should be some indication that it's in some special format, hence the low rating."
3,Short and Sexy,"This collection of short stories cleverly spins off from a movie theater where patrons have watched a movie about ""the scene"". We follow several couples of different orientations back to their homes where they play out fantasies inspired by the film. Some of the characters seemed more fully developed than others, but this is a risk in any short format. Likewise some of the stories were hotter than others but this could be personal taste. Overall there should be a story to interest almost anyone."
3,My battery door broke too,"I've had this camera for about a year I guess, and I do think it's good for every day use. I've been happy with the picture quality. I did have the battery door break after a few months though and had to replace that."
1,DO NOT USE THIS !!!,I have inquired about this to an avian specialist.. and she said that it is not good for the birds feet .I am not saying that people who are using this for their birds are at risk . Please check with your avian specialist before you buy this !!!
2,NOT COCKATOO PROOF!,"This product is not very well designed for the smarter bird... the cord that connects the perch to the outlet is too easily assessable for cockatoos. Mine chewed through this cord and it was only in his cage for two days, he figured out he could stick his foot through the cage and pull the cord inside of it and proceeded to chew it in half. It was still plugged into the wall mind you when he did this. I do NOT advise anyone with a cockatoo to get this perch. It needs to have a better design, like maybe a SOLID metal sheath around the cord section that is close to the cage instead of the wire mesh thing... because that is just not bird proof enough, and not to mention dangerous. Obviously I can not return the product, so now it has been stripped of wires and is just a normal perch :/"
2,Perch is too slick for my bird to feel secure.,"I would recommend this to anyone that has a bird that isn't afraid of slick perches. I bought this over a month ago and I was told that he would gravitate to it eventually. Nope...he loves the warmth of it, but will not stand on it because he can't get a good grip on it. It's like slick plastic. If they made one that had a better grip I would definitely buy it, but for now. I have to swallow the $54 bucks I paid for it and put it away."
4,Heated bird perch,"I am in alaska and this is a must for my feathered friend. However the surface is very slippery. He cant stand on it at all. I had to wrap it with something that he could stand on. This doesnt get hot enough to burn, and when its really cold out I find him sitting on it alot. As far as the cord goes, I can't give an opinion to it being unsafe. However mine doesnt look at it."
1,Irresponsible parenting,"Both the author and anyone who exposes young children to this polemic know that they are engaging in irresponsible parenting. Young children do not understand the nuances of political debate: indeed, everything to children is either good or evil. I know the folks who might consider buying this book - and the author herself - would not condone having their young children see movies like ""Birth of a Nation"", or read books like ""Help Mom! There are Jews in the Closet"". This type of book is similarly dehumanizing toward a group of people based on their beliefs, and this type of intolerance is a threat to our democracy."
1,OMG!,"I was hoping for a laugh, but there's no humor to be found here. This is simply an ideological screed, nothing more than a book-length temper tantrum, and a very sad commentary on the level of political discourse in the US.The only thing sadder than this book is the thought that someone might actually think it should be read by children."
1,"good for a laugh, but i wouldn't give it to my kids...","I read through this at the store. It was pretty fun- it reminds me a lot of the kind of pro-American, anti-Soviet propaganda that you can find easily around now, though usually in video form. I definately reccomend reading it for the laugh-value. I don't reccomend paying hard-earned money on it, not unless you're doing an experiment on indoctrination, etc. I could see how it'd be fun to analyze in a polisci or psychology class. Fortunately, it's not at the public library system where I live, but then again, nor are these evil commie indoctrination books to which the publisher refers singing the praises of gay sex or doing drugs. But if I ever come across either of those, I can only pray to the Lord that they'll be as hillariously transparent as this!"
1,Bizarre,"What kind of decent parent would want to drag their four-year-old into the idiotic ""culture wars"" of bad liberals versus bad conservatives, both of whom are out to ""destroy America""?The most valuable thing you can bequeath to your child is a free mind. If conservative principles are indeed salient, you shouldn't need a little propaganda book to help your very own Tommys and Lous.These political indoctrination ""children's books"" are just another event in the tit for tat argument-for-arguments' sake wars between a generation that - deep in mid-life - has yet to grow up.I'd prefer the 4 year old opinion on this nonsense to the authors' It's probably more insightful."
1,Teaches children how to stereotype...,"Who came up with the brilliant concept to divide our children? As if this nation isn't divided enough, Katharine DeBrecht has decided to bring her ""children's book"" into classrooms and homes and divide children all over the nation. Firstly, children are not capable of advanced political thought, that's why children are not allowed to vote. Secondly, as an educator, I don't discourage basic political questions and concepts, but I would discourage any book filled with hateful undertones, and stereotypes such as the ones displayed in this book. The world is not black and white, there is plenty of grey- this book obviously neglects to mention that. I'm a libertarian so quite frankly, I don't care much for liberals or republicans, regardless hateful political books are useless for both children and adults.The book also uses a great deal of sarcasm, which I think is the lowest form of humour."
1,what neo-cons really are...,"this book only proves that the neo-cons are what the rest of us see them as.... a bunch of name calling idiots. mommy mommy, theres a dumb republican under my bed.......this book is stupid and written for the dumbest of the dumb. have fun reading this rubbish....."
5,I love it!,"As soon as I heard about this book I googled and found it first on Amazon.com. I couldn't buy it fast enough. Finally! Finally a childrens book that offers another viewpoint in a funny, satirical, intelligent way. I hope the authors make millions! Maybe that will encourage them and like-minded publishers to put out more of this stuff. I bought it and will email everybody I know to do the same. Heck! For $11, it's a no-brainer."
3,"Disappointed, but okay with it","I bought this just before taking possession of a 300SD. This manual is for the 123 series frame, not the 126 series chassis. But, a lot of the information still applies, except the electrical diagrams are of little or no use. The discussions on the body work are ok. Some of the pictures leave a little to be desired, as you would expect a bit more from a manual that is based on a complete tear-down and rebuild. Next time I'll buy the Chilton"
2,Not As Good As Remembered,"Unfortunately, with the exception of their signature number (Why Do Fools Fall In Love), the remaining numbers in this album are so repetitive and simplistic in structure to become irritating. So,I will be relegating this CD to the storage zone."
1,Watching Paint Dry,This was the slowest movie that I have watched in a long time. Who ever handled the marketing did a fabulous job....they fooled me!! The only reason I watched it till the end is because I had paid for it and really hoped that eventually it would get better but it did not. Thumbs down for this.
1,All About Us...,....is really not about ANYTHING! Bottom line i bought this movie because Boris Kodjoe was in it! Never again will I do it! I'm willing to give this movie away for free!
1,Holy Cow is Awful,"As a stickler for clean glass in my car, I have been trying all sorts of products. Holy Cow is the latest, and I am sorry to say, it made an absolute mess of my windows. The stuff claims to be streak-free, but its next to impossible to get the streaks out. Try as best I am able, it not only left streaks, but the inside is a blotchy mess. The stuff simply dries incredibly fast (and dries out your skin too), but it does NOT leave you with clean or streak free glass. I will return the unused portion and demand a refund. This stuff is absolutely awful."
1,Unknown to M.Cardona,I would be happy to write a review since I am the subject of the biography. However I did not know of its existence nor do I have a copy of it. I have some objection to buy my own biography. Could I get an electronic copy for free?

5,"Get it, read it and start living your life","This little book changes the way I view everything: myself, people around me, and the world. It is a very simple and easy-to-read book, but it contains some of the most profound revelations I have ever come across. If, like me, you have always felt somewhat dissatisfied with certain aspects of your life, but can't figure out what you need to do in order to feel validated, joyful and content, then this book will give you the tools to fix things for yourself. It has taught me to not rely on other people to make me happy, and that ultimately, true happiness comes from within ourselves. It contains exercises which you would need to do in order to benefit from this book fully. Probably the only self-help book you'll ever need. Everything else you can figure out for yourself with the help of this book. I am surprised it has only one review so far. A hidden gem!"
3,Good Little Scrubber,"This is a glorified face scrubber. Not that I hated it, just that I like to call things like they are.When I think I need a good scrub, I turn to my Artemis set.My complaint is that when on and scrubbing, the head tends to fling the facial scrub back and into my eyes.I love the scent of the facial scrub though. It's very relaxing.All in all, it's an alright buy for the money."
3,Diabetes Health Pack,I take a pack everyday. Can't really say if they work or not. No great spurts of energy. A little pricey but I enjoy the convenience of having stuff shipped to my house. I guess one vitamin is just as good as the next.
3,It's alright,Gel ball is very hard to squeeze for my hand. Was recommend to buy it after my hand surgery it i can't really squeeze it
3,A Mediocre Blend,"I came across Pure Moods I and loved it. I decided to try the latest of the Pure Moods ... and to be honest can't really decide if I like it or not. It does have some compelling songs on it ""Only If"" by Enya. (Anything by Enya is wonderful) and I absolutely love the surreal song ""Life in Mono"" by Mono and David Lanz's ""Cristofori's Dream"" is simply beautiful. Both songs by Enigma and Sarah Brightman are good. I would say out of the 16 songs I only like 7 of them. I'm wondering if buying the CD was worth it when I probably could live without all of them (with the excepting of ""Life in Mono"")I might grow to really like this CD - but then again I might not. It's one of those mediocre types of CD's that you just can't hate but you can't love either. If you want to take the chance on a battle of ""should I keep it, or toss it"" then by all means buy it. But keep in mind you could find that one song that just speaks to you and compensates for all the other unremarkable songs."
1,rusty pie chain weights,"I don't know if it is the manufacturer or the retailer, but I got a rusty set, tried to find the retailer (showed a different name when I looked for their website)--disconnected phone, had to file a complaint with Amazon, which got a rapid response by phone and new product shipped...rusty again!!! Yuck!Rust pie is not an option..."
1,Doesnt work on current PC's,"I'm certinly in no way giving this game a bad review, for me Daytona USA is the greatest racing car game ever biult.The reason I rated this 1 star is unless you have windows 95, this game is not going to work for you. Nor does the original Daytona game for PC.There are ways to use emulators for the older dos systems to run these programs, but unless you look into that and can understand it, you may find yourself with a game that will not even install on your computer.Here's to hoping sega get around to re-releasing a bigger and badder version for the PC in future."
2,Indestructable? No.,"The mouse may be tough, but that is of no help when its cord breaks off- which is a given. This happened to 3 of these, so it's not an anomaly. Also, the glide pads underneath come off very early in its life."
3,A little too tight,"This hat covers all of my hair nicely (and I have a lot of hair) and it looks nice, but it gives me a headache."
5,Recommended Book,"""I...consider a copy of this book a must for every institutional and personal library."" (Journal of the National Medical Association, March 2003)"
5,Great for walking the dog,"I bought this in order to free up my hands while walking the dog in the evenings.There are other dogs to worry about and my dog is old so he cannot really defend himself from dogs whose owners let them off of their leash.I know carry the leash in one hand and a stick ( to protect my dog) in my other hand.You don't have to worry about aiming it as it points where you look,Very lightweight and comfortable"
4,Well made,Works well to see in the corners while cleaning the pellet stove out. Have not used it for any other task yet.
4,Good head lamp,"It is a good little head lamp, certainly bright enough, too bright ate times. It has two brightness settings. Over all it has been a great investment I use it all the time while working on my truck, and also around the house doing honey-do's.The only downfall I have found is the beam, and battery. The battery will last about about 3-4 hours on the higher setting. And it would be fine if it took normal AAA or AA batteries, but it takes a special camera battery and cost about $8 each time to change the batteries. The other fault I found was that you can not adjust the beam, it would be very helpfully if you could adjust the beam from spot to flood.Overall still a good sturdy head lamp."
5,I love it!,"I needed a new drill for a couple of big home renovation projects and bought this based on the review in fine homebuilding. I was also attracted to the fact that lithium-ion batteries are a lot less toxic to manufacture and dispose of. the drill has been fantastic-- even better than i hoped. great power, balance, ease of use, and battery life."
2,overpriced/overbranded,"good ergonomics and good weight balance, fits nice in your hands as long as you do not need to use it.. . An expensive electro-mechanical device. Transmission clutch went after two years of very light use - Initial price is forcing me to repair it for a hefty amount. I bought in the meantime a corded drill for 60 $ which does the job for the time being. While shopping for the transmission replacement part, I came across a one page dissertation/review from a makita owner/employee overly praising this product ...well, everyone has the right for an opinion..you judge- that is all I can say.Makita should have had a recall on this item because if you search the web you will learn that I am not the only one reporting these issues...."
2,Would not buy another one.............,"While not used in a contractor setting, used pretty much daily building decks and such. After two years the transmission/clutch went out. Makita wouldn't warranty as I could not find the original invoice, only the credit card statement from Mastercard. The quality is just not there and with other better alternatives would not buy Makita again."
5,Sense of Humor needed to read this book,Don't read this book if you don't have a sense of humor. Angry left wingers who read the book will feel like writing reviews that are actually longer than the book itself. I found the book to be quite funny!
5,Very Sharp,"Bought these as a gift and they are very sharp, well balanced knives. Excellent and a must have for the aficionado Chef. You will not regret adding these to your kitchen."
3,disappointed in the ending--,"I loved this book, the art, the rhyme, the thoughtful details...until the end.. the book makes it sound like the miracle of Easter is a rolled-away stone. ( while that is a symbol of Christ's resurrection, that is not the most important part...) and the books also states that Jesus' miracle was that He went straight to Heaven. It makes it sound like Jesus died and went to heaven and for some reason a stone was rolled away, instead of the true power of the resurrection. I know this is an alphabet book for children but I think it's important to get Christianity's most important story correctly told."
5,A well written book unlike other Cuban exile books,This book does a great job of weaving the story of Mirta Ojito and her family with events in Cuba as they unfolded in the years before after the 1979-80 Mariel boat lift. Mirta Ojito is a gifted writer. She manages to find humor in the many absurdities of what still constitutes life in communist Cuba.
5,Tons of Laughter,"In this set of five George and Martha stories, Marshall weaves two incidents into the book: George's love of sweets and Martha's photo-booth photo. He does this in such a deft way that at first you don't see it coming and then, when you see it, you're delighted at how one story ties into another. These masterful stories deal with hurt feelings and friends helping one another. I love how, when Martha tries to talk to George about his craving for sweets, he keeps repeating, ""Let's not discuss it,"" and then she turns the tables on George by using the phrase herself. A wonderful addition to a wonderful series."
3,soso,I didn't really like it so I stop less then half way through . So I would skip this one and save your time for something else . But at least the title is funny .
2,Very disappointed,"I bought this camera based on reviews on this site. I was buying it to replace a Cannon Powershot camera that my youngest daughter had dropped and broken.I have to say that I am extremely disappointed with this camera. It is hard to get a clear picture without the flash on and who wants to use flash outside? It is also slow, eats through batteries and is not user-friendly.I don't know what camera I'm getting next, but after owning this one for only 6 months I DO know that I'm going to put it on an auction site and use the money to put towards a new one!"
4,"Good price, good addition to train set",We have a large wooden train track that was in need of a tunnel that would accommodate all our various size trains. It fits well over the Brio-type track and can be shortened and lengthened and go around curves. It has been fairly durable in my household with 2 small boys.
3,Does it work or not?,I read that it was beneficial for prostate cancer. In vetro and without it showed it killed and stopped the cancer from spreading.It's one of the countless things u read on the internet. The vast majority are bull.However if u have cancer you'll try anything.We are all victims of false advertising and right now I fall for all of it.It's disgraceful that we are such victims.
3,Ginger Root,I received the product timely and it was exactly what I expected from the ad. Unfortunately it did not relieve my morning sickness though and even seemed to make my acid reflux worse.
5,Natra is Good to Me,NatraTaste is a very good sugar for me while Splenda and Equal cripple my muscles which makes them hard to get up of the bed in the morning. I don't have that problem with NatraTaste which is supposed to be the same kind of sugar.
5,No tears and no complaints,Worked great for taking out 4 metal staples on child's head. Kid didn't even feel it. Shipping was super fast. No waiting room. No arrogant doctors. No extra bills. I sang a danced afterward and we all had a good Christmas.
3,Not great for a nervous dog,"My dog jumped through a window that she thought was open and ended up with 20 staples in her leg. The emergency vet bill was $750 so I thought I'd save some money by removing the staples myself. The staple remover worked perfectly on a few staples, but others were tight against the skin and the dog objected when I tried to work the remover under the staple, despite being sedated with 2mg Xanax (the dog, not me). I removed the rest of the staples by cutting them in half with a pair of small diagonal wire cutters and rotating the staple halves out of the skin with a pair of hemostats. Worked fine, with little resistance from the dog."
2,Disappointing,"I had hoped to have more emphasis on bones than I got; it was almost an afterthought on the DVD. The bodhran part was also not very effective in communicating how to play, or exercises to help you become a better player. I would have preferred less ""demonstration"" of him playing with a group, and more instruction"
2,I love Canon and this is junk,"I previously had a canon s750 inkjet printer and then bought this several years ago. Not only is unbelievably slow, but it has two major problems: constantly misfeeds paper and SUCKS up lots of ink. It has a ridiculous number of cartridges (6) and is constantly using up too much ink. I loved my s750, but I'm skipping this company next time. Probably will go with an all in one lexmark, which presumably has better ink costs."
5,Canon Quality and Quiet as can be!,"I have had this now for a month. I have had every brand of printer there is but Canon beats them all. This printer is built solid as a rock evident by it's heavy weight. It has the six seperate ink cartridges which is great because you only replace the one that's empty, and the cartridges are very inexpensive. This printer also happens to be a very quiet printer to say the least. The built in card reader is great, and the LCD Screen, though it's a bit small, is nice, and allows you to print pictures without turning on your PC. If you want a great printer, take a look at this one, as it does everything great!"
3,Canon 6000D capability,"I have found the Canon to be very slow in comparison to other printers. Also, the showing of its ink statusis very vague and does not show the actual level remaining.The pop up window viewer is so dark you can hardly see what you are viewing. Over all, I believe that the printer has been designed for family photosrather than the professional graphics trade. Quality of the prints are very good and I do like the duplexprinting option, but here again, it is too slow to really get any use from it.Larry V childs"
1,Poor picture quality,"I am amazed that the other reviewers laud the picture quality. I have a 6 year old RCA which I considered to be a poor tv (weighed over 200 pounds), but the screen on that shows no pixelation and more realistic color. There is NO comparison in picture quality and this one cost $300 more that that did. I was really shocked at how bad the picture is; it's actually annoying. Plasma supposedly gets worse over time. I can't wait.When something moves onscreen you get a shadow, the TV takes a while to start, the screen jumps to adjust whenever you change channels, channel changing is slow. Really, this is the worst TV I have had since the 1960's. If you do not HAVE to hang your TV on a wall, do not buy this TV. Frankly, there are ones with better pictures than this. But don't buy a flat screen unless you need to. The quality is MUCH better on non flat models. At this point, cool technology loses out to plain decent functionality. My best TV is the RCA -- sad to say."
3,Good characters & story,"I really liked the characters in this story - they seemed very realistic and I found myself interested in what they were going to do. The basic plot was good as well, but the end was something of a let-down. There really wasn't a payoff in terms of finding out what the ""evil"" really was - some sort of nuclear mutant fish or what. I really would have liked a sequel - I didn't like the author's ""Retribution"" as much as this one."
5,Childhood Memories,"When I was younger my older brother bought this album. It brings back so many memories, and I remember that it was a great album. It's one of those albums that I can listen to the entire thing without skipping a track. I really wish that they would bring this album back, but I'm glad that they have the downloadable version too! Brings back many childhood memories, like watching my brothers try to break dance in our living room LOL. His best album ever!"
3,"Good intro to music recording, but nothing extraordinary","I'm in the middle of reading this book for an audio production course. It was the assigned text, and while it's not as expensive as many textbooks these days, it's also not a very well produced book. There are no photos, only illustrations that look like they were done on an Apple IIci. The writing is clear, though they repeat information about several topics. My biggest complaint is that it focuses on music recording, while I'm interested in other genres of audio. The authors don't ever acknowledge that you would want to recording something besides music. If you want to learn about music recording and want a very practical approach, this book is a good introduction. But I wish it considered theoretical questions beyond the merely practical."
3,Holes in the Bottom!,"I think this is a great idea. BUT, for a home with pests, it is horrible. We bought this thinking we could keep our bread safe from invading pests because NO WHERE IN THE AD does it state that there are 5 holes in the bottom. Upon arrival, there they were. What is the point in having a container that is open? We had to put duct tape on the bottom to seal the container. It is pretty narrow, as well. Even the cheapest of bread barely fits into there. Get the bigger size. I guess it has holes in it too!"
5,Bread Dispenser by Carol Wright,"My wife and I looked through bread dispensers available some time ago to see if she could find one that looked as if it might keep her white bread fresh without having to keep it in the refrigerator and she had me order one of these. After using it since then, she liked it so well she made me order a second one for her to keep my whole wheat bread in. I guess you can't get much better positive feedback than that!"
4,"Good delivery, good movie.",I'd already seen the Rob Zombie Halloween movie when I had ordered it off of Amazon and when it arrived I was very pleased. There was nothing wrong with the dvd itself or it's packaging and the movie was as excellent as I'd remembered.
1,BEWARE,This is NOT the Halloween movie you think it is. Looking at the picture you'd think it was the correct movie. IT IS NOT. Never watched. Only giving one star because I have to...otherwise ZERO.
5,awesome,"I am a new customer to amazon.com, and so far am very satisfied. This dvd was the first item I received, and I can't believe how good the price was and the dvd worked perfectly. The DVD came in just a skinny cd jewel case, but I don't mind. The movie was what I really wanted, and I could not be happier with the price or the speed at which the dvd shipped. I received it in just a week. Pretty awesome. Thanks amazon."
3,Remake of Halloween,"Nice graphics and filming. The storyline with Michael Myers is too involved. It strays away from the original Halloween where viewers know little about the boy. Like Alfred Hitchcock proved, horror movies are scarier when much is left to the imagination rather than showing it all on the camera."
1,Halloween Goes To The Trailer Park,"ThunderTrash 2008!! The Halloween series just gets worse with each film. I thought young Michael was played by a really ugly, young Jodie Foster looking kid. Was that a boy? I'm still not sure. Zombie puts the great Halloween classic movie through a white trash, trailer park dumpster. And why did every reject in this movie have long hair? Was that a requirement to get the role? Even Dr. Loomis had it early on. What a joke. Can you imagine Donald Pleasance looking like a filthy hippie? Very stupid. The only good thing about this unrated film is all the hot chicks. [...] Still, this was a horrible movie. Halloween, Halloween II, Halloween IV, V and even VI (Pleasance last) are classics in my book. All the others made a pure garbage. Don't waste a cent or more importantly your time of such crap!"
1,Totally should not have been made,"Halloween is my absolute favorite of horror movies- the first two anyway- so I wasnt too excited to hear about them not only making another one but it also being a remake of the original.And to be made by Rob Zombie which meant to me that it was going to be nothing but loads of swearing, nudity, and blood. I decided to give it the benefit of the doubt because just maybe it could be good and really dive inside the mind of Michael Myers. But sadly and horribly I was very wrong. It was exactly how i thought it would be. I thought there could have been hope with the whole background but no. To me it just seemed to be a waste of time for the film. I read someone else's review and highly agree with them...Rob Zombie should have just made Halloween 9."
2,Unable to live up to the original,"I am an avid Halloween fan and loved the origianl movies. So, when I heard that they were remaking this movie I was excited, but a little aprehensive as well. How can you live up to the origianl or make it better? This movie did reveal more about what makes Michael tick, but it also focused too much on the sex which not all horror movies need to revolve around. It would have been better to keep the focus on Michael and what drove him into madness and mayham."
1,REMAKE NOT NEEDED,"This is pure garbage next to the original Carpenter classic , the script sucks, the acting is horrible , if Rob Zombie wants to make a name for himself in film he needs to stop messing up classics and stick to creating his own films , the original will go down in history as being a timeless classic , this one will also go down in history for being 100% pure garbage and a waste of time."
3,Universal Stovetop 5-Turn Coil,[[.ASIN:B000FNJ5RG Universal Stovetop 5-Turn Coil]]. ordered 2 and both burners elements ordered were bent and broken loose on the outside element at the plug stabalizer. they were still operational.
4,Worked on our stove!,"Plugged in great, it was so amazing to have burners back when our old ones fell apart. It heats quickly & evenly."
1,What a waste,"The only people that will find this interesting are alumni of the Wharton program. But according to the author, they don't read anything but annual reports.I graduated with an economics degree from a top ten liberal arts college and with many of my peers got an investment banking job as an analyst. The Wharton students cheated themselves out of the opportunity of savoring their time to learn how to think, write and communicate at a top university. Their competitive antics were not admirable, just rather sad."
3,Good Documentary,Wish it was about the winning sailor. Overall a good documentary about people who challenge themselves to the ends of the earth.
4,Enjoyable true story - not over sensationalized,"I appreciate a documentary that illuminated the drama and excitement of the actual event rather than sensationalizing a story without enough details. This is a fascinating and actually quite sad story, but very interesting."
4,deadly ambition,"This documentary was effective and interesting. The family's participation definitely helps humanize Crowhurst (even though his decision to take on this task still seems incredibly irresponsible, foolish, selfish, etc.). It is somewhat difficult to understand how he was allowed/qualified to enter the race given his lack of experience, or, for the same reason, how he found a sponsor. This definitely falls under the category of ""cautionary tales about people who tried to do something dangerous they really shouldn't have been doing in the first place."""
3,Our children need solid facts,A 2006 non-fiction children's book about alien abductions need not be wishy washy. There are plenty of facts regarding abductions. This book leaves the child to draw conclusions about this subject. Left to my own childhood devices my young mind would have imagined so much I would have grown up without a wink of sleep. Lets not raise our kids believing in US governmental alien weather balloon advertising lights.
3,It's nice but not interesting,The CD was a bit disappointing as I heard allot of hype about it and found the music a bit uninteresting and the lyrics did not capture me. I just wasn't drawn into the mix and did not feel the dance track make me move.
3,An OK Read,"This one was better than the previous installment of the series, but by no means up to the first one.I found the whole story confusing. It was very hard to keep track of who was who, and some things that were thrown in as ""red herrings"" made absolutely no sense at all in the end. I hope the author can get back on track, because I really enjoyed the first book of this series, but I've been let down since."
3,Should have been better,"When the author sticks to discussing leadership, I found this book very readable and easy to understand. The book is written in a very easy to follow format and he explores the personal side of leadership. He presents some very altruistic ideas the sound very good, however, aren't always practical in the real world. This book would have received a higher rating for me also if Mr. Bennis would have refrained from all the political commentary throughout the beginning of his book. His repeated support for a former president while being less than flattering of the current president put too much of a political overtone in the beginning and really turned me off. It wouldn't matter if I agreed with Mr. Bennis or not, it simply didn't have a place in what would have otherwise been a very good book."
2,Wandering without focus,"I chose this book based on my reading of The Contrarian's Guide to Leadership by Steve Sample (a great book). Unfortunately, I could barely make it through this book. The few phrases of inspiration needed to be mined from pages of unorganized and misplaced vignettes about ""leaders"". Mr. Bennis begins with a sound set of leadership attributes, but loses focus along the way by adding more and more of what I would call ""bullet points of leadership"". I think he needs a good editor to help find a focus and stick with it. It is too bad, I think there is some good stuff in there. Good luck finding it."
5,Miracle's boys,"My book is about a boy named Charlie when he goes to Rahway. Rahway is almost like a jail for children. But when he comes home his brother tells him that their mom and father died. The father died because he tried to save a dog in the ice. So now Ty'ree, their older brother has to take care of them. Their little brother gets in trouble so he needs to go to Rahway. Then their great-aunt Cecile comes up to take them down South. But they don't want to go. I thought the book was exalent. I wouldn't change a thing besides the title. I would do that because the title has nothing to do with the book. so that is my book review."
5,Kudos Woodson!!,"This book is a wonderful book that should be on every school library book shelf! If you are a reading teacher or parent looking for a great young adult book, this is the one. The boys in this book are relatable and Ty'ree and Lafayette are wonderful role models for young boys all over the country."
1,Written for the purpose of maximizing market share,Some of the most strenuos exegesis of the scant evidence with regard to womens role in the first century church. If your a christian feminist attempting to justify clawing your way into the pulpit there may be some slight of hand material that you can use to bamboozle your opponent but an honest student of the bible will immediately be able to identify the schismatic text(s).
4,Comfort,"Bought this shoe because I like the classy style. This is about the 4th pair of this model I own. It is very comfortable, and not too bulky, which I appreciate because I wear size 11."
3,"ok, not a lot of support",I have an old ankle injury and this shoe is not supportive enuf to handle that problem. If you don't need support this shoe would be fine.
1,disproportionate fit,again too narrow in front ---wider at heel -- will not return to you as i send anything that does not work to someone in ethiopia
2,Not quality I expected,"I should have considered the reviewers who said to stay away from VIETNAM made shoes. I received the VN shoes and oh how horrible. Terrible hard foot bed, and no arch support. I have the ones made in Indonesia, so soft to wear and great foot bed. If I can find the Indonesia made ones I will rebuy, If not Good Bye Reebok. These from VN are IMO junk for wearing."
1,SYNTHETIC NOW???,WOW! I've worn these for many years. I can't believe that they are now made of plastic. I'll be looking for anything else.
4,Not as they used to bbe,"Others have said they can see a quality decline and I have to agree. I have always worn a size 8 Wide. But when I ordered them they were very narrow, could not even get my foot in them. I sent them back and ordered an 8 1/2 Wide. These fit but still don't look like a Wide to me. So if you are ordering wide think about going up a size. These have also gotten a lot lighter and the inside is not so padded as they used to be. So yes, I do think they have gotten more cheaply made but I still like them. And for anyone with foot trouble you would need a heel lift as these have no arch support at all."
3,Not the same Princess I used to buy,I've been wearing Reebok Princess style tennis shoes for over 30 years and I find they have lost quality in the last 10 years or so. They have become very light weight and they wear out quickly. The price keeps climbing though. But I still love the style. They have a minimal silhouette I find preferable to big soles and mutli colors.
5,Great Buy!,"Most confortable sport shoe I have ever been able to buy in a Size 12. Shoe runs a little narrow, so I would recommend Wide for a Medium width. Also, the price was the best I have seen for this item, especially for an extra large size (12)."
5,Nice looking and very comfortable,"I have had at least a dozen pairs of these Reebok Princess since I started wearing them about twelve years ago. Unlike most other sports shoes, these don't make your feet look like Bigfoot's, plus they are cute and VERY comfortable. I never get tired of these and I always have them both in black and in white."
4,Great for My Aerobics Classes,I attend low impact aerobic classes 4 days a week and these shoes worked great. I WOUld like a bit more arch support but can live with what's provided. Am considering ordering in White next.
1,Not leather,"Due to a medical issue, I discovered 18 years ago that these are the only shoes that are comfortable for me to wear. I have purchased a minimum of 6 pair a year, every year. I bought some last year on Amazon from Pelz shoes. They were just fine- just like they have been for 18 years. When I ordered new ones a few weeks ago, I did an Amazon search for ""Reebok Princess Leather"" and these popped up sold by Amazon. I ordered 2 pair. To my surprise they arrived and are synthetic not leather. Going back to the listing, I see that despite my search for leather, these shoes are now made of man made materials and are listed as synthetic. What a surprise. Apparently Reebok has decided to make only synthetic shoes. Not Amazon's fault, but maybe this product should not come up in a search for Leather Reebok princess shoes."
4,Working Reebok's,"I purchased the Reebok ladies tennis shoes to work in since I am on my feet long hours as a Breakfast Hostess and I find them very comfortable. However, I did buy an additional pair of inserts for more of a cushion flexibility. I am pleased with the shoes and would purchase them again sometime. Joan Fratantuono"
4,"OK Product, Ok price",I bought them as a gift for my wife and she said they were very comfortable and lightweight which is a plus when you're pregnant.
4,Comfortable but need a bit of stretching,"I purchased these shoes for a friend. These remarks are what she thinks of them: ""These are comfortable shoes, once stretched. I found then a bit tight, even though I take a size 10 medium, which is the size I ordered. Once they fit comfortably they are good shoes. Walking is comfortable, & I do lot's of walking. I would not hesitate to purchase them again, but maybe at that time I might choose a bit larger in size. I highly recommend them."
2,Slightly disappointed,"Turn around of ordering a receiving was good. Shoe overall was disappointing. Looks nice, but fit was uncomfortable in the width area. On my feet a lot and had to take shoe off because it began to hurt."
5,Great for Aerobics - from Amazon,I love these shoes because of the way the soles do not extend past the shoes. They are very comfortable and especially good for things like zumba where I trip over conventional athletic shoes.
4,mis-sized,"The quality of the sneakers was excellent, however they were incorrectly sized. Supposedly a size 8.5. Immediately upon opening the box it was obvious that they were not a size 8.5. They seemed to be more like a size 6.5. Disappointing because I had to pay shipping back to Amazon which negated the sale price plus I ordered a 9.5 replacement but it was sized correctly and was too large. This second order also had to be returned again costing me return postage. Overall a loss of almost $10!"
5,Love my Reeboks!,"I have been wearing this brand and style of shoe for about 15 years, and I keep coming back to it because it's just so comfortable. I highly recommend the Reebok Princess shoe for any woman who is active, because I walk, run, hike, and live in the shoe."
2,Reebok Princes Sneakers,"Women's Reebok, Princess wide width sneakersI have worn these sneakers for many years. I just bought a new pair, and learned they no longer are made of leather, but are made of manmade materials. I can't wear them for more than an hour or so. My feet burn and are painful. Very disappointed. I would not recommend."
4,nice shoes,"I purchase white shoes this model and i am happy with them, this ones i purchase were made our of real leather but then i purchase secende pair in another size from the same auction and when they come to me it turn out they were not out of real leather but synthetic - in auction was state that made from leather so those secend pair I returned and still wait for refund over 20 days."
5,Have used this for years!,This was my first book given to me as a voice student when I was 11 years old. I have since 26 years later both sung and taught out of this book regularly. I can't imagine my music library without it. These are great classical songs for any novice and continue to be a great reference as warm up arias for the more advanced singer.Check out:Vocalize!
3,"Great price, but otherwise overrated","I do recommend this as part of the serious singer's repertoire, and have asked several of my students to pick it up. it does contain some great songs. HOWEVER, a more well-rounded approach would be the ""First Book..."" series which contains several of these same songs, but it also includes repertoire in English, French, German, Spanish and a wide range of styles.It is essentially tradition that keeps this book in the essential repertoire category."
1,No like what I expected,"I thought this is a collection of Italian songs. But when I play the CD, I just heard piano solo, no vocal."
4,Solidly Built - RJ45 & RJ11!!,"Product seems well built and is easy to use. I like the fact that it covers surges thru either an ethernet connection OR a modem connection. A competitor's product does not do that , although it is less expensive. Surge protectors in general are hard to evaluate since you only know if they worked when you get a massive power surge. This one seems to be well built and carry's APC name which is recognized in the industry as a reliable name, although you can read complaints about anyone's products and they are no exception. I hope it works!"
5,This is it.,"For surge protectors for your laptop, look no further. Their $25K warranty/protection coverage should a surge get through to destroy your computer is amazing, and quite reliable. This alone should make the selling point here. But it is also compact, very effective, protects your laptop with voltage currents of Europe and the US, and offers line protection for any wired connections to your unit. Amazing, simple, and fantastic warranty. Oh, and if the thing ever fails due to a surge, call them up, and they will send a free replacement. I am on my second one, provided free...."
5,Great Gun!,This is a good gun it is light and very cool. It's also very accurite and shoots fast. I've not had any problems so far. I would recommend buying.
2,great gun,i was out shooting my gun with my buddy who has a tippmann 98 custom and this gun shoots just as fast and straight.The only difference is you dont pay 140$ for just a gun.this is a great gun i reccomend buying!!!
3,shades of gray?,"Sorry.. I can't see any shades of gray here. Yes, the cult were bad guys. Parks is great as an unhinged fundamentalist leading his flock of murderous homophobes.What is most disturbing though is that in the movie the government feels that even after Waco that it is alright to kill every man woman and child to cover up a blunder, or worse, just because they feel like it. There is nothing gray area about that. I really hope that there are no ATF agents like those portrayed and I really hope that the patriot act is not being, or can't be used like it is in the movie."
3,A little too realistic!,"Well acted with a well written story line, the entire movie is a bit too realistic based on today's news and hottest topics. Well worth a watch for sure. The hate crazed 'pastor' and his lunatic followers will make you both angry and concerned about just how far this type of activity may be spreading and how will law enforcement and society deal with it."
3,Red State Isn't Worth The Wait,"As a fan of Kevin Smith's I was looking forward to Red State. However, the film is a disappointment and I can not recommend it.What should be a simple story of a Waco-like siege on a group of religious extremists is borderline incoherent due to a number of tonal shifts.While the acting is sublime, particularly the performances by Michael Parks and John Goodman, they are wasted on such an uneven script. Other fine characters, like Stephen Root's conflicted police chief are introduced and then cast aside.Much has been made of funnyman Kevin Smith branching out and making a serious horror/thriller. While he succeeds in creating an arresting visual style, due to his direction and taut editing, he should have collaborated with another writer that understands the genre better."
4,"Ironic, Sometimes Funny, & Alltogether Creepy","This is one creepy movie, and yes, I understoodDogma [Blu-ray]. The general premise is that of a spoofish throwback to the Waco massacre, yet current affairs are intertwined with the Reverend Fred Phelps being used as the archetype for the film's bigotry-fueled, lava spewing preacher. Bible-brand, ritualistic killings of abducted teens instigates big brother to intervene, and the movie spirals downward into an ironic bloodbath that serves as a spiritual successor of sorts to Dogma. Kevin Smith is not afraid to experiment, and I enjoy his talent more as a serious filmmaker than cult comedian. The Rapture sequence was the cherry on top of the cake."
1,This will teach me to be impulsive,"I'm not against films that have allot of blood. My library includes 'Last of the Mohicans', 'Centurion', 'Saving Private Ryan', etc. But this flick reminded me of ""The Devils Rejects"". Just plain old pointless violence. Shooting everyone so the government won't have to explain anything? Farfetched at the least. The two kids getting getting killed about 3/4 of the way into this mess just sealed it. Waste of electrons bad film.I'm usually not so impulsive. Maybe I was sleepy when I watched the trailer. Waste of $9.99 which I won't do again."
3,Dinosaur bursting at the seams,"My grandson absolutely adores this toy. After only two days of play, I had to sew together the seams around the mouth. Several months later, the seam under the forearm split open. Unlike other Melissa and Doug products I've purchased, the quality of craftsmanship fails to meet the high standards that I had come to expect from this brand."
5,My 5 year old nephew loves his M&D T-Rex !!!,"I have two girls so I am not as knowledgeable about boy stuff. But I knew my soon-to-be 5 year-old nephew loved dinosaurs. I also am a big fan of Melissa & Doug products so I purchased this for his birthday gift. It was a huge hit. I am officially the coolest Aunt for buying him this T-rex doll. He loved it so much that he took a bath with it (luckily, it stood outside the tub). It measures 36"" high so to a small child, it is almost life-like. He and his brothers love to wrestle with it and drag it around and it has maintained its shape. I would expect nothing less from a M&D product. So, if you know someone who loves dinosaurs, I would highly recommend this stuffed toy."
1,A better title for this book: GODZILLA vs SUPERMAN,"The monster in this book resembled a certain Japanese lizard just a little too much for me. And 'Thor' wasn't that great either. If you wanna read something like this, save your money and pick up a comic book. It's cheaper, and the story's a heckuva lot better."
5,18v Battery Pack,"I don't believe that you can have to many batteries and the two pack saves a little cash. These were not packaged together but I am sure they were new. They were packed very well and could taken some serious handling abuse, not a scratch on them.This way I didn't have to open those near impossible plastic packages. After a couple weeks they are fine and I am sure Makita is providing a superior product. I am done with the secondary battery suppliers. 2 bad experiences is enough."
1,dead battery in less than 2 years,bought the whole set of 7 tools from homedepot including two batteries. one of them died today and I am finding lots of similar complaints here. the charger won't charge and the lights are flashing between green and red light. very unhappy because this is supposed to be high quality tool and they are expensive. my usage is very moderate.
5,Great,We received exactly what we wanted. The batteries work great and they were alot cheaper to purchase here than what we could buy them locally.
4,An overall pretty good job,"all i have to say is these points:-DJ sammy chose the (right titles) even if they were a little old but i guess that's what you do when you do the biggest dance hits of the year.-He put them in the (right places)too.-He used some (wrong mixes)ie. rapture, gotta get thru this, family affair, murder on the dance floor mixes could have been better"
2,Very Dissappointed,"I am a full-time dj but only a casual MOS fan. The mixing on this CD is pathetic. If this was mixed live, then my train-crash mixing has better timing than his beat-mixing. It honestly sounds like Winamp did the mixing for this CD. Vocal overlaps and poor timing destroy some good songs. The thing is, the mixes they picked for the CD are second-rate. Definately NOT the mixes I would pick. Save your money and don't patronized this hack job of mixing and music selection."
3,Toddler rocking horse,"My 18 month old received this rocking horse for Christmas. It is just the right size for him, however, it does not rock smoothly. Also, when ordering, it does not state that adult assembly is required."
5,rocking horse hits top of chart,"Our little one LOVED this rocking horse and it was a big success for Christmas. My one disappointment is that it was listed on Dec 3rd at regular price $100 and was on sale for $69, but a 10 days later it was down to $39.I was sad that I had acted too hastily and should have waited for the last minute..."
3,It's a net,It's a typical small net. nothing special or spectacular about it. I would buy it again if I needed a new net.
1,High priced phone,"This phone is slick looking but not functional. There is no speaker phone, no redial and not the easiest to use. Definitely not worth the money spent on it."
5,Inheritors of the Storm By Victor Sondheim,"I consider this my favorite book. I enjoyed reading of thedepression days, the reason for Hobo's riding the rails and learning about the Sinclair family. I would loveto read the sequels. I haveheard Victor Sondheim is a pen name. Is there any wayto find his real name and ifhe is still with us? Betty Lou Laveen"
3,(...) reveiw for hush from Mrs. Henson's first hour class,"In this book there is a family and their dad is a police officer and this big thing happens and i am not going to say because it will ruin the surprise. So the dad has to testyfy in court and they end up having to go somewhere, but i will not tell that either. they hate their life were they had to move but it gets better and i am not going to say how. that pretty much summs it up without telling you the good parts.I thought this book was ok...but i think this because it did not really catch my attention. i am not really interested in what the theme is in this book.i thought it was kind-of dull. if you are interested in up-beat books you will not lik ethis book, if you like books about racism and family's going through hard times you might liek this book."
5,Great Story for Adolescents,"While reading this story, I began to reflect on adolescence in general and through this story anyone can re-live their childhood. This story is about the coming of age of a young girl, Toswiah Green later known as Evie Thomas. The story is very sincere and makes the reader empathize deeply with the young girl. Woodson skillfully crafts this novel to include many of the challenges that adolescents face such as racism and identity struggles. By presenting these topics in the story Woodon brings reality to the world of adolescence and makes the story very engaging. A must read for anyone between the ages of 12 and up."
2,Mediocre Fiction,"Jacquelyn Woodson disappoints in HUSH. The best part of the novel is the back cover: plot synopsis. The book does address the loss created for a family entering Witness Protection and herein the viewpoint of Evie/Toswiah definitely reveals that childlike perspective. Overall as a teacher who suggests books for students, this one paints Jehovah's Witnesses in a negative light, lacks suspense and action, and does little to redeem the parents at the story's end. This book had the opportunity to demonstrate how a family can heal from tragedy but missed this mark as well. So why read it? The 12-year-old's monologue and interpretation as narrator tells this story well."
1,It didn't work,"The unit was easy to put together but it didn't work. The return was really easy and Amazon was amazing with the fast credit back to my account, that part I loved."
1,"great light, very bad lamp",This lamp worked okay for about 18 months and then died. It is impossible to contact the Grandrich company. This is a very unreliable product from a company that ignores its customers--not a good idea to buy this lamp
2,"""Cross"" This One Off","OK..OK...we get it already...yeesh! A voyage on the QE2 is called a ""crossing"", not a cruise. This point is reduntantly mentioned on just about every page! Donald Bain, does anyone ever edit your books?Still muddling through this series. For such a popular TV show they really missed the ""boat"" with these tie-in novels. Most are mundane and average. Such a disappointment. They need some new authors on board this ship!"
1,Didn't receive the item!!!!!,"Although the fault is not Amazon's,the product which was ordered and paid for was never delivered to the designated recipient."
3,I expected more of this movie,"For months, all of my friends have been telling me what a great movie this is and how I must see it. Finally, I did. Unfortunately, I am not as nearly as excited about the film as I wanted to be. It has start studded cast (Kevin Spacey, Jeff Bridges, Ewan McGregor and George Clooney). Film feels just so looney at times that it took some effort on my behalf to be patient with it. I was hoping that it will get better as it went along, but I was wrong.Jeff Bridges is really funny in his role of a hippie soldier. But in some way it felt as a recast of his role in ""Big Lebowski"".On the bright side, there were some beautiful goats in this movie - if you are into goats."
3,not that good,the ordering process for this movie was fine. the movie was just not what i expected after seeing the trailers. interesting story line that did lead to further research on the subject. would not recommend as entertainment.
2,Really Expected More With This Cast,"I saw reviews from baby boomers and reviews from the younger generation who all loved it; maybe being stuck in the middle explains my dislike.I waited with much anticipation for the release ofThe Men Who Stare At Goats, but it was all for nothing.While the acting was okay, it just wasn't up to par as is expected for Jeff Bridges or George Clooney. However, it's difficult when the story line is, well, boring.I forced myself to watch over half of this movie before just giving up. And I love movies!But this one, sadly, just didn't cut for me."
2,THE MEN WHO STARE AT GOATS,"I HAVE TO ADMIT, I HAD HIGH EXPECTATIONS WHEN I PURCHASED THE DVD. BUT I AM AFRAID THAT I WAS DISAPPOINTED. I HAVE ALWAYS LIKED GEORGE CLOONEY, BUT THIS PERFORMANCE WAS BELOW HIS NORMAL STANDARD. I FOUND THE MOVIE SILLY. I'M EITHER MISSING SOME SUTLE MESSAGE OR IT WAS A TOTAL WASTE OF MY TIME. I AM HAVING A HARD TIME GIVING IT AWAY. DIANA E."
1,"If Only The Killed A Goat, This Would Have Had Something Going For It.","I do not wish any animal to suffer harm, but goats are tasty when they are dead and smell when they are alive. So a dead goat can have some thing going for it. A dead goat would also avoid the horrid fate of being included in this, the worst movie I have seen. This movie was so slow and not funny that any self-respecting goat would rather be a kabob then be in this. It was simply that bad. It was pointless and just rambled. In addition, the acting was among the worst I have seen from this collection of actors. Skip this movie and retain two hours of your life you could never get back if you watched this awful movie."
4,"A little out there, but thought-provoking","I didn't know anything about this movie going into it. I hadn't seen any preview or read anything about...the cast just really appealed to me. Not having any expectations is probably the best way to view it. As Amazon's synopsis will tell you, the movie centers around Ewan McGregor's schlub of a journalist stumbling onto a group of psi-ops ""Jedi"" who once worked for the government. The comedy ensues from his attempt to figure out whether these people truly believe what they're saying, or if he's been excluded from some really sick joke. Jeff Bridges is at his hippie best here, and Clooney gives a tongue in cheek performance as the one ""mind Jedi"" who really seems to take his beliefs off the deep end. McGregor is unfortunately relegated to being background filler, his comedic talents not being utilized by half. Don't kill yourself trying to wrap your mind around this movie the first time you see it...it's not nearly as meaningful as it tries to be."
1,Horrible movie,"One of the worst movies I ever watched. I was bored to tears, I kept thinking this movie has to get better but it never did. I would recommend anyone wanting to buy it to rent it first because you will be disappointed!"
4,I liked it.,"I really liked this movie. Most realistic movie about Special operations that I have seen in a while. It may seem far-fetched, but it's really not."
2,"Beware, misleading","Not stated here is that the ""Digital Copy"" for this movie does NOT work on a Mac, only on PC's. That cuts out a big chunk of the home market, especially as Mac owners are more likely to have portable media like iPods or iPads. Shame on Anchor Bay for making such a discriminatory decision. I will avoid their products in the future. This is not a rating of the film, just the Blu-ray package."
2,I want my 2 hours back!,"I never thought I'd dislike a movie as much as I disliked this one, and, in watching this movie, wish I had not wasted two hours of my life that I'll never get back. The cast is great, and the acting is fantastic; unfortunately, the wandering plot and unreality of some of the scenes left my analytical mind thirsty for something to hang onto. May I have my two hours back?"
3,"HIGH EXPECTATIONS BY THE MAKERS AND ACTORS, I SUSPECT","Based on a novel and partially true tales. The movie attempts to be zany in certain parts while also trying to deliver a message of the need for Jedis. Star Wars fans will love it when Ewan McGregor asks, ""What's a Jedi?"" The movie tries to take us on the hero's spiritual quest to enlightenment but this is really hard to pull off normally and then adding the zany element makes it even harder. There's an impressive cast in this picture that tells me it started with high expectations but the delivery was only somewhat good instead of very good, great or superlative. WHEN WATCHED: 08/31/2010; MY GRADE: B minus to B."
4,Ask Angela Lansbury,"""The Men Who Stare At Goats"" is an amusing and silly film with a great cast, but it's ultimately inconsequential. If you looking for just a fun movie about crazy people doing crazy things, then you might like this film. Granted, the plot is anything but mind-blowing, but the dialogue is pretty funny, and the actions relating to the Jedi soldiers are pretty amusing. The cast all does well with their roles and are mostly pretty funny. Ewan McGregor was probably the weakest, but he was also the narrator/straight man for much of the movie. Plus, there's goats falling down. Add to the fact that the film makes liberal use of the band Boston's ""More Than a Feeling,"" and can you really fault this movie?"
3,Needs more songs,"I like the music, but I did not realize that there were only 2 songs on each of 2 the discs in the set for a total of only 4 songs."
5,BAKA & TEST 4EVER!!!!!!!!,"Long story short, Baka & Test is far and away the funniest anime since Excel Saga. The characters are all charming and well written, the comedy is rapid fire and effective, and the entire thing is an adredaline rush of laughter, action, and heart. I first watched this with my collage's anime club, and I highly reccomend it."
2,"At best, a guilty pleasure. At worst...","I purchased this after reading all the positive reviews, but was disappointed by this show. Many of the characters seemed almost to be caricatures rather than having depth. Cliched jokes common to anime were often reused. The fanservice-laden humor was not really that enjoyable or what I was looking for. Many of the characters were more disturbing than funny -- do we really need another show with a character like Shouko and her behavior towards Yuuji as humor? I seriously considered quitting the show after the early episodes.That being said, I did finish the series, some parts were funny, and the last few episodes were better than the beginning. I'd give it a 2.5/5 if fractions were allowed, but as is, I can't recommend this show at all for an older audience or anyone looking for something innovative."
2,Poor design,"This is a neat book, but only two stars because of its design. 100 short chapters uncategorized and in no particular order, with no index. There is a table of contents, of course, but the chapters are in no order and the way the chapters are titled they are not easily scanned by the eye, especially across 4-5 pages of listings. It's fun to flip through the book at random for a short while, but it's impossible to refer back to something you found useful at a later date unless you want to turn page by page until you find it. This was really a preventable problem and it's a shame it had to made an otherwise great book frustrating."
1,Awful for Kindles. No navigation at all.,"No table of contents. No Alphabetical index. No navigation at all. To look up a word 'Zoning' , you need to press next page button 1,000 times or more. (I got a refund as soon as I addressed the issue to the customer service.) Hopefully they(McGraw Hill) fix the problem soon. This review only addresses the mechanic of the kindle edition, not the contents."
1,This is not a book but a presentation!,"Got a tip from friend to read Rosenberg's books. This is an annoying start, paying $5 for something that isn't a book. Immediately cooled down my enthusiasm for the kindle app. Buy one of his books instead."
5,Excellent Resource!,"This book has been so helpful to me as a mom, with two budding musicians. Mr. Goode's insights into ways to counteract the negatives that are so common to performers, are, in my opinion a goldmine of wealth. What a blessing to be able to overcome them now, before the negatives become ingrained in their psyches!"
1,No Solutions,"This book can be condensed into a single sentence: ""If you suffer from performance anxiety, you need therapy to overcome it."" Beyond this, it really offers no practical advice for coping with or managing stage fright.If you're looking for practical tools, I'd suggest the books by Don Greene or William Westney instead."
1,Hymn? Try funeral dirge,"As a fan of military sci-fi, I really looked forward to reading this book. Now, I wish I hadn't. The idea for the plot is great, but, oh my stars, the writing was awful! Too much excess dialogue that had nothing to do with character or plot development had me thinking maybe there was some word count quota that just had to be met. The story does not progress well at all, unless you keep a notepad handy to write down all the dates that begin each chapter & try to untangle the plot thread that jumps chronologically forward then backward, then day here, day there, suddenly, a year ahead, a day back, a year or two back, a day head from there....UUGGGHHHH! I kept waiting for the humor the blurbs on the back cover promised, alas, what was meant as humor was forced & by that time I was so lost on the timeline, I really didn't care. Awful, awful waste of time. If you want good military sci-fi try John Scalzi, Ian Douglas, or Joe Haldeman."
3,"John Ringo's ""A Hymn Before Battle""","John Ringo's ""A Hymn Before Battle"" is both well written in a classical sense and in the sense that it superbly carries the author's voice, lending his unique and witty sense of humor toward running like a vein of gold under the dialouge and plot. Voice, however, is practicly the only redeeming quality of the novel. This is not to say ""A Hymn Before Battle"" is a bad book; in fact the only negative comment I have is to point out that it is absolutly average. A military SF book, ""A Hymn Before Battle"" resurrects a plot that is still old hat. Pasifistic aliens are attacked by a new species, and require the ""warrior earthlings"" to assist them in winning the war. This has been done before, and although Ringo doesn't do it badly, the spark of originality that would have allowed this book to contribute something to the SF community and to be a more than just a worthwhile read is lacking. All in all a good, if formulaic, first novel from John Ringo."
1,Terrible,"Most uncomfortable helmet i have ever owned. 3 pathetic, little, ""padded"" strips is all that stand between your head and the hard interior. I cant imagine how this provides any protection. Visor broke off while i was adjusting the chin straps. Rear reflector? Not on mine."
1,DOWN WITH SKA,"most terrible example of a ska CD to date, i bought this peice of platic in disc form and after plaing it im my machine i though( this would be a good time to jkill myslf) JK it was a great Album Wrong with me is an all time fav. im sure people that like this kinda music got a sence of humor so live it up a little people & buy the album"
3,Just ok.,"The book is extremely informative, perhaps too much so. I guess I expected to see more step by step how to type pictures. I'm very much a picture person. The author is witty and makes you feel like you are a worthy person even though you are not a size 2, she makes you feel like it is ok to be a size 22 or larger, so from that aspect, I very much like the book. I hope I will be able to sit down one day and read the book from cover to cover. I'm sure it is chock full of useful tips and tricks of the trade."
2,Can't use it with drivers,"From the start, I was disappointed with this tip because it will not attach to the DeWalt drivers that use attachments with the notched end, forcing me to use it only on a standard drill. From a practical standpoint, it does not work that well, as it does not drive the screws in far enough."
4,Lively & fascinating whodunit,"Bestselling author Penny Varnavides is killed in a unique fashion, much like in her forthcoming novel. Her lover Meredith is suspected of the crime, so their friend Lindsay Gordon returns to Britain to clear Meredith. As Lindsay untangles the web of the British literary world, she alarms the killer who in turn targets her. In her fifth Gordon mystery, McDermid has crafted a marvelous and enchanting book that will keep readers guessing until the final dozen pages. McDermid's take on the literary world is a strong point to the story, as is her characterizations, all of which is why she is one of the best in the mystery field."
4,"Good product ,except","First this is a good product. they are dewalt dw2012 # 12 slotted bit tip, except it is only a 2 pack .amazon made good and sent me another 2 pack .no hasle or anything this is why it gets 4 stars instead of 5."
4,The Red Queen,"The Red Queen is a rather sedate telling of Margaret's story, reminiscent of Jean Plaidy's The Red Rose of Anjou. It's a sympathetic look at Margaret, though it doesn't gloss over her faults either. The writing is solid, as is the research.This novel could stand to be longer. In less than 300 pages, The Red Queen covers 40 years, and the period from 1460-71 seems to have been given rather short shrift. I would have especially liked to have seen more interaction between Margaret and her maturing son, between her and the Earl of Warwick, and between her and Anne Neville. It was nice, however, to see some familiar faces from the Wars of the Roses without the stereotypes that mar so many novels set during this period. For telling the story of a woman who's too often been reduced to a mere caricature, Perot deserves high marks."
1,Great Music...Terrible Recording,"Does anyone actually listen to this before they make it into CD's? This is the poorest quality band music I've ever heard! The EQ is moronic. The high end needs to be cut by at least 12 db's. The fidelity is lousy. Sounds like it was recorded with one microphone, and there is definately some clipping going on. How could Altissimo do this to this great music???"
3,Just okay...,Love the idea of this toy but the quality is just okay at best. The doorbells stopped working after a few days of regular play. The lock backs fall over all the time and I have to readjust them so the doors can close. Typical Melissa and Doug quality. The brand has such great ideas for toys but the products usually fall short and are cheap in both materials and workmanship. I don't expect this toy to last very long.
3,Cute toy but key won't fit!,"My kids love playing with keys so when I came across this toy, I thought it would be perfect! The main purpose of this toy is to unlock each door with its own special shaped key. However, the ""u"" shaped key does not fit whatsoever inside the lock.. making that door completely disfunctional. Out of the four doors, only three are useable. A little disappointed since that is the whole idea of this toy. Also, the battery compartment for the doorbell sounds is a little tricky to open. If you are going to design a keyhole with a ""matching"" key, shouldn't the toy be inspected to make sure the key fits first??"
2,Reaching...but missing...,"Unfortunately the author's attempt to connect the dots and fill in the gaps in other books falls short here. Particularly unbelievable is the ""allergy"" rationalle for a pivotal part of the story. No space-going society would allow a victim of life-threatening allergies to hold a critical position on a space ship...this totally disrupted my ""willing suspension of disbelief."
2,Weakest Darkover book,The beginning isn't bad but around the middle it just goes downhill. I can't recommend this Darkover novel
5,Fantastic DVD!,"Very up-to-date (made in 2011) yet has A LOT of the 1986 contest dunks of Spud Webb, and many others from previous years including Dr. J. from 1976 onward.Lots of dunks, nearly all showed in replay, and lots of good (current) interviews of the players.Well put-together production (the credits are massively long)--a VERY professionally done show-- with great music, too. Mostly in film, not (preferred) video, but the film is sharp.A+!"
5,AWESOME,Wife absolutely loved this watch.This is a great deal.Fast shipping also. You will not be disappointed.Looks great on her.Diamonds look great.
5,Very elegant!,This was the first time I bought a watch without looking at it in the store! I was extremely impressed with the watch (Good pricing too). Very elegant and the crystals just add to the beauty!
4,Larousse Concise Dictionary: Portuguses-English;English-Portuguese,"Am familiar with Larousse dictionaries having lived in Europe and consider them among the best. Even though this one says Portuguese Edition, it reflects the pronunciation of that spoken in Rio de Janeiro, which is what I desired. I am pleased with it."
4,Larousse Portugues-Ingles Dictionary,"A great dictionary for portugues-ingles translations. Currently using for an advanced Portuguese class for which this dictionary is essential. Was using Harper-Collins which was not sufficient; additionally, the binding in the Harper-Collins hard-cover dictionary was pitiful and pages started falling out after less than a month of use. This dictionary is definitely the better of the two. Rated at 4 stars because some of the translations are not completely correct (with Brazilian use)."
4,Introduction to Telecom Billing,This is a good book for anyone who needs a quick and succint introduction on the billing process in Telecom industry without getting into technical details. It is a easy read. Will save days of research on google.
3,It was just O K. I thoutght it was a complete movie for some reason. I never realized it was by series which takes a lot of,It was just O K. I thought it was complete movie for some reason. I never realized it was by series which takes a lot of time.
3,"Not great - again, you get what you pay for","This box is built cheap, the hinges didn't align the wood properly, the wood has chips and imperfections in it, and though I ordered ""maple"" it could very easily be mistaken for a dark oak. Backing and rear screws are cheap. I opted to get this after reading all of the negative feedback, and all negative so far has been correct. It does however, suit the purpose so far for a very cheap price."
3,Only as good as the songs let it be,"Pretty much everything everyone said here is true - this is a raw/unchained performance complete with Sammy's swagger and Satch's skillz with a pristine image on blu ray, the problem is more or less what hinders the cd, the songs just aren't very good. Not really even sure WHY you'd put out a concert disc when you only have ONE album out.. They could have at least tapped ONE song from each members old groups, and they do include a couple of non Foot tunes but they don't amount to much. Understand I am a RABID fan coincidentally of both Sammy and Satch and I can see they have a sort of odd couple chemistry but again it all comes down to the SONGS. Thankfully Satch has seen fit to give me his best work yet with Wormholes and I'll just have to wait for another Foot album to see if they can't craft songs with a bit more hook.. but as it stands this is a purchase I made with few regrets but also little replay value."
5,This album was never pushed by the label due to management changes,"Trace Adkins was not the golden boy of new management, so the album was never pushed and did not sell well. If you like Trace Adkins or real good country music, this album contains songs that should have been number ones. Not a bad song on the album."
3,Break out the service manual to bring this unit up to speed,"I like a lot of the features about this unit, but folks interested in a really good picture will want to lower the red push and fix the 16:9 oversqueeze problem. To do these, you'll need a service manual (not the users manual you received with the unit). Not sure how much they are, haven't bought mine yet. There's a few places on the web that talk about how to correct these two problems, but they are for the previous WEGAs not the FS100 and FS120.I have not heard the high-pitched whine, but I don't hear so well anyway. It's pretty heavy (my specs said just a few ounces shy of 100 pounds), but that doesn't matter to me, I don't lug it around from room to room ;)."
5,Awesome TV,"I've had this tv for ~5 years (back when the price was a hefty $600) -- The picture quality is crisp, and the options are quite nice. The tv does weigh a lot.I've grown to trust sony products since this tv fell on my ps2 and both still works w/out any defects.Since i paid at least $600 at the time it came out -- getting this for less than 300 is a bargain."
2,Not worth the money,"There was no return policy for this item, and, when we tried to unscrew one head, it stripped the plastic and is now useless. It had a lot of different types of sprays to choose from, which we liked, and it is a water saver, but it was a waste of money for us since we can't use it and can't return it."
2,Blasphemy!,"I enjoy good electronica as much as the next person, but listening to this album was a painful experience. What a way to ruin perfectly good songs! Besides, do we really need a different version of ""Fitter Happier""?Even if you are a die-hard Radiohead fan (which I am), you should stay away from this CD, especially if you didn't really care for Kid A (which I did). On second thought, you should stay away from this IF you're a Radiohead fan! Only tracks that are even remotely tolerable are Creep, Climbing the Wall and Fake Plastic Trees.Pretty please, with sugar on top, don't just buy this because they are Radiohead covers. Do yourself a favor and listen to the samples first. You'll thank me later."
1,One star is VERY generous - Garbage Mutations,"This CD is aurally repugnant. Each time I listen to it I dislike it more and more. I love Radiohead and I dig electronic music, so I figured this CD would be great. The idea has potential, electronic remixes of Radiohead's infinitely remixable music, but flops. Poorly done. Hard to listen to. Some of the synths sound like an 8-bit Nintendo system when it freezes up. Great soundtrack for a headache. I could go on and on. Please don't support the profanation of Radiohead with this audio ...!"
1,the music actually atrophies into itself,"I bought this used at a local independent record store. It ruins all of the musical brilliance that radiohead have created and crushes all of the god-given talent that Thom Yorke and his posse have shared with the world. No, it's not supposed to be radiohead, but it is a quick buck for the record companies. Dont dive into temptation."
1,Plastic Mutations: The Electronic Tribute to Radiohead,"ABSOLUTLY TERRIBLE! I beg you; do not support this atrocity with your hard-earned dollars. It really is awful. I was thoroughly depressed listening to it; I really was not aware that people could actually make a Radiohead song sound so bad. The synthesizers and mostly all the ""electronic"" inserts are ridiculously tasteless and obnoxious. The singers, they should not even be granted that title, are at times so off-key it's unbearable. So if you're looking for horrible renditions of Radioead's songs or just looking for a good old use for that aging airplane barf bag stuffed in the back of your car somewhere, this is a winner."
1,$35.40 - DO NOT BUY IT,I needed to replace a toddler size porcelain lamp in my bedroom and this plastic portable opposite is just the ticket. I don't know what a flourescent lamp has to do with sunlight. To me it is just a relief to have an easy to use lamp.It is not a dark grey but a typical office putty color.The bulb did not last long at all and costs too much to replace. I feel snookered and have decided to just discard this lamp and learn my lesson about buying lamps using normal bulbs.
4,Worth the $$$,"It's the exact same lamp as the Verilux, minus the reflective backing and the grating over the bulb. Well made lamp, and definitely worth the money."
4,Good for a student,"You pay cheap, so don't expect you are going to get an ikea type of lamp. But if the only thing you concern is its usage, then it is perfect."
1,Worked for 5 minutes - then nothing,"Just purchased this item for my office. Put it together, turned it on and was happy for 5 minutes. Then it just stopped working. Tried another light bulb from a lamp that was working and it still didn't work. Tried several different outlets, etc. Still nothing. I'm not happy that this only lasted 5 minutes. I'm sending it back and asking for a full refund."
1,D o Not Purchase This Dog!!!,I ordered the lamp and it arrived yesterday. It did or will not work. It blew out the Mercury Light Bulb. This morning I threw it in the garbage. Not worth even sending this piece of junk back or doing further business with Amazon if they promote such crap.
2,Lacked detailed info,"I ordered this book hoping to get detailed info on a number of airplanes. It listed specifications, exterior dimensions, weights and fuel capacities for many aircraft but lacked any real details on individual aircraft models. The Aviation Consumer Guides are better and have more detailed analysis of accidents and aircraft systems. I returned it."
4,Just the plane facts!,"I am new to general aviation and was looking for information about the different types of general aviation planes: what they look like, how they perform, and a ballpark estimate on how much they cost. (I'm not seriously planning to buy one (not yet anyway), but price is a useful piece of information). This book delivers all that.The book could be improved by providing a few more photographs and by including a few more pieces of data for each plane (e.g., cruising range, ceiling, fuel consumption, Vmc, etc.). Another improvement would be to increase the information in the narratives for each type of plane, better describing flying quirks and typical problems for the purchasers (e.g., expensive ADs, commonly found damage, etc.); detailed narratives like those contained in the dated ""Buying and owning your own airplane"" by J. E. Ellis would be a benefit. With these few improvements, the book would be perfect."
2,book with an identity crisis,"it's usually a good idea to clearly define your target audience, otherwise you might wind up writing a book that suffers from an identity crisis. this book is a good example of when this mistake happens.don't get me wrong: there's good information in this book. but going from chapter 1 to chapter 6 is a great leap in terms of focus, depth and material. i don't think it's reasonable to start from not knowing what communication theory is and trying to understand Decision-Feedback Equalization. this is a very difficult subject by itself, and trying to waive some theory into this context is not effective."
4,best bike rack ever!!!,"its perfect for long weekends away! easy to hook up, easy to take down. comes with everything you need to take off."
4,You need a calendar?,"If you need a calendar and like the OC, then this is for you. My only problem with it is that while there are individual pictures of Ben, Rachel, and Mischa, there are none of Adam Brody alone (one of him and Rachel together). This is a great mistake IMO since he is the one that most fans of the show would rather see (he really should have his own calendar actually). Because of that, 4 stars (but its really only a calendar, you can't expect much from it)."
2,Annoying,"This seemed like a good idea but I found the music here to be irritatingly contrite, especially the snappy harmonica. Just couldn't stomach more than 2 listens."
1,Not worth one star,"I bought my unit after reading all the reviews published here. Since the majority were favorable I was hopeful that the probability was good that I'd be satisfied.The unit displays an impressive amount of information. At first glance my only disappointment was that there was no temperature readout at the sensor location. Not a deal breaker.It performed flawlessly on a pork tenderloin; the remote receiver was able to maintain contact through an outside wall two rooms away from the sensor.The second time I used it the display defaulted to 199*F and sounded a constant alarm. Nothing, not removing/replacing the batteries, not synchronising the units, could restore normal functioning.Now, I'm left with my wife's reminding me that I should have bought locally so I could take it back."
1,BBQ Thermometer You Cannot Use on the BBQ,"This actually worked well in the oven inside the house. But the first time it went outside to the gas BBQ it broke. I did not have the probe in any flames, it was in the chicken and the lid was closed to minimize flare-ups. If they would have advertised this for indoor oven only use, I may have said a nice thing or two about it.I'm not sure if I will try to go through the hassle of trying to find another probe (don't know if they sell them), the hassle of returning the unit, or the hassle of kicking myself whenever I see it in my kitchen wondering why I did not pay more attention to the negative reviews.Do not buy."
1,waste of money,"I used this thermometer 3 times, the first 2 worked perfect. The 3rd time I went to use this device the monitor read 199 and was not getting a signal. I not spending five dollars on another worthless probe that I cleaned very carefully each time after each use not getting any water on probe connection. I will investigate the Maverick thermometer."
1,Don't touch this,"I cook a lot. I use thermometers to get things right. This is the least useful of them all. Then, when the probe broke, it couldn't be replace. OK, now what should you do? Well, look at ""Cooking Thermometers"" and get the one with the greatest range in temp. You will regret this product because it does not let you determine what the finish temp is. It just starts beeping at you. It thinks it knows ""WELL"" from ""MED."" It does not. Cooks know what they like. Internal temperature is important. This product is cute, but useless. BTW, I don't think you need a wireless model anyway. Something like the Polder Original is much more useful, and much cheaper."
1,Another One Bites the Dust,"I'm not sure why, but this is the third or fourth one of these I've bought - they all fail after about six months. This one did not last two months!"
1,same experience as many others here,"I love the idea of this product. But same as so many of the reivews here, mine worked for about 4 uses and then stopped."
2,Ultimately disappointing product,"I have been through 3 of these. Each time I get my hopes up that this time will be the winner, but it never fails to malfunction after a few months of use. Perhaps we barbecue too much. I have been careful to keep the thermometer probe from touching the hot grill, but nonetheless it inevitably fails. It's such a great idea for a product, but it doesn't seem to be able to stand the heat.Besides that, the other major frustration is the fact that both the probe and the remote reader need to be opened up each time in order to reset them for functioning together.Alas, I suppose I'll have to give something else a try."
1,piece of junk - zero stars,"what a piece of crap!Bought this for my wife for xmas.It worked the first time.2nd time, all the batteries are dead!!!Then, after replacing the batteries, it doesn't get the temp from the probe!Useless piece of junk!"
4,The light that is emitted is excellent!,"Very good product. It must have but so large, but its fucionabilidad is very good. The light that is emitted is excellent."
4,Six Sigma GB,"I think this book is an excellent resource for experienced Six Sima managers. However, if you want to buy this book as a study guide for the SSGB certification test, or as an introduction to Six Sigma, it isn't going to help you out much. I guess my lowered rating is due to the fact that the book didn't meet my expectations as it was described on the Amazon site."
4,"FRIGHTENING RAW, HONEST AND ACCURATE","I also suffer from bipolar disorder, as does Andy Behrman, the author of ""Electroboy: A Memoir of Mania."" Never have I read a more brutally honest account, albeit raw, of this illness that ravages millions of Americans (including both my brother and sister). I've read accounts of mental illness by Kay Refield Jamison and Elizabeth Wurtzel, but I've just never been this moved and frightening reminded of the intricacies of my illness.Although Behrman's account seems to highlight an extreme case of manic depression, I really felt like I was taken along for the roller coaster ride of my own life. I became caught up in the frenzy of his mania - - the shopping sprees, the promiscuity and the psychosis.Although ""Electroboy"" is technically a memoir, fellow sufferers of the illness (or any other mental illness) will learn quite a bit from this account (as will mental health professionals). It's a must read - - highly informative, captivating and entertaining."
3,Not too bad,You get what you pay for. The original ones are very expensive therefore these are cheeper and need some adjustment to fit.
3,Ok inexpensive replacement,"Had a little stove-top ""incident"" that required a coil replacement. Not as high in quality as the original coils on my stove, but works just fine. A little concerned about how long it will last, will update in a few months."
5,Range Kleen 7361 Replacement Plug-in Range Element,"This item would likely fit any stove as long as it's 8"" in diameter. I saved over 65% from buying this on this site instead of going to my local Lowe's. I have a Kenmore Elite stove and not sure of model but the extra one I ordered also fit a Whirlpool Stove."
3,Will Not Fit Some Tappan Ranges,"I will give this four stars for being an amazing bargain. However, it will not fit my range. I have a vintage '60s Tappan Fabulous 400, and the wire loops on mine look nearly identical to those shown in the picture. The measurements are perfect, but the size of the wire loops on these are too large to fit the plug-ins on my range. The wire loops on my existing burners are much tighter and a bit smaller. Too bad. Last time I replaced a burner, I had to go to a local appliance repair store in a major city and it cost me about $35 to get one. So, the cost savings are substantial if this one will fit your range. I would recommend doing some research before buying a burner replacement to make sure. The one I got in the mail was shipped very quickly and it looks very sturdy, it's just too bad it won't work on mine. It looks like an excellent product if it will fit your range."
2,"Should have been called ""Best of John Deere""","Very irritating that they used clips from prior John Deere DVDs to make this one and advertise it as ""special edition"". ""Repeat Edition"" would have been more appropriate. The action is slower than expected as well. Does not keep my sons attention like prior John Deere DVDs - possibly because he's seen it already."
5,damn...,"i was never aware that it was possible to create music with this much emotion without playing most of the instruments. i am just listening to this for the first time, and i am blown away"
5,Sonic Alchemy,"This record is a perfect example of how a sampler can be used as a instrument to make a album. Midnight In A Perfect world is my favorite track on this album and is probably one of the 25 best songs written or composed in the 20th century. If you see this record missing from someone's collection or know someone who hasn't listened to it , you need to step up and turn them on to it."
5,Best Damn Album I Own,"Found this album by cruising through a record store and this was the overhead album playing. Bought the album right there and have enjoyed many repeated listenings since. A full spectrum of sound that lulls you into his trance. Great to listen to at work, before sleeping or just plain chilling out. Using music samples, scratching, and even some movie samples (Prince of Darkness), this man pieces together sounds and makes one haunting album. Defies any musical catagory, but do yourself a favor and pick this up."
3,Entroducing Vinyl Review,"Just want to say that I love this album to death and there isn't one thing I would change about the album, but the vinyl edition doesn't include the track What Does Your Soul Look Like (Part 4). It's one of my favorites on the album, but other than that the record sounds great, and unfortunately it is not gate-fold packaging."
4,"Great overview, but lacks some depth in places","This book was used as the text for a Construction Law case I took in law school. Overall I found the book to be very good. It was clear, concise, well written, and easy to understand. It also brought a pretty wide range of topics into the mix, and provided a fair amount of places to go for additional information (by way of case law). If I had to complain, and for the purposes of this review I will, I would make two comments: 1) There are areas where a little more depth would be nice. Frankly, I don't think the scope of this book really includes in-depth analysis on anything so this might be a non-issue for many folks. I just found that there were a few times (a very few) when I was looking for more information. 2. This book does a really nice job incorporating definitions for new terms into the text. However, there are a LOT of new terms and a glossary would have beeen a nice addition to the text."
5,"Five stars, but doesn't do these guys justice","I love Golden Bear. Let that be said first and foremost, but this album does not do them justice. Seeing them live is the ONLY way to truly experience the Bear.Pumping your fist with Grizzle to the lyrics of ""Ten Thousand Orchestras,"" dancing around like a mad man with all the loyal local Austin fans, and getting to be RIGHT next to the band as they play your favorite songs off the album and others you haven't heard.This album is awesome, only a couple of songs do I skip and only then because they're a little too slow for me (Silent Prayer, Lady Soul, and sometimes The Darkest of Days). The rest of the album is perfect for my tastes.Standout songs: Ten Thousand Orchestras, A Reason To Be Proud, Golden Bear Revival Stomp, Victory is Ours but not necessarily in that order."
5,FTA Receiver View Sat Ultra,"This unit is great to see satellite broadcasts from anywhere! I was skeptical of the product, but the unit is updatable via the front USB port by using a thumb drive with no rebooting or anything! Updates are usually availble free every week or two at a time as the codes change forhte unit to function. I have three dishes attached to mine and have had no issues at all. The unit is very simple to setup and program! Up an running in around 30 minutes! No need to pay the satellite companies so much money to receive your signals for you.. do it yourself and save that money! This is a no-brainer, and easy to setup. Makes a great hobby too!"
4,Writing Companion,"I have purchased two separate Franklin Bookman Dictionary Thesaurus & Game electronics over the last 7 years and have been most pleased. The amount of writing I do enables me to be sufficiently supported by means of this electronic device. I have found it to be more current in dictionary/thesaurus word capabilities than Microsoft software offers and quite honestly, it goes everywhere I do... What I am currently seeking to find out though, is whether or not there is a yearly or bi-yearly software update with respect to the 2002 version. If this can be answered please acknowledge..."
3,Not as good as the MWD-1470.,"This product is not as good as the MWD-1470 (which i also reviewed) for one reason:The touch screen.You touch it, get fingerprints all over it, try to clean it, push all the touch buttons, mess it up.Get the MWD-1470.Last Word:This is a ""B."""
2,very disappointing,"there are many bad points about this electronic dictionary.a) the thesaurus is terrible. when you search a word, it only gives you about 4 or 5 synonyms.b) the dictionary is also very poor. the definitions are not very easy to understand, sometimes it gives a rather stupid answer. for example, lets say you didn't know what the word 'indignation' meant. you type in the word, and the definition will say something like 'to be indignant'. hiw are you meant to learn anyting from that??at one point i got so fed up with this piece of junk i resorted to the trusty book-form dictionary. buy a book version instead; this thing isn't worth half it's price."
4,Adobe Photoshop Elements 4.0 - reference book,"It is a good reference book, but would not advice it for a teaching manual. Since everything is listed in alphabetical order, it really can not be used for your main educational tool in learning how to use the software."
4,Excellent math review for nursing practice,This was a nice review of math skills needed in the nursing field. There were good visual aids in the book and steps were very systematic.
1,Do not buy it,"One star for warmth. Feathers coming out of the fabric, not loop to hang the jacket up. I did not return it, also, I have never worn it. Waste of money."
2,bit holder,this bit lost it's ability to hold bits way to soon after purchase. I do not recommend it.
3,too fragrant,I was hoping for a soft scent. This is really STRONG! You can use it as a room deodorizer while still wrapped! This brand is terrific soap though and I love the mild honeysuckle one!
1,Measures too warm,"This thermometer definitely measures a few degrees too warm. I only tested the indoor part of thermometer, not the outdoor."
4,Great Thermometers,I purchased 3 of these thermometers to get a more accurate reading than the old conventional thermometers. These proved to work great and also keep good time too. For the price and ease of set up this is the thermometer to purchase.
5,Wow!,"I purchased 2 of thermometers, one for my son-in-law and one for my husband. Can't review the one sent to Maryland but the one at use here in my home is great. I truly never cared about the indoor/outdoor temperature until my husband set ours up and now we both find ourselves checking it each time we pass it. Great fun!"
3,Misleading,"Product works fine and is accurate enough for my needs.I was disappointed that the product description is wrong.1)This thermometer actually uses AAA and NOT AA batteries. (I didn't have AAA batteries until receiving this product).2)The backlight is an unattractive green and NOT blue as pictured.I would recommend this product only because it's cheap, but I wish the product description was accurate and updated."
2,Functions well but could use some design updates,"Easy to setup and temperature and times look accurate.But the LCD screen is a little cheap and you can see lines in it. And almost any amount of pressure will cause the screen to show more of those lines. Also I was a little disappointed in how the probe was attached. It just comes straight out the side and is hardwired. I mounted it on the wall tried to tuck as much of the wiring behind the wall, but you can see a little of it stick out from the bend on the side.It's the best I could find though because it doesn't seem like a big market for these with the wired probe and the choices are few."
4,"Great item, but received an open one","When I received this ""new"" item I purchased, the plastic case was already cut open. I did put the batteries in to see how it worked, and it seemed to work very well. However, I felt ripped off that I paid full price for an item that was obviously returned, and since it could have been returned to being faulty I returned it to Amazon. Hopefully no one else got my return. It looked like it was a good item, but it oddly would give different readings for inside and outside even though I had the probe right next to the main unit, so I took off one star. But for the price, it's worth it as long as you get a new item, since that's what you're paying for."
3,It's good but not the same as in the picture,"The back-light is what I have a problem with, the posted here picture is misleading.The back-light is 3 tiny green leds that only can be seen in darkness and the picture shows blue back-light.I taught the back-light would be on all the time but only comes on with the press of a button.Other than that it's a good clock & thermometer, it works really well, I have the probe stuck to the wall outside the window of my living room & I can say it gives an acurate reading.I recommend this & I am going to buy another one for my room."
2,Quit working about day 33/34. Work well until it stopped working.,"This quit working after the 30 day limit. My son tried to fix it and could not. We ended up throwing it out, because it was of no use after it stopped working."
5,Just What I Wanted,"This purchase was to replace a Radio Shack digital thermometer I bought in the late 80's. The outdoor sensor is on a very long cable so I had my choice as to where to place the base unit. My old Shack one would only display one temperature at a time, so having indoor and outdoor display at the same time is a luxury. This thing has many more functions than I need or have even tried. I was guided by the other reviews for the thermometers I looked at, and the reviews (as well as the brand) made me choose this one. I made the correct purchase.I have the outdoor probe in the shade on my balcony, so I now know what the temperature is on the terrace."
2,Simplistic and Implausible,"A middle-pschooler might enjoy this book; I finished it only because it was the only reading material available on a flight. Ridiculously, the protagonist noses her way into the lives of countless people she considers suspects, based on curiosity. Alarmingly, she twice leaves her three-year-old in the care of a chief suspect. Seemingly, she spends no time maintaining her household, yet her husband encourages her involvement to the point of absurdity. I adore cozy mysteries, but this one offended my intelligence."
3,Anonymous,"I , too have loved this day planner over the past 2 years. I love the pictures and information provided in between the pages of a calendar/ date book. The 2004 edition seemed to have some problems that are of concern. Throughout the book there are small errors and one large one and this leads one to wonder about the credibility of other information in the book. Especially when many of us do not have time or the skills to check the accuracy of such information (that is why we turn to a calendar of this type).The price , too, increases with each year and a local store stopped carrying it because of the cost. The cost impedes a sale.Most of the artwork is amazing and of excellent quality for a product of this calibur, but there are also pieces interspersed that appear to be of low quality and take away from the value of the overall product.I do enjoy this date book , but the little things may not make me a repeat customer."
2,Too overwhelming!,"I got this book in hopes to help me sort through my overwhelming tasks of being a mother of four, wife, and homemaker. After getting through the first few chapters I am more overwhelmed than when I started. I feel like it is full of lists of ADDITIONAL things I must do. I was just hoping for some more motivation/inspiration, and I feel like it's just a big compilation of to-do lists. To the books credit, maybe it gets better, I did only get through the first couple of chapters."
4,Great Way to Learn Spanish Words,We got this early so that we could start to learn Spanish before our son. The expressions help you use the words that you are learning.
4,Not too bad at all.,"Evil Star is a fairly solid album. There are only a couple of drawbacks on the album. Most noticealby is the singing. At first it might not bother you but, eventualy the extremely high pitched vocals will give you a headache. The other notable thing is that the songs are all pretty long, three songs top six minutes.The best song on the album would have to be Black Wing Rider but, Die By The Sword is a close second.Overall I suppose this album is a good buy although you should keep in mind my ramblings about the vocals."
3,Not exactly,"I was expecting this to be impact ready. It wasn't, but it still is a very good bit. They will grind down a little to easily."
5,It changed my life,"I've used this GREAT book before my last trip to the USA. It's amazing the difference it made to my english. I had several business meetings with Americans and I understood everything, I mean everything they said. That didn't happen to me before using ""Waddaya say?"". I also learned to use reduced forms to improve my speed. But the most important thing is the almost magical change in my understanding. A suggestion is to follow carefully the instructions, then listen each conversation an repeat it many times. The book is also great source of expressions and uses, not just reduced forms. A must have ! Thank you Nina !!!!!"
5,Take this trip to hell,"Valhalla Rising is beautifully shot, the acting is crazy good, and the sound and score are amazing.This is not your conventional movie - so if you're looking for a mindless action flick - look elsewhere. This feels more like a painting or a poem - check it out if you're sick of the formulaic stuff coming out of Hollywood."
1,Awful Movie,"I have no problems with the seller of this DVD, but the movie and the plot were awful. It really was a waste of time and money, but maybe someone who likes bad endings and barbaric killing with no purpose will enjoy this movie. Sorry, but this is just my opinion. I did like the scenery in the movie though, but that was it. It really deserved a zero."
5,Great Movie,Despite the scarce dialog this is a great movie that displays mans breaking points when in a mystical and unknown land.
1,"Same problem, didn't fit!",Didn't line up for mounting hole on 98 Accord V6. Shame on Bosch! Poor quality part that was way off and they need to address this issue!
4,No Ordinary Love,"A DEEPER LOVE is the story of unconditional love and acceptance. Taking place in Atlanta, Georgia, it is the story of Angela, a young Black lesbian woman, who finds herself alone on Christmas Eve. Recovering from a break-up, Angela ventures to a lesbian bar where she encounters Paula. Angela is comfortable with her sexuality, whereas Paula is still in the closet. The taunting of her mother also caused Paula's issue with her skin color and she comes to realize that black is beautiful.A DEEPER LOVE is the well-written story of Angela and Paula's quest for a love that surpasses skin color, family, and sexuality. Shonia Brown has authored a compelling love story and has given the literary world insight to lesbian love.Reviewed by Robilyn HeathThe RAWSISTAZ Reviewers"
1,Anti-Fog??? Please be honest...,"I purchased this product to put on my helmet visor. It was printed on the bottle for ""helmet visor"" but it DOES NOT work at all. I don't see any difference before and after I used this so called anti-fog spray to my helmet visor. I then tried it on my bathroom mirror, don't see the difference as I clean my mirror with water, fog still there after a hot shower. Don't waste your money. Kleer Vu ""Anti-fog""... not really!!!!"
4,Pyle 8 Inch Ceiling Speakers,"For less than $50, these are an outstanding deal - cheaper than what I could have bought at Home Depot/Lowes. Wanted a set of white inexpensive ceiling speakers for the formal dining room - wife holds occassional card games and other women group functions in there and wanted some background music. These Pyle speakers were perfect: inexpensive, sounds good (though it does lack bass - but hey when you get a gaggle of women playing cards they don't care or appreciate the fact that the bass level is lacking). Very easy to install (it takes more time to run the speaker wiring up in the attic than to install the speakers). Make sure you have a wall board hand saw, a good stud finder (make sure there are no studs located on the other side of the ceiling where you want to install the speakers), and a Shop Vac (for the clean up). I would definitely buy these again and would recommend them."
3,adequate,for the money they work just fine. we use them for our bedroom and are just fine. nice looking too.
3,"Great price, good quality","This is a nice set of speakers, for a decent price, this is the second set we bougth because the first set after a loud nice of music got burned"
4,"Good Book, but requires a supplement","Liboff goes into much more detail in his explanations than do many other undergraduate texts on quantum mechanics. Unfortunately, it is often necessary to look at another book before you begin trying to decifer this one. In my undergraduate quantum course I often read Griffiths first to give me a basic idea of what it was I needed to understand, and then I would follow through with Liboff in order to actually understand it. This book was definitely helpful with a first course in Quantum Mechanics."
5,"return to Tarawa, The Leon Cooper Story",This is an excellent documentary of what is arguably the most violent battle of the Pacific War. Ed Harris does a fine job narrating the story.
3,"Nice book, but limited information for an ""encyclopedia""","Great seller, good price, but this books title misleads the consumer. It seems to have more of the unique items in milk glass, than the regular stuff."
4,milk glass,I love this book. It helps me know what I am looking for in my collection of white milk glass.
4,wicked and twisted,"i'm a fan of ambient/experimental music, and this cd is a complete turnaround for ambience positively... all the sounds made on this cd were by Marco Corbelli and his analog synth which gives a nightmarish feel to the album. I personally am not a fan of experimental noise but it actually gives a kind of impression from a project called atrax morgue. Like a bad dream synthesizers swell and spit out white-noise distortion.A purely violent attack on your ears and sanity.GET IT AND FIND OUT!!!"
1,Formula changed along with bottle!!!,"This body spray was by far the best smelling stuff I've ever used...untillllll...they changed their formula. The original formula in the bottle which is shown was amazing; the new formula in the newly designed bottle is watered down with much less vanilla than before. If you will compare the ingredient list, you will see the fragrance now comes third in line after the water and alcohol whereas it used to be the second ingredient after the water. I'm very disappointed with their changes. I will now try to locate something similar to their original aroma. Sad that they have compromised their products. I feel they will lose many customers besides myself which will result in a greater loss for them."
3,Okay.,"When you have a laptop with no HDMI out or DVI out, and is left with only S-video. This cord gets the jobs done, overall bad video quality sound quality is great. So I recommend if you have DV6700, get this cord."
5,Works amazingly.,"I wanted to watch movies on my television from my laptop, but I didn't have an HDMI port, so I went with the next best thing: s-video. This cord was PLENTY long to stretch from the tv to the couch, very durable, and the quality is great. It worked right out of the box, and, for the price, was an absolute steal.I would very much recommend this product."
2,4-pin vs 7-pin S-Video plug,"Nothing wrong with the product or the seller.I purchased this knowing that my laptop Dell Vostro had a 7-pin S-video out. However, research on the internet said that 4-pin would work on the 7-pin. So I bought this 4 pin, received it promptly from seller, and tried it out.Audio worked fine, but video did not work.I tried a different HP laptop, which had a 4-pin S-video out. Video and audio did work, but the display on TV screen was black and white.My TV has a S-video input, but it's in the back. The RCA plugs were in front, that's why I went with S-video to RCA. Going to buy different cables, 7-pin S-video out to 4-pin S-video in, and hopefully that works.It could just be my TV, and that I should have used S-video to S-video cable in the first place."
3,Probably go with the 7 pin,"So I bought this to hook up my laptop to my tv. It was very easy to do this, but almost impossible to get the screen to be clear and the sound quality to be good. I read reviews that said you could use a 4 pin instead of 7 pin and because the 4 pin cable was longer and cheaper I bought this one. Next time I will stick with the 7 pin so that I get a screen that isn't blurry."
3,Works great.... but not for all equipment.,This item works great with one of my TVs and one of the computers in the residence. It appears that for most people with most machines the product works great but there is a small chance it will not.
1,Worst quality product I have ever purchased,I would better give zero to this product.I ourchased this from Amazon and the plug which we insert into laptop came out in one week.i did not expect sucha product from Amazon.I would not buy from/suggest this seller in the future.
1,bad,Not a good movie. They cheated the main character from the first movie back to life and most of the special effects are recycled.
3,Nuggets,"This book is brings inspiration....some I have just leafed right through, but there are some golden nuggets to savor."
4,"Unconventional sound adventures, deviant & transgressive bleeps . . .",Track Listing:(1) Marumari (USA) -- a girl i met at the rest stop(2) Marumari -- the computer kid(3) Schneider TM (DE) -- KPTM b diskursive(4) Massimo (IT) -- tonali(5) Massimo -- where's your heel(6) Goem (NL) -- comp negen(7) Ultra Milkmaids (FR) -- mystik 2k(8) Phenom (UK) -- data control(9) Phenom -- don't vote for your enemies
5,Unique Gift for Rat Lovers!,"Okay, so rat lovers will never compete with purebred dog fanciers in the calendar and tee shirt and ""I (heart) My Pet"" knick-knack market... but those who love fancy rodents will find this calendar a must-own! The portraits capture the essence of rattiness... in the best possible way!"
1,Fire,I would not buy this product it shorted out and threw sparks from the bottom. The maker of this brand has gone out of business.
1,not lasting bulb,"This bulb ,which came in good condition and worked when I put in did not last a month. IN the past this build lasted a year.I do not leave the lamp on while not being used. It only gets a few hours of in service to me for my work.IT is not the lamp.THese bulbs have to be ordered and are not cheap. No one carries them locally anymore.I am sure since i used it, it can not be returned. THe packaging long since thrown away.SO if you need this bulb, I hope you have deep pockets. better order two or three, as they go out."
5,Set sail with a great read!,"Extremely well written history and analysis of the cruise industry. This book covers not only how the industry developed but looks into the personalities of the people that created it and the impact cruise ships have on society. Even if you are not a big cruise fan, this is a great business book, but if you are a cruise fan, it is a must read."
5,Reads like a luxury cruise,Brilliantly written and a pleasure to read. Will forever change your perspective on an entire industry.
4,Cruise Line History Tour de Force,"Highly detailed and chatty description of the origins of the modern cruise industry. Easy, flowing narrative chock full of interesting details. Informative and entertaining. Good value."
5,Handsome office clerk hooks up with sensitive dock worker.,"ERNESTO(Italy, 1979) Director: Salvatore Samperi. Cast: Martin Halm, Michele Placido, Virna Lisi. Color. In Italian with English subtitles. Running time: 90 minutes. Rated R.Set in the Italian port of Trieste in 1911, ERNESTO is the coming-of-age chronicle of 17-year-old Ernesto, a handsome office clerk who dreams of becoming a violinist. An unexpected tryst with a sensitive dock worker open the youth to feelings he has previously been afraid to confront."
3,Wonders of Swamps is a good overview,"This little book provides a nice, quick glance at the myriad of ""swamp"" areas around the globe. It could serve as a good introduction to a wetlands unit for a lower elementary science teacher to read to his/her class or for individual reading by upper elementary students. Caitlin's descriptions, augmented by Watling's watercolors, offer children a basic knowledge of wetlands as well as an appreciation of their variety."
1,not sturdy enough,"I have a mini dachshund and while the kennel I bought was perfect, this pad was awful. It was the perfect size for the crate and it seemed to be nice and comfortable. The problem was that he was able to chew it up in about ten minutes. Given the size of the pad, I assume it was meant for small dogs. Most small dogs are chewers and mine is no exception. Once he got a hole in the pad, he pulled out all the filling. It was a huge mess. I would not recommend this pad to anyone who has a dog that chews on things."
4,As always an enjoyable read,"Xiaolong provides:An enjoyable read.A rendering of office politics and the slog of day-to-day police work.Wry comments on contemporary Chinese society and politics. I have read many of his books.I mostly read his books for the insight into present day China; and the fact that he provides a good viewpoint from the viewpoint of the hero Inspector Chen Cao. Whom he seems to allow to ""speak for himself"" in the stories.Ray"
3,Doesn't moisturize my hair,"I have 3c/4a natural hair and this is not good to use as a daily sealant, but as a prepoo. It makes my hair crispy when I use it as a sealant."
4,Hair oil works well for hot oil treatments!,I purchased this hair oil from a local specialty store. The scent of the oil is of spices and not of coconut - that surprised me since the 1st listed ingredient is coconut oil. I use this product as a moisture sealant for my hair. My purchase was much more reasonably priced from the local merchant than listed here for the same sized product. Good hair oil!
2,a different number every time,"Pros: It's quick, easy to use, speaks loudly enough to understand, and has a talking clock feature as a bonus.Cons: When I take my temperature 5 times in a row, I get 5 different readings, with as much as 1 degree F between the lowest and highest. I suppose that's what they meant by 0.5 degree F accuracy in the fine print."
5,Great Bowls!,These bowls are very versatile. They are lightweight and safe for oven and dishwasher and are resistant to breaking and chipping. I'm very satisfied with my purchase.
5,A masterpeice of writting!!!,"Feist's book 'Shadow of a Dark Queen' is a great adventure, worthy of praise. The story revolves around an honest, hard working boy named Erik and his mischivous companion Rupert Avery, as they are thrust into the army and shipped off to face unspeakable horrors together. During that time Erik and Roo learn the art of warfare, as they are chased about the continent of Novindus by the Serpent Queen's army of malicious Sauur. The plan of the Queen of darkness is to pilage the world, and only Erik, Roo, and the other men in his small company are left to stop her"
5,Hooks you and doesn't let go,Couldn't put it down. If you liked the Riftwar Saga thenthis will keep you glued to the pages also. Does a greatjob of drawing out each character out in detail withoutboring you.
1,Why people like this stuff is a mystery to me...,"This is the first Feist I've ever read, and the last I'll ever read. The only epic fantasy I've ever enjoyed has been Weis & Hickman, but I thought, hey, this guy's popular enough; maybe there's something to him. So, I read the whole thing, just so I'd be able to tell for sure that I didn't like it. Well, SOMETIMES I've discovered good books that way--not in this case, though. I swear, this reads like something I would've written in eighth grade. Plot? Hackneyed. Characters? Cliched and boring. Action? Plodding. I don't understand how people can enjoy this. It's really not worth your time to read."
1,I regret buying this item!,The numbers are peeling off both the front and back and this was a Christmas gift for my 10 year old son. He has been in teers because it is in such bad shape. What a disappointment.
2,"Cheap, you can do better","This toaster broke one month after warranty expired. Came home one day and my 16 year old son said he tried to use it but couldn't figure out how. Probably because timer is a clumsy dial and not very intuitive. Now it turns on and off only. Light is always on. Smells like burning rubber. It has a peculiar hooking thingy that pulls out the tray when you open the door. Great when it works, but somehow it gets in the way more than it helps. I wound up bending them so that they stayed out of the way. I'm going to buy another cheap oven because I like them small like this one. But no more Black and Decker."
1,Never buy this product!,"For some reason Black and Decker decided to replace the tried-and-true push button with a timer dial. The dial on our unit never worked well and was hard to control before it broke. Then, at about six months the timer broke entirely and won't work at all now. Hence, the toaster is totally useless and non-functional. I called for warranty service, but I didn't have my receipt. The customer service rep told me to look for codes on the unit's plug that would help her determine the age of the unit, and therefore whether it would still be under warranty. I found the codes, and her immediate response was, ""nope, not under warranty, it's more than a year old."" When I asked how old the unit was, based on the codes I supplied, her response was, ""I'm sorry, that information is proprietary and for our use only.""This is a horrible product design, and no one should buy a unit like it until Black and Decker changes it."
4,A must have bit for power drivers,These bits are an ok replacement for a similar type I bought years ago at either Rockler or Woodcraft. They lack a detent ring on the shank which allows the bit to snap/lock into a spring loaded chuck but are otherwise quite serviceable.
3,"Pretty good, not great","There is not as much variety in the recipes in this book as I would have hoped. The ones that are there are, however, very good."
2,Very hard to stay focused,"The book has a lot of very useful information, however it was very hard to stay focused. It's really drawn out. I caught nyself reading a paragraph and having to go back and read it again to understand it."
5,great source of multicultural biographical info,this is an excellent book for teachers because it provides information on a variety of people from many different backgrounds and talents.
5,Great!,"I love this leash! Very comfortable and easy to use. I walk my dog in town, on some busy city sidewalks, and this leash allows the extra control needed to keep the dog close, without having to wrap the leash around my hands, or leave it hanging. If you have a larger dog, this leash is perfect!"
2,Doesn't work well with Dewalt tools,"I expected the bits in this set to work with my Dewalt impact driver, funny some may say, but true. However, all of the double-headed bits are not keyed, so they just fall right out of the driver, and since that was one of the main reasons I purchased the set, it was disappointing. The smaller bits can be used in the magnetic extender, but they fall out fairly often also."
3,Good,"DEWALT DW2163 37 Piece Screwdriving Set with Tough Case, strong case, bits are sturdy. but not to much variety in the selection some are almost the same. If u need it buy it.If not leave it alone. I bought it because i purchased a DEWALT cordless drill.Cant have a tool with no attachments."
4,It just plain works,"If your tired of looking for a three button mouse, buy this one. No drivers to worry with, just plug it in and your good to go."
5,Life Changing!,I was given this book as a gift for my 17th birthday. I am now 24 and have read it 12 times. It is a life changing book! Absolutely amazing! The story is so intense and thought provoking- you can't put it down! I especially like that the author included the evidences of the true church in the back of the book as a reference for anyone who has questions.Read it! You will be forever changed for the better!
2,I find Rodney Yee very difficult to listen to and follow,"I bought the AM tape because I really enjoyed the PM tape with Patricia Walden. Unfortunatly, I found the yoga poses to be difficult for beginners and hard to follow from the verbal descriptions. I also find Rodney Yee very annoying and hard to listen to."
5,Breath of Fresh Air,"I saw the preview on one of your morning shows, as he gave an instructional lesson. Boy, I never knew tai chi was so simple! I've always seen people practicing tai and thought, ""Oh, what a bunch of wierd-doe's!"" Now, I know what it did for me on that one morning and the feeling of rejuvenation, it was great! Now I want to share it with everyone! I'm buying the video to share with my family and making it a morning ritual before we begin our day!"
1,not a good choice,"i take yoga at the ymca, and bought this tape for home use. there is very little advice on poses - the tape assumes the viewer will just comprehend the poses. there is no discussion of breathing until the very end, and only a couple of sentences; breathing is an integral component of yoga. the tape does not teach beginners, nor does it challenge experienced students. the beach scenes are pretty, but looking at the sun rising is not why i got the tape. it is not a good choice."
2,This book is just confusing,"I bought this book right before I went to Japan, and the only time I read it was when I was on the plane. It is not an easy book to read. The book is split in half, one side is all Japanese, and the other half is all roma-ji. The main problem is that one side looks so nice with just Japanese characters, but the other side is just a mess. I learned to read and write the romanized characters differently, so it is confusing for me to try and read the roma-ji. Some of the translations feel a little bit strange to read as well. I don't know anybody who talks the way sentences are translated into English.This book was first published in 1987, but if you look at it, it feels like it was made in the 60's. Don't waste your time with this book. It is just frustrating and you'll get annoyed flipping back and forth trying to learn."
2,Under powered laser sight,"This laser site should use 3 batteries to complete voltage, but battery holder will only accomodate 2. Keep looking folks, this is not a good product for the price."
4,Not half bad...,"Alright then.Pros:-Strong Laser Dot-Comes with Batteries-Cheap-Arrives at a timely manner-Meant for Piccatinny railsCons:-No instructions on how to adjust laser-Laser dot is usually off center and needs electrical tape around the laser housing so that the clasps will hold it in placeAll in all not a bad addition for my project salvo, but needs some ""customization"" for maximum accuracy. I got it instead of a laser dot sight because you cant exactly rest your head with a mask on against the gun to aim."
5,makes you smile,"If you like the Man in Black, you'll like this book. That's it, simple as that. It seems almost stream of consciousness in places, like you're on his porch with him and he's just telling you stories. Nothing earth-shattering, but some words of wisdom and no apologies."
2,Tedious,"I loved the movie, ""Walk The Line"". Since the movie was based on this book, I figured it would be a great read. Some of it has been interesting, but I'm not a religous person and I find all of the spiritual talk tedious. I'm only 3/4 of the way through the book and it will be a struggle to finish it. I skipped a whole chapter last night because it was all about scripture. Not my thing!"
4,"Not bad, really.","This book is not bad. If you're a Johnny Cash fan, it is a must have. The only problem I had with this book is that at times, it feels like I'm listening to an old man ramble on and on."
3,Johnny Cash - the autobiography,"This is a very readable book. The writing is simple, yet interesting. It reads just like Johnny Cash is having a conversation with the reader. Thumbs up."
3,Spiritual Story lacking candour!,"It seems to me that I need to read between the lines of this book to get any details out of it. I guess Johnny Cash never had an affair, he never did heroin with his daughter, and he spent most of his life prayin. Well, there was some spiritual consolation, but alot of preaching. Yet somehow, I want to recommend it....Sorry."
3,Just fine for the price,"The design is truly small, good for travels. The sound quality is not very good, it is very low but for the price I didnt expected much more than that. It is fair enough for the price. If you are in your office or inside your hotel room, you have to put them close to your spot so you can hear well."
1,a complete waste of time and money!!!!!!,"After purchasing the product and realizing that the speakers didn't come with an adapter and only came with a usb cable, for the ""travel speakers""....the frickin thing broke after 4 days of light use. Not worth the time or money!!!!!!"
1,Only pictures,"If you are a beginer in pond building and you need everything explained to details, do not buy this book. I bought it and it's just not good. You can read it under a hour and you'll see only pictures with nothing on them."
4,Present for grandaugter,"We ordered this as a present for our grandaughter's upcoming birthday. Nice looking toy but it is small. Approximately 8"" tall by 2"" thick. I didn't see the size mentioned anywhere so we really didn't know how big it would be. Other than the 1.1 lbs mentioned. A previous reviewer said it was small though. Again, a nice looking toy. We think she'll like it but could have been bigger."
4,The NewTestament and Early Christainity,"A very good survey of the literature in the New Testament and the first generations within the early church.Michael EnsleyBeamsville,Ontario"
4,excelent rendition of the shawnee people in story formate,"Thorm takes you into the world of the shawnee indians from the begining of their oral history to present day, as seen through the eyes of a young boy as he spends the night guarding the tribal alter and sacred items. during this time the sacred items, one by one, take him on a journy back in time and explain their importance to his people, then and now. this book is well writen, colorfull, and easy to read will be enjoyable for any age, background or culture."
2,Why did you ruin it?,Just terrible acting with a few that aren't totally incompetent. Awesome idea for a low budget sci-fi movie and poor editing along with poor directing and generally a really weak character background or development. Misses EVERY mark. There is a reason they can't get anyone to distribute this trash. I'd wanted to see it after I found the trailer and regret wasting time on it.
2,clunky...but functional,I have a Katana and needed a way to sync my contacts. The Handset Manager does an adequate job. Too bad additional Katana functionality is not available from this or another vendor.
1,"XL should be in ""children's wear""","My wife recently ordered this sweatshirt for herself. When it arrived we both thought it would only fit our young 12 year old grand-daughter, Heads up on the size."
3,"Easy read, annoying at time","Well, I'll first say that I enjoyed the book. It was a quick read and I enjoyed hearing a little back story of the characters. I really don't know how much you could get out of this book without seeing the series though. As many have pointed out, there are inconsistencies in the book. Some are bigger than others. There were however, many instances when I had to say to myself ""He would never say that."", ""They would never have done that."" but that's just because I know the series inside and out perhaps. All in all, it's a light read with some good parts."
2,my review,I just wanted to point out the fact that the author changed the story of brian's bracelet. In the third season of the show Justin says that Brian got the bracelet in Mexico and his initials are written on one of the shells. It was not bought by michael at a craft show.
3,Good but,Good album from Elektryczne Gitary front man and composer - bit too much whimsy and less focused than usual but all EG fans will want it.
5,love Shamira!,"This is a great dvd. The beginning part of the dvd is a breakdown of like 22 different moves, dance steps, etc... Then there are 3 different choreographies with different levels of difficulties. You definitely get your money's worth with this dvd. Shamira is a great teacher."
5,"Engaging, thorough instruction dvd",Shamira is an engaging persona who thoroughly covers so many different steps. These bellydance steps are a great collection to add to one's bellydance choreographies. She breaks them down consisely and does it so gracefully. She then puts these steps together in 3 different choregraphies. Each combination gradually more difficult than the next. Shamira has such a joyous dancer spirit.
4,Lots of fun,"The ""Pure Technique"" segment is great for learning the moves themselves, but I usually skip to the combinations at the end. They're loads of fun. I usually switch between this video and The Sensuous Workout 1 to mix things up, but the other one is better for a longer, systemized workout. This one is good to have some fun with and get the heart pumping if you don't have as much time or to spice up your existing routine."
5,"I love this book. It had romance, humor, love and love.","I loved this book mainly for the characters. They were so funny together. Almost reminded me of the other couple in Loretta Chase's book Lord of Scoundrels. There are some parts of the book that I laughed so hard, I had tears rolling off my cheeks and other parts that I truly felt for the heroine. What an amazing skill to bring words so to life that you could feel as well as imagine. Can't wait for the next book from this author. If you are reading this, can you continue with Ren's friends."
1,Drops messages,"Features like sound quality and message memory size are irrelevant when the answering machine fails to record messages. Unless the message is extremely loud, this unit fails to record normal volume messages, presumably because it believes them to be ""silence"". Otherwise the features are alright. The price is low; set up is straightforward; the display shows how many messages are saved. As long as you don't care whether messages are saved in the first place, go ahead and get this unit."
1,Only the first cd is any good.,"What is this stuff for anyway? Sound torture?The first cd is ambient ""space music"" although it ends on a light industral note. CD 2 pick up on the industrial part but degenerates into torturous noises and screaming. CD 3, forget it. I had to listen to these in order to test them for skipping since the discs looked like they may skip.I felt like smashing my player getting through disc 3. Since my cd player is a 3 disc player, it was nearly heavenly when Clay Aiken's cd just happened to come on after that 3rd cd was over!!!!!!!!! Folks, if Megadeth came on it would have been a relief!It is also good that I did not listen to all three discs at once!!!!!Now for the price of a used copy, disc one is worth it for the ambient music. Maybe use the other two for Halloween parties or to torment someone for pi--ing you off.Speaking of torment, opening the packing is a torment."
1,Yawn.,"I thought the plot of this book was terribly simplistic. I got through the first 300 pages or so of uninspiring material and found the climactic scene especially disappointing. I have played Magic for several years and was bored with this book. Rabid Magic enthusiasts might like it, but avid fantasy readers should look for something else."
3,not as good as the normal ones,"These things don't work remotely as well as teh filter which came with my Viks unit. I would have to replace the water with the orginal filter in the morning, these filters only help lift half the water of the old ones."
3,Not bad for the price,This forecaster was alittle difficult to configure and did not automatically obtain the time as another forecaster that I purchased at the same time.
4,Nice little weather station,"This is a very nice atomic clock + thermometer set. Its accurate(so I sync all my clocks with this unit), has the remote transmitter, and nicely priced. I've had it for a few months, and glanced at it every morning to monitor the outside temp in the comfort of my kitchen. I've had lots of compliments from friends and relatives, asking about this product. This will make a great Christmas gift, so I'm picking up a couple more when they go on sale again.I would give it 5 stars, but the remote sensor seems to have developed a problem. I've changed the batteries after about 6 months, but I still can not get readings from the sensor. I'll try to reset everything and switch channels when I have some time."
3,"Good product idea, bad design for wall mount","I bought this to replace another oregon scientific unit that was dropped and broken. This one has more features, but the small lcd screens make it horrible for wall placement unless you have the best eagle eyes in the world. The outdoor unit does seem pretty water resistant as it sits in the rain a bit.The thermometer in the main unit is spot on but the outdoor unit seems to read a bit too cold (ie. lower than it really is). My transmission distance is about 15 feet through a rock wall and has always been good. I've been going on 5 months on the same batteries, and no replacements needed yet. I have not tested the range to it's limits, but I have tried 30 feet through the rock wall and it still worked.the curved plastic of the unit makes it sit pretty far from the wall too unlike the old flush units. I find this a decent value for the cheap price, but I'd say to spend more for a larger and more readable screen from across the room."
3,"Nice, but I can't get the Atomic part to work!","This was a great value; indoor-outdoor thermo, weather forecaster, alarm clock...BUT it is also an Atomic clock I am not picking up any signals! I live in Baltimore where i should have no issues. But still...nothing"
5,Laugh out loud funny!,"I really like the PennDutch Inn series, but this is my favorite. Magdelena Yoder is a mennonite who owns a bed and breakfast. She is preparing for her wedding when she finds a body in the cask of saurerkraut she has been given."
4,This is a great introduction to philosophical thinking.,"_Confrontations with the Reaper_ is a good introduction to philosophical thinking. It is very well written and full of life. Many classroom discussions will pour from its pages.The philosophy club at my college is using this text for a discussion along with Camus, Woody Allen, and _The Bagavad Gita_.The only problem with it is that it is so analytic that it seems to suggest materialism as an idea human state to be in, but that's just my personal problem with the book.If you're studying the philosophy of death or are in a college philosophy club this one's a great pick."
2,Dissapointing,Most chapters focuse on explaining various definitions. There are not substantial metaphysical analyses. I can't believe that this book was published by OUP. Dissapointing.
1,Great picture before it goes black,I bought this TV because I wanted a quality product..This TV has a great picture and the salesman claimed it was the best Quality available but after 1 year the picture is black. $400 to fix it - BUY A SONY or go to Wal-Mart and buy a cheap flat screen. This does not seem to be isolated to this model but a Toshiba problem and Toshiba seems to look at is as the consumers problem.
5,Milestone in progessive history,This cd is not easy to listen to. I mean what is the use in buying a car you already know how to drive or marrying a girl you already...But it is still worth picking up. Certain tracks here are a rarity for even the Sasha fan such as Baja and Rabbitweed. I am sure we all know and are almost sick of Xpander and Belfunk. Too overplayed because of their brilliance.Still worth picking up though.Interesting aside: This cd helped confirm my long held suspicion that Sasha has a soft spot for the middle eastern sound. Virtually all his major mixes have at least the second opening track with just a trace of that ultra cool raj like vibe with despondent male vocals.Highest recommendation.
1,Sandburgs Lincoln,Just got my copy of Sandburgs Lincoln I was so happy untill I put it into my DVD player. Was I surprised to see the movie had no video but audio . I guess it's always true you get what you pay for in this case nothing. For those of who might think it was my DVD player it wasn't because all the other dvds in the order worked well. I've been asked many times by amazon to review my orders. I only do that if something is wrong.
1,Horrible,"Sound quality horrible from the very beginning. Continuous loud buzz.Video quality even worse than the sound! Lines running through the image.The first one I have returned for the reasons above thinking it was defective. Second device just as bad.Channel changer no longer works after 2 months, neither the remote nor the actual buttons on the device.Overall a horrible product. Stay away."
4,Works great!,"Works great, and much better than those manual ones that you have to turn. The only thing I wish this had is automatic turn on/off feature when it notices that a unit that it's plugged into has turned on. Then I would give it a 5/5."
5,Works Great,"The DVD part of my surround sound system died so I got a new blue ray player. This product allowed me to use the optical out from my cable box and the blue ray player with the one input on my surround sound system. Once hooked up, it is as easy as pushing a button. The only thing I would do is try to figure out how to program my remote to control this as well, then it will be perfect!"
3,for kids room only!,"This bench is lovely and all that...it truly is, easy to put together, quality is nice, only one thing-it's not large enough for an entry way or mudroom. This bench is best used for a kids room."
1,Save your money visit the website first,I was profoundly disappointed in the book I received. I was looking for more substance and a manual that I could learn from. Instead what I received was a very thin paperback book that in essence was an advertisement to attend their seminars. I am searching for answers and was frustrated by the dead end this book presented. If you are not going to be able to attend a seminar soon such as I myself am ill and unable to travel. I am working on the health of my mind during my long periods of time down. This did not provide me with a complete enough structure to learn of this method without now attending a seminar. I would love to get my money back! And am less likely to attend a seminar now as I feel cheated.
2,Fluffy,"Introduces the subject in the most general terms. Does introduce muscle testing, but overall, the book appears to be a thinly disguised marketing piece. Somewhat disappointing.On the other hand, it may be that muscle testing, a key component used to access the subconscious, is one of those subjects that must be learned through direct experience."
1,PROMOTIONAL BLURB,"Psych-K by Rob Williams. This is a very expensive paperback in its class, most run about half this price. It contains is very little that is helpful and a lot of promotions for Mr. William's workshops. If he is going to publish promo material all well and good but it at least ought to be cheap. This book is definitely not worth the money. Invest your book money on Bruce Lipton and others who are more generous and more helpful."
2,This book is an ad for the workshops,"I didn't find this to be a how-to book at all. Since that's what I wanted, I was disappointed. I've learned more watching youtube videos about the techniques."
5,The Ugly American,"Reading this book after spending the last nine years working for the U.S. Army I see that our people are continuously making the same mistakes in foreign lands.Through arrogance, disinterest and ignorance we continue to alienate ourselves from the rest of the world. This book accurately predicts the mistakes we've made in Korea, Vietnam and now in Afganistan.A must read for anyone that plans on traveling or working abroad...David M Farrands"
4,Thought Provoking,The book is well written and entertaining while allowing the reader to experience on many levels some of the bright and dark spots of historical American foreign policy.
4,industry standard,"Raco is the industry standard for electrical parts, for a reason. I always receive good quality when I purchase Raco parts for my electrical projects."
1,This book is terrible,"This book is nothing more than a jumbled attempt at regurgitating technical jargon. It does little in the way of explanation, instead relying on overly-complicated repitition of definitions and formulas. PROFESSOR LEITHOLD, KEEP IN MIND YOU ARE TRYING TO TEACH!"
5,Destined to become a classic album,"Simple yet elegant. Distinctive but easy to listen to. The sort of CD you'd have out ready to play if having guest/s over.Pete's distintive vocals mixed with his acoustic and bluesy at times feel makes this album an example of individual songwriting skill and composition. From the riff driven ""Feeler"" to the melancholy ""Beautiful"", this album deserves the recognition it is getting in Australia. I just hope Pete's subsequent albums dont become watered down by complexity, commercialism and popular demand."
2,Fuzz Luvz - Pink,"Hi,Fuzz Luvz - PinkI bought this toy for my 9 year old daughter during my last visit to the USA. She found it cute but is very sad because on the box says you are going to receive a gift from the FUzz (a baby) and since last September, nothing has appeared, which leads me to believe this one was not pregnant... Don't you have a Quality Assurance for this kind of toy. Also, I am in Brazil now and how could I exchange my daughter's toy for another that actually has a baby?Thank you!Meire"
4,"Good, Quick, Makes-You-Smile Read","Good, easy, captivating and heart-warming observations on the state and nature of our lives and our world with emphasis on strong traditional moral values. A feel good, makes-you-smile and sometimes provocative read, and there's nothing wrong with any of that!! Pretty good, actually. It makes us appreciate and think about the world around us in a new way, perhaps."
3,"Yes, I wonder, too","But amateur sleuths are always nosy about something and if they weren't, their authors would be writing other stories. I thought that this was one of the more intricate entries in this series and I enjoyed it a lot."
2,"If you need to cram for an exam, don't buy this!?","I got this book used from a friend : he said it was no use to him.I read it and even with a broad background in acoustics,systems dynamics, physics and mathematics, I could barely make head or tails of it.Stuff like curvature and matrices are universal, but what this lacks isexplanation that to comprehensible to a new comer.Since I used the physics Schaum's outline to get me through college physics whenthe Feynman text was the ""new"" physicsand my professors were just jolly bad,I say this to help not harm.If Schaum's company wants to help:assign a new guy to write a better outline!If your text is bad and your teacher is badand the teaching assistants are clueless,this book won't help you."
3,Good but expensive from WSports,"This product fixes the problem of getting spilled on when drinking from a wide mouth Nalgene bottle (okay when camping, not okay at the office). The product itself is great, though apparently not made by Nalgene any more.I Ordered one on March 21, 2011 through Amazon from WSports for $[..] plus $[...]shipping = $[..] total.Ordered another same day through Amazon (sold by MadAthlete fulfilled by Amazon) for $6.50 and qualified for free shipping = $[...] total.Same exact product, except for color. Now (April 20, 2011) I see WSports has a $[...] price, not $[...]I recommend you buy the one sold by MadAthlete. WSports doesn't seem competitive."
1,The Guyot style works better.,"Was given one of these by a friend. It is hard plastic, doesn't work well with off-brand bottles. Buy a Guyot, they conform to Nalgene and off-brand bottles and they work 10 times better."
1,Zoom Lens,"This lens is not very user friendly. It came with very little information about the lens, and nothing in the box said that it would work for my camera. True, it connects to my camera, but every picture that I have taken when I have been zoomed in, comes out blurry. I wish I had not bought this item."
1,Dont Waste your Money,As said in other review the Tips aren't really there and there is some bad info which could mess up your engine .. no worth the paper its printed on look else where
5,"A ""MUST READ"" for aspiring filmmakers!","This book is great!! For anyone who wants to make a movie, but make it their way, not some formulaic Hollywood crap, should definitely check this book out. Lloyd Kaufman knows all the tricks. Not just how to make your movie, but how to make sure it's the movie you want to make, with no one interfering with your creative process. There are a host of low budget tips and tricks. Plus, this is easily the funniest book about film making I have ever read. It's chock full of some outrageously funny stories from Lloyd's 35+ years in the business. And the forward is written by none other than the creator of ""South Park"", Trey Parker. How can you go wrong? This is definitely a a great addition to any movie fan's library. Also, I'm absolutely planning on getting his new book ""Direct Your Own Damn Movie"". I'm sure it's gonna be great too!!"
5,Perversely Inspiring,"Is this book funny? Sure, often hysterically. But it's much more -- Lloyd Kaufmann, perhaps the nastiest sweet man on the planet, reveals invaluble truths, secrets and techniques to indie filmmakers. Between the profane, self-immolating anecdotes, Kaufmann provides the skinny on surviving in the trenches of low/no budget moviemaking. Very few filmmaking books are by real filmmakers, and Kaufmann is a quirky, much underrated auteur with a style and vision that rivals John Waters (that the Troma guru's films are funny, entertaining and smart is often lost on critics and even viewers, caught up in his punk theatrics). Even if you have a real budget of several hundred thousand dollars or even a mil, Kaufmann has much to teach you, and -- between the laughs -- sobering truths to share. As an indie director myself, I wish I'd had this book to guide me on my first effort; and I still find it useful and perversely inspiring."
5,Excellent book both honest and entertaining,"The book covers details regarding making films. Lloyd offers a humorous yet honest views on creating your own independent art work. He explains pitfalls and difficulties he has occurred. Troma has been on of the most successful of the independent films as well as having many cult icons such as ""The Toxic Avenger"" as well as ""Sgt Kabukiman NYPD""."
5,Entertainment AND Education!,"This is a great book for anyone looking to make a movie with little or no budget. Loads of down to earth, real life tips to inspire you to go out there and make a movie! And if by some chance you decide not to make your own movie, or don't want to make one but want to read about it, this book is ideal because it has loads of humor - the stories told within the pages are great, and amount to real life examples of how things can, and will, go wrong during the making of a low budget film. So all up this book is entertainment which also educates and gives a reality check to anyone who is thinking about making a movie and living a rich and glamorous lifestyle. Grab it!"
5,Making My Own Damn Movie,"I met Lloyd Kaufman last year at Tromadance, and being the shameless self-promoter that he is, he told me to read ""Make Your Own Damn Movie."" At that point, I wasn't sure that I wanted to make a film, but after reading this book, despite the horrific details of herding crew and placating civilians, I was convinced. It was time for me to make my own damn movie. Now in the murky depths of preproduction, I use this book as a reference guide and for a good laugh. I have sentences and entire paragraphs underlined. This book brings filmmaking to the level of the common man with such humility that it makes you feel like it's an attainable (if not abominable) feat for anyone. Lloyd Kaufman's unparalleled wit is inTOXICating. His advice is excellent and so enjoyable to read that it will inspire would-be filmmakers and entertain even those who have no interest in it at all."
5,Making my own damn movie,"I am in the midst of making my own damn movie, and you know what? Now that I have read this book, I never need to go to college just to get an exciting career making crap money. I can do it on my own, as an independent filmaker. Although the love of my life and myself may be poor and malnurished, there is at least one thing that makes eating nothing or processed cheese sandwichs worthwhile.In all seriousness, this book really helped me. I now know some of the things to expect to go wrong, and great directions on how to do it right. Troma has helped inspire me. They proved that I can do it my own damn self. Thanks troma, and thank you Lloyd."
1,no results,"such a waste of 30 dollars, my son got really sick and basically forgot to return it, guess I'll keep for summer if I get sunburned"
4,Recommended by my dermatologist,I live in cold weather country and develop fissures on my fingers in the winter. This product has prevented this painful condition. It is a bit greasy but effective.
5,Love it!,it is the best cheap moisturizer I ever use. this moisturizer so gentle to my acne skin and doesn't irritated at all. it is a thick cream but absorb very well and it keep my skin balance. Love this product so much!
2,Overrated,"My skin is dry again after 6 hours of applying the lotion. It goes on well, but the medicated smell would make you think that it's super effective. Good for sensitive skin, but it doesn't treat eczema any better than other products for a fraction of the cost. Not recommended."
2,made.eczema.worse,I thought with so many good reviews it would work for my 18 month old. Maybe she is allergic to something in it but it makes her eczema even drier and flakier and now she is waking up at night scratching herself. But I gave it 2 stars becuase oddly it is the only cream to help my dry heels and feet. So i am on the hunt again for something to relieve my daughters hand and body eczema. It kind of stinks too. Pump is helpful though for ease of use.
5,Great product,"I have very sensitive skin and have tried ever lotion on the market, Aveno, Moisturel, Cephil and many more. This is the first lotion that works on my face without irratating the skin. Everybody skin is different but it definately is a winner for me."
