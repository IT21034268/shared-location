5,Never watched it,"I've never watched this to date, but the kids like it and that's all that counts as long as it's suitable materials."
5,Best Disney Sequel,My daughter begged me to watch this and we rented it on NetFlix. We loved it so much that we now own it. It is hysterical and a great story. I highly recommend this sequel for your Disney collection.
4,Works for Me,"I'm no audiophile, but I wanted better sound out of my computer so I got these. The classic microphone look of the speakers is what really drew me in. The bass is great. There are 3 settings for the bass, so it's convenient for adjusting depending on what you're listening to. As for connecting to the computer itself, all you need to buy is a .55M cord (around $5) and you can get it going. My biggest complaint is general background noise when they're on and no sound is being played, but it can be remedied by turning the volume down. Audiophiles might have issues with that though."
2,Headphone jacks LOSE CONTACT,"I am very agitated with this crap. The whole contraption is excellent instead of the headphone jacks. The jacks aren't build to stand the over-use of them which means that they only reach contact with one headphone speaker, and I gotta even press the headphone cord in SO HARD that it will have contact with both speakers. I did not find any solution to this problem."
4,Great for those interested Renaissance Venice,"This is a great book for people interested in the lives of the upper classes in Renaissance Venice. It can be a dry read for some, but is informative and interesting in its details. Based on court documents of the time, it's a great resource for documentation of essays or SCA work."
5,Beyond the Red Mountains,"I am nine years old and have read both of Ken Ramirez's books. This book was physically impossible to put down. I like how he spun golden looms of detailed pictures. In this book I enjoyed how Naida, Randin, and Hayden had to overcome many obstacles and tasks. My favorite task was when the Rock Sprite gave them the task of stopping the poison that was spreading throughout the mountain.If you enjoy fantasy, characters that come to life and seem real, never-ending adventure, and detailed descriptions you will love this book.Sydni Caet Smith"
2,no impressed with the acoustmass system,"I figured that anything from bose would be excellent but I have to say that this product is an exception. I have it hooked up to my samsung 55"" flat screen lcd tv. One of the most annoying things about this product is that the remote has to be pointed directly at the receiver for it to pick up the command. The bose wave system picks up remote signals from a far wider angle range and you dont have to be right on it but the accustamas isnt made the same way; unfortunately. The sound quality of the speakers seems average but the sub woofer is excellent."
1,Junk!,"I paid what I thought was a premium price for premium speakers which sound like cheasy 1950s paper spekers. No bass, buzzes, no dynamic range, etc. , etc. etc. These speaker are all ads, ads, ads. No delivery at all. I have them hooked up to a good Denon 200 Watt receiver, and zip performance. Nada. They sound a thousand times worse than the rotted out 20-year-old Radio Shack speakers they replace. Bose is all puff and guff!!! No wonder they dont sell in regular audio stores; no one will handle this junk!!! Garbage!!! I was ripped off!! I am going back to Radio Shack. At least I dont feel bad paying nothing for junk then. And their junk is at least priced right. Jim Isham, Penfield, NY. God, this pisses me off. Bose can go jump in the lake and take their overhyped overpriced speakers with them; tied to their feet!!!!"
1,Acoustamess,"My best friend bought one of these systems and eagerly called me over to hear it. I thought it was a simple minimal system good enough for a kids room. Then he told me how much he paid for it. I nearly fainted. The surround speakers that I built myself For under $300.00 should go for $100,000.00 by these standards. The acoustimass is not Hi-Fi. Distortion, Boomy unfocused bass, no lower mid range, no low bass, no high treble, poor sound stage and generally cheap. I thought Bose was high end stuff. This really burst my balloon."
5,great bedtime story,"If your child is having trouble sleeping at night, reading this story to them will introduce them to their own angels and bring them comforting and pleasant dreams."
1,Disapointment,"This is the first time I have ordered from Amazon and I am very disaponted with the outcome. I took advantage of applying for amazon's credit card at the time or the order. I ordered a Hp deskjet 5740 color inkjet Printer from Jennababy on Dec 6, On the 30 of Dec I complained that I still have not recieved the printer, Jennababy wrote and said she had forgotten it and it was still in the trunk of her car and that she would send it the next day and send me the tracking. On Jan 6 I notified Jennababy that I still had not recieved the printer or the tracking information. She replied that it had been sent but had lost the paper work. Today is the 20th of Jan and I still do not have the printer. What is this, fraud? I have recieved the credit card bill due Feb 1st. I'm sure Jennababy has recieved her money. If I do not have the printer very soon I will notify the credit card."
3,bed a bag,Ferrets are not really thrilled with this item. It is made well enough but they dont seem to be the least bit interested in this one.
2,Practices What He Preaches,"So, the author doesn't like Walmart selling decent merchandise at decent prices? I could tell that before I read this book. The 20 dollar price tag for a 160-page paperback book gave it away."
5,Good product....,"I purchased this for my 88 300zx, and it worked like a charm! The price was great and it was very simple to use."
3,Does't match the Theater Version,"I saw this shocker of a movie in its' ORIGINAL Theater Release. This version leaves out a few VERY GRAPHIC scenes of violence. I washoping that the version offered here would be TOTALLY UNCUT, but alas it IS has been edited for some raw content. When will somecompany have the cajones to to release the 100% UNEDITED VERSION at last ? Come on now. What's the problem. There are worse thingsbeing made TODAY as far as graphic violence is concerned."
2,Not Very Good Then (1970); Not Very Good Now!,"The Sand Creek Massacre portrayed in the worst Hollywood exploitive fashion! Stupid obligatory Hollywood love story mixed with a poorly produced Sam Peckinpah-like bloodletting. Add a decapitation of a squaw-dummy holding her doll-papoose; simulated rape of a curvaceous nude Indian maiden; a young Cheyenne boy's head exploding a-la the Zapruder-Kennedy assasination film and a young soldier (Strauss) asking, ""Why? Why?"". Good question: ""Why make such a movie?"" I can't help but recall that BOTH sides in the Indian Wars perpetrated atrocities with equal ferocity. By the end of this film you learn nothing new. ""Soldier Blue"" has developed a cult following for reasons probably based upon the simulated sex, blood and gore. It will only satisfy a cultist video-phile!"
3,Cute holiday book.,I agree it is a cute book. I was glad it wasn't a book that dragged out. It was a quick read and a nice holiday book. I loved the characters and could easily see a sequel happening maybe with the sister. I look forward to reading more of Lisa Mondello.Marla
3,Nice Read,I liked it enough to keep reading it. The story didn't keep me from putting my kindle down but I did want to finish it.
3,Made for Movie Romance,"A great Christmas romance with the charming Kyle, love shy Lauren and adorable Kristen. Kyle's family add to the realism of Christmas with your family."
3,All I Want for Christmas is You,"It was strictly a feel good holiday read. It was pretty predictable, but had a sweet message. It appeared in the Christian ebook section, but do not feel it should be listed in that category. It has a happy ending..."
5,All I want for christmas is you,"What a great story loved it. Uplifting it's the kind of stories I love to read. Well written, good wholesome values. It's the kind of book that makes you happy when you read it. And just in time for Christmas. You want to go in and look at all her books. And because all the ones I found a reasonably priced that makes it really nice. A love story without the porn. I wish more writers would write like this. The kind of book that makes you feel good about people and life."
4,An easy and good read!,"Very good Christmas book to read, or any time of the year. Just goes to show some Christmas Miracles can happen."
3,Enjoyed,Really enjoyed reading this book. It was heartfelt and a real page Turner. I was unable to put it down.
3,Good bathtub read.,It could have been better. Still a good read. I like the way this author writes. I also like that there wasn't much swearing .
4,Quick and pleasant,"I don't enjoy writing reviews. I'm certainly no author. But I do read reviews when I purchase books so I felt it only fair to give my two cents worth. I enjoyed this story. It may not have been complicated, but the characters were likeable and Ms Mondello has a nice writing style."
4,Easy fun read,"Good quick read for holidays, no surprises in the story line but relaxing characters in reality setting. Sometimes we ned to lighten up and this gets you in that mode."
4,very enjoyable,"Fate with a helping hand #1.I enjoyed this read a lot. Christmas is the time for the unthinkable. In this story that is what they find. All she want's for Christmas is a Daddy and Lauren is worried for her self and her daughter, when it comes to Santa, yes you herd right Santa. Kyle has word hard to get where he is but when he sees Lauren all starts to change in his life and he can't see life with out her or her daughter.I simply fall in love with this story. I hope you do too if you read it!"
4,Quick read,"Read this during the month of December, so it really was a sweet story. I really enjoyed it til the end. Without giving away too much, just thought the relationship moved forward way to fast, but otherwise I really liked it :-) I"
3,Mixed Feelings,"I purchased Alterknits after reading some rave reviews here and there (never having looked through the book - my own fault) and was very anxious to receive my copy through the mail.I must say I was pretty disappointed. The book itself is lovely, beautifully bound and photographed, but many of the patterns are awful...particularly the Crepe Paper Crown, which leaves me asking ""why?"" and the Unisex Deconstucted Pullover, which though shown on a male model is not at all unisex and is just plain bizarre. A few patterns are very plain garments such as tanks, wrist warmers and shawls gussied up with corset-style laces.To be fair, there are some interesting projects using felted old sweaters, but those don't really require knitting. My reccommendation would be to REALLY LOOK through the book first before purchasing."
3,Mixed feelings,"I have concerns about this gadget. First, there is not much space inside. I tried two different disk drives. In each case, the fit was so tight that I had to ""flex"" the little Adaptec circuit board to get everything assembled. I suspect that it will crack if I insert/remove disk drives too many times.More seriously, I don't think that this gadget can dissipate heat very well. True, the shell is mostly aluminum, which conducts heat well. However, the disk drive mounts onto an all plastic tray that lives inside the shell. Thus, the disk drive touches only air and plastic, neither of which are good conductors. There is no fan in this gadget either.The good news is that this gadget looks great. It is compact too, which can be a real bonus. Finally, I exercised it hard for several hours and my disk drive did not fail.Summary: I state my concerns about this gadget, but in practice nothing bad happened."
2,Not on my pc,"I would like to reiterate what I have had confirmed by others - solid and compact, but concerned about heat dissipation. The hard drive only comes in contact with plastic - not the aluminum case, so heat dissipation via the body becomes deteriorated. Also, after screw and unscrewing the unit to changes drive, only about 3 times, the screw housing popped out of the plastic base. So either get it right the first time or be very careful. If you don't need a fan, Microcenter has a house brand ""PowerSpec"" that seems solid - though the drive is not completely ""snug"" in the unit. I didn't mind this feature because the unit doesn't travel with me at all. If I were using this unit in a portable fashion I would definitely be concerned. With Adaptec's name in the industry I'm very dissappointed in the quality of this USB 3.5"" enclosure."
5,Correction regarding author's name,The author's correct name is Christopher Bird; not to be confused with Christopher O. Bird.
2,Just not what I expected,"The book is about a bunch of researchers conducting experiments with lie detector machines to measure a plants response to human thoughts, threats of harming the plant and other such things. It was extremely boring and unenlightening. I only read four chapters and gave up on it."
4,Entertaining,I enjoyed the illustrations. Reminded me of stories about my Grandmother always making clothes for Mom and her sisters. I only wish it wasn't so short of a book.
1,Boring,"No emotion... Flatline. Boring. Not really worthy of completing the read, except I purchased and started it. Don't bother, unless you like boring."
5,Perfect gift book,"This is such a great little book, full of heartwarming tales. For the last few years I have gifted this book, all with positive results. Get it in hardcover if you can, it's a keeper!"
4,Open your closet.,"I dare you to open your closet and not find at least one article of clothing that is hanging there because of how you felt wearing it or because of what happened when you wore it. We all have mental visuals of the times of our lives and in this picture are clothes. Some we loved, some not so much. Sometimes the feeling of being pretty or not so pretty in our clothing helped to construct that day. Anyway, this author figured that out and this book celebrates it. This is fun to read, and its nice to know other humans share our foibles."
2,not that I don't like it but I could do without it,Just a little bizarre cute but boring although I continued reading it just because it was a bit off the wall
3,Fluffy,"Quick read, light and entertaining, a good beach read. It had me chuckling in several places, even though i'm not much into fashion"
1,Was toying like I expected,"I was expecting a funny little novel, but it really was drawings of what she wore and a little story with it"
2,Disappointing,"I heard Nora Ephron - may she rest in peace - talk about this book on the radio and couldn't wait to jump in. Getting started I thought that the early segments must be leading up to the real meat and potatoes of Beckerman's story. Unfortunately, this never came to pass. For me, the writing was thin and shallow. I kept waiting for the poignant recollections and nothing materialized. Each passage was so brief and dry - more like a sketchbook with jotted notes, just not what I was expecting. I also didn't care for the hand drawn pictures but that could be due to the resolution on my Kindle.Too bad!"
2,Not what I expected..,"This is a cute concept for a book, and what was there was somewhat entertaining. But the stories were fairly shallow (they had to be since it was such a short book!). No real substance of any kind. And $8? I feel completely ripped off. Read the whole book in about 30 minutes, and will have no lasting memories of it. Save your money!"
3,"Good, but not a deal at all.","If you need something a bit better than the integrated speakers in your TV, get these. I don't know if I was unlucky, or all the rear right speakers are simply nonworking. It wouldn't produce the same sound as the left one (left rear speaker is 10 times better in sound quality). I thought about exchnaging at least. Still, I don't spend $100 for a 200W home theater, so it's my bad, not Amazon's. But the lack of Registration Card, or any type of warranty is a minus whe buying any type of electronics. Oh, and the hissing sound is there all the time, even when powered off. You get what you pay for ( or a bit worse)."
3,5.1?,I bought these speakers. I thought they were 5.1 speakers but there is only stereo input. How can you call this 5.1 without input for more than right and left channel??For me this was a disappointment.
5,Works great,I bought this penlet back in 2000. It has been working great now for 11 years. That's pretty good for a piece of plastic. It seems fairly sturdy. I use it with One Touch UltraSoft lancets and I have the Penlet Plus set at a low setting of about three. I am always able to get a drop of blood with one try. The shallow prick does not hurt my finger.
4,Just what I needed,I have been searching for this type of lancet device for a long time. The two I received are perfect. And I received them promptly and packaged well. Two thumbs up.
4,Great spice drawer organizer,Great product worked great for me But I can see where some people would have a hard time trimming to fit a drawer. I'm a contractor and have most everytool. when this arrived I had my Mighter saw out so I used that. because of the accordion design it was hard to keep square it the saw. It did turn out fine but I could see a novice messing it up.
4,You sent the wrong CD AGAIN!!!,I would love to review the cd. It is great. But the perplexing thing is how you could send me this CD twice when it is not the one I ordered.
1,A Dollar a minute....,"First off, I love Stott DVD's, and own quite a few.The running time listed on Amazon.com shows 130 min. which is true.What is not shown is that of those, only 29 min. are the actual workout. Other PRO Stott Pilates DVD's have at least an hour workout.For the price, I would have hoped for a more complete offering than what I got.On the plus side, the little there is seemed pretty good, but not worth the price."
2,Watch the Rating!,The game came in on time and as advertised; but I neglected to check the rating first. The language was very inappropriate for my youngsters. I trashed it.
3,25 exitos of cornelio reyna,"Most of the music on this cd was not what I expected. Although I like his singing, the songs I expected to hear were not on this cd."
1,The ratings make no sense.,I bought one of the earlier Creature Feature editions and enjoyed it. This is the first one I have seen that had ratings in it and none of these ratings seem to make any sense. In Dreams is given a very medicore review yet receives 3 stars. Right above it is Indian in the Cupboard which is given a better review than In Dreams yet only gets 2 and half stars. This is only one example of many. Also I believe the reviewer below me pointed out other mistakes. I don't care to repeat them. Most of the reviews are straight out of the other edition I purchased so I really feel ripped off.
4,very useful!,"I loved it!!!got alot of info,that i never knew of.get it,if a huge horror sleaze fan!=D"
1,Don't like MST3K? I don't trust you then...,His poor review of Mystery Science Theater 3000: The Movie is proof enough that this man has no sense.
5,A great resource for SF movie lovers!,"This updated and expanded edition is well worth the price. If you love science fiction and fantasy movies, it is a resource you can not be without. I found dozens of movies that were not listed in other movie guides, and the reviews are right on target. The index features and listing format makes it easy to find the movie you are looking for, and the large paperback format makes reading easier than in some of those small mass market paperback guides. Highly recommended.Note: I did not own the previous edition, and only use VHS, so my response is a bit different than the previous reviewer..."
2,Not as Good as it looks!,At first glance I was very excited to read this book. The large numbers of rare movie reviews interested me very much. But after a reading a number of the reviews in this book i realized this author has a taste far different from mine. Some great movies were listed as bad and some of the worst that really dont deserve to be printed on are raved upon. ...
1,PIB? Should be named POS!,"The only thing about this ""amplified"" FM antenna that is decent is the styling. However, I wasn't looking for a piece of sculpture, but a piece of useable audio equipment...what I got was this useless POS. MY FINGER TOUCHING THE ANTENNA TERMINAL WORKED BETTER! Pure garbage...I'd give it MINUS stars (5 of 'em) if that was possible. FEH!"
3,Very large transformer on coax connector,"I cannot speak to how well this product functions, as the coax connector that would hook to your stereo is very large-far to large to fit on my Panasonic SC-HC55. Find a different antenna if you have a tight space around your coax connection."
1,Mine's going back,"I got this to replace my old venerable Terk AF-1 predecessor, but this doesn't even come close. This won't even pick up two of the stations I listen to regularly. Why do they even sell this?"
2,Actually made reception WORSE than the dipole,"Attached to my Sony HD and powered it up. Stations that had been linking up just fine, dropped out. Tried different positions and gain settings, but no dice.Looks as if Terk is selling something that looks good, but doesn't perform."
4,This does work if installed properly,"I have two of these and I make sure that they are clear of any other wiring near the loop. The gain has to be adjusted to signal strength and depending upon where the station you are tuning into is located, the gain may have to be adjusted. One is attached to a Yamaha receiver that is 12 years old and the other is attached to a Yamaha HTR-6090 7.1-Channel Digital Home Theater Receiver. I get good quality on both. I don't know how or in what way the other raters were using theirs or if they had defective units, but I can say that my experience has been very good with this antenna."
3,Helps a bit,"This antenna does help but not a huge amount. I live at the fringes of radio reception and this antenna helped me to receive a few more stations and the reception is more solid (as in the stereo does not cut off as often). However, the reception is still static filled just more consistent. I suspect this product might work fairly well if one lives closer to the source of the signal and are just having problems with the metal in the building. I should also note that one needs to play with the wires a lot to get things to work right. You will need to separate the FM wire from the AM wire and keep both from the power cord. I was able to get an almost static free signal but I do not really feel that holding the antenna over my head in the middle of my living room to be a practical use of this product."
2,Utterly Pointless ... unless you're 4,"I believe - and I know I'm not alone in this - the Emporer's New Groove was one of the few movies that trascended the adult/child boundary and was bearable after, say, the 12th watching.In contrast, I feel embarrassed for this movie. I can sum it up simply: if you're a fan of the first because of it's witty, clever dialog, you will be thoroughly disappointed by its sequel. This may entertain your 4 year old (as most anything animated should), but it's painful to watch as an adult.There's a lesson to be learned here: it's rarely a good sign when films are released DVD-only; Kronk's New Groove is no exception."
1,The kind of movie that gives a bad name to sequels!,The Emperor's New Groove was a great movie. This one is an attempt to make more money out of a great franchise on the basis of a really weak product that has nothing but some of the same characters as the original one. Please don't end up throwing good money buying this heap of you know what!
1,What happened?,"The original was the FUNNIEST Disney movie that has come out in my generation. The sequel could have been good...but urgh. Where is Cuzco?!?! He MADE the first movie and now he appears 4 times. THIS is what should have happened:The father comes. Kronk can get no one to help him so he goes to Cuzco to give him land, pose as his wife, etc. While Cuzco's gone, Izma takes over. Or something like that. The funny moments were random. The plot was broken. And Cuzco was missing. Stick to the original."
3,Seems More Like 3 Episodes Of A TV Show...,"This is basically what you should expect from a Disney sequel: a shameless, mediocre plot which could play out to a couple episodes of a saturday morning cartoon. If you really really like Kronk from the movie, you'll like this if you're over the age of 10. Anyone under 10 will enjoy this, but it's not really more than a bit of family fun. I'd rent this. You may be dissapointed if you're expecting another ""The Emperor's New Groove"" but hey, just roll with it."
5,Works well for what I needed,I purchased this to dress up semi-scale RC models. Not all the pieces are the same scale but they will work for what I need and they are meant more as a toy any way.
3,This is an ok product,"I was expecting the dogs to be somewhat larger. I am glad they are realistic in appearance. My 1 yr old loves to hold the dogs & bark at them, but she must be supervised closely - these are defintely choking hazards. If I had it to do over again I would buy the Schleich dogs."
1,Not 1 ounce of Plot!!,"Give me a break.These 3 little weirdo kids with these fake stupid Ninja moves?Come on!All they do is they run,they fight,They run,they fight,they run.What do all you people think is good about this movie?!?!?This movie is so predictable!Oh,look,I was his teacher....the teacher of the bad guy!These stupid little lessons in this movie are annoying!!Oh look,I defeated him and saved the world,whopee."
3,Pretty good movie for a little kid,"I remembered watching this movie when I was a little kid, so I thought my son would enjoy it to since he's on a ""ninja"" kick. He did, but it's not going to be one he watches over and over again. It's funny how some childhood movies seem kinda cheesy when re-watched."
5,The Best Ever Made!,"This movie was so funny! I liked the part when the guy said, ""Hey, Fester, buddy, I'm not feeling so hot."" Then, ""I gotta take a major dump big time!"" I really liked the part when Rocky and Colt won their friend, Emily's bike back in a basketball game against these bullies. What else? Better watch it. Recommended!"
3,the kids will love it,the kids will love it. adults will like parts of it too. it's a good movie to watch with the whole family.
3,JR500 remote codes,"I think this remote is very good. However, finding customer support can prove to be quite difficult. Jensen was bought out by rca. If you need the remote codes you can contact me at jbellefeuille@personainc.ca"
1,"did not get the codes book , need HELP!!","WOULD APPRECIATE SOMEBODY TO SHARE THE CODES FOR JR500, I TRIED WWW.JENSENREMOTES.COM , BUT COULDN'T GET IN , THANKS!!!!!"
5,Solid!,"I use this as a deterrent on my bike and it works great. It's very heavy and the configuration I have allows me to chain the wheel and frame and hook it to a stationary object (fence, pole...). I know if someone wants it, they will get it but hopefully this will encourage them to move to an easier target."
1,horrible for againg skin,"I was so excited, when this arrived i used it the minute i got it.... but the damn moisturizer mademy skin break out also gave me a dull complextion to the point where i look almost dead..not for mature againg plotchy skin condition.. maybe if u have fair skin, but trouble skin I k its not good for."
2,One Word ... DISTORTED!!!,"I have to start by saying I love this band, but unfortunately the audio is unlistenable due to distortion.I'm not sure if the DVD sounds like the Amazon Prime Stream, but hopefully it doesn't as I really want to buy it!The show's video is well produced, the performances are top notch, but the audio just ruins the experience for me, which is too bad as it looks like quite a nice set.To sum up, buy this if you really like ska/reggae music mixed with rock, funk, soul and congas galore!And don't worry, even if the audio on the DVD is as distorted as the Prime Stream, I'm sure Amazon will gladly refund your purchase price after you return it!"
2,Non-Erotic Tales of Crime,"I would have appropriately titled this book ""Flesh and Blood: Tales of Crime"" because that would have garnered 5 stars. I found little evidence of eroticism and passion in most of the stories, and when any hint of them would arise, it was short-lived. I enjoyed the tales overall, but was mislead. I then became frustrated reading tale after tale in search of what Max Collins had promised in the introduction. The anticipation of what to expect from the introduction, was in fact, the most exciting portion of the book."
5,The book is absolutely great,"I loved this book so much, I will be reading it again. I have not laughed this much in years. The book was factual and very, very funny"
5,To Fly - VHS Tape,"Very good, the content is forever fresh, but the VHS Tape media is a little old and few have players any more. I wanted this to add to my collection. I saw the original in iMAX the first week it cam out and I liked it then and still like it. The movie is an inspirational overview of the history of flight. Received this tape in new condition in its original ""shrink wrap"" delivery was fast good seller."
1,Don't pay for style over substance!,"Monster makes good cables and often has products other people don't have, but this isn't the case here. This is a very common cable available in your choice of lengths from stereo and electronic stores. I have an iPod and a Bose home theater system and get perfect sound from the 6-foot, $6 version from Radio Shack. All you need is a stereo mini-plug on one end (plugs into the top of the iPod) and RCA red and white stereo jacks on the other (plug into the ""input"" jacks on your stereo)."
1,you probably already have one and dont realize it,"if you've bought a portable cd player recently (like last couple of years), it probably came with one of these. if you lost it/dont have one, get one somewhere else because they're not worth 30 bucks. its crazy that apple tries to sell this to you on their site bundled w/ a dock, ac adapter, another firewire cable for 80 BUCKS."
2,Sateen sheets?,"We received our sheet set and they felt like Sateen, but when we washed them they lost the Sateen feel. They feel like flannel. We are very disappointed with our purchase."
1,Don't buy it,"This set of sheets is the worst I have ever purchased. The label says: 100% Egyptian cotton made in Spain ... But you can find better quality in any store as Marshall s or TJ Maxx for the same price. They are not like any 400 t-count or egyptian cotton I have ever seen; they are rougher than 100 t-count, they do not feel like cotton. Terrible quality! Don't buy it !"
3,Good while it lasts,"It's a fun game to play, but it's very short (I finished in less than 8 hours). That seems too quick for a full-priced game, especially since there's not much in the way of replayability.However, the game itself and the backstory are great. There were many laugh-out-loud moments, and the ending was hilarious."
3,"Fun, but horrible camera","This is a very fun game. Especially if you're a fan of the show.The only real problem I had with it was the stupid camera, which was constantly wandering into awkward positions forcing me to manually re-center it. (by pressing the left trigger) On occasion it would even get stuck in such a way that the manual center function wouldn't work. Then I would have to jump around, or turn in a circle to get it to center correctly. On occasion the awkward camera angles would even cause me to die :(Other then that the voices are cool, the story plays out just like an episode of the show and the graphics are well done for a game of this type.Final verdict.... If they would have just spent a little more time working out the kinks with the camera it would have been perfect. As it is now it's fun, but very frustrating at times.Dan"
5,An absolute must for your BOB stroller,Works great. So far every water bottle and travel mug I've tried fits great. My diaper bag still has room too.
3,Good but not perfect...,"This item is meant for water bottles. You can barely get a can of coke in there or anything else. The ""holsters"" are really slim and are not steady as the item is simply a piece of fabric with velcro wraps at the ends. It is fine and will work for bottles of water but it would be nice to have a more versatile and stable drink holder. In addition it would be nice to have a holder for hot beverages as this drink holder can not accommodate a cup of starbucks or dunkin, more importantly the cup holder is so close to the baby that if you spill something the child will get wet so hot beverages are definitely a no go but even a cold drink could spill on the child due to the proximity of the cup holder and the seat. Final answer: get it if you intend to run and want to put a water bottle in it otherwise do not bother."
2,not much of a reference book,Pretty limited info. Very little theory. Shows them building a few kits.
3,Fun to read!,"I loved the Sweet Valley Twins series in elementary school. The books were always so fun to read. This story is quite an interesting one that the author needs to do carefully. In the story, Jessica Wakefield believes her mother is seeing another man. She begins doing ""undercover sleuthing"" to follow her mother's whereabouts, and find out more about the man. She and Elizabeth go through a series of crazy sleuthing stunts, only to be embarrassed that no relationship had being going on at all. It's fun to read, although rather unrealistic. The series is great, and this book, as always, is fun to read!"
3,Unrated version.....,"It's ok because finally they release the dvd after all these years...............but it's the unrated version! Many of the best scenes were cut so you miss a lot.........(Ex: Banana scene, you know what i'm talking about). I'm dissapointed for this"
3,So-so,"I'm a fan of Jennifer Rush, have five of her CDs. Sorry to say, this is the worst of the bunch. The first track is excellent, as good as they come, but the rest of this CD is just so-so. If you're unfamiliar with Jennifer Rush and just want to try her out, get one of her other CDs instead. ""Heart Over Mind"", ""Passion"", and either of her self-titled CDs are all far better than this one."
5,Epson 4490 Scanner,"I needed something that worked with Windows 7 and I had good experience with Epson scanners. Epson scanners can be online and functioning in 5 minutes, unlike some of their prominent competitors. The scan quality is very good, too. Although a little pricey, this scanner meets my needs well."
3,the shift of rage,"the tides begin to shift drastically for the fall after numerous personnel changes, a practice that's as true today as it was then.everything on this compilation points towards the greatness that mark e smith and his crew were about to plunge into. while there are some great songs and wonderful moments on this disc, as there are with even the most jumbled fall releases, i'd have to say that this collection is best as a looking back point for the faithful, as opposed to a primer for the uninitiated, as it seems to have been originally intended.new to the band? check out the latest and greatest lo-fi-hi-concept cd that can't land a stateside release, ""areyouaremissingwinner?"", or the already classics, ""the infotainment scan"", ""code-selfish"", ""shift-work"", ""the frenz experiment"", or even the grand 2000 release, ""the unutterable""."
1,Not as Shown,Image is not the cover we received and needed. Color was correct. The product seemed to be good quality. Very disappointed it was not what we thought it was. Still shopping for a cover to fit a board as shown.Poor Marketing!
1,this sucks,"all i've got to say is that if someone tells you that you should read this book because it is an amazing and you can't put it down once you start reading it, you should punch them in the gut for lying to you. the only reason i didn't put it down is because i fell asleep with it in my hand after five minutes. so to quickly summarize: THIS BOOK SUCKS!!!"
3,Good intentions but didn't pull through,"I was kinda hoping that this movie would be a new rendition of Office Space, the movie that let us all feel like we could be comfortable hating our jobs. And Visioneers almost did it. But the main character here seems to be the red Swingline stapler guy from Office Space. One who has been beaten down and oppressed to the point where there is no turning back from ending it all. Yeah, it feels that depressing. If you want a depressing movie about a guy who has a crappy job in a crappy world, then this is the movie for you. If you don't like a buzzer going off every single minute telling you how much longer until the weekend, I don't recommend this movie.No, I haven't finished watching this movie yet, and I'm not sure that I'm going to. Maybe I'll just let it play in the background while I write a few more Amazon reviews."
2,Disappointed,"The board is sturdy, no rocking, good surface. I purchased this board because I liked the cord-minder feature. However, it broke during the first use. It will either stand upright or it stays flopped down on the board. In other words it is useless. If not for that I would have given the board a 5 star."
1,:(,"Not altogether interesting. Not altogether illuminating of the human condition. Even as a companion piece to Jane Eyre, not altogether necessary.I didn't particularly care for the tone of the language, the narrative voice, or the subject matter. This novel just wasn't my bag. (Neither was Jane Eyre.)"
4,Completely changes the way you see Jane Eyre,"This short story was fabulous. But the background of it is even more fascinating. Jean Rhys grew up as a white woman in the Caribbean and went to study in England when she was 17. Even though she never returned for more than a few weeks, she always considered herself to be a white Creole and resented the English. She read Jane Eyre and felt that she related less to Jane and more to the minor character of Bertha. (I won't ruin it for anyone who hasn't read Jane Eyre.) So she wrote a beautiful story with Bertha as the main character. It's meaningful and interesting, and talks about zombies! (Although the voudou kind, not the contagious rage-filled monkeys kind)"
2,"Item returned for refund. Manufacturing defect, not seller problem.","Seller shipped on time, product was just defective from the manufacturer. Prompt refund through Amazon. Very good return procedures."
3,Bird calls too soft!,I read other's reviews on this clock before I decided to get it for a Christmas gift. They were right! The clock is very attractive and so far works well. Major drawback-- Can barely hear the very pleasant bird calls! Someone needs to go back and improve this thing. Why not add a volume control? Very disappointed that my mother is unable to hear the lovely songs. Whoever designed this clock was a moron.
3,Too quiet,"Sound quality of bird songs is fine, clear, doesn't sound fake, but they are so QUIET you have to stand under the clock to hear it. If the clock is on the other side of the living room, it is just a little squeak or a little chirp. The photocell is GREAT, I wish they had done a volume wheel on the back of the clock as well. I gave up visual style AND gave up having functional numbers on the clock face because I wanted BIRD NOISES. This... not so much."
5,SingingBirdMan,"Love this clock! Really appreciate the photo sensitive cell for controlling volume. By controlling the light level, the sound level is also controlled. I have a feeling that the reason why so many people complain about low volume is because of Low Light Level. ""Lighten Up"" Folks! Then you'll be able to listen up much better.Audubon Singing Bird Clock - 13"" Green"
1,Impossible to set correctly,"This is actually a pretty cool clock. But, unless you already know all these bird songs by ear, it is impossible to set it so the correct song plays with the correct bird. Truly frustrating."
3,Songs Not Loud Enough,"We have a very similar clock and the bird songs were loud enough to hear around the house, we purchased this clock for my mother-in-law and it is about 20% of the volume. You can only hear it in the immediate vicinity."
1,Don't waste your money,"This item seemed like the answer to my prayers. Holds 18 pr of shoes in one foot of floor space? Well, I only had it for a few months when one of the tiers snapped off, then another, and now, they are all broken in one area or another & the 3 tiers are hanging at crazy angles. And trust me, I did not misuse this shoe tree in any way. It was used for only about 6 pair of regular shoes and sandals at any one time. There's no way it could have held 18 & even lasted as long as it did. So, looks can be deceiving. This product may appear good online, but it does not do what it is supposed to do & is just not worth it."
2,Misleading description,"I thought that this is a solar battery charger, but no... You have to purchase a different component before you can charge batteries with sunlight. I found that to be quite misleading."
1,Need Solar panel,Read description carefully. Its only solar powered if you buy an extra accesory. If you call it a solar charger it should do just that without buying something else.
1,It doesnt include solar charger,This is sold as a solar charger but you need to purchase a seperate unit to make that happen. I will return it just because I hate being misled...
4,Kirby would be proud,"In ""Monster Fashion,"" Jarret Keene binds a variety of forms and moods together through his love for pop culture--good pop culture, mind you: comic books, horror movies, femme fatales, ventriloquist dummies--and does so without the self-conscious need to be hip that mars other works using the same subject matter. ""Black Revolver,"" ""Writing Against God,"" ""Ventrilquism Made Easy"" and ""So Loved the World"" are high points, and the entire first section works well as a piece. He gets a bit too cute in a few poems, but for a young poet this a remarkably strong collection, certainly far superior to anything Rita Dove had done in the last ten years, and she got to be Laureate. Robert Pinsky would probably sneer at titles like ""Ava Gardner, Queen of Earthquakes,"" and that alone is reason to buy the book. ""Monster Fashion"" is well worth the price, and Keene a poet to keep an eye on."
2,A very messed up movie.,"This film might have worked if the budget was larger than a teenagers allowance. The ingredients for this movie stew include cyborgs, voodoo, political assasination and human sacrifice; all languidly mixed together and under-cooked.I got about halfway through this grainy-filmed opus before I fell asleep. Do yourself a favor and skip this movie."
2,Art Deco Book Review,"I was disappointed to find that there were no color suggestions for any of the designs in the book. Also, the presentation of the drawings made the book look like a children's coloring book. Several of the designs would make nice stained glass projects despite the presentation."
1,It never worked!,"I wish we knew, the game does not work period. We took it to the different game business to get it cleaned and they said it did not work. Upset kid, last time we buy used games from online. Lesson learn. Now that works!"
3,read it first,"I bought this guide hoping to get good information on new cars and electronics. The car guide was ok. It gave enough information to help if you are looking for a new or used car.However, the electronics information was stitled. First, pages 240-260 were not there. There were duplicate 261-280 pages....so buyer beware. Most of the buyers advice given was general at best. My biggest dissapointment was lack of information on any portable electronics. Not a thing. With technology advancements and a huge market for portable entertainment consumer reports bit the dirt with this book.Their website was no better.I'll stick with amazon for product review...definetely cheaper."
2,Iron board holder,Sorry I have the wrong kind of ironing board for this. The picture makes it look like it will stay but it doesn't.
5,Excellent product,This product is sturdy and easy to use. It holds the ironing board and iron without any problems. Excellent
5,Exceptional!,This product is fantastic! The conversations are well presented and the wait time for responses is adequate; the booklet that accompanies the C/D's is very helpful.
3,Not very universal,"If you are thinking about getting these with the Onkyo system package deal, don't bother. The Onkyo speakers have a small threaded brass hole on the back of them just like every other satellite speaker I've ever seen.But these mounts don't have anything (at least that I could figure out) that would ""universally"" attach to that threaded hole. I wasn't about to drill into a perfectly good speaker box to attach a mounting plate when the speaker already has a mounting method (it just didn't include any). Besides, the Onkyo speakers I was going to mount are plastic and from my experience, trying to attach something to this plastic is just asking for trouble later. The plastic is too thin and eventually due to the soundwaves and vibration, it will work itself loose.These would probably be great for speakers that have a wood back or no other method for mounting."
3,Item as described,"Item was as described and arrived on time. These should not be used for heavy speakers, but are good for the newer smaller speakers."
2,A poor effort from greatness.,"Ian Brown was the frontman of the Stone Roses before heading solo. This album confirms that he made a poor decision. The album only has three decent tracks. My Star, Can't See Me, and Corpses In Her Mouth. A less than stellar effort from someone who is potentially excellent. The album in itself implies a lack of effort. Unfinished Monkey Business. Unfinished it is, I wonder how it would have sounded if it was finished?"
2,this game simply.........SUCKS!,okay i am a huge buffy fan and a xbox fan I loved the first game and i still play it even if it is very very old now when this game came out i was excited but then when i popped this in the xbox and played the first level......i knew i had to return itTHE END
1,buffy the vampire slayers,will not work on xbox 360 even though we upgraded the fix and it says that it will work on the xbox 360
2,kinda lame,The camera angles are problematic. It's too long between opportunities to save. Sometimes items you need to pick up are impossible to see unless you are right on top of them. The quips get very repetitive very fast. The plot isn't horrible and the fighting can be fun when the controls work and you can see your opponent. There are also extras like cast interviews that are cool.I agree with the reviewer who said buy it on sale.
3,confused?,"I don't consider myself a critic but this needs to be said. A good band is defined by several things; album sales is not one of them. A great band is defined only through the course of time. A mediocre band is ...well, I think you get the picture. Whenever cleavage becomes a clever way to sell something, be wary of the product."
2,Don't exect to put ANYTHING other than MD player in there...,"There is plenty of room for my MD player, but that is IT (OK, maybe ONE minidisc, but it's gonna be tight). My MD player has a remote and I can't get the case to zip with the remote attached, so the case is pretty useless. It really does me no good to have to take everything apart and store it all in different cases. And forget about carrying your headphones in the case unless you use teeny-tiny earbuds. If this is ""mid-sized"" case, I'd hate to see the small one."
5,It works,"I got this to use with my Sony MZ-N505. I works ok, but it doesn't fit exactly the way I would like it to. When I put the player in, I have to put it upside down in order to get the headphone cord to go the right way. When the player is upside down, you can't read the screen because the mesh that holds the player in is in the way. Other players probably don't have this problem though. I was able to get a remote for my player (sony rm-mc11el), so I no longer have a problem with the case. It does provide good padding and room for 1 or 2 extra minidisks. The arm band works good and the velcro is very strong. Hopefully, Sony will come out with a custom case, but I doubt it."
2,NOT SO GOOD,"I love the actual Potette Portable Potty I have one in red and my daughter absolutly loves it. It has been great on the go but, the Potty re-fills barely fit and the little pads in them don't give off much sent..For the price I wouldn't recoment them you pay $5 plus shipping for 10 and they are hard to find. I use generic plastic bags with sented pant libers I get 50 for less then the price of one re-fil. You do the math. Don't think the the seats are bad because they are not they work great you just have to make the choice on the bags..Try a regular plastic bag and see how it works. Good luck!"
5,review the best story book ever,"""Uncle Wiggily"" is the book that my son chose over and over again to read at bedtime. It captivates young minds with its imagination, teaches young hearts valuable lessons of understanding and honesty, and encourages reading nightly with its vivid animal characters and interesting tales. This was the most often read book for bedtime in our home, bar none. Your young readers will love it. You will, too!!!!!"
4,nancy drew,"Not my children's favourite book,but okay.We bought it as part of our Sonlight homeschool curriculum P4/5 for our soon to be 4 year old daughter.She is not particuarly fond of this book so I read it to her at bedtime together with my 3 youngest children all under 10 who quite enjoy it.The book itself is an attractive hardback,so no complaints there."
3,It's ok.,I liked a few of the ideas in this book very much. Mostly though the ideas seemed very simple and designed for a younger crowd. I guess I was just looking for something a bit different.
3,Save the Thoroughbred Series!,"The Cindy and second generation eventing portions of the series were dark days for Thoroughbred. The plots have since switched back to racing and the newest few books have been exceptional. Just as we thought there was hope for the Thoroughbred series to be restored to its former glory Harper Collins has decided to end the series abruptly after #72. With such a dedicated following and online fan base with members from all over the world, this is a classic and beloved series that has inspired many people and provided horse fans with vicarious thrills and adventure. Ashleigh saved Wonder, now it's up to you to help save Thoroughbred. [...]"
3,Huh?,"Okay. Christina gets a valuable racehorse for her birthday. He's the last foal of Ashleigh's Wonder. But is he good enough for Christina? Nope, she has to have Sterling Dream. And as much as I like Christina, she's like a different character in this book. But Christina rocks in the later books when she starts racing. I just wish that she always loved racing so she wouldn't have traded Legacy. But I must admit. I know what it's like to want something so bad that you won't stop at anything until you get it. But you don't need to act so selfish to get it. Just work hard to save up for it and don't complain. But anyway, if you are interested in finding out where Sterling Dream came from, then you should read this book."
3,"I liked the book, but what happened to the past 10 years?","Okay, so the book was pretty good. I liked the story line and everything. But where are the ten years we missed?! Hello! ' Bye Samantha, 'bye, Cindy! They don't even mention Cindy's name! It's like she never existed! And Samantha was thrown to Ireland with Tor! And whatever happened to that baby Ashleigh was expecting? Was it a miscarriage or a stillborn baby? And if so, WHY DIDN'T THEY TELL US? Oh, and didn't Wonder have any other colts or fillies between Campion and Legacy? And Honor! What happened to her? So she won her maiden. What's after that?! In other words, how did ten years fly by so fast? What a rip-off!"
3,What happen to Cindy?,I really like the books that Cindy is in. when I read #24 there was no Cindy! There was only one time that Cindy was mentioned after #23. I wish Cindy would come back!
1,THE WORST!!!!!,"This is the worst Thoroughbred book yet!!!!!!! I was getting tired of Cindy, but they didn't have to skip 10 years to get a new charactor. If the series has to be on jumping, they could have used Mandy. Now Mandy has fallen of the face of the earth along with Sammy, Tor, Max, Pride, Honor, Jazzman, Champion, Sierra, and alll the others favorites. Also, how could Christina trade Legacy if the Townsends half owned him???? Where are the townsends??? I guess they fell of the earth, too. Actually, almost all of the Horses and people from the Thoroughbred series are gone. Oh Yea- whoever suggested that they should make a special called Everything that was never followed up in the Thoroughbred series, I think that is a Great idea!!! It would be the longest book in history!!!!!"
3,What happened?,"I don't think that this book was quite as bad as everyone said. The main things that I disliked, were that it had nothing to do with racing, it was not as well written as the other ones and I don't understand where everyone went including the baby Ashleigh was supposed to have. Also, in all but about two cases, Ashleigh came off seeming like a workaholic, uncaring mother when I know she is not."
3,What the heck?!?!?!?!,"What happened????Ok, the book in itself wasn't incredibly bad (just plain bad),and it totally changed the series! Where are the Townsends? Where is Cindy? Why did Sammy and Tor move over seas? Sure, eventing is a nice twist, but the series was about racing and they never mention it anymore!!! What happened to Wonder, Pride, Princess, Glory, Shining, Fleet Goddess, Honor,etc??? Christina has some sort of attitude problem. She just up and traded Legacy for a claimer that may not even take to jumping, even if she jumped the fence with good form.What gives? I hear Joanna is taking over again, so maybe she get this series back the way it used to be, because I liked it much better that way."
3,Thoroughbred Series Turning for the worst??,By the sounds of it this series is turning out for the worst. I have read every single thoroughbred book that has come out where I live. Right up until #22 and Samantha's Journey(super edition)I wanted to know more about Ashleigh and Cindy obviously I want to know about all the old horses what has happened.I mean this series was great you hardly find any fiction books about racing I mean lots of books are about Show jumping. I am really dissapointed.I have collected every single one. I guess I still will anyway.
1,What happened?,Ok so what happened? Where's Ashleigh's baby? Where's Cindy? Where's all the other horses? what happened to Glory? It's like someone wrote this book without even reading any of the other books. What happened to the Townsends? there is NO way they'd A) let Ashleigh give Christina Legacy! and B) there is ABSOLUTELY NO way they'd let Christina GIVE him away!! They have a half interest in this horse so how can they just give him away. Samantha took off to Ireland?!?!!? what? how? when? is she still with Tor?? what happened. If your going to write a book in a series make sure you read the rest of the books in the series before hand. I kept on checking to make sure i hadn't missed a book in the series because i was so confused!
1,It Stunk,"I think that this was one of the worst books I've ever read. For one thing, where is Cindy?, her name was never mentioned once. And in book #23 the only reason why Ashleigh couldn't ride Honor, was because she was having another baby, what happened to that? And who in their right mind would give up the son of a famous racehorse? I mean, Ashleigh had to fight just too keep Wonder's foals at Whitebrook and she just lets her daughter give Legacy up (the word stupid comes to mind.) Christina is just a selfish little brat who expects her own way. She should be so lucky to own a horse, or even live on a horse farm. I think that Joanna Campbell should come back!"
1,Awful,"When I see the word Thoroughbred, I usually think of RACING. NOT 3-DAY EVENTING! I already wrote a review on this book, but I don't care. I hope the author of this book will read it. What happened to Ashleigh? She's an old person now, and that's stupid. And WONDER. She's not gonna have foals anymore? Now THAT'S stupid! This book skipped too many years. And Sammy moved to Ireland. Why'd she do that? I can't wait for the series about Ashleigh to come out. But I still want Thoroughbred. It's ruined now, though. Ms. Campbell, you're letting Allison Estes take over TB!! PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE come back!"
2,Tell me something I don't know already,"I bought this book based on reviews on the site, but I was very disappointed with the book. It had a definite ""propagandist"" feel to it (putting the hard sell on one specific approach to surgery)and a good part of the data included is out of date, especially when regarding gastric banding. There was a LOT of opinion too, based on her own experience, without a lot of backing data.The data that was close to being up to date has been covered in many other places before I got to this.If you are just beginning your journey and are considering the RNY approach, this might be useful to you, but I'd suggest saving your money and doing your own research online. You can find most if not all of this in a few hours."
4,Very informative,"Although it is a bit outdated, it is very informative and worth getting. Some of the surgeries are being phased out soon, but th majority of the information is right on and very good. The book was sent in record time and was in as good or better shape than I expected! I would recommend buying from them again!"
5,It's Great!,I find that I no longer iron over the cord because it's up and out of the way. Love and would buy it again.
2,Not strong enough to hold the cord for my iron,Not strong enough! I use it but it regularly falls over. If your iron has heavy duty cord don't buy this
3,"Trying a do-over - ok looks good, lot of plastic but.....","The first one had broken clip so ordered replacement. It seems to be what I need but I sure wish everything wasn't made of so much plastic these days!! The top clip for cord is not real easy to get cord into and the plastic doesn't appear very strong but we will see. The screw clamp is also plastic and doesn't screw onto ironing board very tight. FYI pkg says it turns in all directions but what they mean is it can be put into any direction but it only turns in the direction of the arrow (not easy to see). It is kinda hard to turn at first you must pull it out but it gets easier.It does the trick once it's setup and for the price probably worth it.Ok replacement seems to be fine - the product is a lot of plastic but guess there isn't any all metal option. Well, no option I can afford that is :)"
4,Great for home use,"it is sturdy, rolls easy, and holds a large number of shirts. Great for the laundry room, or great for the seamstress. For home use, it is very useful."
4,This book is ok.,If your new to open gl and know your C and arent up all night and awake. The book doesnt get bogged down and treads lightly on most topics. I hate books that write too much on topics that you just want to work and move on. At my uni this book is constantly on loan and then it went missing. So i bought it. As with most things. One book is never enough.
1,Costs way too much for the content,"I am just starting to develop games. While I have learned about game programming through this book, it never gave me any solid info to wrap my brain around. The book writting does not flow. The prose is way too ""touchy-feely."" If you are looking for a book that gives a direct treatment of the material, do not buy this book. It tries to cover too much material with too little space. And it does so at the expense of content. The section on math should be removed as should the section on windows programming. Neither is written very well and that content can be found in abundance from other sources. Plus some the code does not work correctly (this in my opinion is a very poor reflection on the author/publisher.) On top of it all the book is fairly pricy. Overall this book has been a disappointment."
1,Crappy book,"The book is crap. Many of their examples wont even compile (because the code has errors) but somehow they managed to give you .exe files but those just crash because the code is wrong (I have no idea how they managed to compile this crap). Their coding style sucks especially when they try and give you OO (object oriented) examples. If you want to learn OpenGL I would recommend ""OpenGL Programming Guide"".I found absolutely nothing usefull in this book.It's hard to explain how bad this book sucks so I'll put it this way: I have purchase 40+ programming type books from amazon.com (and read them) and this is the only book I've reviwed because I thought it needed to be known how crappy this book is."
4,good foundation to start,"I am pleased with the book overall. This has got me started into Opengl.Coding in the book is clear but lacks in the department of error dection(a trade off for readability i guess).Some of his code may crash if your hardware does not fully support some open gl extentions.This can be very frustration when trying to debug/learn when no error messages pop up telling you that a specific extention was not supported.The book i felt could have had a bit more content however for a getting start book i think it worked out well for me and is a good reference.If you are someone seriously looking into opengl game programming, this is a good place to start."
2,"""Windows openGL game programming for dummies""","This would have been a better name for this book. Direct X, Direct input, Direct audio, Direct music is not what i expected to find in an openGL book. This book is heavily windows oriented. Moreover, in all areas, all the stuffs explained are very simple stuffs, on which you can easily find information on the web, if you didn't know them already. Nothing interesting if you have already used openGL. I've been really disapointed by this book."
4,review of The Last Time,"I bought this because of Amber Valletta's nude scenes. They're OK, but not worth five stars. I didn't really believe the ending, or at least Amber's ending. I can't really say too much without revealing the plot, but Brendon Fraser broke type-cast by the end, and I doubt if anyone would take the trouble to set in motion such a complicated plot, but I enjoyed it anyway."
2,Do not buy this.,"not recommended to buy this, this polder shakes whne ironing. tried all ways to fix it no luck. Thinking this is what we get for this price."
2,Not what I was hoping for,"Based on the previous review I thought I was in for a real treat. Sorry to say this album was about as bland as I've heard. Yes the children's voices are wonderful, but all the songs are slow, kinda sappy and sound alike. The songs from Lilo & Stich were incredible but now it appears that's more due to Mark Keali'i Ho'omalu wonderful song and lyric writing ability. What a creative person he must be (along with his original hula style). If you really liked the music from Lilo & Stich maybe the'll pair Mark up with the choir again for the Sequel!!!!"
3,"Brun's Book, Full of Talky Politics","You'll be lost if you start book three without the background of book two,Sporting Chance. This story follows Brun and the other rich brats from 'Hunting Party' as they gain independence and maturity. On the other plot thread are Captain Serrano and Lady Cecelia chasing down the baddies with the yacht.Nothing in the book really stood out, not the plot, the 'sci-fi', or characters, but it does bring the 'Captain Serrano' arc into a conclusion. The political wrangling got tedious, but it ended well. Pages 250-350 were hard to get through. An easily forgettable book, target audience more towards teenage/young girls."
1,Awful book,"This is quite possibly the worst text book that I have ever used. I am a student at RIT the college at which Budynas teaches, hence we use this book. This book is not very clear at all. It uses equations in examples and never references where they come from. It doesn't explain how to do hardly anything worth a darn. In a few of the chapters it references tables and charts that don't exist. The tables in the back of the book are half-way done and dont give all the necessary information. I do not like this book one bit and hope that it will be edited many times over because there where many things missed in editing this time around"
1,keep the box to return it.,"pros:easy to returncons:does not power computer, does not charge, does not fit bay exactly (slightly forced), computer went black on second attempt (no apparent damage), waste of time searching, evaluating, waiting for ship, testing, returning, starting over."
4,A different look on life! Excellent!!,"This book is very informative on Wal-Mart and in politics! As a dollar circulates, the tax will generate more than a dollar in tax revenue and the surplus goes to Wal-Mart to make the economy look good.An excellent, entertaining read!"
1,Drying rack,"This is the second chrome drying rack I've bought from Amazon and neither of them have stood up to any of the qualifications we usually have for ""metal."" I bought this hoping it would be unusually sturdy (enough to support a full load of laundry and a cat, since she often decides to jump on my drying rack) and it acquired a permanent slouch on one side within a few uses and had to be proped up or stood unacceptably uneven until I gave it away. This is probably an acceptable product if you are planning on hanging a few shirts or a towel--it's attractive and can hold a small amount--but if you think metal is going to hold more than ten pounds or so with any grace, look elsewhere--probably somewhere other than Amazon."
2,small,"It was really, really small and the color on the site had a variety to colors in it. Once I received them, they were just plain lavender looking. The picture on the site is very deceiving. Usually, most items are but this one was really bad!!"
1,This book is about as bad as it gets.,"I had to read this book for eighth grade, and found myself struggling to read it. It's not that the plot moved too slow, its just that there was no plot to speak of. I think I speak for my entire grade when I say no one liked it. It's more and more of the same useless words. Teachers: Teach more meaningful books, ie Dickens, Tolkein, Chaucer, etc., not Shabanu."
5,I can't believe I found it again,"I read this book ten years ago, when I was in the fifth grade. I don't know why I thought about it tonight, but for some reason everything, except the title, swept into my mind and I had to find it again. This is the sort of book that children should be reading, if for no other reason than that the instant I thought about it the images were sharp again in my mind. And I found it again easily, even remembering what prize it had won. This is a book that can inspire the imagination of a child, and still bring about a smile in the memory of an adult."
2,A Pretty Good Book but Not the Best,"JGMSP2S24 The book Shabanu is not the best book that I have ever read. The book is about a girl who lives in the desert. Most of the book is about her daily life and her customs. I don't really recommend this book but if you are interested in young desert girl's daily lives, I think that you should read this book if that is your interest. But young readers, I do not recommend this book for you."
2,Too Dark,"It starts out good. but the ending is very, very, dark.She's in a family that doesn't love her at all.It is inappropriate for people under 15"
5,Don't judge this book by it's cover!,"Have you ever heard the saying don't judge a book by its cover? Well you shouldn't do that with the book Shabanu, Daughter of the Wind. This book isn't choppy or rugged. It's smooth and thick. It seems like you are the characters instead of just reading about them. This book also gives you a little taste of culture and reality in other countries. So if you to ever get the chance to read this book you'll be taking a trip that you'll never want forget!"
3,"Good, interesting","I am 11 years old and my uncle gave me ths book for my birthday. I am from Pakistan, so that is why the book interested me. I also spoked the language that Shabanu speaked, and I noticed that some things about the language was wrong. For instance, for the word DAD, the author used Dadi, and that means grandmother on the father's side. Also, it said that choti meant monkey, when it really means small, and that bundr means small, when it really means monkey. Please correct these words in the following editions if possible. I think that it is really nice that an somebody finally wrote about Pakistanand it's interesting culture."
1,THIS IS HORRIBLE,I've read some bad books in my life but this one takes the trophy. I was unwillingly forced to read this book by my english teacher. I hated this book so much I almost couldn't read it. This book isn't worth the lint in my pocket $5.99 what a joke. this book seems like it was written by someone that never has fun and doesnt like seeing other people having fun either. this book drives me insane. I am not usually a negative person but reading this book has made me be one on occasion. Nothing good ever happens to Shabanu. Shabanu seems like a good charecter.but they ruined her in the book. If the newberry award is for bad books I see why this book got it. DO NOT GET THIS BOOK IT IS HORRIBLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5,The importance of change and saving,The value of coin is overlooked in some parts of the world but with the right attitude and ambition change can become very useful and keep our wallets full.
4,Naruto frog,"I bought this for my best friend and she loved it!Not only is it from one of her favorite anime series but its a frog, and he favorite animal is a frog."
1,LIES! LIES! ALL LIES!,"This ring is NOT solid silver. I took it to the jewelers to get sized for my husband. The guy couldnt't do it, because its hollow inside. I ordered a size 10, and they sent me a size 9. just avoid this seller if you can."
2,Hmmm...I Don't Get why everyone likes this book.,"I read this book about a year ago and just stumbled across the listing for it and was amazed at seeing 4 or 5 stars for all the reviews. This book was completely misleading. If you are looking for an exciting, fast paced werewolf TAIL (I had to write it that way!) this is NOT the book for you. This book dealt more with a woman's internal conflicts as she deals with her love life and having to change under the full moon. I was bored out of my mind through the whole book. There was nothing even remotely interesting in this book! I didn't even find the romance sections interesting or sexy. If you want a good werewolf novel think twice before buying this book...Try something like Donna Boyd's THE PASSION. This book was just bad."
3,Long & Dark,"Even being Underworld is my favorite band this CD is extremely rare and I have finally attained it after so many years... I expected it to be better, yet the reason why is the best track ""Dark train"" I have already heard on the ""born slippy"" single... It is still a great techno single but if you already own ""dubnobasswithmyheadman"" and ""Born slippy"" the CD is only valueable to fulfill an Underworld collection... I feel bad not giving this a greater review, but as someone who owns every single Underworld bit of music, I do not recommend going out of your way for this one... Still good, but could have been better..."
4,Fairy lover's dream,This is challenging enough for even the most skilled gamer but is not too hard to learn even for beginners. I highly recommend this game. The scenes are beautifully done and the game play is great.
3,slow play,Beautiful graphics but takes FOREVER to load fight scenes when using XP.I still haven't finished the game because I don't have the time to wait to load the game and deal with the fight loads.
5,It's the sort of book you don't lend anybody,"The writing is pure seduction, whimsical, enchanting, all those words which mean totally freaking dreamy. The problem is, for me at least, that it's the sort of book that I can't read straight through. It might take me a few weeks or a year. Probably because there isn't a plot to speak of. Anyway, expect poetry, get poetry. And don't let go of your copy because it'll never come back. Mine didn't."
5,Italo Calvino's Absolute Masterpiece,"He wrote so many books, and most of them are good, some of the very good. But probably this is his real masterpiece, and the number of enthusiastic comments here should be proof of this. It is highly ironic that Calvino was busy writing his Citta' invisibili, that is, his invisible cities while Italians were busy spoiling their towns and cities--but that's the way history goes. This is the great modernist book for all those who have been scared by Ulysses; readable, crystal-clear and endlessly rich, witty, tender sometime. And with a great ending (it HAS and ending, after all)--which sounds terribly bitter to Italian ears. But English-reading people will be fascinated by its mythical echoes and hints.Besides, this is the best book to start with if you never read anything written by this great Italian writer. You can read the rest later (and you won't be disappointed), but this is THE Introduction to Calvino's multiple narrative worlds. Enjoy!"
4,Beautifully scattered,"The imagery, as typical with Calvino, is vivid, otherworldly, and compelling. The book feels like a series of ideas, each sharply and succinctly illustrated.He only problem is that the chapters feel like they could have appeared in any order, and that there was no underlying story arc. This made the end of the book feel extremely sudden and unexpected. Small flaw."
3,Interesting dialogues between Polo and Kublai Khan,"Frequently overrated, this book has to be read as a kind of delirium by a prolific author.A bit boring but with some interesting pieces."
2,"A cotton-candy distraction, not a novel.","I'm open to new forms of writing, but this book simply failed to hold my interest. Without any claim to reality or even well-defined characters, it dissolves into a series of poetic tableaux. Keep it in the bathroom, maybe."
1,huh?,"This and Kahlil Gibran's ""The Prophet"" are the only two books I've ever read that I can honestly say I didn't understand one single word."
5,Really delicious but expensive,Really delicious but expensive. I think that 16 dollars its too much.Buy I accept that the flavor is really good.
4,Great for baking pumpkin recipes,"When I first got this product, I put it in my coffee attempting to make my own version of a pumpkin spice latte but I didn't like it. Then a few months later I decided to experiment with some pumpkin protein muffins and other pumpkin recipes and I went through the bottle fast!! It adds the perfect flavor to pumpkin muffins, cookies, pancakes, and ice cream. Definitely will be repurchasing."
4,Ideal diorama size,My son used these pandas in a diorama he made for school. They were the perfect size for that purpose and the variety of poses added visual interest. Knocked off a star because I wish they weren't made in China!
1,Disapointing,I read this book after learning that he is Albert Einsteins favorite philosopher. I find Einstein's writing interesting and thought this would be brilliant. I was wrong. It is badly written and weak in philosophy.
1,Fraud,"They have used the Penguin cover as an intentional means to dupe customers into buying this ebook, when it is actually your standard free public domain edition with no introduction or notes. Not only do I want my money back, but I think those sellers should be banned from Amazon."
1,Kindle version is not from the Penguin Edition,"The $.99 Kindle edition offered under the Penguin cover, translator and introduction by prominant philosopher, Stuart Hampshire is NOT the Curley translation, and it does not have the Hampshire introduction or Curley annotations. It is the Elwes translation. However, it is not the same edition of the Elwes translation offered for free a few editions down. It has a short biography of Spinoza which the free edition does not have. It also has a more complete Table of Contents. I suspect this is not the first time Amazon has exploited such ambiguities in marketing Kindle editions. The fact that it costs but a dollar is a small compensation. Whether this is outright fraud, you would need a lawyer to tell. It is certainly misleading."
1,Very disappointing,"Could not drag myself further than to page 70 - what a disappointment. His style of writing in this book is incredibly poor, it felt like reading a dime novel picked up at the gas station.I loved all his previous books, but I am not sure if I will give his future books another try.Good luck that I only checked it out at the library and did not buy it."
4,Everybody can be a pilot?,"If you read this book like a thriller you will be disappointed, some parts are thrilling but not even half of the book, this is not a bad story but is not the best of Follett, nevertheless is a book that will get you a good time. This book is a story of the WWII but you will not know to much about that war in this book, but maybe, just maybe you will know how to flight a plane."
5,Hornet Flight,I thought that the book hornet flight was a incredibally good book and it kept me interested all the way through. I don't think that you should be any younger than 13 to read it though because it has a very complex plot that younger children may not understand.
4,Duty vs. liberty,"Another good World War II spy thriller from Follett. This time around, the story centers on a young Danish student's efforts to help England discover how the Germans are able to shoot down so many British bombers.Thematically, Follett explores the difference between a life (and a society) run according to duty, rules, and order---whether it's a Danish police detective cooperating with the occupying Nazis, or an evangelical minister destroying his son's dreams for one youthful ""sin""---and one of principle, liberty, and the individual pursuit of happiness---from listening to jazz music and riding a converted steam-powered motorcycle to get around wartime petrol rationing, to pursuing the deeper values of career, politics, and romance. Interesting and inspiring.And as usual, John Lee's narration of this audio edition is highly enjoyable."
2,Formulaic -- decent writing style but that is about it,"This is not a bad book -- it just seems pretty formulaic and uninspired to me. I saw the romance angle coming from miles away -- Follett uses variants on the same formulas for almost all of his WW2 thrillers (Eye of the Needle is the big exception--but this is the identical formula he uses in ""The Key to Rebecca"" and ""Code to Zero"" to name just two). Follett's writing style, as usual, moves right along, but this is a quick read, and not a particularly memorable one."
4,Improvement,After Jackdaws I thought Follett had lost his fastball but this was a lot better. No Eye Of The Needle but pretty good.
2,Formulaic crap from a former master,"Yeah, I read the whole thing, even gasped several times. But as the plot contrivances began to pile up, I just got depressed. The whole thing is a series of cheap coincidences, manipulative character ""development"" (oh gee, the evil policeman takes care of his invalid wife--he can't be ALL bad!) and transparent obstacles the plucky young heros must overcome. There's never any doubt what's going to happen, so you slog through all these tedious plot-delay tactics, yearning for an actual surprise.Bottom line: Creaky, crappy, and mechanical. And this from a man who wrote some of the best books of the genre. I'm beginning to suspect he's created a computer program to plot his books--he just feeds in the old storylines and clicks commands, in this case, ""Norwegianize!"""
2,Another diappointment from Kenny,"After reading Eye of the Needle and Pillars of the Earth readers have the right to expect more from this author. However, he's either just cashing in on his past success (and name recognition) or just too lazy to write up to his abilities. These characters are paper thin, no plot development, and no surprises or plot twists at all. I wish Kenny would reread Pillars and see how good he used to be before he puts out any more of this trash. The only reason I'm giving it two stars is because I actually was interested enough to want to finish it. Don't buy this book, go to your library and check it out because that's what it's worth."
2,Not Up to Standards,"Follett has written a number of wonderful books including Jackdaws. Hornet Flight like Jackdaws deals with penetration into occupied Europe, but unlike his past efforts the characters were not believable. Harald the hero and his girl friend Kathy are totally dependent on unreal coincidences to move the plot along. There were opportunities of character development especially with Kathy's and Harald's parents but instead they were made comic book, as a prior reviewer said, figures.In short I would rather invest my time in reading some wonderful prior Follett's than this effort."
3,Follet on autopilot,"Follet is a master on WWII thrillers. OK, maybe he took a vacation on this one, kind of predictable and formulaic story. If you are a hardcore fan, by all means read it. If you are new to Follet try ""Eye of the needle"" or ""The key to Rebecca"" first."
5,Follett brilliant read! Sensational Suspense!,"Highly recommend, ticks all the boxes of entertaining, thriller, great characters, excellent plot and twists. Great WW2 spy book, attention to detail of period Follett it a master at that immersing you in a time a place where you get taken along for the ride of your life! If you have deadlines or time poor I recommend delaying this book to the weekend! I stayed up to 4m to finish it. in closing excellent read buy with confidence."
3,Flat like Denmark,"I had liked very much a trip to Denmark last fall so I was looking forward to reading this book, set there. I was disappointed. It was a rehash of innumerable WW ""thrillers"" - although not very thrilling!"
3,Good Series,"I love this series, but I am not liking the size of this book. It is too big and akward to hold when reading. The only good thing about it really was the price so I will live with it. I really wanted to get these on my kindle but apparently that is never going to happen so I gave up and bought the paper back version (again). Would not reccommend this to my friends."
3,Just ok,Difficult to stay on my board. The only place it will hook on is way on the end of the board. Makes for a tired arm after having to reach over so far to get the iron each time.
1,Do you really care about my dog?,"The product itself I suspect is fine. However, it took me a month to receive! I feel the my pet's health was compromised. I contacted the Tradewinds company and though the kept promising my product would be there 'that' week it never came on time, promise after promise, week after week."

2,dip it low,"Disgusting, but catchy. The whole song is about having sex with a guy. I mean,""Dip it low, pick it up slow, roll it all around poke it out..""Disgusting."
3,what happened?,"ok i always thought that christina was sooo hottttt! now shes turned into jr. beyonce and that churns my butter hahahaha(funny saying) to see tha basically shes become jr. sl*t because thats what beyonces become and christina is following her style. i loved love dont cost a thing but now that she became that SL*TTY i dont know if i can watch it one more time w/o thinking ""what has this girl became?""!!! im givin 3 stars cause shes still my lil hottie even tho shes a lil SL*TTY"
4,Great Album-but not perfect,"This album is worth the money,...but, it's too bad that the album is too short. Just over 42 minutes long. But it has great beats and features great artists, including the underrated rap talents, Ju Ju and Psycho Les of the Beatnuts. Well worth checking out."
5,Great bow and a hoot to shoot,I purchased this bow this past fall and absolutely love shooting it. I can consistantly group 4-5 arrows in about a 2 inch circle out to 35 yards.
4,"Good Bow, mine came opened","Good light weight bow, mine came ""opened"" no manual.Being new to archery, I did not realize the Bows do not come with arrow rests? Or was it just my dumb luck? Some minor scratches. Otherwise, the bow has a good feel to it!"
2,grocery cart,"the polder shopping cart seemed to be sufficiently large and sturdy. However, the bolt holding one of the large wheels simply sheared leaving a piece lodged in the wheel shaft. I will be asking manufacturer to replace wheel."
1,large wheel broke off the second time I used it,"It was a great item before it broke...I used it twice...never put and heavy items in it...I noticed the wheel wobble a bit the first time I used it, but thought that it was ok. I took it to the Mall on Black Friday..worked wonderfully...unloaded it and went home...while it was empty and I went to put it into the garage..the bolt in the wheel broke off..(I believe it was defective, after all there was nothing in it when it broke..I was only going over the 1 inch lip on the garage)I cannot find a phone number for customer service so that I could tell them..I just wanted a replacement wheel....Also, it is too late to return the whole thing..Very bad experience with Amazon."
3,"Nasty Stuff, but it works","this stuff tastes nasty but it works, it really helps my stomach antacids. If you can bypass the flavor it will ease the burning sensation. it also soothes and coats my stomach I do not take it everyday but if I need to I can,even several times a day....it is very inexpensive for the size."
5,"almost essential...worth P.O.A. for Dicks, Bad Brains, MDC","Seriously, wanna here unbrideled passion, the likes of which has yet to be rivaled in any musical statement before or after? Listen to the Dicks Hate the Police, and feel the chills up your spine (whether you agree with their message or not). MDC plays the classic John Wayne Was a Nazi, and by God, you'll believe em!! Pay To Cum by the Bad Brains is still the best thing they've done, and the original ""fastest song ever"". Buy this! (or acquire it somehow!)"
4,Alright,"`This is an alright selection, nothing to be too excited about. I think that there are probably better Gabrieli sets to buy (Venetian Church Music, Andrew Parrott/Taverner Consort), but there are a few tunes on this CD that are well played. I strongly dislike this rendition of ""In ecclesiis,"" finding the young boys voices too untrained and faulty. An OK buy, but look around for something to really light your eyes up (or...ears)."
3,Doesn't work for my ironing board.,"I bought this because I thought it would work with any ironing board but it doesn't work with my wal-mart version. So, while the idea is nice, it doesn't do me any good!"
2,It's not what I was looking for.,The description is not accurate. The size is too small on the inside to hold my camera. I returned this product.
3,slim leather camera case,"Not a bad product-it is functional, but the design is not the most pleasing-could be nicer looking."
4,Olympus Case,"The case is very nice but bigger than i exepcted - it's bulky for the FE-190. However, it can alternatively be used as a wallet because it has several compartments, so it might be a good vacation option."
4,PRIDE is cheaper than money,"The author does acknowledge the influence of money in motivating people in the US economy. But only for self-serving pride. He says ""feelings of pride based upon self-serving or materialistic gains are short-term, transient, and risky..."" Money by itself doesn't create pride in the institution. He cites examples with The Home Depot, US Marine Corps and Southwest Airlines and how they create pride in their organizations. Read the five paths offered and a starter list for pride-building when seeking a process to instill greater institution-pride. According to the author, ""the secret to success is applying the discipline and focus required to sustain institution-building pride among those employees who make a competitive difference to you."" If you think it's all common sense to create pride, why do many organizations try to spend their way to success? Read the last page of the book first. Great story about an organization with lots of pride for 227 years [Semper Fi]."
4,Good for personal management and values,"While others may be ok with this book, I am good with it. Very good insight on personal management and values. I enjoyed the Military aspect. I recommend."
1,HARDER THAN A ROCK,iT IS WAY TO HARD AND NOT SOFT AND TOO MANY BUMPS.California Exotics Waterproof Turbo Glider Vibrator
4,great cd,"i think the new stitches cd is great.they are one of the few bands around that still make the old school punk sound,sound good.If you are into old school punk,this cd is a must have!"
1,What has the world come to?,"After learning that Soyinka received a Nobel Prize in Literature while perusing the back cover of this book at the bookstore, I was immediately interested.Unfortunately after reading this book, I was surprised that Soyinka could read a book let alone write one. Obviously there must be some sort of affirmative action on the Nobel Prize board, since this is second-rate writing from a third-rate mind.A waste of money, and more importantly, time."
5,THE book...,"...on Filipino knife fighting/defense! Very clear photos and well done instruction. Covers many instructors, ranging from major to minor influence from the Philippines. As a FMA researcher and practitioner this book has proven a great tool for learning and sharing with others. If you get only two books on Filipino Martial Arts, get this one... and Dan Inosanto's."
5,A fascinating read,"I've been reading about WW II for years. Many books get lost in the detail. Toughill's account is well documented, reads like a novel, and presents a masterful overview of the time period, why the war started, how it progressed, and why it ended the way it did. Highly recommended."
1,Ridicules as social dance overview,"This is a group of ballet and show dancers performing their ""witty"" impression of social dance. I didn't see a single dancer being social with their partner(s). Then again, I could not stand to watch the whole DVD. The production is a dated VHS transferred to DVD (i would rather say 1988 then 1998). And those annoying narratives..."
3,Great live 15th but 27 is a real bomb,"Two live performances here by a legendary Russian pianist. The charming 15th concerto receives a wonderfully witty performance but the 27th is flatter than a pancake. Richter was a great pianist, no argument there. But everybody has their off nights and in 27 Richter was way off. I was lucky. I bought the CD for 15 and have enjoyed it many times. But one listening of 27 was more than enough."
1,Haven't used it yet,"I purchased this product for my husbands birthday July 22. Unfortunatly, it didn't work. We sent it in they replaced the circuit board and sent it back to us. Still didn't work. We have, now a second time, sent it back and asked for a new one. Don't know how well the detector works as it hasn't since purchased!"
4,"A great book for the lazy golfer, who needs to work at golf.","In Curt Sampson's biography of Ben Hogan, he tells the true story of a young caddie who becomes the world's best golfer. Curt Sampson seems to be telling the reader that through hard work you can achieve your goal. Mr. Sampson wrote this book to show the good, bad, and the ugly sides of Ben Hogan's life. Curt Sampson is right on with his characterization of Hogan. Hogan is tough as nails and this is truly portrayed throughout the book. This book could help the average golfer, learn how to work at their game ""until his hands bled."" HOGAN will always be of great importance to the reader, because it shows the trials and tribulations of the poor boy who makes it big. Anyone who wants to see a person who earned their living and survived through the tough times, should read HOGAN by Curt Sampson."
3,Over Priced,"The planter looks good, but now that I have it in hand and can see the construction, its a little flimsy. I wouldn't spend $60 again for this planter. $30 yes. $40 maybe."
4,Polder Ironing Board Cover,"Great fit on the unusually large ironing board I have. However, the fit is great and it is easy to iron on. Thanks."
1,5 Stars?? Have you ever listened to Black Star?,"I dont know how all of you are giving this album 5 Stars. Compared to Black Star and Reflection Eternal, this album is wack!! The production is clumsy and poorly edited, and who ever thought you would here Talib Greene reffering to Louis Vurton bags on the mainstream sounding ""Waiting 4 the DJ"". Compared to the new Roots cd, this is a drink coaster. Get back to me Talib, when you drop Black Star II with Mos."
3,Pretty High Kwelity,"now if you're a big talib kweli like me then you'll probably love this cd. however, it does lack a unifying vibe because of the sporadic production and the more commercial, less appealing feel that was missing on 'train of thought' and 'mos def and talib kweli are black star'. lyrically, it's still very very good. 'get by', the big single produced by the great kanye west ('the college dropout' is real tight), is one of talib's finest ever, but the other songs just don't live up. don't get me wrong, i enjoy every song on the album, but talib isn't at his best. even so, a talib kweli at 3/4 power is still better than a lot of the garbage on the radio nowadays. his pulsating voice and aggressive activism still are prevalent on this 'quality'. however, because it doesn't have one feel it can't be considered a classic in hip hop history."
5,Quality and quantity,Man this cd is every thing you could want. The best song is number nine. The beat is cold (another one of kanye west best). But besides that this cd is a must have for a real collectors libary of good music. A must have.
4,Kweli has changed!,"whether for the better or worse, I am not sure. He has got a new style of production supporting him and some people do not like the new sound. However, Talib, his lyrics, flow, and topics are all still on point and as dope as ever, maybe even more-so focused than on the Reflection Eternal album.It's a great release to check and there's heaps of songs to enjoy for the true hip hopper.peace,"
3,Reflection Eternal was too hard to top,"Although Talib has one of the tightest flows ever recorded, he fails to make this cd an album. I find myself skipping tracks, and some of the beats are wack. If no one else admits it, I just did. Ditching Hi-Tek is where he went wrong (Although Hi-Teknology was kinda weak). So what if Kweli proves that he can flow to different producers, he lacks continuity on this one. Pick up Reflection Eternal, once you catch a few tracks off this one, you'll thank me for saving you $20."
1,NO QUALITY,"Talib's music used to emerge from the void sparkling, progressing harmoniously with the bass line--lyrics painting a picture though adrenalin and pure soul. This..... is whack.I suppose the industry turns every solo artist out sooner or later but I really had my fingers crossed on this one. In fact, he used to be one of those artists you get hype about like ""aw ..., he got anotha hot joint about to drop, I'm gonna snatch that on-line before it's even released."" And then you get soft beats, soft lyrics, mushy hooks and too much singing. If you want something that will get your head nodding saying ""tru dat"" or ""oh ...!"" or even original and unique flavorful beats...DO NOT, I repeat...DO NOT buy this album. Keep the old rotation: Mos Def, Blackstar, Roots, Reflection Eternal, Like Water for Chocolate, Slum Village. QUALITY is a fall of creativity and potential from one of my favorite MCs."
5,Amazing.,"Well to start off: order came in fast, well packaged, came with a poster, and needless to say it was an AMAZING movie."
5,Macro and portrait lens,"This is a lens you should have in your bag and use. This lens is Sharp!!!!! This summer I did a little macro but a lot of model shoots and this lens is perfect. I would buy again and again, you can buy a camers brand lens and pay twice as much and not get a better lens. I don't care what brand of camera my students have, but I tell them the glass is what's counts. Tamron makes this lens for all brands, so buy it."
2,Pain managment,Of all the burke books this was the most dissapointing. Throughout the book no clues were given.
5,Excellent and Funny Counting Book,"I loved the concept of this book and how they showed different ways of counting to 10, 20, 30, etc. Very humerous and can be quite interactive with kids."
5,Loves it,Perfect CD for my little baby. I love the song selections. It's perfect according to what music they should listen to for brain development.
5,criss angel 4,the product was in a great conditions just as told. And very fast shipping. Thanks for your product
1,DON'T BUY THIS GAME!!!,"This is the worst game ever made! Not Realistic.. Boring, Boring,Just a shame a good Deer Hunting Game isn't out there... I returned this game back to the store I got it from. Listen to the others who have written longer reviews on all the Cons of this game and DON'T BUY IT... You will be disappointed if you do.... PS... This only got the STAR because it wouldn't let me give ZERO STARS...Best Wishes"
2,dull main character,"A disappointment from one of my favorite authors. The main problem is that the point-of-view character is dull as dishwater. The treacly tone is also jarringly out of line with his frequent allusions to Mark Twain (who knew how to write a sermon without preaching), and the mystery aspect of the story falls flat. Pohl covered the same coming-of-age territory much more effectively in his wonderful novel Homegoing."
5,beautyful done,In this collction of hits Lil Suzy sound very fresh and show off voice like never before.You can tell what a beutyful and powerfull voice she have and how good she use it. The more you listen to this album the more you will love it.
4,My first Camera phone,"I like this phone. It's my first camera phone, so I don't have too much to compare it to. The picture quality is ok, but it is a camera PHONE."
1,"Product never worked, but AMAZOM is still the BEST!","I bought this CD player as a gift for my son, It never worked properly. I thought I was out of luck since the 30 day return guarantee was more like 90 days when the problem was discovered. I thought I'd give it a shot and contact customer service and low and behold, they said go ahead send it back for a full refundAMAZOM has a loyal customer here as I've bought about a dozen things that work great and as expected"
2,Stopped working after 1 year,I've had this CD player for a year sitting on my desk in my office when it suddently stopped working. The player now skids even without any shaking or movement and it is impossible to hear a track properly. I tried changing CDs but to no advantage. I suspect that it is poorly built and I am currently looking for a replacement. I will try with a SONY. It worked nicely before but the short life-span makes it a big no no.
4,Good find!,"I never knew all of what happened in the first of the comics, never knew who came from where and who started out with who. Things like this were cleared up after reading these. I was disapointed however to find that none of them were in color."
4,Peaceful and pleasureable,"I love Thomas Kinkade paintings. The pictures are paired up with quotes from the bible as well as other sources including Robert Frost, Shakespeare, and Robert Louis Stevenson. My favorite is The Light of Peace picture (lighthouse on the craggy cliffs, stone cottage with warm lights glowing, waves crashing and the sun setting) paired with the quote ""The light shines in the darkness."""
5,A care givers must read,This book will drive the new millenium to a healthy sense of self for all readers. The book gives caregivers the tool to work with the damaged souls of the people that they work with. This book also gives the reader a guide to live a more healthy life. I recommend the book strongly for all to read to better understand and face their fears about something talked about but never really put to words.
1,This game sucks (geddit?),"I had high hopes for this game. Almost every single review I read was positive. They talked about good graphics, good voice acting, and a generally good game. None of that is true. Sure, some of the voice acting (from the actual cast of the show) is fine, but the horribly long pauses between each line of dialogue ruin anything that might be there. And that's not even counting the game play, which is simplistic ""run around and click until you find the right door to open"" and ""fight badly."" Which brings us to what could laughably be called a fighting engine. I spent most of my time yelling: ""No, don't kick the air, kick the vampire. Turn around, turn around. No, go the direction I'm pointing."" I press the punch button, and two seconds later, I punch. Great. This game is horrible. Please stay away. Stay far away. Put a stake in it, it's done."
1,Company shipped totally wrong product,The order arrived in the correct box. However inside we found a Dance Dance Revolution game. Have filed a complaint and waiting to hear something back.
4,BTVS Fans will Love IT!,"This game stays true to the series and the voice overs are great! The story line is pretty good and brings back some great baddies! I would recommend this game to anyone who is a fan of BTVS. Others may or may not enjoy it. Some levels are very simple and others are rather difficult to complete. I don't play the game as much as I used to but even when I played for hours on end I still never got through the entire game. Maybe I'm just slow, but overall it was weel worth the money paid."
5,"FUN, EXCITING...and Buffy lives again","Buffy Chaos Bleeds is one of the best game. The graphics are not bad at all. The cartoon looks of the characters in this game looks excactly the same to the real live characters in the show.It's very impressive!!!!The game control for PS2 is very easy. The voices for BUFFY is not bad because the voice actor for Buffy really captured the voice of Sarah Michelle Gellar. The combat moves are great, too. All that kicking..martial arts..punching that Buffy does in the show is also similar in the video game..I recommend this game..BUY it...This game is worth BUYING...I hope Buffy video games will continue.............."
1,It's false,"This book has nothing of import. If you've read Introduction to Hermetics then you've already got a handful to do. If not, then by Introduction to Hermetics, not this tripe!"
5,Great album - better the more you listen.,Great album - good mix of fast/slow... if you like Wilco's - yankee hotel... you will like this one.
4,"Fascinating, but badly titled","Had Reznikov called this book something more like ""Behind Orwell's Newspeak: the Societal Truth of 1984,"" he would have sold more copy and been more accurate.This book reads like a short masters' thesis on a fascinating, but very narrow subject. ... Between the lines lies Reznikov's well-deserved worship of the man who foresaw (at least in lingual terms) the rise and fall of the Third Reich and the Soviet Union. Also, Reznikov suggests (again, between the lines) that, just as Tolkien originally conceived Middle Earth in order to create a separate reality where characters could speak Elvish, Orwell's greatest fictional work, 1984, probably grew out of his desire to display his theoretical language, Newspeak.This book is a must for those who love Orwell and 1984; it will help you to understand both better. The book is dry in subject, and a bit repetitive, but wet in enthusiasm. Reznikov enjoys his concept and may well have a future in literary non-fiction beyond Orwell."
3,Awesome web technologies destroyed by non-working examples,"This book covers awesome web technologies; however, non-working created a lot of frustrations on my part and makes me wonder about the validity of the entire book altogether.To the authors, try to test run your examples before releasing the book and its cd."
2,Great product - but lasts about 100 hours of gaming use,"I loved this item when I first got it. No problems of drifting as witnessed on other wireless controllers and battery life was great. Unfortunately, my controller started to detriorate as the gaming hours went on. First to go was the left analog rubber pad, it started to wear down where my thumb was on it until eventually it came off. I took the right analog pad's rubber off since I don't use that as much and put it on the left. That gave me about a further 50 hours of play. Then the same analog stick stopped turning left. Everything else worked, but I couldn't turn left or up/down left in any game. I eventually took it apart and played with the calibration until I managed to get it working again. Since then I've had to do it 3 times. I guess I may as well throw it away and get a new one. I won't be buying this particular Logitech contoller again though. Once for casual gamers or people who like to take things apart."
3,"Good, but whats up with the lag?","It is a great feel and grip, but in halo, sometimes the aimer wants to wander aimlessly.. some interfearance but i cant pinpoint it.."
4,Good Enough for Me,"Doesn't feel exactly like a the Microsoft controller. The joysticks are a little to snappy and of course it doesn't sit in the hand the same because it has a different shape.But. Logitech peripherals are always solid and reliable, not like some of the horrible off-brand controllers that I grew up with (Matcatz, Niko, etc.) I wish it felt just like the real deal, but it's a small price to pay for a cheap, cordless controller that is so reliable.Oh and the receiver that you plug into the Xbox is big and ugly, but it's mainly because it's also a port for memory cards, instead of having them on the controller, which I don't like anyway."
1,What Not To Do,"While not a good book to read for direct advice, it is very useful if parents read between the lines. The book focuses on the negative aspects of adopting older children, usually using personal anecdotes and horror stories to illustrate the author's points, and almost always placing the blame on the adopted children. While I didn't find any of the information useful or practical, it is an excellent tool for what not to do. In many of the anecdotes, it is easy to see how the parents' responses to difficult behavior only serve to exacerbate the behavior. Pairing this book with Parenting the Hurt Child or Adopting the Hurt Child by Gregory Keck and Regina Kupecky will give you insight into how parenting styles and responses affect children's attachment and behavior."
4,Good social work text,"I am a first year MSW student. We had to read this book for class and I have so far enjoyed the text. Sometimes, however, it can be really theoretical and jargon-y."
1,Pretty sure this is not a real Heyer book,"To the best of my knowledge, Ms. Heyer never wrote a book with this title. I suspect the used seller had a clerk whose mind was not on the job, and that this book is *supposed* to be AN INFAMOUS ARMY."
3,JUST ORDERED THE BOOK,This book was recommended to me by a girlfriend who happens to be a therapist. I ordered the book based on her suggestion and read the reviews after I placed my order. Most of the reviews were good but some stated it was nonsense and weak. I will let you know once I receive my book and see for myself if it's all hype or not.
1,Misleading,"Okay I bought this book because I thought I would read some views that I had not heard before. It ended being cliche ridden from start to page 25 ( That's how far I wen't before realizing it was nonsense). The examples presented in this book are all about black men and black females? Yet the book talks about women in general? There are huge differences between the races and how each race responds to lines such as, "" Girl you so fine"", that line would get no lady to be interested in a man in many races. The men presented are so sleezy and corny, that it is a wonder that they are regarded as players by the author. Since when is cool to call a girl straight after seeing her? Or calling her on a Sunday morning to join her for Church? This book was utter garbage and a waste of hard earned money."
3,Just above average...,"I am still in the process of reading this book. It has a nice style. I find that it jumps around from topic to topic a bit, so there are some gaps. Of course it is impossible to expect any one book to provide all the answers. I always try and get my hands on several to get a more complete picture. Overall I would rate this book as just above average. I do appreciate the focus on the Jet engine and relational databases. It is quite intensive."
5,My start!,"Chocolate Obsession has started my new career. I am a trained chef and this book has put me over the moon about making chocolates. I now have a side business selling truffles. The unique combinations have spurred my creativity to develop my own flavors that sell in the area that I live. I consistently refer back to Michaels book for the ""basics"", which I feel he does a fine job of detailing. The fleur de Sel Caramel is awsome. It barely gets out of my kitchen. Yes this book is not always for the novice, however, with patience and the internet to help one look up additonal information it can be a valuable resource.My book is worn and much loved. I now order my chocolate from a wholesaler 100 pounds at a time and sell my chocolates for $1.65 each, thanks to this book!"
4,Great Stuff,"I always wanted to make some kind if chocolates and this is the book that inspired me! His directions connected with me instantly. Giving me the confidence I needed. The tarragon with candied grapefruit was my first attempt. And they came out exquisit. Lemon verbena and the anise with pink peppercorn were also got rave reviews. The tahitan marshmallows were also a first. Wonderful just wonderful! The malt ice cream ,roasted banana ice cream. And i can go on and on. I'm a middle aged guy who likes to cook and bake and now i do chocolates. Get the book, you'll be very happy you did."
1,Hate speech on a shirt,WTH!!! I can't believe anyone would think it is acceptable to put such a hurtful word on a shirt. I hope nobody buys it.
1,This camera is trash!!,"We bought this camera about 3 years ago, we had it for 5 months and it was never mishandled; used about 5 times. Then the tape started popping out and it wouldn't stay closed. Well, we had a service plan with it. Had to drive it 60 miles one way each time!! It has been fixed for the same problem 2 times now. It just sits in the closet. The plan is expired and we found out that it will cost about $90 to repair it (again). There is only 3 on ebay like it and 2 of those are not working as well!! Do not buy a Sony camcorder!!!"
1,buy USA,"This company is from the UK. They state they ship from DL, makeing you think this is Del. USA. It is Del. UK. I buy from the USA when I can. It takes longer to ship from Del. UK than Del. USA. It should be plain if a company is from the UK or USA.Do not misslead us.Harold"
4,A must for any Jon Lord fan,"This is great. Bach onto this reminds Vangelis. Good musicians, some from Bad Company ! This edition comes with good bonus tracks and the booklet is quite good. There is also an interview from Jon. The master of HAMMOND, although here he plays the piano beautifully. It is not Deep Purple or hard rock at its best, but the songs are quite good. Try also Pictured Within, the best from his solo career in my opinion."
4,Deep Purple keyboardist goes solo,"Jon Lord recorded several solo albums over the years and this one is the best for the average listener. Combining classical workouts like ""Bach Onto This"" with beautiful ballads like ""Where are You"" and ""Before I Forget,"" Lord has come up with his most accessible album. Having not played my LP copy in more than a decade, I forgot how many great tracks were on this release. But discovering them again was a pleasant experience. Rock, prog/rock, classical, pop--it's all here. Let's not forget this late great composer, who stood tall alongside Keith Emerson, Rick Wakeman and Rod Argent."
2,This cable is for power only,"Buyer Beware! This cable is advertised as a power and data cable, but has no data capability. The picture is not even close to accurate. The cable I received was a flimsy retractable cable.Again, this cable has no data capability. Overcharged for shipping and product- not even worth sending back to the seller..."
4,Great book on digital b/w photography-lots of ideas as well,"This is a very good book indeed. Basically it covers the concepts you need to know in order to capture good color images on your digital camera that can then later be converted to black and white. It further goes on to explain and suggest all the various options open to you to make this photo marketable and or a work of art. While I don't agree 100% with everything said, I am on board for 95%. The provided photos are great and inspiring and the book address both manual ways in photoshop to convert to B/w (besides just clicking greyscale or desaturate) as well as the plugins available out there. Having said this,be aware that this is a very photoshop centric book too."
4,Finally I understand how to this!,"I have been trying to get a job with the federal government for a long time. I was never sure how to write the 612, resume and KSA's . After reading this book, I feel like I have a really excellent chance to get the job that I want. The real life examples and tips are extremely helpful. I'll keep you posted..."
1,Smart People.... STUPID Movie!,"Boy what a lousy movie this is. It's listed as a comedy, yet there is virtually NOTHING funny in it. The only two remotely funny scenes involve one character's butt. The movie has no plot. Dennis Quaid's character is a monotone, emotionless man. It becomes so annoying it makes you want to fast forward to see if anything happens. There is nothing entertaining or interesting in this movie.Not worth buying, not even worth renting!!!"
4,Good movie,"good movie to enjoy on a good rainy sunday afternoon with he wife. Well the acting is very good to begin with, the story line a bit non-judgemental for it's viewed from many angles, the strongest beginning with how the title makes you go one way and the characters the other. the big ""huh?"" with good acting and funny happenings. It's a good dark comedy that plays with your head a bit. I also enjoy the way the music is composed with the movie and makes certain scenes. what's funny is that I looked up the singer/songwriter and found his music to be bad, so there was some excellent editing going on. pretty good flick, your classic starts out sad to good movie, twist on the romantic comedy of errors..."
2,dumber by the minute,I felt really dumb watching this. I turned it off after a little while and I didn't feel so dumb.
3,Touchpad not reliable,"I bought this keyboard because I had shoulder surgery on my right shoulder and mousing was painful. Though the touchpad would be the answer. Unfortunately, this touchpad is not very well made. Too often, it would interpret my finger movements incorrectly.The main offender was the ""back"" functionality. To do a back, you need to slide your finger to the left at the top edge of the touchpad. Too many times, I would be moving my finger to the left not at the top edge but the touchpad would register a back and take me to the previous webpage. I could have disabled that function, but then how would I have done a ""back""? I know Alt-LeftArrow works but that's not a good solution. Nor is clicking the right button and then selecting back.Other than that, it was a good keyboard with a very customizable touchpad. If you don't surf the web much, it might be just the thing. It wasn't for me. Now I'm using the mouse with my left hand and I've gotten used to it, so my shoulder's ok."
5,Frehair Daily Detangler,"I use both Mastey shampoo and the detangler, Frehair. I have use these products for over 15 years. I have oily hair and any conditioner made it worse. What I love about Frehair is it leaves not residue on your hair. So it never made my hair oily.Traite and Frehair together make great hair care.I have recommended these products to several people. They have all loved it."
2,I ordered the conditioner but I received the detangler instead.,I have been using the conditioner for many years and love it..I did not realize they sent me the wrong item until I used it once.. and my hair was not as soft as when I use the conditioner. The bottles look the same.
4,L'Oreal Age Perfect Pro-Calcium Day Cream,"This product looks old. The box was broken and yellowed. The cream seems fine, although I haven't used it yet."
4,"A great book, written only 15 years after the Atom Bomb",Great insight on the events leading up to the first Atom Bomb drop.
2,Nothing like her first book,"I love The Barefoot Contessa's first cookbook, and Ina Garten's second book Parties is nice as well. This third book is most disappointing. The recipes are so simple, and who needs a recipe for French toast? and a whole section on kid's recipes. I love her shop in the Hampton's, and some of her recipes are staples in my home. I would not bother with this latest book."
4,Great Food,"I tend to disagree with some of the negative reviews. I have cooked many of the recipes for guests and have had many requests for the recipes. The lasagna is wonderful and EASY, the spinach is very good, the chicken and biscuits is a crowd pleaser, etc. I am very happy with my book - and have given many copies as hostess gifts."
4,Simple Family Food,"The recipes are simple and work. It's one of those books you can pick up when your family look at you in that what's-for-dinner way and have a meal on the table pretty quickly. It's got some good tips, e.g. making ""homemade gravy"" in advance and how to jazz up vegetables in a simple way."
5,Great Condition!,"Bought this cookbook used and it arrived in beautiful condition (just as it was described by the seller, a library volunteer organization)."
4,Another Winner...,"This book is targeted toward family style dining and comfort foods often with an interesting but tasty twist. The recipes include pictures, easy to find ingredients, and easy to follow directions. You don't have to be a seasoned chef to use and enjoy her book. The food comes out great every time!"
3,What Happened?,"Ms. Garten presents a lovely cookbook and has good ideas for atmosphere, music, etc. But sadly, this book misses the mark. I feel her other books were better and I use many, many recipes from them. There are very few recipes we will be using - the Chicken Soup looks delicious.Maybe she's taken on too much with the Oprah monthly articles, her store, touring, etc. I live on the East End of Long Island, not far from The Barefoot Contessa and I don't want to sound mean, but I feel this book could have been a better."
5,Barefoot Contessa Family Style,"This is my 5th Barefoot Contessa cookbook and this one is every bit as wonderful as the other four books. The recipes are versatile, easy to follow and they are fail safe. I can easily prepare a new recipes from Family Style for my family or friends with the confidence that it will turn out delicious and the results are as if I had been making these recipes for years. I am very happy that I purchased this cookbook."
2,Not up to standards of her previous books.,"The photos are attractive and the text is well-written, just as in her other books, but I agree with those who say the recipes are just not worth much. I agree with the reviewer from Phoenix who says this book seems to have been rushed out in order to capitalize on the success of the first two books. There is just nothing in here that I have any desire to make (or that I don't already have a million good recipes for).Also, a stylistic thing that drives me nuts: nearly every single recipe in all her cookbooks is attributed to ""My dear friend [so-and-so]"" -- OK, we get it, Ina, everyone loves you -- and her constant chirping of ""How easy is that?"" starts to grate after a while."
3,"Looks great, but doesn't deliver with some items","I have been in love with cooking for the past 10 years, and I do not have trouble following cookbook recipes, but this one wasn't as fool-proof as it appears.To clarify things, her main dishes turn out good, but the desserts aren't perfected. I make my own bread and make my own butter when fancy strikes, yet the tiramisu I made using her recipe exact, was the worst cake ever. The Key Lime frozen pie I made was also terrible! Too Limey and plainly unsavory.I don't think I have ever baked anything that didn't turn out unsatisfactionary until this book!I like her show and recipes for shrimp scampi, side dishes, drinks, chicken dishes and salads but I will not be using her dessert recipes, I know better than that by now.Too bad, it would have been a great book, but the dissert thing make me scare of using it at all."
5,Good Recipes,I like a lot of the normal foods (not the super fancy stuff) and this book delivers nicely. I entertain a lot and people really seem to like it.
5,The Muggletonian Archive,"This is an brilliant piece of literary criticism that should be of great interest to anyone interested in English radicalism and antinomianism.The real gem here -- the part that I have returned to read again and again-- are the appendices which include a short account titled ""The Muggletonian Archive"". Here E.P. Thompson recounts his meeting with ""last Muggletonian"", the last living adherent to a 17th century sect, and the role he played in seeing that the church's archives were preserved in the British Library. A great story.Thompson maintains, if I remember correctly, that Blake's mother may have been a Muggletonian and that songs and tropes from that tradition had a great influence on Blake's mythology.You do not need to be convinced by Thompson's argument to find this book engrossing and thought-provoking. Well worth seeking out."
5,Gems of Wisdom Heart of Gold is a gift of a Moslem primer,"In Gems of Wisdom Heart of Gold we are offered fascinating, thought-provoking & sometimes, humorous insights into the world's largest religious community. With over one billion followers, Islam now reaches every corner of our world & yet is one of the most misunderstood & least understood by Westerners.Why is that? I have had a little exposure to the Moslem way of thought, taking a few months of teaching, the better to understand a friend's way of life & simply found it confounded me.Now I can ponder on the words of luminaries of Islam, from ancient to modern, & begin to be less ignorant. Stirring & quiet, obtuse & obvious, the aphorisms & speeches give a glimpse into another way of thinking.In Gems of Wisdom Heart of Gold we can take a look at another philosophy & be not strangers to the friends among us. A great gift for anyone interested in philosophy & religion. Do check out my site for my full review & eInterview with this author/editor."
5,A Potent source of inspiration,"A Clear guidance for this age old wisdom propounded by so many enlightened souls from Abraham to Muhammad, peace be upon them. A potent source of inspiration and guidance for purifying the soul and attaining the divine presence."
2,Will not do a flush cut!!!!,I am going to make this short and sweet. I brought this saw based on its strong reviews. Over all its a very nice jigsaw don't get me wrong but I can not get a flush cut. It will start off flush but then the blade wonders back and forth. I have tryed many things to correct this as well as I contact bosch and they just told me to try things that I had already tryed. This saw would of gotten a 5 stars if it would do a flush cut.
2,"Forget about this one, buy the 1590EVSK.","The $50 extra is well worth it. The 1590EVSK has a much better blade-change system, substantially more power, a better shoe tilt mechanism, a shorter shoe projection in front (you can cut closer), and FEELS a lot more high-quality!"
3,"Surpassed by the new Milwaukee, except for trigger?","I bought this and the Milwaukee (see my review there). I'm returning the Bosch. The Milwaukee runs smoother and has better adjustments. I like the idea of the variable trigger on the Bosch, but the Bosch still jumps when starting, even when starting slow. So for me, the variable trigger isn't a strong enough advantage as I'd hoped it would be. :-( I'm hoping I'll eventually like the variable dial on the Milwaukee."
2,blade change nightmare,"this saw worked well,cut well,quiet,smooth, but the blade change is real bad. the cheap plastic turn lever broke the second time i used it,a very poor design. for that reason i would never recommend this saw"
5,Phone message 400 ct books,This item came within 2 days of ordering; very pleased with product. Will buy again when these are used up.
2,just so confusing,"Having used Greene's text for my undergraduate econometrics course I think its really important to point out its faults.1The layout is confusing and hard to follow,2the math is clunky and inelegant3its more useful as a weapon (SO heavy)4Plus it gives asymptotic results in a somewhat misleading manner.5It is far from impossible to cover results of the same level in a clearer and more COHERENT way6Probably its only strong point is that it covers a vast number of topics.7Why is this text so widely used?"
5,the simpsons are back and better than ever EXCELLENT GAME,"SIMPSONS HIT AND RUN IS THE BEST GAME!!!!!! YOU CAN PLAY AS HOMER,BART,LISA,MARGE,AND APU SO IF YOU ARE A HUGE SIMPSONS FAN(like ME)BUY THIS GAME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,One of the greats,"This was one of the best simpson games i have ever played. Nintendo and Vivendi Universal really made a good effort to make this game. Theres only one downside i beat the game in 3 days (but thats just me) You switch off as Homer,Bart,Lisa,Marge, and Apu, to try and save the world. This game has 7 levels Homer has 2 levels and Bart has 2 Lisa has 1 Marge has 1 and Apu has 1. This game was like Grand Theft Auto only without so much cursing and violence, you can run over people and kick them but they don't get hurt. This game is truley one of the greats."
5,Best Simpsons Game as of now,This game is great.The missions rock.It has really fast cars from the show.The civilians are so funny.It's better than Simpsons Road Rage which was wasn't bad.So if I were you I would buy it because it rocks.
2,should have been better,"i expected it to be worth buyin but it wasn't. this game starts off alright but gets boring really fast. plus, ive owned 2 copy's now and both of them froze every ten minutes without a scratch or finger print. as far as i can tell, they didnt get all the bugs out of it before releasing it."
5,good for education,good for educationup to date as possible in this changing world.We have had several others of these and enjoyed them also.
5,The Suffering rocks!,"Wow, I knew that this game was supposed to be creepy and action packed, but this exceeded all of my expectations!The prison setting alone is enough to make it really scary, but throwing in voices in the main character's head, insanely twisted monsters and weird happenings...I had to turn the lights back on!Nice job by Surreal and Midway in putting together a winner...I score this a 9 out of 10."
3,"Not Bad, But Not Great","Does contain an overview of the different types of power adders, but is more or less an introduction. Contains less info and content than I was hoping for, but for the price it is not bad at all. There are more informative books that will give you a much better understanding of the subjects contained, but if you're looking for a quick intro to these subjects, this oughta get you there. In the end, I was left wanting much more info, but wasn't set back enough cash-wise to feel too disappointed."
3,Like it but water has a little funny taste.,I don't know if it is attributable to the machine or the bottle but the water tastes a little funny. I will see if that changes over time.
2,Not 100% safe plastic,"The Bluewave 3 Gallon Multi-Use Water Bottle description claims that it is 100% safe plastic and does not leech chemicals into water. This made me think that the plastic would not be #7 (the most harmful plastic that there is), but when it arived it was #7! I am disappointed in the description of this water bottle."
1,came with a hole in it.,I had to return it; The bottle came with a hole in it. I then bought one at Lowe's with water in it for much less. In their favor the return process was excellent.
4,"big plastic bottle, what else can you expect?","Came fast, works great for what it is, we love the handles, and that it's small enough for my wife to be able to carry and put on. Nothing else magic about it, just a big plastic bottle, would have been nice to be a bit cheaper since we found 5 gallon ones for the same price as these 3 gallon ones."
5,GREAT!!!,This book had all the puzzles that I love and a great mix of them too. It also has a few fun facts and stories to keep things interesting. Love it.
1,There were no other reviews,"There were no other reviews on this product but I bought it any ways because it looked like a very useful product. Problem is that while my PEG SJ20 fit, I could not get it to snap securely into place making the case rather useless.The instructions are limited and it seems easy to do, but the back clips just do not do the job."
1,Hard case for the SJ22,"My first issue with this product is that it is incredibly, incredibly hard to open. The ""latch"" on the side is made up of two nubs that fit into two groves - it fits so tightly that I have to slide my fingernail in the crack of the case and then pry it open. I guess this is a good feature if you want to protect your PDA and never use it.Secondly, the stylus is very hard to remove. Because the case fits the PDA so tightly, the stylus is trapped. Once again, I have to use my fingernail to pull the stylus up.Thirdly, I don't feel like the PDA is secure within the case when the case is open. The PDA is attached to the case by two metal pins where the factory cover attaches and another in the middle of the back of the PDA. The bottom of my PDA still has enough ""wiggle room"" to come in and out of the case when it is open.I have owned two other aluminum hard cases for other PDA's and both had much higher quality and usability than this. My suggestion - buy a different case."
4,a good buy,"I bought this for my SJ 20 (my first pda). I'm notoriously clumsy, and sure enough, I dropped it within a couple of weeks. No damage, so I guess it did the job.The little metal prongs that hold the pda in the case are pretty poor, but a little bending makes them hold the clie pretty securely. Overall, I'm pleased with the convenience, minimal weight, and protection - and the significantly lower price compared to the other cases I found."
4,Good simple case,"I was looking for a case that was sturdy and protective, yet simple and lightweight. I think the iConcepts case does just that. It seems very durable, and I now no longer fear having my PDA fall out of my pocket. Additionally, it doesn't seem to scratch easily. It's very nice that you do not have to remove the case to use any of the slots or buttons.Cons: The mechanism of holding the PDA in place while the case is open is not that great, allowing the PDA to fall out if you open the case and turn it upside down, and give it a slight nudge.Overall: excellent case, especially for the price, compared with hard cases found on other websites or from other manufacturers."
5,Great Detective Stories: Good insight into early Nazi Germany,"This series was recommended to me by my History Teacher son. The detective story part is just as intriguing as any other series I have read in the past, but the real gem is the insight into Nazi Germany from the Germans caught in a country taken over by evil forces, who hated the system but felt trapped."
2,TOUGH TO GET HOSE OUT,"I purchased this model and have found it wanting since it is very, very difficult to get the hose pulled out for use. The rewind function works well.I purchased a less expense modeL that does not have the enclosure that the RS 06001 has for the hose. The less expense model works very well and does have any problem when pulling the hose out."
5,Concerto Veneziano,"Superb! I highly recommend this CD to all classical music lovers. Violinist, Mr. Carmignola, is fantastic! Buy it, you won't be disappointed.P. Cooper"
1,Comic Book,Waste of money. Web site did not indicate this was a comic book rather than a a full story.
2,Repetition.. repetition...,"Simpsons Hit & Run deserves kudos for its great graphics, sound and resemblance to the tv-series. It's fun in the beginning.After playing for a while though, the repetitive nature of the game becomes evident. For example, you have just one minute and thirty seconds to get somewhere, and you have to race like heck. It is funny in the beginning, but then it gets frustrating. About every second task is a race against the time, and the time is really really pushed. It gets so frustrating to race, race and race against time.. even for the most stupid objectives, that it becomes a truly frustrating game. With such great graphics, why not vary some more?I'm dead tired of timed races and to have to start over and over again for being a second or two too late.Go watch another Simpsons episode over again instead."
4,For Simpsons fans,"The gameplay is repetitive, the controls are loose, some of the missions are too simple, some of the missions are too tough, the map system could be better, umm...and some other stuff. This can be very frustrating at times but if you're a Simpsons fan it's a must have. The best part is exploring Springfield.Graphics: 4.5Sound: 4.5Controls: 4.0Fun Factor: 4.5"
2,Extremly Easy Found No Need To Purchase This One,I think this game was a complete knock-off of Grand Theft Auto only with a lot less violence and the only funny part is when you hit people and the character says something. The levels are outrageously easy and theres really nothing to do after you beat the game. There are also about forty cars in the game and most of them are stupid. Do not buy this game reapeat do not buy this game it is too easy.
1,DO NOT BUY THIS GAME,"This was single-handedly the worst game I have ever played. It was boring, confusing, and so repetitive it made me want to scream!"
2,"cool game to have, but to hard to play","this game was cool when i first got it . and pretty popular after a few rounds of hard and easy i stopped wining and stared skipping each level . it just keeped getting hard to to play and its easy to give up. i'd love to give it to game stop but my sister keeps insisting we keep it . and i suck at driving games . i love the simpsons , but i hate this game"
3,Not too bad,"It's not an unuseful book. Problems of cultural clash during mergers are not a new topic in management literature, but since most executives still don't seem to care much about that, this book is valuable. The methods described by the authors are interesting, the check lists are useful, but it's definitely a book written by consultants: ""You gather people in a meeting room, you have the big boss do a speech, you make everyone work together during 2 hours, and that's it"". If only it was that simple...And the chapter about ""organization as a system"" has no purpose."
2,Essence & Alchemy by Mandy Aftel,"I was very excited when I ordered this book , but on arrival my excitement quickly turned to disappointment !! The cover looks very colorful , but upon opening the book the printing is very very light, and all the headings in the entire bookare so light as to be almost invisible !! It's as though the printer tried to use as little ink as possible !! I have to use a magnifier to read all the headings and titles in the book ! This is very frustrating to say the least ! The subjectmaterial in the book seems to be well done, and I'm sure it's all very informativewith much knowledge on the subject available to the reader if only you knew what the author was talking about in each chapter without having to strain your eyes atevery turn !! Probably a good book , but spoiled by a very very bad printer !"
2,More Than You Wanted to Know about Perfume,"I read this book for my book group, and did not really care for it. This was a non-fiction history of the art of perfume-making going back to ancient and Biblical times. I found the writer's style to be very repetitive; she said the same thing in several slightly different ways, sometime on the same page or even in the same paragraph. It just contained too much detailed information for my interest level. It also contained dozens of ""how to"" recipes for concocting your own fragrances or perfumes. solid perfumes, bath oils, bath salts, etc. For someone who practices massage or aromatherapy, this book probably would have been more relevant. I am an accountant at a major university, and I think I will stick to classic fiction, thrillers, etc."
1,dissapointed.,"This book read like a journal and not a very interesting one. There was lots of telling, no showing, and I found myself not caring a bit about any of the characters as they were extremely two dimensional. The main character was annoying, the editing was non existent and I seriously doubt the author has had any experieince at all with submission or dominance. She completely misses the mark on it."
2,Too wordy,"I did not finish the book. A lot of it seemed to me like the typical journal entries of a young woman, a lot of soul searching, romantic thoughts, thoughts about being different...One of the phrases that are repeated over and over again: ""I have to learn how to think..."" It's probably just me, but I started to get really annoyed by that statement.In my opinion these diaries are just too personal, too intimate and not significant enough to be published."
1,Don't bother,"I expected to really enjoy this book as I found the subject fascinating and new to me. Unfortunately, the stilted writing and the lack of substance made it unreadable. I think a book about this woman's life with quotes interjected would be more interesting than this rambling collection of thoughts. I'm very disappointed."
5,a charming story,"For children 3 years old and up.As Faith the snail relates in this simple, pleasant tale of transformation, ""As the world turns, so do you. When you change for the good, you change the world too.""Faith is the wise mentor of Anew, a young caterpillar who feels growing pangs of doubt and uncertainty. Though Anew dreams of standing atop rosebuds and viewing mountains from the sky, he is also afraid. Through further dreams and Faith's counsel, Anew learns that ""thinking like a caterpillar does not work for butterflies."" Following the flow of his own inner yearnings, Anew comes to embrace the mystery of change.This charming story provides reassurance to young readers who are just learning to navigate their own changing world. Vibrant watercolor illustrations from award-winning artist Aries Cheung add humor and a lovely dash of zip to Anew's adventures."
5,The mageborn Traitor,"This is one of the best fantasy books i've every read. I've reas this book so many times my copy is falling apart, hopefully Ms. Rawn will be getting the Captal's Tower out soon."
3,Half-half,"I was really looking forward to this book, and while I'm not absoulutley crushed, I'm not thrilled either. Glenin's frequent attempts to kill her sisters starts seeming kind of silly, especially compared to the first book. There was, I felt, a lot more subltey to the first one. The way Joss falls in love with Cai seems slightly awkward. The plot does move along nicely, and I'm still going to buy the last one, but overall, I was left with a vauge feeling of dissaticfaction."
4,The Greatest Book - YET!!!,"All right, let me start out by explaining my outrageously low review of 4 stars for this book: I'm reserving that fifth star for THE CAPTAL's TOWER, which will be ""The Greatest Book - EVER!"" I have read many of Melanie Rawn's books, although due to the cover art on Dragon Prince Book I I picked up the Star Scroll so my mother would let me get it, then SHE said don't get Book II get Book I, so I was lucky. Melanie Rawn must be THE greatest AUTHOR ever to grace the science fantasy world. This book is awesome, and anyone who has EVER read science fantasy should read this or they might as well never read a book again. All I can say is that I can't WAIT for THE CAPTAL's TOWER!!!!!!!!!!"
3,More than a bit disappointing,"Melanie Rawn leaves too much undone in this novel, and makes the long wait we've endured for ""The Captal's Tower"" all the more aggravating.Too much is left open....what about the defective babies that are born and spirited away (which would expose the system of Tiers as ineffective), the true history of most of the characters, and why is Cailet, of all people, the new Captal? She seems a bit inept, and frankly, I don't like her all that much. I won't go on because I don't want to use too many more spoilers.This book was disappointing in too many ways to list, and the mages aren't as interesting as the Sunrunners. Only three stars"
5,What Is Going To Happen?!!,Am I the only one who cares what is going to happen with Gorsha and Casha? Forget Joss I want her to end up with Gorsha Calet is too hurt to have a relashonship wile she is alive but when she is doing that out of body thing she dose not have any truble being atracted to Gorsha!
3,Great Album!!,This CD was not what I was expecting......it did have a few songs I was looking for but it had a bunch of other songs I had never heard before. Overall it was a good cd and a great price for it.
2,Tough to enjoy,"As an old fan of hockey games I was excited for this to come out. After a little while of playing and completing a plethura of games played against friends, I realized this game wasn't for me and lacked the fun element. I felt like you could score at any time with a one-timer."
5,Did what I needed it to do.,"I'm in perimenopause and my period is irregular. When it was a LOT later than I thought it should be, I used this, in conjunction with Black Cohosh and Dong Quai, to get things moving again."
4,superman action figure,"My son loved this gift! I like the big size and fun sounds. The arms are a little awkward, but he doesn't seem to mind. I love that it has an OFF switch!! This is a good action figure for young children."
1,Great Starter Set...But,"This is a great starter set for anyone, but I did not receive the pipes for the pipe clamps. I can buy pipes of varying lengths for use with the pipe clamps at a hardware store, but if it's in the picture, I except to receive it.Poor rating is for misleading picture."
2,A Lesser Effort,"""They Walked Like Men"" is definitely one of Simak's less successful novels. I suggest readers try ""City,"" ""Way Station"" or ""Ring Around the Sun"" rather than read ""They Walked..."" I think they will be amply rewarded. ""City"" (really a connected series of short stories), ""Way Station"" and ""Ring Around the Sun"" are well blended science fiction and fantasy books, with clear prose, interesting ideas and sympathetic characters. They are Simak at his best."
1,Not available on Gamecube,"Well, if you had not seen it yet, the self-fulfilling prophecy is showing itself now for sure. Futurama just came out for PS2 and XBox, but the GCN version was canned. Why? Because Vivendi is discouraged by Nintendo's console's performance, and they don't want to risk losing money on a game published for it. One of the main reason the console is failing to live up to the standards set by PS2 and XBox is because the library is lacking. People will continue to steer away from the Gamecube if game publishers continue to ignore the console.Thumbs down to Vivendi Universal!!!"
1,Disappointing,"The movie started out with low quality and seemingly poor acting abilities. I gave it only one star because of the extremely foul language which is normally only found in rater ""R"" movies. This picture was not rated. My ""TV Guardian"" filter would not remove the offensive language. I didn't finish watching it as I try to watch morally uplifting movies in my home."
4,Futurama for the PS2,This plays like a game for the PS2 made from a TV adult humor cartoon.I just happen to really like the show so when I recently found this online I had to have a copy to play.
1,DON'T GET THIS GAME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"You Futurama fans think this is a dream come true, right.Wrong.On the 2nd level in the sewers it's impossible to beat if you run out of bullets because all you have is a hammer.Just don't get this game whatever you do belive me!"
2,Loses seal,Loses it's seal over a short time. One to three days in the frig. Quicker if you move it around a lot. Avoid this pull-seal design. The push button kind are much better. Cheap thin plastic.A ziplock bag is better than this.
2,Good if you know NOTHING about wedding planning only,"I bought this book a few weeks ago and very unhappy with it when it came. I was able to flip through the book and read all the information in about 15 minutes total. There was nothing new in that book that I didnt already know. And certainly nothing more than I could find for free on [...]. I can see that it may be helpful for someone who knows nothing about wedding planning, but not useful for the average woman. Instead, save your money and buy a binder with some dividers and head to [...]."
4,Great Source,This book is a great source of information. It is helping my sister plan and she is not good at planning ahead.
1,Same as any Bride's magazine,"I was disappointed with Beverly Clark's wedding planner almost as soon as I started looking at it. Sure the advice is sound, but it is the same as you'll find in any copy of Modern Bride, etc. In addition, lots of the advice is uninspired, common sense, and seems kind of dated and old-fashioned. The checklists aren't great either. I was hoping for more examples and creative wedding ideas.If you're looking for ideas, I would highly recommend three sources - Weddings, by Colin Cowie, which is a creative book with a great attitude and philosophy, and a visual feast with tons of amazing photos. Also check out Bridal Bargains, by Denise and Alan Fields, which is my favorite wedding book, and 100x more useful than this planner!! (both titles available through Amazon.com!)Congratulations and best of luck to everyone who's about to be married!"
2,"Sorry, no....","I know it's a popular title, but in our experience that's because there aren't a lot of useful titles out there, despite the profusion of publications. My bride-to-be and I were freaking over money and little issues, looking around for good books on the subject. We must have bought dozens and dumped a couple hundred bucks at least. We found the e-book ""How to Plan the Wedding You Really Want"" and put almost all the other books up for sale on half.com. It's a much better deal overall and funny, to boot."
1,This CD Does not Honor the Man's Memory,"I am a recent fan of Mike's electric blues playing, but this CD seems to be a collection of mainly 3rd rate acoustic material that would probably suit completists or be at home in a box set. All the hype about this disc seems way over the top when you actually listen to the music and I believe does not do the memory of Mike Bloomfield justice. I used to be a bit of a completist myself, but I now subscribe to the quality rather than quantity theory."
5,Stalking Wolf and Aurora's love.....,"Stalking wolf fell in love with Aurora, whose father murdered his mother...They are like sunshines for each other.... and yet their love is much more stronger and soulful.... a beautiful book that Kit Dee wrote... =) A great book that everyone should read =) I couldnt put it away so I stay up very late just to finish this book... =) and I just got myself my own copy of this book from the bookrack..*happy* well, all in all, this is a book that you will not deny to read it =)"
2,Too Noisy For Silent Films,"I was looking forward to this movie. The problem is, the sound man was deaf, so he mixed everything ""up front"" throughout the film. Great idea for a documentary. But at the beginning, the silent clips had a background piano which was not bad. However it also had a narrator who was mixed so far back that the music was louder than the announcer. And so it continued throughout the film...the narrator was mixed so far under the music that he was useless.I was really looking forward to this, but i had to skip through it. About fifteen minutes of that loud music mix was all I could take. Useless unless you like attempting to hear the announcer over the loud piano music.BAD, bad sound mix."
5,A truly freaky horror novel,"This is the first novel by Douglas Clegg that I have read, and it's, well, great. It's about a young couple fresh out of law school who move into an old townhouse in the D.C. suburbs. They slowly discover that the house has an evil past, and that their downstairs tenant is not who she seems to be. Lots of gore, like most good horror novels, after all, what could be more horrifying than a man driven so far into madness that he bashes himself to death with a hammer? But it also has a lot of really non-gory scares, too, for instance, the children in the park. Read it if you're a horror novel buff. It's much better than I expected."
1,Breeder review,"This book wasn't as great as I thought it was going to be. Reading each chapter, I found that the story was very predictable."
4,Not Really What I Was After,"I don't want to misrepresent as it is a very nice astronomy program. But, I was to understand that it could be dialed back to show the sky at various points in time and it can, just not as far as I was hoping it would."
5,All the Roadrunning,"What a paring!! Some things were just meant to be. Mark Knoffler is by far my favorite singer/songwriter . And his sensitivity and technique as a guitarist is second to none. I especially love his work since his Dire Straits dayz. And Emmy Lou??? what more can be said about her? This alblum is the best thing I've heard in years ,. Not a bad cut on it, it's continually on my jukebox!!!!!!!!"
3,Not as good as it should've been,"Mark & Emmy, two of my most favorite musical heroes. What happened? The collaboration is nice, some excellent pieces, but overall, a disappointment. I guess they were too intent upon keeping their styles apart rather than melding. Oh well, it's nice to know they tried and respect each other's talent, it should've worked."
3,all the roadrunning,emmy lou and mark are a perfect compliment to one another. should win awards for best mixed duo.
5,Outstanding Combination Of Exceptionally Talented Musicians,"Simply an awesome disc. Mark Knopfler is my favorite guitarist and has been for many years. His playing is like listenting to someone else use their voice, it's that expressive. I'm new to Emmylou Harris and very impressed. Just a great disc for any fan of good music."
3,Better efforts by both,"None of these titles will have you tapping ypur feet, but OK for soft background music while with company or working."
3,Not the best from either...,"... but ok. I was a little disappointed with the work, thought it would be more dynamic somehow. Neither seems to be contributing what it is that makes them so special individually."
4,You'll Like This if You Like Emmylou or Mark's Country Stuff,"Mark and Emmylou blend well together, and neither takes the spotlight. Don't expect Dire Strait's sound, as on other Mark Knopfler albums"
3,An enjoyable album.,"Aria is a good album from Asia. I find it to be respectable, melodious, and solid. Everyone of the songs are listenable and cohesive. The musicianship, songwriting, and production are tight. Geoff Downes does a nice job with the keyboard playing. The keyboards really do add a nice atmospheric quality to the tunes. John Payne is also a likeable vocalist, and Al Pitrelli does well with the guitar duties. The album is in a straight-ahead pop rock direction and is quite catchy. The songs that I like the most are ""Anytime,"" ""Enough's Enough,"" and ""Sad Situation."" I have always considered Aria to be a decent and enjoyable album from Asia. Roger Dean's album cover is also pretty nice. Aria is worth a listen."
5,absolutely tremendous,"i have been a fan of asia for quite some time now and have all their studio albums.this their fifth is easily the best one,it has melody goes at a good pace,and not like the earlier john wetton albums where the music was too blocky and disjointed.i have given this five stars because this is what the old asia should have sounded like.in my opinion steve howe though a fine guitarist ruined the first two albums.my favourite tracks are anytime,sad situation both you sing along to very loudly and feels like love with lyrics i can relate too.well done lads on a fine effort.i do prefer john wettons vocals,having seen him live but john payne though less vocally talented,rocks more and has more energy."
2,Just doesn't work the way you'd like,"Seemed like a good idea. Unfortunately it takes too much fiddling around to get it tight enough to work at all. You have to make sure it's lined up just right, and the thumb wheel doesn't allow you to tighten it that hard. The grippers have a little play in them which makes it worse. It's possible to use it, but not a lot of fun."
1,Damages nuts or bolts - do not buy,"I bought this wrench with a great interest from HomeDepot, but soon I discovered that this wrench was a junk. You can not use it on a nut/bolt, it slips and damages the nuts/bolts. I would not recommend this wrench to anybody! Total waste of money. I had to return it to HomeDepot."
2,Get it for the first track at least...,"I'm serious. Abstract Truth did quite a remix for ""get another plan"". Superb sounds...music that pushes you farther. Put this track in, get on the highway, and floor it! You won't be dissapointed. As far as the other go....well, frankly, it's a shame really you start out such a good cd and then blow it on the rest of the tracks. They just didn't hit it for me. Too repetitive, nothing new, not very dancable, some cases just annoying....it wasn't worth it. But hey, go to amazon uk or de and see if you can listen to the whole cd and decide for yourself."
4,easy to read,"easy to read, helpful excercises, a good book for those who want to learn C++ programing"
1,Horrible,I put a couple of apples into the hanging basket and the chain links broke immediately. Poor quality chains used and the overall feel of the basket mesh themselves were flimsy. Strongly advise against this product unless you are using it to hang cotton balls or tufts of facial tissues.
3,decent but not great,"I had such high hopes for this book. I loved the first half, written as Nora Roberts. It was funny, sexy, fast-paced, exciting and just great. The characters were lively and well thought out.Then I read the second half, the J.D. Robb story. It was a typical Eve Dallas tale and not bad as such. But the plot was obvious and I had the killer figured out from the beginning. It was too predictable and became boring quickly.An entertaining read, but not one of her best."
4,"Good story, but could use some character development","This was a good story, but it was wrapped up a little too neatly at the end of each half. The characters in the first half were well-developed, but I wanted to hear more about them in part 2. Nora Roberts'/JD Robb's trashy sex scenes were prominent in both stories. I started scanning these sections when that got old, as it usually does for me with her books.I really wanted to know more about Samantha in part 2. The villain in that half just made me want to slap him. Lots more character development could have been done.Overall, a good story, but predictable ending."
1,A Real Disappointment,"I have read most of Nora Robert's books and many of them have moved me to tears. Having said that, this book bored me to tears! In most of Robert's books the characters are carefully and lovingly created with adequate time given to get to know them, care for them and go on the journey with them. Nothing here of that caliber. Just a boring story about Eve Dallas (I've never read J.D. Robb and don't want to now) and her hardboiled character who seems robotic and unfeeling. I found no interest in the second half of the book but read it to the end and was glad to be done with it. I'll take the romantic and carefully developed characters of Nora Roberts' books and leave the J.D. Robb futuristic stuff for the people who enjoy it."
2,My last Robb/Roberts read . . .,"I give the first part of the story a 4 and a zero to the second - in fact, I didn't even finish the book - I simply didn't care what happened to them or the treasure. I enjoyed the first two characters -- Eve and Roarke bore me to tears - or at least, Eve does. I don't like female characters who flaunt the fact that they have bigger (you know whats) than the men in her world -- she's turning Roarke into a whimp! I've read 75% of Robert's books, but I think I'm through with Roberts/Robb - she's done her story formula to death."
2,Very disappointed.,"Ok, I got duped. A real Eve Dallas fan I decided to try this different book. Worked my way through the first half, not particularly enjoying it and then realized that I had already read the second half under the title of Big Jack by JD Robb."
2,Typical NYHC,"Review by Tyler Wagnon:Pride Kills plays straight up 90's style metallic NYHC with a bit of added melody and some decently varied tempos. If you are into Madball, you probably will like this, and they even do a few things throughout that bring to mind One Life Crew.The song writing is pretty typical of this style complete with faster metallic picking parts and some mid-paced chugging riffs. If it matters at all, members of Full Blown Chaos and My Luck pop up in a few places for addition vocals, but they sound basically the same so who cares.There's nothing wrong with Deep In The Heart, but it is pretty much just typical NYHC with very little working in the creativity department. If you need every single NYHC style album that ever comes out, then by all means, spend your hard earned money on this. Otherwise, go buy an old Earth Crisis album or something."
2,"There is no magic, only basics","Mr. Debelak has written a 'basic' marketing book; something you might read in a beginning marketing course. However, some of his information is out of date. When I started reading Marketing Magic I realized much of the infomation was common sense and didn't find any 'magic' that would make me want to continue reading. I skipped to certain sections hoping to find secrets or 'magic' information. I cite his information about trade shows. Unfortunately, it was out of date too.If you need a basic marketing book to cover introduction to business marketing, this would be the book to buy. If you have been in business and need more current information, continue your search."
3,Old stuff for a new time...,"The title of the book is great, but the contents are old. I was hoping to find 'magic', but all I got was the same information I learned in college. An example would be his information concerning trade shows. While the concept and premise are sound, the details of taking business cards, is old. There are so many innovations that obtaining leads at shows has become as simple as swiping a credit card. And he mentions not attending national shows, which is good advice in the beginning. But if you are going to ANY trade show, your booth should always look professional. It doesn't have to cost you thousands of dollars either, but a well groomed booth will attract more than a booth with a table and chair.The information contained in the book is good but, unless you have never taken any business classes or have worked in business before, find something else that truly is 'magic'."
3,strangely written. Informative but seemingly delusional,"She has a strange writing style and uses the wrong words here and there, for instance, she uses ""giddy"" to describe herself sobbing and suicidal. She switches back and forth a lot in her timeline and talks about a lot of people no one has ever heard of. There are also some typos. Its a small and easy read and fairly entertaining if you can overlook the weirdness of her expressions."
1,Sad representation of a great band,"What a joke. ""Live For Today"", really? Obviously Toto had nothing to do with this release. 10 songs from a band that at the time was around for 20 years and over 10 albums is very sad. There are better greatest hits discs in the Toto arsenal than this. Your best bet is to pick up Toto IV, Tambu, Fahrenheit, The Seventh One, XX, and Mindfields for a good cross section of Toto. This amazing band cannot be shoved into a 60 minute CD. It doesn't do them justice. While Rosanna, Africa and Hold the Line are obvious masterpieces, the lesser know hidden material (Tambu in particular) really reflect the talent and mastery of Toto."
3,Good read; not very believeable in places,"The feuding families struggle to be believeable in places and some of the storyline similarly tends to sretch believability in places too. But so saying, a pretty good read and definitely enjoyable. A good Dick Francis."
2,"great idea, wrong construction","1. its hard to connect the feeder hose inside the unit.2. watch your psi: i am sure mine is around 60psi but the otherend of the hose popped off because of the pressure. theinstructions say rated to 75psi.3. also when finished, the instructions say you could leaveit in the ""rest"" position, i say after that go down to rewindto let the pressure come out the exit hose.4. make sure you turn off the water altogether."
3,Customer Service Nil-Reel great when it works,"I purchased this model in May of 2004 and used it successfully through 2005. However, in April 2006 the housing filled with water when the hose was turned on. Numerous calls to Hydro Ind. were very unsatisfactory. I was told to replace the o-rings, which I did. I was told to check/replace all washers, which I did. One rep said he'd send a replacement part (the valve, I think)....none recieved. A second rep said the same...none received. Further calls were answered only by someone who said she'd pass on the information. E-mailing comments, after filling in all the information and clicking on ""submit"" come up with ""page not available"". I liked the way the reel worked but will certainly not replace it with another, as this company has absolutely no regard for customer satisfaction. Now, of course, the warranty has expired....I would have ignored the warranty and paid for the part....but their nonresponsiveness has depleted my patience."
2,BAD JOB,BAD JOBI thought Friday after next wasn't all that good. Ice Cube wasn't all as good then he was in the first Friday. He was more of a serious character in the movie. Mike Epps on the other hand was funny in both movies. If there weren't any Mike Epps in the movie wouldn't be funny. And the new character to the movie was micro mini pimp. He was a great character. That movie wasn't al up to I thought it would be. But if you want to see Mike Epps in action you would like to watch this movie.

5,The World of Shannara (The Original Shannara Trilogy),"I have found that this book contains details about much of the Shannara world that has only been hinted at or characters that were briefly introduced in his first series - Sword, Heritage, High Druid, Jerle Shannara... He also introduces us to the creatures and races that inhabit the world that Brook's created. He describes the locations of significance with great detail."
4,Informative,"Each of the six documentaries in this set is 47 minutes long. The series has to really simplify these Caesar's histories, but it does tell their their stories well. I found the scholarly contributions (comments from academics) informative. It is also well directed by Phil Grabsky. My only complaint is the lack of informative imagery to accompany the narration. The slow motion close-ups of classical buildings, paintings, sculpture, as well as sand, roads and sky are beautiful to look at, but they don't add anything to what we are being told. And I almost never knew what I was looking at. For example, was that really an ancient portrait bust of the person being discussed, or was that just a generic bust?"
3,"The sky is falling, the sky is falling","but so is the writing talent.This show has amazing cg, great animatronics, a few good actors, but I'm not sure if it's the writing or directing, but it gets bogged down in a kind of melodrama that would be better for a sci-fi-set soap opera.Noah Wylie pretty much holds not only the characters together, but the show. Without him, it'd be a total wast.Having said that, if you like Stargate SG-1, you'll love Falling Skies, as it has a similar ethos."
5,Good Series,"I like a lot the series Falling skies. the story is very good with a lot of action, . there is a lot of personal stories inside the main drama. I recommend the series to anyone"
1,Almost as good as the bad movies on the SyFy channel,"the walkind dead is the new gold standard for post apocalyptic sci-fi. I am afraid this show just does not cut it. There's just too much mindless chatter, chessy dialogues and just too slow to hold my attention. I'll admit that I've just seen a few episodes and I hope its gets better but I am not holding my breath"
2,Not so good,"The plot is pretty bad and the acting as well. There are a few good characters sprinkled about the show and that kept my interest up until the sixth episode, but then I had to give up. There are some really big holes in the plot and the military guys in the show are pretty silly. Nothing adds up and its pretty boring so I'm finished with it."
2,Falling Skies,This series was just OK until I realized it was a remake of Red Dawn. Yuck. I'm not a fan of guns or the NRA.
2,"Should have titled it ""Falling Eyelids""","The first episode was just way too tedious. I thought I was watching one of those bad, made-for-SyFy movies, except a lot of them don't seem to take themselves as seriously as this did--the petty, high school drama and wooden acting made me think the Earth deserved to be taken over by aliens--I was thinking, all they need to do to defeat the skitters is to make them watch this show--they'd they'd either die of boredom or pack everything up and zoom back off into space to find some other another planet where they haven't invented TV yet. So why did I give 2 stars instead of one--my hand slipped."
5,Nice to get first seasons downloaded,"I miss many shows when they are first aired, but it's great to be able to go back to the first season of a series like Falling Skies when I belatedly discover them."
4,show,go a chance to see it on TV......... Prime Let me watch the 1st season in 1 day and it was awesome.
1,Really horrible and completely implausible,"I found Falling Skies to be boring and completely implausible. Falling Skies is full of bad science and a terribly crafted narrative. The technology, tactics, and motives that the aliens use is laughable. Falling Skies is like watching an episode of 1960s Doctor Who without The Doctor or the Tardis."
4,Great character development,"Really like the character development. Not a lot of action, but when things happen they are unexpected and due to the development, I genuinely cared about the people. Unlike other sci-if attempts that rely on effects and neglect the details."
2,Boring and poor production,"The series is no where a match for other programs on cable or network TV. The production of this series is horrible and cheap. The special effects looks like out of the 80's and the acting is sub-par. Too bad, the actors are well known and mostly good...I would blame this on the director, budget and the production."
5,Awesome Fun,"Falling skies is a great show with plenty of suspense, central family values and a moral backbone! From the beginning, building to the end, the show captures your attention and makes you attached to every character."
3,Mediocre,"Great idea, poorly executed... Example, aliens advanced enough to get here, but they can't spot multiple ""campfires"" at the refugees hideout. Nor can they see a large convoy driving down the road with their lights on. Even we have infrared/night vision tech..."
4,Post Apocalyptic Bullseye,"Show me anything with a post apocalyptic theme and I'm hooked. I thoroughly enjoyed this. Of course, there are always small inconsistencies in any science fiction stories. Just let it go and enjoy!"
3,Hope it gets better,Still watching Season I. I'm told the series does get better so I'll stick with it. It does have some twists and turns (some of which I think I've guessed already).
5,Give it a try,I really enjoyed watching this show. I was surprised how much I liked it because I'm not usually a sci-fi fan.
5,liked it.,Falling Skies season one was much better than I expected. I am not a big fan of Noah Wyle but he does a great job in this series.
5,Fun show,My Mom referred me to this show and I loved it. It was just a fun show. Good stories and good action.
5,It keeps getting better.,"At first I thought it was going to be the same old story, but this show does have some great potential. Near the end of the first season is when I got really hooked and I can't get enough now. I would recommend this show to anyone that is really into alien/apocalyptic series."
5,Addicted,I started watching it on a fluke and can't stop. I love the storyline and Noah Wyle is better than ever.
2,falling skies-review,This was kind of a let down. I expected more from a Stephen Speilberg event. It was just a typical alien vs. human drama. Wish there had been more of a unique plot. Tiresome
4,Entertaining,"Overall, this series is well made. Noah Wiley does a good job and the supporting characters are good as well. I have enjoyed this series."
4,Worth the Hassle,"It may be a hassle to spend time each night applying this whitening paste on your teeth every night. It may not taste good or feel comfortable when you wake up. However I would much rather take the time to apply this and go to sleep than sitting around for say 20 minutes with trays in my mouth with a gel that burns your gums. It DOES whiten your teeth. After a few days, I was already getting compliments.To make application a little easier: I took a small amount of tissue and packed my gums. This separated the lip from the teeth so that you didn't have to keep wiping the teeth. It looks silly, but who's going to see you? You've bought the kit to use at night for a reason. As soon as you apply the gel and you feel like it's dried, take the stuffing out. It's a lot easier than qiping each tooth as you go along and doing them all at once makes it easier to apply even coats to the teeth."
4,Mod Rod,Leaving Faces to go solo was not quite as crazy as it once seemed. This collections establishes the basis for why we love the vocals of a man you my wife says sounds like an old black woman.
2,Not Good!,"It is small and compact but it can give you a very bad picture sometimes and a fairly good one other times. If you can afford something better, go for it!"
2,Don't bother,"I had a previous Largan Chameleon and it was great. Couldn't take a bad picture with it. This one is the Largan Chameleon Mega and silly me to think this would be the next one up in quality. It's WORSE and it cost more! I can't take a decent picture with this thing for anything and giving it to a young child to use is a joke too because the pictures all come out brown, orange, or just plain dark."
4,Okay,"The speakers work okay, but are really meant for the specific TV they can be attached to, but the stands work too."
2,Just another Beatles cover,There is nothing special here. Certainly nothing approaching Bossa Nova.Stick with the real thing. No need to detour.
3,"Collection, not an Introduction","I am interested in Tomine's work as I have seen examples everywhere, so I got this book. It did confirm works that I suspected were his, such as the Weezer Posters, areas that I knew his work before like the New Yorker Illustrations, and describe the origin of some of his more reproduced works. That said, I would not recomend it as a way to get into the more personal work of Tomine. The best parts of the book are a collection of pre-Optic Nerve comics, one of which occurs twice, the second time naming names."
4,Easy to follow directs on how to build a web site.,"Just when I was about to give up, ""The Complete Small Business Internet Guide"" threw out the safety net! Everything you need to know, and easy to follow directions on how to do it, are right there in one book. It really is ""complete"". And, I appreciated the enclosed disk which let me cut and paste a lot of the solutions right onto my Web page design."
5,Massive,"After a brief introduction from airy chords and a Ghost in the Shell sample, Dieselboy lays it down hard. If Ed Rush and Optical's mix of Mindscan doesn't set the attitude for a blistering beatdown of drums, I don't know what does. The mix does not disappoint, with Dieselboy's signature sound refined even further.For those who found that A Soldier's Story lacked a little bass, fear not, you can happily terrorize a neighborhood with this one.Notable highlights would have to be the Side Effects remix, Jonny L's selecta, Facs & B-Key's Antics (which has a similar feel to Vertigo's Drained from Soldier's Story), and Decoder's Road Rage.A solid stormer, with positively huge sound."
3,Juicy jams,"3 1/2Powerful summation of the groups signature drip-jams at mid-90's healthiness, validating the eclectic players as key musicians in the modern jam-prog scene, if not removing their drug-induced stigma of trance-driven, effects-heavy party music."
5,ozric tentacles,"The Ozric Tenbtacles is one of the best bands ever! I can never get sick of listening too em. There was never one album that was a bit disappointed.Anyway the band isn't for everybody...but if your into any music thats progressive or psychedelic then you probably will like this band or any nature music as well too.Some of the ozric's band members also do Eat static, ZubZub, etc.I always liked this band sense late 1990's.An too me I think the band sounds like a little like nature music an also progressive an psychedelic, like ambient, dub, some of it sounds like techno music too.Like remember this band isn't for everybody...because its instrumental music an they do mixture of different genre's too like rock, ambient, psychedelic, techno, etc.Most people perfer regular music not music like this.An if you like this band then you'll also probably like Porcupine Tree, Hawkwind, Steve Hillage, etc."
3,I think the bookwas good and very interesting.,I read the book Where The Red Fern Grows.It was book that was very well written.I think that Wilson Rawls was so in touch with his book.It is so life like and feels so real. I would and do recomend this book to all my friends.
2,"The Review of ""Where the Red Fern Grows""",This book was okay but it was like any other dog book. It has the same plot as lots of books. A boy named Billy saves up his money to buy a pair of dogs. It takes him two years to save up $50. He trains the dogs to hunt coons and then enters a contest to see who has the best coon hunting dogs in the country. The grand prize is a golden cup and a money pot. Read the book to see what happens...W.M.
3,Where the Red Fern Grows,"The book ""Where the Red Fern Grows"" is an okay book. The one thing that I really enjoyed about the book was that it was predictable and unpredictable at the same time. Sometimes I thought I knew what was going to happen but then all of a sudden something totally different happens. This is a good thing to have in a book. One thing that I didn't like about the book was that in some parts nothing exciting was happening and other parts were jam packed with excitement. The action should be spread out more evenly, in order to matain the readers intrest.-Isabel"
4,What? you only recommend to boys?!,"This book was awesome. I am a girl and I really like it. I think that this would be a great book for ANYONE. you will like this book if you like suspense, mystery, and a little drama all in one book. I recommmednd this to ALL people. girls just as much as guys."
2,where the red fern grows,"This book is a pretty good book for a boy my age.the reason I rated this book 2 stars is because I have read better books but,Where The Red Fern Grows is still a pretty good book. Watch Out!!! there are some sad parts"
2,This Book Could Not Be Published Now,"I re-read this one about a month ago. I had read it about 12 years ago and was pretty much turned off by the blatant animal cruelty. I know people hunt and eat raccoons and harvest their fur, but the very graphic descriptions of treeing a coon and having the dogs tear it up, plus raccoons left in leg traps for days was awful. Then there is the gory wounding (disembowelment!) of the protaganist's dog by a mountain lion at the end and both dogs die. Watching the Animal Cops shows on Animal Planet now and seeing the extent of animal cruelty perpetrated by humans, why read about more of it?These days with animal protection movements I don't think this story would have had a prayer in the publishing houses, much less become a classic. If you love dogs and animals in general, steer clear of this one."
3,Fading,"The product does a good job overall, but it would be helpful to have the chapters identified as the reader speaks and on the cd. Also, the reader's voice fades in and out at weird times and sometimes it is hard to hear."
4,The Boy And His Hounds,"Billy has never really liked dogs. Until he ends up saving one! Ever since Billy helps an old pooch, he catches puppy love. To make it plain and simple, Billy wants dogs. But not just any dogs. He wanted hunting hounds. Billy works for 2 years to pay for his dogs. Their names are Old Dan and Little Ann. Every night in the mountainside, Billy, Old Dan, and Little Ann have fun hunting. Billy loves his hounds but, will he sacrifice his life to save them? Read ""Where The Red Fern Grows"" by Walter Ralls, and find out the secret of the sacred red fern.""Where The Red Fern Grows"" is a good example of caring. Through out the book, Billy is always caring more for his hounds than being selfish, and only caring about him self. Billy was dead set on getting his dogs, even though he worked for 2 years to get them. Billy never lost hope in getting his pups. I recommend this book to adventurous readers who like long books."
4,Where the Red Fern Grows,"This story is about a boy and his adventures with two dogs. It takes place during the Depression years. Most people were poor then, and Billy worked hard to get the money to buy his hunting dogs. He trained his dogs to be two of the best coon hounds in the region. The story is exciting and teaches a good lesson about hard work, love, and devotion."
5,Where The Red Fern Grow touched my heart!,Where the Red Fern Grows is a beautiful story. The story has excellent descriptions. The Ozarks seem like a beautiful place to live. It just shows how much effort one little boy put in to buy his hunting hounds. The end of the book made me cried. Where the red fern grow is the best book I ever read. I don't think anybody could dislike this book. Wilson Rawls is an excellent author.
5,fantastic!,I remember reading this book for the 1st time when i was in 3rd grade and after i finished it bawling my eyes out. It still does the same thing reading it at 21. Great book.
3,A ok reader!,"If I had just five words to explain the book I would probley say "" The Movie is much better"" If some one ask me ""should I read this book?"" I would probley don't waist your time. I mean it was O.K."
5,The Best Book I Ever Read!,"I read this book after I watched the movie. It is about a boy, Billy and his coonhounds, Little Ann and Old Dan.Billy buys 2 coonhound pups for $40. He trains them and they go hunting alot. Billy and his coonhounds go to a Coon Hunt and win. With the money, they plan to move so the kids could get a better education. With the days numbered, Billy goes hunting with his dogs everytime his schoolwork was done. But on one hunt they meet a mountain lion. Old Dan is killed and Little Ann later dies by being heartbroken. Before they move Billy goes back to where his dogs were buried, and then he finds a red fern growing between them. It is said only an angel can plant a red fern and that spot would be sacered forever.This story is sad, but I enjoyed it very well. It is my favorite book and that most likely always will."
4,a touching story,the book where the red fern gorws is an exiciting book. the kind of book that makes you want to never stop turning the pages. this book didn't make me cry (although others in my class did) but it did make me wonder and be filled with excitement. i really enjoyed the book where the red fern grows. and i think everyone should have a chance to read this bookkamilah
5,Where the Red Fern Grows,It's about a boy named Billy who finds a sports magazine at a fishermens camp and sees an add in there that selling hounds for 25 dollars each. He wanted two of them he asked his parents but they didn't have the money so he worked all summer and finally got enough 2 years later and there was still hounds available so he bought them but the owner dropped the price so he got 10 dollars back and then he went to Kentucky where he could locate his pups on the way back he go a little beat up but then somebody helped him and gave him his first can of soda pop. When he got home he trained his dogs after that they were capturing coons like a snap except they kept treeing them instead I recomend this book a lot.
1,Where the Red Ferns doesn't grow: by ROCKER CHIC,"I really hated this story. I really don't like old people books. I like fantasy-adventure books. I also HATE red hounds. All they do is bark, eat, and sleep. Billy was a baby. He cried in like every chapter. The book might have been slightly good if I didn't hate red hounds so much."
5,A Great Book,"I really liked WTRFG.I liked this book because dogs are my favorite animals and it has two great coon hunting dogs.Another reason I liked the book is because Billy takes on a lot of challenges and adventures.The literary element I thought the auther handled best was imagery because he used good details and words to make you picture what was going on in the story.this book made me think about how much I wanted a dog when I was little.I would recommend this book to a friend because it is a book ful of lessons that have been learned and it is a wonderful interesting book to read. It is sad and it will fill your eyes with tears, but it is a really great book.You must read this book."
5,You will have red eyes when you finish this one!,"I first read this book back in the sixties, after my brother told me about his teacher reading it in class, and nearly everybody crying at the end. It really is an emotional ending! The book itself is very well written, and Wilson Rawls does an excellent job of drawing the reader into the story. It's an excellent story for young people, and you won't regret taking the time to read it. But you will also have a tough time holding back tears at the end. Trust me on this."
5,LITTLE ANN AND OLD DAN,"This book was the 1st book that I didn't want to throw out the door.This book is about a boy that lives in the Ozarks.His name is Billy and he really wants hunting dogs BAD.So then he deside's to ask his parents.They tell Billy, they don't have enough money. So Billy works 2 years for $50 to buy 2 hounds.He spends time training them to be the best coon dogs around.Why I say the best coon dog's around because they win a gold cup, silver cup and $300.Then the unexpected happened, the pups were severely hurt.Old Dan dies, then Little Ann cant stand it with out him.So she dies soon after Dan.A Red Fern grows in between there grave's.A Red Fern is planted by an angel. It means the land is sacred.When I read this book I cried!I love this book it's now my favorite book. Thanks to my teacher for picking this book for my class to read.5HRB"
5,Book gives a perfect picture of what it's trying to tell,"This is the best book I have ever read in my life, it actually paints a picture in your mind because Wilson Rawls is so descriptive. This book is very heartwarming, sad, and a very intense book about a boy his to hounds with hunts that you won't forget. You must read this book - it's great!"
5,Where The Red Fern Grows,I like this book because it is about animals in particular it is about coon dogs. The little boy saved up 40 dollars to but two dogs. I think others would be interested in this book because it about this boy gets two dogs and tries to turn then in to coon dogs. He trains them and takes them out and he got his first coon. He's has the best dogs in the county and has the most coon skins. Some kids made a bet with Billy he took the bet. Billy tried to tell them he won the bet but they started to fight and it didn't end well. You are going to have o read the book to find out more about the book.
2,A book that I didn't like,"Where the Red Fern Grows is a poor book, in my opinion. It was okay the first time I read it in the 4th grade, but now in the 7th grade when I read it, I didn't like it. It wasn't really intressting, exept for the parts when Billy and his dogs went hunting. I really didn't like the part of the book when both dogs died, just like that. Then the family cried a little bit and the next Spring they didn't really act like they were sad. I didn't think that was very realistic."
2,Book is great but prints is one of the worst,"The book is worth reading, no doubt about that. I gave this a 2-star only because I am thoroughly disappointed in how small the prints are for a young child to read. It looks like that someone copied the smaller book (one of those pocket size book) onto the bigger pages and it is all towards the center of the binding, kind of hard to read for a young child. If I had bought this book at a local bookstore, I would have returned and tried a different edition."
4,Where the Red Fern Grows/ kids review.,1)Question:Why did Billy have dog-wanting disease?Answer:Because he wanted to go hunting really bad and he didn't have any dogs or hounds to go hunting with.2)Question:Why did Billy's Grandpa give Billy back $10.00?Answer:Because the price of the dogs had gone down.3)Question:If the author were too go back to Old Dan and Little Ann's grave; what do think he would see?Answer:He would probably see the beautiful Red Fern.4)Question:What is the legend of the red fern?Answer:The legend of the red fern is that there was once a brother and sister and there love for each other and one day they got lost with each other out in the woods and they kept each other company; and one day they died and a red fern grew between their graves. And now the red fern is sacred.5)Question:What is the foreshadowing of the story of Where the Red Fern Grows?Answer:Billy will probably return too the two little graves with the beautiful red fern growing between them.
3,The Red Fren Review,I just finished the book and I don't really like it because the book you can predict what happens in every chapter and also you Billy cries in every chapter he cries. HE IS SUCH A BABY! Most of my L.A. class doesn't like the book!P.S. NO OFFENSE TO ANYONE WHO LIKES THE BOOK OR THE AUTHOR AND PEOPLE THAT WORKED ON THE BOOK!
5,A Good Reason To Read! : ),"Where The Reed Fern Grows is the best book that I have everread. It's good if you need a little cry and even if you need a littlelaugh. It's the story of a boy and two dogs and the boy, Billy saves up his OWN money for two years for these dogs and he can't think God any more than what great dogs he got.I would tell you the end but it would ruin the whole story. It's a great book! THANKS :)"
5,Where wood chips fly and things die,I like the book because when ever I got board something awsome happend. For example when I lost intrest the pups would find a coon.
5,I thought the book was very detailed and realistic.,"The called Where the Red Fern Grows is a very amazing book about a young boy and his two dogs. His dogs names were Little Ann and Big Dan, they played a very important role in the story because they influenced the decisions made by the main character and his family members. To conclude, I thought this book was very well-written and kept my interest through-out the whole story!"
3,A Childhood Favorite,Another favorite read from my childhood. A sad tale of love and friendship between a boy and his dogs. This one will pull at your heart strings for sure.
5,Great inspiring story about a boy and his dogs.,"This story was a great story, I read this story in 5th grade and thought it was great .I recomend this book to any one that absoutley loves dogs"
4,Great Book!,"This book was one of the greatest books I have ever read! It gave me perfect vision of what happened. At the beggining the main character of this book, Billy, wanted two coon-hunting dogs and he had to work hard labor for two years to get enough money to buy them. He trained them until they were the best coon-hunting hounds ever! He entered them in a contest and won. The ending was very surprising, but that's for you to read!JH"
5,A terrific book for old and young,"One of my son's high-school teachers recommended this book, not as an assignment--just as a great read. Boy, was he right. I do not normally read fiction, and especially not sad doggie tales, but this is the ultimate exception. There are so many wonderful lessons for adults and kids to be gleaned from this book, and I wish that there were more like it instead of a lot of the trash that is available to our youths today.One reviewer complained that it was a ""hick"" book, and it is; but it is still well worth the read and I would put it against many of the more popular literary works for it's lessons in perseverance, decency, intestinal fortitude, and simple entertainment value. ."
5,Great story,"In my opinion, this is one of the greatest children's story ever written. This story was read to my sixth grade class by our home room teacher. Once it was finished, I read it again on my own. It is the one book I have never forgotten over the years. I bought it to read to my son."
2,Stick with regular hearing protection,"I test fire firearms for a living and thought I would try these. For indoor use they are just too thin to cut noise to an acceptable level. The electronics work ok, but the muffs themselves are too slimline with just plastic and a thin layer of foam inside to cut down the sound. The noise from handguns is bearable but rifles and shotguns are uncomfortable. Outdoor shooting may be better but unless you really need to hear your surroundings (such as hunting or training) I recommend a cheaper set of regular ear muffs."
1,Very frustrating,"I have found this dictionary very frustrating in that I cannot find even common words in it or that the definition given is not the most common one. As a new Spanish student, I will use this dictionary first because it is lightweight and portable, but constantly I end up using my desktop dictionary because this one didn't have what I was looking for. I am ready to toss it and buy a different pocket version."
1,junk,Bought one when they first came out. It was junk after the first year. Bought another one last year which was suppose to been upgraded and had the same results after one year. They are junk!
2,"Thanks Phil, but Tarzan so much better","I love Phil Collins and was hoping this CD would have the same magic that Tarzan had. But, alas I am very disappointed. The only really good song on the entire CD is ""On My Way"". The rest are only so so. Not much use of Phil's fabulous drums that attract me so much to Phil's music. Sorry, but I can't recommend you go out and buy this one even if you are a big Collins/Genesis fan and are starving for more of their great work."
4,crusade pianist,This item arrived ahead of time and as described. My husband is pianist at our church and has played out of this book just last Sunday. He received many favourable comments on the arrangement he played and he is already practicing other pieces.Crusade Pianist
5,Braving the Waves: Rockaway Rises -- And Rises Again,"If you have avoided books on this subject and feel it is time to read about 9/11. This is the book.On a day when Americans were murdered at a level never seen in our history, one neighborhood carried far more than they deserved. Only to have disaster strike again, this time in their backyard.Who would think it possible to feel good about such a sad story? Kevin Boyle did just that with this book. Everyone who loves New York/America should read this book."
3,rooferwayne,"I bought this cd thinking it was the fine metal band UDO. This is some soft rock cover tune style cd, it not bad for that kind of stuff, be warned."
4,A Terrific Novel,"The first rule of fiction is to be true to the characters and let the story flow from them. While a lot of science fiction focuses on ideas to the detriment of characterization, Holy Fire works really hard to be true to its characters, especially Mia/Maya. The ideas are there too, as they always are in Sterling, but the flow naturally from the story. A terrific book."
2,Not so tuff for aggressive chewers,"I have trouble finding toys that my 4 year old chocolate lab won't chew up right away. I was encouraged that this toy was labeled as ""durable"" and it was supposed to entertain your pooch for ""hours"". Sadly, my dog was really excited about the toy but she was able to start tearing off chunks of it in just about 15 minutes (at which time I had to take it away from her). So, this toy is definitely not for aggressive chewers."
5,Great Bible for babies and toddlers.,This is a wonderful resource for Bible stories for very young children. The DVD also reads the book and has interactive questions as well. It has a section of songs and a section of prayers too. It is INCREDIBLE. I highly recommend it. My 3 month old granddaughter was caught by the DVD's beautiful colors and the voice used to narrate.
3,Not Hi8 nor 8mm compatible! Be careful!,"I wonder if more buyers had the same issue, maybe I misread the information available, but this camera is NOT compabile with the Hi8 nor 8mm formats. You can use tape with Hi8 and 8mm specs., but you CANNOT PLAYBACK any Hi8 nor 8mm tapes with this Digital8 camcorder. Be careful about it!"
2,Missing Item,"One item was missing from the set, the AV connecting cable for Stereo. Hope you can send the item to my address soon."
3,Hi8,You can only play Hi8 tapes if they were recoreded on this model--so don't pick this one if you want something that can play your old Hi8 tapes and give a digital output.
1,Not good for playing old S-Video Tapes,"I bought this to play back old Hi8 tapes so I could transfer them to DVD. However, there is no S-Video out and no stereo out. Video quality was bad: output was noisey and reds were over saturated. I imagine this is because there is no S-Video out. I returned it and have ordered a Sony GV-D200. Hopefully it will give me better quality since it was more than twice as much. There are some cheaper used options available, e.g. Sony EVO-250."
4,DVD burning is easy and cheap,"Like other reviewers, I bought this SONY after my old machine refused to play back my antique but loved tapes. I was shocked at all the DVD complaints I read here.Although I like to edit tapes on my computer, its a job or two sometimes. I burn DVD easily in real time with a free-standing Sansung DVD burner that cost me 100 dollars. Its got a list of about 125 or so. At the time I bought it at Fry's, and loved it so much I got another a few weeks later. ALl you do next is get Audio and video out from the itty bitty combo plug, and then use the round rca plugs to go to the burner. Yes, a totally free standing burner. Plug it in, and go to the bathroom or what-ever. Automatic performance once started!!!! Now I also use this burner to record TV shows and such. Its like a VCR for DVD media.I use this for several formats of video. Now I am sure there is a loss of quality, but it does an excellent job of video transfer. FAR superior to recording to VHS tape."
4,Stirred...,"Not as good as ""Funk The System,"" but good nonetheless. Whereas ""Funk The System"" goes from funky to techy, here DJ Dan seems to have found a half-way point between that funk and tech and combined it, spreading both evenly over this mix. This is by no means bad -- the tracks are wicked and make me move, but it lacks the surprise that ""Funk The System"" had with its smooth transition from funk to tech. All in all, recommended (especially if you are already familiar with DJ Dan), but pick up ""Funk The System"" first.Anyway... The stand-out tracks are ""Dr. Funk"", the ""Making Me Feel / Rise / Funk Master"" mix, and ""White Treble, Black Bass."" Sadly though, DJ Dan uses CZR's somewhat weak remix of ""Rise."" It's used well here, but Eddie Amador's track has much better mixes..."
1,Amazon.com is Irresponsible,"I ordered these. They came in a cardboard box with NO PADDING. They shattered. I asked for replacements and asked them to pad them. Those ALSO shattered because they weren't padded. The third time I called they said they can't promised they'd be padded and gave me a refund! I still want these, but they won't send them again because they can't tell the shipping people to pad them. Ridiculous."
3,not what i thought,this is ok but seems very random and nonlinear. a little too chaotic for my taste but the concert footage is excellant.
2,VERY DISAPPOINTING!!,"This is not the strongest chillout comp CD on the Water Music Records label...in fact, it's very lackluster, delivering very uninteresting songs, save the At-Jazz remix opener ""Not Just Anybody"" by Rae and Christian and the swanky-stanky ""Cafe Coca"" by De-Phazz. Once again, the ubiquitous ""Trinity"" song rears its ugly head on ""Midnight Lounge""...only this time, the song is remixed by personal fave of mine, PFL. However, not even his dubbish-flair makes the song anymore interesting, nor saves the chillout CD from the depths of total musical oblivion. A waste of money...burn it from a friend if they own it."
5,A DEFINITE INSTRUCTION MANUAL FOR STRING REPAIR,"Along with ""Violin Making"" and ""Cello Making"" this book is a needed instruction manual for those who work to repair string instruments. NOT FOR BEGINNERS, one must have knowledge of woodworking as well as basic construction of string instruments. The series has many different books to choose from but this is a definite one needed for your reference library."
2,Not very secure,"I did not find this item to keep the computer very secure . to many sides are open and it does not hold the computer in place. In addition I am looking for something with a closed top so that no dust , or dirt can enter . Also if it were somehow attached to the case it would be less likey to fall out too.Not a very smart case"
5,"Great ideas, wonderful resource","This book is really good. It give practical, helpful, SIMPLE methods to improve your home school. As well as the actual ideas, it gives a thorough description of different disorder types. This book gave me a LOT of encouragement, that I wasn't the ""only"" one out there with these issues. I kept thinking ""Yep, I've seen that"" and ""Yep, I can totally relate!"" I've implemented some of the suggestions and keep the book, with highlighted portions, close by."
2,Christian Perspective Pervasive Throughout,"I would not have bought this book if I knew that Christine Field is so incredibly religious. I specifically looked around the internet to find out if the book was written from a Christian perspective, couldn't find a word mentioning God or Christianity, and I thought I was buying a book written objectively. Boy am I sorry I'm stuck trudging through the God this and God that sections to get to anything worth reading. This might be a great book for someone who leans on God for inspiration. It's not the book for me, and I probably won't have the stomach to finish it."
1,Simply doesn't work,"I thought this water-powered hose reel would save a lot of bending and give my back a break. Right from the start, though, I could not get a tight seal. More water leaked from the various connection points than came out of the end of my hose. Although the water-powered rewind worked - in a dinky, achingly slow fashion - the reel wasted so much water and required so much fiddling I returned it within a few days."
4,Quality product,"Everything I expected from DW, a quality product from a quality manufacturer. I'll have this one for a long time, I'm sure!"
2,Not a good purchase,"All the techniques were virtually the same. There were just variation of the same techniques repeated to many times. These techniques are good, but the DVD is pretty limited in his explanations. The good point is that you will know their name in Chinese... but the rest of the DVD does not worth the price."
1,I GOT TAKEN!!!,Worst product on the market! A huge disappointment. I was very careful to use as directed. The result? One big mess! The lens were smeared and foggy with bubbles in them and I had no choice but to throw them away.
4,Still Awaiting The Ultimate Tribute To Brian,"A wonderful tribute to the great song writing skill of Brian Wilson, as well as several lesser known contributions from other band members, but I'm still waiting for the ultimate Brian Wilson tribute album, that would be ""Paul McCartney Sings The Songs Of Brian Wilson"". How 'bout it Sir Paul?"
1,junk,"Great features and great technology but as usual with Sony, it's junk. Sony products just don't last. I had mine for one year. Needs video head now. 264 dollars to repair. Previous Sony camcorder stopped ejecting tapes after one year. 185 dollars to repair. If you buy Sony, you better get the extended warranty. Dealers won't stand behind what they sell if it's out of warranty. They know it's junk. I have learned my lesson. No more Sony products."
1,Sony Junk,"I bought the TRV480 a little over a year ago and once again started getting the C:31:22 and C:21:00 errors same as I had gotten on my previous Hi8 TRV120. Apparently, a problem with the moisture sensor (I live in dry, non-humid California). Being out of warranty, it's $141.00 flat rate to ship out and get repaired. This is inexcusable to have the same kind of problem within 5 years on two different Sony products. Never again. I bought this camera to digitize my old Hi8 tapes. Problem was I kept taking new movies with it...and have a backlog of new tapes. Now it's either eBay time or bend over and pay Sony $141.00 to digitize those tapes. When the camera is working it's fine. But, for new filming, I will look elsewhere for my next camcorder--likely a Canon or Panasonic but never again with Sony."
3,Fresh and Interesting Ideas if you have lots of time,"I was so excited when I got this cookbook, but I had no idea what was in store for me....I think the average recipe takes about 3 hours to prepare. Many of the the recipes call for two master recipes which take an average of an hour. I tried to make the the Meat Broth master recipe...it took 2 days. Try to find 10 pounds of veal bones in one day....It took the store 3 days to save enough for me. The cooking techniques are not that difficult but most of the time will be gathering all the ingredients. I don't recommend this cookbook for anyone that does not live in a metropolitan area because you will not be able to find certain things and he doens't really suggest substitutions."
4,Did you ever wonder what happened to Victor Bergman?,"Fans of Space: 1999 will recall the major changes that occurred between season one and season two. Some of new things, as well as the absent things in season two were never explained. The most conspicuous change was the absence of Alpha's Science Officer, Victor Bergman. This novel explains the rest of the story and provides us with some clues to his fate.Ball writes a great story which at times makes you feel like you are watching the show again."
2,misses the mark,"I'm a Buddhist, an international 3rd world traveler and I love travel writing. I thought I'd love this book and was very disappointed. The author should have taken the time to develop some Buddhist practice before launching into inaccurate intellectual Buddhist psycho babble. If you want to write about Buddhism, close the books and develop a mediation practice....everything else misses the mark. Without that perspective the book is boring."
5,thanks for the order,this cd brung back memories it was a good cd. No scratches or anything. Thanks for doing business with me
5,Infant Car Seat Adapter,"This adapter is ideal for me and my husband, since we did not want to buy a travel system and second jogging stroller. With this easy adapter, we can use the BOB Revolution for our all around town stroller and our jogging stroller. We recommend it for anyone that does not want to buy multiple strollers."
2,pc ram,Had to return product because it would not work in my PC. Seller anb Amazon were both very courteous in sending me a quick refund for this item.
2,Be Careful!,More memory is not better. This card does not work in most of our computers. It's too big! Didn't work in some Celeron and Athlon computers. Try the 256K instead.
5,Contains the single most monumental vocal performance ever.,"Quite simply, the title track will make your hair stand on end. Think of Aretha Franklin crossed with the ""River Deep, Mountain High""-era Tina Turner, and then multiply your conception by 10. You still won't have come close to imagining Ellison's power and expressiveness. On technical terms, her performance is breathtaking. As emotional expression, it is nothing less than ravishing; it sounds as though her heart is being torn out of her while she sings. Frankly, the rest of her recorded work is pretty lukewarm, but for ""Stay With Me"" alone, you absolutely have to hear this."
2,A toy,"I was disappointed in the quality of this kit. Al the tools for picture framing are there - but the precision that even a hobbyist like myself desires is not. I going to give this miter device another try or two to see if my skills improve, but my first project was turned to junk by inexact miter cuts."
5,Love those deviled eggs,"At Easter, we never have enough room for all the deviled eggs so this plate was a great addition to my existing one!"
1,the fast and the furious,there is not much to be said or that hasn't already been said about this non stop pulse hiking movie. i have always enjoyed action films but this is the one to own if you never buy an action movie again. vin is believable and really makes the movie watchable.
5,Fast & Furious,"I figured after the last movie that this one would be boring. It was everything except boring. It's wild and so much action. I loved this movie just as much as the others. Now I have the whole set and all are good to watch over and over. If you don't like action movies, don't buy this one."
5,It delivers,Y'knahmsayin? (Do You Know What I'm Saying?) Y'knahmean? (Do You Know What I Mean?)Y'knahmsayin? (Do You Know What I'm Saying?) Y'knahmean? (Do You Know What I Mean?)This movie delivers. I was late to the series. The 1st one was ok to me and I didn't see another one until fast 5. That one hooked me to go back and watch them all. This one starts and end on a pure adrenaline rush.
5,Great Movie! Not my favorite but it was fun to watch!,"The action in this movie was pretty good. If I had to rank the fast and furious series, since I own them all, I would have to rank it the following from best to worse. Fast Five, The fast and the furious, 2 fast 2 furious, Fast and Furious, and then tokyo drift. The cars were really cool in this movie and the story was pretty good. Would recommend to any fast and furious fan."
5,Fast & Furious Reunion,"This one was much better than the previous sequels. A must if your a F&F fan and/or a Vin Diesel fan. If this is now the standard, I'm looking forward to another."
5,Thank you,I love this movie so much. My fiance got me hooked on them and when he moved he couldn't find his copy so we've been going from Toyko Drift to Fast Five over and over again.
1,Seriously?,That's the best effort they could make?The only good thing about this movie is Jordana Brewster and that's all I'll say about that.That GPS thing was hilarious too.
4,Fun Movie!,"This movie brings back Vin Diesel, so it is much better than the second and third installments that didn't have him. Very cool movie. Very fast-paced. The opening scene is very exciting. If you liked the first movie in the series, you'll be sure to like this one too."
5,Fantastic movie!!!!!!!!!,I thought this was a great movie!! I liked this one better than the previous 3. Highly recommend this to watch. Paul Walker and Vin Diesel are great together. Lots of action and drama A++++++
3,"Good characters, lines, haphazardly executed/thought out story","I love Gambit and Wolverine the characters, even if not perfectly done in this comic. I especially like few of the quotes in this comic tho the story is lacking:Wolverine: ""Might've thought to bring a bigger car--""Gambit: ""Dunno, I find it kinda cozy.""Wolverine: ""One problem solved.""Gambit: ""Which is?""Wolverine: ""You won't be needin' mouth ta mouth. . .""This is fun especially to a gay x-men fan like myself, tho unfortunately the first may get spoilt in comic by a woman being in car too. Relatively good art, tho the rendering of Gambit is too gaunt.The major failing of this comic tho is the illogical storyline, Gambit has a mental barrier and couldn't be manipulated so fully by a ""novice"" telepath. Also, tho some nice eyecandy, the plot is anti-climatic in the extreme."
3,Souls At Zero - 'A Taste For The Preverse' (Energy),"Armed with their new drummer (for this CD anyway) Jamie Miller, Souls At Zero have returned with this here second effort to bash your senses silly. From the opener ""Undecided"", the heavy duty ""Taken Apart"", ""Thrown Down"", ""Human Distortion"" and ""Needles"", this ensemble provides living proof they mean business. Not all metalheads will even like this CD, but if you're open to experiencing lesser known artists like these guys and willing to take a chance, you might actually get something out of this disc."
2,Not what I thought,"On the website this watch looked much better. Now that I got it I am kind of disappointed. It doesn't look like the price I paid for it. The stainless steel band looks horrible. I thought it had a clasp, but it's an expandable slide on. When i read the website I think I mistook expandable for adjustable. It's really not cute."
3,Well represented,"Another in the seemingly endless parade of teen pop queens, Mitchell fails to do anything here that sets her apart from any other pop princess on display these days. Her singing is very credible, and a few of the tracks are pretty good, especially the title track and 'Broken Promises', and the other uptempo tracks follow in that same vein. The ballads are what you would expect on this type of album, typical and ordinary but all in all inoffensive to the ears. If she can put together some stronger material, she may have a future. Otherwise, she's going to get lost in the shuffle and, ultimately, the cut-out bins."
2,Great for those in physics,"This is a problem solver book with few diagrams and a lot of newspaper-type pages. The text is blochy heavy seriffed and is difficult to read. I have opened it once, maybe twice. Like your typical problem solvers, you can now find a lot of solutions (even to your specific problem) on the web...for free. There are a lot of equations and theories, but not enough useful stuff for applying these equations to conditions in the real world. The equations are not numbered well and it is impossilbe to tell between interemediate derivations and the final useful equations. Unless your deep into this stuff, it is not for the typical engineer."
1,No Sound,"When I received this item several weeks ago it worked fine. Since then the sound quit working and you can't record. I called the company and after dealing with a less than friendly service rep, he finally gave me an RA (return authorization) number so that I would have the priviledge of mailing the unit back (at my expense) for a replacementClassco Classco Caller ID Announce"
4,Great Low Vision Solution,"I am legally blind and this device has really helped me. I like that I can record my own voice on it to say the names. It has been very easy for me to use it even without being able to see. The only problem I have is that sometimes my phone gets an echo for a few seconds, but the people on the other end can't hear it."
1,Short Lived,"Initially I really like the ClassCo caller id box. Having the voice announce the phone number is very convenient. When the phone rings, you don't have to stop whatever you are doing and go to the phone to read a name/number. The voice announce lets you hear who is calling.Unfortunately after just over a month, the caller ID box no longer works. The phone company has been out and determined that the box's wiring is bad and affecting phone service."
1,Beyond Obsession DVD,I never got to watch it since the DVD is deffective. I woulld like a refund of some kind for the money & time I spent on this particular order.
4,"Beyond ""Show Me the Way""","With this CD, Peter Frampton demonstrates that he is more than the few popular songs from the ""Frampton Comes Alive"" album. Fingerprints is a great mixture of many music styles and listening to it is a joy. I first heard some of Fingerprints on the Bob and Tom Morning Show and I was really impressed. The rest of the CD did not dissappoint. My personal favorites are ""Blooze"" and ""Grab a Chicken""!"
3,Peter Frampton is a great guitarist!,This album is completley instrumental. The guitar is out of this world. Peter Frampton is one of the best guitarist I have ever heard. Not all of the songs on this cd are good but alot of them are.
2,Not what I expected,"This CD was a disappointment. It simply does not feel like a Frampton album. This in all probability is because of the many other collaborators on the album. Maybe it's just me, but I was hoping for a more up and rockin' album from one of the finer guitarists and musicians of my generation. Overall---I expected better."
1,Strange stuff,"Shakspere wrote Shakespeare, Bacon wrote Bacon, King James (""born under Gemini""), inspired their writings. Throw in a 19th century `scientific' spiritualist named Rudolf Steiner, an obscure and possibly mythical person named Christian Rosenkreuz from the 15th century, a large dose of Rosicrucianism and Freemasonry, an extremely nave acceptance of all Stratfordian assumptions, and you have something that defies description, logic,and digestion."
5,Sitar,"the sitar is a great instrument for my 2 year old, he has become a local prodigy and will continue to move forward in life through many hours of improvisational meditation.I am very grateful to be able to watch the young ladies swarm to him play that sitar.. he has become quite the ladies man,... hehehehe"
5,A way to engage people in Bible studies,"This book consists of 60 calligraphic renderings of Bible passages and an very short explanation by Botts as to why he chose to render the passage as he did. This explaination shows how his art engaged him in a reflection on the passage and how his study of the scripture inspired his art. This is much along the lines of Jo Milgrom's Handmade Midrash. For anyone who is themself interested in calligraphy, for those interested in art as prayer, or those interested in using art as a means of encouraging bible study this is an excellent resource."
5,great talent!,"This is a must have book for Christian people. Botts' talent is extraordinary! The perfect ""coffee table"" book!"
4,Great Bird care Book.,"This book was a complete book of care of many species, domestic and some wild. It answered general questions on feeding and care, but I was looking for a book on how to care for orphaned wild birds, which this book did not cover. If I just wanted a general care book, though, it would be wonderful to have."
2,disappointed,"Like other reviews, it doesn't look as pretty as in the picture. The strap looks not so nice and quite short."
3,"Natural, but disappointed","I bought this album because I loved her last album ""Dream comes true"". I thought she is better than Charlotte Church because she used her voice naturally. At least she was not trying to sing Opera songs horribly as Charlotte Church. But surprisly and disappointedly ""shine"" is not the type of ""dream comes true"". Her voice appears to be a mature pop singer. And the tones she sings is different, not as ""musical"" as she was. Maybe it is because her voice change. I don't know, but i'd feel pity for losing a musical singer to listen to."
4,best taste of the celsius drinks,"This cola tastes just like regular soda. It's the least chemical tasting of the Celsius drinks. The next best one is the ginger ale. These drinks pack quite a caffeine punch, and my coffee ""cup"" is a 6 cup model I fill with Starbucks dark roasts. My caffeine tolerance is high, and these drinks still make my heart race a bit, and sometimes make me a bit breathless. I would not drink one after around 3:00. Still, when I have one before exercising, the difference is clear. Riding my bike is much more productive if I have one of these 20 mins beforehand. This is a great energy drink, if you're ok with a serious caffeine buzz (without the sick stomach feeling from too much coffee). I would skip the other flavors and stick with cola and ginger ale. I thought the berry one was gross and the green tea one was only tolerable."
4,Beware this is not hc but will most likely enjoy it,This is strictly Dub work and is a very laid back piece that is listenable almost anywhere at anytime check it out homes.
4,"Terrific camcorder and easy to use, even at a spa","My second Sony camcorder is even better than the first, and is light enough to take along on frequent travel trips, including spas in the US and Canada. I am going to Quebec City and will certainly be able to compactly pack, use and edit anything I take with the Sony camcorder.My one complaint is that the strop gets in the way when I place the camcorder on its shoe."
2,Not worth the extra money...,"Well I just got this model to test. I am returning it tomorrow as i find it no different than my refurbed discontinued HC20 I got for ultra cheap at the Sony Outlet. Picture quality in my opinion is exactly the same. Handling is the same with the HC42 having more options. So what about the 12x optical - its only 2x more than the HC20. Everything about this camcorder reeked overpriced.I admit I bought this one mainly for the Analog to Digital passthru but after thinking it over it is not worth the extra cost at all. Half the options (still pic, memory stick, etc...) are things I will not use.I honestly feel that this is an overpriced camcorder. I tested a Panasonic and it was cheaper and well if you need all these options it was a better buy to get a Panasonic GS35 (30x optical!)As for the analog to digital passthru - i am going to stick with my old Sony D8 cam for that work. This is just not worth it. I'd look into the HC21/32 if you really want a Sony."
5,"Sony is the best, again","After much searching for the perfectly priced, and well performing mini DV camcorder, I came back to Sony's HC42 model. I've owned a LOT of sony products over the year, and have yet to be disappointed. This is a solid camera, packing a touch screen, an upgraded lens, 12x optical zoom, and a docking station which connects your camera to the computer (via a firewire cord that YOU MUST PURCHASE separetly, it only comes with a USB cable for tranferring pictures) and is also a charging stand. It comes with some video editing software, but I would suggest Pinnacle 9 Plus, or a 3rd party if you are really into video editing. The picture quality is awesome, ease of use is great (it even has an 'EASY' mode, where high tech options disappear from the screen!). You cant go wrong at this price point. I wouldnt go for lower models, and the higher runs over 1000 bucks..this is the sweet spot. Enjoy"
1,Camera has defect,"I have enjoyed this camera for about two years. It is small, light, takes good video and is what I need from a video camera. However, this model and many other Sony models have a CCD Defect that causes the camera to record nothing but sound and a black screen. Unfortunately, Sony does not acknowledge this as a defect, even with the number of people that apparently have this problem. The repair cost for this is more than $200 from Sony, so I will be looking at other brands to replace this."
3,Easy to use but.....,"I love this camera based on its ease of use, and the super picture. I hook it up to the tv and it fantastic. I have read the accompanying booklet however, cover to cover (the english part) and still cannot figure out how to convert the tapes to dvds or playable cd's. I have a camcorder with larger tapes and purchased this so I could end the drawers and boxes full of tapes. Now I still have all those tapes, they are just smaller."
4,Its alright.,Was sent one with a messed up trigger spring but seller was cool to send me another one.Overall Gun fires strong and has a nice weight to it.Also the description says its full and semi automatic.. Mine is only semi.
5,Philosophical Tennis Game,"&#65279;A quick look easily could fool a dilettante because of the quaint characters concerned about conveying their views connected with issues of origins. After a brief Introduction on competing ideas, the illustrated adventure leads to the meeting of Professor Teller and Professor Questor, two biologists who challenge each other's views regarding origins questions. From page to page the banter flies rapidly like a tennis ball going back and forth, thus forcing the observer-readers of the book to see both sides.Both players score philosophical points, but creationist Questor tends to have the final ""word"". What's the outcome? In this game the reader of the book wins because he/she (whether evolutionist or creationist) will be challenged to reconsider the strengths and weaknesses of the performance of players on both sides."
2,dont waste your money,"sound its ok , but the volume coming in is way too low , i hate it... i would not recomend this headphones ."
5,SRV's life laid bare,"When Stevie died in 1990 the world lost a rare talent. This book details the many difficulties he encountered and the extraordinary way his determination and music won through. Some of it is very painful, but his triumphs over substance abuse and difficult bookings is inspirational. What a shame the man died at only 36.A very good book about a great man."
5,Enjoyable Read,"I liked this book very much. I think it told SRV's story very well. I can't imagine what the 2 volume book out on him has in it, this was plenty I think. It was very interesting to read about Stevie's love of guitar from early age and how things progressed and ending in his untimely death. What a great loss. Thank heavens for recordings. He lives forever in this manner. I am glad he was able to live the latter years of his life clean and sober. I'm sure it helped him a lot to find peace within. The life of a star can be so frazzling and hectic and so out in the public I do imagine. He probably wouldn't have traded his wild years for anything, but on the other hand was glad to find a world out there that wasn't all sex and drugs AND rock n' roll. Just sex and rock n' roll I suppose. Anyway--rest in eternal splendor Stevie....we DO love you!! What a guitarist!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,"Disappointing - all pictures, no ""guide"", VERY HEAVY","My fiance and I just went to London and Paris for 10 days and bought the Eyewitness Guides for both. After the first day we didn't bother carrying either one. First and foremost, these are HEAVY - beware, it was a major reason we stopped carrying them. But our biggest gripe was that they simply didn't have that much information. Heaven forbid you want to find a restaurant or a bar near where you are. Good luck with that. And the neighborhood maps covered a tiny area of the actual neighborhoods. The books are wonderfully illustrated and do have really interesting information on the sites they do cover, but it's really limited to the major stuff. These books would serve better as a primer to read before going than something to actually carry around. I will say the pull-out map was useful, particularly the pull-out part."
2,Definitely not what I was expecting,"Basically, if you're the kind of person who likes a lot of covers, and pretty short songs, this set is definitely meant for you. I was really excited for a lot of the music because I saw some good names on the back. When I listened though, I felt kind of ripped off because so many songs were just cheesy covers, and I just couldn't see why the originals couldn't be put on the CD instead. To top it off, many of the tracks were extremely short. I don't know if it's just because I'm used to listening to tracks that are 5+ minutes, but I still think a lot of the tracks should have been at least 3 minutes long. Personally, I would say that my favorite CD out of the set was the Havana Nights one. The songs are pretty good, but like I mentioned before, pretty short too. If you're looking for something that will expose you to more Latin rhythms, I don't really recommend this compilation."
3,"Petrarch, moi?","Oh, a sonnet sequence - that quintessentially Victorian enterprise and these days, with the revival of form, no longer so surprising. These fly but rarely soar. He rhymes azaleas and ideas, Sonora and Gomorrah, and I love him for that, but I'm not getting the wow factor; Marilyn Hacker churns 'em out, John Gallas starts Star City with a hundred and Stan Smith put his entire family history into the dazzling Family Fortunes - but hey, it's all good"
4,a voice of an angel...,"if you've never heard mina, you (of course) won't know what you're missing. many of the songs are in italian, but don't let that dissuade you. this, as many of her albums, are just as entertaining to those of us who are italian impaired. her smooth voice wraps arounds words and puts out a sound that is enchanting and entrancing.a particular standout on this album is lontanissimo. better known as ""somewhere"" to us west side story fans. a fantastic track that you'll find yourself playing over and over."
3,Great size - Average image,"There is no doubt that the size of this monster is impressive, at 61"". For being a rear-projection unit, it is not too thick, definitely thinner than the slim version (this is the ultra-slim). The image is far from a plasma, though. Before this I had a 50"" Zenith Plasma, where the image was much more nitid. I knew that with a rear-projection the image would lose, but I thought that the bells and whistles of the DLP and the 1080p would make up for it. They do not. Yet, a size like this in plasma would be about 2.5 times more expensive, so..."
1,Ultra Slim has design flaws.,"If you are only concerned about the top 80% of the TV it looks good...even great but when the ESPN banner comes across the bottom it looks as if the stats are on a roller coaster. Samsung rep came out and said it was in spec??? Amazon is returning w/o cost....read other comments on eagle delivery there right on. Note: I own a 50"" SAMSUNG DLP for 2 1/2 years and it is great....someone just dropped the ball on this model."
4,Not what I expected,I am very pleased with my TV. However the shipping that was guaranteed was incredibly slow with not very much good customer service. I do like the television after spending some time to work with it.
3,"Good, but not Satisfying","I've been hearing ""Dashboard Confessional""'s name echoing since this summer when I first heard about it. I finally got the CD. It's good, but not GREAT. Full of emotion, but there is a definate lack in the variation of melodies in Chris' songs. They all sound VERY similar, same pitch of the voice, same key.Let me tell you, I am in LOVE with all of the lyrics. They're phenomenal. Especially ""This Ruined Puzzle""...look up the lyrics, it's worth it.As for buying the CD, listen to the song clips first. Then decide. Personally I'm not much of an emo person. However I appreciate immensely the acoustics of the albumn.The last track is very...emotional. Near the end it actually sounds like the singing turns to desperation and near tears. Surprising, in my oppinion. So listen for yourself. The guy's a great poet."
3,i like dashboard,"give chris carrabbacredit for making the acoustic guitar a beautiful wonderful sounding thing. upon first listening to it, i was vaguely reminded of nick drake. the low rating is for the ""woeful me"" almost cheesy lyrics. however if ur ever in a bad mood because of romance troubles or lack thereof, this is easily a 5 star album."
1,Oh please...don't make me laugh,"I cannot believe so many downtrodden emo kids are raving about this peice of wasted plastic. I'll grant you this, it IS emotional, very emotional. But it sounds more like an annoying one-man soap opera. It sounds more like he's just whining....Well! no wonder so many teenagers like this! Wait, get that thumb out of your mouth, I'M a teenager too, and I generally LIKE emotonal music! Hey never said I liked ""emo""...but what the hell IS emo, it seems to change with whatever style of music a bunch of crying losers with slicked back jissom-gelled ski-slopes who can't get laid are trying to pull off unsuccessfully. Unfortunatly, I thought I got a free frisbee out of it, but I did find that this album is GREAT for jerking off while crying in the rain...just awesome."
1,this guy still doesn't know how to write a melody,"The acousti-fying of ""emo"" is an idea that was lucky to work once. Unfortunately for Dashboard Confessional, the New Amsterdams barely beat them to it. Listening to this is like listening to the New Amsterdams, albeit not anywhere near as good. I guess it shouldn't be a surprise, though, since the Get Up Kids are so superior to Further Seems Forever. Anyway, the new New Amsterdams CD is nowhere near as good as Never You Mind. This entire idea is unusually boring. About this CD, there is nothing to it. There are no melodies. To be nice, it is .... At least loud ""emo"" is sometimes interesting (although Further Seems Forever is completely useless). Anyway, if you want to obsess with this guy Chris, go for Further Seems Forever, but a better idea is just to forget about him."
3,Not my usual kind of music,"When you read the lyrics in the booklet, it reads more like poetry rather than song lyrics. Which is almost what this CD is: poetry sung over guitars and drums. Which definetely is not a bad thing. These days, as the quality of music and lyrics continue to go down the drain, this is one of the smartest written CDs released in quite a while.The problem, however, is that quite a few songs sound the same, mainly the ones that just have an accoustic guitar. The best song is ""Screaming Infidelities."" It not only has a great title, but also amazing lyrics and music. ""The Brilliant Dance,"" ""This Ruined Puzzle,"" ""Again I Go Unnoticed,"" and ""This Bitter Pill"" are also standout tracks.I'd love to give it more than just an average rating for such fantastic lyrics, but the music (or lack thereof) needs work."
4,impressive,"I was very impressed with the amount of raw emotion that comes out in these songs. I'm not used to hearing that captured on an album, its something you usually only hear at live shows.'Saint and Sailor' rocks, you gotta love it!"
2,"Well, the first one is fine...","alright, i know this album is barely 30 minutes long, but i can't listen to the whole thing all the way through. can't you crybaby emo imbiciles hear that every song is EXACTLY THE SAME? goodness. either way, i don't like this album for that reason. the first song is bearable. the rest is whining. all of it is whining. i know that that is what emo kids want, but i dislike it. it's time to start listening to another band after the first 3 minutes. i made the mistake of seeing this band when i went to see the anniversary. the anniversary rocked hard, but all the crap dashboard fans just stood there so they could cry about how crappy their lives are. waa waa waa, hold me! i hate that. go somewhere else and give a band like the anniversary, which is actually good, some credit. and stop crying. bastards."
5,This Album Surprised Me,"I'm a girl that tries very hard to stay away from anything played on MTV.. basically anything too mainstream. I guess you could call Dashboard Confessional my guilty pleasure. I carried this CD with me for two straight weeks. Every song means something important, and the acoustic guitar is amazing. The content of this CD lets me get around the fact that Chris Carabba sold out one too many times. Buy it, you will love it."
2,NEEEDS SOme Work,"Its evolution,baby. Dash Bored Confessional went from SUPER rock funk to Sellout coporated fatcat loving hippy dippys. I think the low point of their career was the demonstartion against Eminem at the MTV Video Music Awards. Also, the new tatoos were stupid."
1,WASTE OF MONEY,"Terrible software. My printer will not print my projects from Zoom though it prints all other software just fine. You can't save your projects to jpg or other similar formats...only to a Zoom format-which means you can't send your creations to anyone or anywhere!I needed this software to create ebay auction ads. Well, I can create the ad (with limited features and limited creativity) but I can't sent the files to ebay or anywhere else.What good is software that I can't print from or send???You can't use shading in this version. You can't use freehand cropping (only can crop with a square box shape).And the clip art/click art isn't very good either.Just a waste of my money...a total waste."
2,Truckstop Quality,"Okay I bought it because it was cheap and i was hoping it might be a reissue of the vinyl record of the same name. If I recall it has several songs from that album: The Race is On, Honky Tonk Downstairs, Almost Persuaded and the title track. 18 songs total sound quality is as good as vinyl. The one drawback is I really don't want to hear George Jones sing Okie from Muskogee, Fightin Side of Me or Hello Darlin. Truckstop Quality is to say if you were on a cross country roadtrip withdrawling from caffeine, CD's in the car on their second time round this would be a great pickup for the price when you stopped for coffee."
3,Deeper than most of his poetry...,"A good book, a good example of his first work. I found it a bit too deep for my taste and not consistent with what he wrote later in his life which is less deep."
3,If Only I Could Have Forseen This Book's Enjoyment Level,"Another in the line of mysteries featuring Warner's claivoyant sleuth Mrs. Charles, The Tarot Murders is an easy to read, but not outstanding book.The tarot deck features in the plot (the murderer sends a card to his victim, then leaves another card on the body), and helps Mrs. Charles figure out who is behind the crimes. But I found that aspect all too confusing and pointless. I did like the heroine, but her ability to see beyond the normal senses plays no part in the tale -- it's mostly her intuitiveness that helps her uncover the murderer."
3,FOUL!,"I absolutely adore the character of Mrs. Charles, but the solution to this mystery comes from out of left field, with no real build up or groundwork. I don't mind being fooled by a mystery, but I should be able to look back and see the information I missed. When it's not there, I have to cry foul. Consider the stars solely for the wonderful Mrs. Charles."
4,depression starts here,"This sounds like the more desolate moments on the third Big Star album, which is a beautiful thing. Imagine Mr. Chilton sitting at the piano at 2 a.m., half-stoned or whatever, unaware that the tape is rolling. He plays a few tunes, many of them just song fragments, but he plays 'em straight from the heart. If that sounds good to you, then you need this CD. The only thing keeping me from giving it 5 stars is the price, which is a bit high for a 28 minute recording."
1,"""The One: The Last Word in Superheroics"" is the last in everything","I was severely disappointed with this book. Veitch was a pioneer for utilizing fear and the supernatural to deliver unprecendented work of series like ""Swamp-Thing"". ""The One: The Last Word in Superheroics"" fails to deliver fear or the supernatural, the themes we've come to expect from series by Veitch. The plot was tired. Whereas ""Swamp-Thing"" was innovative ""The One..."" falls flat without a sense of purpose or direction."
2,Glorified technical listing,"This is the only publication from this author that has ever disappointed me. I have a number of his others and they are stellar.It contains a lot of descriptions of rasgueados, but that's really it. The advice (practice slowly and use a metronome) was pretty thin.What disappointed me most is that there was no attempt made to delve into the ART of the technique. Such as when or how to use different rasgueados to achieve different affects, how to transition between them, etc.If all you want is a list of some of the infinite number of patterns, maybe this is for you. If you want something more you won't find it here."
3,"Great stories, but a bit dated","This book is at its best when focusing on the less recent past in it's stories of Benny Binion, Howard Hughes, Jay Sarno, Sam Boyd and the like ... which are all excellent. I found the Kirk Kerkorian and Steve Winn ones a bit lacking, mostly because their stories aren't really over yet.The last two chapters, not bios, but concept pieces , ""How Popular Literature Has Treated Las Vegas"" and ""The Adult Playground Becomes a Heaven for Families"" .. are pretty much a waste since Vegas has now focusing on going back to its ""Adult"" roots ..and the read no longer makes sense.However, it you want to get some great and entertaining stories of the ""good old days"" .. and even a little before the ""good old days"", the first two-thirds of this book is certainly worth the asking price."
2,only for insomnia patients,"This book gives an overview (upto the date of it's writting in the mid 1980's) of the historiography on the decline and fall of the Roman empire. It strives for completeness and is 600+ pages. But because of that and of it's academic German language, is quite unreadable. Minor authors are mentioned in 10 lines. In that short space only the 3 major claims of their book can be repeated, but the consistency of their arguments is lost. Having read 7 of these minor authors, the reader will be lost in details too.No real effect to synthesis or analysis is made.The book can be used as a whoiswho in ""decline history"" and as an encyclopedia.Don't expect it to be a good read. It's very putdownable."
1,"cheesy, cruddy, cr@p","I bought these because a friend of mine bought a pair of Logitec or Creative noise canceling headphones that were awesome. These are not awesome. The materials are cheap. The earphone portions are uncomfortable, and apparently they are made for a child's head because my small to average sized head is still uncomfortably squished. The best (read: worse) part is that they don't work. They don't cancel anything. I've tried a couple of other brands so I do know what to expect.In the case of these, I expected a lot more."
1,One star is too much,"I was expecting some insight into unique forms of poetry. Wrong! Random thoughts with very little depth of understanding. Self published, and self critiqued, by an author that suffers from inflated self esteem. Not worth the dime or the time."
3,Big Rig Comic Tales,"I enjoyed it and look forward to the second one. It is mostly from some time ago and much of the content tells of a time gone by. All industries change, but it is valuable to see it from another drivers perspective and from another country. Cheers Rod."
1,Not a very good camcorder,This camera is not very good - poor video resolution after recording it on a memory card. The software is horrible and Sony tech support just plain lousy.
3,Cannot connect to Mac 2012,I have recorded more than 1000 movies on my videocamera but I cannot connect to my Mac. The camera is very good though.
1,Problems with all Sony MiniDV cameras,I bought one of the Sony miniDV cams and it lasted less than a year with minimal use. A google search will show you how many others have had this problem. Sony wants more than the price of the camera to even look at it. Do your homework before you buy one of these lemons.
1,not for me,I tried to watch this movie but there was too much male nudity in it. As a 100% HETERO MAN I could not stomach it. If I wanted to look at a guy's ... crack for 2 hours I would have hired a plumber. George Clooney could have a good career shooting ... porn.
2,Confessions of a Dangerous Mind,"A project that had been through many incarnations before George got involved and attempted the seemingly impossible...should have remained on the shelf. Now I know why investors had previously walked away from this project...too much hype, too little film."
4,Great Trailer,"I must say that the movie disappointed me a little bit. Sure, it has great performances (esp. Sam Rockwell in the lead), and great writing and directing. But the trailer misled me, and I was expecting a movie that had more sizzle (a la. Ocean's Eleven) than this film. This is NOT to say that the movie isn't really good ... it's just that the trailer misled me.Overall the film gets 4 out of 5 stars!"
3,One Of The Better Books,"I did like this book. Yes, there is some motivational gibberish involved, but it didn't annoy me. Instead, it struck me as friendly and chatty.But. This book just does not hold a candle to Dan Poynter's ""Writing Nonfiction: Turning Thoughts Into Books."" Yes, it's about writing nonfiction, and yes, it can be used to quickly organize any writing project. I've been teaching screen and play writing for thirty years, and Poynter's book helped me tighten my own teaching and writing.Again, Bollow's book is great. I own both mentioned above, and simply prefer Poynter's."
4,Work well,"Very good product, somewhat easy to install.Supplied 3m tape works well, but invest in some silicone for sealing the mounts."
5,Golden Boys,"Wonderful character movie, full of amusing interaction. Featuring three seasoned actors. Retired sailors living together which is a hoot in of itself. When they decide to bring a woman into their lives it just gets more interesting. Watched it twice already, great discovery. Arrived in fine condition & quickly."
2,High school level acting but simple story was funny,"I can only say that the acting was not very good. The accents for the area were really amateurish as was the ""old seadog"" language. But it was entertaining but not a classic. Pop some popcorn and sit down and watch this with the wife and kids and have a good light hearted evening."
2,I Can't Say Boring but Close,2 1/2 stars??...This book was the worst of the three. I think it could have been so much more. The characters should have been developed into something really great but they weren't. I am glad I read all of them but I was disappointed in all three. Not a whole lot of depth. I thought the first one started off really good but each book got a little more boring for me. I am not a real fan of the way this writer writes. I feel like I need to go back and read a really good book after reading these three.
5,Quick Review,"It is excellent. It is in Spanish. It is a direct translation of ""The 21st Century Children's Bible"" published in 1999 by AD Publishing Services."
4,Little Giant,I've had this camcorder for a week now and I think it works great .. except for the touch screen feature. That takes a little getting used to .. especially when accessing the special features (such as fader effects) while filming.The digital still quality is poor when recording directly to the memory stick .. but the same images taken as a still from prerecorded tape is much clearer.All in all it is a good product .. just takes some getting used to.
3,Ancient Egyptians,"I am very disappointed with this DVD. The first half of disc one the entire""The Battle of Middigo"" is defective. The picture freezes, then many colored squares fill the screen and then half of one scene and half of another, accompanied by a grinding noise. The rest of the disc and the second one are fine. I would not purchase from this vendor again. In my experience if one DVD is defective all in that batch are the same."
3,Cindy is getting dumb..her character is being ruined,"WHAT??????? Cindy goes from one horse to the next, all the new ones are her favorite! What about Glory?!? First it was Glory,then Storm,then Champion. Cindy needs to get a grip! She is starting to be a snob! Oh and what ABOUT ALL THE OLD CHARACTERS like Tor, Mandy, Pride, the Townsends, Glory, Princess, Shining..ect.... WHAT HAPPENED! THOROUGHBRED IS FALLING APART!"
2,Regular,"Tuve este camara por año y medio, la usa bastante. Cualquier dia simplemente dejo de funcionar. Se daño el bus de datos que esta al lado del carro del cassete. Se daño simplemente por ""mucho uso"" o mas bien falta de calidad. Además la camara tiene problemas cuando enfoca fotografias. Es muy linda pero muy, muy delicada. No volvere a comprar filmadoras Sony me pase a Canon, que son menos lindas pero mas fuertes."
3,I didn't really care for this product. It ...,"I didn't really care for this product. It did help a little with bad breath, but I didn't like the way it left my tongue feeling: it made it a little sore."
3,Nice Design,"Fast Shipping, nice design. Materials used are not the best, if the base had been made of ceramic or glass I think the price could be justified."
1,Very Cheaply made,hands were loose when clock arrived. I sent it back. I looked so pretty in the picture but its very thin wood. Not happy with it at all
2,Not The Greatest Movie Out There.......,"Overall I was not impressed at all with this film. Ambushed, had a christian base, but some foolish little puppets added to it that does not leave much for older children and adults. In Search Of Dudley Dumpling, was pretty bad. The acting was hideous(in both movies), and the script was poorly written. In the show, there is a little puppet boy named Dudley, who gets saved and tells everybody about Jesus. That part was christian-like, but the other characters, I just can't leave out. They act foolish and giddy, driving around in a car and hitting eachother with bags. Kids 3-5 maybe could get a little enjoyment out of this film, but my two little brothers, 5 and 7 sometimes cry when I turn this movie on. I do not recommend."
5,Great wedding or shower gift!,"I was given a wedding anniversay memory book on my 1st anniversary. I LOVE IT!! The art is fantastic with beautiful colors and the calligraphy is so elegant. I love the concept of the book. Every year as I sit down to prepare the entry for another year, I think back over all the wonderful moments I have shared with my husband. I also think about our life together and how our relationship is evolving. I wonder what we'll look like and what we'll be doing when we've been married 30, 40 or 50 years.I purchased the wedding anniversary memory book as a shower gift for someone who is getting married in October. I think it is a great shower gift or wedding gift. I hope the new bride will enjoy her memory book as much as I do mine."
4,Very nice wedding gift,"I purchased this book for a family member who is getting married, and I think it will make a wonderful wedding gift. The book is very well made, and the graphics are beautiful also. I gave it only 4 stars, as like some other reviewers, I too, feel that it would be nice to add some extra space to add more photo's and extra space for writing memories. This is truly something, that you wouldn't purchase for yourself, but you would be happy to receive it as a gift."
5,Great Wedding Gift idea,This book has been a wonderful wedding gift! So many of the reciepients haven't seen or know about this and it is a special gift that they can use every year. Lots of compliments! (I even bought one for ourselves and we sit down and look through it on our anniversary each year!)
5,Fabulous Shower Gift!!!!!,The wedding anniversary book is such a fantastic shower or engagement gift! Every bride-to-be just loves it and raves about it in years to come!!!
5,One of the best Trance CDs out right now.,"This is a progressive mix, and from start to finish you can let it play, which is rare. I actually play this CD more that Creamfields and State of Trance. There is alot of music that I've never heard before, but I plan on looking into DJ Misjah Helsloot more, and following him. I'm really impressed, even more so that Water Music put this out. The comment above mine should help out more, but I don't really write long comments. I really plan on looking into the DJs that the comment above mine mentions though."
2,Pretty Basic,"The tracks on this CD were pretty basic and not original. As with a lot of rappers, Cassidy is an ego maniac and much of the content on the CD is about how great he is. He states that he the best rapper alive since Biggie died. What about DMX, NAS, Snoop Dog, Ice Cube, etc. Any of the aforementioned have more style, substance and creativity. I bought this CD after hearing ""I'm a Hustla"" on the radio. I'm sure Cassidy will just be a flash in the pan."
1,CAUTION - This CD may open computer to viruses.,"This CD contains MediaMax DRM copy protection which exposes all PCs to viruses. This CD installs software to a user's PC EVEN if the user answers ""No"" to the End User License.Stay away from all Sony CDs with MediaMax software - otherwise you risk corruption of your computer. Hopefully, Sony will do the right thing and recall these 6 Million+ CDs before they do any more harm. (Sony already recalled the other 4 Million CDs that contained XCP spyware.)"
4,This is a user-friendly cookbook.,"I bought this book after attending a tofu workshop that Julian taught. She uses soybeans in her daily diet and is so sold on the health benefits that she even grows her own. I like the fact that this recipe book lists the health benefits that are derived from cooking with soybeans. It also tells you step by step how to prepare soybeans for cooking. That's a big help to me. There are some very good recipes. My favorite is the Squash Casserole. This dish has so many good ingredients, including the soybeans. I'm slowly learning to incorporate these wonder beans in my daily diet."
1,Switch Didn't Work,"I tried two of these thinking the first was defective, but was unable to switch between PCs with the replacement also. If I booted only one PC it worked, if I booted both, only the PC that booted first worked regardless of which side of the switch it was connected to. I was very disappointed."
1,Cheaply made product,"This particular product is a piece of junk. I bought it after using the previous version where you plug in the cables into the switch box seperately. I am still using the older version at work for the past 2 years. I ordered this for my home use, thinking this is a more compact, better and newer product. 2 months after I started to use it, mouse and keyboard cables stopped working. I would have view on the screen, and I wouldn't be able to do anything from the keyboard or the mouse, on one of the PCs only. It would work for the other PC. And since cables are built in, I could not replace the cables, either. I ended up throwing away $35. It's cheaply made, very low quality product."
3,Slightly Blurry Video,"I have pretty sensitive eyes and there is pretty noticeable distortion on the video. I'm attached to 2 laptops and an 18"" Dell LCD at 1280x1024 resolution. The blurring is manifested as a slight shadow to the right of the ""true"" image. For example, there is a slight shadow cast to the right of black text on a white background. Strangely, this blurring is worse on my connection to an IBM T23 laptop. The blurring is slightly less noticeable when connected to the docking station that my Dell Inspiron is attached to.Another caveat to note is that as my IBM laptop doesn't have a keyboard connector on it, I can only drive the monitor through this KVM switch. For some reason, the mouse doesn't seem to work if the keyboard split is not connected to the target machine. This may just be this machine so I'm not sure."
2,Wasn't what I expected,"Bought this to be able to switch between my computer and my Xbox 360 using one monitor, but the problem is there is no manual switch and the 360 does not have a keyboard so therefore we can not switch between the two. Right now trying to find a work around."
2,Aggravating,"I bought this dictionary for the express purpose of helping me (before I gain proficiency in German) read philosophical discourses which make use of untranslated words in German (these are very common). Sadly, this dictionary seems to have none of the words that I've needed. Even the simplest of expressions, like the Erlebnis, are wholly absent from this dictionary (as far as I can tell... unless this dictionary has a ""secret compartment"" where all its more useful words are waiting, somewhere beyond the ken of those of us trapped in a merely phenomenological existence...)Perhaps it's useful for people who want quick reference while travelling through Germany... however I have doubts even about this as (in the English section) I couldn't even find words that I KNOW exist, like the equivalent of ""good bye""...In sort- it's frustrating. But maybe there are SOME that could make use of it, and so (since I'm a charitable sort) I'll give it 2 stars instead of 1..."
3,Ok book,"Ok book, sometimes I wonder if these are written by humans or robots...but so be it. If you want something worthwhile it's not too bad."
2,New Age versus Christian,"This CD is not for the Christian. It is definitely New Age, mentioning chakras, energy and auras. These are not Biblical references and can lead to wrong thinking, in my opinion. This CD does not glorify Jesus Christ, our Lord."
4,Great product,"This is a really silky lotion- my infant son had a rash- that the pediatricians couldn't figure out, one said eczema and another said seborrhea derm. Whatever it turned out to be- after using mustela milky bath and the lotion- it was gone! The lotion is great for infant massage because of it's silky texture. Just watch- a little bit goes a long way! I used what I thought I would need for his legs, and I ended up with enough to do his whole body"
3,dentak pik and mirror,the initial order I received was poor. I informed the company of my complaints and they promptly shipped a replacement which was much better.
4,Interesting suppositions,"I found this book and its various essays to be very interesting and insightful into future possibilities. Physical book quality is normal. The topics covered are diverse, from cosmology and astronomy to the various mathematical branches. The credentials of the essay authors lends much to the weight of the predictions, with some material over the head of the average lay-person. Discussions of finite mathematics and picoseconds of astronomical time get out into the 'fringe' science area, but are brought back to normal people's reality in discussing the implications of these researches. A most stimulating read and highly recommended for scientifically minded citizens."
1,Not Authoritative,"This should be refered to as a ""modernist"" view of the Church. It's imprimatur has been removed and rightly so. Read the Catechism of the Catholic Church if you want to know what we really believe."
2,"Great soundtrack, poor storyline","I guess I'm oldfashioned, but I didn't find this at all humorous. It was more tragic. I loved the music though..."
1,Misleading Reviews,"WARNING: Amazon's DVD reviews include ALL reviews and not exclusively reviews for the DVD selected. This resulted in my being misled, ordering the wrong DVD, having to return the DVD, and order the DVD applicable to the motivating review. Respond only to reviews related to the DVD you are considering. One star rating is for Amazon continuing to include all reviews, in spite of multiple customer complaints and requests to include only reviews for the DVD selected."
3,Cinematography and One-Liners Overshadow the Actual Story,"I saw this movie for the first time a week ago. With all its critical aclaim and praise, I was a bit disappointed in the actual plot and story. The quick love story between Elaine and Benjamin just didn't seem believable or perhaps the chemistry between the actors were less believable than Mrs. Robinson and Benjamin's affair. The best things about this film were the quirkly one-liners of Dustin Hoffman and the camera angles and cinematography of the director, which during this time period had to be ""ground-breaking"" or ""matrix-like"". It is worth seeing one time but not a movie I could repeatedly watch."
2,What?,"What is with the hype for this movie? It was just not good to me. I know most who didn't like the movie, liked the music, but in my opinion that was distracting too. Way too much of it. It was almost like watching a music video with a weak story about a stalking psycopath thrown in between songs."
1,Buyer Beware,"On the heels of WB's giving the finger to fans of Cabaret a few years ago (the newly released DVD claimed it was anamorphic and wasn't), we get this pointless MGM re-release on DVD of The Graduate which is not anamorphic, nor enhanced in any other special way. So why re-release it?MGM -- it's no wonder you've collapsed. Nuts to you."
4,DVD-Audio - But in Stereo ONLY,"This is a really great album by Neil Young but this DVD-Audio Edition is STEREO only! DVD-Audio allows for multiple versions of the same disc, usually a Surround Mix and a Stereo Mix - but this ONLY has a stereo one.Also, the quality isn't that much of an improvement over the CD (having listened to it too) probably because it was remastered at the same time.And just beware, unlike SACDs you can't play these in regular CD players. You can in a DVD player to get a CD quality recording."
4,toaster,"Satisfied after buying many toasters through the years, it does seem to toast lower corner much darker than the rest."
2,Just not very good,"This book is mostly void of intellectual prowess although it is quite effective and leveling mostly empty, fiery claims against liberal America. The book makes sweeping generalizations, lifts things out of there proper contexts and uses really hostile language to critique the ""other side"" which is basically everyone who is not a right-wing religious zealot either Jewish or Christian. ALthough it is not a poorly written book, and occasionally makes a decent point, it is nothing earth-shattering and there are definately better books about the ills of America, reading this whole thing is wasting time."
2,Well written deceit,"One would think that the extreme right wingers would eventually start boring themselves with this trite nonsense. But the flood continues, although I found this book better than some. For one thing, the writing does not even try to conceal the authors desire to silence those who differ with him. That is refreshing honesty, for usually this type of book claims compassion in Christianity, while this book takes no prisoners. If you do not march the tune, you are not allowed to sing. Fortunately, this is America, and we shall sing all we like, and express our opinions freely...."
5,Great fun!,"My 2 1/2 year old daughter loves this. It has the original style paper dolls that I grew up with, but also has a ton of stickers . . dresses, shoes, jewelry, all the accessories. It has been hours of fun!"
1,Horrible,"This album is so bad, it wasn't released; it escaped. Lawrence Gowan is no replacement for Dennis DeYoung. Styx is gone. It so sad to see these musicians ruining the Styx name. Empty dreams and Bingo halls are where these guys are headed. Wait a minute, maybe these guys will release another live CD or better yet another compilation CD. I can see it now........ Styx-Live at Wal-Mart(An evening of Rocking and Shopping). Give me a break. Avoid this [###] at all costs!"
3,"Some standout tracks, some ... Overall ""okay""","This new album by Styx I wouldnt necessarilly give five stars but I can't give 0 either.Why not 0 stars? Well there are several great standout tracks, such as tracks 2 and 3.Why not 5 stars? Listening to ""Kiss Your Ass Goodbye"" was just beyond stupid. Had I not known this was Styx I would have propagted it coming from teeny-bopper groups like Blink 182. Totally stupid song, period. Obviously not what STYX is capable of."
3,Change of musicians.,Gave this three (3) stars because I do like STYX. This album has maybe 1 or 2 songs on it that are worth the purchase and that is all. I do miss the wonderous voice of Dennis DeYoung with this band.
1,Product has known issues,"Card never worked right. Has ""black screen"" issues that are all over 3dLabs Forum. Did everything tech support suggested and nothing helped. Returned card for an nVidia based card."
1,NOT WHAT I EXPECTED,"I BOUGHT THIS ALBUM BECAUSE I LOVED THE SONGS, BUT IF YOU ENJOY MUSIC BY THE ORIGINAL ARTISTS, THIS CD IS NOT FOR YOU. I WAS PRETTY DISAPOINTED BY THE FACT THAT THE SONGS WERE REMADE."
1,LIKED IT AT FIRST AND THEN---NO!,I regret having written a rave review for this item a while back. Compared to the Gold Touch this is a real piece of junk. Flimsy and poorly made. After a few months the space keys and the shift keys all started to rebel (even though the keyboard was kept clean and dust-free) and I have a light touch. Trying to press the failing shift keys damaged my pinky fingers until I could no longer type on it at all. I would stay away from this model. It's cheap for a reason.
2,Same Thing Over and Over,"I heard a Russ Conway arrangement on our cable music channel and really liked it, but was disappointed when I got this CD. The CD had only two or three tunes that were comparable to the one I had heard on cable. The style on most of the tunes was so repetitious and predictable. Buying this was a mistake."
5,on of the best spiritual books I've read,I have read this book about five times. I absolutly loved it. I wanted to buy it in audio but saw it was abridged.
5,The Rulership Book,"This book is indispensible in astrology work. I will never be a professional but the woman who taught me always had this book with her. She said you dont need to remember everything, you just need to know where to look for the info. This was one of her prized reference books"
2,Very Poor Sound,"If you're lookng for an inexpensive HDTV, stay away from this one. Spend the extra money and get a good TV.The sound on this is horrendous. I have a 10 year old CRT television with much better sound than this. Don't even bother with the stereo sound because it drowns out all the voices in movies."
1,Display Crapped Out,"The LCD display failed (dimed to the point of being useless) after 6 months actual use. And I was chagrined to learn the thing has only a 90 day exchange-type warranty (consumer pays to ship defective unit) -- that's it! Customer Service would offer no accommodation of any type -- so, I'm the stuckee. For $300 or so, I didn't have high expectations, but this product came in lower than low on reliability, warranty and customer service. I'd advise steering clear of all Phillips Magnavox stuff. They demonstrated to me that, even at a good price, they are a firm that delivers much less than what you pay for."
1,Not sized correctly,"I have purchased this item before from Beals through Amazon.com and was very happy with the product. This time, I bought two colors of the same item and they were not sized correctly as they did not fit like my other pairs that I have ordered within the past 6 months. I was very disapointed. They were made in a different country than what I had originally purchased, so maybe they were cut differently and not to the correct size."
2,Good for beginners I guess.,"I bought this product awhile ago thinking it would be pretty cool. Maybe I'm just used to using Pinnacle Studio 9, but I didn't really like this one.The video controls were just not usable. From trimming and cutting to adding effects and trying to complete a menu for a dvd, it just didn't perform well.I can't say too much more on it since I gave it away to a friend of mine. He doesn't even use it now. He uses the moviemaker that came with Windows XP because even that program is better than this product.If you are looking for something decent to buy, get Studio 9. It's easier to use and has better tutorials."
5,What A Wonderful Gift to Receive - True Love,"""A Christmas Wish"" is a great book! I enjoyed it. Young Kimberly Franklin was a determined female and set out on getting the best Christmas present she could think of for her uncle, Pierce. That gift was in the shape and form of Patricia Burke. Although Patricia and Pierce were not on to what Kimberly was conniving, they were mutually attracted to one another. So one young girl's wish turned out to be the best present for everyone."
3,list of films,"Includes: BLIND FIST OF BRUCE, FIST OF FEAR: TOUCH OF DEATH, KUNG FU: THE PUNCH OF DEATH, 36 CRAZY FISTS, LEGEND OF THE EIGHT SAMURAI, THE STREET FIGHTER, BLOODFIGHT, BREATHING FIRE, BLOOD OF THE DRAGON, and SHOGUN'S NINJA.If you don't have these already, this may be worth getting. If you own a few other collections, chances are you already have several of these titles."
1,"Good selection, poor quality","Good selection of tools. Many to choose from. I can always find the right one. However, 2nd day of using, one of my bits broke. I did not apply a lot of torque. It just snapped. Structurally, I'm not that strong of a build myself, so anyone who fancies themselves athletic may need to heed this item.I don't trust this tool set at all. If you want a good selection of tools with the highest quality and build, purchase something better than this, and spend the extra cash. I was going to give this two stars, but now I'll give it one."
5,"Good Service, excellent product",I received the card fairly quickly. The price was good and there are no problems with the product.
1,didn't receive,"I didn't receive the smartmedia card because of an error on the sellers part. I haveused smartmediacardsbefore for my older fuji camera. The intended purchase waqsof the same brand and size, so I will say that it is a great card, but very fragile. Bend it once and you won't use it again"
1,This card has NEVER WORKED.,"I purchased this card for my keyboard, with hopes that it will work like the one I currently have ---for a back up. It doesnt work. Never has, and it seems it never will. I tried to contact the seller and they were no where to be found. The product they gave me was a 'dud' and now they cannot be reached. NEVER BUY anything from this seller, unless you want silence for a response."
5,Good product!,"Just recently got the chance to use the card, and it performed flawlessly. Got the best deal through Amazon. Hard to find, otherwise."
5,Adding memory to dated Olympus d-380 camera,"After wasting time and gas trying to locate a replacement SmartMedia Memory Card at a few local camera and big box stores, I decided to head for Amazon. Based on past experience with other purchases, this should have been my first move. Within a click or two, Shoptronics was online with exactly what I needed and the capacity I was looking for. I had pretty much given up hope this product was still available. It fits perfectly in card bay...and now I'm good to go for another plesurable vacation. Price was great and delivery in 4-5 days."
5,KJ McGee Review of Smart Media - 128M for My Olympus Camera,"The (2) SM cards (128 MB each), shipped and were recieved on time as promised. These SM cards worked as well as the original SM cards that came with the Olympus camera (Camedia 2002 model). These SM cards are not used in any recent cameras or other devices so I was happy to find some at a reasonable price. Completely Satisfied and will purchase from [...] again. They also came with a plastic snap case for each card which is a good thing to have to protect them since I carry the extra cards in my camera case.KJ McGee"
4,"Great product, worked well as mu old ones",I have a Olympus Model C3020 zoom that I've taken all over the world with me. My last Smart Media card had just about been worn out due to taking so may pictures. I went on line and found the site where I could buy a 128M disc and the rest is history. I took 54 pictures recently in Minneapolis Mn when my Daughter and her family moved there without any problem.
2,partly good,"i really like the look of the toaster, and it does a nice job; on one side. the toasting elements on one side in each slot do not fully heat up so it toasts one side more than the other - will be trying to get it repaired, or likely, will have to get a new one."
1,The Worst Toaster in the History of Bread,This a great looking toaster. Kudos to the designer. The engineer who designed the inside should be shot. The thermostat is set so high that at the lowest setting it almost burns a Pop Tart. Any setting above three and a half burns bread. The bagel setting doesn't work well because the outside heating element is always more powerful than the inside element. Hence bagels take forever (It turns off the outside element). Bread/waffles burn on one side and aren't crisp on the other. I look forward to posting pictures after using this toaster as target practice.One positive...the slots are a great size.
2,Falls short on what it could have been.,"I had high hopes for this book. I do believe in primal leadership, that there is a real, biological basis to what does and doesn't work in leadership. Basically leadership is going from an art to a science, and it's this biologically based approach which will get us there.The problem with this book is that it's needlessly fluffy. There are lots of ""case studies"" with quite frankly poor science in them. I got discouraged to see the text stay so high level, and make grand statements without backing them up.What I was left with was a number of ""you should do this"" statements, but without enough specifics on why or how to be useful. It's too bad because the concept of primal leadership is great. For some reason Goleman didn't deliver.Where to go? Maybe check out ""Working with Emotional Intelligence"" by Goleman, which is pretty good."
3,Fairly nice work,"The concept of emotional intelligence is a fascinating one, and this work delves into the ins and outs fairly nicely"
5,Excellent Summary of Important Thinking,"In many ways this audio CD is better than the book it is based on. Goleman's writing style can be stodgy, but his audio presentation is very good and it is great to hear the author emphasising the lessons that he thinks are important. Buy this if you use EI in business."
5,Excelente !!! Very Insightful and Practical.,"It is direct book, straight to the point. It has much less neurocinetic theory and much more day-to-day concepts. Even if you haven't finished Daniel Goleman privious books, try this one !!!"
1,Biggest Rip Off EVER,"This was the ONLY thing my daughter wanted for Christmas. We made her wait until Christmas to get it and she was soooo excited. AND THEN, IT DOES NOT WORK! I found out after searching the web and spending HOURS trying to fix this that it is not even compatible with Vista. We have 3 computers that do not run VISTA and it will not work on ANY of them. This is the biggest waste of money I have ever seen! I still don't know how to explain this to my heartbroken daughter. Shame on you greedy manufacturer to disappoint SO MANY KIDS ON CHRISTMAS and not offer any solutions! After watching my daughter cry for so long (she is mentally retarded and just does not understand) I will NEVER purchase any BRATZ products for any of my kids again!!!"
2,Misleading title,"The title of this book is misleading. I expected that this book would discuss career opportunities for technical people in various industries like biotech, the film industry, etc. It does not. This book is more of a guide of how to get a job in technology, how to negotiate, etc. than anything else."
2,Just OK!,I too was disapointed by this book! It just keeps going round in circles! I never felt that bad for the main character although I should. The writer just does not bring that out in me. I'm almost done with it and I still don't really care for any of the characters.
2,Her dilemma -- who cares?,"Unlike ""Animal Husbandry"" and ""Dating Big Bird,"" Laura Zigman's previous novels, ""Her"" is a waste of precious wood pulp. With a main character, Elise, who isn't fleshed-out or sympathetic, and a story -- she obsessively spies on her fiancé, Donald, and his ex-fianceé, Adrienne -- that is one-dimensional, not to mention awkwardly constructed, the novel belly flops. Other than a detailed list of streets in northwest Washington, D.C. and occasional forays into the coffee shop of Politics and Prose, there is nothing to recommend this novel. Laura Zigman should atone for the trees that died to print this atrocious tale."
4,"Good Lord, I've been there...","If you've ever been a jealous, self-involved trainwreck at any point in your romantic career, you'll totally identify with the heroine of ""Her."" Not satisfied to ever leave well enough alone, she picks away at her own happiness by becoming consumed with ""the other woman"" who, let's face it, we've all compared ourselves to at least once.I am not sure why this book has gotten such poor reviews. I loved it...read it in one sitting. Maybe some people here just don't want to admit that they, too, have been there, doing the drive bys...waiting in the bushes...lol"
3,Tolstoy's Short Fiction,"Book is in great condition. There was a problem in shipping but when something's coming from the UK to the US, I should have expected it. Can't wait to start reading the book for class!"
3,Wrong colors on the website,"The helmet is great and thanks to GIRO. The colors on the advertisement on the website are wrong, I got the Pink/Silver helmet following the colors as indicated on the picture on the website, I thought it would have details in Pink/silver and most of it would be black as on the picture, but it is completely different, is all silver/White/Rose (not pink). Is a shame to have mistakes like these nowadays where you can find cameras avery cellphone.....and I pay for the mistake!!!"
3,Not as comfortable as I wanted,I replaced my crash damaged Giro Prolite with the Atmos and was not pleased with the overall fit and comfort. It felt clunky if that makes sense. I decided to try the KASK Mojito and like it for my head shape long and narrow. The KASK is also extremely adjustable.
3,This has been a good phone,"I have had this phone for about a year now. I almost always recieve good reception thorough this phone. I just recently changed the cover because the phone comes with two, which is a nice feature.My only complaints are that there is no regular phone ring tone. They are all songs or the T-moblile ringtone. The other thing is that the select button is kind of odd and can be difficult to use by just pushing down on it. Sometimes it goes right to the camera or other features and not the menu.This phone has held up pretty good for me. I am not too hard on it though."
5,MP3 Clock Radio,really happy with it. i needed one with a remote so i can rock my baby to sleep and be able to change a song or lower the volume.
1,This product is garbage,"I have owned this clock for about 4 months, and the first 3 were just fine. After that, it stopped working properly with my ipod. Nothing I did fixed the fact that I could no longer wake to my ipod. To add to that, its buttons have recently changed operation (eg. the ""set alarm"" button now changes the display's brightness, the snooze button does not function). I would highly suggest purchasing a different product if you plan on using your ipod in this clock with frequency."
3,Good radio clock for iPod,"Before I bought this radio clock for my wife as a gift, I did some research and found this is the only one fit for her needs. The radio is small and can be put on our small night stand. She can hook her iPod to it and control with the remote. Sound quality is good.I just want to several things that needs to be improved to make this product a perfect one:a. The AM radio signal reception is not good even with attached antenna. We live in a high-rise concrete building and signal level is fairly low, but still I feel like the radio reception should be better. No problem with FM.b. Every time you connect your iPod to the radio, you need to take off the iPod skin. It would be nice ff the design could leave space for the skin.Other than those two, my wife likes the radio very much. She doesn't have the problem some reviews mentioned: alarm volume control when the alarm starts with iPod; clock display too bright at night.All in all, it's a very good product and I recommend it."
1,Don't buy this phone cord!!,"This cord is very cheaply made -- don't buy it. The modular connections are so flimsy that they don't make a proper connection. As a result, when I was using my phone the other person's voice faded in and out. Very frustrating and a waste of money. I had to replace the cord (with a Belkin)."
1,Nothing good about these...,"I really don't like these. They feel very, very bulky. Someone else mentioned that they are one size too small, but I think mine actually feel bigger than what they should be. Also, I bought it somewhere else and it said that these are good shower sandals. Not at all - it takes them more than a day to dry up even in winter when it is very dry in my home..."
5,Solid Slides,When I first put them on I was disappointed. They where tight andthey hurt my feet. I was going to send them back. After a fewdays they have broken in and they are great. Very solid andcomfortable. Glad I gave them a chance.
4,Adidas Slides,I got these ones for my husband and he isn't quite as fond of them as I am of mine. They just are not up to his his standards of a sandal. They are kind of heavy and no give. He wears them out to the deck and around the house.
5,Excellent,"Arrived pretty fast, which I greatly appreciated. Condition great. Will use this seller again."
4,Fantastic Indy Film,"If you enjoy the raw sometimes random noir of Indy films, then plop down your milk money for Ligeia. Lawler takes from Edgar Allen Poe and presents it in a warped yet focused way. Where Lawler's budget lacked his choice of Actors easily makes up for it.As stated above where all Indy fall short is the budget, yet Lawler gets his priorities straight with smart camera shots, and exceptional sound recording.Buy Ligeia, you'll thank me a couple years from now, because Lawler and his crew are going to go big."
5,Greate Camera,"Got this camera on time and work's greate. I purchase this camera for my niece Birth day, and she love it. rechargeable batterys is a must."
4,Notes on Trail Tales,"I was looking for the book,""Trail Tales"", for a friend of mine who once had an original copy. She was pleased with this reproduction, but missed the pictures that were in the original. However, I was able to get the pictures and a copy of the book through Gutenberg Project. I would still like to get an original copy of the book (in book form) for her if one can be found for a reasonable price. Thank you Amazon for your help in my search."
5,Killer Amp,"Wow, this thing is sweet! It can pretty much reproduce any sound you like cleanly into seven speaker and a sub. Sounds amazing with audio and video. It has been a struggle to not turn it up too loud. I have had issues with not getting enough power to the rear speakers in the past and this thing is just the opposite. I have to turn them down so that they don't overshadow the fronts. I will admit that they are closer to the seating position but wow. Finally I'm getting the power that I expect and more. This thing does what its supposed to do. Turn it down low and all the speakers still have vibrancy and clean clear discrete separation. Turn it up loud and it demands your attention and respect. I cant say enough about it. You will be impressed! Buy it fast while they last!"
3,Really needs an editor,"Harold Coyle delivers his customary slam-bam military action thriller, but the experience is marred by the obvious lack of any sort of proof-reading (is that a lost art by now?) with many jarring typos that interrupt the pleasure of reading. Coyle makes several mistakes himself - the most obvious howler is his use, twice, of the word ""marionette"" when he reallywanted ""martinet."" That one's hard to forgive. Also, way too much of his dialogue consists of speeches and harangues that no normal person would ever actually deliver in conversation."
2,"Not the 10,000","I'm 10 pages shy of finnishing this novel and it's been a struggle. I wanted to like this book as I have read all of the Scott Dixon novels right up to The Ten Thousand (haven't read Code of Honour and not sure if I will bother). The book started out great but went downhill fast. Aside from the thin plot and over abundance of underdeveloped characters the book is rife with editing errors. I'm not sure if the errors are due to the publisher or the author, regardless of fault they detract from the novel in a most annoying manner and destroy any flow to the novel. I really enjoyed Mr. Coyle's previous novels, both the Scott Dixon ones and his civil war series and I can't believe he could pen such a poor sequel in light of his previous great works. I feel cheated and wish I'd spent my christmas gift card on a different book. I will be very reluctant to pick up another novel in this series."
2,This book is borderline ok,"I just finished this book and I was glad I was finished. The editing was lacking as well as the plot. The author failed to develop the story fully, didn't provide sufficient background information, and used military terms specific to the Army he didn't define. The action parts were also limited."
5,happy consumer,got what i exactly wanted. i loved the tv series . the game is just like it. I hated i waited this long to play this game.
5,LOVE it!,"I opened an art gallery this summer and wanted to produce my own prints on an Epson Stylus R1800. My goodness! I was amazed at the results! Truly, I would have never guessed the difference could be so great. I thought my work was printing nicely before, but I've read a lot of folks just raving about this Fine Art paper and wanted to try it. It is pricey, but well worth every penny. The reds in my pomegranate paintings have never been so brilliant. I enthusiastically endorse this product! Well done, Epson!"
1,Don't buy this paper!,"It is rare that I write a review. I do read and appreciate other reviews though. That is why I felt it is important to leave one about this paper.In terms of quality - it does do nice print outs. In terms of printing with it - it is a nightmare!I am using an Epson R1900. It is almost impossible to feed this paper in the manual paper feeder in a way, that is accepted by the printer. I would say at least 9 out of 10 times, does this paper not feed into the paper feeder correctly. Anybody who has to work efficiently and whose time is valuable cannot afford to buy an expensive paper and then spend hours trying to get a few prints done.I would never, ever buy this paper again. I am really angry to have spend my money on an epson paper to use with my epson printer and then not be able to easily print.If you own an R1900 do not buy this paper!"
2,Don't waste your time,"I bought this book on sale and thought it would be a good reference - looking at how large it is. However, I have not been able to get a single answer to any of my questions.The text goes into no in-depth explanations and it literally has copied the Books On-Line documentation that comes with SQL Server! I don't know how they got by with this as I compared it almost word-for-word in many, many places.I say it's a waste of time because you might as well use SQL's own doc because there's no extra cost and you can search for your topics. Then spend the money to get another reference that goes into more detail and covers what-if scenarios."
1,Do not buy this book/waste your money!,"This is one case where Microsoft's book is much better than the other books on the topic. Buy the MS Administrator's Guide unless you are certain you are an advanced user/administrator/programmer, but no matter what, don't buy this book."
1,sucks,"lasted for 2 days. I dont recommend it to any body, it is the worst deal ever. plz guys dont buy it."
3,Interesting novel,"This is the first Amy Tan novel that I have read. I've seen the Joy Luck Club and loved it. So I thought I'd give one of her books a whirl. Unfortunately it took me over a month to read it. Although I enjoyed it when I read it and finally finished it today, it was not one of those can't-put-down novels. The writing was witty at some places and insightful about the mother-daughter relationship. I learned something about the complexity of the Chinese language and also a bit about China's history. But the tale never managed to grip me and keep me holding my breath till the end. I will, however, look for other novels by Ms Tan."
5,Good read!,"I selected this book based on a recommendation from a friend, and chose it as this month's choice for my local Book Club. I am hooked! You will enjoy the writer's prose and the way events are told through the different character's perspectives."
3,The Bonesetter's Daughter,"I have recently read Amy Tan's The Opposite of Fate and thought that it was fascinating. She indicates that many of her books were inspired by herown life and family stories. That is evident in The Bonesetter's Daughter but this particular ""novel,"" although fascinating and mystical is also dark anddepressing. I generally expect a final result of feeling that I have reaped knowledge and insight into another culture but I am not feeling that uplifting resultfrom The Bonesetter's Daughter."
3,Let Down,"I was completely thrilled when I heard that Amy Tan was releasing a new novel. In fact I was in the store the day it came out and was shocked to discover none were set out.Amy Tan's novels remind me of John Irving. Two amazing story tellers that keep you engrossed and yet each story is the same. And worse for Ms. Tan, the locations & characterizations don't even change.The only difference here is the set up. Rather than toggling between past and present, the first half of the book is set in modern day S.F. The second half in China.For a newcomer to Amy Tan, you will love this book. For her fans that have been anxiously awaiting something new, you will not find it here."
5,A Wondrous Book,"Amy Tan is an exceptional writer and more importantly an exceptional storyteller. This book is so wonderful and so moving that I finished it in one day. Soul, heart, and magic are what make up this novel. You feel every moment of this story. Our schools should make this required reading...for the history, the racism, the love and reapect for our elders. A wondrous book."
4,wonderful book!,"I really enjoyed this novel. It was one that was hard for me to put down. I have never read The Joy Luck Club, but if it is anything like The Bonesetter's Daughter, then it is something I need to read. Amy Tan's style is unique and her story touching."
3,Not as good as I expected,"I'm a huge fan of Amy Tan's, but this book let me down. Don't get me wrong -- it's a GOOD book. But I expect GREAT books from her. Her previous books (especially Joy Luck Club and Kitchen God's Wife) held my interest so much more. I felt that the characters in The Bonesetter's Daughter weren't as believable or likable. I agree with the other reviewer who wrote that Amy Tan should try writing a book completely about the old days in China, and leave the modern Chinese-American descendants out of it. Now THAT would be interesting."
5,I loved The Bonesetter's daughter,This is a wonderful new book by Amy Tan. I was intrigued just by the title. The bonesetter is a doctor who creates powders and potions using dragon bones to heal ailments. I love reading about Chinese women too. This is the reason I bought this book. Luling is a strong woman who raises her daughter Ruth by herself after outliving 2 husbands. Luling is the daughter of a mute nursemaid whose identity is unknown to Luling until after her death. I loved reading about how Luling grew up in an orphange. She finds love and a vocation in the orphange. This is probably the most touching part of the book. Ruth Young is a ghostwriter who takes on the responsibility for her mother's care after she develops Alzheimers disease while juggling her career and other demands. This is a very enjoyable book.
1,Here we go again,"It seems that when Amy Tan wants to write a book, she pulls out her previous manuscript and then just changes the names of the characters. I really like her writing and it's really a shame that she just can't get past her own life, or whose ever life she keeps repeating over and over again. There's lots of fresh ideas and material out there, but Tan just keeps plugging away at her old and really tiresome formula. This is the last Tan book I will read, unless she truly comes up with something new. Otherwise, why waste time and money rereading something you've already read--what is it, three times over now? I think she's written three other books besides this one, but it gets confusing because they're all nearly identical."
2,So Disappointed,"I am a fan of Amy's Tan's, but this book was a big disappointment. As other reviewers have said, it's just a rehash of the same old materials. And she doesn't write well in the third person. Her first person writing can be in a simple style, because it lends itself to the diary feeling of her books. But in third person, it lacks substance. I was curious as to the dedication at the beginning of the book. In it, she states that she gives credit to her grandmother and mother for anything good, but she will try harder next time. I wondered if she herself doubted the quality of this book. The middle (the mother's voice) is by far the best part--the ending is of a ""slap you over the head with what you should have learned"" variety, and the relationship between Ruth and Art just plain isn't interesting. I wonder if Tan has run out of things to say. Perhaps this will be her last book?"
2,I've had better......,"Definitely not one of Tan's best novel. I was expecting Joy Luck Club, but got a Danielle Steel instead. Many aspects were amazing, mind you, but it had a trashy undertone."
4,Sweet...,"I never actualy purchased this toy as of yet. However, if I had, I imagine it would be flippin' sweet! Awesome! What the heck would you think with an action figure like that!!!"
1,t,This did not work and I spent 1-2 hrs trying to fix. it is true You get what you pay for ..this was cheAP.. BUT I THOUGHT IT MIGHT DO THE JOB
3,Works As Designed,I actually purchased several of these because I occasionally need an adaptable power supply.The units appeared a little rough with excess plastic cutoffs and a little corrosion on some of the metal surfaces. I expected this as the vendor adequately descibed these issues.I have used them each and they have functioned well.For the price I am happy with this purchase.
5,Just what we needed,"This product was just what we needed, arrived in the right amount of time, and is still working great. I recommend it."
3,adaptor size,"wrong size adaptor connection to fit a miniture video camera 7.25 volts, Can you help me with sizeing for this unit that wasdisplayed on the supliers add, but no referance to the transformer to go with it."
3,It's just ok,"I've tried a few different creams now. This one is just ok. Not fantastic. It is kind of thin and a little runny compared to the other's I've tried. It did clear up my son's rash, but I like buttpaste better and am currently using Weleda Baby Calendula Diaper Care Cream, which I love."
5,Guide to technique adjustment,"Morrison's CLASSICAL ACTING is perhaps the only available acting text which clearly delineates the adjustment in acting technique necessary to fulfill the demands of heightened classical text. The chapter entitled ""Words, Words, Words"" is especially valuable in explaining the socio-political background of classical acting; in addition, it clarifies the verbal agility and listening skills required for this work.It also explains the value of RHETORICAL ARGUMENT and ORATORY as methods of ""convincing"" in Shakespeare--and notes with sadness our modernist tendency to replace skilled oral argument with attitude.An extremely valuable book for actors interested in creating vivid, full-blooded, passionate acting in classical texts."
4,Better look closer,I love this paper but just feel they should let you know it's 20 sheets and not 50. I usually order it by the roll and should have looked closer. The great deal wasn't as sweet.
4,Scarlet pimpernel,"Good older movie. I was expecting some sword fighting and action, but there isn't any. The acting is good and Merle Oberon is looking HOT!"
5,The Scarlet Pimpernil,"I have seen this movie several times and really enjoyed it. I was purchasing the video for my personal collection. It never came, the post office stated it was delivered, but I never received it."
4,"They seek him here,they seek him there.Is he in heaven or is he in hell?","I love some of these old classics,and this is no exception.Its a great adventure around the time of the French revolution.Sir percy stops executions,and gets involved in helping people get out of France."
5,The Scarlet Pimpernel,This is one of my favorite movies and have seen it many times. I just wanted to have my own copy of it.
3,Very poor quality DVD,"The Scarlet Pimpernel is one of my all-time favorite movies, 5 stars, worth watching just to hear Leslie Howard quote from Richard II, and there is much more to like. But the quality of this DVD is dreadful, 1 star. There is considerable background noise. Faces go white. The quality is such that it appears the DVD was made from a TV broadcast of the movie. It is advertised as digitally remastered, and that does not seem possible.The DVD is made in Taiwan. The description on the DVD case identifies the Scarlet Pimpernel as ""Hero to the Oppressed People of the French Revolution."" Not exactly :-). I will not purchase another DVD made by the company that made this DVD, Digiview Productions.As Percy Blakeney says, ""There is nothing that is quite so bad . . ."""
1,Avoid the Madacy,"The 1-star rating is for the Madacy print - the movie rates 4 stars. As a general rule avoid anything by Madacy, they market some of the worst prints imaginable of movies in the public domain. This one is no different. It is dull, dirty and virtually unwatchable. If you want to see the Scarlet Pimpernal then wait for the TCM movie channel to broadcast their beautiful print from time-to-time."
5,Leslie Howard made this movie the classic that it is.,"The part of Sir Percy was perfect for Leslie Howard; no one could have played it better. His characterization of the dual personalities was wonderful to watch, and his use of voice inflection and body language to portray the incredible wit of his character would have made even Oscar Wilde himself recognize and applaud true talent when he saw it. I have been disappointed time and again in my efforts to purchase this movie; apparently, copies of it are no longer made. If anyone knows of a legitimate place where I can purchase it, please e-mail me at MistressE1@aol.com and let me know!"
4,Visit the castles without leaving home,"DVD only shows current footage of the castles, no re-enactments, no historical pictures nor paintings. It lacks some narrative background and historical notes.The kind of DVD sold as touristic memento at the castle gift-shop. Not of bad quality, though - the images are very clear and well shot."
1,"Snooze worthy ""romantica....""","if you are easily titillated, then you'll probably enjoy this anthology. I guess I'm just jaded-I'd like some semblance of a storyline with my erotica-and it's just not here folks. The three stories bedroom scenes also fall heavily onto submission and domination-also not my personal cup o' tea.I find the best thing to share about this anthology really is the book is exactly what the title suggests-strangers who have just met and go at it-but of course they fall in love after the grunting subsides-Geesh!Take my advice-skip this and go straight for the pay per viewNo stars."
3,Last scenes of Last Dance worth the watch,"Like many I'm a fan of Patrick Swazye and saddend by his passing. I bought this DVD because I thought it would be a nice keepsake seeing him dance with his wife, Lisa Niemi. It is that - a keepsake. Patrick Swayze was not a great actor, but he was so passionate with his characters that they were believeable. The story is a bit hard to follow and there is lots and lots of dance rehearsals which can get boring, but finally when he and his wife do their whole dance together it was beautiful. It brought tears to my eyes."
3,Loved seeing Patrick and Lisa together,"Good premise, I can appreciate the work it takes to be a dancer. Some of the acting was a little over dramatic and choppy scenes. But I enjoyed watching Patrick and Lisa dance."
4,"""If You Love Dance...""","If you love dance (balletic, rather than ballroom), you'll surely enjoy this offering starring husband and wife team Patrick Swayze and Lisa Nieme. Directed, as well, by the latter, the film also stars dancer/actor George Dr La Pena. Assisting the stars are young dancers of breathtaking ability. The entire company deserves high marks! The slight story of former lovers (Swayze and Nieme) brought back together for ""one last dance"" is merely a device to allow the cast to show their balletic ability. The most haunting image of the film is provided by the shots of a solo Swayze dancing in a darkened studio amid wnd-tossed gauzy curtains. The Swayzes had tried for years to interest Hollywood studios in the film, finally producing and releasing it on their own. An insightful audio ""making of"" track provides interesting details. I recommend this film for its fine dance work, in spite of its slight story line."
3,A master class for those who want to film dance,"Very few people know how to photograph dance on film. Ms. Niemi & her cinematographer do.There are cuts and closeups which take advantage of film's immediacy and flexibility, but often the dances are shot wide, the dancers shown from head to toe, and we get to experience all they express. The overhead shots, in particular, are gorgeous, give a unique sense of the flow of the dances, and are used with intelligent restraint.I can't argue with many of the criticisms other reviewers have mentioned, but I wish the photographers of movies like ""Step-Up"" had the courage and trust to follow this film's example."
1,Disappointment,"I have always enjoyed Patrick in all of his other movies. And I have always wanted to see Patrick and Lisa dance together. How could this movie be bad? Oh it was. The story left a lot to be desired, the acting by the two main characters was so stilted (yes I understand it was meant to be - but no hidden passion even came across), even the dancing between the two - there was no feeling there until the end and even then it was as tho they didn't like each other much. So I guess if the was the intention - it did come across. However all the other dancers were wonderful to watch! That part I loved. I was fasinated with how ill Patrick looks. Raspy voice, gaunt. And what's with the cover picture? Never once did I see her in that outfit!I think the best part of the of the movie was Patrick's song in the credits. I do happen to really like his singing voice."
4,A decent buy.,"if you love the games than the buy is totally fine, but the box set has a small ""xl"" shirt with the HL2 Logo in white and its quite small. other than this fact the single dvd containing HL2 and HL2: Deathmatch, HL:CS:S on one single dvd is very great instead of the bulky 4 cd's from the standard edition. I bought Hl2 SE myself and only bought HL2 CE due to the sale that went on a few weeks ago."
5,"Don't review til you've seen it, baby... and I have.","I have the beta copy of this game. It is more fun to play the incomplete beta than it was to play Doom 3. The Half-life 2 beta I have is over a year old, yet its graphics are on par with Doom 3. I can also run it on my Radeon 9000 Pro with high settings... Doom 3 needed low settings and 640x480x16 (I play my beta at 1024x768x32) to run playably.This game is Half-life 2, the sequel to what is referred to by the general PC gaming community as the Best Game of All Time. It will own, if for nothing but the unprecedented graphics that I have seen it render on my own machine. I know it will own, however, because of the depth of plot that is already hinted at in the beta, as well as the massive open-endedness of the original.I'm saving up for the full Gold edition now."
4,This book was a very good mystery,Mama traps a Killer is about a mother and daughter team that took it apon themself to solve a murder mystery of a local boy and a out of town girl. As the case goes along they suspect it is one of there flesh and blood what they discover is alot different.
3,nice pan,I have other Chen pans and like them very much.The only downside to this pan was it was delivered with a loose handle.I will try to tighten rivets myself instead of returning.
5,Makes Me Want To Cry..,"I just watched this movie today.. it was my first time watching it. I clearly remember those events on September 11th, 2001'. I was still in High School and the teacher came in and turned on the television and all of us students were watching.. that was how the whole school day was watching the television and seeing what was happening. This movie just makes me want to cry especially the parts where the passsangers were calling there family to say Goodbye and that they love them.. it's really moving.. and reminds me of how grateful we are to be alive and that we should never forget how fortunate we really are. Also all the actors in the film I didn't know any of them.. so it really did make the movie that much more realistic it was like I was actually watching what was happening like it was the actual event. This is a really moving movie and I would encourage you to go and see it when you can.Justin"
1,Silent home movies with Indian music in background,40 minutes of poorly shot home movies. There was some attempt to make it commercial by fancy editing (which failed miserably) and the application of Indian music and chanting. Don't waste your money. END
4,Pretty Good,"I get the sense that Drummers tend not to be very good teachers on camera. Blackwell seems to be distracted, constantly searching for words. However, you do get some pretty cool tricks from the video like the one-handed roll and some stick tricks. Have fun with it."
2,Too much playing and not enough showing,Why is it that literally every drum DVD spends so much time showing the drummer jamming with their bands? Do they have no material to teach? Do they not have teaching skills? When I buy instructional DVD's I want lessons not performances. Don't waste your money on this one unless you are buying it to listen to him showing off.
3,upper nuts were incompatible,"The three upper strut tower nuts did not fit my vehicle. I had to reuse the original nuts. To do a complete rebuild on a Japanese-made 1995 Toyota Corolla, you are additionally going to be needing the replacement dust seal (available only at dealership, Toyota part 90303-22049), the boot kit (Monroe 63620), the upper (Monroe 905947) and lower (Monroe 905960) insulators, and the upper mount (Monroe 905912)."
1,Don't waste your time,"The instructor is really spastic, and the camera focuses on her upper body so much that you can't hardly tell what she's doing that you can follow along."
4,very practical advice,I just finished reading this book and it is full of practical advice most I agree with. Like this book says it is all about confidence and liking who you are and making the best of yourself. I plan on reading it again
1,Sleeping while driving,"I do not like this recording. I'm wondering if I can return it. For the most part I like it but he has you visualize cutting you finger. What was he thinking. It's like some guy in the mail room wrote it. I can't believe he created such and unconscious visualization. Do not buy this product unless your willing to move around this section. I'm very uncomfortable with the creation in my visualization of cutting my self and to recreate cutting my self over and over??? not me. His point about the body's capacity to heal is valuable but I'm not going to go there by starting with the picture and creation of cutting my self. poorly created, unconcious"
4,Glad to have this one again,"Back then, a lot of us were left scratching our heads over the oddly Reaganite-sounding title track on this one. (Not that I object to Reaganites; what was odd was to hear Neil sounding like one.) But I'm glad to have the album on CD; it's far from Neil's strongest, but most of it is good.Like other listeners, I prefer the acoustic ""side"", which includes the last few cuts from _Homegrown_ that hadn't yet been released (that's why the copyright dates are all over the map). ""The Old Homestead"" is marvelously surreal, of course, and it's still one of my favorites from this release. ""Captain Kennedy"" (based on a variant of the same traditional melody Stephen Stills used in ""Know You Got to Run"") is another good 'un.And I still like ""Union Man"". Take _that_, AF of M.It's not my favorite Neil album by a longshot. But it's not just for completists; there's good stuff here."
4,Under-rated release,"I think ""Hawks & Doves"" has been one of Neil's most under-rated releases. He does a lot of great story telling in this bunch of tunes like on Captain Kennedy, The Old Homestead and the funny Lost In Space. It also pays hommage to the hard working American Laborer with Union Man,Comin'apart At Every Nail and Hawks & Doves."
5,two weeks,I work in health care so i wash my hands constantly. I can see the difference in two weeks so breakage.
1,handle broke,"This is a heavy pan. The first time I used it, I was very happy with it. However when I went to wash it, the handle broke when it was half full of soapy water. Am returning it."
5,Geat psychedelic pop,I recently discovered this band and have fell in love with them. Awesome 60's pop psychedelica. If you enjoy good psychedelic flavored pop then you'll love this album.
2,Fruit overpowered by chocolate and sugar,You would barely know there is fruit in these products because the chocolate sweetness is so overpowering. Might as well eat a straight chocolate bar.
4,Great for wedding photo shoot,I bought this to take photos for my wedding. While the wedding is a couple weeks away I'd say that this will do exactly what I need it to. Good deal for me
4,Excellent for the child Star Wars and Transformer Lover!,"I bought this for my 6 year old son, for his 6th birthday. It is a VERY well made toy!! Not like the Transformers - not at all. It's very sturdy and strong. He broke, by accident, several of his Transformer toys (Bumble Bee just being one http://www.amazon.com/Transformers-Movie-Deluxe-Bumblebee-Camaro/dp/B000M69M7E/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&s=toys-and-games&qid=1217903247&sr=1-4 ) - they are just put together very shoddily - not this one though! He wasn't able to transform it over night, but then again, he couldn't do the Transformer ones either. Once he got the transformation of this Starfighter, he's been unstoppable and happy! Plus he loves Star Wars, so it was the perfect gift for a kid who wanted a Transformer, AND loves Star Wars. :) We're happy with it and will buy another for sure!"
2,"Great live playing, not that you'll be able to tell","This is a 2-CD condensation of the 4-CD live retrospective ""10 Anni Live -- 1971-1981"". While the playing is strong, the recording sounds like a mediocre-quality bootleg. Recordings sometimes start or end in mid-song. Instruments (especially Mauro Pagani's violin) get lost in the mix. For some reason, there are 2-1/2 renditions of ""Four Holes in the Ground."" The most interesting material is the earliest (which, oddly, also has the best sonic quality), with covers of King Crimson's ""21st Century Schizoid Man"" and Jethro Tull's ""My God."" Fans of PFM's live improvs will find several long jams here."
1,Just an Index,"I bought this because it said complete in the title. Sure it's complete, a complete index with no title. Hope amazon refunds me my $4.99."
4,Good Buy,I was impressed with the speed w/which i recieved the MP3 PlAYER AND IT'S QUAlity for a small player
2,BEWARE Software is TERRIBLE!!!,"I was so excited to get this, but the software is sloooooooow and buggy. I have never seen a piece of software that is this unstable in a long time. I thought downloading the latest drivers would help, but did not help a bit. Also, why would any company create another MP3, other than Apple, that uses proprietary software and does not treat it as a removable drive or a USB device that you drag and drop to? I like ITUNES, but most proprietary software sucks!! Ahhhhhhhhhh, I am about to pull my hair out!! It goes back tomorrow. I really liked it, but the software is a dud!!"
3,First isn't the best.,"This was the first biography written about Germany's great WWI air ace,Manfred von Richthofen,better known as ""The Red Baron"".This book was originaly written in the 1920's and is rather dated.Several superior bios of Richthofen have been written since Gibbons wrote this one.The books main week point is the authors attempt to portray Richthofen as a cold blooded killer,which subsequent biographies have shown to be totaly false.One of the books strong points is Gibbons' interviews with some of the British flyers who were lucky enough to survive being shot down by Richthofen.Their stories are quite interesting.This book makes an entertaining read,but anyone interested in a more factual account of Richthofen's life should buy one of the more recent biographies."
1,Disappointed,"Have not received it, yet. I was sent the wrong movie which I returned. And, as of this date, I have not received the correct movie."
3,Not as good as I expected,I found that this book had more information from a medical view then from a living day to day view. I also puchased Fibromyalgia for Dummies and found that to be more helpful for people who don't have or need medical background.
1,just for 2 days stuff,I have bought that player from wallgreens. and i could use it 2 days. the 2nd day it has broken. the worst stuff i've ever met!:(
2,Not As Advertised,"Despite the description and reviews, there is no actual book, text, glossary or anything accompanying this audio book on Kindle which pretty much defeats the whole point of it. It might possibly have been good if Amazon/Kindle had got its own act together with audio content."
3,3CMOS is not a bargain for DCR-PC1000,"Iam from Costa Rica, this camera is very expensive I do not recommend you to buy, i t has no night shot or super night shot, the built in Flash has power for close pictures, the picture quality is just aceptable in sun ligth but indoors is very bad, i recommend you to buy the DCR-PC105 or similar from sony, it cost less and is almost the same video quality but this one has more features, the DCR-PC1000 has two modes of picture quality, i do not recommend this device."
5,An excellent work,"Nice album - speaking musically only. But much greater if you understand the language and the culture: this work is an archetype of classical French culture, with tremendous spiritual depth (like Genesis' The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway). The work is so insightful and quintessential that I have often mused that the original Cirque du Soleil concept (a somewhat-psychedelic saltimbanco troupe) could have come from this album."
1,Horrible Camera System and service,"I bought the 2.4Ghz version of this camera which is supposed to be better in transmition at least. The camera resolution wasn't bad but the wireless trasmition wwas unusable. It only had a stable image if I had the camera 3 inches away from the reciever making the wireless feature pointless. As soon as I moved the camera away from the reciever the image started jumping and making pullsing noise. Unusable equipment...I then called customer service and got a guy that didn't asked a single question about why I wanted to return the camera (in case that cam was faulty) and didn't know much about refund procedures works (in terms of paying half Gift Cert. half credit c.) and told me to call Amazon.Don't buy this camera, specially from these guys."
3,Jesus Take the Wheel,This better have some kind of effect because these things are like DINOSAUR EGGS. Dinosaur eggs that graze your gullet.I'll update this in a month provided I don't choke to death
3,I've seen better,I felt like I relieved myself quite frequently on these pills but I cant say I lost any noticeable weight. I've taken better pills for appetite suppressants and better cleansers so I'll just rate it sub par...
1,4th Faucet in 51 months,"We purchased this faucet in May 2006. It leaked by March 2007, when I called to complain, I was told that was a common problem. Price Pfister sent a replacement faucet. The Ceramic Disc Cartridge failed in August 2010. The replacement part Price Pfister sent was defective. I am now requesting another replacement part. That makes the 3rd problem with this faucet in 51 months."
2,falling faucet handle,"I want to complain about the handle which falls down and inadvertently turns the water off. You have to turn on the water at a high flow rate so that the handle will not fall. I also understand that other people have had this problem, It's quite annoying. I am now contacting the manufacturer to either send me a new faucet that has this defect eliminated, or send me a refund."
4,Good but advanced,Ordered this book because it was on the reading list for our homeschool co op. my son was in third grade and It was over his head. I would recommend it for 6 th grade and up. It was enjoyable and well written!
4,Well received treat,My dog loved these and I think they probably helped with his gas and dare I say his breath too.
3,Good book overall.,"Just finished a nuclear physics course where we used Krane and got to chapter 11. Overall it is a very good book and detailed. My biggest problem was with answering some of the questions because often for the rate that the course was going, I would spend to much time trying to determine what the question was asking or wanting. I also dislike that there is no way to check any of your answers other than through your professor. However, great book for the most part, very detailed if not to detailed at some point. It even gives a little quick review of the history in each chapter."
5,"Well, more like 4 and a half","Very interesting book. There are twists and turns you wouldn't expect unless you read the back cover first. And we come to why it's only 4 1/2 instead of five. The back gives it all away!It does compare to ""Geek Love"" (a book that should also be picked up if your stomach can take it) but in a more appealing way. You could read this in almost three sittings as we go over the three stages in his life we get to witness.My suggestion; read this then ""Geek Love"" and don't read the back cover!"
2,504 boys-explicit lyrics,"I think the unedited version is much better. Plus, there is more than just one good song on this CD I would rather have an unedited full CD"
5,Equus 3130 Diagnostic Code Scanner,"This is a fantastic product. I have used it many times on my personal vehicles as well as friends and family cars, its more than paid for its self. The live data and record feature is very handy only if you know what your looking for. Most people who just want a code reader could bypass this and get the next model down without any loss of function. I found the users manual easy to read and understand. The scanner and included hardware are all of good quality, a case is a must to protect it. Anybody who has a 96 and newer vehicle should invest in a Equus code scanner."
5,Very Pleased,I am very pleased with this product. It helped me solve my check engine light problem. Works excellent. Great software.
3,Decent scanner,It served its purpose of a basic scan tool to gather codes. It did quit working after a year. You get what you pay for.
1,Good Machine Bad Company,This machine was 2 days old bought new and I received an email to upgrade it for ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Also a cable promised in multiple emails missing from the package was supposed to be DROPPED IN THE MAIL 2 months ago!!!!!!!!!Still nothing received.I would be very careful buying this company's products even though the machineseems to work well on my JeeP Grand Cherokee.I STILL do not have the ability to download and save my vehicles correct settings to this day.I have sent the company my address responding to an email asking for it a total of 14 times now.These people who lose jobs in this economy really need to get to WORK!!!!!!Did you ever hear an illegal alien complain about working?You wonder why these companies are in such trouble.I may keep this machine but I will NEVER BUY another from this company!!RC
1,Piece of Dog Squeeze,"The cable you will get with this tool will not work after using it a couple of times, because pin 16 will short out and that is your power source. And Tech support is to dam stupid to not just give you a new one they want you to send in your scanner so they can screw it up too. Well I can buy a new one from them at $52.00 dollars or replace the connector myself not a good proposition if it does not work. DO NOT BUY THIS TOOL."
4,Scanner,The scanner worked as promised .The only thing was I had no place to plug the scanner in on my computer. To solve the problem I bought an adapter plug from the nine pin on the scanner wire to a USB which I can plug into the computer.I'm still working on getting past just reading error codes and clearing the check engine light.
2,Doesn't work with Audi,"From all of the reviews of this product, I thought I was getting the top-of-line scanner that would work with any vehicle. I have US-made, Asian-made, and German-made cars. From what I can tell, it does not work with my 1998 Audi A4. I have tried different connection combinations, vehicle key positions, standing on my head, etc with no luck. I will be returning it to Amazon tomorrow. But,...From what I can tell, this does seem to be a very nice unit if it will work with your vehicle. It has all of the features that I was looking for. I just need one that will work with my Audi."
4,Good for various levels of yoga,"I happened to come across this DVD at my local library. I tired it out and determined I'd like to own it. Unlike many yoga DVD's it has a farily quick pace and it shows you poses at various levels of ability. This is a good program for those that are still newer to yoga yet it has quite a few advanced poses. This is a program that you can grow with as it isn't only a beginner's program. It will take me quite some time to advance to some of the poses - which is exactly what I was looking for. Also, the DVD has a few different sections to choose from so you can custom tailor your workout."
4,Carl Magnus Palm's in depth book on the band ABBA,"Having been an ABBA fan for years, I was aware of this book, and had read some professionally written reviews about it in the past. I haven't read all the book yet, but it's interesting to find out what goes on behind the scenes with ABBA as individuals. One could assume this kind of book could apply just as well to other big name groups such as the Beatles, etc. The book is very detailed, and 551 pages long with a small type face. It could overwhelm a casual reader, but for a hard core ABBA fan, it would probably reveal some information to that fan they did not know. Thank you."
4,Sure is thorough...,"Exhaustively researched, this weighty tome is for the certifiable ABBAmaniac only. Casual fans looking for a frothy snapshot of the sunny Swedes would be well-advised to keep looking. Ultimately, gloomier than a Jonkoping February."
4,Good pants,"The pants seem to be good quality, but I've only had them 1 month. They fit well and were as described. I would recommend."
3,Great pants but dont last long,"i am on my third pair of pants. They wear great, fit great, wash great and feel great. I love them, obviously or I wouldnt be on my third pair. My biggest problem with them is that they wear thin and eventually tear at the right seat pocket. This pair was less than ninety days old and I noticed a slit right across the bottom of the pocket. The pants are like new except for this wear at the pocket. I cant afford to keep buying them when they last less than ninety days. If they would last and not tear on the right seat pocket, I would have to give them five plus stars. I cannot say that I will replace my last pair with another pair of this brand."
3,krista allen shines brightly,"though the movie wasn't too good, krista allen was amazing as usual. i love her, and she made the movie get all 3 stars that i gave it. miss allen is so lovely, and i love her. if anyone wants a copy, i have some. yesmaam27@hotmail.com"
3,product description,"According to the American Power Conversion Corp website:Maximum height dimensions 8.50 inches ( 21.59 cm)Maximum width dimensions 2.50 inches ( 6.35 cm)Maximum depth dimensions 2.00 inches ( 5.08 cm)3-prong Attachment, 4 International Plug Adapters, Convenient Carrying Case, Space-saving Coiled Cord"
3,The Fair Sex fails to leave much of an impression.,"I've got ""Machine Bites"" and I've listened to it several times, but it fails the leave me with a strong, lasting impression. The music was industrial with guitars, but not incredibly heavy guitars. The song ""Casket Tower"" seemed to be the only one that stuck out as being interesting enough to warrant more listening time. This album is a compilation of previously released material from their various older albums. Unfortunately, if this is a reliable cross-section of The Fair Sex's work, I find it rather disappointing. It's not bad, but it's down the spectrum from good..."
2,I feel for the people who live next to this band's space,"While this album has some fantastic artwork, I do have a fewissues with the sound the pigeons have. It sounds like theyput some people on some instruments that didn't know how toplay and were told ""make a lot of noise"". The lead singerSpencer Rangitsch does have the scream-lyric down, that's forsure. The last five tracks are listed as ""Live"" but I can'thear anything in those tracks to distinguish them from thenon-live tracks, or from any of the other tracks for that matter.This album would be the perfect listening complement for someonewho has listened to too much Barbara Streisand and is lookingfor a change of scenery."
5,"Sound Body, Sound Mind, A Healing Experience!","I listened to the beautiful healing music of ""Sound Body, Sound Mind"", preparing myself for surgery. The music lifted my spirits and gave me courage. During my operation, though unconscious, I had headphones on, the tape on continuous play and I listend to the music on a deeper level. After surgery, I had the music on continuous play during recovery and during the night as I slept. The music invigorated me. I woke at 3:00 AM one night full of joy and happiness, not the usual fear and loneliness one usually experiences in the middle of the night at a hospital. I have continued to listend to the music at home, at least twice a day, while recovering. This wonderful music brought me peace and joy. I thank Dr. Weil and all those who put it together. I have been telling everyone I meet about the healing properties of this wonderful music."
5,I LOVE this book!,"When I was in elementary school, this book was in our school library. I checked it out whenever I could. Now, as a young adult, I bought this book and I read it to my babysittees! They actually love it and ask me to read it all the time! This book has important information about presidents along with silly anecdotes and facts about them. Very entertaining and educating.Did you know that Taft was the first president to get stuck in the White House bathtub? That Andrew Jackson once chased an assassination attempter with his cane? That Coolidge rode a mechanical horse in the White House? There's so much more!!"
2,"Killa Season, yea it's killa season for my ears. He' dis owned himshelf from dipset with this f up so called album.!!","He didn't try with album, he put out anything and expects to cell cause' he wit dipset.The only good songs is touch it or not and Wet Wipes.Becouse of this album Imight not check out his other album.I rest my case."
3,TIMING CAN BE A KILLA......,ACCUALLY THIS IS NOT A BAD ALBUM ITS JUST THAT THE DIPSET MIXTAPE CIRCUIT IS SO STRONG THAT IT MAKES THE ALBUM APPEAR OLD. PUSIN THE RELEASE AND RELEASING THE MOVIE HURT THE ALBUM SALES. THATS WHERE THEY GO PLATINUM CAUSE THEY CONSTANTLY PUT OUT OFFICIAL IN STORES MIXTAPES AND STREET MIXTAPES SO MOST OF THE SONGS WERE HEARD ALREADY. SOME AT LEAST 2 OR 3 MONTHS AGO AND HE STILL HAD SOME DO OVERS WITH SOMETHIN' NEW AND GET 'EM DADDY BUT THOSE REMAKES ALSO PREVIOUSLY GOT AIRPLAY SO THEY WERE OLD ALSO. THATS MY OPINION.I'LL GIVE CAM 3.5 STARS ON THIS ONE.
2,Disappointed... Very dissapointed...,"I'm gonna be very honest with y'all on here. I wasn't impressed about this Killa Season album. I only liked ""He Tried To Play Me"" and ""Get Em Daddy (Remix)"". I couldn't believe that I wasted almost $20 on it!!! I was really pissed when I listened to this album. Now I know next time before I get another album, especially a Cam'Ron album, that I will listen to the samples on Amazon or CD Universe first. It's not that Cam'Ron is a bad lyricist, in which I don't think he is that bad. But I really think that this whole album for the most part needs a makeover or something. The production and most of the lyrics are just... Trash! Cam step yo game up man!!! I give this album a 1.5 of 5 stars."

1,The Little Prince - BBC Opera,"I did not like it at all. It is dificult to listen to, has little kid-interest, and completely leaves out the profound text that has made theoriginal book translation in English one of those rare 'children's books' that has a vast depth of meaning one can appreciate as they grow older.It was colorful, loud, oversung operatically...which turns kids off. I gave my copy to the library, which I doubt will become well-received bychildren, there. I also bought the new translation of the book, and found the language to be harsh in comparison to the first English translation. I am a grandfather, a former teacher, and would not recomend this new edition of the book, either."
3,Sequel to the Stre Trek novel Dreadnought.,"This novel continues the adventures of a new character in the Star Trek universe: Lt. Commander Piper.The novel itself deals with a topic that was hot at the time:Transwarp. If you can get past the techno-babble, it is fairly good reading.Not a traditional Original Series novel."
5,EXCELLENT BOOK,Just when you thougt No Limit did everything Kane & Able come out with a book. I didn't get it yet but I know it going to have some deep stories. Keep making that dough.
5,IT WAS AMAZING!,"I HAVE NEVER REALLY BEEN EXPOSED TO THE GHETTO, OR ANY TYPE OF CRIME. AFTER READING THIS NOVEL, I SEEM TO HAVE A MUCH BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF GHETTO LIFE AND THE MENTALITY THAT FOSTERS THE CRIMINAL MIND. I MUST SAY, IF THESE GUYS CONTINUE TO DEVELOP AS WRITERS THEY COULD VERY WELL BE THE NEXT DONALD GOINES OR EVEN BETTER! THE CHARACTERS IN THESE TWO NOVELLAS WERE SO WELL DEFINED IT WAS ALMOST AS IF YOU KNEW THEM YOURSELF. I WAS VERY IMPRESSED BY THE WELL THOUGHT STORIES AND THESE GUYS ARE RAPPERS. IT IS VERY OBVIOUS THAT THESE GUYS ARE NOT ONLY WELL EDUCATED, BUT ALSO VERY STREET SMART. THIS BOOK IS A MUST READ FOR ANYONE WHO LIKES THE TYPE OF BOOK THAT YOU CAN'T PUT DOWN FOR A SECOND. IT IS DEFINITELY A CLASSIC, AND SOLOMON JAMES IS GOING TO GO DOWN IN HISTORY AS A CLASSIC GANGSTER LIKE MICHAEL CORLEONE OR NINO BROWN. ALOT OF MY FRIENDS HAVE READ THIS BOOK AND WE ALL LOVE IT!"
5,I love it,Arrived sooner than expected. Couldn't beat the price all others were too expensive. When I installed it the problem went away.
5,Perfect OE replacement,"Recently purchased Mazda Tribute with 150,000 miles ran really well, but had trouble idling once warm and lousy gas mileage. Replacing both O2 sensors completely fixed the idle and sent the mileage shooting up.This is a perfect OE replacement and fits/works flawlessly"
5,A must have! This live album is amongst the best ever.,"There is seriously not a bad moment on this album. Ryan Shupe and the Rubber Band are simply stunning. This record captures them at their height before they became a major label act. If you want to know why they were signed to a major label, then buy this album.In fact I was asked recently what 10 albums would I take with me to live out the rest of my life and this was one of them. My list was:1. Vangelis - Opera Sauvage2. Verdi Requiem as done by Robert Shaw3. YES - Going For The One4. Mahler Symphony #15. Dave Brubeck - Take 56. Kurt Elling - The Messenger7. Rush - Moving Pictures8. Manhattan Transfer - Vocalese9. The Carpenters - A Christmas Portrait10. Ryan Shupe and The Rubber Band - LiveNine all time classics and then the practically unheard of ""Live"" album from Ryan Shupe & The Rubber Band. I rank this that high."
3,Something for Everyone,"A good concept and well-executed. But for me personally, the variety is just little too wide-ranging. About half the renditions don't really jazz me... seem a bit 'screechy'... as many modern female singers are prone to be. But there is some stuff I like as well. You pays your money and you takes your choice on this one."
1,Doesn't work with iPod Nano,I ordered two of these and neither one works with my iPod Nano. The iPod does not detect them as microphones.
5,from the author,"I think I must be using the wrong form -I am the author of this book, and I would like to provide a list of my other books, could you please tell me how to do this?Thank you, Naomi"
1,Simply Stopped Working....,"I liked this machine fine for about three months, then it suddenly started making squealing sounds (so loud I'd have to leave the room). Shortly thereafter, the paddle took to turning only sporadically. I would take it back, but I lost my receipt. It's an expensive machine, and I purchased it based on good reviews, but I'm very disappointed in its poor quality."
5,longevity and beautiful bread,"I have owned other breadmakers and this Cuisinart is by far the best one I've had to date. It has never given me an inedible loaf and every loaf is beautifully browned and full.Considering a beautiful loaf every time is one of the essentials of a good bread machine, yet I am more satisfied even with the Cusinart's longevity. I have had other machines break within 6 months of purchase, but that is one thing I like about this machine. Simply, Cuisinart lasts. I have had mine for a year now and it keeps going, sometimes making 3 or more loaves per week.For the reasonable price, it is the best machine you can find. I would buy it again if needed. (But I don't need to--and that's the point.)"
1,never had so much trouble with a bread maker,"This is my fifth or sixth breadmaker in ten years (some jumped the counter others just gave up the ghost). I have loved them all, but this Cuisinart is a complete failure. My loaf this morning was finally rising perfectly and then collapsed. This was a birthday gift in september and I have yet to have a successful loaf, not for lack of trying or experimenting. I love bread machines because you can program them and they do the job, this doesn't do the job. It's a rare product failure for cuisinart, but I strongly recommend trying another brand."
1,Don't give a used breadmaker.,"When I received the breadmaker, I was so angry and disappointed that the breadmaker has been used. It is not brand new at all! There were many heavy scratches inside and outside this machine. Furthermore, there are even small pieces of food left inside the oven. I spent money to buy a new breadmaker not a second hand one."
1,Cuisinart Bread Machine,"Just got my new Cuisinart bread machine and made my first loaf of bread. BURNED, BURNED AND BURNED! I used lowest setting too.Just sick for I read that this is a problem after I ordered it and it was on the way. Sure enough! Wasted good ingredients too! Will try again, but hate to risk losing expensive ingredients!"
2,less than thrilled.,"i shouldn't knock the exterior finish because i purchased a refurbished unit. but shouldn't a refurbished piece be better than new? they've had two chances to get it right.well, maybe next time.the baking cycle is useless. no matter what setting you set for the crust you wind up with moist toast. i've learned to remove the loaf before the bake cycle and finish the bread in my oven.this appliance isn't a breadmaker but an expensive mixing bowl. a dented and disfigured one at that."
1,Serious Flaws,"I received my bread maker over the weekend and was so excited to make homemade bread for my husbands birthday party. The first loaf did not rise at all. The mix-in button would not turn off which seemed to have messed everything up. I tried to stop the cycle with about 10 minutes to go and pressed cancel and unplugged the machine. When I started my next loaf, the settings were jammed and the timer still read 10 minutes left. The Cuisinart support person told me that the only way to re-set the machine is to leave it unplugged for at LEAST half an hour to an hour! Two hours later, it hadn't re-set so I was told the machine must be defective.I was really excited about this machine, I own a lot of Cuisinart products and this is one really has the nicest look for my kitchen, but I just don't think I will buy another and risk throwing away pounds more of my organic flour! With no way to STOP the cycle, I just don't think it's worth it."
1,Needs improvement!,I was very disappointed in this product. I made two loaves of bread with it and they were both burnt with the light setting. I have had 2 bread machines before and never had this problem so I returned it. I think they have a problem with this machine I am not the first person with this complaint. I bought it because of the warranty.
4,"Love, love, love...","I typically make one to two bread mixes in this per week, my family loves it, and I'm able to buy wholesome mixes that are preservative and chemical free made with whole grains. Simple to use, timer feature is great for prep ahead for meals or to bake overnight and wake up to fresh bread. I have not had a huge success with recipes from the manual from scratch, but I think that is all me!Edit: It's November 2012. After using the machine regularily (one loaf a week) for about a year, it has begun to give me problems. Sometimes the dough pan hops out of the brackets. I now have to be very careful with heavier mixes, like whole grains. :("
1,Very disappointed,"I am so disappointed in this product that I just spent another $29 to return it to the company. The overall performance was a much poorer quality than bread machines I owned years ago. Out of the eight loaves I made, only two were marginally satisfactory. I followed the directions precisely and used brand new high quality ingredients but even with a simple loaf of banana nut quick bread, the flour was not well mixed into the batter. I had really looked forward to some delicious bread from this machine, but after this unfortunate experience, I think I'll just go back to the tried and true hand kneading method!I would definitely not recommend this product."
2,mzeinstr,"i got this bread maker 2 years ago, which isn't that long ago considering that you do not make bread every day. first, the pan started banging around about 1 year into it, not to mention all the flour that collects in the corners of the bread pan, then just the other day, the paddle quit working. i ordered a new paddle, that didn't help. we took it apart and found that the belt wheel is actually made out of plastic, and this is what turns the paddle. needless to say, the plastic part was worn out and as far as i can find, it can't be replaced. so i would caution anyone buying this bread machine."
3,This baby is loud!!,"I enjoy the product and the features it has, and it makes great bread too. The baking cycle on this thing is soooooo loud! I even called the company and they said it is the way it works. This is my first bread machine so I have no other means to compare. I have to keep it in the basement now when I make bread because in the kitchen you can't hear yourself think! Strong and solid product otherwise."
2,Lots of Beeps and Buttons but Burns the Bread,"I owned a Cuisinart CBK200 for a few weeks and was very impressed with all the extras that it was capable of doing. I loved the stainless steel finish and the horizontal baking pan. It was a heavy duty machine that didn't make a lot of noise while mixing the bread. I loved the bake only feature as well as the backup power failure feature. It had real buttons and not the touch pad which was also a plus. It had plenty of timer beeps to let you know every phase it was going through. So why don't I still have it? Well, it burned up every loaf I made no matter what setting I used. If they could only get the thermostat working right, it would be a winner hands down."
4,Great recipes,Great pizza dough and bread recipees. I like the buzzer to let you take the stirring paddle out before baking. I'm glad to have it.
1,I found the bad reviews to be correct in my case.....,"I decided to go with this breadmaker even after reading the reviews that this machine burns bread. I bought it anyway since it was a cuisinart and some of the reviews were fabulous.The machine I rcvd. unfortunatelly burned about 4 loaves of bread in a row. It was a present for a family member who was SO disappointed! I had to send it back and got a Panasonic, since one of the reviewers did the same thing, and the Panasonic works fine.I don't know if I got a defective machine or if my stepdad just didn't do it right but after 4 loaves he'd had it."
1,Do not buy this product!!,I purchased 2 of these for my daughters. I returned one because after 2 uses it would not turn on. Kept second one and each loaf of bread falls for unknown reasons.
1,Unworthy.,"Unworthy refers to the book, not the horses. The book is really thin, in both content and intensity. The first chapter was exciting and well written (in the vein of Nack's ""Secretariat""). The rest, however, is poorly written and put together and ends as anti-climactically as the rivalry between Affirmed and Alydar. The price is simply too much. I was surprised that the author, who seems to have the credentials, wrote stumbling sentences and never seemed to believe in the two horses."
3,"Great songs, good performances, bad recording","I must echo previous reviewers: The engineering on this live record is quite subpar. Instrumental balances are terrible. But enough of the negative.I saw the band live during this period and remember the experience as being awesome; Brooker played and sang his heart out, Wilson took drumming to a whole new level, and the rest of the band were tight and expressive. Here, however, the performances seem a tad off kilter. Not terrible, mind you, but perhaps the poor recording has something to do with this impression.In my opinion, this album is only for completists and collectors. For a true taste of this band's accomplishments on a live recording, get In Concert With the Edmonton Symphony Orchestra, where Procol Harum make it seem as if rock was meant to be played with a full orchestra and chorus."
5,"Loud, Rude and well, Neil","One of my favorite Neil albums (along with On the Beach) reissued. While not necessarily his greatest lyrics, the theme SERENITY runs throughout. Crazy Horse rocks hard and loud, more so than anything else between Live Rust and Ragged Glory. Often lumped in with horrible ""Life"" album, this is NY&CH at some of their best."
1,GodAwful,"How can the people above give this 4 stars? There is one song on it ""T-Bone"" where he repeats the same lines over and over. That ain't song writng. Never see Bob Dylan write something like that. You know it stinks becasue I've never seen Neil play any of the songs from this album live."
3,Another Neil Experiment....for the die hards mostly,"Reactor has it's moments but it's not for everyone. Lots of guitar and punk/new wave influence but not much in the way of songs. T-bone has one line of lyrics ""got mashed potatoes, ain't got no t-bone."" Chalk it up as a fairly interesting but not too successful experiment."
1,Neil Young's Worst Album?,"One can only hope that ""Rapid Transit"" and ""T-Bone"" are self-parody. I read that his major concern when the album was Re*Cord*Ed was to play the ""Loudest f***ing thing"" that he could. If you want to complete your Young collection, I recommend making this one your last purchases. There are too many good ones to waste your money on this one."
5,Awesome Fixture,"The hubby and I were having the guest bath remodelled. We were going for modern, zen, but the bathroom is quite dark. This fixture adds just the right touch of modern and the halogen bulbs give us LOTS of light. It's wonderful to actually see our new, remodelled bath. This is a great looking fixture and a good value."
4,Cyborgs. Why did it have to be cyborgs?,"If there's one thing Steve Alten has, its range. He's able to constantly surprise in his books. Even to the point of making old, used plot twists seem new. As characters change alliances, it almost feels as though its the first time you've seen this happen in a book. Its hard to see what's coming next. Goliath is really an interesting book. Its filled with characters that are constantly changing, mutating, becoming something more than what they started out as. If I could make only one complaint about this book, it would be the amount of gore and gruesome imagery. But in fact, that's hardly a complaint at all. It helps to draw the reader into the story. It isn't often that a book has such a power to move me. Even if its moving me in an uncomfortable direction. I would suggest Goliath to those looking for a good action/adventure story with believable characters and a story that seems to keep evolving right along with the submarine's AI, Sorceress."
5,Alten Rules!,"Just when you think Alten's writing cannot possibly get any better, he creates another masterpiece. His writing radiates with artistry, knowledge and ultimate perfection.I have read every book he has written, and they keep getting better. He consummates brilliance and skill. Sparking your enthusiasm for... and leaving you with a thirst for more...Producers and directors should be knocking down this guy's door for movie rights. Could you imagine seeing Goliath on the big screen."
1,A political lecture,"Masculine armed soldiers with square jaws and jet-propelled ships invade a lush planet inhabited by dewy-eyed tadpole creatures who rely on green energy to get around. Get it yet ?!!In other words, ""Avatar"".So many movies today are 2-dimensional political lectures these days, and this one is one of the most extreme examples. If you a 14 year old girl living, or you live in Vermont or San Francisco, you will probably like this.I hit ""eject"" at about minute 34."
4,"A good movie, for adults.","The storyline and animation are very good. The theme, earthman invaders, is for adult consumption, and not great for children. If you overlook the sharp criticism of humanity, it is an enjoyable movie."
1,Awful,"Where to begin... I had the unfortunate experience to watch this unbelievable awful film. If you are able to get past even the basic laws of physics then you are in for an hour and twenty minutes of pain. Clearly the films writers and director are deep down inside ashamed of themselves or really who they perceive the human race to be. The idea that someone would turn on their own kind because of a brief interaction with a alien race is disgusting.Their sad lack of writing, direction, and deep down self loathing, are what kill a movie with excellent animation and potential. the fact a studio released this movie after viewing it makes me sad and believe morons run the studio."
4,An interesting take,"There's nothing all that new about the story itself. It's Avatar, and so many stories before that. The thing that makes this movie superior to the Miners vs. Blue Cats adventure is that there's a real believable motivation for the human characters. It's one thing to be rapacious going after natural resources - of course we would do that, because we do that now - but at some point, we would just cut our losses and go home. If the humans in Avatar didn't have that option, if there was no Earth left, then you'd have the much more complicated moral and ethical dilemma of this film."
4,Essential Jobim,"I prefer the subtle and melancholy magic of ""Wave,"" but ""Tide"" is pure and essential Jobim. Every track is outstanding, but the album as a whole lacks the underlying melancholic beauty of ""Wave."" It occasionally swings (i.e. sections of ""Garota de Ipanema"") and I think that this detracts from the laid-back flavour that I've come to know and love from Jobim.Still, make no mistake-- this is an incredible album (a classy reissue as well!), and belongs in the collection of anyone interested in bossa-nova."
4,A Worthwhile Jazz Classic From Jobim,"A kind of brother-album to WAVE, this album starts out strong with a good instrumental rendition of the classic ""Girl From Ipanema."" It has some nice mellow tracks like ""Sue Ann,"" and the title track ""Tide,"" which is really wonderful. Add to that some amazing improvisational/experimental voiced flute work, some really snappy tracks like ""Remember,"" and several takes of ""Tema Jazz,"" and you get an album that is really worth the money--especially because it has four more tracks than the original, if my math is correct. When I purchased it, it was called TIDE+4, but now it seems to be the main version for sale. I'd rank this album below Jobim's WAVE and STONE FLOWER, which I think are more important and better works, but this one definitely makes my Bossa top ten list. Take it from the Neophyte: buy this album!"
3,Thin on style and content.,"I agree with a previous reviewer that this book, while informative, is rather thin on style. I get the impression that Strobel, with his engineering background, isn't the best at explaining some of the simple yet critically important details in the violin-making process. Some of the more obvious steps are illustrated and explained, yet some of the more obscure and complicated things are practically glossed over, which can be extremely frustrating for a beginner. For example, when cutting sound-holes there are certain directions in which the wood must be cut, or it will splinter and break. That fact is not even mentioned in this book. A beginner simply cannot rely on any one of Strobel's books as a complete reference on the subject -- he or she will have to look elsewhere as well."
3,Satisfying and light,"A satisfying light romance. Meets all the requirements for light reading, with some real historical settings added in. Fun read!"
3,The fine line between arty and weird...,"On Simple Minds' third album, the Scottish band takes a step back from their mind-blowing sophomore release, ""Reel to Reel Cacophony.""First, the good news: ""Empires and Dance"" contains two incredible tracks: the ground-breaking 80s dance anthem ""I Travel,"" and the eerie, hand-clapping ""Celebrate."" These two tracks are stellar examples of early techno and dark new wave. However, both are available on the compilation album ""Early Gold,"" so I recommend that instead.The rest of the album is well, grossly overrated, and crosses well over the line between art and weirdness. The second half of the album, in particular, sounds like the soundtrack for a hellish art installation built of jagged, rusty metal.Fortunately, Simple Minds would bounce back with its next release, ""Sons and Fascination/Sister Feeling Call."" That epic double set would achieve the quality and consistency lacking on this outing."
1,watch what your children read!!!,"I have to say, parents be sure to watch what your children read! a young girl in my family (14) read this book and became so into it that she actually thought it happened to her! by her own brother! and due to this she actually filed a police report and put him in jail for a month and probation for two years! and he also has to attend sex offender classes for two months after this was all over she admitted she lied about it because she wanted attention and she got the idea from this book! so always monitor your chldrens reading material"
1,Phone stops ringing,"I have a VOIP setup with voicepulse. This phone works great as long as I don't assign phone numbers to the presets. When I do it stops ringing after a few days. The lights flash indicating an incoming call and I can answer the phone if I notice the lights flashing but it doesn't ring. If I reset the phone to defaults, erasing all presets, then it works OK. I got a new one from AT&T and it does the same thing. I love the headset button to switch between speaker and headset. Let me know if you know a workaround."
1,speakerphone has problems,"I purchased 3 of these for my office back in October. First the speakerphone microphone on the one on my desk stopped working most of the time. I had been planning on exchanging the phone on my desk with a coworkers since I use the speakerphone on a daily basis. My investors were out this week and were on a conference call on another of the phones, that microphone stopped working. Today I had a phone interview and the THIRD phone microphone stopped working! They work for 15 or 20 seconds, then the party on the other end can't hear you. These are gone. I was also hoping for a visual indicator that there were messages waiting when you use Verizon Centrex/voicemail. No go there."
3,Be Careful,"Ok so I bought this tonite for my son. I figured I take it out of the package and transform it into Anakin. Yeah, I needed the directions. Which is ok, I expected that. But I've spent the last 2 hours looking at them, trying to decide if maybe somehow they put this one together wrong. It doesn't seem to want to flip where it shows it should. Maybe the directions are wrong? Maybe I'm wrong? Anyway I have done it a couple of times and I can see the plastic starting to stress, so I may have to take it back for a different one.I feel silly, it's a kids toy that shouldn't be THAT complicated, so I'm really hoping it's the toy and not me being dumb.So, just read the directions first. That's all."
3,good,I like this one because it totally match my TESOL class and I feel good about it.Please recommend this to your friends.
4,Wonderful mood pieces,Beautiful voices in both Requiem and Magnificat bring out the wonderful melodies. It will have you singingalong and long after.
2,Disappointing vocal performance,"Though the instrumental performance is adequate, I was quite disappointed with the choral performance in the requiem. The group's diction is not together, several of the soloists are weak, and the overall balance of choir and orchestra is not even."
4,Good and Fast!,"It was in good condition, the only thingI didn't like I got it in a bag. It could damage the book. Fortunately, it was in good condition. Andi got it Fast!"
4,"product good, shipping long","It took about two and a half weeks to ship, which I felt was a little too long. However, the book was in the condition described and met my expectations. Overall, I am satisfied with this seller and this purchase."
3,Would you like some Filtered House?,"This cd is mixed by Los Angeles DJ's Tony B! and DJ Groove.The tracks on this mix cd are very good, but what loses points is the mixing and editing. You could hear too many cuts on where the tracks were cut and sliced. I just felt it was too noticeable. I have heard other mixes from Tony B! and thought he could have done alot better.Mix One-DJ Tony B!This mix is more of the filtered house with songs by Robbie Rivera, Hatiras, Subsonik.The mix has good energy and stays consistent. Songs such as aphrodisiac, funk master, o train, digital doom are the stand out tracks.Overall Rating for Mix: 3.5Mix Two-DJ GrooveThis mix is more about the vocal disco house with songs by Ron Carroll, Paul Johnson, Kevin Irving, JJ. The track selection on this mix is very good. Has very popular tracks such as: Get Get Down, Reach Up, House Aint Giving Up, Funk Return. It is mixed well with the exception of the editing errors.Overall Rating for Mix 3.5Overall Rating 3.5"
3,Not an exact fit for a 1986 Porsche 944 na,I didn't ready well. Does anyone want it? It isn't a direct fit for a 1986 Porsche 944 na. I didn't want to re-wire the car to make it fit. Brand new in the box.
5,"""Fantastic work stephen""","This book was exellent! the only thing wrong was it was written as a screen-play but it was awsoeme. If you like stephen king this is the book to get. the plot was in maine in a town called ""LITTLE TALL"" and it was great.This guy named ""LINOGE"" was terrorizing the whole town and he killed a bunch of people. if you like horror this is the one to get!"
3,Good book but be careful...,I really enjoyed this book but I was un-prepared to find it a screen play rather than a novel. Thats tricky as its billed as a Novel.... a screenplay is much different. Be careful....
4,Great plot!,"I bought this book a few months ago not realizing it was a screenplay. I tried to read it then, but lost interest, because it was a screenplay. I picked it up again last night and just now put it down! Very well written. Once you get past the fact that it is a screenplay you get totally lost in the characters. The ending was surprising, because I thought the townspeople would make a different choice. King seems to know how people would react to certain situations. We all like to think we are basically good, but deep down we are selfish. This isn't up there with THE SHINING or 'SALEM's LOT, but it is very well written, and I highly recommend it."
3,A book written on the darker side of Stephen King,"I am an avid Stephen King fan. I have every book that he has written and have ridden out several phases in his writing. Overall, the book was very good, and just finished viewing the screenplay; however, I am not overly happy with the ending. In all previous books, good always triumphs over evil. I cannot believe that Mr. King let evil win. Is this the darker side of Stephen King? I hope not..."
4,Half read it but...,"I'm reading it right now and I find it an enthralling story, yes, Linoge is a creepy character and it just keeps you wondering. However I have one complain that infuriates me?. Why should Mike Anderson, being a talented man as he is, marry a woman so plainly stupid like Molly?. This character definetly repulses me from continue my reading. The overall is Ok, it's fast paced and creepy but this character IMHO damages the story. I only hope she dies before the end of the book."
1,Nonstick surface disintegrate,"The nonstick surface of this pan started to peel off into our food, kind of like peeling paint, within a couple of months of purchase. Definitely do not buy this pan. I've had lots of pans with non-stick surfaces and I've never seen anything like this. It made an otherwise nice sized pan, with good weight, unusable."
3,Waterproof but no great shakes,I bought these ones with my Sony Sports discman. I always had a problem. When doing good exercise sweat got the better of my earphones. SO these made sense. But when God opens one door he closes another(sorry for the inversion). Even though these offer good waterproofing the sound quality leaves a lot to be desired. SO therefore the 3 star rating. The sound was not crisp and there was no great bass too.
5,The best shampoo for me,"I have really sensitive skin--in fact, this summer, when I switched to a different shampoo brand on vacation I wound up with a rash all over my back from rinsing it off. Yuck!I also have really dry, brittle hair (not processed or treated, and I don't use a hairdryer--it's just dry by its nature) so I had a heck of a time finding a shampoo that was gentle and conditioning *and* didn't irritate my skin. Finally, about four years ago, I found this shampoo and (except for the occasional, vacation-induced experiment) I've used nothing else. My hair looks great--shiny, smooth, and healthy--and has lots of natural body and bounce.No one shampoo will work for everyone, but I think this one's well worth a try if you have hair that's on the delicate side."
2,didn't do anything to my hair,I bought this product because I was looking for a leave in conditioner and after reading the reviews I decided to give a try. Let me say its smells awful and it didn't do anything to my hair.
3,No visible affect,"The frizz continued to be there, hair did not feel soft or anything. I would rate L'Oreal Paris EverStrong Hydrate Shampoo much above this one!"
1,I HATE this stuff,"I bought this based on the rave reviews.I thought because it's so difficult to find in stores, it must be a big seller.After using it, my guess is, it'll probably be taken off the market.It's awful.Made my hair DRY and the ends brittle.But after looking at the ingredients on the bottle, I shouldn't be surprised.Alcohol and SODIUM HYDROXIDE .. ?? LYE? To FRY my hair???Are you kidding.No more for me!!"
4,hair works,My wife has very long hair and says this is the only product that works for her. she recently could not find it any longer in the stores and asked if I could buy it on line for her. Of course Amazon listed it at a reasonable price-say no more.
5,"Getting into the book, its really interesting..","Just wanted to know how to make my life much easier and smoother living with someone who has an addiction. Reading the book along with a few other books along the way helps me to understand what they are thinking and doing. I am right on with what I see and why my husband does what he does. Great book that explains many things I've wanted to know.Lets stick together and feel we aren't the reason they drink. We can help them and I am willing to do that. Hard sometimes but if you love them enough, you can help them too."
4,good choice!,"The camcorder was received rather quickly and we really do like it. For a non-techy the camcorder was very easy to understand immediately. The only two drawbacks are the quality of picture isn't top notch and recording in not so bright of a setting is not too good. However, overall I think this is a great camera for the price."
3,Great VHSc replacement,"This is a great inexpensive camcorder. MUCH easier than our VHSc camcorder that has been sitting in its bag for 5 years now and also better than the short videos we can record on our digital camera. After you are done you can just ""finalize"" the DVD, put in in your DVD player and watch the movie.I blank miniDVD-R are inexpensive (I got 50 for $20) and very easy to store.One minor complaint. The ""finalize"" option is only available if the camcorder is plugged into wall power. This is no problem but there is no way to know that unless you read the small comment burried in the manual somewhere that mentions that. Having that comment on the camcorder ""finalize"" menu would have been a lot more stright-forward."
4,buena compra,"compre una camara usada, la recibi en poco tiempo antes de lo previsto ,muy buen precio y casi nueva tal como la describio volvere a usar este vendedor lo recomiendo"
2,Sold past expiration date.,"Item was sold past expiration date. Went ahead and used product anyhow. Also, I think I purchased the wrong type of dressing. Emphasis is on hydrocolloid...not alginate. I still have 3 left in the original packaging that I didn't use-"
5,Not your typical 80s tripe,"This album transcends the 80s genre. Every song is amazing. Give me a break.... I loved this album (yes, I have the gold vinyl platter) and listening to it again reminds me 1. why i loved it and 2. I was right to love it. This album by Simple Minds rocks!!!"
4,a wonderfully varied record,"Made up of just two people, Blusom manages to make a wonderful pop record with their record second release ""The Metapolitan"". While most of the songs are folk based, the backing instrumentation is what usually makes the record so special. Jme, the multi-instrumentalist, keeps the record fresh at every turn with his multi-layered production ideas. ""The Ticks: Tick, Tick"" is probably the most obvious standout track with it's laid back summer feel. It's a great listen."
2,Water!,"This is an absolutely wonderful product and very beautiful. The huge complaint I have is when opening the top to clean, water runs everywhere. It's a big enough hassle that I am looking for a different coffee maker. Does anyone have a suggestion about the water dripping? I can't believe they didn't design that part better."
1,Leaked.,"No matter what we did, we ended up with water under the unit. Had to keep a kitchen towel under it so the ""look"" was worthless because it always looke This was a poor design. I was relieved when it broke, which it did after a few years. It did make good coffee though."
1,This stopped working after 7 months,"I purchase this coffee maker 7 months ago. When I went to use it this morning and it was completely dead. Some complete electrical malfunction. Called Cuisinart and was told they will not cover it under warranty because it was purchased from Big Lots even though I was told when I purchased it that the warranty was the same as if I purchased it anywhere else. Needless to say, I would not recommend this coffee maker. I expect a whole lot more that 7 months when I purcase something and I expect the company that manufactured it to stand by it. I will never purchase a Cuisinart product again. It was clear from talking to Cuisinart that they weren't surprised that it completely malfunctioned and I couldn't have been more unimpressed with a company. This is way too expensive a product to have such a poor lifespan."
2,Lasted 1 year,"This product worked great for about a year, then I went downstairs one morning to have my coffee and it never turned on. After checking the outlet and circuit breaker I figured out the coffee make wasn't working anymore. As mentioned in previous reviews their is a known problem with the machine, which I found out today after looking around for a new coffee maker. The lid builds up steam and runs down the back when you open the lid. Apparently the water gets into the machine somewhere and burns out the electrical system. Other than not working anymore it was nice a machine while it lasted."
1,Had 2 - both quit within 8 months,"We bought this coffee maker and loved he coffee - suddently wouldn't turn on after about 8 months. They sent me a new one - same deal, about 8 months later, wouldn't turn on. Bought a Bunn 2 months ago - great coffee, great coffee maker at this point. Will never buy a Cuisinart again."
1,Quit working within a year,"This product, while slightly pleasing to the eye, is absolute garbage. First, the hole to pour the water in is very small (think silver dollar diameter). If you enjoy wiping up water spills this model is for you! Secondly, mine shut down within one year of service. After several calls to the service center I was eventually told to send it in for repair. The kicker was I was asked to pay for shipping both ways.(keep in mind less than one year old). So ask yourself this question: is my hard earned money worth a $100 dollar coffee maker that has low ratings?"
2,Worked great for 8 months,This model brewed a good cup of coffee while it worked. Then after 8 months is just stopped working. It would occasionally work if you unplugged it for a while and plugged it back in. But now it is dead. Don't think I'll be buying another at the high cost. Just get a cheap one.
4,A real eyecatcher,"Like other Cuisinart products, this unique coffee maker is dependable, durable, and makes a great cup of coffee. Because it has no carafe, it's a conversation piece. Cleaning and putting water back in are a little more effort than our former Cuisinart...but we're still very happy with the machine"
5,Love this coffee maker,"We are serious about good coffee and this maker provides just that. But the added convenience of the the on- demand feature is a major bonus. No carafe to rinse, no coffee spills on the counter. It sounds like a small thing, but you'd be amazed how much tidier the kitchen stays with this machine. We have had no problem, as mentioned in an earlier review with a ""plastic"" taste to the coffee.... But we did run the whole system several times with plain water before making our first pot. The single down side we have found is that you can't fit a tall ""go"" container under the spout, so if you're one of those who's always taking coffee with you, this probably won't be the maker for you."
1,Loved it while it lasted...but it didn't last too long!,It's a great looking coffee pot and very easy to use/clean. Makes amazing coffee but stopped working suddenly after about 6 months of daily use. Don't bother...
2,ON/OFF Switch Problems,"After 12 months of use, the On/Off switch is defective, rendering the machine inoperable. Other reviewers have had similar failure in 3 months so I think Cuisinart has a problem with these units. I like the the design a lot but 12 months of light use is not enough to justify the price."
1,DCC 2000 Fails Second Time,"Nice unit ... when it works. The first unit failed, just as the second unit is failing. Life expectancy is just over a year. Seems to be an IC board problem; poor/cheap components, high failure rate. The unit begins to power off inadvertantly, or after setting timer, clock , auto off feature. Reset (1 hour power off) didn't help. Unit cannot be serviced. Customer service of no help and inflexible this time. My old DeLonghi, which is over 5 years old and by far less expensive, is back in use. A premium price does not make a premium product. Cuisinart just lost a good customer! And I'm passing the word!"
4,Cuisinart Dcc-2000 Coffee-On-Demand,Over-all it is a very nice coffee maker. It would be nice if the company would supply a pitcher to measure & pour the water.Water runs down the back of the unit when you open the lid (messy). It is a little cumbersome to clean out especially if it is still hot.
3,Kind of gimicky,"this is an ok coffee maker. It makes good coffee. it is rather big and has a big footprint on the counter. It keeps the coffee very hot. However, it is difficult to fill with water, you have to use another cup to fill it since it is too large to carry to the sink. It is not easy to clean either, since the pot part is deep and full of little places in it, it's very deep and even the dishwasher does not get it very clean. It comes with a charcoal filter, but the replacements are too expensive."
1,I remember it well,Bought about 18 months ago. Thought it was a fantastic design and the coffee was good. Beginning four months ago it had to be unplugged/replugged to use it. Today it died for good; this is not the kind of life I expected this maker to have. It was so young and taken too soon.
2,"Great product design, but bad manufacturing","I love the product design, but the machine was broken on me twice. I received it as a Christmas gift. The first coffeemaker lasted for 11 months and one day just quit working. I went to department store, where the machine was purchased, for exchange since it was under warranty. I got a new machine exactly the same modle, but the second machine broken again after 1 year. I had many different coffeemakers before, and this is my first cuisinart coffeemaker. But this is the only coffeemaker has so many troubles. Too bad :-("
1,It just quit!,Ive only had this coffee maker for 7 months. I would have problems with the turn on knob. This morning it decided to not work at all. The light would come on but the water would not go through the piping. Something electrical I figure. And the help desk was not helpful. I wouldnt buy this product unless you want to waste your money...
1,Good coffee but bad design,"Just like so many others...it quit working consistently. Unplugging and replugging would reset it, most of the time, but... Anyway, I called today and, since the coffee maker is on backorder, they waived the shipping fee and, instead of having to ship them the coffee maker, all they want is the cord. Hopefully, the replacement will have been redesigned.Called again today, still on backorder. I was offered the 14-cup with a carafe as a replacement and I took it. Better than waiting forever...."
1,Low quality and Unreliable,I have had this coffee make for just a couple years and I have had to have it replace under warrenty for the electornic controls that would just stop working. The second one did the similar things and would require it to be unpluged for 15-30 minutes to reset. It eventually stopped working all togethter. The warrenty requires the owner to pay shipping both directions and they have to recieve the bad one before shipping out a refurb. It took almost a month. I would not recommed buying this product.
5,Good Java,"We have had one of these for over a year. It is easy to clean,(you don't have to be afraid of breaking a carafe), and makes a good cup of coffee. The coffee stays at a good hot temp for quite a while.Good purchase!"
2,Very Unreliable,"This is a terrific coffee maker...when it works. We are on our third and none has lasted longer than 2 years (the first one). The latest one we purchased has died at about the 13 month mark. Needless to say, we are done spending $90 on a coffee maker that dies as quickly as these models do. It is a great design from the cofee making and serving perspective, but in terms of reliability, this product is an absolute sham."
1,Class action suit,I have owned three of these units and everyone of them just stopped working within a year. The company knowes they have a problem with this unit and they continue to manufacture and sell them them. I will never buy any Cuisinart products again. Someone should go to jail for knowingly selling defective products to unsuspecting consumers.
2,Water Water Everywhere,"While this makes good coffee, it has Leaked From Day One. At first I thought I was just pouring in the water wrong. But, no. It leaks.I thought about returning it but it would be too much of a hassle to box it up, drive to UPS, wait in line, drive home, etc. My time is worth something. It is very stylish too I think. If you don't mind the water everywhere."
2,Replaced twice in two years,"I loved this coffee maker when I first got it. I mean, the brewed coffee never burned and it stayed hot for hours even after I turned off the machine. However, the electronics have gone out on three of these in the past two years. The company did sent replacements but come on...three machines in two years. My third one just went out yesterday and I'm not getting another one. I've had it. I'm switching brands."
2,"Was the best ever, until it died!","Love, love, loved it until it died. Couldn't find my receipt and likely close to 3 years, so no dice on the return, even though it was a known issue. Interestingly, this unit has been out for ages, and you would think they would fix this flaw! Anyway, a coffee maker should last considerably more than three years, so as much as I liked my fresh Cuisinart coffee, I am not getting ""burned"" again and will go with another manufacturer. I will also reconsider when looking at other Cuisinart products in the future...."
5,cuisinart coffeemaker,I am extremely pleased with the features and ease of use of this coffeemaker.would purchase it again if needed.
1,Poor design,"This coffee maker looks great, but it's not practical. The resevoir opening for the water is so small! You will get water everywhere! If you are left handed, then you're even worse off...Nice to look at, not so nice for everyday use..especially in the morning!"
2,Big time problems but I love the unit,We are on our 3rd unit in 2 years. Two of the units had electronic problems and 1 leaked all over the place. I love the idea but they MUST get better quality control. To Conair's credit they have replaced all 3 units. The first 2 cost $10 each plus the return postage and the last one they sent it free of charge but I still had to pay for postage $12.
2,"Be warned, very poor warranty","Great product, bad warranty. Cuisinart seems to feel it is OK for the customer to pay for shipping BOTH ways on any warranty repair. Get ready to spend $25+ if this thing breaks."
2,I Usually love Cuisnart Products but.... I am disappionted,"In spite of the warning in some of the reviews, I bought this product because I am very happy with my other Cuisinart products and I loved the design. Well, much to my disappointment, the reviews were correct. The coffeemaker leaks when you fill it regardless of how careful you pour (even with a funnel) and the spout drip leaks constantly, which makes a mess in the morning you do not need. It is a beautiful design but Cuisinart needs to fix the design functionality. This product's quality is not in the same category as their other coffeemakers."
2,Cuisinart DCC-2000 On Demand,"When it works, I have found this product to be a very good unit. However, my SECOND DCC-2000 just failed. I had assumed (yes, I know, key mistake) that the first was a fluke. However a little research on this site turned up information on a basic design flaw with the unit. It appears that condensation that gathers on the lid of the unit can run down to the electronic control circuitry and cause a short that eventually causes the unit to fail. Both of my coffee makers failed after about 8-12 months. The unit is too expensive to be a throw away item after a year of service. When working, this is an excellent maker. The coffee is very hot, and stays hot for over 2 hours without burning. It has a large capacity tank, and makes a good tasting cup of coffee..... when it actually works."
1,Cleaning issue,"After one year, we noticed black flakes coming out of the internal resevoir where the coffee is kept. We cleaned and soaked the coffee resevoir in vinegar, soap, hot water, etc., numerous times, but it is impossible to clean the internal float mechanism where coffee oils and burnt coffee collect. In the trash."
3,Nice looking coffeemaker,I bought this product couple weeks ago because it look nice and functional. After compare with my old generic coffeemaker. This brewer makes coffee with burning taste can not bring out the perfume of the coffee bean.
1,Beautiful machine... while it works,"Mine last a year and a half. Now is completely dead. Since I'm out of the States and without a warranty the unit is now a piece of nice silver junk. I have read in other forums that this model is buggy. Will not buy anything from Cuisinart again, ever. Don't buy this product. Stay away."
4,Good taste,"Very good testing coffee, easy to use and control your coffee. I drink small cups and my husband take larger cups, works good with this machine. Cleaning is not difficult. Only drawback is that this machines lifespan is no longer then manifucturers warranty.If you lucky it will die couple of months before warranty ends and Cuisinart will replace it, they are pretty good when it comes to it. This is what happend to my first machine. The replacement worked about 2 years and survived move across the country in the car ( have to have my coffee at all times)."
1,Worked fine for about one year...,This was a fine coffee maker for just under one year then it completely stopped working. Went back to the good old trusty Mr. Coffee. Seems like it should last longer for $100.00.
3,DCC-2000,"I am on my second DCC-2000. We loved the coffee maker but have not had good luck with it. The first one stopped heating before it was a year old. We called Cuisinart and they replaced the coffee maker which was great. We have had the second one for less than a year and it will not even turn on. I called customer service and was told to clean the coffee maker. I normally only clean the coffee maker once every couple of weeks, so I cleaned it again hoping that would work. It still didn't work. After turning it off and on and unplugging it for a couple of days, I called customer service again. This time I got a great rep, actually very nice and she said Cuisinart would replace the coffee maker, but since it had been replaced before Cuisinart could not replace again. Now I am using my daughters 4 cup pot from college and searching for a different coffee maker. Don't think I am going to get another DCC-2000. I will give Cuisinart customer service 4 stars!"
2,"Coffee not hot enough, critical flaw","Coffee does not dispense hot enough even with the 1-4 cup button depressed which states in the manual that this ""double heats"" the water to make the coffee piping hot. This button does not fix the problem. Unless you drink your coffee black, you need to to take your fresh brewed coffee and put it in the microwave. If you add milk, it is just luke warm. Also, even slightly tall mugs do not fit under the dispenser. Looks great otherwise but I didnt buy it to be a kitchen ornament."
2,disappointed,Only keeps coffee HOT for about 2 hours. Grinds overflow when making about 9 cups of coffee
3,thinking about buying it,"I really can't tell by the pics, but will a coffee pot fit under it to fill in the event you want to serve coffee to guest?forget the stars, amazon makes you rate it, before you can post."
1,Quality issues,"This thing is a piece of junk.When it works, it's great. But ours started leaking recently... as others have said, for a machine at this price range, one would expect longer life and better quality.Stay away from the product, it's junk!Customer service was horrible as well...."
4,LOVE IT...but.....,I fell in love with this coffee maker and I've had it for over a year now. BUT....I'm concerned that the hot acidic coffee in a plastic craft could cause some health problems (leaching of plastic into my coffee)? Does anyone know if the plastic craft is BPA-free? I have tried to get a hold of the company but no one was available to take my call. I'm going to buy a new coffee maker with a stainless steel craft and get rid of this item.
1,Purchased 2,1st one started leaking from fresh water tank aftor 8 months.2nd one started leaking aftor about 9 months.They do make good coffee so i convinced myself the first pot was just a dud.Not So.
4,"The vt 2656 is a wonderful bargain,The phones work beautifully.","This phone system works very well for me...I have used the vtech for 3 months with no major problems...I had to replace a defective battery,in one of my 3 phones...The main system has a very good 3 mailbox system...All handsets have built in speakerphones...The main system is also sold seperately,and extra handsets,up to four total can be purchased individually...I highly recommend this phone system 4 star rated."
1,0 Stars if I Could...,"As many of the other reviewers have already stated, this is a terrible book by a writer we have come to expect much more from. As I read through this novel, I felt myself hoping that I would hurry up and finish it, it was so awful. The story of Tristao and Isabel is unconvincing and comes across as a poor attempt to write a novel that many others have already done, much more successfully. The attempt to venture into magical realism is a complete and utter failure. The only strength of the novel lies with the depictions of poverty in Rio and at the mining camp the two lovers escape to. I dislike this novel so much that I wonder if I can write anything coherent about it. Suffice it to say that you should pass on this book and hope that Updike never attempts something like this again."
2,Meh,"I'll start by saying something positive. This book is beautifully written. The language in the prose is very vivid and poetic. However, what this book is really lacking in is the storytelling, the drama. Nothing that I've read in this book has been moving at all to the point where it pierced me inside. The narrative was predictible and never created any kind of a progression of moods. There were random and often times irrelevent descriptions of things like love making and scenery that were overly verbose and indulgent at the expense of the narrative. When a chapter is named ""The Nugget"" after about ten pages establishing that Tristao and Isabela have moved to a mining area to look for gold and are enduring fruitless hardships, it kind of destroys the suspense. This is a prime example of the widely known saying ""less is more."""
2,Don't use if you have dental fillings!,"Okay, this is NOT a product for people with sensitive teeth and fillings! Oh, my teeth were killing me after I used this and they still are! They have not ""calmed down."" All of my nerves are ""on fire."" I have NO idea how to get this back to Canada but I am awaiting the return info. DO not use this with dental equipment or filings!!! Yeow! Otherwise, maybe it works."
3,not sure if it works yet,The product works well to stimulate the muscles of the face and neck. I haven't had it long enough to determine if this will tighten those muscles and help to reverse the ageing process.
1,DON'T TRY THIS AT HOME!...,You have GOT to be kidding me! As a Board-Certified physician liscensed in five states I HIGHLY discourage what amounts to a 21-day fast; if you are strong enough to withstand 7 days without any water (most human beings are NOT; six days is usually fatal) the subsequent fast is highly likely to finish the job. I strongly discourage anyone from adopting such suicidal behavior.

2,"Breatharianism: for occultists only, if at all possible","Going without food is much like going without breathing, eventualy you will die unless your something special. I read this book and Jasmuheen says that this is not for people who don't do energy work ""If you have to ask then you can't do it"" she says. Now the book did get me to fast longer then I usually would have, say fifteen days or so beleiving I didn't really need food so there were some benefits. My psychic sensor was thrown out of wack because the beleif that we need food was discarded, a crucial jinga peice if you know anything of magic. I had very interesting visions and lucid dreams as well so it wasn't a total waste, her book did help me. That said, fasting is simply a technique for conserving vital energy and cleaning the entire body, 21 day water fasts are best. An interesting read and I like the auther but think she may be a little dilusional."
1,A dangerous myth,"A few people, all women, have followed the advice in this book literally -- and died from severe malnutrition. Living on light -- pull the other one! Really, this tripe is meant only for airheads."

5,This album defines 'classic' early '80's new-wave!,"I'll never forget getting into the Peppermint lounge (The hottest NYC club, at the time)in '83 and hearing the DJ spin ""New American"". It still remains one of the coolest, most ball's out, underground song of the era! It simply defines '80's cool!"
5,"As is most of Frank's recordings, this is great","It amazes me that recordings from this era are so much better than most new recordings. The engineers need to leave things alone and stop playing with all the buttons. Great recording, great listening. Worth it."
4,Interesting film but not the opera,"This happens to be one of my favorite operas--I have 9 DVDs of it--and this is an interesting adaptation in a very good restoration. But as one early critic said, in this version the opera has really been turned into a play with a few songs. Felsenstein has made a lively innovative film for its time (1970) but the opera itself is all but lost in the process (there is lots of added spoken dialogue). One-third to a half of the gorgeous music (in the latest longer restored versions of the score) is missing. The better dubbed film version is by Powell and Pressburger (1951, now in a superb Criterion Collection edition) but lovers of the music will need one of the filmed theatrical performances--and I personally would recommend the new, wildly untraditional Olivier Py sex-driven performance from Geneva (2008), although newcomers might want to start with something more down to earth like Domingo at Covent Garden (1981)."
2,kitchen appliance,This product was sent on time. I sent it back because it was not what I expected at all. Seemed most difficult to use for my needs.
1,worst vietnam book,"I will just say that this is by far the worst book on vietnam which I have personally read. It isn't so much the content, although it does come across that the author was possibly over the top as far as being arrogant, but the poor writing style. He attempts to lead us through the history of the Bravo Company often times via long portions of quoted conversations which attempt to give the blow by blow of what is happening, but instead end up being long boring narratives which left me somewhat lost. Cut to the chase and let me know what actually happened. I would say this is a valid attempt to write a book on a exciting topic that just simply failed because the person writing it isn't an author himself."
5,Unflinching account of infantry unit's experience in Vietnam,"In""Platoon: Bravo Company"", Mr. Hemphill's account of the 3rd Battalion, 22nd Infantry Regiment, Bravo Company's Vietnam war experience, while under his command as Captain is unflinching, candid, and necessarily detailed. The author takes the reader with him from the very first day that he takes the helm of Bravo Company for the duration of his command. The author carefully pays attention to battle site, historical, and factual detail, and weaves sufficient prose to pique the readers interest by describing the surrounding elements of experience, characters and survival. This book is recommended for the military enthusiast or avid reader who appreciates excellent non-fiction."
4,"Some great, some good, some ok","I bought this cd just for the Never, Ever and Forever song and because I saw all these great country artists on the soundtrack. I have to agree the recording quality is not as good as you'd expect. The songs are pretty good, some better than others...but I'm a country fan so I love most of them.I wouldn't pay $15.00 for the cd, but most are selling at $4 or so, which is worth it."
5,Mister Ed: Season One,I purchased this DVD for my son. He loves it. He is 50 years old and loves the old movies. The DVD came very quickly even though it was near Christmas. And best of all there was no shipping charge!
5,Forgot how good Mr. Ed was!,"Obviously my kids have never seen Mr. Ed and had never heard of it, so I bought the very first episode. To my surprise all of them watched the whole show, even my teenager and they wanted to see more. It's a good funny old show that a family can enjoy. I'll probably be buying more episodes..."
3,Author takes a risk,"*** maybe a spoiler ***(I composed most of this review when I was only 1/3 through the book so I don't believe it reveals anything, but you could reasonably disagree.)The entire book is a long, elaborate setup to a joke with the punchline at the end. This is a clever idea, and an unusual one. It's also risky - If you like the joke, the book is brilliant. If you don't, it's a waste of time. With good directing and intricate slapstick timing this could be an amazing movie, but it doesn't work so well as a book."
1,Horrible,"The worst Star Trek novel of all time. Avoid at all costs. Sometimes, Star Trek franchise Quality Control breaks down, and we end up with junk such as this. Pink yoghurt coming from the air vents? Don't waste your time."
5,Chaos is every where,"Actually the books is an outcome of scientific experiments in a computer lab. Differently from other reviewers, I want to notice that the facts of chaos exist in every where such as in Nature or in A Company.Writer shows that everything in the world can be reduced to a series of chemical reactions. Chemical reactions can generate a complex system such as life from dead. He argues also the equilibrium of life and dead from the view of the number of kinds of molecules and the number of kinds of outcome from these molecules create or which are already in the system.He also like many chaos theorist says that small changes in the system make big changes in the whole. (Explaining evalution). By some evidents and using probability, he shows that life on earth is the expected.The books most important view is explaning everything as chemical reactions. And I believe this is the right thing...At Home in the Universe: The Search for the Laws of Self-Organization and Complexity"
4,Hmmmm...,"Not exactly what I was expecting, but a worthwhile read. Did it live up the hype generated by the shouts below? Yup - in a way. If Kauffman is right, materialists have a lot to answer for. So do the creationists. Maybe there's meaning to it all after all. Hmmmm."
4,FM pop that doesnt disappoint,"This is the only Steely Dan album I have, and Im not sure Id enjoy any other as much. 'Reelin In the Years', 'Do it Again' and 'Midnight Cruiser' are all songs on the album that have listening value for me."
5,This is the ultimate hiking book for southern California.,"Jerry Schad knew what he was doing when he wrote this book. He introduces a number of trails that are both well known and some trails that are more hidden. He answers every question you can possibly have about each trail. They are rated and described in detail so any hiker of any level can find the ""right"" hike. The next best thing to actually hiking the trail is to read about it. His beautiful descriptive review of each trail is capturing and his careful attention to details of each hike is a definite plus. He didn't miss a thing in this book. Read it! It's definitely worth buying!"
5,Billo's en Navidad,"This is perhaps the best Christmas music from the Caribbean basin in my opinion. My parents always listened to this music and danced it during Christmas and end of the year festivities in Cartagena, Colombia during the sixties and seventies. I believe that Billo's en Navidad not only belongs to past generations but also new and coming generations, and therefore it is a classic in the Latin American music.Gustavo Benedetti Cincinnati, Oh"
3,a wedding gift,We chose this product as a wedding gift basedon the reputation and reliability of the company name. We have many cuisinart products in our home and we are happy with ev ery one of them. I expect this product to perform as well.
1,cold cream soup!,I agree with the rest of the 1 star reviews. The machine will run for the designated time (sometimes 30 minutes +) and at the end you just have very cold sweet creamy soup! DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!
4,Very good worship music,"At first, I was not as pleased with this WOW Worship as the original, mainly because I did not know alot of the songs... but many of them have become my favorite. I would recommend this to anyone who drives alot and needs some praise time with God. The music is great in that it is so varied... If you have the other WOW Worship and this... you have over 60 worship songs .... Put it on Random and be surprised on what song comes next.... We listen to this on Sunday mornings before going to church.... I recommend this!"
2,Not For Me,I watched the Dr. Oz show and he said to take this product and you would lose belly fat. I tried this product and did not like it as a weight loss product.
1,Needs lots of work,"About the only useful thing with the software is that it will generate a moderately useful cheat sheet list of positions based on a fairly flexible scoring system. But beware of all of the following:- The up to date stats are not truly up to date. I still have an RB who is out for the season showing up as #25 on the RB list- There is no information on defenses / special teams whatsoever- The cheat sheets only show rank, name, and team name. No other information is available such as score used to create the ranking and there is no ability to customize the cheat sheets once created- The functionality is programed very basically with many usability problems including the ability to even maximize the window beyond 800x600 to show all of the information at once without having to scroll the window- The draft tool cannot be saved mid-draft"
1,4 month lifespan,"I received the Cuisinart SPB-6 blender for Christmas. It broke four months later under normal use. The three year warranty means that I need to send the blender in and pay for all shipping and handling. Cuisinart insists that I include the glass jar when I ship for ""diagnostic purposes"" which means shipping will cost about the same price as a new blender. Sneaky sneaky."
1,It broke the first time I used it.,"I use blenders to make smoothie/shakes with ice every morning. Some work better than others, but this was the worst. It broke down immediately, on its first encounter with the ice. A complete waste."
5,War at their best,"This album was a social statement when making one wasn't the best idea. The title track is haunting. ""Cisco Kid"" and ""Beetles In The Bog"" are hypnotic and will get your attention real quick. This is the first album that you should pick up by this band. You will want more after you hear it."
5,Great!!,"If you are looking for the full version of City Country City and Four Corner Room, this is a must for you.."
4,A good read,"Dr. Amen book is full of great facts, and this one was wrote with very few references to join his web site. I would recommend this book if you are wanting to make a good brain great. You actually feel that he might care for the person and not the money."
3,very good looking but ehhh,"cool looking, but glass made awful glassy noises when cups were placed on it (i if you put something on glass it will make a noise) but it sounded as if it was going to crack. Were also missing some of the non-slippery little pegs on the bottom so I returned them."
3,OK Laptop but horrific support,"Just got the laptop in. Had to re-image the system. I'm not much for all the adds and junk. Good luck on getting drivers. I needed to move over to a 64 bit O/S and HP just can't get the ftp site operational. Basically that laptop is just a waste of power until I can get the drivers, so off hunting the internal component drivers from vendors. Last time I'll buy something like this from HP. Stick to printers and save the install disks."
2,Fraudulent Release,"The low score is for the nature of this ill-conceived and dishonest release, not the artist. Coltrane himself plays rather well here, but as the above reviewer also noted, he is far from the featured artist. Despite the cd title, there were never any Bethlehem ""years"" at all. Coltrane simply sat in as a backup horn during a few sessions in the late fall of 1957 for other recording artists. He takes solos, but only a few. This is simply a good example of how record companies repackage older and forgotten material in a manner more likely to be scooped up by completists. The music in here is ok, but it's not Coltrane, and it's not worth the money."
5,Hauntingly Beautiful Music,"Every once in a while a recording comes along that you are sure will stay with you for the rest of your life. This is one such recording. Georgeous melodies, incredible rhythm section, standout soloists like Hancock and Shorter, and above it all the voice of Milton Nascimento. I cannot recommemnd anything more highly than this - it should be required listening for anyone who enjoys and appreciates good music. There are tracks here which grab you AND DO NOT LET GO. An absolute classic in every sense of the word."
3,furry towels,"The boss lady wanted chocolate brown towels to match those supplied by our Decorator. The color matches within acceptable limits, but the odd thing about them is that even when washed they exude brown fuzz. I was picking brown lint off my face and clothing for hours. Other than that the towels seem fine and a bargain at the price. Just wash them a few times before using; especially if you have a two day beard."
5,"So much more than ""a skating novel""!","I read Dreams Of Gold on a friend's recommendation. I wasn't sure I wanted to--I love watcing Olympic-level figure skating, but could it sustain a worthwhile novel?I needn't have worried--Dreams is as much about culture conflicts--much of the story is set in Japan, and the scenes and people are rendered so skillfully that I feel as though I just returned from Japan--as it is about skating, though I certainly have a far better appreciation of what goes into producing a world class skater than I did.Dream is also, and ultimately, about love. If you've ever wondered whether you're making a mistake about someone you think you love--and who hasn't--you'll identify with feisty, competitive Maggie Campbell, Dreams' delightful heroine.A terrific read!"
3,Iron Cage,"The prologue and epilogue give a clue to the inspiration for the story. Unfortunately for my enjoyment of the book I cared a great deal more about the cat and her kittens than I did for the three stranded humans on some distant planet. The story of man marooned among intelligent animals has been done much better in other stories (Planet of the Apes for instance) that it took quite a bit of determination for me to finish the book. Things finally pick up at the half way point when some other humans arrive to ""rescue"" the three castways and thankfully the book does give a happy ending back on earth to the cat and her kittens."
2,Cute but defective,This puzzle is constantly making noises on it's own. I thought it was possessed or we had spirits communicating through the puzzle.I read the reviews after I bought the puzzle and it turns out this is happening to other people who have the puzzle. It also makes animals noises when you place the wrong piece over it so that teaches nothing. Sometimes it won't make the noises at all even if you touch the metal piece inside the picture.
4,90% Works,The horse puzzle piece doesn't work. The little metal disc is on the wrong side so the pieces don't line up...thus no sound. At least the puzzle pieces fit in correctly.
2,Has a number of flaws,"I received this mug as a gift and find it has a number of flaws. First, it doesn't keep the coffee hot as long as other mugs I have owned. Another problem, and most annoying, is that it does not provide ""nose"" space. When I take a sip, the tip of my nose gets squashed against the lid, and my nose is not at all large.As someone else mentioned, it has an interior lip around the upper edge and when you rinse it, water gets caught in there and dribbles back down when you set it upright, so there is always a puddle at the bottom. The only way to get it out is with a towel. The mug is narrow and it's hard to get your hand down in there. I am a woman and my hands are average size.The lid is hard to position, too. I will say that this mug is leak proof, but my old Nissan leak proof was far superior."
3,Has one problem,"This cup is almost perfect. It doesn't keep liquids hot as long as I'd like but I can live with that. It's non-spill, which is great. The big problem is that when immersed in water for cleaning, water leaks into the bottom and under the rubber base. This causes water leakage. Big drag!"
3,Contigo: Good but not Great....decent?,"I have to agree for the most part with a previous reviewer, it's a nice mug, doesn't spill, snaps and closes tight. I never let my coffee sit for hours however, so I don't know if it would stay hot longer than 30 min.? I doubt it would. Gripes: the rubber bottom of mine came off so the construction may be questionable although it was really, really snug in my car holder; the lid sometimes sticks and is almost impossible to pry off (but a tight lid is better than spilling coffee on yourself). All in all if you can find one cheap, like I did at Costco, I'd recommend it. The Starbucks labeled mugs are made by Contigo as well and cost about $30. One tip, don't wash them in the dishwater like I did, the hot water melted off the glue so the side grips are loose and flop around the mug. I own a Starbucks version (gift) and two others from Costco (set of two)."
4,Mugged,This is a great mug. The lid is difficult to twist on and twist off - the tight fit is not all bad. The rim of the mug holds liquid when the lid is removed and the mug is inverted. After washing the mug - you turn the mug over and place it in the dish drainer. In this position the rim of the mug holds liquid and when you right the mug the liquid runs into the mug. Great mug.
2,Quite dull,"The prose is dry, and the book didn't provide any insights you couldn't get from just asking someone on the street -- no new material, no interesting conclusions."
3,Review,I thought the book was good but not what I expected in the best things in life. It makes me feel like I have more questions than answers. Maybe that's what the purpose of this book is.
3,Mostly focused on academia,"This book primarily focuses on classroom cross-cultural learning and pre-study or pre-work abroad preparation. While many of the exercises are good, the ""experiential"" approaches primarily involve having different role plays and conversations and then flipcharting people's responses."
2,Not Worth the Money,"There is a lot of mis-information in this book. I am a Hedgehog owner and I disagree with many of the handling tips - such as ""always wear gloves"" - that Mr. Kelsey-Wood recommends. An interesting note: all of the photos show hedgies being held without gloves. This book has a lot of glossy pictures that are not related to the text on the page. This confuses the reader who may be looking for an illustration of the text being read. It is not a very well organized book and should not be used by a novice Hedgehog owner."
1,"Good pictures, bad info","This book is totally inappropriate for anyone looking for how to properly care for a hedgehog. Pictures shown have no relation to the text. For example, a picture with a person holding a hedgehog with bare hands has a caption that says to always hold hedgehogs with a glove- which isn't a very good idea. It obviously wasn't edited very well- some parts are very redundant. Mr. Kelsey-wood obviously didn't put very much time into content- more effort went into photographs. The photographs, however, are great. If you want a book of hedgehog pictures, this is a good one. If you want a book with content on how to take care of hedgehogs, you should buy another book."
2,Oops!,"This is an awful recording. It's to bad with wonderful tenors like Caruso, Carreras, Pavarotti and Domingo. Also there are many mistakes on the cd. Such as the arias are in the wrong order. Plus some are not from the operas that are listed. And the order of singers is out of order. It's Caruso, Carreras, Pavarotti, Domingo instead of Caruso, Pavarotti, Domingo, Carreras. So it is a real big disapointment."
5,What most men need to know,"This book is just full of good information you need to know but aren't taught anywhere. I'm a man and I know that I look and feel more confident when I look as good as I can. This book tells you how to do that and it's practical too...not flashy - just classy. It's nice to know that my favorite shirts are broadcloth material - I now look for them in the stores or online. That standard shoes should include loafers, boots and a pair of wing tips - none of which I had before - but I do now - and they look great. That you should pay attention to the watch you wear - because others do. That you should wash your face twice a day, that you should shave after the shower so the room is steamy...If you are wanting to change your image to one of a well groomed, well dressed man, reading this book is a great start."
5,AWESOME!,IT WAS NICE GETTING IT AT A REASONABLE PRICE...I AM A HUGE FAN OF AIM AND THIS WAS ONE OF THE FEW CDS I NEEDED FOR MY COLLECTION OF HERS...I HOPE SHE CONTINUES TO MAKE MUSIC AND I HOPE HER FANS CONTINUE TO SUPPORT HER AND RECOMMEND HER TO ALL THEIR FRIENDS...LOVE YA AiM
4,"When Steely Dan was a Group, not a Project","Although a commercial failure as the follow up to ""Can't Buy a Thrill"", ""Countdown to Ecstacy"" is, to me, the only album where Steely Dan was more than a project for Walter Becker and Donald Fagan. Later albums would produce bigger hits and sell better as Becker and Fagan brought in the best studio musicians of the day, but those albums lack a cohesive theme and feel disjointed when viewed as a whole.""Countdown"" is a great album because it represents 5 guys working together as a unit to produce great music."
4,Steely's Second Set,"Countdown To Ecstasy brought out more of Steely Dan's jazz leanings than their debut. Songs like ""Razor Boy"", ""The Boston Rag"" and ""Showbiz Kids"" have a jazzy flair. ""Bodhisattva"" has a hypnotic beat and refrain and ""King Of The World"" has a fluid and laconic mood. ""My Old School"" is the centerpiece of the album with it's vivid and sinister lyrics, Donald Fagen's rolling piano fills and blazing horns, it is a Steely Dan mastercut."
5,Time Tested,"Nothing to complain about here. Pretty much every song is good, though the early Steely Dan is more rock-oriented than the later jazz-pop version."
4,Too much of a good thing,"Okay, each track is expertly executed and perfectly satisfying to the listener.But there's no listening to this CD straight through. It's just too much trumpet for one hour's sitting. Strange concept for a CD. Best to consider it a sampler."
2,You should audition it first,"Although this recording is superb, I purchased it for one song (Chaconne en rondeau, for viola da gambe & continuo in G major (Pièces de viole, Book II, No. 82)) that I had heard on an online radio source. This particular selection is definitely not characteristic of Marais's works. However, it is interesting to note the amazing similarity to Enya's piece that gives no credit to Marais."
3,Few Answers to Problems!,"It would be nice if the author gave more than a smattering of answers for the problems in the book. If your instructor doesn't give these out to you in class or you didn't purchase the study guide, you are just screwed.Edit:*Note: Please see review on study guide. It's not worth the money. You're better off studying the CD that came with the book. Which in all fairness, while not a work of art, does help drive home the concepts."
3,Wow,"This book was a must for class, however, the professor read from the 11th edition and ended up having to order the electronic 11th version off another site for a cheaper price then on Amazon. I did find the CD very helpful in trying to comprehend the lessons. I'm glad this class is over and I'll take a C over a D anyday. I did love the price of the book and will keep it in my arsenal of law books."
3,Missing Chapters,The book has everything it says other than a few key chapters in the lesson i'm taking. So I lost money having to buy another book.
5,"Back and, just maybe, better than ever","Iceland's Sigur Ros return with ""Takk..."" and what a return it is. Epic, beautiful, anthemic...this album, like most of Sigur Ros' output, is all of those things, but ""Takk..."" adds two elements that have not always been present in their music (and something that was greatly missing on 2002's ( ), their last release); hope and immediacy. Ripping out of the gate with the heavenly 'Takk' and 'Glosoli', ""Takk..."" grabs your hand and takes you on a journey you need to go on.This is easily Sigur Ros' most accessible record but the faithful will be pleased to hear that that accessibility has not been gained with the forfeit of any of the band's creativity or care for their craft. Elements still snake in and out of songs perfectly and everything seems to have been touched by a higher power. If there's one thing that ""Takk..."" does, it's make you feel. Lullabys and car-crashes, it's all here.Simply put, ""Takk..."" is stunning. This is music."
1,Simply boring,"I listened to this record and to Sigur performing live, playing these new tracks. Boring. Their first albums were great and almost brought you to tears. But now, I am just bored."
1,SAVE YOUR MONEY,"i don't know what wrong with all you people who think this album is worth buying. this is the most boring record i ever heard, there's nothing interesting in this experimental sounds. i think that even this guys from sigur ros were so blody boring while recording this...i wish i can take my money back..."
1,Takk it away from me,"When I tried to load this CD into the player, it repeatedly rejected it, and when it finally deigned to play it, appeared to be trying to vomit it out. Hardly surprising, given that this dreary pap is one of the most overrated CDs I have heard in some time. There is really nothing to admire in this painful Enja crossed with a wrench rendition. Avoid at all costs!"
5,Sigur Ros does it again,"I started listening to this band after following a ""related artists"" link frm bjork and came across a bounty. This band pushes a listener to invest and in turn return with emotion and life. ""()"" SR's previous album in my opinion is slightly better than Takk.. but the uplifting nature and more drumming in this album definetly makes it easier to listen to. 4.5 star for Takk, 5.0 stars for ()Buy this... wait for a gloomy afternoon, make some tea and become moved..."
5,Their best album,"If you haven't heard them before Sigur Rós may seem a bit weird with the high breaking vocals and ambient effects mixed into the pulsing rhythmic backbone that constitutes the majority of their music. I found this album more accessible than most of their others though, and would recommend it for those looking to give Sigur Rós a try. It's also my favorite album of theirs.I found almost the entire album enjoyable, and I can't say enough about the two standout tracks, Glósóli and Sglópur. Glósóli is a lesson on how to form a build, Sglópur's piano part catches you from the start and really carries the song well, and both of them have an uncanny ability to make you feel as if you could just lift off the ground and soar into the sky. If that's the kind of music you're looking for I doubt this album will disappoint."
4,Good experience,"But by no means their best album, it is their most accesible yet, but i prefer the previous, Agaetis Byrjun. Don't get me wrong this is a great album, full of allucinating moments according to your emotional state. Every sigur rós album is a different, enjoyable expierence. I of course recommend this one."
2,If Coldplay made a Sigur Ros album,"( ) is one of my favorite albums. Agaetis Byrjun is amazing too.Takk, however, is not amazing. This is by far the biggest dissappointment of 2005 to me. I've listened to this album at least a dozen times now, hoping that *maybe* it would somehow grow on me -- afterall, I didn't exactly love ( ) the first time I heard it either. I even got the privelage of seeing them live -- great by the way -- which I hoped would make me like these songs better... but it didn't. There's something critical that's missing from Takk that made Agaetis Byrjun and ( ) so good: emotion. The opening of Flugufrelsarinn, the climax of Ny Batteri, the build-up in Untitled 8. These are the things that made Sigur Ros great. There are some good moments on Takk, like Glosoli, but for the most part it's just pretty noises. Takk sounds like Coldplay trying to make a Sigur Ros album.If you're looking for an intro to the band, don't start here, pick up Agaetis Byrjun or ( )."
4,Decent.,"Nothing ground breaking in my opinion, considering Sigur Ros always have been this way, but I am very pleased to see them back."
1,Very disappointing!,"Honestly this book is a steer clear. Sure it has some examples that are usefull but the explanation of the code is horrible. For someone like myself who has experience in Java, C++, PHP, VB.NET, HTML and more i found this book very difficult to follow and understand.I have since got FlashMX game design Demystified by Jobe Makar and would have to say 5 stars for that book. That explains everything properly and even teaches you the basics in mathematics and physics which was a good brush up for myself. I also like his use of OO programming so that code is resuable and he also goes lightly into using xml for building objects such as levels."
3,VCR Problems,"I was originally after the DMR-EH75VS which is the same but with an 80 gig internal drive, but is running around $400. The reviews are great too. I decided to go with this version since it was cheaper, despite the reviews that the VCR was eating tapes fresh out of the box. I bought it from BJ's for $250 (was higher on Amazon at the time, although it is now $200). Wouldn't you know, the first time I put a tape in to copy it to DVD (which works great by the way) the tape got stuck and I got the F06 error. I took it back today and am going to order the original one I wanted. Seems they worked to kinks out of that upper model since the reviews are pretty good.If you manage to get one of these without having problems with it eating tapes, it is a really nice machine. The recording to DVD seems easy enough and the HD quality upconversion was noticeable from my cheap little APEX dvd player to my new HD Plasma."
2,Totally frustrating,"If you want to use this to record or play VHS tapes, DON'T!! Read all the other reviews about the problems people have when tapes get jammed. Panasonic should be ashamed."
1,Buy This Somewhere Else,They gave me this DVD Recorder after it was returned by the previous customer. The previous customer's invoice was still inside and the unit had scratches and was repacked poorly. I returned it - the unit you get may be the one I returned.
4,Panasonic,"This is the second VCR-DVD recorder I purchased. It is a very good machine. It is a complex instrument to learn but it does everything well. My other VCR-DVD is an LG and its' VCR recording quality pales in comparison to the Panasonic.I would recommend it to anyone who wants the flexibility of recording temporary files on the VCR and more permanent files on the DVD and has a HDTV with HDMI input. With a commercial DVD, the picture quality is very good using the HDMI input and much better than the standard RF input."
2,"Good for text, bad for graphics","I bought this little laserjet to print transparencies but the output quality of the graphics is very poor even with the resolution set to 600x1200 dpi. For text it is very good, fast, easy to set up and reliable. No USB cable included which seems to be the standard now. Would I recommend it? well if you want a cheap laserjet just to print out text document then go for it but if you want decent graphics and halftones then you will have to flex the credit card a bit and spend quite a bit more. I've given my Minolta to the kids and bought a much better laserjet."
5,Madagascar,"This was a particularly good game for our younger kids, though our 9 year old was able to finish the entire game in a weekend. Our 7 year old continues to enjoy it without the same degree of frustration that he experiences with some other games that are a bit too old for him. This game was great even though the kids have not seen the movie."
5,other reviews,"Here are 2 reviews of my book:""Women's studies, lesbian studies, and large reference collections will want to purchase this title.""-ARBA (A librarian reference book review online site)""An excellent reference work...The field of Lesbian Studies is new and growing. It needs books like the Historical Dictionary of the Lesbian Liberation Movement as guides to its activist beginnings and continuation.""-FEMINIST COLLECTIONSPlease note: I tried to enter this without rating my own book--but I had to, so hence the 5 stars :) I plan to update the dictionary, so if you see omissions, or find info that should be included."
3,Trying again...,"This product JUST arrived, TEN DAYS LATE. I will be leaving more information as I decide whether or not this is a great product or not....stay tuned."
1,Rude Awakenings,"It appears to me that Herb Quakenbush was wrong when he stated to me ""The Haunting by Margaret Mahy is the Holy Grail of reading."" One couldn't be further from the reality, that it is disturbing to say the least. My Uncle Merengue, a title by Pierce Thurm is much better, so much better I would stake my dog Merk's life on it. If you are gonna pick up a book, pick up My Uncle Merengue, you won't be disappointed. Boo, Ghost Cave, BOO! crayons."
3,Interesting read,"I found this book in the library, and the title intrigued me so I picked up and read the first few pages--got pretty hooked and so took it home.The story idea is wonderful: an archeologist goes on a quest to find the Urim and Thummim from the Old Testament. I loved the story idea, but found myself skimming through sections that were very long. I found it interesting to think of how God would talk to someone in our day."
5,"""PROMISE ME"" You'll pick this one up......","One of the incredible divas of freestyle music...Lil' Suzy never disappoints. 7 tracks on this multi-max single; well worth the money. Extended mix, accapella, radio, old school, etc. I knew I loved this song the first time I heard it. A true classic. Lil' Suzy will always be my freestyle princess."
4,Good Book at the Right Price,"I enjoyed this book, mainly because of Larry McMurtry's talent for drawing characters. I've found myself upset and mad and things people did in the book, and I've had to remind myself that it's a book. (That's a hallmark of a good book to me!).I bought this book for $5.00 in a used book store. That's how I purchase any book with a Kindle price over $9.99. I would have paid $9.99 on the Kindle, but nothing over that. Sorry, Amazon. Until you start flexing your considerable muscle with the publishers, that's how I'm going to buy my books."
5,Feel Good movie,"If you are looking for a feel good movie about love, food and friendship, then search no further. A great movie to watch alone or with a friend. It will make you laugh and cry and if you are a Julia Roberts fan, bonus!"
1,Pray You Never Have To Watch This - For Pretentious Nitwits Only,"This is a classic ""Men Bad, Women Good"" movie that ultimately contradicts itself. Its a long, long, long boring movie about very little at all. The movie is like a very ornate and expensive vase filled with Spam - you rudh to look inside and then the reaction: ""Yuck, that's awful"".The truth is, I'm not a big Julia Roberts fan. Heck I'd rather watch an Eric Roberts film (even Sharktopus is better than this) than sit through this again. The film's lame premise is a woman's voyage of discovery through different cultures that results in a revelation after she gets nailed by some Brazillian guy. I guess its true; that if you do it right, sex can be an epiphany generating experience...Do yourself a favor - don't go near this dreck."
1,Save your Money,"Adult whining to the inth degree. I was soooooooooo disappointed with Julia Roberts for taking this one into her repertoire. She's too good for drivel like this. I can honestly say this is the first time in my life that I got drowsy during a movie and even considered leaving. It was toooooo long, too shallow for something that pruportedly had adults looking for real purpose, and too full of people committing without ever committing. Richard from Texas was the only redeeming part, and he wasn't all that. I regret having spent the money and the time."
4,Good movie,"I like the general idea of the movie, but it would've been better if it had been with some unknown actress instead of a well-known one. In any case, if you're looking for a movie about self-discovery I have yet to find a better one despite this."
4,spoke to me!,It's a great movie if you are into personal growth and overcoming fears and obstacles in your path. It's about making choices and being open! It also has some great scenes.
3,Good movie,"A good story, but a bit long. We broke it up into two evenings, which worked well. If only we could all take a year to travel and ""find ourselves"" !"
3,Arrived Quickly,"Hello,I bought this a Christmas Gift and it arrived quickly. Thank you for that as one of my other gifts from another person did not! I have not heard any complaints from the person it was given to. The movie was delivered with no scratches or markings on the box. I will let you know if anyting else happens noteworthy. Thank you for the speedy delivery!"
1,Boring and a waste of time!!!!!!,"This has to be the most boring movie I have ever seen. Well, I didn't actually see the whole thing, I stopped it about half way through as I couldn't stand to sit and waste anymore time watching it. I think I would rather go to the dentist than to sit and watch this movie."
1,WTF!,THIS MOVIE IS FOR ALL THOSE NORTHAMERICAN WOMEN IN THEIR MIDDLE AGE CRISIS!! GOT DIVORCE AND FIND THE NEXT GUY.SOUNDS NEW? NOPE...
3,I should've rented it - not bought it,"OK I like the movie, the plot, the actors, and mostly the settings. However, it became a little dull when I watched it for the second time. But then again, to each his own."
1,badly done,"Okay, I didn't read the book, but whatever magically transformative life journey this Liz character truly experienced certainly does not come across in this film. Everything feels utterly staged, phony, and artificial. The acting is boring. The storyline is boring and the flow is painfully choppy (now we eat. now we pray. now we love). This directing is horrendous (did we really need all the closeups of Julia Roberts eating spaghetti? Okay, I get it. This is the ""eat"" part). I am glad to see I'm not alone for a change in bashing a bad film. Several scenes just made me wince at the insincere, artificial quality. The character does come off seeming a like a spoiled princess who thinks this weather-beaten old spirtitual advisor character can help transform her life. Sorry not buying it. Please please please! No more tedious, predictable, stale films like these. One star for James Franco for the eye candy value."
1,"Ate, prayed it got better, but didn't, hated it!","I love Julia Roberts, and so does my girlfriend and I remembered she wanted to see this movie when it was in the movies but we never got there so I got it for her for Christmas along with a Blu-ray player for our bedroom.BIG MISTAKE!....This movie is NOT one of Julia's best, it's her worst ever, it never gets off the ground, it's as flat as a pancake, if you are a Julia Roberts fan and MUST HAVE THIS MOVIE, then rent it and save your money, trust me, IT BLOWS, we turned it off with an hour to go, it was pure, unadulterated agony when we found out there was an hour left, the groan could be heard all over the house.It was so bad, I actually apologized to her for buying it for her for Christmas.Who knew?"
5,Daughter loves it!,My Daughter must have watched this movie a million times. Thought it would be worn out by now. I was wrong!
4,Wonderful,Love the movie. Trying to find balance. I needed this. The spiritual parts were very cool.I recommend it for sure.
1,Almost indescribably bad,"This movie is simply ghastly. Julia Roberts still looks good in jeans even at her age, and that's where anything positive about this movie ends. A film about selfishness, self-indulgence and nothing else. That might be all right if the movie had any entertainment value, but it is simply deadly dull. Boring. RJB."
3,It's okay,"I had to read this book to help me with a report. It doesn't talk much about S. E. Hinton's life, but it's great if you need it to help you write about her books. It explains each character in all her books alot. It also talks about her books' settings and themes. If you need to talk about that, it's very helpful."
3,Audio Recording Not Well Balanced,"I would describe many of the songs on this CD as ""muddy"" in that the vocals do not standing out enough from the background orchastration and the overall effect is one of lack of clarity. There are much better recordings of everyone on this CD. Buy the songs you like but skip the CD."
1,lame,"It wouldn't let me return it after I bought it, I hadnt even received it yet and wanted to get my money back but it wouldn't let me. I bought it as a gag gift but turns out someone else beat me to it and now I'm stuck with it. It's not a very good product and even if I wanted to use it I wouldn't, its not flexible and I thinly it would probably be uncomfortable to use. Definitely would not recomend."
3,ok toy for first toy,"this vibrator was ok i didnt really like it too much because it just felt too hard, yea it was jelly but still hard and it kinda hurt when inserted. also kinda short i felt that it needed to be longer i couldnt get a good grip on it. some good things about it were that it didnt have a nasty smell to it and easy to clean and good vibrations except well you put it at full speed its kinda loud."
3,It is a hair better than a bullet,"OK, this one is with shape and bumps that mimics the real thing. however, it is still NOT the real thing. As the vibration goes, it simply not enough. Not because of the strength but because of the human nature that repeatability kills the curiosity. The thrill feeling initially when inserted went away quickly. So for higher requirement on experience, all vibrators with fixed frequency will not work after a while. With its bumps, it does work better than a simple bullet, but may not even compare to an egg with much stronger move."
2,"Good story, bad editing","I gave this review a 2 because there are 3 blatant errors in the writing. I devour books like this in a day or two, and this one was no exception. I've never read a Diana Palmer book before, but I definitely had high hopes. Unfortunately, I have a pet peeve about spelling errors or grammatical mistakes in books. I understand that author's make mistakes, but that's what editors are for, right?The story of Trilby and Thorn was beautiful. They were in love, but both thought the other was still in love with someone else. The intertwining story of Sissy and her ""savage"" indian left me ready to find the book with that story.I may try out another Diana Palmer book - the writing was good, so maybe this was just a bad editing job."
4,Mocha-Rific,"Black women are strong and beautiful and live with the stress and drama of life everyday. Musings Of A Mocha Sista by Pam Osbey is a compilation of positive stories and poetry that make me proud to be a Black woman. One of my favorite poems is ""Sista Love,"" this poem details how instead of downing each other. As women we should lift each other and be there for one another.In the poem ""Rejoice"" Ms Osbey writes of letting God into your life and letting the glory of His Word rain down upon you. This poem is deeply spiritual and serves as a beacon of light in dark times. This poem is most definitely appropriate now as we as a country try to recover from recent terrorist attacks.Pam Osbey is a force to be reckoned with in the literary world and I am very much looking forward to reading more of her work. On the RAW scale Musings Of A Mocha Sista is a 4.Reviewed by Simone A. Hawks"
