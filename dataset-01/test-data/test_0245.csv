3,disappointed,"I purchased this product to clean the grout in my house and it made no difference. It is OK if you want it for light jobs like regular cleaning of hard surfaces. If you are looking for something to do heavy duty jobs like cleaning grout on floors, look elsewhere."
2,Immovable Cap,"The cleaner would work just fine if I could get the cap off. This is the second Shark EuroPro I've owned, and I had to trash the first one for the same reason. Fool me once ... Never again!"
4,Awesome product,"This is an amazing steamer. It's worth getting! I highly recommend it. These are the only glitches that I could tell so far . . . . Storage is a little difficult. It is not a retracting cord and the extra pieces (the ones that don't fit in the storage compartment) are large. (Not a major problem though.) Also, it does take about 8 or so minutes to heat up. Once you start cleaning, the steam only lasts for 10 minutes or so then you have to let it heat up again to continue steaming. One container did clean A LOT OF surface area, but I did have to let it re-heat 3 or 4 times in one cleaning. Still not enough of a drawback to not get it. The cleaning job it does is superior to anything else I have tried. Overall . . . THUMBS UP!!!"
4,Best Sanitizer,"Absolutely the best way to clean and sanitize almost everything in your personal environment without using chemicals. There are no miracles. You still have to wipe up the dirt and germs you blast loose from surfaces. But instead of being trapped in a room full of bleach or ammonia vapors you are sanitizing with steam, getting the room very clean and have healthy sinuses as a bonus. Many helpful attachments. Easy to use. Sturdy. I have a small on also, which comes in handy."
2,"Ok, I remember why I sold this cd","Gosh! I guess groups have to start somewhere. This is a somewhat half-decent album but subsequent albums showed what dc Talk was truly capable of. This album is not horrible enough to get a 1-star rating, but it isn't very good either.All the songs sound so similar, because Toby keeps on rapping the same way over and over again. And poor Kevin and Tait don't even get to do that much in this album. No wonder they started to ask for more input on the albums -- they barely have a role here except to be background vocalists.Props need to go to dc Talk for being one of Christian music's premiere rap groups, but this album is nothing to get excited over."
2,"I wouldn't reccomend it, But you will find 2 good tracks","The 1989 debut cd by DC Talk really doesn't sound anything like the DC Talk that we know about today. Tobymac, Tait, And K-max all made their first statement to the world as musicians on this pretty much forgettable album. Instead of the challenging and enduring power of their music that's found on their later releases, We instead get 8 tracks of mostly outdated and very cheesy 80s hip-hop. On this album, DC Talk sounds like a cross between Early MC Hammer, Run DMC, And Kool Moe Dee. If you must have this album, You will at least enjoy 2 tracks, Which are ''Spinnin Round'' [By far the greatest song on this album] and ''Final Days''. This is pretty much an embarrassment for DC Talk considering how far they've come in the albums that've followed this release, But hey, Everyone's got a past..."
1,"Please, what a joke!",You can't get worse than three people trying to rap and be hardcore that are real life kittens. Totally unbelievable and a complete musical disaster. F
5,Diana: The People's Princess,"Fantastic film! Highly recommended! Note: It was a made for tv movie and embellished some, on the actual events....however, based on all that I've read and watched in the media with regard to Diana's life the final year or so of her life, this is pretty accurate. The actors who portray Dodi and Diana look very much like Princess Diana and Dodi Al Fayed (both in physical characteristics and subtle mannerisms/facial expressions,stance, etc)If you are a major fan of Princess Diana, and would enjoy a sneak peak of how her life played out that final year from 1996 to 1997, it's definitely worth a viewing!!Enjoy."
2,"DVD set inconsistent, response from seller non-existent","My 4-season DVD set included 2 seasons that had no bonus features (even though the menu listed them, you could never navigate to it), and one disc that was clearly some Asian bootleg, with episodes that had been ripped right off network TV. I attempted twice to contact the seller (2/19 and 3/1) and received no response."
1,House Collection never received,"Ordered and paid for 4 volumes of ""House"" on April 26,2009.Today is May 28, 2009 and have not received product or heard back from seller.WOULD NOT RECCOMEND SELLER! Plan to cxl payment with American Express"
1,Disappointed,I had this watch three weeks and it stopped working. I sent it to a warranty repair facility and have heard nothing back yet. I am very surprised and disappointed that a new watch would malfunction after such a short period. I guess the quality of the watch brand is not as good as I thought it was.
5,"Simple, but nice.","I'll keep it short. This is an excelent watch for the price. The band is acctually really nice considering it's a textile band. Note that the photo shows it a bit more brown then it really is, its more a military green. The face is simple, yet elegant and is easy to read. Not as elaborate as my other citizen watch, but suiting considering the watches simple nature.The inside of the textile band seems to have some sort of poly-leather lining. Not entirely sure what it is or how it will hold up in the long run. Overall im very pleased."
4,"Great watch, band is odd","The watch is a wonderful quality citizen eco drive, at a very competitive price. The band, however, is backed with a strange sticky leather or pleather, and the holes are an odd metal rivet. Had to buy a new band as it was quite uncomfortable."
2,citizen eco-drive watch review,"The main problem with this watch...and it is/was a big problem...the canvas watch band was way too short in length. I am not a big person, not overweight, and don't have big wrists..but the band was about an inch too short. I kept the watch but had to buy another band to make it work. A last note, the watch looks black in the photos but the band is army green and the watch face has a green tint to it."
1,This product has not been sent.,"This product has not been sent. The product delivered is different from the purchased product. 3 sticks chunky charcoal were sent, different from the product shown in the image."
4,"Great watch, small band","Like others have mentioned, the band that comes with this watch is very short. So short that I physically could not use it, even on the very last hole. However, I replaced it with a longer hadley-roma waterproof leather band (black to match the face) and I love it. If the band were longer, it would get 5 stars. Since I had to replace the band, it only gets 4 stars.Also, I didn't buy this on Amazon, but rather on that certain auction site everyone knows about. Still bought it new, but saved $20 over the amazon price, which paid for the watchband I had to buy."
1,busted,dropped the watch from a sitting position and the face cracked and the whole insidde broke.. sent it in to citizen and they gave an estimate of fixing it for 150.00. more than i paid for the watch. don't buy citizen.
3,Not quite what I expected.,Oddly this watch for all of its dodads lacks a second hand and date readout. I returned it for the lower yet more suited for my needs version.
3,A bit overpriced,Watch looks nice. But it does not feel the same.The strap is a little small for chubby guys like me. I got to use it on the second hole and I not any big at all.Not many functions and very basic calendar. I think you should spend a few more dollars and buy made completely of stainless steel or even better Titanium.
5,Nice Addition.,"Just received my Citizen AT0200-05E today and the watch looks better in person. Read lots of reviews about the stock band being short but it wasn't a concern for me as I ordered my watch with the Modena Panerai black band upgrade. The rubber band really dresses up the watch nicely and adds a diving watch quality to it. I've included some pictures with my review with the ""wet"" look and I think it's a great upgrade to an already awesome watch!"
2,"Second citizen eco-drive watch, second failure.","This watch failed to hold a charge after about 2 months, if that. I left it out to charge in direct sunlight and it would , on a good day, work for a few more hours. I returned it to the factory under warranty,ALONG WITH MY OTHER ECO-DRIVE watch that STOPPED WORKING and they sent it back to me ""FIXED"" and the same thing happened after one WEEK. I left it out in the sunlight and to my astonishment it worked for about half an hour before dying on me again. Upon leaving it out for almost my entire work day I forgot about it and someone stole it. End of story, never buying another citizen (piece of crap) watch again. My original eco-drive has begun working again but I wouldnt reccomend these watches to anyone who wants a working timekeeper. Not a bad bracelet though."
3,Interesting read but struggles for consistent tone,"I was so encouraged by the first chapter. The vision of plastic surgeon trainees working on cadaver heads as an erstwhile ""mask factory"" had me chuckling aloud. Perhaps the book should have stopped there as a magazine article.The book doesn't know whether it is serious or humorous, whether it is history or satire. Obviously reluctant to make any humor at the expense of victims of plane crashes, the author does a complete change of tone in a chapter about how causes of death can be gleaned from the condition of bodies. That's all fine and good but it was like not even reading the same book. STIFF gets derailed at that point and never gets back on track... wandering between science and humor but without much focus as to either.Not a waste of time, but a disappointment given its apparent promise."
5,Very detailed!,"I would highly recommend this book to anyone who has a fascination with dead people. It was almost refreshing to know that I'm not a freak. I just think that a dead body, the way it looks, and what happens to it is so fascinating. This book even includes the history of what has happened to dead bodies over the years which at times made my tummy a little squimmish. Just loved, loved, loved this book."
5,You'll die laughing!,"This is, undeniably, one of the funniest, most fascinating books I've ever read. I always admired Mary Roach's wicked Salon columns, but this has to be the pinnacle of wicked humor. A great, devilish read!"
5,Fascinating!,A great read/listen - amazing detail told in an entertaining fashion. I've bought this book for a half dozen friends and everyone has enjoyed it. Not nearly as gruesome as it might seem from the title or subject matter. Highly recommended.
3,Darkly humorous but just a bit too long,"I really enjoyed the majority of this book. There were parts that made me giggle aloud, however, I was disappointed by how tangential some chapters seemed. A few of the later chapters were quite boring and seemed to be included to increase the number of pages. The modern information was great. Like some other reviewers said, this is not for the squeamish. Beware if you are someone who cannot mentally separate someone's cadaver from who they were when they were alive."
4,Cadaver Insight,"Stiff is a great read - funny, insightful, and well-written. Roach just pulls you along from one chapter to the next - it is so hard to put down.The details and descriptions of what is done to corpses, and has been done to them historically, are fascinating. I would have given it 5 stars if I were able to talk about any of this book with my husband or circle of friends. Without the context of the book the people around me think any details I attempt to discuss with them are horrendously gruesome.The inevitability of every body's decay - no matter what method of burial (or other) is chosen - was definite food for thought for me.It's not the author's fault that time has marched on since she wrote the book, but I did find the info about Body Wars at the end outdated (and her feelings that it would never be welcome in North America haven't rung true).Great book, great read, so INTERESTING."
5,:),I love this book. It's differnt and makes the gorry sciencey stuff about cadavars more palatable. Its actually kinda funny and great to read.
4,"Macabre, but Funny",What I could stomach of this book was very funny! I just don't deal well with the topic in particular and was reading this for a book club. I was not able to finish it. The author writes very well and treats a rather gross topic with humor and respect.
3,Funny and fun.,"This book will satisfy the scientific and curious, but not the gore seekers. While the magic of reading any book is to use you imagination to see and understand what the author is describing, this book gives just enough to do so. I am a huge fan of gore and explicit description as well as pictures. This book just doesn't deliver any of that. The author played it safe in descriptions of the subjects she observed. But to each his own and great read otherwise. Love the price I snagged it for here on the Amazon site also!"
4,Reading with Tequila,"Why read: I loved Roach's other novel, Bonk.What impressed me: Roach really researches the hell out of her subjects, always shocking readers with the depth of information she comes up with. Stiff is no different, informing of every conceivable aspect of the body after death, peppered with sick moments, funny moments and more often a combination of the two.What disappointed me: There was a little more of a historical aspect to Stiff than I would have been interested in, but given the subject matter there really is only so much you can learn about today without taking a good long look at history.Recommended: Yes. While cadavers weren't as entertaining to me as sex, this was still an amazing book."
4,And you thought Soylent Green was a shocker,"Stiff, by Mary Roach will take you into a world of cadavers that stay above ground for post mortem careers you would never have imagined. Only a skillful writer with a light touch can make a good read out of a subject so macabre. Along with her interviews of people who are using cadavers in unusual ways, Mary Roach also gives you fascinating insights into how cadavers fared above ground in the historical past. .A great read for those who thought they knew at least a little about everything."
3,Hmmm...who knew???,"The first part of the book was great. It then took a bizarre turn for several chapters. It ended well, but those odd chapters kind of spoiled it for me."
2,Left much to be desired.,"My book club chose this book and I was intrigued. It sounded like an interesting read, and certainly a topic about which I knew little. And while the book delivered on the interesting, Roach decided to waylay an appropriate tackling of the subject with numerous asides, jokes and puns, all of which were grating and many of which were groan-inducing. Additionally, any insight into her journalistic integrity made me embarrassed for her, as she seemed most interested in probing her subjects for pedestrian or off topic information. After finishing the book, I learned that some of her facts were wrong, which isn't surprising, as she constantly mentions simply ""skimming"" academic articles or even being distracted by more sensational information. While it held my interest, I wouldn't recommend this book, and feel there are probably better works on the subject for anyone looking to find out about the world of cadavers and the death industry."
4,Very pretty!!! Limited versatility.,"Great product! My only complaint is that there are pockets that only hold a certain size photo. For example, this album will not hold 5x7's."
4,A Very Good Beginning,"If you're looking to learn the basics of PHP and how it connects the web with databases, this is a very good starting point. The author takes the time to teach all of the basics of MySQL and PHP (even referencing differences between versions) and provides clear examples of two common uses of PHP - online catalogs and member-only sites.One note though - you most definitely want to have a decent grasp of HTML and at least the basics of SQL before you start into this.Overall it was well worth reading."
2,Didn't help my acne or keratosis,"I bought this product hoping it would do miracles for my acne and keratosis. I had been using products containing lots of glycolic acid and was looking for something more gentle. After about a week, my face started to break out A LOT. My cheeks were covered in small bumps. My pores looked clogged and dirty. The keratosis on my arms seemed to look worse. Keep in mind, my skin is extremely stubborn and not many products work for me.This stuff does make a good cuticle oil."
4,Smells great!,"Wow - the smell is amazing!!! And it's not too heavy like oils usually are so it doesn't take too long to dry. But i don't think it's a 100% sea buckthorn oil, at least my bottle doesn't say that but i hope it's still gonna help with my acne (i also use a prescribed topical cream). It took a long time for them to ship it but i wasn't amazons fault as far as i understand and honestly in this case it didn't bother me."
2,Save your $$$$$$,"Super expensive and really so no difference in this oil and other much less expensive oils.. I think its a bunch of hype and people are making a lot of money off peoples hunger for something that is a miracle, which don't exist . Actually, I think bio oil works much better and about one-tenth of the price"
3,"A Bounce Back From His Previous Book, But Still Not Great","After Reading The Web, I promised myself I would never read Jonathan Kellerman again. I broke my promise to myself when I picked up The Clinic, and I guess I'm glad I did. While this book is not a return to the greatness of the earlier Alex Delaware novels, at least it's a step in the right direction. If not for a completely unrealistic ending, I would be giving this book four stars. Kellerman does a great job of building up the mystery and unfortunately the payoff falls flat. Let's hope that this book marks the beginning of a new start for this series and that The Web was only a misstep."
3,Lukewarm recovery from The Web,"I'm a fan of Jonathon Kellerman so I decided to forgive him his stunning failure (in my humble opinion, of course) in The Web. This book takes Alex Delaware out of the clouds and out of the Carribean and places him back in Southern California where he belongs. This book is back-to-the-basics Kellerman. You have a crime, a twisting plot, and an interesting solution to an interesting mystery. None of the Nuclear wastoid science-fiction mumbo jumbo Kellerman resorted to in the Web. Thanks Mr. Kellerman for bringing me a reason to read some more of your novels. Now, I hope you'll find a little more inspiration so I can give a better review than its ""Good, A heckuva lot better than his last one.&quot"
5,a page turner keeps you reading all night.,"Non stop action from beginng to end. Kellerman has done it again. Keeps you on the edge of your seat, also keeps you guessing on who did it. Hated to see it end, in fact I was a little disappointed in the ending, but it has to end that way. Looking forward to J. Kellerman's next book. For those of you who enjoy mystery, suspense and just a good read this book is for you"
3,From one clinician to another,"From one clinician author to another. Kellerman teams his detective with psychologist Alex Delaware one more time to find a memorable killer dispatching clinicians. Kellerman has a knack for getting inside the mind of perps and innocents--and making readers uncertain which is which. He's a master. --PJ Adams, psychotherapist and author of Freud's Revenge"
3,Where's the editor?,"I've enjoyed an occasional Kellerman for a reliable escapist mystery and his background as a child psychologist adds an interesting dimension. Regrettably I found that not only was this one too long - it could have used a good deal of editing - but I had the feeling Kellerman was just going through the motions. The first part of the book was just one tedious interview after another with nothing happening. And the plot reminded me of another one in the series I had previously read - (spoiler coming) 'oh yes, seemingly upstanding successful doctor doing something nefarious at a private clinic' and the one I had already read was better. It must be hard to sustain a successful series and to keep coming up with something new. I won't give up on this series, but this is definitely the least interesting one I've read."
2,Lair,"I just finished re-reading this book having read about 10 years ago and was quite dissapointed, i love Domain, the whole idea behind it and the characters, but Lair is like a spin off of it. The characters arent fleshed out well, theres the usual tough guy with problems and the vunerable female who (as usual) get together. Then theres the rats themselves; they seem to manage to kill everyone within minutes but the hero always manages to escape mostly unscathed. Its a little too straight forward and predictable, not herberts best."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"Rat hunting sequel.The sequel isn't as good as first Rats book, and the setting is somewhat different.A man whose family was slaughtered by the mutant vermin joins an outfit that is tasked with destruction of said little monsters.So on a different scale, and not much of a link at all to the earlier book, apart from the beasts themselves.2.5 out of 5"
3,Just OK,"I did sort of enjoy the first novella but found myself wondering what might happen afterwards. The second novella started off well enough but as the book wore on, the story took an unexpected turn. These siblings were a little too freaky for my tastes. I was curious about the third story of the brother but I don't know. This book is very explicit and you will want something cold to drink while reading. If you want a hot book, then this is one to have. The story line could use a little more depth though."
3,GREAT PRODUCT / TERRIBLE SERVICE,"I just purchased the powerboook and was very happy with it. I had an issue with it and called the Apple ""HELP LINE"" to resolve it. Very smug and almost resentful reply from the techs. I just spent 2300.00 on a product, out of the mainstream and the response I got overshadowed the products performance, sadly to say. I like Apple products, also got the new 4gig iPod, but they will suffer so long as they cannot meet the customers concerns, much like microsoft stopped doing..."
1,way too small,Like hte long sleeved version of this shirt the sizing is way off. I wear a medium shirt and this felt more like an extra small. I would not recommend it.
1,"Self destructed, terribly cheap product","This was a cheap poorly engineered product right from the start. Became very hot through normal use, to the point where inflating one normal sized car tire would cause faint smoke to come out of the air vents. After inflating two low tires on my Honda Accord the compressor siezed from its own heat, never to work again. Get a different product."
1,Junk,"This Slime COMP03 air compressor should not be listed on your website. It run for 18 min.to go from 30psi to 35psi on one tire. The noise level was unbearable. The light was just ok, not bright, but air came on the light when dead. After one tire I gave up and put in were it belonged, the trashcan. The name should be Shame not Slime."
1,Lasted less than two minutes before failing,This pump lasted less than two minutes before the compressor broke. Slime will not honor the promised one year warranty.
1,Cheap and you get what you pay for,"The door to the storage compartment falls off due to design, the gauge is not accurate, and it takes FOREVER to inflate a tire. I have been using it for inflating bicycle tires and air mattresses so far. The first time I tried to put air in my tire (50psi), the pump burned out just over 40psi. It is extremely light duty."
1,On to the next one!,"I have a slow leak (non-repairable) in a mini-van tire. The tire requires 32 psi and has to be aired up every few days. The instructions say not to run the compressor more than ten minutes without a break. Apparently, ten minutes is its max as after 12 minutes the diaphragm blew out and the tire started LOSING air. Fortunately, the store where I bought it took it back as defective. On to the next one!"
2,very loud..,"the product works as described. However, it is too loud with a disturbing operation. I am returning it!"
5,I am a believer,These are the best sounding headphones I have ever owned. I've tried so many styles of headphones and I basically settled into some sony MDR-V700's because they were great for listening to R&B and hip-hop. But after one ear stopped working I searched the web for a suitable replacement. I tried a couple different high end headphones out but for the amount of money I was spending I wasn't satisfied with the sound quality. But these Ultrasone's are better than I expected. The bass is powerful but not overwhelming. It is so crisp and clearly defined making it suitable for all types of music. These headphones are great for listing to DVD's because they capture every sound accurately. I found myself listening to every song I could just because I was so blown away with the definition of the sound. Its like sitting in a room full of speakers. Get them now.
5,great for ipod/computer,"For all those wondering if these headphone work well with an ipod or computer, the answer is yes! they sound amazing. the sound is lifelike, and extremely clear. highly recommended without a doubt."
5,Outstanding!,"These earphones are well made and sound great. In fact I'm listening to Alan Parsons as I type this message. A few have complained of hearing clicks and other audio artifacts. That's because the phones are very accurate.Buy them, you won't be sorry."
5,A wonderful look at America at the turn of the last century,"""Ragtime"" is a wonderful journey into Turn-of-the-Century America where racism against blacks, immigrants and others provide the dramatic source for this rich tale. In my judgement, it should have won the Best Bicture oscar in 1981. The music by Randy Newman is terrific and should be rereleased on CD. Would love to get this film on DVD."
2,ragtime musical,when i purchased the video i thought it was the musical that i had seen in New York. As it turns out it's a movie about the musical.
3,Glad I bought it,The sepia tone and setting add to sensuality of the well defined male form. It's good to see well toned male body that is not the overly developed muscle form. Keeping it on end table for all to see.
1,Warning!!!,I have a lot of books on this subject matter. This book is like the same picture on every page. No art here. Don't bother. Trust me.
5,Did the job,This roller frame was just what my painting job needed. The paint went on smoothly and was very easy to get the roller cover off when done.
5,Another happy home maker,"My wife has wanted a Kitchen Aid Stand mixer for quite sometime. She has just put off buying it. I made the purchase as a birthday gift. She was very happy to receive it. She has used every weekend since she got it and has very satisfied. The dough hook has produced bread, pizza crust and other goodies. I have been a restaurant manager for the last thirty years and seen my share of kitchen equipment. This compares well with commercial equipment. Buy one you will love it."
4,"Fantastic mixer - not crazy about the bowl, however","When I needed a new mixer, I was only interested in KitchenAid (mom and grandma both had KitchenAids). I've had it for 5+ years and love it. However, if I were in charge of improvements, I'd make 2 changes in the bowls immediately: (1) Wrap the handle in a soft plastic/rubber/silicone - anything that makes it more comfortable to hold. It's too narrow and the edges are so dang sharp! (2) Widen the bowl from top to bottom. It's tippy and the top is too small to get a spatula and beaters in it at same time.I plan to use it until it dies and then I'll replace it with another KitchenAid."
3,KitchenAid mixers quality has gone downhill,"Functionality: 5 starsDurability: 1 starThe mixed (no pun intended) reviews that you've been reading about KitchenAid mixers are true. The one that received worked great for a couple weeks, until I noticed that the head tilt lock would work itself to the unlock position after about 10 minutes, then the unit would vibrate excessively. Amazon is sending me a replacement, hope this one will work better.Basically, these mixers are great when they're working, but their durability and quality has gone downhill since their glory days."
5,Great deal for the price,"This was purchased as a Christmas gift for my brother who is a huge earnhardt and earndart jr. fan. He was very pleased. This was a great price for and came quickly. My only complaint would be the price of shipping.But overall,a GREAT product and well worth it to see the smile on my brothers face."
5,Great clock/ thermometer,This keeps you on time and lets you monitor the weather and temps inside and out. later on I plan to get at least one more monitor for outside(can have up to three).
5,Weather at a Glance!,"We received this weather station as a gift and have really enjoyed it. So, we decided that if we liked it, we might as well share the wealth. We've given this as a gift and it was very well received. It's nice to see what the forecast is going to be, and what the high & low has been. The only thing that proved annoying was when my husband accidently turned the alarm on. It took us days to figure out where the faint beeping sound was coming from. (Smile)"
4,"Good read for the neophyte, but the acronmyns will kill you!","For someone looking to understand the nuts and bolts of the client/server world, this is a good, one-stop ""shop"" to find it. But I would urge its authors to include a glossary of acronymns -- or to at least include every acronymn in the index. The TLAs are ubiquitous and hard to remember from one chapter to the next!"
2,Just okay,Spend money on some other great movies.I bought this just to see Madchen Amick.This is a classic old movie and story ended okay.
2,"""They smile in your face....""","Skinny leads who confuse sadomasochism for a meaningful relationship double-cross one another along with John Lithgow, until everyone, by default, is double-crossing him- or herself, not to mention everyone in the phone book whose surname starts with the same letter as theirs. If this is your idea of entertainment, seek this one out. I'm thinking of feeding mine to the dumpster. Two stars, and only because the brilliant John Lithgow can make anything worth watching while he's on the screen."
1,"An insult to Christianity, Catholicism in particular...","To say that this book is unworthy of review is to make an understatement. The ""facts"" portrayed in this work are easy to characterize as misleading and in some cases are nothing more than the author's mere opinion. While not a Christian, or more specifically Catholic, I can see how this book might be offensive to those of this faith. The author could have expressed his opinions in a newspaper without wasting so much paper stock, time and effort. Refunds, anyone?"
1,Another Anti-Catholic Diatribe from Element Books,Just look at some of the slections published by Element Books and you can see why nothing by them can be taken seriously. These titles incude:The Jesus Conspiracy: The Turin Shroud and the Truth About the ResurrectionThe Elements of GnosticismThe Illustrated Bloodline of the Holy Grail: The Hidden Lineage of Jesus RevealedNo wonder these items are in the New Age section of bookstores and not in Christianity.
5,Very good book...,It is obvious that previous reviews have been made twice toreduce average rating on purpose. However it doesn't changethe reality that this is a very good book. It covers networkingtechnologies very well and it is a well written informative book.It made 3 editions after all. I warmly recommend this book. Itis a good reference to keep in your technical library.
5,Very Inpirational!,This book gets to the heart of the matter about what it is about Bruce Lee that made him so unique. I would recommend this book to anyone who needs to be inspired. It shows the human side of Bruce Lee.
5,Breathtaking,"I love this CD. The new material is elegant, edgy and enveloping. All of the new compostions are just breathtaking, and the arrangements of the standards are great too. All of the elements are in place and the CD's feel is relaxed and infused with fun. Great music!"
2,Item title needs to include scale,"No where in the product description does it mention that the item is an ""O"" scale building kit. I was disapointed because I had search for ""HO"" scale items and thought this was the scale I wanted. Very disapointed when opening the box to find the ""O"" scale kit."
1,Trailer park,"I wanted this in ""HO"" scale. Should it become available as such, I would buy three or four kits to make a true trailer park for my train layout."
1,Can you get it right,I ordered this belt according to item# and model# and it did not fit. I requested help with this matter and did not receive a reply. I will not be purchasing this type of item from you again.
4,Nice,The pad is actually worth the price that you pay. It's not as nice as it could be but I quite enjoy it. The pillows on the other hand aren't all that great...it's almost too bad that I couldn't just buy the pad alone. All in all I'd recomend this item.
1,Came missing a pillow.,I am really not a picky person but I can't say that I'm very happy with this topper. I bought it as a gift for Christmas and was kinda pissed when I found out that one of the pillows was missing.
2,Was not impressed,"When I received the item it said to leave out for 24 hours to let it rise back to its original form(due to compression in packaging). It STILL - weeks later - is not right. The pillow looks nothing like the pictures: the pad has different depths, and it is just not a great product throughout."
2,Very low density memory foam!!!,"I would not technically consider this ""memory foam"". It is super light weight and low density. When you press your hand into the cushion, instead of leaving an imprint of your hand, the foam fluffs back up right away. I've purchased a much cheaper 2"" memory foam that weighed about twice as much as this one, and it provided much more support and cushion.One thing people seem to leave out in their review is that this mattress pad has several small holes for ""ventilation"" throughout the entire body. Beware!The quality of the foam is cheap, but I must admit it was comfortable. Unfortunately, this comfort only lasted a few months. So with everything considered, this is a very overpriced memory foam pad with a ridiculous original price tag. I do not recommend this pad if you're looking for memory foam!"
1,not what it described,"i have always been pleased with my purchases i have made on Amazon, but this one was a dud! it is supposed to be a 3"" topper and after leaving it out for 3 days I still can only measure 2 1/2"" at best. the pillows are a joke. I guess I got what i paid for, but it is definely not up to Amazon standards."
4,Perfect For RVs,"We bought one of these to use in our new RV to improve the mattress that it came with. This mattress pad improved that lumpy spring box by 5X to 10X into a comfortable sleeping cloud. The only downside that a exact size was not available for our ""Short Queen"" mattress. We had to purchase a ""Queen"" in order for it to fit the width dimensions. Once the mattress pad arrived and it was installed. We decided to use in it's slightly oversized condition."
3,Good deal. Smells funny.,"We received the mattress pad in a timely manner. My son loves it...BUT it has a funny odor. I'm hoping it will eventually go away. Otherwise, I will have to let it air out in the garage after a few rounds of Febreeze."
4,Great value,Have been loving this for 6 months. Would recommend getting one at least this thick no thinner.Don't use the pillows at home. Cut one for sleeping bags and one in car in case I get kicked out of the house again. Just kidding.No regrets.PeaceRick
2,Didnt really feel it. Way too hot,"I had purchased this prior to buying a new firm, Simmons Beauty Rest mattress. I was planning on just using it with my old mattress. I had slept 2 very comfortable nights with my new mattress when the mattress topper arrived. After letting it air out for a few hours, it stretched out to its final size (no smell btw.) The first night, I threw the pillow on the floor because my face was sweating. I live in Florida, but always have the AC blasting. My body was also very hot and I twisted and turned all night. I tried it one more night and the same thing. This thing is very hot. Even covered with 2 sheets, its still uncomfortably warm."
4,Sleep softly,"One of the best purchases I have done in along time coming. It is the hand that rocks the cradle. A little warm in the summer temps, but as a whole...sleeping like I was a kid again."
1,disapointing,this product was old & discolored and would not fluff out to its 3 inches. Terrible product. I went to Walmart and got 4inch for same price and it fluffed up immediately. I do not recommend this product!
5,Classic Ginastera,"Ginastera who was present during the original recordings, must have been overjoyed having Barbara Nissman. She is the ideal pianist to capture the elemental power of his ferocious gaucho-inspired folk rhythms. Her rhythmic exuberance and bravura have to be heard to be believed. It reveals Ginastera as the Bartok of Argentina as their respective treatment of gaucho and Magyar folklore is perfectly analogous. She clearly understands this point too as her stylistic insight is just as incisive in the chamber works on volume 2 as in the solo piano pieces comprising volume 1. Originally recorded on Newport records in 1992, they are now safely achived on Pierian label and protected from the deletions axe. Justly so. Nissman's spontaneity, exhilaration and stylistic insight make these performances classics that will never date."
3,works great,I CARRYI THIS PUMP ON MY ATV IV USED IT ABUNCH OF TIMES IT PUMPS VERY FAST I WISH IT HAD A DIGITAL GAUGE ON IT THATS WHY I GAVE IT 3STARS I HIGHLY RECOMEND THIS ITEM
1,One time use,"Bought it and gave it a try. Seemed to be okay for emergency use. I carried on my bike for a couple of years before needing it. The chuck would not seal on the tire and the end result was loosing an additional 10 psi before I stopped trying.I tried it again at home, under friendlier conditions. Still could not get a seal. I suppose I could try to find a better chuck, but I don't want to discover some other cheap failure when in need.To the junk bin."
3,Slime Inflator,I'm Glad the little compressor is in the saddle bag of my motorcycle. I would recommend it. I does take a little time to top off a MC tire. The only thing I dont like is that the instructions advise the pump has to cool down for about 25 minutes or so after using it for 10 minutes. If I was refilling a flat on my bike i would run it for as long as needed and then throw it out if it seized up. The cheap little tire gauge included is somewhat accurate.
4,"Works, does what it's suppose to","The product worked fine for me. However, if your going to be filling multiple tires on a car, you need to let the compressor cool down before each tire, it gets hot enough to burn you at the base of the hose, where it connects to the compressor. Other than that, love the compact size, and attachment options. I would suggest this product."
2,need built in psi guage model,I should have gotten the one with the built in air guage. The connection for the air steam on the tire is difficult to secure and remove without losing air pressure.
5,Great product,"Fits nicely in my saddlebag, and gives me peace of mind - great for trips that take me out of my home territory."
5,Love this music!,"I love all of Carmen's songs, his voice and lyrics are so moving! Listen to the message each song brings, it really makes you feel so good and really think about God and the message."
5,I was happily surprised,The seller described the item very well but it being used the cd was in better condition than I had hoped it would be. I received the item in a timely manner. Wouldn't hesitate to order from this seller again.
5,This is the best album Carman ever made,"THIS ALBUM IS EXCELLENT With high prasing songs like Who's In The House, Great God, Marchin' and Movin this is among the only albums where I like all the songs. If your looking for one good Christian CD this is it. This is among the best Christian albums ever. I recommend this album 100 percent yes. You gotta just buy this CD. This is the second best album I've ever heard. The last song America Again will really get you thinkin that this country needs a change. May God Bless You"
3,Check before you order....,"We wanted to replace an older model that we've used for many years. This one is oval-shaped and larger. That's not so bad. We noticed that the clear steamer bowl is MUCH flimsier on this model. Our older one cracked after several years, and the handle tab broke off. I'm just waiting for this one to break any day now. I see the HS900 model is available, and that is the one we probably should have ordered. We still enjoy using the steamer and have always appreciated the quality of the steamed vegetables it produces."
4,My View,This is the third Black and Decker rice and veggie steamer we have owned because we like the simplicity of design and the ease of using and cleaning this steamer. We do find with this third one that the perforated bowl for steaming is much flimsier than the first two we owned. The bowl is too flexible for me to feel it will last as long as our first two B&D steamers.
5,black & decker steamer,"This steamer is a perfect size for a family of four, we love the vegetables steamed, but recently I used it to steam rice and wild rice with spices and then used this for chicken fried rice on a grill and it was wonderful according to my family."
1,PLASTIC DOES NOT HOLD UP,THE STEAM BASKET AND THE STEAM BASKET BOTTOM TRAY START CRACKING AFTER A YEAR.DOES NOT MEET BLACK AND DECKER STANDARDS
5,Black and Decker. Steamer,"This is my third of this product. The style changes but the quality remains the same, excellent and reliable. The first one was round and transferred it to my summer home. It is still in use. The second one was oval and I used it for more than 7 years. When storing it, I dropped it and the plastic basket chipped This was in a place that it would not make a seal. I rely on Amazon to help locate items. I ordered this one which is Also oval and has several more features, definitely an upgrade. Good reliable people to do business with."
3,Dying Breed,"Four friends delve deep into the forests of Tasmania in search of a creature that was thought to be extinct, but what they find is a new breed of terror entirely... Director Jody Dwyer packs a great deal of shock and suspense into DYING BREED, a survivalist horror film from Down Under. The keen editing and sound design help to heighten the impact and exhilarating rush of adrenaline during these moments for a terrifying overall effect. Let alone the gore, there are several cringe-worthy scenes that will have audience members reeling in their seats. Leigh Whannel leads a solid cast, and outside of a few questionable decisions, the characters act with intelligence and a survival instinct. What DYING BREED lacks in originality, it makes up for in thrills to prove itself a worthwhile entry in to the survivalist horror genre.-Carl ManesI Like Horror Movies"
2,Average at best,"I have other S&K hand tools that are top notch. This punch set is a little disappointing. The two smallest punches have a noticable curve in them, hopefully I can get that out without breaking one. They came with a film of corrosion already on them and shoved in a cheesy plastic pouch with no dividers. Could not reccomend this set at this point. Better sets out there with higher quality at the same or lower price point."
4,"Punches great, pouch damaged","Received punches promply, they are in great shape. Bottom of pouch was ripped out, put some tape on it to seal it and it's fine. All in all I'm happy."
2,Big disappointment!,"Although this is a substantial piece, made of some stone-like material, not ""resin"", i.e., plastic, the overall quality is poor. The gold highlights were obviously applied in a hurry. Very sloppy! If I had seen this item on a store shelf I would not have purchased it. I would return it, but that would be like flushing $ down the toilet. I may do it anyway, on principle. Caveat emptor! (Let the buyer beware!)"
4,Mostly fillers...,"but good fillers none-the-less. No real serious developments yet, but we do learn a little more about Chi's past, as Minoru receives a strange picture of her on the internet. Hideki goes on his first date with Yumi, and there are a few interesting surprises. This series is just so cute and funny. Chi buys Hideki a present (a porno magazine that he doesn't have yet, lol), and then when Hideki gets freaked out by a spooky murder story, he begins to think that a murderous spirit is downstairs in the apartment below him. Which makes for a very entertaining episode. Then there's the virtual reality game Hideki borrows so he can play with Chi, and because he's never played a game like this before, he has no idea what he's doing, so Shinbo and Sumomo come help him out. But when they start the game, Chi is nowhere to be found! This really is a great series that everyone will enjoy!!"
1,Poor Charles would spit on this,"I'm a songwriter who never considered a pre-nuptual agreement. However...I'm calling my lawyer as I write. If my wife ever tries to publish some poor piece of crap that I scribbled on a bar napkin while intoxicated...why I'll...I'll...SUE!!! There's obviously a piece of Bukowski in this book, albeit a small piece, and if that's enough for his fans to gobble up then so be it. Me, I love the guy too much to spit on his memory. Sounded to me like Linda even finished a few of them herself. Please read EVERYTHING else he's written and pass on this stuff."
5,"A lot of facts, a sharp critique!","In the last two decades we have been witnessing a wave of ""reform"" in education. The discourse behind these reforms is one that says that there is only one correct way of educating: the ""Right"" way. Michael Apple's book is extremely important because it maps out the efforts of the conservative modernization movement in converting their ideology in common sense and thus making their ideology the legitimate one, the one that makes sense. With a sophisticated theoretical framework and a plethora of concrete examples, Apple shows how the conservative reforms are in fact a struggle to constitute a particular view into official knowledge and to make other views of society not plausible. This is a book that will interest everyone who is involved in the field of education or social sciences."
3,Howl Wolf,"This is a very cute toy. I have to say that it was much smaller than I expected. It should be described as a 6-7 inch not a 9 inch toy. I just purchased another ""9 inch wolf"" from a different seller and it was much larger. This one is ""beanie babie"" size."
1,Moodswings~ Mettle Music,"Do not buy this CD believing it to be by the group Moodswings, famous for Moodfood, Psychadelicatessen and Horizontal. It is actually a CD called Moodswings by the group Mettle Music. I have reported this to Amazon as their search criteria is very misleading. Once again, this is Moodswings by Mettle Music, not Mettle Music by Moodswings."
5,inner weigh,I have seen the inner weigh with several of my friends and have purchased the dvd as gifts because I truly appreciated how this was not a DIET but more a way of changing one's life--by changing their lifestyle. Only when a person holds him/her self accountable for their unhealthy habits will they realize that they hold the key to changing their own behaviors. Too often people look for answers elsewhere- in a pill/diet/ a guru-etc and for that reason the success rates are minimal. Weight loss products are abundant because people are searching for the answer everywhere and anywhere. As soon as a person realizes there is only one way to become the healthy person they wish to be-and that they alone are the answer to their struggles--they will be successful in releasing their weight and the issues which surround it--and their lives will become the happiness filled journey they desire...The Inner Weigh
5,My Favorite New York Guide Book,"This is my favorite New York Guidebook. I lived in New York City for 5 years, and although I was in my thirties, whenever my friends would come to visit me in New York, I would pull out my Kid's Guide to New York to remind me of the most fun things to do in the city. Too bad it is 12 years old. Much of the material is still valuable, and it wouldn't take much to update it for 2002. I'd like to give a copy to a 9 year old who will be visiting the city for the first time next month."
4,"A worthwhile read, but not as gripping as others","Campbell's latest addition to the ""disaster at sea"" genre, while a good read, isn't quite as gripping as works by his contemporaries such as Spike Walker (""Working on the Edge"", ""Nights of Ice,"" and ""Coming Back Alive"") or Sebastian Junger. Nevertheless, he does a masterful job of recreating the stories of four separate clam boat disasters in the early part of 1999. He also does an excellent job of describing the work of clam boats, as well as the problems encountered by those working in the profession. Campbell sheds a great deal of light on the problem with unseaworthy boats that are so common in the northeast fishing industry. In sum, this is a good addition to the library of anyone who loves stories of disaster at sea, but don't expect the intensity found in more popular works."
3,Close to Metalflake but not quite.,It's more a metallic color than true metalflake and the paint clogs the nozzle frequently despite constant shaking.Paint squirts out in globs and drips.looks nice though once it's sanded and cleared coated over.
1,Dull Read,"I was very disappointed with this book. How does a story get published when it appears never to have been proofread? There were SO MANY avoidable mistakes that it really took away from any enjoyment in the storyline. Besides the poor editing, the story was just plain dull and without excitement."
4,Goin Home Creates More Problems Than It Solves,"Kali O'Brian has enough troubles on her hands as her sibblings dump the clean out of the family home in her lap. Kali feels she can ill afford the time away from her own career, but it is a job that must be done when a death occurs.SHADOW OF DOUBT by Jonnie Jacobs is a fast read as Kali a young lawyer is sucked into the investigation when an old romance Eddie Marrero, now marries to her best friend is murdered.This is a fast read and a good introduction to a new series.Nash Black, author of SANDPRINTS OF DEATH."
4,Classic Carman,"This was one of my first Christian albums I ever bought. And it is still one of my favorites. Although ""The Ressureciton Rap"" sounds kind of hoaky, there are many bright spots on this album. God's Got An Army is a fun song. Saved, Delivered, and Healed has a great message, and This Blood still practically makes me cry when I think of what Jesus went through for us. I cannot reccomend this album highly enough. Get it today!"
5,Great songs......,I love Carman...to me he is one of the best gospel singers around....wish he was still recording music these days...
3,JFK assassination reading material,"Try reading David Sheim's 'Contract On America' and Mark North's 'Act Of Treason'. These two books are very good introductory material concerning the JFK assassination. If you take the time to read these books, you will know why they are not heavily publicized. Sheim was actually hounded for several years and fired from his government job for suspicious reasons. Many of the same personalities are referenced in both books, making them all the more convincing. Sheim's book has a fascinating review of Mafia plots and infiltration in one of it's appendices."
2,poorly told story,"A poorly told story and the writer doesn't convince me at all.Ok, he probably did it (LBJ) or was at least involved but the writing and evidence from this book is really minimal.You better spend your money on some other book."
1,Awful,"Read Publisher's weekly review. Spot on: vague, repetitive, self serving and contrived.Junk. Wouldn't even make good fiction.I was hoping for some interesting insight into all the players and got convoluted connections to Johnson's ""thinking and therefore actions.Pure garbage. If Johnson and Clark were so loathsome why did McClellan work for the law firm and ""serve"" for 5 years the evil combine ?Claptrap. A total waste of money.I guess you can find a market for any sort of paranoid musings if you look hard enough. Or if your rhetoric is as foam flecked and irresponsible as this author's is, you can find some crackpot ""progressive"" publisher to inflict this crap on the public.Not even on the level of a college thesis.There was no rating for less than on star. Too bad."
1,"Please, don't waste your time!","With Robery Caro now having completed three volumes of his biography of Lyndon Johnson, readers are well-advised to spend their time on those books, rahter than this sad effort. Avoid at all costs. [Don't let the single star fool you, this book deserves NO stars]"
1,Lies in the Family,"This book is almost as phony as his son's recent book about President Bush. I guess making things up and lying for money runs in the family. Can't wait until he sells the film rights to Oliver ""Che"" Stone."
5,Did LBJ Kill JFK?,"Barr McClellan joined the Clark, Thomas firm just after I left. It's hard to believe Edward Clark participated in the assassination of Johnson. Less so for others. Johnson was a bad man. I never understood why. He sucked the oxygen out of any room he entered. World Class Ego. I left the firm because I couldn't stand Johnson - even though I had nothing to do with the firm's representation of him.Barr has done a service here. I recommend the book. If you want to read a different take on the firm - how humorous it all was if you didn't take it seriously - get my little book of comic scenes - LawToons. It should be on Amazon.com JimK"
2,"I agree, basically, with Christopher Chase","I found this book nearly impossible to read. I don't think Smart's opinions are as passe as the other reviewer did, though they would have been uncontroversial so long ago. Smart's basic concern seems to be to avoid any kind of controversy. His perspectives are so mundane that they're boring. Further, his train of thought often amounts to hesitant implications rather than arguments.I think he misunderstands Theravada Buddhism very badly. I wouldn't have thought he was in Eliade's tradition. I've read a lot of Eliade books, but I don't know why the other reviewer said that he was. At any rate, Eliade's books are all much better than this. In short, I can't imagine why anyone would want to read this book. Instead, I recommend books by Mircea Eliade, Huston Smith, Solomon Nigosian, William James, Karen Armstrong, Evelyn Underhill, Levi-Strauss, Rudolph Otto, Mary Douglas, Clifford Geertz... nearly anyone..."
2,Disappointed,"Good performance by Marvin and the band, but the sound is soooooo weak. Marvin never gets the audio prominence he deserves in this DVD."
4,The best MG live finally around,"It's finally here! I saw that one a long time ago on the german/french television ARTE and was dying to see it released on a quality dvd.If you're a big fan of MG and knows everything about him and his tourmented life -especially at this time- (if not, you have to read the book 'Divided soul' by David ritz) you will certainly enjoy this concert. Top band, top notch picture quality and sound (it's 1980 guys !), this is the best MG live video around.Make sure you check the amazing version of Inner City blues with MG sitting at the fender for a soulful solo while the incredible background singers are grooving like craaazay! Also for Claude Nobs presenting a ... award (not even framed for god sakes LOL) to MG at the end...Thanks Eagle Rock, you've just made my day!!!I must tell you something though : NO BONUS ? NO FIFTH STAR !!!"
5,A fascinating story about Carroll Shelby's few failling ventures.,"Eric Davison did a wonderful job while working for Shelby American. If anyone could tell the story, he is the one!Enjoy meeting the cast who participated in building the ""Shelby Series 1""."
4,Good Book,"The book is much smaller that I was expecting. It came with some markings and a curled cover, but the material is great."
5,Only the Best,Just can't beat the Purdy brand... might spend a bit more... performs very well and lasts longer! A greater value than most less expensive brushes... especially considering the quality of the work it allows.
5,rediculous,i've never acually saw this dvd but the comment by Brian Hocum is rediculous. getting an artist in put on something is to better understand where they're coming from or where they're writing. and if anyone knew anything about thrice they would know that they contribute money frome each record to orgunizations even after they left sub city record. so dont be so closed minded and listen to what they're talking about cuz aparently they have better things to say then you.
5,A rare excellent book for Metro Ethernet,"Sam Halabi did it again.This is a rare and very informative book on Metro Ethernet developments.It has very clear explanation on all the subjects.I particularly like the VPLS section.One thing tough,the HVPLS section needs to have more coverage on real world scenario."
4,"Valuable information, she's been there","I loved the first 30 pages of this book, it gave so much insight and valuable information about what to stay away from, what foods triggered attacks, and what you can eat.You can tell she's been through it all. Her descriptions of IBS, I feel like she's talking about me.A lot of the recipes are a little bit hard, especially the soups and main dishes. I can't find catfish anywhere her, or harissa. There are a lot of odd and hard to find ingredients. I suppose I could substitute, but then with IBS, that detracts from the main point of finding out what your body can handle and not handle.Using her information on eating only egg whites, french bread, and watching soluble and insolube fat intake. I have thankfully not suffered an attack in a week.I would definitely recommend this book to anyone with IBS, just for the first 30 pages alone."
2,IBS cooking for the 1%,"If you are less than upper middle class, do not buy this book. The most useful portion is the introductory segment which gives general advice for IBS sufferers. The great majority of the recipes are time consuming, expensive or both. This would be a great cook book for empty nesters who have plenty of time and money to spend on food preparation. Frankly, I am surprised it has been reviewed so highly. A word about me; I have been cooking American and ethnic foods since my teenage years, and bake extensively. This book is not useful for families, as virtually none of the recipes would suit the tastes of my children, or most American children for that matter. Examples: dishes calling for organic egg whites, several exotic types of soy sauce I've never heard of, soy cream cheese, exotic mushrooms, and so on. My advice is; educate yourself regarding safe foods for this condition and search for recipes that can be tweaked or used as-is."
2,So disappointing!,I had high hopes for this book but was sorely disappointed. She uses so much soy! I can't eat soy at all so most of the recipes in this book are useless to me.
2,Not for us,"True to its title, this book contains almost two hundred low-fat and low-residue recipes. If that's what you are after, then this book will serve you well.Alas, everyone is different. As the husband of a (constipated) IBS sufferer, I must point out that these wheat flour, rice, and other complex carbohydrate laden recipes would completely, painfully block up my wife!! In that respect, this book is not what I would recommend to people with IBS.However, the author does actually follow her own diet, which serves her quite well (the diarrhea type of IBS sufferer?). I did like some of the author's points about looking at a change of diet not as a penalty but as a relief, as well as her use suggestion to ""substitute ingredients"" instead of eliminating your favorite foods altogether. Lastly, the nutritional summaries of each recipe add a valuable touch."
2,Tasty Recipes,I like this book. While going through it the recipes are appealing and make you want to prepare them. It is hard being on a low fat diet and this makes it easier...
3,Just another ordinary recipe book,"I purchased this book hoping it would be a clear, day-to-day guide to eating healthy foods that prevented bloating. Instead, the recipes here seemed ordinary and ""unfocused."" This book was of little use to me."
3,Perhaps--,"this will help some IBS folks. However, since IBS is a catch-all diagnosis when nothing can definitively be done, it is possible not everyone ""with"" IBS has the same problem. I say that because if I ate the way she recommends (and I have tried it), I would have increased pain and bloating. So, I would say get this book and experiment but don't be surprised if it doesn't fit your body exactly. Also, it is heavily loaded with soy as the substitute for milk and women with estrogen-positive breast cancer in their family may want to substitute almond or rice milk for the recipes."
2,Not Useful For Everyday Eating,"I bought this book because my husband was just recently diagnosed with IBS and I had found her website and found it very helpful. I was so incredibly excited to get this book and finally be able to cook real food for my husband, but it wasn't nearly as useful as I had expected it to be. The introduction and all the information at the very beginning was very helpful and I use it as a quick cheat sheet whenever something comes up with my husbands syndrome. The recipes, for us, anyway are not at all practical. I feel as though these aren't really recipes for a weeknight dinner, but more for when you have company or are planning a special evening. Also, as has been previously mentioned, she references a lot of ingredients that are not available to us because of where we live and our income. So, I was pretty disappointed and am on the hunt for a better recipe book for IBS."
3,"Good recipes, but incomplete","The recipes and advice in this book look great, and I'm eager to try them, especially since they are low fat. However, the author seems to be writing only for IBS people who suffer from diarrhea, and has ignored those of us who suffer from chronic constipation. Much of the author's advice -- heavy emphasis on soluble fibers like bread, rice, pasta etc. -- risk exacerbating constipation symptoms. I wish she would have addressed this more, as constipation causes just as severe cramping and discomfort as diarrhea. Also, based on my experience, the author's assertion that ALL oils are equally harmful for digestion is simply wrong. I urge other people to try olive oil in moderation -- it definitely is easier on the stomach than butter and other oils. I also question her advice to avoid all dairy products. In my experience, yogurt is very soothing on the stomach."
5,jazz,"Nice find of an old jazz classic. Quite a pair of musicians that came out in the heyday of 50""s jazz. I enjoyed this album (cd) very much."
2,Didn't last two minutes,I bought this toy specifically because it was advertised as tough and industrial strength. It is neither. I have an aggressive chewer who cleared off eight of the treads in two minutes. I had to take it away from him and put it on the shelf. So much for his Christmas present...
4,Works fine under Win7rc. No problem.,"OS auto-installed the driver for the Richo chip that this card uses, on first boot, without feeding it the driver disk. If whatever pcmcia card ye use, can't find the resources to play nice, just swap this card to a different PCI slot and you'll be fine. Sometimes yer computer's nit-picky where it likes which cards to be. One small Caveat: This picture's wrong. It shows a double height slot for taking double thick cards. That's why I bought this'n over the others. But, that isn't what I got. Twas only single height slot. I had to remove the bracket & widen the slot out with a dremmel to fit my double thick Xircom card. Not a deal-breaker, but should be noted. Amazon's product descriptions are a bit skimpy where it counts sometimes . . . YMMVBottom line: A solid inexpensive solution to offer a second life to your extra PCMCIA cards."
5,Attache Rummikub Game!!!!!,This is the greatest take along game!!!! I can take it anywhere. Everyone of any age will love it!! We play it for hours!!! I HIGHLY recommend this game!!!!
3,"Tea: I'll take just a half cup, I think. Thanks...","Overall it's not a bad little B class movie from the 1990's. This is the first time it's been released to the public in the U.S.It's a spy thriller movie that was shot in beautiful Cozumel, Mexico. Pretty good acting, with a veteran like David Naughton (from Werewolf in London fame), a few sex scenes, some hot bodies, some great action scenes, and even a few explosions. The footage isn't knock-out, but it's okay. And the story while it won't win any awards, it will keep the action moving along.If you only collect and watch A class movies, this one probably won't fit your standard. However, if you like the B movies, and are amused by their quirks and cheeky story lines and dialogue, you might check this little movie out."
1,*Pale* imitation,"Johnny Depp isn't Barnabas & Ben Cross isn't Barnabas. Many fans of this will argue it had been short-lived due to coverage of the gulf war or something. But no, it was obviously cancelled because the essence of Dark Shadows (the original) couldn't be recaptured & as such, ratings were considerably low. This was 12 episodes & 12 episodes too long. You don't monkey around with success. What was Dan Curtis thinking? I strongly recommend the original."
2,Greensberg's guides,bought 3 just like the others very good very good assistance to understand old items
3,Two faulty units,"I would have given this unit a ""1"", but I believe this unit will work ok. However the two cables I received were faulty. Not a good start. They would work as long as I tweaked the wire at the base of the magnet portion. Otherwise it didn't work. I am trying a third one soon, wish me luck..."
5,good,"not many knew of the band til misfits caught on to them. the few that did would already know that this album was already released and only now is offically distributed in the US with a new dvd. this album is good for a new fan. it has re-recorded material from the bands past and some for the best and few aren't as good as the originals. the dvd that comes with it is also worth the money, the studio look on the title track is somewhat humurous because it shows them [messing] up. the video for the song is interesting but the picture quality isn't that good, but thats no their fault...it's japan for exporting all the good quality cameras. in the end, worth the money if you have any interest in the asian fits"
5,And the Glory of the Lord shall be revealed!!!!,"This project is anointed! You can feel the Glory of the Lord all over it. It also packs enough star-power for anyone who listens to Chrisian-Gospel music could ever want or need. I pray that this project will be re-issued and that a new tour will happen. (I also pray that they learn from the mistakes of the doomed tour and take off the tarnish and let the wool be whitened as snow instead of as red as scarlet.) The Lord deserves all the praise, glory, and majesty for a projcect like this. I listen to it all year round. (I have the tape) I love it. My favorites are the Overture, Thou that tellest Good tidings to Zion, For Unto Us A Child is Born, Glory to God In the Hightest, I Know that My Redeemer Liveth, Lift Up Your Heads O Ye Gates, The Trumpets Will Sound and The Hallelujah Chorus. If it is at all possible to get a copy of this project--Get it!!!"
1,Think about it,"Do you rememeber the episode of the Ashlee Simpson Show that she dedicated to showing us how hard it is to write a book? No? That's because she did not write this book!! She can hardly read. Do you think she really wrote a book?Wake up America! Hopefully she will just go away, and maybe show up a few years later on The Surreal Life with Paris Hilton, K-Fed Spears, and Jude Law."
1,Amen to Egg Plant,He got it on the money when he said people are rebelling against reality show like Americas worst singer(American Idol)and Paris Hilton. This CD is also garbage. At least she is very very very very good looking which is really cool.
2,Not a great shoe for motion control,Part of the shoe lace wholes in( lacing them up) were weak and didn't hold after using them for a month.
2,not up to snuff !,I purchased this item and I must say I am not satisfied. The right foot fits well but the left does not and I experience pain when I start and finish my exercises.
1,I could of been doing something else,"Seeing as I watched the first ""Finding Me"", I only thought it appropriate to watch the sequel. However, what I was not expecting is acting that was even worse than the first movie. The dialouge was not believeable, the scenarios that the characters were put in were ridiculous, and the movie all around was not cohesive. There were WAY too many story lines going on and once, and when they all came to a head nothing made sense. ""Finding Me: Truth"" did have great potential. The issue that were bought up in the film were valid, but the execution was horrid. I really could have spent that hour and some change doing ANYTHING else."
2,This particular CD,This one we got the last song on the CD doesn't play right. Not worth the trouble of sending back in and going through the mail process.
5,Anthology...,"I already own the ""Best of Aurra"" import disc (Paid $26/US) to get it. I enjoy it very much. This anthology, however is a better value for the money! Salsoul Records comes through once again with a 2-Disc set (the cover is different than shown, by the way). I paid $15/US for it.Standout songs: Make up your mind, Are you single? (The BEST song in my opinion! Also, there is an informatinal error on the back of the disc. Are you single? is listed at 4:33. It's actually the 6:33 extended version!!), In the Groove, Keep On Doin' it and Patience. An excellent value for the money, $15/US well spent! Five stars!!"
4,Well Written and Aptly Titled,"This is a book for southern women who miss the south, and for those of us not from the south, but who moved there and were embraced by southern women. This book is an exclamation of our lives. We have a number of people to wonder about...the families we were born into and the ones we married into; the family member that we didn't choose, but have to live with; the friends that have brought us to a new understanding of family.Braselton's book is well written and aptly titled."
3,Aptly Titled!,"I had real trouble with this book, unable to commit to any of it until way past the middle of it. I kept saying to myself that I was wasting time reading about these thoroughly uninteresting people and their boring lives, but I'm stuck with a broken leg with plenty of time to waste, so I persisted and it got a lot better later on, after Jessie goes back to her home and family in the deep South. I kept admiring the author's wonderful writing gift, but wishing she'd apply it to a more interesting story and plot, until I discovered that all her characters lead totally uninteresting, pitiful lives, and that's what she's writing about, at length and ad nauseatum, through Jessie's eyes! The heroine, despite all her efforts to escape her misery, is a prisoner like all the others, a victim who tries unsuccessfully to wake up from a false sense of wellbeing."
4,Interesting fantasy set in Kabbalistic realm.,"A dramatic escape from trite ""sword & sorcery"" Lilith is an engaging, well-defined story of reincarnation, powerful magicks, and the battle between ""good"" and ""evil.""The author's command of the Kabbalistic imagery the story evokes demonstrates his fantastic research for the novel. This is no slapped together story.Characterization is solid, and character interaction is realistic. The plot develops nicely, with requisite twists and turns (the lead antagonist dies and comes back 1,000 years later).In all a fun read; you'll be sure to keep an eye out for the sequels."
2,it does the job but only just,The manufacturers of this laptop accessory have forgotten to make a few holes in the foam. Now the heat from your computer can go nowhere other than the laptop stand. And as it is a type of plastic is starts to smell after using it for a longer time. So it is certainly not a a laptop cooler.Also i would have appreciated it when the bottom material would have been able to mould more around your legs. Now it is just something hard on top of your legs that is quite unstable. Finally i noticed that my computer tends to slide from time to time.So handy thing if you want to us it occasionally but not something for when oyu liek to work in the conservatory for a few hours.
1,THUMBS WAY DOWN,"This book was really nothing special. It was so predictable the title of the book should've been,""Some Young Children Get Lost in a Storm and are Saved"". This book had no excitement and i don't recomend this book to anybody."
3,More than just facts,"This book was recommended by a freind and I found it to be an engaing and exciting read. The facts surrounding the events are presneted in somewhat of a US-biased slant. After all CIA admitted having overthrown Mosadeq, so what's new is to make it look as good as it can be! US is discussed as having been pursuaded and even pressured by the British to run the operation to overthrow a popularly elected democratic regime. We find ourselves in an era after the WWII and in the thick of establishing who is the dominant world power. Perhaps the US had some more sophisticated motive than being a servant of Churchil's will.Regardless, there is plenty for the reader to chew on and contemplate. What is undisputed is the US/British role in destroying democracy in Iran and setting up the stage for the religious klan to destroy its national identity and set-up a long term servitude of this nation."
2,A failure and a cynical book,"This book is written thru a leftist prespective and is full of resentment for the late Shah of Iran and the United States of America. The author thinks the entire terrorism thing is a result of 1953 coup against PM Mossadeq but the truth to the matter is that the hatred for the west existed hundreds of years before the events of 1953 or even 1979 for that matter. Radical Islamic terrorists hated the western way of life way before the 1953 coup. And the author fails to grab this fact. Yes, the coup was a mistake but when we put it in Iranian historical context it was a wise and important decision. Shah put PM Mossadeq in power in 1951 and when he asked Mossadeq to resign, he resisted and it resulted in the ugly events of 1953. Had Mossadeq resigned, there wouldn't be any coup and there would not be any problem at all."
4,Good synopsis of the 20th century,"Kinzer's work reads well and presents good scholarship on the historical background behind the current Iranian regime. It puts in light the actions of the great powers in nations after World War One and exposes the ""meddling"" of nation / companies and their arrogance in dealing with citizens of a nation. While you will not find the ""roots"" of middle eastern terrorism in this book, you will discover the origins of our present animosity with Iran.The political bravery of Mohammed Mosedegh is particularly moving as are the various machiniations of the political parties within Iran. The present dominance fo the mullahs may not be long for this world if (as of Spring 2007) their economy continues to sputter. Pick up this book as a great adjunct to Persian history."
5,Interesting and fun read,"I bought this book because I was interested getting more perspective on the current Iranian crisis. I must confess being completely ignorant of Middle East history prior to reading this. This was a very enlightening book, written in a way that is almost like reading a novel. I read it in 2 days.As an American, this book helps me to understand why many in the Middle East hold us in such poor esteem, and how we ourselves have contributed to this sorry state of affairs.This book should be suggested reading in high school or college history classes. It has certainly made me want to learn more about Iran and about the Middle East in general."
1,Same old Song,This book is another meant to bash the former monarchy and nothing more. History-wise it is on the lame side on many issues too long to go into. An unbaised look at this whole era can be found in THE SHAH'S LAST RIDE.
3,A Bargain with a Catch,"These kinds of albums always mystify me. They're put out there for the mass-market audience, cheaply priced to attract the average K-Mart shopper. But the music, as great at it is, is likely to be fully appreciated only by the Ellington specialist and aficionado, since it is from the early 40's and is likely to be the least accessible Ellington to neophyte ears. And to compound the problem, there's not a single program note provided for any of the songs, so even a die-hard Ellington fan is likely to be frustrated (can it be so much added expense for the producer to provide dates, names of musicians, etc?). In any case, the album, especially in the dirt-cheap cassette version, is a golden find for the impoverished Ellington scholar who knows the history behind the recordings and who had come to the local K-Mart to pick up some motor oil."
4,"Weird, Ridiculous, Sleazy Fun!","This is a wonderful, love it or hate it collection of Bukowski's weird, ridiculous, and sleazy short stories, bizarre little slices of life from the mean streets and the underground. Sure, there are a few headscratchers and stinkers tossed in (including one really bizarre supernatural witchcraft tale that feels out of place), but overall, I'd say 85% of the stories are fun reads.Another great collection of Buk's short fiction isThe Most Beautiful Woman in Town, with about 85% awesome stories in it, too. Buk's other shorts anthology,Tales of Ordinary Madness, is pretty terrible by comparison, with only a few gems, and less than half the stories being even halfway decent (warning: the rest are crap).Newcomers to Buk would be better off beginning with one of his novels:Ham on Rye: A Novel(his very best),post office: A Novel,Factotum tie-in, andWomen: A Novel."
1,dont buy this swing!!!!,"this is the worst swing ever, i got it from my baby shower not th swing i was asking for but it would work i thought. my daughter at a month and a half could pull the toy bar off and would get hit in the head by the hard toys so i had to take ir away. then at two wnd a half months and 11lbs she rolled her head to th side where idint notice untill after it happened but there are two plastic bolt covers and she wacked her head on it and got a big bruse and mark....i called fisher price and i have to send some pieces into them but we are getting a full refund.....so i wouldnt recomend this swing to anyone who dosnt want your child getting wacked in the head or hurting themselves !!!"
3,Careful.... its not a backpack!,"I bought this thinking it would be a fun backpack for my preschooler who loves Minnie. While it is good quailty and very cute the only part that opens for storage is a tiny backpack that Minnie wears. It's not big enough for more than a small snack bag. She still loves it and maybe I missed reading the details of this before I bought it, but I think the name of the product is misleading."
3,Great if you like Football.,I thought this was a good book. Because it was about football. It was'ent just one team it has different players and some of the best players from the 80's to the 90's. Some players are still playing till this day.Thats what this books about good professional players ;about their good days and their bad days.
5,Desperate to find this book!,I read this book when I was 12 and loved it. I have always remembered it...
1,Model turns TV Presenter turns Singer,"This is absolutely one of the most untalented persons worldwide. Haifa is apparently a babe, nonetheless, that's all she is. There is definitely no reason whatsoever to buy this CD or even listen to her songs on the radio."
4,great outdoor no-film camera,"This camera is pretty cool for outdoor quick shoots that you want to take but dont want to waste film on. Also if there is something you want to shoot and go direct to computer avoiding the conversion time to mpeg4 ! You can get over 40 minutes of high quality mp4 video on a 1gb sd card , 60 min if you lower raise the compression.Creates an mp4 , so it plays straight from computer no need to convert anything! what a time saver. Again , its an outdoor camera.... in low light there is too much digital noise... but the outdoor is great and the sound is awesome!Great camera for the price ! Its not a DV replacement but a supplement for quick shoots or web email."
4,Works good,"This product worked great, I just wish it came with a 5 volt power supply. hence the 4 star rating."
4,"Beautiful, but flawed","This is a BEAUTIFUL book, and well-worth the relatively low Amazon price. However, there are some flaws in it, which might make its usefulness a tad questionable to serious students of Paleo-Indian artifact values and identities. Several pictures are incorrectly ID'ed (see page 6 and 7...the same picture is used for a fluted point and a clovis point. The same thing happens on page 97. This is probably the result of carelessness on the part of the type/image setter, not the author, but it does make one wonder. The images are spectacular (and I'd give my eye-teeth to find any ONE of them), so ignore my carping and purchase this book. It is huge and loaded with full-color photos of points and tools that will make your mouth water. I want to go to Ohio and hunt for artifacts!"
4,"For a dub, I'm pleasantly surprised","Even though it seems to start slow, this is a wonderful story that just gets better and better as it goes along. The plot leads through a seemingly twisted path, with an ending that you never see coming.I watched the Japanese episodes of Utawarerumono as they came out on TV and, I must say, I was cringing with the thought of how they would dub this series.When I received the first disk, I was pleasantly surprised. Hakuoro's (shortened to Hakuro for the dub) voice could be a bit deeper to fit the character but otherwise it's alright. Oboro, Benawi, Nuwangi, Yuzuha, and the archer twins are nailed dead on for personalities and voices.The translation is also pretty close to the original Japanese.Overall, this is a dub that I can truly say I am happy with, having seen both versions."
1,Lyon by Washburn LAMP3 Micro Amplifier,I purchased one of the Lyon Micro Ampifier. And after about 3 months the unit started humming when any of my guitars are plugged into it. And humming to the point were you could not use it. And became very noticeable on quite passages I played on my guitar and I was always accompanied by a constant hum. This is very annoying and I have stopped using it. Do not buy.
4,An enlightened though slightly ascetic effort from the author,I have been reading the I Ching for some years and I very much appreciate this author's insight into all the rationale behind this sage and ancient piece of work.
3,3 out of 5,"1 give this mat 3 out of 5 stars ... Though other mats claim to have a 1"" grid, they often come with smaller increments as well; this mat does not. The photo did not provide a close-up close enough for my proper examination. The mat arrived in a giant box which I was thrilled about, but the mat was probably damaged before or while placing it into the box. I am keeping the mat only because I want to protect my glass top desk from crafting (I don't care if it gets stained). I will also be using this mat to convert my wood mounted rubber stamps to a cling mount system, so I don't want my glass desk getting cut or scratched either with a rotary blade, craft knife nor a hot knife. I will upload a photo of the damaged mat. It appears to be minor damage, but when you pay full price for something, you expected it to be undamaged. The odor is not that bad and should dissipate in several days. In a few months or so, I will be updating my review to reflect it's performance."
2,This police station falls apart,"I bought this train building for my grandson for Christmas to add to his train lay-out. If it would stay together it would be ok, but it falls apart easily becuase the pieces do not fit tightly into each other. It seems to be a problem in the manufacturing of the plastic pieces. My son (grandson's dad) has to constantly put the building together even though it's just sitting on the train board not being played with. That's annoying and disappointing."
3,noli me tangere,"the translation of the two novels by charles derbyshire is a lot better to me than this one, no offense to this author intended. so is his translation of Rizal's ""mi ultimo adios"". I would appreciate it very much if somebody can steer me to copies of these again. Thanks."
3,Tassel Making by Anna Crutchley,As a beginner I found this book VERY confusing. The instructions are not very detailed and key points are left out. I think even an experienced tassel maker would find the instructions/directions confusing at times. Name brand threads / supplies are given and hard to find. Substitute or more detailed supply list would have been nice. The photos and examples are wonderful though! It is worth buying just for the inspiration. Unfortunately I now have to buy a new book to give me the beginning guides that I need!
5,ONE OF THE BEST,"I have seen and used as a reference other ""care plan"" books and most of the can't compare to this one. I love it and use if frequently. I write the entire care plan process for all MDS's.thanx to the author. connie"
1,The Last Episode DOESN'T PLAY?!!?!?!,"WHAT IN THE WORLD IS BANDAI THINKING?!?! All the episodes play, EXCEPT THE LAST ONE, and there is ABSOLUTELY NO WAY OF REACHING ANY SEGMENT OF THE EPISODE!!!!"
2,Something fishy here,"There is something very fishy going on here. As an earlier reviewer noted, the series doesn't seem to be over at volume 12... and that's because it isn't! Back when Gundam Seed Destiny was showing on Japanese TV, I was able to get *ahem* Chinese versions from Hong Kong, and there ARE 13 volumes in total. This English dubbed version ends at Volume 12 with episode 46, but my Chinese version runs for 50 episodes. What gives here?"
1,Rather frustrated,"I have sort of been looking forward to the conclusion of this series, however I can't watch it due to faulty DVD's. I just received my replacement from Amazon and it is the same problem. ""The media you have inserted is not DVD encoded"" I have popped this into HDDVD player, 3 standard def DVD players and 2 Mac optical drives and get the same thing every time or just have the disc spit back out. Save your money until this problem gets fixed."
4,1988 wasn't so dead afterall,"This 1988 trio outing by Mal Waldron for the Timeless label revisits, as the title suggests, selections that have come to be associated with Billie Holiday (or, Lady Day). Waldron paces himself like the schooled and comfortable cat that he was, his playing somewhat serious and sad. Waldron is, of course, the standout on this album. Just kick off your shoes and lay back into your couch--this one is bound to help you unwind. (Essential)Mal Waldron (piano)Paul Cardosa (bass)John Betsch (drums)"
2,Flashback To The High School Girl's Bathroom,"I got this as a gift. Reading it was like being zapped back to high school, in the girl's bathroom, where that one click of know-it-all girls were always busy gossiping and deciding how everyone else should behave and what was and wasn't cool. The basic message back then, as with this book, is you are either with us or against us. Conform to what we think women should be. Not a good message for girls or women and certainly won't help you with dating. If you want good advice that doesn't tell you how to be and will work, I suggestGod Is a Woman: Dating DisastersandA Practical Handbook for the Boyfriend: For Every Guy Who Wants to Be One/For Every Girl Who Wants to Build One, which are both very good. I also heardThe Manual: A True Bad Boy Explains How Men Think, Date, and Mate--and What Women Can Do to Come Out on Topis good and just picked up a copy of that."
3,Promenade All,This book was interesting from a historical point of view. It is set in Canada in a farming and trapping community. The characterization of the main characters was mediocre and the story was just not that exciting or entertaining. I keep buying her books trying to find another to match the quality of Kirsty but that has not happened yet. This book is OK but I would not read again.
4,Good season.,"My least favorite season of the series, but I still enjoyed it quite a bit. Adrianna and Naomi really stole the show during this season. Definitely worth a look and I'm looking forward to season five!"
2,Expected Much Better,"The plot is okay it develops well and moves along but it is predictable. The characters are very poorly drawn -- Southern caricatures with terrible names (Rowell, Cuddy,etc., c'mon). Justin, the thoroughly unlikeable hero is arrogant sees faults in everyone but himself and blames others for all his faults, is so inconsistently drawn you really can't figure him out and the villains aren't even worth getting upset about. The dialogue is really stilted, Cuddy calling Justin ""General Lee"" passes for witty repartee. And the ""love"" interests -- are just not believable The men are two dimensional, the women are truly uni-dimensional how could the men be interested and how could the women be interested in the men.From the reviews I read before I read the book, I expected much better. This was a major disappointment."
1,Please don't let that flying manikin bite me......awwwwh,"The master vampire in this movie looks exactly like a burnt manikin dummy being pulled through the air by a wire. The special effects in this movie is very cheesey. The acting is also bad. The actors hardly have a script, but I guess that they didn't need one since they spend 90% of the movie fighting each other.If you want to watch a good Vampire martial arts movie, than I sugest that you get the original Blade, or From Dust till Dawn part 1."
1,DANGEROUS Design Flaw Causes Leaks,"This tea maker worked well for us, UNTIL it developed 6 symmetrical sliver/chips at the edges of the water chamber, one at each corner and one in the middle of each side. The pot began to leak when sliver 4 fell off. DANGEROUS DESIGN FLAW, the water leaks near the electric contacts. I wrote the company and await a response. Will update.4/29/2010 Zarafina replied promptly to my email about the leak. They noted that the unit was out of warranty, but sent me a replacement unit. (I complained of a design flaw rather than a manufacturing defect!) I appreciate their prompt reply. The new unit does not appear different, so I will wait to see how it holds up."
4,"Good tea, finicky hardware","I enjoy the tea this makes, both bagged and loose. It has all the settings you need to make most all tea.Soon after buying it however, it stopped dispensing tea. It would over heat and burn the tea every time, and never open up the dispenser. I sat on hold for an hour waiting for tech support before I gave up. However, I found out that unplugging it and plugging it back in after a few seconds made it start working again. It must run Windows. It started doing it again a few days later, and power cycling it did the trick again. So now every night I unplug it and haven't had trouble."
4,"Great, fun to use machine","I am new to tea, and mostly drink herbal teas (Love me my peppermint!), so I am no expert. This machine is quite the neat item. I am addicted to kitchen gadgets, and own an nespresso machine for espresso drinks, a Keurig machine for coffee, and now this machine for tea. It is a clean, quiet operating machine that is very well-designed. The packaging is fantastic and evokes a feeling of quality as soon as you open the box. I just wish the machine had a beeper when finished, as that would help as I probably won't stand there and watch it brew every time (Although I did the first time I brewed it, because I'm curious). I love the cups and teapot that are included, it's just an overall well-designed, solid feeling machine that brews a great tasting cup of tea (to me at least)"
2,Tea maker,"Bought this one a while ago in hope that someone has invented how to brew loose leaf tea in easy and convenient way.No, it has not been done just yet. Monies spent not wisely on this one... it's just sitting in my kitchen and rarely used, too much work with a few satisfactory results.Still brewing loose leaf old fashion way that proved to be the best -in tea pot!"
5,Tea lovers dream,"I also cannot recommend this highly enough for all tea drinkers. I drink white, green, oolong and black teas. I have always been frustrated by overbrewing tea and the resulting bitter taste. White tea is especially sensitive to overbrewing and should be steeped at lower temperatures. This machine takes all of the thinking and guesswork out of tea and leaves pure enjoyment. It arrives beautifully packaged and looks great on the kitchen counter. A lot of thought went into a beautiful, compact and simple design. Throw away the tea ball or strainers and get one of these, you'll be happy you did. I use mine several times a day to enjoy the relaxing and health benefits of tea."
3,Great Brew But Not Enough,I got this for Christmas and it works great. But if you drink lots of tea as we do this is not for you. It makes only two cups and refilling can get tedious which negates the fun of watching the Zarafina Suite do its magic. I suppose it will be great for special situations for two. But for everyday requirements we have gone back to brewing tea in a 10 cup coffee maker.
1,An unfortunate waste of money.,"Had this for a little over a year, and used it sporadically but was generally satisfied. Care was taken of the proper parts, but it stopped boiling water one morning.I called the customer support number (the call center involved obviously handles multiple products as I was greeted with a different company name before they corrected themselves) anyhow long story short they were next to useless as apparently it had just gone out of warranty - so they said I had to go to an authorized repair centre (ok, wasn't happy but still wanted this fixed)...however they don't have a repair center in the entire state! The recommendation was to take it to a general appliance repair center..?!? As if they'd know what to do with this.So for a product that only lasts for a year I can't say I'm impressed with the company or the value of the product. Shame."
5,"no problems, great movie","This movie is one of my favorite Robert Deniro roles. Scary for some, thrilling for others... Great dialogue. Sarcasm, intensity, and very well acted by everyone in it."
4,Scorsese's genre film,"Max Cady (Robert DeNiro), a violent criminal, stalks his former defense lawyer, Sam Bowden (Nick Nolte), who he blames for his fourteen year sentence for rape. He is not entirely wrong, since Bowden buried a report on the victim's promiscuity out of certainty that Cady was guilty. Nobody is entirely innocent in Martin Scorsese's remake of a film noir thriller from the 60s. This moral complexity and intense work from the talented cast, which includes Jessica Lange and Juliette Lewis, make for an involving suspense film. A major drawback, though, is Scorsese himself, who indulges in some jarringly self-conscious effects and choppy pacing. These flaws become less apparent as the film builds momentum toward its powerful climax. Strangely, this film from one of our most talented directors features the most egregious example of product placement I have ever seen. Joe Don Baker's bottle of Pepto Bismol is so prominent that it should have received fourth billing in the credits."
2,Mediocre Script,"Robert De Niro gives an exellent performance, everything else in the film is mediocre. The script is simply bland and lacking in talent.If you want to see Robert De Niro, rent Taxi Driver.If you want to see Jessica Lang, rent Tootsie.If you want to see Nick Nolte, rent Who'll Stop The Rain.I would suggest these films, and the original Cape Fear, instead of this poorly remade movie."
5,"A fun, humerous read.","This book is short and sweet. Ruth's writing style has a natural flow and she displays a keen sense of humor that kept me laughing throughout. If you are interested in an authentic account of the exchange student life, a quick and smooth read, or just a good laugh, this book comes highly recommended."
5,Awesome bouncer!,"My wife and I have tried several big-name bouncy seats out, and this Boppy is absolutely the best. Very spacious, durable, comfy, and attractive. My little Mr. Jewell just loves it. My only complaint concerns the vibration feature, and it is a very minor complaint. It's easy to forget that you have it set to vibrate, and it has no automatic shutoff, so if you leave it on, your batteries are shot, pal. Otherwise, I have to say that this seat kicks the [...] of seats costing five times as much. Take it from me--you couldn't find a better bouncy for the buck!"
3,Mostly just a good infant seat,"I am not sure what I was expecting, but this is just an ok product to me. So many of my friends had said their kids loved the swing, or loved the bouncy seat. This is a nice quality bouncer, nice plush fabric, attractive. But my daughter was not particularly excited about the toys, vibration or music. So it is pretty much just a nice infant seat. Nothing too exciting, I think maybe a cheaper one would have been just as good, it's something we haven't used as much as I thought we might."
3,"Comfortable, but bad for baby's spine","Our newborn loved the seat, probably feeling snug and being reminded of life in the womb. However, it is important to note that the baby's spine and neck are cramped in this seat and given no room to grow, Especially when a baby is growing so much, we really wanted to avoid that so we stopped using the seat."
5,Must have!,"These Boppy chairs are excellent. I have twins and always need a place to ""sit"" the baby while I tend to baby ""B"" or bottles or anything else. The vibrating mechanism I have found key to pacifying the babies and often will pull it off and place it on the crib next to the baby so they can sleep better. I highly recommend these chairs."
1,Not entirely safe,"The tubing that forms the base of the bouncer fits into plastic oval mounts and are secured by metal pins. The pins, made out of cheap stamped metal, are folded to create a spring. The problem is that these pins break very easily along the crease where they are folded, and once they break, the base can collapse. One day while my two month old son was in the bouncer, one of the tubes slipped out of the mount (two pins were broken) and the bouncer lurched forward. Luckily I was close by and held on to the seat, preventing my son from falling out. The manual said to call Kids II, the maker of the chair, for customer service. I called, left a message and received no reply. I called Boppy's customer service several times and each time left a message and, again, no reply. I emailed customer service at Boppy and once again received no response."
2,difficult to use,"The product is difficult to use, and it does not work effectively. It is too heavy to hold for a long period of time. It is basically useless on tough jobs."
3,Not a bad product,"The auger worked fine. The end of it is a little larger than it needs to be, but it worked fairly well."
3,Drain Cleaning,"Works well on sinks, but not on larger plumbing job. When I attempted to learn the drain from the outside of the home, it twisted quite badly and bent."
4,Best Wu-Tang CD I heard in a *while*,"If your looking for some fresh Wu, or just some nice New York rap, this is the one. Got it all. Real nice. It's got a nice variety of emcees on it. Queens Day is.....wooooh."
5,Feeling diz...,"Yeah math comes correct with his album mathematics's "" love hell right"" a must for any hip-hop head. F*ck dat commercial garbage."
4,Not a great selection,"This book serves its purpose well, but it doesn't give specific places where a person could work and use his unique talent. I used Vaultreports.com to find companies that would be a good fit for a person like me."
4,Pleased with the buy,The book was exactly what i was looking for and it shipped and arrived in a timely manner. Very Pleased with this purchased.
4,almost there,"when I heard this album before purchasing it back in 2002 I breathed a sigh of relief that she had created beautiful ballads with nice melodies once again. I was tired of the bland, overproduced hip hop collaborations. Other than songs like Boy, You Got Me, Irrestible, Through the Rain remix, the rest of the album was pretty enjoyable, but the hip hop tracks I mentioned just didn't fit on the album at all. I wish those were stuck on the glitter CD and the pretty ballads from glitter which were the onlyg ood part of that album should have been on charmbracelet."
4,Mariahs Comeback,"I think Mariah did a very good job on this C.D after all she's been through. She has really proven herself as an artist, by showing people that no matter how hard you fall you always need to get back up and show people what your made of. I also see the story behind the C.D. So I believe this C.D is one of her top ones."
5,"Best R&B album of 2002 ""Charmbracelet""","Mariahs latest album charmbracelet is agreat album i recomend it to nething w/ears.From the ballads to the hip hop kuts its anall around master piece. She sounds like shesreinventing her voice but its classy. toanyone who plans on cd shoppin make sure thisis on ur list, i think its her best album...so far..."
2,Why is she back?,She should go back to 1997 when she was actually good. This CD is a waste of money and time. Anyone want to buy my copy?
1,Really BORING album.,"Sorry but Mariah needs give up her low whisper singing and go back to her powerhouse ballads, THROUGH THE RAIN is a good song but the rest of the album is boring."
4,WELCOME BACK MARIAH!!!!,"I have to believe that this is Mariah's best CD! I have and love all of her CD's but the songs on this is all around terrific. The songs ""Lullaby"" is such a perfect groove song..totally different for Mariah, especially the jazzy uptempo ""Subtle Invitation"" i was blown away by this song, I couldnt believe Mariah created this. Other songs like ""Through the Rain, and ""I only wanted"" is what everyone expects and loves about Mariah's ballads. The song ""The One"" is just great, the club or dance remix would probably be hot. Overall, everyone who slammed and kicked her Glitter CD, needs to hear this because Mariah is glittering all over this CD. I am very happy that she put everything aside and created this masterful CD. Mariah is truly here to stay!!!!!!"
4,Almost there,"Mariah Carey fans rejoice! She's back and almost in tip top form. This is a nice CD but truthfully only two songs on it have a shot at serious radio play. Hopefully someone is working on the remixes right now. There is too much whispering and holding back on the album, Mariah only cuts loose with that incredible range on two songs. I wanted yell ""Sing Mariah!"" I wish she'd leave the moaning and almost talking to less talented singers who have do that to sell a song. The bottom line with Charmbracelet is it's a tentative, careful release that sounds like she's not quite sure of herself yet. I'm not giving up on Ms. Carrey though. Perhaps with the success of this CD she'll be her old self again on the next album."
4,"Glitter and Charms Mariah makes it ""Through The Rain""","Mariah writes her charm story, Charmbracelet with hard work and dedication she makes it through the rain. Her songs will charm their way into your heart. As you listen to her cd you will understand all that Mariah has being through these past years. All that Mariah believes in is love, love that she breathes, love that she bleeds, love that she inhales and love that she has lost, but in the end Mariah finds her saving grace. This cd is really inspiring and this cd shows people that you should never give up no mattter how hard ppeople close the doors. Go out and buy the cd Mariah's voice is incredible."
4,Good Times,"Songs reminsicent of 90s Mariah, Hero-style...Through the Rain gets some a nice vocal treatment in the remix with Kelly Price and Joe; a remix of Camron's big summer hit 'Oh Boy' on Boy (I Need You); good soulful hip hop fun on You Got Me ft. Jay-Z, and slew of old school flava revisiting Dr Dre's 'Nuthin But a G Thang' on her song 'You Had Your Chance' suprisingly, produced by Jermaine Dupri (I guess this is a peaceful sign between the two?) Otherwise a nice collection of Old School Hero-Mariah (before Tommy Mottola's plot to destroy her career) and Hip Hop/R&B Mariah. GOOD TIMES~"
2,"""You're no superhero...""","Charmbracelet by Mariah Carey is anything but a treasure. This was the album after her so-called breakdown and the music here is mostly filler, the songs are just messy and uninspiring. I used to love Mariah's albums but this one is her second worst after the horrific Rainbow. The only song with spunk and a sense of humor is the Eminem diss track, Clown. Bringin' on the Heartache is a so-so cover and Through the Rain is a complete snooze fest. I hate her r & b style songs, wish she would go back to her pop roots, this is one album to dispose of."
3,Poor Mariah...,"After her overly publicized ""break-down,"" it would have been nice to see Mariah come back with Diva style and blow us away with a spectacular CD.Unfortunately, ""Charmbracelet"" is less than stunning. It lacks any difinitive beat or tune, and Mariah's light, breathy vocals leave the listener yearning for more substance.Other Mariah Carey CD's, like her #1's, are classics, and really show off her talent. This just isn't one of them."
2,"should have been called ""hospital bracelet""","cause she was still going through mental issues when this album came out, as nice as the ballads are."
5,MARIAH is back and at her best,"Not knowing what I was in store for was exciting when I picked up my copy(s) of Charmbracelet! I couldn't wait for each song to be over (so I could get to the next #1), but at the same time I wanted the songs to be longer. Each song tells an amazing story about love, happiness, and pain. Each song is amazingly written and sung. Mariah hasn't skipped a beat since her first album back in 1990. She is always trying new things and conquering them with victories(15 NUMBER 1 HITS). This is one of Ms. Carey's greatest materpieces!!!"
1,Celine Is Still Better,"I don't like this CD. Look, she is not a DIVA anymore, this CD is WASTE!!! HATE MARIAH, SHE IS FAT, BAD, NOBODY'S LIKE HER!!! She Is FLIRT!!! We NEED CELINE DION!!!! BLAH TOO!!!! HATE This CD...She Is Fat, Fat, Fat............"
2,Terrible comeback album,"As a BIG Mariah fan, this album was a hug disappointment. C'mon stop singing with those annoying nasal sounding noises! Please save it for background vocals. I am so sick of hearing her switch voices in the lead vocals of every song on this album.You should buy this album because:1) You're a fan trying to support her through a tough time2) You like listening to moaning and groaning noises"
5,"So Kewl!! May 26, 2003","This album is awesome! It is one of the best! Maraiah has an awesome voice and someday i wish to be like her! you see i am 13 and I have a big future ahead of me but Mariah influences me to be like her! ""through the rain"" is my favorite song and i hope she keeps on singing! All of her songs are so kewl and i don't know what that guy at thew bottom was talking about... she definatley does not need an oxygen mask! he is just jellous! GET OVER IT!Luv this album"
4,Where do you go after perfection?,"After listening to ""Through the Rain"" and ""My Saving Grace"", I missed Mariah Carey's earlier works. Those two songs reminded me of why I fell in love with Ms. Carey. They were both touching and stirring songs but they reminded me of her more emotionally charged works, such as, her poignant ""Anytime You Need A Friend"" or her affecting ""Vision of Love"". Ms. Carey's voice is in no doubt a polished instrument since her earliest works. However, few of the songs in the album match the high quality of her voice. I suppose Charmbraclet like her other recent works are the products of an artist figuring out where to go after perfection."
3,Modest come back.,"I never thought that her previous album ""Glitter"" was a mess, it was maybe in the commercial way but the songs were good, not her best, but they were ok.I also think that singers when sell extremely good for some many years, arrives the time when the selling is going to be smaller and that happened with singers like Micahel Jackson or Whitney Houston, so Mariah had her time in the 90's, she's a great singer, her voice is unique but I find very difficult that she'll recover her past status.I found ""Charmbracelet"" with good work and dedication but I can't compare it with albums like ""Butterfly"" or ""Emotions"".The first single ""through the rain"" which was a modest hit (it peaked at #83) is very good, actually the remix version is better.There are very good songs in this album like ""The one"", ""Yours"" and ""Irresistible""."
2,Not the best Mariah,This cd is not the best of Mariah Carey. She has such a beautiful voice and she doesn't use the strengh in her voice very much on this album. With the exception of My saving Grace the rest of the cd is pretty hum drum. Burn a copy don't waste your money. I bought one just because I am fan. BUt I should have had one burned and not bought it. Hopefully Mariah's next cd will be more powerful.
4,Pretty good,"I really like this CD. i can't say every song is so awesome. But there are about 5 to 6 really classic and great songs, the rest are not too bad, not too good either."
3,MAYBE NEXT TIME,Well.....being a huge Mariah Carey Fan....I was strangly dissapointed in this album....None Of The songs really capture the imagination with a hook that won't let go....Like previous albums....Mariah Carey Needs to go back to her more soulful Roots like in the first 2 albums (Mariah Carey & Emotions)...And is it just me or does no one else realize the quality of her vocals has gone way down....She has such a powerful voice and it is not used on this album or the last...or the one before it....she can sing....she just needs to!!!!!!!
1,"As Whack as J-Lo's ""This Is Me... Then""","There is not much to say about this album, except that this is no selftitled ""Mariah Carey"", ""Emotions"", ""Music Box"" or ""Daydream""! J-Lo's cd is even slighty better than this! Get Kelly Price-""Soul of a Woman"", Keisha Jackson-""Keisha"", Nayobe-""Promise Me"" & ""Please Don't Go"", Kim Wilde-""Close"" and Thelma Houston-""Throw You Down"" instead of this poor cd!"
1,WHAT!?,"Mariah has a great voice. I'll give you that. This was in the middle of her serious break-down and I understand what she was going through. She tells us fans how she is meant to feel, and she gets the point accross, but is it meant to be heartfelt, emotional and sympathetic? On my dead body. If you want a personal effort, turn to Madonna's Like A Prayer or Lindsay Lohan's A Little More Personal (RAW) (seriously, it's good!!)."
2,hmmm......,i think mariah had some good songs on this cd but nothing like the outstanding recovery album we were all expecting..her backups sing too much and her airy breathy voice gets very annoying. She does not belt out the notes we know she can and does not utilize her talent. She needs to not be so produced. Go BACK TO UR ROOTS mariah and just sing! not so much fluff around ur voice..
2,Too difficult to play,Many people like Wii because it is easy to play.This game is too difficult to control. I personally cannot enjoy this title.Maybe some power users like it; but I don't.
2,Hard to control,"The game is fun, but very hard to contol and see what the transformer is doing. My kids cant play the game very well."
1,"Horrible game, no fun for my son","My son is a HUGE transformers fan-loves anything that has to do with the brand, so I thought this was a no-brainer.He was very excited to get it, but after playing it once he never went back to it, much to my dismay.His complaint was the camera angle and how hard it was to navigate.He has a DS transformer game which he plays night and day.Too bad activision dropped the ball on this game."
2,what a waste of money,"I loved the movie so what a disapointment the game was. Maybe I am just not smart enough to play, but between the dificult controls and the camera my advice would be to buy something else."
3,Coulda been better!,"This game is fun, and I really like that you get to transform whenever you want, however the camera when you are a robot is controlled by where you are pointing the Wii remote and is automatically behind the car when you are a car. So every time I switch over to the robot, to fight, the camera goes all the way to the ground and I'm looking up at Bumblebee's butt and then I get stomped by the Decepticon I'm trying to fight. Then its really hard to get the camera in the right place and keep it there. This game could have been a lot better if they had made the camera be automatically behind you when your're a robot. I like that you can pick up everything and anything and chuck it around, very cool!"
2,Disappointing,"I read Ron Christie's new book as I was looking to find some insight into how the Bush White House works. Having seen the author on a number of tv programs he comes across as earnest, forthright and dedicated to the conservative cause. Unfortunately, he hasn't been in the top echelon of decision-making to warrant a good book. It's too low-level.I wish Mr. Christie well.....there's nothing more in his book that we already know, would care to know or will find out sooner or later."
2,a little switcharoo,"Pelican would include an order form inside of new Pelican Cases for silica gel and for Pelilocks with the same catalogue number of 1506TSA. I bought a number of the locks which were black, 4 combo locks with a solid hasp...they have substituted these cable 3 combo locks which are much easier for someone to access. The cables can be easily cut with a leatherman or wire cutters and a 3 digit combo is significantly less effective than the prior 4 digit. Better off buying a 4 digit lock but make sure the hasp is long enough if you are buying for a pelican case... the original 1506TSA locks Pelican sold were perfect.....no wonder they stopped selling them."
1,Terrible Lock,"I travel with expensive camera equipment and I use only Pelican hard cases.Poor protection: when you use this lock on any Pelican hard case you can still open the case about an inch and a half. This is due to the excessively long cable hasp. The opening is just enough to provide a look inside the case and to snag any small item that can be easily shaken from the inside compartment.Poor design setting function: A poorly designed aspect of this lock is the positioning of the setting button. You have to depress the setting button on the side of the case with a paper clip or pen point, then keep the setting button depressed while rotating the dials to your new combination. The positioning is all wrong and it took me at least 5 minutes to set two locks.Does not provide adequate security for Pelican hard cases. Poorly designed setting functions."
5,A wonderful unit,I researched what was the best 5 disc changer and this has all the needed features. Continues to get high marks from various consumer groups. Sometimes I have trouble with the automatic play the next dics but I think that is due to a setting I have incorrect. This is the second one I have purchased. First one the power switch is bad we think and it was less money to purchase new than fix. Will probably fix first on the cheap and give to a friend. Then if second one does same thing we know how to fix it.Overall a great player
2,Worked fine for 9 months...,This DVD player worked just fine for around 9 months and now something has gone wrong with the processor- I no longer get any output to the subwoofer channel from either the Digital Coax or the analogue multichannel outputs. I am also starting to notice that the surround channels cut out frequently. Too bad that the warranty only lasted for 3 months...
1,Same disc problems,"Same issues with discs.Just wanted to confirm with everyone, just like the previous reviews.This is not the only series Bandai has had problems with disc being faulty."
1,still hvnt gotten it yet,"it has been over a month since i've ordered this, and i still have not received it"
3,Miss Lockhart alone justifies the effort.,"Apart from excellent settings and costumes, not to mention the always reliable pulchritude and charm of June Lockhart, this Val Lewton wannabe is mainly a misfire.More's the pity too, since it abounds in shadowy night scenes, fog, and much cloak and daggery, including a final act complete with tilted camera angles, and poisoned milk, (a la Hichcock's ""Suspicion"").But there is no real grue and no real tension, and what we are left with is a lame, (though slickly produced) thriller whose main interest accrues from its interesting cast and glossy staging.Still, given the paucity of Victorian melodramas at your local cineplex--you could do much worse."
1,"Interesting, but could have been better focused","Manuel Pena's analysis of conjunto's evolution is not so much a cogent layman's story of the music and its history, as it is an academic thesis on the socio-economic issues which helped forge the music. There are some interesting facts for the average music fan,..but overwhelming and a little boring is the sociological commentary which seems to go nowhere. Better suited perhaps for social science students. For a more succinct and readable history of the music check out Joe Nick Patowski's sharp Selena bio ""Como La Flor,"" or the excellent ""Billboard Guide to Tejano and regional/Mexican Music"" by Ramiro Burr."
1,Cheap construction,"This is a cheaply constructed chinrest. A good chinrest for beginners and advanced players alike are the Kun rests....for a few dollars more they will last for years, not just a few weeks."
5,The Boys Still Rock,"This is a great little EP, and all fans of REAL Rock-n-Roll owe themselves and must check this release out. The Supersuckers have never let me down live or on disc and I think this new release honors that great tradition. It is simply put, great rock-n-roll, no filler, no crap, just the goods. Paid is probably the greatest summer rock tune never to receive it due, it deserves to be cranked from every car and every radio 24/7. Please check it out. Oh, and catch the band on tour, you really will not be disappointed."
4,Old Keyport Revisited,"Before my sister moved to this small town in Monmouth County, New Jersey, I had never heard of it while growing up in New York City. However, after discovering this book in a local bookstore, I discovered that this town was of some importance to many living in the metropolitan area due to its' seaside retreats, close proximity to Sandy Hook Beach, and the town's many Victorian homes. While Keyport won't stand out among other more popular suburban towns such as Asbury Park, its' charm remains intact. Reading this book gave me a little more background on the town's history and development, and it was interesting to see that many of the sites in the book still remain today.If you are a native of Monmouth County, or have a friend or relative who lives in the area, then this book will be a great inclusion into your library. The town's historical society as well as the author have done an excellent job covering the history of the town that time and modernism somewhat forgot."
1,"If you are remotely considering breastfeeding, this is not the book for you.","The first review sums up my reaction to the substance of the book: 10% substance, 90% fluff, difficult to tolerate jokey writing style. As a mother of two, I found myself wincing and groaning at every snide, snippy, depressing mention of breastfeeding. Gottman has a lot more useful, concrete information about saving your marriage, and ""Confessions of a Naughty Mama"" has a lot better approach to dealing with the loss of closeness in your relationship."
4,Just what I needed,This book gives you reassurance that you are not the only couple going through a major change. These ladies give you real peoples' perspectives. It helped me to understand my husband better.
2,Kind of a let down,"I was really looking for some good reading material as the hubs and I are getting closer to entering the exciting/terrifying adventure that is parenthood and when I stumbled across a few online recommendations for this book I went for it. During the first few pages I got to thinking it was really kind of whiney, just kind of a laundry list of problems, but I thought maybe as I went on they would slowly start recommending some solutions or encouraging advice. I understand parenthood is tough and a lot of the problems that were brought up seem very realistic and in fact likely to occur. However several chapters in I still felt like there was a lot of complaining and more specifically husband bashing. The women in this book make their husbands sound like idiots and all together useless, which I found disheartening and kind of rude. I would not recommend this."
4,section on sex after the baby is a marriage saver,"Although I thought the overall tone of the book to be a little harsh and jaded, it was truthful and blunt. The section on sex after kids is a marriage saver. I never understood it from his perspective before. I learned so, so much. I think every couple should read this section. It would create so much more understanding and compassion.Overall, I would have liked more solutions and less griping... I got the message... marriage after kids is harder. I think they over-proved their point."
4,husband proof,my husband loved this book - i gave it to him to read while on a trip with work. He came back with lots of good advice and ideas. Well done!not many of these types of books get to the male element. This one did.
5,Opened the lines of communication between us,"This book was great. It was funny and honest and I found myself agreeing with 99% of everything said. Plus, it got me and my husband talking about our issues with each other instead of us silently resenting each other. I could read him an excerpt and it opened the lines of communication. It really helped us to see the other's point of view and now we feel much better about our relationship. I highly recommend!"
4,An excellent anime that gets better as it progresses,"(4.5 stars) Wild Arms TV is defintely worth considering! Having played the first 3 games, I can say that you need not play the games to understand the story. In fact, the anime fills in some interesting details about the planet that weren't covered in the games. The mouse-like characters seem quite annoying at first, but in time, they become less irritating. Overall, the main storyline is very interesting, and I found myself wanting to see it through to the end. The side stories are also unique and very well written. Unexpected surprises await up until the very end! If you are looking for something ""different"" than your typical anime, this is it!"
2,almost but not quite,wild arms is a good idea of a anime but other then that had no real hook to it. the stories were just stupid and the little furry things were just anoying i watched 1 out of 6 disks of the anime and had to put it down
1,Very poor quality,"I bought these based off some of the reviews!The filter is poorly constructed, very very low quality.Avoid if you can."
1,not worth at all,"The ridiculous thing is Amazon charge $2.95 for such a tiny book, but the price on the back of the book is only $0.99.Anyway, don't buy it."
5,Goin Up Yonder - Priceless Song,"Of all the songs on this CD, ""Goin Up Yonder"" is my all time favorite. I just went to a good friends funeral recently, and a lady sang it at her funeral, and let the place out. That lady could sing this song almost like Tramaine Hawkins. They had a good deal of great singers at that funeral. Goin Up Yonder is a timeless song and this CD would not be complete without it. I also like ""The Potters House."" It is some great listening and singing on this song. Tramaine outdid herself with this CD. I am glad to have it in my gospel music collection. This CD is a must have for any gospel music collector."
4,"Awkward, but impressive","I bought this on a whim when I purchased a projector from Amazon. As I waited for the delivery, i started kicking myself for ""blowing"" another 100 bucks. I'm really happy I did though.For home use, it is awesome. It folds up neatly and you can throw it in a closet, but when you take it out it is impressively HUGE! I can't help but grin every time i set it up.I can't imagine carrying this around though to do presentations. It is awkward and i'm worried that the little part that rotates will break and I'll have to figure out a way to rig it.But overall, a really nice screen for home use or occasional travel."
4,Huuuuuuge!,"I got this about a year and a half ago. Its HUGE! Even though its a 1:1 screen I only pull about 3/4ths of it out and use it as a widescreen. Works great with my Mitsubishi HC1500.The only thing is that it doesn't balance properly because of its large size and heavy weight. The left side always seems to be higher than the right. I solved this problem by using a new set of Jenga blocks and the container. I hang the container full of the blocks on the left side to bring it down a little, if it comes down too much I take some blocks out. Pretty simple lol, but ghetto. I'm sure there are other ways to go about it, but this was simple and it gets the job done."
3,you always get what you pay for,"Amazingly cheap. Does what it says but the material appears cheap. The upright and leg bars does not appear sturdy. The button lock for the legs is useless, nevertheless, friction and the lower brace/bracket keeps the legs from spreading too far out. The plastic lock that holds the screen to the upright bar and the plastic screw lock for its telescoping extension are ""plastic"" (of course). I don't think they're gonna last with frequent setting up and transporting. Yep, I got exactly what I paid-for. A cheap person like me highly recommends it for its price. Quality is mediocre like this review."
3,It's all right..,"Probably would've gotten a smaller screen. I didn't realize it was so big, should have known better. It's a nice screen but first time using the screen one of the caps on one end of the screen fell off as I was trying to retract the screen. Otherwise it's easy to put up and put down."
5,Great weather stripping tape,"I've been purchasing frost king P/U foam tape for quite a while. The need arose for white foam tape, and frost king delivers another great product. Easy to use, backing peels just fine, sticks to wood, melamine, plastic, and latex paint with no issues, and is as white as you can get with foam (you can see through it a little, but when put on white surfaces or near white things, it matches just fine). I would recommend this tape to anyone who needs a weather seal need fulfilled."
3,Decent book for little dinosaur lovers--nothing special,"For a dinosaur-loving kid (and I was one), this book should work nicely. It's got--you guessed it--heaps of dinosaurs. Plus, in this book the dinosaurs are very friendly: they make nice pets and people helpers. They become fully integrated into human society. That, for a dino-kid, is a great fantasy. However the art is quite mediocre, and the book has few of those curiosities that make a great kids' book. Instead, this is a rather unimaginative take on the dinosaurs' return. A must only for the hard-core dino-kid."
5,This book is just what you've been looking for,"I've tried everything to quit smoking, hypnosis, patches, acupuncture, cold turkey (at least 100 times), and nothing has worked for more than 3 months. I went to the library one day, and this book caught my eye, thank goodness. It is a wealth of information for a smoker wanting desperately to quit. From this book, I have developed my ""3 W"" plan (Water,Walk,and Web). And for me, it's working. Question: When is the website going to be ready? (drandmrsquit.com)"
2,It takes an idiot to know one,"This book is interesting, and I bought it while trying desperatley to quit while I was pregnant. It focuses way too much on available treatment methods (the patch, drugs, etc.) and not enough on practical gradual cessation. I wanted to know exactly what benefits my body was getting for being smoke-free for an hour, a day, a month, etc., because anyone who's quit knows how unbelievably horrible you feel, especially the first week, and what prevented my quitting in the past was not seeing some immediate benefits such as greater oxygen or at least better endurance during exercise. I haven't smoked in 5 years, and I'm glad I quit, but I'm still not understanding how it benefitted me beyond the typical exagerated and questionable research into the likelihood of obtaining certain diseases. A better book is the no nag guide."
2,I also only bought it for The Wedding Song,"Paul Stookey's The Wedding Song (There is Love) is one of the most beautiful, reverent, appropriate songs to play at your wedding, and I'm glad I finally found the original version of it. However, the rest is really bad. Just, bad. If I was less moral I would just search for the MP3."
2,Only one good reason to buy this CD,This CD only has one redeeming quality and that is the inclusion of Paul Stookey's original recording of The Wedding Song...as for the rest of the music...just a waist of good CD space. I am normally much more forgiving on compilation recordings but ACK...save me now?????I bought the CD for the one song which I absolutely HATE to have to do but this song is nearly impossible to find on CD so my money is not entirely waisted...........

1,This book is a fraud.,"I am fairly alarmed at the number of book reviews still out there on the web [Amazon's, I'm afraid, included) that still have the initial glowing reviews of this book 18 months [it was revoked in December, 2002 and I'm writing this in May 2004]after the 2001 Bancroft prize awarded to the author for it was revoked. Michael Bellesiles has also been forced to resign from Emory, dropped by his publisher and his work generally discredited by the academic community (just do a google search).I don't even want to think about how many copies of this book are sitting on library shelves across America being checked out by readers who are going to take this phony's ""work"" at face value..."
1,I have to change my earlier favorable review,"This book convincingly made the case that guns were much less important in pre-Civil War America than usually thought. Unfortunately, the author has basically been convicted of academic fraud by Emory U, where he taught; he was forced to resign. The fraud was based on unverifiable or wrong information he presented in this book. Last week, Columbia U, which awarded him the Bancroft Prize for the book in 2001, rescinded the prize.Of course, I can no longer recommend this book. However, I believe that some of his hypotheses are interesting and I hope that other historians will research them."
1,dreck from a laughingstock,"Fictional facts. Imaginary sources. Made up data. Put them all together and you get ""Arming America"", the polemic of discredited ""scholar"" Bellesiles.More interesting than this waste of paper is the story of how Bellesiles fumbled and stumbled as he desperately tried to make up explanations for his nonexistent data sources and told of those mysterious death threats by his critics. Hilarious!"
2,Not very exciting reading.,"I thought this would be more ""meaty"" than it is. It didn't really convince me one way or the other."
1,A pack of lies.,"Bellisles resigned from Emory after the university released a 40-page indictment of the author's research composed by an investigative committee of three distinguished historians.Enough said.The pity is that he's probably now worthy of a Nobel Peace Prize, like that other famous liar, Rigoberto Menchu."
1,Never actually read the book,but potential buyers should take into account that the author has been fired from his teaching position at Emory University and the Bancroft Award has been rescinded due to the fact that Bellisiles fabricated his supporting information.
1,Calculated Anti-Gun Propaganda,"Although Amazon.com's editorial review continues to claim that ""Bellesiles, who is highly knowledgeable about weapons and military history, never comes out against guns. He is more interested in discovering the truth than in taking sides . . ."", in fact it is now clear that 1) the research done by Bellesiles was knowingly fraudulent; and, 2) the purpose of the book was to provide talking points to the anti-gun lobby - Bellesiles was clearly taking sides. Now that Bellesiles has been thoroughly discredited by his former employer (Emory University) and the previously awarded Bancroft-Whitney Book Award has been revoked (the first time in history that has happened), this book has come to represent a monument to the virulent anti-Americanism that is part and parcel of the gun control movement. Nothing is sacred to these people: not American history and certainly not our American heritage."
5,Reader Comments:,"""This material is the most accurate information on Saginaw history that has been printed. These books will be excellent resource information for generations to come.""""I can't tell you which chapter I've enjoyed most. The text and pictures are so well synchronized. Your research and presentation of it is greatly appreciated.""""I can hardly put the book down! What a pleasure--an interesting book that brings back many memories of stories when I was growing up in beautiful Saginaw."""
1,Simply unwatchable due to rapid fire editing,"I bought this movie because of the 2 stars. The director obviously features them heavily, but he employs rapid-fire editing that will give you a bad headache. He cuts between good scenes and flashbacks to a mind numbing result. I can't watch this movie and I would not recommend it"
2,A strange little movie,"This film isn't exactly what I expected. It wasn't nearly as trashy and gratuitous as I expected ( which is a shame ), but it is reasonably well filmed and some of the acting isn't all that terrible. The Arena offers a fairly historically credible depiction of a military outpost in Roman Britain. The costumes are quite good, and although I find it heavy handed, there is an attempt to utilize a cinema-graphic atmosphere. This film certainly does not resemble a cheap made for TV film. The two female leads ( former Playboy Playmates ) look great, whether naked or not. That doesn't hurt, but there is considerably less nudity than one would anticipate. What a shame....Oddly enough, I think that the film's higher than expected quality to be it's downfall. It's neither fish nor fowl. However, if you're a fan of this genre, you would certainly want to add this flic to your collection."
2,"Unfortunately, Judith Pella is missing...","Sigh. This series needed her. This is the first book that really seems to drag on... and on. I finished it, but this one and Number Six both have way too much getting into Corrie's head and not enough dialog or action. It was never a suspenseful series, but this is too much. Not much else to say, except... sigh."
5,Its a nut !,"What can be said of a nylon nut, they arrived on time, and the quality is good and fit properly.I did not do a price comparison with local supply houses due to time. I am pleased with the price"
3,Tarot Sutra: An Intimate Guide to the Secret Language of Sex,"Interesting; if you are familiar with the cards, very good. If not, time to learn."
4,Family Life,"When a sciencefiction writer, played by John Cusak, decides to adopt a boy, little did he know, at first, that the boy claims to be from Mars. Surprise, surprise! The situation that develops is not aided by his quirky frind nor his sister as he learns just what is required to be a father. The reality of such a situation is greatly displayed by all of the players as they carry out their 'so called' help."
4,A Must See for Adoptive Parents,"We just went to see this movie with 3 of our daughters. It was a wonderful movie, funny, entertaining, serious, romantic, all rolled into one.All adoptive parents or those thinking about adopting should see this movie.It explores the hurt and pain of rejection, and the unconditional love of a father to his son. It explores some of the crisis adoptive parents face with their children.... stealing,lying, emotional isolation, connecting and unconditional love. It is really just a great movie."
5,Fun Movie To Watch,"This is a really fun movie to watch. It's about a guy,David played by John Cusack who adopts a little boy named Dennis who truly believes he is from outerspace. This movie has some really funny parts. It's a truly heartwarming film. At first your not sure the adoption is going to work out and everything, but it does. Dennis has some really odd quirks, he is unlike any other child you have ever seen. When David first sees him he is sitting in a box and wont come out as he doesnt want to be exposed to the sun. This movie is a great film for families or adults alike. I think people of all ages would enjoy it. It's a film I will watch again and again."
2,Too bad the kid was in it.,"There werent really any funny moments in this movie. John Cusack was a great actor but the kid was actually sort of unlikeable. He had this annoying raspy voice. Boring and not funny. I think they could have gotten a lot moreK-Paxwith the Martian theme. I dont think they went anywhere ""deep"" with it in this film (except with, maybe, the book part). Dont get me wrong there were some cute moments in it. So it wasnt a HORRIBLE movie. But I cant say that I really liked it either."
4,not too bad,"As a big fan of Andy Garcia I decided to watch this movie despite some bad reviews and I was actually glad that i did. Movie is a little bit slow sometimes and it's more like a drama than an action packed movie. There are several storylines that interweave so it's not really hard to follow.If you like movies about life choices, movies that make you think outside of your world, movies that have more than just superheroes so you should definitely give it a chance."
4,SNL Review,"A great special for a great show...BUT DON'T BUY THIS VHS! I bought it for 14.95 and i spent 9.95 too much. It is recorded in EP mode, so it doen't come in very well. If you want an SNL special worth every penny, get the 25th Annaversary Special."
2,Mirror of Madness,"I was unimpressed with this album. I didn't even bother to listen to all of it, just what everyone said were the best songs. Frankly, all the songs sounded a lot alike to me, anyway, so I doubt I missed much.These guys apparently have no original ideas of their own, as they seem to copy from a plethora of other bands out there, most of whom were already named in other people's reviews. The guitar work is very power metal, the vocals are nothing special.The lyrics on the second half of the album are just plain awful. The lyrics on the first half of the album are all right, which is maybe the only redeeming quality in this band. Overall, a very sub-par band. I recommend downloading before buying."
2,Tooooo much of everything!,"I was disappointed in this magazine because it tries to cover EVERYTHING and doesn't really focus on just a few issues and then covers them thoroughly. Too much ""we're going to show you how to EAT, dress, decorate and THINK. And too much ""exalted"" consciousness raising. Doesn't know what it wants to be, fashion mag or self-help?"
1,"8 months later, not a single issue...","I ordered a gift subscription at the Amazon $5 rate, and 8 months later, not a single issue has been sent, and not one reply to any email requests for explanations or refunds."
2,This is just not the magazine for me,"I enjoy an occasional Oprah show. I am impressed with her generosity as a human being. However, this is not the magazine for me. It contains too many advertisements and rip-out cards. The subject matter is not interesting to me. I ordered this magazine for a year at just the cost of $2.00 for shipping. I think it was a waste of $2.00. I won't be renewing my subscription."
1,never received,"We have not received this magazine yet, it has been 8 1/2 weeks as of today (2/11/10)."
5,Can't miss!,"I have to admit, I signed up because of the great deal. The Oprah magazine has been a great investment. It is real stuff to apply to every day situations. I'm greatly impressed with all facets of the magazine. From products, to clothing trends, to valuable information on staying healthy."
3,Order when amazon has it for $5 or $10,It's not that $18 is expensive its just that out of a 12 issues 4 maybe really awesome and the rest are so bad you can't believe it's O magazine.
2,it's ok,i've only had had one issue so far and i was not really impressed with it. there just weren't enough interesing articles in it. i'm glad ididn't pay too much for it. can't imagine i will order again.
1,Oprah Magazine = Waste of Money,"Overpriced material items, too many ads, and unoriginal ideas round out this magazine.I wouldn't even read it for free, unless I were in the doctor's office for at least two hours and read everything else first."
3,Late delivery,"I bought this subscription for my wife and she enjoys the magazine, but so far each issue is delivered long after it is available in stores."
5,Best Subscription Service,"I order tons of magazines online and have never been as thrilled as I have been with my amazon purchase. So many companies state ""6-8"" weeks to begin, I got my first issue 10 DAYS after ordering it! Would highly recommend this service"
1,No show O,"I ordered this item in December but have not recieved the first issue. When I placed the order I received notification that I would receive the first issue around Jan. 15, 2010. So at the moment I would not recommend ordering this item. Just glad I do not have much money tied up with this order."
2,Great magazine and good articles but ordering process does not work,"I was really interested in ordering this magazine. I happened to read the articles in April for the first time. I just loved the small business interviews in that issue.Comment after 2 months (I ordered it April 25th and now it is July 3rd: no magazine, nothing...):Is there something wrong with O-magazine's order processing? I've been reading the other comments and it looks like I'm not the only one complaining about this."
4,30 minutes long and still a great work out,"Flats, intervals and hills: each 30 minutes long, just great if you don't have enough time and still feel you got a great work out. This is like a spin class but focused one of three aspects in a class. Nonetheless, you still get a decent work out and you can link two or all three of the work outs together! Great for beginners. The music is in the background, not instrusive and she does like to talk - not annoying."
5,Great Workout!!!,DVD is a good investment for use with the spinning bike...teams up for a great workout! Recommend it!
2,Too Small,Waaay too small for my charm bracelet. Seems too small for a necklace unless you are looking for delicate. Returned the item. Guess I'll need to wait for gold prices to come down:)
1,Too big for me.,"I'm a big guy -- over 6'4"" and 285 lbs -- but this leg pillow was too tall and bulky for me. The indentations also weren't big enough for me. Should I lose 40 or 50 pounds (I'm trying!) the indentation might work better and I'll try it again,."
1,A Piece of JUNK!,"Don't waste your money, its not even worth it, dosent even work. Once the water is in the ball it is very hard to drain the water. Kids didn't care for it at all, they rather play in the standard old school sprinkler that you use to water your grass with."
1,God idea but didn't have good luck.,I was hoping this was going to be a hit but the kids didn't care for it. Also it never moved around like it was supposed to. We ended up tossing it out. Regular sprinkler was more fun for the kids.
1,fills with water.....,"this was a bday present for one of my kids, um, seriously it lasted about 10 minutes before the entire ball filled with water and let me tell you, it is a sight to see! it is so heavy you can't move it and there's no way to drain the water. it is a waste of money and materials but at least we adults had fun kicking it until it ruptured!"
1,Boring,This item was purchased for my toddler but it's boring she would rather play with the garden sprinkler then play with the beach ball sprinkler then a month later my saint bernard tore a huge hole in it.It's not worth getting and is a waste of money.
2,Disappointment,"We bought this sprinkler for a 4th of July party we were having. There were about 6 small children (ages 1-4) there. The toy did great at this party and every one loved it. However, a month later we decided to take it out again for our 15 month old to play in (since our pool had a leak). After about 10 minutes the ball started filling up with water and then quit spraying out altogether. It was great while it lasted but what a huge disappointment."
1,Take your money and just throw it away,"Because that is what you will be doing with this toy. We set it up for our 2 year old son. It worked at total of 10 minutes before the ball filled with water and we could no longer use it. Needless to say, our son was hysterical. Thanks Little Tikes for such a horrible product!"
4,Very fun sprinkler,"This toy has been a hit this summer. My daughter and her friends love to run around ""dodging"" the water."
1,Very Disappointing,"I have seen Heather Graham's books around before, but had never read any of her stuff, When I picked up ""Ghost Walk"" it sounded very intereting so I deceided to give it a go.This book read like a child had scribbled it down, I hated the characters, they were all annoying, and I will never read another HG book again. God how tripe! The editors should have thrown this one in the bin.All the characters had an I.Q of 0.Vicki from Canberra"
5,seiko is my favorite watch.,"This time piece is very nice. I love the simple yet sophisticated look this watch gives you in either casual polo,flip flops, and shorts or when I wear my suits to dinner. This is my second Seiko automatic and cherish both dearly. The copper backround is subtle enough so it will not stand out too much like bling, but stands out enough to compliment any outfit and look great on your arm."
1,Whining without insight,"This is a total turnoff. Yes, the author's situation was bleak. No, the author does not have to be a saint to be worth reading. But her whining, self-absorbed account of continuing destructive behavior lacks insight. The reader is left with an off-putting narrative that lacks resolution of any kind."
1,no one in my book group like it,"My book group--a dozen or so educators--was unanimous in their decision--this was a bad book. No one was able to like or even empathize with the author. We had chosen this book with great enthusiasm after reading good reviews. We all donated them to the local library book sale without any desire to share the book with our mothers, daughters or anyone else."
3,Humorous But Lacking,"This was a pretty enjoyable read. It could have been a lot better, though. I didn't realize going into it that it was part of a series, so maybe I missed something by not reading the first novel in the series.It was quite a humorous novel, and I liked that it didn't take itself too seriously. Like I said, it could have been a lot better. It was very, very boring at the beginning. There were also certain chapters (the Abby Normal ones) that I felt could have either been better or just scrapped completely. Those chapters were annoying and just felt like filler.There was also a problem with how the story was put together. There were so many plot and subplot lines and they, again, just felt like filler. It was hard to keep up with what was going on sometimes. And some of the story was not developed enough.I wish that this had been better. I really wish I could give it a better review than I've given it, but this is what it really deserves."
2,Not Quite There,"The sequel to ""Bloodsucking Fiends,"" ""You Suck"" has none of the novelty - and very little of the charm - of the original book. While a lot of the same humor is present, the characters lack the development of the first novel, and the plot itself seems redundant. ""You Suck"" is an amusing read, but don't expect it to be as delightful as the first."
2,Not as funny,"This book isn't as funny as I was lead to believe. It did have its moments - most coming from the semi-minor character of Abby Normal. Her sarcastic and dramatic attitude is reminiscent of Ellen Page's Juno. I also thought there was a lot of build up for a not so big resolution of the problematic ""father"" vampire and the manipulative blue hooker."
2,"This book ""sucks""","I've been reading Moore since Practical Demonkeeping and have enjoyed his work for years. I came to him through Tom Robbins (like many of you, perhaps) and like Robbins, I have found Moore's rude wit, clever word play, black humor, and his subject matter highly entertaining.That said, however, this is a weak addition to his catalogue. I couldn't finish this book because I found his wit, word play, and humor here to be puerile, crass, and vulgar. This sequel to the fabulous Bloodsucking Fiends seems rushed, as if he put it on the market to satisfy the demand for it and the plot suffers for it."
4,"Great book, surpise ending!","I really enjoyed this book, I read through it rather fast, which is okay, but that means it is a page turner. The characters were spot-on and there's some great humour spread through the book. I really love Christopher Moore's ability to write so comically about such a serious subject. I recommend this book for vampire lovers, and people who hate vampires as well."
5,I laughed til my sides hurt!,"My son recommended Christopher Moore as a writer. He loved reading Lamb. His sweet girlfriend has read just about everything Moore has written. An old lady English major cannot go wrong taking the advice of two twenty-somethings who are also English majors! While I liked Bloodsucking Fiends, I loved this book. The characters from the first book in the series seem to have ""come into their own,"" and the new characters are charming in their idiosynchrasies. The Abby Normal character's journal is just too funny!!!!!!!! I would highly recommend this book to anyone who loves to laugh and loves quirky characters."
4,Great out of the gate,Typical great ride by Mr Moore leaves alot of room for a sequel look forward to it.
3,Excellent fun!,"Hilarious! A book strictly for laughs. Cute, the story is designed for bringing on smiles mixed with occasional giggles. Lots of neat characters who are drawn with just enough description to recognize but not too much to weigh down the light hearted tone despite death, murder, torture and vampires! Really fun to read. The one character I'd love to see more of is the minion Abby Normal. The young woman has more moxie than any other character I've met in a book this year. The only negative was that she wasn't more often in the action. Good book."
5,I couldn't put this book down!,"A truly excellent read. It has been some time since I enjoyed a book so much. Having lived in Japan for a few years I can certainly relate to many of the scenes and characters depicted in it. Brilliantly funny with a story line that keeps you guessing right up till the end. I couldn't put the book down and like many others who have reviewed the book here, I am eagerly awaiting Superchick 2."
3,"Good idea, but needed another draft","I could tell right off this writer isn't from the south. Even if I'm a northerner, I've read enough southern literature to know the vernacular in this particular book is 'off' and distracting. There are enough stories about abused southern kids out there (Bastard out of Carolina and Before Women Had Wings come heavily to mind) that just this detail felt like a huge cliche. Add that to the surprise ending (which I sniffed out in chapter one) and I found myself left with a book that sounded good in the abstract, but didn't quite win me over. Good premise, but it isn't a book I'm going to remember a year from now."
3,Made me furious,"The story was intriguing and I liked the writing style, but I will never read this again. I was clenching my fists and wanting to vomit throughout at least half of this book. Who could treat little children like this? It is scary to think that, at any given time and any given place, abuse like this is probably occurring."
1,Excellent writing but I hated this book,"This was a book club selection so I had to finish it. It got a good response from most everyone in our book club but I have to say, I hated this book and would never recommend it to anyone. I was depressed the whole time I was reading it."
2,Good Writing - But I Hated It,"If this was not a book club selection, I would have never finished it. Although the pacing and plot of this story were lacking, I can find little fault with the author's writing.My main complaints: 1) The ""shocking plot twist"" was obvious from about thirty pages into the story and 2) I'm just sick and tired of these stories where the daddy/stepdaddy gets drunk and beats the hell out of everyone."
3,"So sad, yet frustrating at the same time","This book has taken me weeks to read. A friend recommended this and said, ""...and there's a twist at the end."" So I figured I'd read it, what the heck. As another reviewer said, it was a very frustrating read. I had to put it down at times because of the horrible abuse these girls had to endure! How anyone could treat a child like that is beyond me. And their mother! She just stood to the side every time. I think the worst for me was when Richard tied chains around their necks and made them sit out in the sweltering sun for a whole day. And for others to notice the signs of abuse, but not do anything. I don't know. I'm glad I read it, but I'm also glad I'm done and can return it to its owner. And was it just me, or was I the only one not completely surprised at the end?"
5,Fantastic read,The book was recommended to me by a friend.The development of the Emma character was wonderful. Both characters came alive in their struggles.
3,Okay book,"This book was a little different than the books I usually read. For the first half of the book I wondered if I really wanted to finish it. It dragged and didn't gip me to keep me interested, however, toward the second half it got a bit better. The ending wasn't that much of a surprise, which was disappointing. I think it was a tad boring."
4,Not an original idea,"As I was reading this book I felt manipulated by the author. Women are sucked in by books about abused children. It pulls on our heart strings and to abandon the book would be equivalent to abandoning those children. You felt compeled to finish to be sure they were ok and the suffering would stop. You felt anger, especially toward the mother who should protect her children but ignored and contributed to the abuse. It seemed to be another book about abused and neglected children...done to death. The twist redeemed the author."
3,Canopic Jars A Little Smaller than Expected,I do like the product however i was under the impression that they were going to be a little bit bigger. All in all i am satisfied with the product. Thanx!
3,Good for purpose...just not for me,while the glue holds well ... the product was not suited for my door... ..... ..... .... . .. ..
1,Unbelievable failure on this item.,"Starrett is supposed to be the gold standard of straightness, but my 12"" straightedge started out perfect and then WARPED lengthwise so badly as to be completely unusable.I live in the California Sierra mountains, and that straightedge was exposed to sub-freezing temperatures in my workshop over several years, but I still cannot believe that those temperatures made that metal warp THAT profoundly. None of my other tools - Lie-Nielsen planes - were affected in the slightest.I have yet to get an answer from Starrett as to how and why this happened, but I now cannot trust Starrett tools to be all that they are sold to be. That is too bad, but honestly this straightedge is warped like a banana. Unbelievable."
4,Inexpensive and functional,"I have had no trouble getting this card to work on Windows 7, it was plug and play.I didn't even bother with their drivers, because it works fine with the Windows drivers. You do need to know a little about BIOS in order to configure it as a RAID controller though. Out of the box, it comes set up for internal SATA/non-RAID.It's true that you can only use the internal SATA OR the external eSATA ports and not both, but I understood that when purchasing, and only planned to use the internal ports. I took off one star for the description not being clear that you can only use two ports at a time."
5,A great read.,This book goes into great detail about the reformation but is easy to read and hard to put down. I would recommend it to anyone researching the reformation.
5,aaaa++++,"I keep this CD in my car and listen to it all the time. I sent one to my son. He sings lots of the hymns that I am familiar with since childhood. I am waiting for ""Just as I am"" now."
4,Nostalgically Engaging,"I found both of these films captivating from beginning to end. ""Dracula's Daughter"" picks up from where the original ""Dracula"" starring Bela Lugosi left off. Professor Van Helsing now finds himself arrested for the murder of the infamous vampire through whose heart he had just driven a stake.""Son of Dracula"" was a great story as well. I am always a little reticent about watching the legendary actors take on the roles of the villains they were not best known for. Lon Chaney, Jr. who is remembered best as the incomparable ""Wolfman"", now plays a descendant of Count Dracula, who in my humble opinion has never been played by ANYONE better than Bela Lugosi. However, Lon Chaney, Jr. does indeed do justice to the film because he is an outstanding actor and legend in his own rite. The film is compelling, well acted, and thoroughly entertaining."
2,too tight a buttonhole,"This strap-holder has been okay once I got it on correctly, but really the buttonhole needs to be a little larger, or the button a little smaller, as it was EXTREMELY difficult to put on.Now that it's on my guitar I intend to keep using it...but I would not buy another for other guitars, it's too much of a pain to deal with."
4,It works,I bought this after reading the reviews about how hard it is to strap in to the Martin guitar. Being a newbie I bought it....well it works fine but I don't find it very useful since I don't have any problems using the standard attachment points on my Martin.
2,Didn't work with my Planet Waves locking strap,"This was a good looking accessory, but it didn't work with my guitar strap - a planet waves locking strap."
3,Tea: A pleasant blend,"Overall, not a bad little movie if you can hang in there with it, though it was rather slow in some areas.The story follows two young British girls, best friends, from about eight years old up through adulthood. One girl is from broken home and the outgoing one, and the other from the stable one child home is the wallflower.There is definately some drama between the two, each budding to break from their chains.Good acting, decent story, a nice subplot love story going on.My only issue was this movie lacked a great story, something with more punch (drama) to move it along faster. And possibly some stronger characters as well.I'm on the fence about whether I would buy this or not for my collection."
3,Creative Writing 101,"Ms. Smith has her strong points - modernizing character and plot for one. All six of the books in this series kept me reading to the end because of the really smart plots loosely based on Austen's novels.However, the writing style is textbook ""how to write a novel"" language to an extreme that it at times takes you out of the story to say ""people don't talk that way!!!"". Creative writing classes teach rules that are meant to be broken, but Ms. Smith writes on a basic level that is simplistic and too clearly novel-speak. In one page, a car is referenced 3 times. Creative writing rule: don't repeat words. Time to break the rule: when saying car 3 times is less distracting than saying car, vehicle and automobile. A more skilled author uses language that is so deft the reader is unaware of it. Ms. Smith doesn't accomplish that, and it is at times quite annoying."
2,I really hoped for better things . . .,"I really hoped to enjoy this book more. I forced myself to keep reading several times, hoping for more substance. This book was terrible--too wordy, too predictable, just too much of whatever and not enough of good, crisp writing. However, I must say that I appreciate the Christian values of the book."
1,Capitalizing on Jane Austen's legacy,"As an admirer of Jane Austen's genius, it disturbs me that writers like to take her stories and ""modernise"" them, or, in this case ""christianize"" them. Jane would be appalled. Firstly, she herself was a devout Christian woman, whose father was a minister in their parish. To say that Miss Austen's books are ""non-Christian"" and do not convey ""christian values"" is simply absurd. Please, do yourself a favor and read the originals before resorting to Ms. White's series. This series is, at its worst, plagiarism, and at its best, nothing more than fanfiction."
4,"I Love Pride And Prejudice,And Thoroughly Enjoyed This Western Version","I found First Impressions to be a really fun read.I liked the whole plot of the hero and heroine meeting through their both having parts in the same play. That was a totally new plot for me.I also like how their romance developed, despite the initial friction and verbal sparring."
5,I would reccomend this book to readers of my age and older.,"This book was a very good way to reaveal the girls feelings. For example I read the book to find I knew exactly how they felt being transferd through the mirror,falling through the lake during an ice-skating party or just being different. I would reccomend this book to all eight year olds and older."
2,"Works for Devotions with a small child, but light on moral teaching","I have to agree with the previous reviewer about the language of this book. When someone talks about a child being 'bad', I find it irritating, but for an author to focus on words like 'naughty', 'bad', 'nice' in a book that is supposed to teach children about having making choices that truly please God, is the essence of talking down to a child. Even a three-year old can handle more descriptive adjectives than that.The spanking thing bugged me too. Why is this the first resource to turn to when a child does something wrong?That said, my three-year old loves the book because the lessons are short and work for him. We haven't skipped any of them, but sometimes I move quickly through the ones I like least.A book I liked a lot more is ""20 Bible Verses Every Child Should Know"". Both kids (and mom) loved it, but you can only read any devotional book so many times..."
1,Boring,"This show was so boring, and incredibly scripted. I must say did give me an interesting perspective into gypsy like that I have not seen on TV before. But I just could not get into it."
1,Fern Willow Review,"I did not really like this book . I do not think it is well written or very interesting. Most people already know that alot of things are not a coincidence. The world is full of wonder and beauty. Most of us do not need the kind of instruction in this book. It makes us seem dumb to suggest we need this. I think most people are smart this way by nature. This book confuses people about what is true,spiritual and related to God. It would not seem to be a good guide for teenagers at all."
2,This is Hell?,"I would have thought Hell would be a hell of a lot worse than this farce. Very poorly organized, this module odes not give me any feeling of Hell whatsoever. Where are the souls suffering for their moral turpetude? Instead, Hell is just a realm of badass demons and devils. As usual, there is little to no roleplaying. Players will be confused and bored at times. Steer clear."
2,May be the translation,"I read the turkish translation of this book, and was a little bit suprised to see the huge difference between this one and his other novels. This book was not ""flowing"" like the others did, then i realized that, the translator was a different person, only for that one; so she was the one to blame:) Anyways, i still recommend starting with his other books, especially with Samarkand, to see how a great writer he is."
5,Really happy!,"This is one of my favorite books! I'm really happy with my purchase. The book was even in a better condition them described, perfect like new. Shipping was on time, and the book arrived intact in a nice cardboard. I love it!"
1,The worst DBZ movie ever,"I have seen all 13 DBZ movies and ""Lord Slug"" is the worst.Cheesy plot and VERY boring.Go watch Movie 5 and 12(when they come out in America)and you'll be amazed."
2,Sadly not a great DBZ movie,Many people consider this the worst DBZ movie although I think 11 is worse movie 4 aka Lord Slug(Super Saiya-jin Goku) was supposed to be out last November and now comes out with a new name but sadly the same lame movie about old Slug who wants to be young again and runs smack into Goku. Thankfully movie 5 and 6 should be out soon and Coola will burst on the scene and make us foget all about what a lame villian Slug is!
2,PYLE of #%#&@ is more like it,"This unit is definitely a bad choice if you are in the market for a dvd head unit. Its just plain crappy. Cant set the time to 12/24 standard, button are impossible to read, tuner is absolutely maddening to operate. Just steer clear of this one."
4,a feminist novel by Charlotte Bronte's closest friend,"Apparently there's some controversy over whether Taylor wrote the book or whether Bronte did. I'm no Bronte scholar, but the style didn't particularly remind me of Bronte (and I've read all of her novels, some multiple times), and the subject matter was far more overtly feminist than Bronte ever allowed herself to be.The novel traces the lives of four women - Sarah (the ""Miss Miles"" of the title), Maria, Dora, and Amelia - focusing particularly on their efforts to gain economic independence and thus on women's role in society. Perhaps fewer heroines would have improved the plot, as it was a little confusing to be constantly switching viewpoints and plot threads. However, it was extremely refreshing to read a Victorian novel that actually showed women out earning a living for themselves (or trying - one of them fails and pays the price)."
3,frankenstein,"I have not seen either of the movies,they were a gift so i have no clue as to what to rate them."
4,The Ali vs. Frazier Monster Movie of All Time!,"4 Stars = ClassicThis review is just for ""Frankenstein Meets the Wolfman.""Two legendary monsters meeting for the first time, in the main event of the 20th century, which may be a tad disappointing in decades of retrospect, but then again, I've thrilled time & time again to this battle!What really saves this film is the great ensemble acting, a very good story line, sharp direction, & of course, Frankenstein's monster & the Wolfman! The showdown of two of the most legendary, iconic monsters of all time!Worth the price of admission for this film alone!"
5,Inspiring,"I met Michael while playing some music with him at a concert he gave in Northern Ireland. He gave me a copy of this title on cassette but it has worne thin and I was desperate to get another copy. It isn't possible to get it in Ireland so I was just delighted to see it on this site. Even for a non religious person the music itself is very uplifting. For those who are religious, the lyrics of the songs are an added bonus. A wonderful selection of songs to be always treasured."
4,Excellent Introductry Selection of Layouts,"If you are interested in O-Scale layouts from 4'x8' small and simple to large and complex (12' x 32'), this book is a great small compendium both of interesting designs and tips for successful layout construction. It is well illustrated and very practical.But, buyer beware... there are curious errors... I did a detailed study of John Long's 'Tinplate Central' layout included. The article claims that the layout is an O-32 layout and lists O-32 track segments required. But the layout is clearly an O-27 layout and a careful look at the measurements on the layout page show curve radii of 13.5 inches. That major error slipped by the editors both of the original article as well as the reviewers of the articles chosen to be included in the book.At least one other reviewer has found similar errors.- Markus Robinson, Tunkhannock, PA"
2,O scale layouts,"I always find it difficult to buy books without being able to browse through them first because you never know what you'll get. This is a typical example. I was expecting a larger number of layouts, particularly for a 4x8 size table. Not only the variety of layouts were limited, there was not enough information about the track pieces needed."
5,Doesnt disappoint,"As usual Dyens Doesnt disappoint. In my opinion best Aranjuez, plus you get Metis and tango en skai orchestral version"
3,Good for Beginners,"I liked this video. Scott Cole is very good at explaining and is easy to watch the mirror image. The only thing I expected was a longer sequence, which is only 12 minutes. For a quick wind down before bed this is great. It doesn't state that this is for beginners and I would have liked more time, and more movements."
1,You get what you pay for,I wish I would have done my internet homework before buying this TV. Do a search on the internet for Westinghouse problems. I took the first one back and they exchaged it after having me replace the cables; then the new DVD. Several trips back to the store and 20 days later the second one is doing the same thing. It appears to be a firmware problem. I work in the electronics production field and can tell you this is what happens when Program Managers rush to make sales and or delivery schedules. Now I am stuck with having to ship it to California for who knows how long.
2,Eh... no,"I am not one who is interested in meditation type workouts so this one isn't for me. I watched the video to determine if I could just omit the meditation at the beginning and work from there and the cardio part seems very energetic, possibly fun and is maybe something I can do, but I was disappointed with the lack of description of the moves prior to going into them. The moves are all thrown together making it easy to get lost in transition. The routine contains so many different moves as well that it is so easy to get confused for a beginner or someone who has not completely memorized the entire routine. This makes working out with this DVD pointless since you are unable to follow the moves. It was very annoying to say the least and I am not sure that I am even going to attempt it at all."
4,Some of his best work,"Occasionally uneven collection but contains what is arguably Keaggy's greatest songwriting (his most underrated attribute): Maker of the Universe, Here and Now, Let Everything Else Go, Noah's Song. Maker of the Universe is worth the price of the CD alone. If you like Keaggy's songwriting and his mellow side, this is his best CD Other than the outstanding 2CD collection of his Jesus Freak period -- What a Day/Love Broke Through."
5,Best painting movie ever.,Learn your roots before you branch out. I watch this movie 2-3 times a month. Learn something every time. Do whateveris necessary to watch this. (Take notes)
4,Painter Painting,"Pretty good film covering a good range of artists. If your knowledgeable on artist then you might already know a lot on these guys, but it's still a great film!"
3,Terk HDTVO Amplified Antenna,"Installation=fasterners were messed up, cheap, couldn't get a wrench on them.Reception=not as far away as advertised, can't get nearly as many stations as expected, raised it six ft but still no better. Only getting a 5 more local stations than with rabbit ears. Occasionally, we get more distant stations but nothing consistently. Picture is good when we can get it."
3,Weak Plastic WATCH OUT!,This antenna's side 'wings' fold. The problem is once you have opened up the wings and snapped them into position it is difficult to get them back to the closed position without breaking the plastic hinge area. I broke mine the same day I got it. I was able to try the reception and honestly it doesn't do any better then an HD antenna half its price. I've had the best results using the C4 Clearstream long range antenna. It's size is similiar to this terk but just in a different way (it's not as wide but a little taller). It does cost a tad bit more but well worth it. I also had the Db2 which is half the price of the terk HDTVo and worked better.
1,Try Rabbit Ears First....,"I bought this because I'm about 25 miles from the OTA HD stations. Tried several different mounting positions and couldn't pick up more than one station at a time, none of which had a very strong signal. After two days of working with the Terk, I picked up a $30 indoor antenna - set it up in the attic and picked up 4 channels with mid-level strength. Returned the Terk the next day. May work fine in some areas, but I would try the $30 solution first."
1,Not Satisfied,This antenna just didnt do a good job. I returned it and bought a clear channel one that works very well.
3,Look can decieve,You would think because it's outside & up higher you would get a great signal...wrong. My inside antenna works better and is more reliable.
1,worthless,I live in the center of a large metropolitan area but needed better reception for my tv. After a lot of time spent installing the Terk HDtv Amplified Antenna near the top roofline of my house and using a high grade coaxial cable to connect it to the tv I discovered that my indoor rabbit ears antenna gave me better reception that the Terk.
4,A good product,"This is a good product, easy to install in a varity of methods with installation fixtures provided. My only criticism regards the two dipole elements which collapse to the center for ease of packaging. When the dipole is opened up, the latch mechanism to hold it open is unreliable. I found it necessary to apply epoxy glue to the hinge to ensure that the dipole would stay opened up."
2,NO RECEPTION,"Installed antenna, cabled it using the old connection (outdoor Coax), plugged-in the Signal Amp, attached the TV, aimed it as instructed by the Website in PRECISELY the direction shown, and NO RECEPTION. So I replaced the end on the cable at the antenna, still no reception. Re-attached the old Antenna, same reception as before (not really that bad, just hoped to pick-up more channels).Not at all impressed with this 'Digital' product. My old antenna with it's 'Radio Shack' amp out-performs it 20 to 1."
4,Turk HDTVo - thumbs up,"I live 60 miles north of Denver and I can get 38 channels with my new HDTVo antenna. The unit was easy to install, align to maximize gain for the Denver channels, and the unit works really well. I've already got a nice return on my investment... it is great to get ride of cable and save $60/month!"
2,"Antenna works great, amplifier doesn't",This antenna worked great for about a week until amp failed. I had to replace it with a radio shack amplifer which cost as much as the antenna. So far so good after putting the new amplifier.
4,Works great.,"I received most of the same channels before, but they cut in and out constantly. This fixed the prob. It's big but light enough for one person to install."
3,turk HDtv antenna,I have had this antenna for a couple of months and it seems to do the job. the towers are 40-50 miles away and it picks up the signal very well. A light weight easy to install. I would buy this antenna again.
2,It's an Ok introduction,"I agree with the majority of reviews, this book isn't as good as it sounds. Haven't tried using the code, but thought it was in a poor object oriented style, and doesn't lend itself to reuse straight off the CD.A more detailed review an overview of the books chapters can be found at www.tarsiersoft.com/BR/cppaa-en.htm"
4,Don't Underestimate Allison...,"Though I still like the version with Sheryl Crow better, I can't deny that Allison Moorer is an awesome singer. Her voice is very different. While Sheryl's singing is bit higher and pop-like, Allison's voice has a more down-home grittiness to it. Which is appropriate because she is a country singer. We've all heard and love the song so you know it's great. Whether you'd like this version as good as the popular one depends on your taste. I love it."
5,I LOVE THIS NEW SONG,"I have just recently started listening to Kid Rock. My first experience was "" CROSSROADS"" on CMT with Hank Williams Jr. I think Kid Rock has done it again with this new song featuring Sheryl Crow ""Picture"". I love it and play it over and over. 5 stars, hats off to Kid and Sheryl. I think we'll make a southern rock, and country boy out of him yet. Keep it up.. suggestion-- do a album with Hank Jr. All my roudy friends rides again...amen. I think I'll send a copy of this to my ex."
1,"Liked it better when it was called ""Islands in the Stream""","Kid Rock is the most derivative of derivative ""musicians"" when it comes to acoustic songs. This is simply a rewrite of ""Islands in the Stream."""
1,Picture,"I would just like to know why I can't find a Single of ""Picture"" with Kid Rock and Sheryl Crow???? That's the version I first heard and that's the version I WANT !!"
5,Due South: Season Three (4-DVD Digipack),"Due South is such a great series--really glad to finally have Season Three in my collection. Paul Gross is wonderful as Constable Benton Frasier (Canadian Mountie); and I definitely prefer David Marciano as Ray Veccio, over Callum Keith Rennie--but he's a good actor & I got used to him after a while. The paper-style packaging keeps the DVD's well-protected, much to my surprise, and allows 4 disks to fit in smaller space than the normal hard-cover cases. (Not sure I would want all of my DVD's in those, however, since I'm not always careful with my boxes.) My order arrived in excellent condition and in a timely manner, as always!"
2,2 stars for packaging,"I have a hard time trusting the quality of a dvd release when the company can't even bother to package it with a photo of the correct actors. The third season co-starred Callum Keith Rennie (as Ray Kowalski) yet I don't see CKR on any of the packaging for this US release. Its a simple matter to check & frankly makes me wonder what else suffered from laziness on this release. (David Marciano only guest starred a couple of times in the season).Also, it would be nice if the amazon editors would actually list the episodes included on this release. Thankfully other reviewers give enough hints to figure out how this differs from the Canadian release (series 3 & 4) of the same episodes. By the way, the Canadian release actually gets the packaging correct and features actor Rennie as he should be."
2,nice product...poorly shipped,"This Product is nearly exactly what I was looking for, however it was shipped in a box that was too large, and wrapped in only one sheet of bubble wrap. The product slid around in the box and was damaged. Several of the ""grape"" marbles came off as well as some of the metal leaves. The leaves were at least still in the box but the marbles disappeared, I can only assume through a hole in the box itself. Some of the wire spirals that hold wine bottles were also bent out of place. Fortunately, a friend of mine is a welder and was able to straighten things out, it looks good now. except for the missing marbles (about five of them)"
2,Sad Excuse for a Collection of Greatest Hits,"It has too few of the songs we want to play. Where is ""3 Days""?I was bummed by this collection."
5,best canibus album ever!!,"if you said canibus ain't dope your a lier. I always thought Canibus was one of the best Mc's of all time, and this album really proves it. Rap has never been worse then it is today, where people like Chingy and other wack rappers get noticed,but their rhymes are 3rd grade rhymes, Canibus gets left behind, because people probably are not smart enought to know what he is talking about. I am from Cali and I am pretty much expected to listen to Snoop, Dre, Cube and others, even though they are tight, I need to listen to someone who is Intellectual minded like I believe I am, everytime I listen to him he talks about something I have always wondered. The only rapper I like better then bis is TUPAC, but Canibus' flows are just out of this world. THE GREATEST MC TODAY and EVER!! Eminem is no match for Canibus. Buy this album if you have a little Intellectual in you, and if you want to hear the tightest lyrics you have ever heard."
5,"This album is the truth, LL cool j fans need not read this!",Canibus ripped that female named LL COOL J to bits and continues tearing up mics; the God has blessed us with another classic album. The majority of hip-hop heads couldn't understand Bis because they have no scientific or philosophical knowledge! Cop this album!
1,Don't read this for a suspense thriller.,I was seduced by the advertising into believing that this was a suspense thriller of the kind made popular by Anne Perry and Minnette Walters. Boy was I disappointed! It's pure romance! Suspense is purely incidental. Adler could have written a good thriller if she had left out ALL the romance and substituted intricate plotting like Michael Connelly. She didn't and destroyed what might otherwise have been a good read
2,An okay book for preachers,"Once again the hype doesn't match the book. This was not advertised as a book for preachers and their helpers, yet that's what it is. I know a lot about alternative thinking(and still need to know more), yet this book is going to Goodwill, hoping it will find a better use. The chapter on ""plussifing"" gives too much credit to Disney, and not to the folks that brought it to life--PIXAR(maybe even before Steve Jobs sold PIXAR to Disney). Overall I can only say I'm looking for someone who can learn some great techniques for use in a church setting."
5,Great read,"This is a really great read from one of the great teachers of our generation.Great insight, wisdom and understanding in releasing the creative person in each of us"
2,Yikes! It burbs!,"I wouldn't recommend the undergravel filter with only one bubble tube, the problem being that air bubbles build up underneath the filter in the corners and suddenly erupt with a BURP spewing debris and huge air bubbles up and out through the gravel, my poor Silver Dollars think they are under attack and smack into the glass! My other tank has a filter with a tube in each corner and it works perfect, going to buy that one now, poor fish!"
1,Avoid this book,"I have read hundreds of technical computer books and I own many of them, so I can judge very well if a book is worthwhile. ""J2EE: The Complete Reference"" by Jim Keogh is the ""WORST"" book I have ever read. There are errors in almost every illustration and example. I expect one or two typos, but this is beyond belief. It was a total waste of my time to read and money to buy. Avoid this book and do not waste your time and money."
1,Waste of money,"After reading all the reviews about this book i decided to buy it from amazon. Next time i will read more about bad comments than good ones.The most i hate about books is ""quick reference guides"".I'd like to have back 30% of money back since 30% of this book is just cut&paste; from javaDoc.The book is too approximately on most the subjects, expecting reading 7 pages of introducion to a subject and than 4-7 pages of java API!!IMOH,this is not the ""complete"" reference."
2,Don't quite understand why others rate it so high,"I recently bought this book after seeing 16 5-star reviews here on Amazon.com I don't find this book particularly useful. It covers a lot of topics, but none of them well. For example, EJBs are covered briefly. It does not mention any EJB patterns, any pitfalls in the EJB design. Even basics are not covered that well. Basically, this book is probably a good thing if you want to prepare for the job interview or want to quickly brush up on some basic J2EE concepts. It's is not a good book to really learn J2EE architecture and implementation details."
5,great tool,bought this to break some concrete around my pavers and it did the job very easily. cant go wrong with any Fat Max products.
4,Simple Design Makes Worlds of Difference,"I used this a lot in demolishing a brick surround this past weekend. I did eventually use an air hammer to finish the job, but that is beside the point. The point is that it takes a huge beating and works quite well. This is definitely great steel and the hand guard is simply indispensable. I shutter just thinking of the pain I've endured on previous projects without it.I took away a star because soon into the work, the handle including guard started sliding up, as in I could have slid the whole thing off. Not a huge deal because every time I hit it, it would slide back down. Now that I've used and abused this tool, the head has flattened just enough that it now keeps the handle in place.A simple tool, but the kind of thing that makes you want to consider some other Stanley tools."
4,james dickey.....,"Dickey may be somewhat unpopular because his work is politically incorrect by today's standards. He fought in WWII, was a Southerner, wrote a bestselling novel that was made into a popular film--all things academics are uncomfortable with. But his poetry is up there with the best of his generation."
1,What's with the cover???,"Now I'm just curious as to why anyone would look at this book and think it could possibly be good? I'm not one to judge books by their covers generally, but come one! This is a crime against not only Photoshop, but nature as well! This is the single weirdest, creepiest thing I've ever seen. I wish I could clean this image out of my brain."
2,Not Great!,"This received 2 stars due to Traed. Those were the only parts worth reading. Though they were brief and few, they were funny and typical Matrix of Destiny material. The rest just sucked. Sorry Dara, but do considering remedying things with Dorchester."
2,Cute Bugs Are Not Durable,"I was so excited to get this puzzle for my little ones. Unfortunately, the item description is misleading. The puzzle looks nice (before the kids get to it) and the chunky pieces were a perfect size! However, this puzzle is NOT hand painted. The puzzle pieces are just faced with a sticker, that easily comes off (in pieces!). That is not the quality I was expecting, especially from Melissa and Doug. I've had the puzzle for 2 months now, and 2 or 3 of the pieces have the stickers mostly peeled off. Very disappointed."
4,Cute chunky puzzle,"I love melissa and doug products. This product, like all of them is bright, durable, cute and educational. My two year old can't get enough!"
4,like it,The puzzle is colorful and engaging. It seems sturdy and will certainly be well used. I am very happy with this one.
5,Amazing creepy puzzle,"I was shocked to see the somewhat poor reviews on this puzzle. I bought one three years ago when my daughter was barely more than a baby and she just loved it! Its one of nearly dozen Melissa and Doug ones I've bought her over the years and next to the princess ones, its her favorite. Just like the others, its held up over time & looks nearly as good today as it did when I bought it. The only reason I'm even on this page is to buy another one for my youngest because my daughter lost two of the pieces! I wish she had lost the spider one though, that one is a little creepy.... =)"
4,Incomplete Fifties Studio Recordings,"I am glad to see the continued interest in Jay and Kai's recordings. The tracks on this collection are some of the greatest jazz ever recorded. However, this collection is NOT complete. It omits the ten tracks from the Columbia album ""Jay and Kai"", CL 973. The omitted tracks are as follows: You'd Be So Nice to Come Home To / Caribe / Happiness Is A Thing Called Joe / The Song Is You / In the Wee Small Hours of the Morning / Tromboniums in Motion / How High the Moon / Violets for Your Furs / Too Close for Comfort / 'S Wonderful. These tracks were recorded in 1955 and 1956, and should have been included on this collection, as they are quintet tracks (2 trombones, piano, bass, drums), except for a few which have added conga or bongo."
4,Good,"For the price, there is no better collection. It is Untermeyer's special gift to make it more fun to read.The author's commentary between each poem can break your pacing but it was a cheap book and every once in a while he has something interesting to say."
1,Outdated,"This was probably a good book when first printed, but that 7 years ago and a lot of the information is no longer valid. Not a good reference, because although a lot is changed, none of it is reliable anymore due to age of info."
2,Jacob Coleman,"I showed Niki Lord my thing of the item:* Stuart Little (Deluxe Edition) / Stuart Little 2 (Special Edition) / The Trumpet of the SwanI printed the image from EPSON. But that will be super-dee-duper!I added that to Shopping List and it was NOT all the buying options on this mobile site. It says:Currently unavailable. We don't know when or if this item will be back in stock.I love u!!!!! Goodbye, Lazy Brat!!"
3,A time and memory piece,It's important to keep this film in historical perspective. This was the first big budget Hollywood film with a gay theme. Also controversial at the time was whether playing a gay man would kill an actor's career. Times and attitudes have progressed. View this from the perspective back then.
4,It's a Romantic Drama...,"...with gay highlights (pun intended).Saw this back when it came out (I'm pretty much thinking the counselors at the children's home thought it was a different sort of movies when they took us.Funny thing was, they were too stunned to get us all together to leave before it was almost over. Didn't change anything; I'm still a breeder), and one of two things that stands out in my memory is Harry Hamlin being touted as some sort of 'blonde' guy who the fem and the...other fem fight over AND the music. The music sounded like the soundtrack to 'Carrie', what with all the flutes and soft lilting fluff. Gah.But I also remember it was a pretty touching drama about discovery and also the damage discovery can do. But it really is too 80s to bring back, like 'Blue Lagoon' or 'Beat Street'. Leave it be. Make a new one. Hell, remake this one. Otherwise, people will be laughing at the bad fashions too much to gain any insight."
3,Worth reading.,"The description of Mrs. Mary McCray as an adult in Montclair, New Jersey and her struggles for ""full freedom"" are truly inspiring. I felt as if I was sitting in that kitchen listening to the anecdotes as they were told. I found the early part of the book, however, to read like a research paper with the footnotes included."
3,More on action then there is with a plot. Great chase scene.,"The plot is nothing to talk about, but Bill Hickman does it again with a great car chase just like the one he did in ""Bullitt""."
4,Terrific Action Movie with a Top Car Chase Scene 1973,Too much gratuitous violence. Plenty of exciting action in this film. The film contains one of the best car chase scenes of all time. The viewer is just glued to the TV watching this entire chase. This movie was released in 1973 so that many of the special effects were done with stunt actors and not so much with computer special effects. I see this as a plus back to an earlier time.
5,Gritty 70's police drama,"Great flick from a time when these raw, gritty films brought people back into movie theaters after a long decline in attendance. Contains one of the definitive car chase scenes, shot live on the streets of New York City. Roy Scheider and Tony LoBianco turn in great performances. A great night of entertainment, and if you remember the New York City of the 1970's, before it was sanitized and primped for bored (and boring) suburban tourists cattle herding themselves through our once real streets with their shopping bags of overpriced junk, you will long for the time when the City was actually a real, working city - warts and all."
3,Great Movie,This is a great movie. 70s style cops and robbers. Roy Schieder is good in these rolls. He plays a detective who is a member of a team setup to capture criminals who will spend 7 years and up in prison. There is a great car chase in the film. Not as sleak as todays chase scenes but raw and captivating. Worth watching.
1,1/2 inch inlet,This has a 1/2 inch inlet which was conveniently left out of the description on this no return close-out. So many dummies and so little time.
2,"for ""completists"" only","the story is basically ""ten little indians"" in Spanish. It is OK but if subtitles are a turn off you might want to stay away, Franco has done much better, but you could do worse than this too. It is set in the middle ages and involves a will and a guy in a rubber mask who is killing of the heirs."
1,This Book Blows,"This book was very possible the worst thing written since anything by Danielle Steele. I have tried to read this book 5 times made it through the last time, wish I would have just read the back of a cereal box instead. Salvatore...what in the world were you thinking?? Please end this series here you are destroying minds with books like this."
3,Not A Book for Drizzt fans,"Upon finishing every book written by Salvatore on the Drizzt 'Do Urden series. I was really looking forward to all the Demon wars Books. When reading the IceWind Dale series and all others I never put it down and hated the fact I had to sleep because I wanted to read!! But with this Demon Wars series I found myself falling asleep!! It seems that these characters are based on the Band of the Hall. I just couldn't get into it becasue it was like I had already read it before! You have the main charcters that portray Drizzt and all of his friends, the story line is different and the battle scenes are writtten like wise. But to me it was the same and not as good. But because Salvatore wrote them I will try to read them anyway and reccomend them also, just don't get your hopes up!"
3,"Entertaining, but not thrilling","I'm a huge Salvatore fan, but I must say I was disappointed with this latest series. It's interesting, yes, but not very original. This story just strikes me as a re-hashing of a Drizzt book; you have your male hero, Elbryan and a heroine, Pony; a mystical connection with an animal, in this case a horse. An unusual assortment of characters; the centaur was a nice touch, and of course, the wise man, Avalon.The isle of the raining gemstones was creative and fun to imagine, but I felt this was just another Drizzt book by another name. I'll wait for the PB on the 2nd book."
3,The book was written in a hurry.,"I enjoyed the first half of the book much more than the second half. The action and emotion of the fall of Dundalis was sad but gripping. Overall, the book lacked detail describing good and evil characters. More than anything, Salvatore rushed it. Robert Jordan like ""over-describing"" isn't necessary but real likable characters i.e. Drizzt are (and I haven't even read all about the ""Dark Elf"" yet.)"
2,Too predictable,"This book is just like all of Salvatore's others. And that's not a good thing. I liked the Dark Elf books and the Icewind Dale books but they all had a formula-like approach to the story. Something bad happens to main character, MC goes off to become stronger, comes back and gets revenge. This formula worked well with the Drizzt books, but this endless use of a one time plot line makes his books too predictable, and too similar to one another. Salvatore has the potential to be a very good writer, if only he would spend some more time with his books and try to make them more interesting. Throw in some unpredictable plot twists, or some non-stock characters. Anything to give it a fresh feeling. In my opinion, once you've read one of Salvatore's stories, you've read them all."
5,Dinosaurs act up at bedtime too!,"This imaginative book features a large cast of ""real"" dinosaurs acting as naughty as real kids do when it's bedtime. I loved the pictures of exasperated parents as a huge brontosaurus throws covers on the floor or a tyrannasaurus rex runs around the room. My second grade niece, a good reader, handles the text with ease but isn't too old to be tickled by the concept. Younger siblings like this one too. Inside the front cover is a chart with small drawings of the characters and their scientific names--an educational bonus!"
5,A must buy for all children and parents,"We received this book as a gift and it has been a family favorite ever since then. We have also purchased many other books in the series, but still this is the best of them all. A great gift for others or for your family!"
5,My Little Dinasour Loved It!,This book is a part of our evening ritual with our 2 year old reading most of the pages to us. The illustrations are entertaining for old and young and the story is adorable! Our bedtime routine would be extinct without it!
4,"Great visuals, mediocre writing","My two-and-half-year-old daughter loves these ""How-To"" dinosaur books. I bought How Do Dinosaurs Go To School? first, which she was hooked on and triggered me to buy this one, which she equally loves. She can memorize and articulate the 10 dinosaurs names provided in the book, just as she could with the other dinosaur book, which also introduces 10 types of dinosaurs. However, while the illustrations are highly entertaining to a toddler, the language, like that in the other book, is quite lackluster. It would be ideal if the book also shed literary value and were enjoyable to read aloud to a child as well."
2,Inflicts guilt and manipulation,"My son was given this book as a gift. I was disturbed by the text. It makes children feel that they should just do what they are told like ""good"" little children. Children should be allowed to express their anxiety about bedtime, not just shut up and go right to sleep because their parents said so. Children ask for that one last drink, that one last story, etc, because they want to make sure their parents are there for them. They want to feel secure. Some children have a hard time transitioning at the end of the day and need those reassurances. That is why this book bothered me. I do think the illustrations are great, which is why I gave it 2 stars instead of one."
4,Cute book,Like this very cute story and bought it along with the stuffed animal which I think my granddaughter will adore.
4,Toddler Friendly,My son loves this book and loves to read it several times a day. The pages feel flimsy and tear easier than I would hope.
5,Works Great,Still using the product and it still helps my tattoo from fading. I wish they sold a bigger bottle of the item.
3,"OK, but there are better...","This book is ok, I guess, but I have few criticisms. First, there are too many black-and-white photographs, making it hard to appreciate the pictures. Second, the text often gets out of sync. with the pictures, so you have to flick back and forth between text and pictures. Third, the book is just too small for the pictures it displays. I recommend ""Songlines."""
5,Mind Blowing,"This is a truly great book about a truly mind blowing development in the otherwise tepid (and too often phoney) world of contemporary art. Most of the artists represented are in my view among the greatest I've ever encountered, from any time or any place, anwhere. The fact that their work projects ancient traditions in a manner both faithful to those traditions and at the same time so original and vital is truly mind bending. Caruana's discussion of the work and explication of so many interesting and important details is highly instructive and enlightening. I recommend this book unequivocally to anyone with an eye and mind open to the possibilities of art and the power of symbolism."
5,Explaining the intricacies of football strategy,"Although this book was written about a generation ago, it does an outstanding job of explaining the intricacies of football strategy and contains many fascinating anecdotes about the National Football League up until the late 1970's. I am reading this book for the second time."
3,Frighteningly funny for anyone who was raised in the Midwest,I loved it. I was shocked by it. Frankly it hit a bit close to home. The characters are vivid and cartoonish yet familiar. I found myself wanting a little more from it but it wasn't a disappointment either.
5,Genius,"To be honest, the first time I saw this movie, I hated it and could not wait for it to be over. But since I bought it, I forced myself to watch it again so I could get my money's worth. And now, let me tell you, I must have seen it at leat 100 times. I lost one copy and bought a new one.I have seen it so many times, that I believe that I can see through the comedy now and can fully appreciate what the movie is about. It took me several dozen viewings, but I almost see this as a sad movie...but still very funny.But this movie is pure genius and amazing. It will forever be one of my top three movies of all times."
4,OVER THE TOP,"A small town wants to celebrate its history with a small play. The town enlists the local dramatist (a very gay-acting but in the closet Christopher Guest). He orchestrates a grand production using a cast of misguided and none too talented locals (comprised of Guests&#65533;s usual suspects&#65533;Eugene Levy, Catherine O&#65533;Hara, Parker Posey, among others). When the production starts to come together they invite a New York theatre critic to the production (he would be Guffmann of course). Of course Guffman never shows up, and the cast&#65533;s lives go back to normal. The special thing about the movie of course is the journey of how they put the production together and the quirky characters that it took to get to that point. The directionless Posey as a DQ employee, Catherine O&#65533;Hara as the long suffering wife of a domineering man (forget the actor&#65533;s name but he is hilarious) with whom she runs a travel agency. Fabulous film, once more very character driven."
3,Memorable... but something of a disappointment,"After enjoying ""A Mighty Wind"" and ""Best in Show"", I was eager to see this earlier installment, but ""Guffman"" was not as funny, subtle or memorable. Certainly, if you are a fan of Guest and company, you'll want to see it, but anyone else might find it difficult to watch. There are some shining moments, but also some dead zones, like the climactic stage show. Think of it as a training film for the troupe."
2,Good enough for a rental.,"This non-scripted movie is good, but I wouldn't buy it. It's good if you like a lot of awkward humor, but if you're waiting for a big laugh get something else like Rat Race. The later movie with the same actors, Best In Show is more deserving to be in your collection; don't bother Waiting for Guffman."
5,Nothing ever happens on Mars..,"Superb movie... Corky St Clair (Guest) is a dancing revelation... Love the ""Remains of the Day"" Lunchbox.. Brave need more wampum to buy pelts"
5,Perfect size for a run,"I got this for my husband for his shorter runs. He likes it because it is very slim and does not create a lot of annoying bounce. He can carry his car key, credit card, driver's license, ipod and a bar in the pack. You can easily roll this pack up and make it very compact for packing. This is a great purchase for someone who wants to carry some small essentials on runs or hikes."
5,Excellent,"I read those reviews. There are a lot of good reviews. Just it for a ski. Works great. Don't expect to hold everything, but the essential things, like credit card, driving license, car key, a few bucks, a cell phone. Will try it for a half-marathon run later this year."
3,Not as Compact,I just received the item. It look great but I was disappointed about the size - I don't have a very large torso and I only needed a pack to hold a small cell phone and car keys. I wanted the pack to be small enough so it would not be noticeable under my shirt. This pack seems well made but I do not like the small 1 inch band or the size of it. It just did not work for me.
5,A MUST READ!!,This is a must buy/must read. The details are unbelievable and the storyline is very true.
4,Airline book,"Was interested in this because I, too, have trained for responding to a major airline disaster. Learned alot from this book."
2,Disappointing,"I found this book to be quite disappointing, juvenile and unbelievable. The characters are irratic and the story line overdeveloped in some places and underdeveloped in others. Example: if a wealthy New York bachelor is trying to impress his affluent next door neighbor with a house warming gift, he most likely would bring something from Tiffany's, not a MacIntosh Yankee Candle. And what world class Manhattan hotel would have a gift shop that contained both emerald earrings and a section of Christian fiction? If I were you, I would pass on this book."
5,Book I ordered,This was a very good book and in excellent condition. I was very pleased with my purchase.
4,Awesome file set,"I recently took up modeling again, a hobby enjoyed in my child hood. I have found thses files indispensable! The various sizes and shapes make filing down nubs and modifying parts a snap. Even though they are inexpensive, they are of good quality and I know they will last me many years of modeling. The plastic handles help to give you a good grip on the file for delicate tasks."
5,Great set of files.,Best files I've used for plastic models. The three files that are included are all fantastic to use and have a precise use. They are all useful for certain things.
5,New Look at the Company Man,"This is an extremely entertaining book about corporate life, telling three interwoven stories. These describe the difficult professional life of the protagonist, Ward Wittman, who is a senior executive at a troubled high-tech company; the tense but sometimes supportive interaction in his affluent family; and the role women play, and refuse to play, in meeting Ward's emotional needs. This final theme is sure to interest many readers, who will enjoy the selfish and immature Ward describe his triumphs (and failures) in bed. While Ward is not a lovable character, he certainly is familiar and sympathetic and tells a great story about ups and downs in life. A fine final chapter! One suggestion--in Cooper's next book, I hope he spends more time on the fascinating character of Jimmy Schuster, who appeared--albeit only briefly--in his first novel."
2,Disappointing. High expectations: Huge letdown.,"Being pregnant with a rare type of identical twins (monchorionic/single afterbirth), I had high expectations of this video. I paid for extra shipping because my husband and I wanted to watch it so badly. VERY disappointing. This video does not focus very much on the actual science and miracle of twins. But rather, the studies on homosexuality of one twin verses heterosexualism in the other. It went off on a huge tangent about this study. Don't waste your money, plan to catch it on tv for free so you can only watch the parts that ARE ACTUALLY about twins instead of their sexuality theories."
3,Two for One,"Maybe I've watched too many ""In the Womb"" shows, but somehow this one was not as interesting as ""Multiples"". I was expecting much more information on identical twins."
3,"inexpensive, attractive, adequate quality","The item was as expected. Points to consider:- the fabric is tightly-woven so the wind blows the hammock around like a sail, unlike the open weave variations.- the canvass is equally taught side-to-side across the wooden bars, so you do not so much sink into this as ride it. A good boy scout could fix this.- can hold a large group of kids at once."
3,Phil having Fun,"I don't think this one measures up with some of his other efforts. This album came across as ""Phil and his Buddies getting together for a jam"". Nothing wrong with that! There just isn't the depth of a Beyond Nature, find Me in These Fields, or Way Back Home here."
5,Classic!!,"If you are looking for an introduction to India that goes deep below the surface and yet does not fill up pages - this is the book. This book is a classic and no review will do full justice to it.The book is organized geographically and for each of those regions Keay gives us a view of the people, culture and tourist places in that order of importance.People seem to be of most importance to Keay and perhaps rightly so. All important ""types"" of social groups are described along with ""how"" and ""why"" they are unique. The ""types"" are according to region, caste, religion or sect or a combination of these. Culture is also described vividly and contrasted well and somewhere in this history is put in to give a perspective on things.It is a highly recommended reading among books on India in English language and tourists and students would benefit alike from it."
1,FAKE FAKE FAKE,"THIS IS NOT JEWEL KILCHER SHE HAS NEVER DONE A ""FLAVA MIX"" FOR ALL YOU JEWEL FANS OUT THERE DO NOT BUY THIS!"
4,"Chew it for 14 minutes, and then spit it out","This gum is really sour right when you bite into it, but after about15-20 minutes of chewing it, it gets kinda grainy, almost like a pithy watermellon, and starts to disintegrate in your mouth. Totally wierd. It's good while it lasts, though. If you're looking for a gum that lasts long, go for Bubble Yum."
4,Mop Top is a boy that I can relate to,"This book is one that I enjoyed when I was young because I also hated to get my hair cut. There was something about sitting in the barber's chair and having my hair manipulated that disturbed me. Even decades later I still find it difficult to sit in a barber's chair, it was only when my wife started cutting my hair that I became comfortable with it.Therefore, I could always empathize with Mop Top (real name Marty) as he finds many other things to do on his journey to the barbershop. His thoughts and actions were identical to mine when I was given fifty cents and told to go to Ivan's barbershop. There were many times when a scouting expedition was sent out to look for me, as I seemed to have fallen off the face of the earth. This book is some comfort to all young boys that have developed a dislike to having their hair cut."
5,A Wonderful Addition to a Ship Modelling Library,"Philip Reed has long been known for his superb miniature models, He has finally published a step-by-step manual of his modelling techniques, recorded during the building of Majestic, a 74-gun ship-of-the-line. While Mr. Reed builds to smaller scales than many modelers (typically 1/92 scale) the techniques he uses would be suitable for any scale. The book is composed of 385 black and white photos with brief captions that cover the construction of Majestic from hull to rigging complete with realistically furled sails. Also included are eight color photos of the completed model. Mr. Reed's photographic skills are superb and one cannot help but marvel at the model as depicted on the front and rear covers. Ship modelers in general and admirers of superb miniaturist Donald McNarry in particular, will surely want a copy of this book for their library."
3,Best of EARLY Illapu,"This is the best of EARLY Illapu. The songs on this album are mostly older, more traditional Andean songs. It is quite different from their later recordings which have a much more mature and unique sound such as ""En Estos Dias"" and ""Morena Esperanza."" This is not the very best of Illapu, but it does have some classics such as ""Candombe Para Jose."" I own it because it is a good alternative to buying all of their earlier albums. For more traditional Andean music I would prefer the group, Kollahuara or Quilapayun. Illapu's greatest is their more modern fusion that uses many elements and instruments of Andean music along with sax, electric bass, and other more modern instruments. Also, their more recent works are much deeper lyrically and musically and have more layers of vocal harmony and instrumentation."
1,Not worth watching,"This home-made-movie style rehearsal presentation is of poor quality and most certainly not worth the 20 viewing minutes or $24.95 price tag. The rehearsal of the grand pas de deux was routine and the instructions for dancer improvement was given in a very muted Russian, which made it useless for non-Russian speaking viewers. Watching a rehearsal should be instructional as well as showing the viewer the immense hard work the dancers put in to learning their roles. I was greatly disappointed."
2,Not worth buying,I rented this thinking I might learn a thing or two. I was wrong! the barre my teacher sets is more difficult than what the students here demonstrate. There is also a rude student who kept disrupting the teacher. Center work is beyond simple as well. Nothing fancy. I was disapointed.
4,Detail Far Beyond Books - Makes You Want To Be There,"I have backpacked many national parks over the last ten years, and my normal routine is to buy a topo and a book to plan my trips, in addition to hitting various web sites. I backpacked and dayhiked some of the trails mentioned in this DVD about two years ago. This title was definitely beyond what you get in a book! In combination with the photos, the narration really gives you extensive detail of the hikes. I was surprised with how much more info was packed into this DVD than I gleamed from the books. In fact, I picked up on some things that I missed when I was there in person.Given what it was designed to do, highlight the trails, it did this task very well. I would have liked a few more scene selection options, and maybe some more overview maps but all in all I would highly recommend this title to anyone planning a backpack or hiking in Yosemite."
3,Thorough but not compete,"The calculations which are furnished with this CD are well documented with both references and explainations of the method. Unfortunately, some of the references are quite out of date (ASCE 7- 93 vs ASCE 7-98 for wind loads is a big difference). Also, of all the possible structural calculations only a very limited number of calculations are presented for such an expensive CD. It seems to be a good tutorial by example for a new user of MathCad."
5,an odd cd,when i was a dj i found this odd cd and listened to it and was both delighted and horrified but what i heard. it was rockabilly fit for a texas chainsaw massacre movie. but the record proved to have staying power with catchy and mournful songs. i went out and ordered the cd later i was impressed that much. it stayed in my cd player for a week.
3,Eh...,"This is my second Eco-Drive and I was looking at quite a few of them before deciding on this one. I like the watch, but I'm somewhat disappointed. It looks nice and all, but there are two features that are completely useless. I don't necessarily need to utilize 22 different time zone settings. In addition, the 24-hour and UTC hands are useless as well. I bought the watch simply because I'm in the military and I wanted a nice watch to wear in uniform. I appreciate the fact that it's completely blacked-out, but there's no way to see the digital numbers at night. Therefore, I might have been better off if I had purchased a really nice Timex with Indiglo."
1,Don't buy this rat! The other ones are better!,"I love the Stainless Steel Rat! I want it made into a movie! I think he is one of the best ""thief"" characters ever created.However, this book stinks like sulpher on a hot day in Hades. It is the worst sequel since Highlander 2. It's boring, moves slow, and has little of the humor and adventure associated with the series. Do yourself a favor and re-read an old favorite SSR and skip this one."
2,Painfully Mediocre,"There is very little in the world worse than watching a favorite author write well below his potential. The four previous Stainless Steel Rat books I had read were all full of acerbic wit, tight action, and amazing (yet credible) escapes. This one is lacking in nearly every category. With every page, I was desperately hoping that Harrison would break out and regain his form. Alas, it was not to be."
4,Raymond Carver's Minimalist Prose Provides Maximum Impact,"Raymond Carver's ""Fires"" is a quick introduction to the author who personifies literary minimalism. In this slim volume, the reader is treated to essays and poems, as well as Carver's trademark: taut short stories that, in remarkably few words, paint a vivid tableau of so much of American life. Carver's subjects are ones that other writers shy away from: working-class stiffs and the mundane lives they lead. But Carver's magic lies in his ability to fascinate the reader with seemingly unfascinating topics. The characters' souls are bared, the torment of their lives is revealed, the desperation of their economic situations is rendered so masterfully, and in so little space, that the reader marvels at how Carver manages to accomplish the feat. For students of the writer's trade, Carver offers a valuable lesson in how to use minimal syllables for maximum impact."
1,First experience with Stella Cameron,"Not what I was expecting - way too focused on the contrived sex scenes and not enough on building character. Found myself skipping just to get to the end and find out ""who done it"". Not recommended for serious mystery fans."
1,Too bad the plot wasn't as good as the sex scenes!,"This is my 2nd book by Cameron. I really can't tell you why I read another one. The plot was difficult to follow, the main character was idiotic at best....Do I really need to go on? On a bright note the sex scenes were well written and pretty easy to follow. If only the plot had done this also!"
5,"""Thrilling Whodunit"" ...","""The Good Sister,"" by Diana Diamond, keeps her readers guessing until the very end in this thrilling whodunit. An exciting tale of two sisters...one, a murderous sociopath...the other, convinced that the other is trying to kill her. The characters are believable and well-developed, the dialogue moves along nicely, and the plot will have the reader screaming for more. A recommended novel...."
1,Disappointing,"I love most of the Dara Joy books, but this one was most disappointing. This book was full of make-believe words and flat/shallow characters and fell short on plot development and ability to hold your interest. Might be an acceptable bedtime story for a 4 year old, but not much entertainment value for an adult."
4,Excellent futuristic book,"The futuristic book was excellent! The more I read it, the more I wanted the book to never end. The possibilities of great sequel stories, is outrageous!! I hope she will follow up!!"
1,couldnt hold my daughter up,"My daughter is 3 years old, her Chest size: 20 inches and her weight is 26 pounds, so we bought the small size. The first thing we noticed was that the vest was too tight, and she felt very uncomfortable and was barely breathing. I thought that it would be different in the water. It was better in that sense. She could breathe - even though it was too tight, but she COULDN""T FLOAT!!! I had to use arm floaters instead. What a disappointment! What a waste of money!"
2,"Mixed Review - Lots of Bugs, But Lots of Information","This book is driving me crazy! I'm up to page 564 and I find several more bugs in the examples presented. Since the book does not include a CD with bug-free working examples I am really tempted to knock on this book. It also frustrates me when an author prints source code that clearly has never been tested. But despite all the bugs, the book is fairly well written and covers many topics. It does a good job of explaining Java development for Windows, but is really poor at describing Java programming for platform independent applications. But then again I find Visual J++ to be a very poor development tool for platform independent applications. For that, purchase Borlands JBuilder 2 (it's a much cleaner environment). All in all, the book presents a lot of material in an easy to understand format, but don't expect many of the examples to work the first time. You will become an experienced Java programmer through the process of fixing the authors code."
5,Great Collection,"This is a great collection of great films; particularly Other Men's Women - we watch it over and over. The story, acting, the cinematography, and the trains are spectacular."
5,"Great Pool, but not that easy to fold up","I give this pool 5 stars! It is not easy to fold up at all! It does not deter me from using it. You blow up a small ring & it fills up fast. There is a plug underneath for draining, but it works better if you prop something under the pool next to the hole for more efficiant draining... otherwise it drains very slow."
3,Not as good as I hoped.,"I bought this pool mainly because we are short on storage space and I liked the idea of how it folds flat for storage. As a mother of a 4 year old and a 1 year old, I am somewhat saddened by the pool. They love the pool. I would have preferred a different one. It is hard to get the sides to stay up and I find myself pushing them up more than enjoying my kids playing."
4,"Plants fighting back, who'd have thought.","Imagine, plant chemicals didn't come about for our medicinal use but instead as a defense mechanism. Wow! Ms. Sumner gives an Interesting and novel look at the how and why flora developed compounds in defense of those who would use them as a food source. Provides insight and understanding of prey predator relationships between plant and insect/animal. Also, there is much information relating to the history and lore of Medicinal Botany."
5,Kiss me Goodbye,Sally fields is very funny along with her co-stars.Intresting movie from beginning to end. Never get tired of watching it.
3,good example of an ill-humored comedy,"This movie will appeal to all those who like ""wickedly funny"" comedies and to those who have been hit by a divorce that was not of their choosing or by the breakup of a relationship that was against their will and have had to watch their ex-spouse or their ex-lover find somebody new and become happy again. This movie sticks it to the new guy in every possible way, including portraying him as a stiff, dull nerd. What a neat revenge!To all others, this movie is a waste of time and money."
5,Useful technical book,"Lots of design ideas, ground work for your own inspiration. Great pictures and use of various materials."
2,Not ewerything is good on DVD,"This is not a DVD with quality. The Concert from 1975, but quality far from that. I recommend to turn down the sound look at the TV-picture. Turn on the audio CD of ""The Journey..."" in orginal. That's help!I'm Sorry! I'm not supriced!"
3,Not bad but not great.,"This Super Brawl was held on April 9, 1997. This event as two tournaments and a Superfight rematch. In the Middleweight tournament is Brazil Open veteran Maurice Travis and rookie fighters in Leonard Carter, Pat Matsuda and Jason Pili. This was interesting but I did not care. In the Heavyweight tournament is UFC 6 veteran John Matua and rookie fighters in Lance Gibson, Bob Gilstrap and Peter Matautia. Good tournament but was not great. The Superfight was a rematch from Super Brawl 3 match between Danny Bennett and Jay R. Palmer. At the last fight Bennett kicked Palmer's head in the 15th row of the Blaisdell Arena. This fight was ok but not as great as the first fight."
2,This is NOT WCW's 1994 Pay Per View!!,"This is a shootfighting tape based on UFC style fighting, including several UFC stars, and it is a very violent, but short tape...Do NOT Buy this tape if you are looking for professional wrestling....This is martial arts at it's goriest!!Very short, not really worth buying..."
1,In a hurry to publish,"I have read every single Patterson book. Obviously I'm a Patterson junkie. However, this is not typical Patterson style or writing. I hope the new book offers true Patterson performance and not something that can be whipped out in a few weeks."
2,Please don't spoil it for others,"I normally love reading the reviews - it helps me decide on a book when I'm going back and forth on my decision to buy it. Although I already knew I wanted to buy 3rd Degree, I checked out the reviews. A few posts ago, someone completely gave away a MAJOR twist in the book. I shouldn't even say ""gave away"" because that might mean they hinted at it and I figured it out -and that would be alright. But no, they flat out said what happened in the end. I seriously couldn't believe it.Everyone is entitled to say what they want, but this section is called ""Reviews"" and not ""The Ending of the Book"". Please put ""SPOILER"" in your subject if you're going to insist on giving away the endings of books."
1,This thriller has no thrills,"What began as an interesting premise in 'first to die' has denigrated into an abyss of banality. Nothing in this book is remotely original, and there is never a thrilling moment. With almost more chapters than pages, this 'quick read' is not worth any investment in time."
2,"Well, it was better than the Lake House.....","but that's not saying much. It did keep me mildly interested, but I'm very glad I got it from the library rather than spend money on it.After being unable to even finish The Lake House I swore I'd never read Patterson again, but decided to give him another chance. Sorry I did....If this series keeps deteriorating in the same direction book 4 should qualify as a Harlequin romance."
2,Boring & Predictable Thriller,"I have to agree with the other review that rates this book as lackluster and poorly written. I haven't read the others in the series, but since I wasn't real impressed with this one, I'm not rushing to buy another. Instead, I am re-reading the Jane Whitefield books by Thomas Perry; which offer a much superior series of thrillers."
3,ok!!,ok i am not a huge fan of this murder club series..............i love the ALEX CROSS books more............but none the less.........3rd degree is a consistent book in the series..........maybe not as good as the previous books but still good......
4,I JUST LOVED IT!,"IM NOT A FAST READER BUT THIS BOOK I READ IN 24 HOURS,I COULDNT PUT IT DOWN.I FEEL WHEN HE WRITES WITH ANDREW GROSS I ENJOY THEM MORE. I HAVE TO SAY I WAS VERY DISSAPOINTED WHEN ONE OF THE MAIN CHARACTURES WAS WRITTEN OFF,BUT IT STILL ENDED UP BEING A GREAT BOOK AS WERE THE FIRST TWO.IM LOOKING FORWARD TO READING THE FOURTH BOOK. KEEP GOING WITH THIS SERIES EVERYONE IS TALKING ABOUT THESE BOOKS."
3,Okay,Not as good as the first 2 books in the series. It was sad. It find.t hold my interest. Looking forward to book 4 in the series.
4,Some articles quite good,"The articles in this collection range from weakly-argued screeds to well-researched, well-written critiques. I found the articles on Chomsky's work in linguistics and his involvement with neo-Nazi holocaust deniers the strongest and most interesting. You don't have to agree with every word in this book, but it is definitely worth reading."
1,a negative personal attack ad in book format.,A series of vague and clearly motivated by something not mentioned in the book. Horowitz is insane.
1,proof of anti-Americanism?,"The idea of attempting to ""analyze Chomsky's intellectual career and the evolution of his anti-Americanism"" is not much of a goal to set out on. What exactly does ""anti-Americanism"" mean, beyond a paranoid way of saying ""political critique of one's own country""? Using the term ""anti-Americanism"" as if it means anything is dangerous, as has been demonstrated by the history of investigations of un-American activities. Not to mention that Chomsky's critiques extend past America to other countries, first and foremost, Israel. The only valid use of the term ""anti-Americanism"" which I can imagine would be to refer to people elsewhere who blame all problems on Americans, and fail to see their own contributions to problems and those of their governments. But to use the term when talking about an American citizen, who clearly likes some things about this country (the dude still lives here!) is ridiculous. Critiquing government policies is never anti-American."
1,Spineless,"Collier and Derschowitz, a couple of lefty turncoats, who haven't changed from their Leninist ways, just in who pays their bills.It's hard to say any more about such nonsense as this. I don't always agree with Chomsky, but I have always found him honest, and intellectual to a fault.The authors of this tract, obviously envious of someone with intelligence--intellectual capacity so far beyond theirs that they're like a different species than he--do no more than lie, and provide this kind of third rate propoganda.Grow up boys."
5,Accessible Information,"This is a well written book that not only includes information about brain-compatible learning theory but also, specific implementation ideas. It turned out to be an excellent place to introduce myself to this fantastic teaching method, with just enough background to explain fully, but not so much as to be impossible to understand. It also includes many resources for further study now that I have a basic comprehension of the ideas."
1,Cat Women of the Moon,"Crikkey, is this an awful film. Not as awful as, say, ""Revenge of the Mutant Tampons"", but a possible runner-up. I only purchased the DVD to listen to Elmer Bernstein's score."
3,G-rated,Cute guys but like most books in this genre the title misleading suggests more erotic pictures than you will actually find. Most of the guys are wearing briefs. You can see about as much on prime time television. But again the guys are cute...just don't expect a grand erotic experience.
3,Very good but could be better.,"This book give a good historical background of the Bargue method and a passably good description of the course itself, but the master drawing examples are mostly too small to be very useful."
4,For the Classical Artist at Heart,A must have in your drawing resource or go to book for the serious artist in classical drawing. M. Tostado
5,A Redeeming Testimony of Faith and Love,"It's been a VERY long time since I've picked up a book to read and found myself unable to put it down until I had finished the entire book. As an avid reader of non-fiction, I surprised myself as I became consumed by the story line of The Ultimate Betrayal. Although one of its many themes is quite provocative and sensuous, I certainly would not classify it as a 'romance novel' by any stretch of the imagination. Ms. Jones has skillfully woven a story line which seamlessly transports the reader into the realities of a painful yet spirit-filled and ultimately redeeming testimony of faith and love. The accompanying soundtrack is also a powerful complement to the book and another reflection of Ms. Jones' gifts as a writer and musician."
4,great show and great CD,"Elton John? Elvis Costello? Billy Joel? Meet the future: Ben Folds!!Well, it's hard to tell if Ben Folds in the longtime will be such a peculiar artist to be included in the R&R Hall of Fame just like some of his most obviuos models, nonetheless he is a true original performer and songwriter and this live exhibition is a fine opportunity for everybody who missed his studio albums. The best songs of the Ben Fold catalog are here, the only weak moment is when Ben covers Elton John's ""tiny dancer"": alas he seems unable to reveal something new of the song. Nonetheless this is a fine effort and Ben shows a lot of courage too: I don't know how many performers out there could stand the test of a piano and voice show, Ben Folds can.The limited edition CD - coming with a bonus DVD presenting 7 songs and 3 of them aren't on the CD - is a bargain!!"
1,"The beeps are more obscene than the ""naughty"" lyrics","It's my own dumb fault for not realizing that there was a ""clean"" version and an explicit version of this CD when I bought it at a store (Amazon does label it as ""clean""). Why don't they put a ""CLEAN"" label on the CD cover the way they do with ""EXPLICIT"", so that those of us who'd rather hear the ""F"" word instead of an annoying beep will know to find the explicit version? I love the performances, but the beeps are so distracting and intrusive that I am going to have to buy the real version. This sort of censorship is ridiculous, and serves no purpose."
2,doesn't hold air,Right out of the box there was already a small hole in the pillow so it doesn't stay inflated. It would be great if it didn't leak.
1,Won't blow up,"The valve to blow up the pillow with air came out before the pillow was entirely inflated. The valve was not secured in the pillow and would not seal so air leaked out immediately. If I would have known this would have happened, I would not have purchased the pillow."
1,Deflates within a few minutes,"I have had two of these pillows now, and after a few weeks they both started leaking. Air starts bubbling out of the pillow immediately after it is inflated, and it is completely empty within minutes."
3,Not Exactly What I Expected...,"Okay, to start off this review I just want to say the the pendant is VERY small. Tiny, in fact. Plus, the front of it has the Azurite stone set in it, which is good, however, the pendant has no back to it AT ALL. It is only the front that has the Azurite stone set in it, yet the back is bare. Overall,I was/still am disappointed in this product and would not advice anyone to buy it unless, of course, the aforementioned product that I received is exactly what they are looking for."
4,Fan does what it's supposed to,"Fine product, one problem. I got it to replace an existing ""Nutone"" of the same model (678). My original from who know's when (80's maybe) mounted between the studs, this one mounted to the stud requiring some carpentry in the attic to build out the stud to where the hole in the ceiling was. Wish there were options to choose which style of mount I wanted.The fan is working so much better than the old one tho! I love it."
5,Totally out of left field,"I bought these not knowing they were flats, just looking for something beefier for my 7 stringer tuned GCGCFAD and this was the solution.The strings gave off at first what I thought was a warmer sound, but had this little twinge brighter than the EXL110-7 set was a perfect balance and way better with the low tuning, not a single problem with Tension.The flat strings also helped make the strings a little more manuverable.And this is the heaviest guage you can get without mixing and matching sets."
4,Enjoyable lite read,I found the book to be a nice read on one persons adventure down the Mississippi. It is not a great American novel like some of the other reviewers expected it to be. It is one persons account of his travels and his transcriptions.If you are interested in learning a little bit about the river and even more about the diverse cultures within our country then I would recommend reading this book.
5,An amazing journey,"I read this book because a girlfriend recommended it. Now, I don't usually like the books she recommends but she nagged me to read it so I did. And I'm glad I did.I have to say, this book is without a doubt, one of the most engaging, humourous, thoughful, interesting books I have ever read. It seems to span a whole lot of different genres, being like a cross between 'Trainspotting', 'Siddharta', and 'Gullivers Travels'if you can imagine that.The author takes you through some pretty confronting scenes of drugtaking, wierd sex and all kinds of things without ever it seeming like he's trying to 'wow' you out. It's like he's just telling the story, and an amazing story it is too.I strongly recommend it."
4,Great Memphis Music,"Keith Sykes has always deliveried Memphis music at its best. In this CD you can feel the fun it must have been to record each track. Simple, yet tight Rock and Roll with a touch of the south.It is a shame that Keith's earlier works are not rereleased on CD."
5,One of my favorites,"This is one of my favorite Twila Paris albums. It's got a blend of styles; some slow, some more upbeat. I can't think of anything of Twila's that's disappointed me; and this album is no exception.Probably my favorite song on the album is ""I Will Listen,"" from whence the album's title was taken. The duet with Steven Curtis Chapman, ""Faithful Friend,"" is beautiful, too."
5,Does everything but make you a sandwich,"Seafoam is one of the few products I can recommend and that I actually use in my own vehicles. It's such a multifaceted product. Not only does it clean carbon deposits of of both fuel injectors and carburetors, it stabilizes fuel and prevents the separation of the ethanol, and it removes moisture from the gas. It's great for your car and its also great for small engines which are much more sensitive to gas separation and moisture. I use this stuff on lawn mower I repair and it really makes a difference."
2,Ba bye $10.64,"First off, I never heard of Seafoam before. Someone had suggested it on the Gold Box Forum when I started a thread about an issue on my car. Because lately, my car needs to be revved (two minutes minimum) in order for my RPM to reach at least 1,000 if not, my car would sputter and die down. So after spending time watching youtube on how to apply this product. I gave it a shot, little did I know not only did it not solve my problem, it also, turned on my check engine light.I would have given it one star but I'm sure it cleaned the carbon out of my motor even a little. So now I have to resort to cleaning my Idle Control Valve and hope that will solve my problem. For the record though, this is the first and the last time I'll be using this product."
1,I couldn't even get it off of my dog!,"I was so excited about receiving this harness. We were planning on using it when we go to the beach next week! I received it today and put it on my dog. I took a picture and sent it to my husband. After I sent the picture I tried to take it off but I couldn't get it unsnapped. I ended up having to make it larger and pull his front legs through the back side and slip both circles over his head. Not a great experience! I am in the process of trying to return it! I will not be exchanging, that's for sure!"
4,Pink Dog Harness Special Price,Got this for our ShiTzu who weighs about 15lbs. This one is easy to fit and fits perfectly. The release buckle is a little flimsy but appears to be holding it's own. The price was right and didn't set me back the usual 16 plus dollars at the local pet store. Would definitely buy from this vendor again.
4,"Nice harness, great camo design.","This harness is a little stiff , I have a poodle terrier mix about 30 pounds, and fits great, but not soft as the last harness he had...color of the blue camo is perfect...."
4,Good Book,"I really like this series. It's about four, well after this book five daughters of the moon goddess. In these book Jimena, Serena, Vanessa, Catty, and now Tianna each have a special power to help them battle the Atrox, an ancient evil sent to destroy hope. Vanessa can become invisible, Catty can go back in time, Serena can read minds, Jimena had premonitions or she see's stuff that happens in the future, and Tianna can move tings with her mind. These books are all about their battles with followers (people who have devoted their life to the Atrox) and many other forms of evil. To find out more I highly suggest these books. They are really good!"
5,Another Goddess Joins the Daughters,"I really liked Tianna's story, though not my favorite book in the series, I liked it a lot.Tianna wakes up one morning with no memories of her past except a small note. She is being chased by followers and has a special power of her own. Telekinetic powers. The other daughters soon notice this. They continually try to help her, but she is unwilling ans scared. Tianna also manages to find Catty in another dimension. Can she bring her back? What's planned for Catty, Tianna, and teh rest of the daughters? Find out in Lynne Ewing's The Lost One."
3,A good new character,"I enjoyed reading this for the reason that it was a new point of view for these books and characters to be seen through. Although, the viewed seemed, in the end to be pretty similar to the other books 'Vanessa the pretty popular one, Catty the artsy one, Serena the smart talented one, Jimena the tough one' And now introducing, Tianna, the sporty one. Sort of the like some Spice Girls/Sailor Moon hybrid.Even with her amnesia etc, it doesn't explain to me why Tianna changes which guy she likes with and without her memories. And how does she have powers if she is not a a Daughter of the Moon to begin with, but gets adopted into the fold?My nitpicking aside, she was a strong character, and her confusion was much easier to follow than that which Serena experience in book 2 (I think that' the right number)One of the better in the series overall, but the ending was a tad too cheesy."
3,Give this CD a chance ;-),"The few selections offered here don't do their music justice!I met the members of Winiaypa in 1995 and heard them play on the boardwalk at Venice Beach California, I fell in LOVE with thier music! There is a truly magically quality to thier instrumentals - although I must admit I don't much care for their singing. I bought their CD that day, it is entitled;""Sueños - Los Chacras Vol 3 - Music From The Andes"". If you ever come across this little gem, GRAB IT! ....;-) You'll be instantly transported to your ""happy place"" by the lovely haunting sounds of harps and pan flutes. (You get the feeling I like this music? ;-) I'm picking up this CD today, I'll probably skip the over their singing, but you always have to dig to get to the buried treasure. ;-)"
2,It's just foam folks!,I never got to use this because the Lasko humidifier I bought it for kept leaking no matter what I tried to remedy the problem. After it developed mildew all throughout the unit I threw it it out. I'll use the foam replacement filter for padding in something.
3,Sometimes it's the little things...,"I was reading along happily, wondering if a lot of the sex scenes were gratuitous but otherwise without complaint; then, three quarters of the way through the book, Julia gets into her Baker Electric, dons goggles,grabs the wheel, then can't hear the conversation over the roar of the engine.No ""roar"" in an electric car, no goggles required, no steering wheel (a tiller, instead.) Well, that was it for verisimilitude for me. I had already questioned a couple of things the author wrote about the Panama Canal, but this clinched it. The era was insufficiently researched. Like the author, I just rushed through the next 40 years, disappointed."
4,"A ""women's book"" with some decent history thrown in.","If you enjoy historical fiction with a romantic thread, you'll probably enjoy Lois Battle's STORYVILLE. Set in New Orleans during the Women's Suffrage marches, it's a pleasant break from the standard ""gothic romance.&quot"
4,Bought for myself for Christmas.,"Great book. Don't do much rope work, but really enjoy this book. Bought this one to replace one lent out and never returned. My original was bought in Las Vegas at Lance Burton's shop."
4,Very good resourse,The Electrical Engineering Library is a very helpful source of information for me
1,a novice vc ++ database programmer,"The title of this book should be called Introduction to VC++ database programming. After reading this book, I'm very doubtful that one can write a VC++ database program.The narratives on the code samples listed in the book are poorly described. As a programmer, I would like to see samples on how to use the VC++ tools to generate MFC database code.In many cases, it has a lot of architecture pictures and descriptions of various database facilities in VC++, eg ADO,RDO,ODBC API etc. If one would like to read about these facilities, he/she can get the write papers from the Microsoft Developer Network on the Internet easily."
4,"In general, a good book","This book is one of the few that gives you a C++ approach to ADO for accessing databases.While I'm semi-comfortable with the Windows internals (thanks to Richter), I came into this book with zero knowledge of COM and the MFC (I'm from the Unix world). Knowing MFC and COM would help immensely, I was still able to get my C++ database up and running within about four hours with this book.I'd prefer a revised version that tosses out the MFC and instead does I/O with iostreams. If you can filter the MFC stuff out, the basic information seems to be there, and the book paid for itself on it's first day."
1,WHAT A WASTE OF MY MONEY,The code doesn't work ! Half of the book teaches you SQL. IfI had wanted to know how to write SQL statements I would have boughtanother book! I am being more productive with Microsoft's Tutorial. The minimum rate is 1 star but I'd give it -5 stars. The negative (not even 0) is due to the waste of my time also !
2,The Life of A Shadow Warrior.,"As many before me have already said, this books title leads you on to think it's a historical account of who and what Special Forces are all about, but instead it turns out to be an account of General Carl Stiner affairs in and around the special operations community. Other than a misleading title, the story is incredible. The title of the book does this American hero no justice and as you read the reviews you can see what I mean. I would have given this book 4 star if I had known what I was getting."
2,Hmmm. Time better spent doing something else.,"Shadow Warriors reads more like a history book or even a biography of Carl Stiner. This book is less about special forces than it is about special operations. Without dimishing Mr. Stiner's truly laudable military career the book is well, boring, probably I went into it thinking that it would be about special forces and that Clancy had actually written at least part of it.How many pages can a person spend discussing the in-depth hostage negotiations and logistics of a single airplane hijacking without any actual action taking place? Apparently quite a few because it goes on and on ad nauseum. I lost interest and started skimming the book about halfway through. Actually, just like I'm losing interest in writing this review since I haven't even finished the book. Long story short: unless you're really interested in a history lesson of how special operations planning has evolved over the last 60 years or so then you should probably skip this book."
4,US Army Special Forces - the story told through one veteran,"This book tells the story of US Army Special Forces through the voice of the author, GEN (retired) Carl Stiner, who traces the formation of the Special Forces from the decades of the 1950s through his initiation into SF in 1964 and follows his remarkable career over more than 3 decades, including the Achille Lauro hostage rescue, the invasion of Panama, and operations Deseret Shield and Desert Storm, culminating as the second commander of SOCOM, the US Special Operations Command, from 1990 to 1993. This book is a very readable history of army Special Forces that follows the career of one of it's most illustrious ""shadow warriors"", a true quiet professional, and Tennessee native from LaFollette, Tennessee."
3,Kind of disappointed with this Clancy non-fictuon novel.,"When I first picked up this book, I thought it was going to be a great inside of the Special Forces, but I was wrong. I love Clancy as a fiction writer, but non-fiction is not really something Tom Clancy cannot do to well. Sure the book starts out good, but it slows down with the history of the Special Forces (I am a HUGE history buff, so I didnt mind Clancy explaining the history.) and it kind of crashes and burn.The book could of been much more better if Clancy would of brought some more action into this book, but he fail to do so, and so I was very disappointed, I did finish the novel, and it just made me realize that Clancy better stick to fiction than non-fiction. Sorry Clancy, this was not my cup of tea."
3,Not up to the usual Clancy standard,"If you read ""Into the Storm"" and ""Every Man a Tiger"" and were expecting a repeat - don't. This is not even about Special Forces. It discusses the career of General Carl Stiner and a few others, but does not focus on Special Forces. It does provide some interesting stories about the US invasion of Panama, Carl Stiner's tour of duty in Beirut, and a few interesting adventures from the Gulf War, so it is not a total loss, but not something that I would recommend."
1,The worst,Product came on time. We have Cervical problem. We wanted to try some instrument for neck exercise. This product is not engineered good enough to do the job. Two clips on the hanger does not stay in proper position. Strip that holds front and back flap is too short. If you stick the flap firmly then it chocks the wind pipe (My wife had terrible experience) and if you leave loose it slips through your head. too risky. I called the customer service within 2 weeks or so about the problem. He said I can return the product but i will be charged 10% restocking fee and all the shipping and handling. Beside all this product that I received is not safe and I think I have to complain to food and drug administration about this product.
2,Spurts and sputters,"The flow is good from this valve, and the 1/2 turn action is nice.But unless there is a hose attached you won't like it. It spurts and sputters.We'll be replacing it."
2,Was disappointed in the quality of the CD,"Pedro Messone was my reason for ordering the CD, however, the 1st song ""Si Van Para Chile"" was of very poor quality sound-wise. I guess I'd have to describe the sound as ""warbly."" The remainder of the CD was adequate, but not necessarily on a par with others I've bought from Amazon.com"
1,You have to be kidding,"So, He gets crucified and then they carry His body to France?And of course Mary Magdalene must be in this gnostic cult too. Ok, what about the fact that His tomb in Jerusalem was sealed with wax, and there was a Roman guard guarding it? ok...they were in on this too? And, every apostle but John was killed for this FRAUD. Would you die for a fraud? Boiled in oil, skinned alive, hung upside down, clubbed to death, fed to the lions, etc. etc...on and on! For a lie....I don't think so!!! Get real people those bible codes are able to say anything you want them to say.... Do you people really believe this mess? He's God? But He can't get out of the tomb? I think you people had better get with it...you are being deceived by a master deceiver....And you laugh at Christians for having faith that He rose from the dead. You'll do anything to try to destroy Jesus, won't you? He wins....You lose. Read the Bible!!!!"
2,Not so sure about this book for beginners!,"There are many other better books out there for beginners. Just because this say's DBA 101, doesn't mean it is for beginners. reading this book was very difficult as I had NO knowledge of Oracle and it was very confusing. After reading other books, that are far better, then picking this one back up then I could understand, But why? getting knowledge from other books, you won't need this one. Lot's of definitions of oracle parameters, Not enough real examples and very logical in nature, not practical at all"
2,2 and a Half Stars,"This is a dull entry in a dull series. I thought the first Pumpkinhead was a masterpiece, the second I thought sucked quite frankly, and this pushes the still going series back to respectable. Here the Puritan aspect is played up in the sets and costumes, combining fantasy with real life to create like a celestial feeling. I would recommend this to see once or twice, but it doesn't come close to the masterpiece the first Pumpkinhead was. Though it is a lot better than the awful Pumpkinhead II Blood Wings. I kinda liked it, it's not bad."
3,Not the best Mikado,"The quality of this DVD is disappointing, both in video and audio. It IS a clever production, but the flaws are too great to make it a real joy, even with Eric Idle. The Stratford Festival production is a much better DVD."
2,"Despite its great score, this production isn't worth seeing.","The Mikado is a wonderful show with a witty, hilarious score, but setting it in 1930s England was disturbing. The actors bothered me (although I usually love Eric Idle), the make-up was repulsive, and the camera angles were distracting. This version of The Mikado is not worth seeing."
2,blank (silent) spots,"The DVD is defective. It's annoying to listen to a musical number, and watch the singer move his/her mouth soundlessly. I think I'm finished with Amazon, and I hope you enjoyed this review."
5,Nice for younger children.,"I bought this for my grandson, he loved it. Said ""it was just what he wanted"". I think he is a pretty smart young man."
5,My daughter LOVES this,"My 9 year old got this for her birthday and just absolutely loves it. She's made squishy crystals, and an underwater volcano. She can't wait to do more of the activities. I would definitely recommend this kit, I think I'll even look for more like it!! =)"
4,Great toy for curious little minds!!,"This science kit was wonderful for our 3 year old. She was intrigued by the chemical reactions and various color changes in different experiements. We tried every ""short experiment"" the first night. Most of the experiments were simple, exciting, and took a few minutes to set up. However, there were some that we never tried because the results required several hours of waiting between steps and our toddler doesn't have that much patience yet (I'm sure a lot of you can relate to that!). In summary, I feel this was a great purchase, but keep in mind that some of the activities require an extended amount of time."
4,"Fun, but messy","I have had a wonderful time doing the activities with my 6-year old. She loves it. What I do not love is that for [...], they couldn't send test tubes that didn't leak. No matter how carefully and tightly you put on the screw caps, fluid will dribble right out. So when the activity calls for shaking to mix the food-coloring tablets or the red cabbage juice powder, you had better make sure you a) are wearing old clothes and b) standing over the sink. Again, I really like this product and would buy it again, but it is extremely frustrating that for this much money the apparatus it comes with should be so problematic, since you cannot even lay the capped tubes on their sides with any type of liquid inside them."
2,Kind of Fun - Kind of Boring,"THE GOOD: The science behind it is good being an educational toy that is. It kept my son's attention and he completed a quite a few of the projects.THE BAD: Gets boring too quick. Received as a gift for Christmas and was played with only once. Kind of feel we could have con-cocked the same things in the kitchen with vinegar, baking soda, etc.OVERALL: wish we did not purchase, would not recommend."
3,Neat Kit questionably worth the $,"My son (4+ years old) is enjoying this kit quite a bit. That said it is a fairly simple collection of very common kitchen products, the ""experiments"" could be replicated with a few dollars worth of products. It is collected and packaged nicely and the booklet explaining them steps things along nicely but I'm not sure it's worth the price of admission."
1,Seriously????,"We're only about 15 minutes into this movie and I'm already thinking, ""I'm glad I didn't pay for this."" (I Tivo'd it from cable.) Other reviewers have called it ""cheesy"" which is an understatement. We're all for a good, cheesy sci-fi flick, but this is astonishingly bad. To be fair, it does have entertainment value - we're cracking ourselves up making fun of just how bad it is! No continuity of accents (hilarious), horrible graphics (loved the plasti-head decapitation), and expecting a ""wardrobe malfunction"" any moment now... the characters with the most depth are the horses..."
1,Ugh!,"Where to start. It was nice to see Jonathan LaPaglia (Frank Parker from ""7 Days."") Other than that, the movie was horrible. The acting and dialog was very nearly painful to endure, and as for the special effects...I think the Teletubbies had more cutting edge effects than ""Attack of the Gryphon."""
1,Never worked out of the box,This didn't even work out of the box. I followed the instructions and..... NOTHING! It's not even worth the effort to return it and I'm sure they were counting on that. You get what you pay for. Thankfully my expectations were very low due to the price.
4,"Great shape, good book.","The book came in great shape. Whoever had the book before me, thanks, your notes are helping me! Homework is getting done, thanks!"
1,Abysmal,"This book was hideous. The only book that I have reviewed on Amazon that I hold in as great disdain is the ""Ayes of Texas"" also by Daniel da Cruz. As is true with the other novel this book is so full of clichés, stereotypes and impossible science to make even a callous reader become nauseas.Basically Texas is an independent country and must fight those evil Russians who control the rest of the world for all practical purposes. Come stage center Ripley Forte, billionaire, playboy extraordinaire. What a cad. This book is terrible. Please, Please save your money."
3,TONY IS BACK,"It is a new / harder program, but not as enjoyable or the same quality as the original P90x. Seems like it was thrown together to just make money, or compete with competitive products."
4,"A bit childish, but a fun listen.","This is definitely bubblegum pop, but that's okay, because the girls know it and are not trying to make themselves feel grown up by singing about unnescesary things that they have most likely never experienced, like they have on past albums. My favorite song on this album is probably Hand In Hand, but I also really like You Found Me. I avoided listening to the Hard Knock Life cover for the first month that I owned this CD, but I finally did listen to it and I like to listen to it occasionally now.This CD is an improvement from their earlier albums in that it's not an attempt at sounding grown up. It's fun to listen to when I'm on long road trips or just feel like having fun."
3,I expected better...,"~I have always considered Play one of my favorite bands... ever since the first CD was released. Although they still did a fine job in ""Don't Stop The Music,"" I expected better from this band. Yeah, there are a few good songs... ""Evergirl"" and ""Girls Can Too"" were my favorites. The other songs weren't as catchy as the last albums.I prefer their second album, ""Re-play"" to this one. Although Janet is a pretty good singer, the band lost some of its spark and strong vocals when Faye~~ left. So if you are looking for an okay CD with a few good songs and some boring ones, this is the perfect CD for you. Otherwise... try ""Re-play"".~"
2,"Not one of their greats, but a typical, topical '40s comedy.","This military comedy is Laurel & Hardy's answer to Abbott & Costello's ""Buck Privates."" A lame script doesn't do Stan and Ollie justice, but there are a few howlers (including an ""inspection"" scene with Laurel stashing a crow down Hardy's pants). A good supporting cast of familiar faces helps. The video transfer is excellent."
2,Way too messy of a routine for me,"This isn't funny to me: Hi, I'm a comedian and sometimes comedians do this kind of thing or that kind of thing, and I'm going to do this kind of thing right now. That is essentially the kind of humor you will find on this album. It doesn't work for me because it dissolves any pretense of spontaneity. Katz brags that he has been doing comedy for so long that he's not at all uncomfortable ""working the room."" He then proceeds to ""work the room."" Some of the jokes and set-ups are good, but he keeps ruining the routine by commenting on what he is doing as a comedian, and talking about what he used to do as a comedian, instead of actually being funny in the moment that is being recorded. He's at times either trying too hard or not hard enough, and this fragmented approach to comedy doesn't make me laugh."
1,Buyers Beware,"I am giving one star to this DVD set to bring attention to the quality of the DVD set. People have reported major sound issues, and others have reported video corruption of episode 24. You may want to do a little research on this issue before ordering. As for the show, I love it. It was what got me started watching anime. I would give it 5 stars if the quality of the DVDs were up to par.BTW, most of the high rankings given by others were for the show and not the DVDs. The DVDs were release 7/15/03. Look at the date of the reviews before making a judgement.Don't get burned. Good luck."
3,A warning about audio quality,"This is meant to be a quick review. This product uses the original Japanese audio for the episodes, and it is quite poor. This is not the NA production company's fault. Basically, the audio sounds like it was ripped from a VHS tape, and honestly I don't know why the original series had such poor audio. The show came out in the early 90's and I have seen clips of the show on Japanese sites and the poor audio is there as well. Other than that, I have no qualms with this collection."
5,FADE TO HELL...,"FADE TO BLACK- Dennis Christopher plays a troubled nebbish w/ an obsession for old movies. One day he snaps, causing him to go on a murder spree against all who have wronged him. The cool thing is his method of dressing up in full make-up / costume (Dracula, mummy, cowboy, gangster) in order to deliver his twisted version of justice! HELL NIGHT- Linda Blair stars as one of a group of HELL NIGHT pledges that must spend the night in a legendary house of murder and horror. Of course, things go awry, and the group is stalked by a homicidal mutant! Blair gets to do her best Jamie Lee Curtis impression, and actually pulls it off nicely! A great Saturday night / Halloween double feature..."
3,Just ok,I came accross this product at a local TJ maxx store and decided to try it. First of all i have dark skin like Mary J Blige complexion. The instructions say to apply to cleansed skin for 10mins then rinse off and use 2-3x per week. I tried following the prescribed method and wasnt seeing much difference. So i began applying every night as a lotion (didnt wash it off)and i think it would work this way with consistent continued application. I have seen very small improvement but it is working much slower than i had hoped even with increased and intensified application. So overall just ok.
2,Classics country comedy,"I thought there would be more time with the comedians, but at least they were more family oriented than today's material."
5,Good product,"I got this product because I had problems keeping up with the good quality of the water for my fish. This products helps with the circulation of the water on the bottom of the fish tank, air is pull to the bottom and the water goes on top and its filter.I also have the regular filter, and I advise to keep it, I think the regular filter helps filtering small particles and stops from coming back to the water. The undergravel filter will not do this, but it will avoid your water to have excessive ammonia and circulate the water from the bottom of the fish tank.The tubes looks nice with the bubbles going up with the water. Just note that if you are planning to buy this product you need to remove every single rock/gravel before installing then you put them back of course."
5,Hopefully the next perfect mix,"I was so happy when i called in to my local music store and they told me that my cyclone mack C.D. had arrived. I anxiously placed it in my car C.D. player and had the ride of my life. I enjoyed every minute of this C.D. The lead singer was awesome, and the background vocals just blended. Unfortunately, i live too far away to enjoy this in person and i hope that if they ever come to the L.A. area i will have the opportuinty to be front row. Their sound has continued to grow with me in the last week and i play it often.I hope the big guys and critics pay attention to this group as they contiue to grow. I will gladly turn on their music to my friends. Special thanks to the bass player, Jeff. Thank you for turning me on ......to your band."
4,Guidance for any person struggling with his faith,"Excellent book for any serious person, trying to find answers to his personal struggles. Suffering, loneliness, guilt and pleasure are discussed in a reasonable and potent Christian framework. Let you wondering how you did not understand it before. This book makes a great asset to any library."
2,Hard to Stay Interested In,"I read Ravi Zacharias in Joe Gibbs ""Game Plan for Life"", which by the way is an outstanding book. In that book, I really enjoyed the way Mr. Zacharias wrote, it was a great entry and he talked like I could understand. Now I am not a scholar, but I'm not dumb, but to me, this book was all I could do to get through the first chapter awake. Not to mention had to keep a dictionary close to understand all the 50 cent wording he uses. I guess if your looking for a thesis of higher intellect and you can understand all the boring comparisons this is a book for you. Me, I really like Dr.Tony Evans style of writing.....I can understand the man because he speaks like he's from this century and like average people carry on in conversation. Definitely a book for an experienced reader, not the average Joe.Good Luck to all reading this book....hope you're up for the challenge, it's not for me."
3,I'll admit.....i didn't use this one right. kinda tough.,"I could never master this book. I really just liked reading it because of the procedure. I used it in conversational settings to make myself look smart. Yet i never solved any problems...even my own. I['ve given up on NLP cause of my inability to INTERPRET the meanings given to each NLP thought or action.... i was never able to really get it. So i just used this as a way to let time pass in the laundromat. I tried using it for sales, but i could never get into it with the energy necessary. be well.cK"
1,Only partially functional,"Wish I could get my money back! I'm not sure if it's the Windows version that is of such poor quality, or if the Mac version is also bad, but this thing only seems to function if you have a 'standard' DVD movie, and select all of the default options.I allowed it to update itself 'to the newest version' and afterward it was even less functional!"
1,Don't waste your money on this,"My complete is the same as everyone else, this product out rightly LIES on the packing, claiming that you can rip your DVD movies to your ipod. Sure, if it's none copy written you can, but that excludes, well.... all of my DVDs.Don't waste your money on this"
5,great idea,"Th is a nice real I use in my garage with a hot/cold hose bib attached ,the leverage to reel in is nice and it looks cool too"
3,The Baby,"I remember seeing this movie,(having seen it twice) in the 70's at our local drive-in. Back then it was some movie, and as I STILL remember it, it still is. To this day,I haven't seen anything like this! To quote ""The Video Movie Guide"", ""Extremely odd film about a teenager who has remained an infant all of his life(yes, he still lives in his crib) and with his insane, overprotective mother. Eerily effective chiller is entertaining, though many will find it undoubtedly repulsive, and rediculous"", I couldn't beleive it was re-issued again. This is truly, one hell-of-a remarkable story! I highly recommend it! (In spite of the Mad TV skit.) Get it!"
5,Awesome times two!,"How can you go wrong with two great movies from the eighties? You can't! Both classics in their own right, this is a great DVD with a good dose of comedy...times two."
1,Feelings - copyright problems,Yes there are copyright issues. In 1988 a French composer LOUIS GASTE succesfully sued Morris Albert.The songs Feelings is very similar to a song called POUR TOI from 1956 by Gaste.Gaste was awarded 88 percent of the royalties
2,Morris Albert/Feelings CD,"Gentlemen:I have been impressed with Amazon since I began using it to buy books and music several years ago, but this Morris Albert CD you have on sale here is False Advertising. Please look at the songs listed on the back of the CD and then look at the songs you have on your cd ""song list"" under the product description. They are completely different. PLEASE CORRECT THIS because after reading all the reviews, a lot of people have bought this CD (including myself) believing it was something else.This Morris Albert ""Feelings"" CD is NOT the same as the Morris Albert ""Feelings"" LP released in 1975. Save your money!"
1,WHERE DO I FIND THE ORIGINAL 70s FEELINGS?,"WHY IS THIS CALLED ""FEELINGS"" WHEN IT'S NOT THE ORIGINAL??? I WANT A COPY OF THE ORIGINAL. DOES ANYONE KNOW WHERE I COULD FIND A COPY? PLEASE EMAIL ME AT bbdb@gateway.net"
1,A swing and a miss,"Here's the deal, kids -- if you have never read any Larry Niven, go read almost anything else he has ever written or collaborated in writing or even done an introduction for. Do that, and the odds are really good that you'll wind up reading everything he's ever written, and find yourself haunting the bookstores and logging on to Amazon daily hoping he'll write something more for you.Read this book last out of all the things he's written.If you've already read everything else he's written, then you might as well read this and have that feeling of completion.OK, it really isn't all that bad -- but Niven is a great writer, and other things he's done with Barnes have been very good (I have not read any solo efforts by Barnes)and so this one is just so TANJed disappointing."
3,Stepping into a Painting,"This was enjoyable and engaging. Niven shows us a key part of Known Space, pulling us into a story that becomes reality as we read. I found myself seeing the world, however briefly, as a land where a drug can increase awareness and intelligence, but at great cost. This is the goal of every artist- not to paint reality, but to make reality for the viewer and reader. Although this was a short story, and lacked a great deal of depth, it is encouraging to read that rare case of a Christian existing in the future, and a protagonist at that. This book is finely crafted science fiction, both believable and pulling the reader in."
4,Great as a guide for creating your recordings.,"The book consists of scripts you can use to create recordings. The scripts are written in the third person (eg. ""you are"" rather than ""I am""), which makes them easy to record without editing. The scripts are pretty good and make a good baseline for creating your own scripts/recordings."
2,A waste of time,"This is not what I expected, I was looking for strategies on various ways to hypnotize myself. This book contains statements that you can record on a tape and play back to yourself at a later day. This much I already knew and have done to some degree using various software programs.So, the question is this, is this book worth your hard earned dollars? Not really IMHO, I think there are better free software programs (Do a Google search on brain waves) out there that you can use and you won't have to listen to that awful voice of yours while you stumble over someone else's ideas of how you can be great. All in all, I expected more and I got what I wasn't looking for."
4,make it sleep,My daughter received this for christmas. She loves it. We only have had one problem. Learning how to make it sleep. We figured it out from the manual really quick.
3,cute...,I just got this. Is there some way to stop it from moving and making noise...I just want to use it as a speaker???? The noise from it moving almost drowns out the music...and I have a nice MP3 player.
4,I - CY is a good buddy,"It's a 1st generation product so there are less features than it's successors (I - Dog, I -Cat). Would prefer a switch that deactivates the animation during audio playback. All in all it's a cute little distraction."
2,Cute but not for extended use,"I got this little penguin for a gift since I am a linux guy. Its cute.The speaker is about what you would expect. Not great for music. The earphones sound much much better than the speaker in the little guy.The Dancing is not constant. He will stay still for some time, then wiggle around for a few seconds, then stay still again. The lights on his chest are just random patterns. They don't match the music beat.The movements create this little mechanical noise that is actually pretty loud, almost as loud as the music. And he 'squaks' abit.Its a cute thing for my desk, but I don't actually play music through it anymore. If you want it for a cute nic-nac, then I love it. If you need it to actually play music, then not so much."
4,Best The Rasmus Album,I am not a fan of The Rasmus but this CD is the best of themMadness- 9/10Bullet- 7.5/10Chill- 8.5/10F-F-F-Falling- 9/10Heartbreaker- 8/10Smash- 9/10Someone Else- 5/10Small Town- 8/10One& Only- 8.5/10Last Waltz- 7/10Can't Stop Me- 9/10
3,"Pleasant, but is it folk music?","The songs on this album are interesting and historic, and the liner notes are very helpful by giving the origin of the songs. For country-music fans, it is probably a great album. The editorial review refers to Ivy Creek Recordings as specializing in ""...authentic old-time music..."" Although the accompaniment on this CD is quite pleasant, it fails to give an authentic ""railroad"" or ""train"" mood. Some of the arrangements sound Hawaiian, probably due to the dobro instrument being used. I like my folk songs served up as folk songs, not oversweetened by the instrumentation or other means."
5,Beloved Classic,"I never stop laughing at this movie each year, no matter how many times I watch it! So glad its on Blu-Ray!"
3,Poor video quality-,"My family watches this every year and we love it, however, the quality of the movie was very poor. I buy from Amazon all the time and am usually not disappointed with my purchases. This was one of those disappointments."
1,We've Been HOODWINKED!!,"I already have the first DVD version of this movie. I gotthe 2-disc special for the widescreen version. Turns out,the widescreen version is actually a ""Matted Widescreen"".What's a ""Matted Widescreen"", you ask? That's the full-screenversion with the tops and bottoms cut off. You now get evenLESS of the movie. This dog is going back!! Warner Brothersdid the same thing to the latest release of National Lampoon'sChristmas Vacation, so don't bother getting it either. Wish Iknew who to complain to over at WB!"
1,Not even child friendly,"This movie is the opposite of a heart warming Christmas story, I was totally disappointed in it and got rid of it as soon as we got done watching it. I would give it a -10 if I could."
5,What a great movie!,"How many movies can you really enjoy with the young people in your life? This is one of the few. I watched this with great reluctance, and found myself absolutely loving it! Believe me, you really won't be nauseated! You will laugh!"
1,wrong format for my player,"This is a HD DVD and I have a regular DVD player. I did not realize that you needed a special DVD player to use this product. I tried it in a Blu Ray player thinking that it might play a prior version, but it does not work in a Blu Ray either. I wish this would have been noted in the product description that this product will not work in a regular DVD player. Return shipping price reduced the refund to less than $1.00 so I just threw it away."
4,A Christmas Story,I actually bought this Christmas present for myself and I just loved it. I always heard about it from other people but never saw it. I love Christmas CD's and have quite a collection for me to watch during a free time I have during the day. I watch these throughout the year as I will do this CD.
4,Pretty great!,"For a Christmas treat, my seventh grade teacher played this for our class and it was the fist time I ever watched it. It's basically about this little boy with glasses, imaginative scenarios, funny commentary, and the hope of a new BB gun for Christmas. Just to let you guys know, even if the grown-ups say ""You'll shoot your eye out!"", it wasn't a HUGE deal like it is today. I thought the story was pretty good, and the family and the mini-adventures they get into are hilarious. It has a nostalgic feel to it even if you werent around during that time period. I really liked it!"
5,Love it!,Christmas would not be complete without Ralphie and his pursuit of a BB gun. I thoroughly enjoy the ride every year.
2,Yet another DVD rip-off.,"Like so many people have so rightly pointed out and angry at,too, is that this classic receieved such poor treatment for the DVD format (I give the DVD two stars, not the movie itself). Bad picture quality, very few extras, and, of course, the biggest rip-off of all, it's in full-screen instead of wide-screen. Wasn't widescreen one of the main selling points for the DVD format? Of course it was! This particular DVD was only put out to cash in on the popularity of the movie without taking the time, care, and money to take full advantage of the format. Why buy this on DVD when you can get the same type of picture aspect-ratio and picture quality on tape? It'd definitely be cheaper!!"
3,"Great movie, of course, but the sound quality on video was really bad","Of course, I was really inexpensive, so I got what I paid for. Still enjoyed the movie!! My kids liked it too....although my youngest has the urge to touch his tongue to a pole...just to see what happened. Evidently he wasn't paying close attention!"
3,A Christmas Story,All time classic. Very funny. A must own-- except it is not available in wide screen version. Too bad. You can watch it in the cropped format on TV each year. Hopefully it will be released in a wide screen version soon.
3,You'll Shoot Your Eye Out!,"All what Ralphie wants for Christmas is a Red Ryder BB Gun. That's Right, He wants so bad, But His Parents, Teacher, and Good 'ol St. Nick Himself warns Ralphie Not to get it in this little slice of Americana directed by Bob Clark(Porky's). There are so many memorable scenes but my favorites were Ralphie's little brother gets his tongue stuck on the flagpole; Ralphie gets into a fight the School Bully Scott Farkus, and my best scene was Ralphie and Randy goes upstairs to meet Santa Hhimself-They started at the front of the line-But the line Began in THE other direction.The sore was about to close, and Santa was in a big hurry-Thanks to his Angry Elves(C'mon Kid-Hurry UP!) When Ralphie's mind went blank, Santa asked how about a nice football? Then Ralphie was pusheddown to the slide, and fell down into a pile of shaving cream. This happens to be a true Holiday Classsic. Don't Catch it on TBS or TNT; See it on TCM commercial-free."
5,A Christmas Favorite!,It wouldn't be Christmas without A Christmas Story! My children grew up watching this movie at Christmas and it has become a part of our family's holiday traditions! Love it!
5,"Well packaged, great quality",This was well packaged and of great quality! Great gift package and well worth the cost. Great experience and a solid gift idea.
5,A Christmas Classic,A great movie that my family adores! We watch it multiple times every Christmas season. We like this better than Rudolph.
1,Roku was down. Chritsmas eve. no servers available to watch it on got credit and charged again,never got tot watch it over holiday as roku was down and no streaming available. amazon gave me credit for purchase and charged me again for it a day later...I never saw the movie! I was working after Christmas...not home watching movies while putting up tree with the family.
1,LIKE IT,ALWAYS LIKE THIS MOVIE. I HAD IT ON VHS SO NOW ITS TIME TO UP GRADE TO DVD. I PLAYED THE VHS OUT. LOVE THIS MOVIE EVERYTIME. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS CLASSIC
3,Not in the same class!!,"This movie, some would say is right up there with, ""It's a Wonderful Life"". I have to disagree. Don't get me wrong. It's not a bad movie, but it's not that great. There are moments that are funny like the scene where the kid sticks his tongue on the lamp post in below freezing teperatures or the lead kid getting sent down the chute by Santa Claus. Other than that, it's at best, an average movie that serves it's purpose for the holiday. Good, but not Great!!"
2,Isn't a Christmas Movie Supposed to be Joyful???,"Ever since I watched this movie the first time, I cringed whenever it is broughten up. To me, I can't find an ounce of what Christmas really means. It upsets me to watch a movie where the whole time the kid is dreaming of shooting people. That doesn't create a very positive image for children today. I only seem to have this oppinion, while the rest of my family adores this movie. I can't stand to even listen to it! Not a great holiday classic in my eyes. The whole movie is made up up tense momments and things always get worse. It doesn't put a cheery image of Christmas in my head, at least."
5,Seller honest and helpful.,"There was an issue with this product, but it was immediately resolved by seller.Thank you, would order from them again."
5,You'll Poke Your Eye Out!,"This 1983 film is based on the short stories by Jean Shepherd (who also does the film's narration) and is played for twenty-fours straight on TBS around Christmastime. I've seen the movie probably a half dozen times before I found out that my parents had never seen the movie before. I bought it on DVD several years ago and made them watch it. My dad didn't care for it, but mom thought it was funny. I think every kid can related to what Ralphie went through just to get that perfect gift that he dreamed of."
1,"Nice, but not enough","First off, I will attempt to return my blu-ray disc of this because the audio and video are very much out of sync. The video quality is really no different than the regular DVD. BluRay doesn't add anything for this movie."
1,A Christmas Story,THIS IS JUST A CHEESE EDITED FOR TV EDITION NOT FULL SCREEN EDITIONMORE LIKE FULL TV SCREEN EDITION WOULD TELL A FRIEND TO BUY ITPLEASE WRITE AT LEAST 20 WORDS DESCRIBING MY EXPERIENCE - HARD TO DO WHEN YOU WERE JUST RIPPED OFF
4,Funny!,This movie is hysterical and really caputures tue Holiday season and makes you think that your family might not be as crazy as you think they are! Definately a classic Christmas movie.
5,movie was good and worked,Received Christmas Story in good shape DVD case was in good shape and movie worked. I am very satisfied with my purchase.Thanks
1,This movie sucks,I finally watched it and I hate it. Horrible and that little kid drives me nuts. Get rid of this movie.Sorry I can't stand it.
1,Poor quality,We were unable to watch this movie because the condition was so poor. We love the story and looked forward to watching this with our family during the Thanksgiving holiday
5,never arrived,this item never appeared at our door. shipper says they dropped it off. very disappointing.
5,A great classic!,We tried to buy this and it was sold out everywhere! I can't to watch it again this Christmas with my family!
5,a true classic,had to show the kids a great movie for the holidays and this is one of the best!!! will watch it again!!
3,Wait until its free.,"We watched it per recommendation of some visiting friends, its wasn't that great, and seemed more noisy than entertaining to me."
5,A Classic!,"One of the best Christmas, kid movies ever! Great writing, casting, and acting from everyone! I watch it at least once every Christmas season."
1,Don't Bother ordering,The video tape was totally unplayable. Voice lagged and was totally distorted in most of movie. Played one of my own tapes and it played fine. Bad product.
2,Poor quality,We were not able to complete the movie because of problems with Amazon's server. I double checked my Internet connections and all was working well. Even other movie streaming programs were working...except Amazon!Disappointing!!
3,A Christmas Story,Thought this was a kid's movie but it isn't. Profanity and risque insinuations. Funny for adults. Don't recommend this movie for children.
3,I didnt buy this for the great acting...,This is one of those movies i bought because i couldnt get it on netflix and i have a thing for conchita alonzo being the sexy vixen.i'll see almost anything she is in...at lease once.Blackhearted is a pretty much a by the book crime thriller that ends with the appropriate people being done in at the approrpiate time.
3,"CONSERVATIVE BIAS, otherwise great","When you write a textbook in economics you have the opportunity, the responsibility even, to apply the theory to public policy and everyday life. Landsburg does this in an informative and entertaining way but overall he treats liberals more roughly than conservatives. There have been times when liberals seemed more ignorant of economics than conservatives but that does not explain why conservatives get off so easily in this book. Landsburg simply prefers examples that fit his political agenda. Sadly, readers will have no idea that the examples were choosen based on their political value as well as their pedagogic value.Still, this book is entertaining, clearly written and teaches important material. If not for the political bias I would give it five stars."
1,crazy and disjointed,Didnt like it one bit. It was crazy hard to get into and jumped all over the place. Never really established a theme other than complete anarchy. It was a bad version of alice and wonderland
5,This book is a brilliantly maximal example of its genre.,"My first acquaintance with Lem was via The Cyberiad, which unlike any other non-Lem book had me laughing out loud almost once per page. While The Futurological Congress is also satirical, in that Lem tells the tale with just the right amount of insincerity to make the story credible in its framework, it also takes the genre of ""psychological sci-fi"" to an extreme. Picture Philip K. Dick to the nth power. I was incredibly amused, bemused, and provoked by this novel and would recommend it to absolutely everyone. (Also any other Lem book.)"
5,Accumulair Emerald Filter (MERV 6) (4 Pack),"Upgraded our A/C, which included a new air intake. Went from an easy to find 24""x24"" filter to a not so easy to find 23.5"" x29.5"" filter. Amazon had a good selection and for no particular reason I chose this one. Arrived quickly, and most important, it fits. Can't evaluate effectiveness, since I feel no different now then I did with the old system (although my electric bills are down at least 20%)."
3,Description from back cover,"Since there is no description here's the blurb from the back cover:From Indiana to a dangerous no MAN'S landJourneyman carpenter, Owen Hall -- killed in 1943 during an unfortunate accident at a railroad crossing -- finds himself resurrected thousands of years later in a world dominated by women. The men are all automatons, without free will or conscience.In just 24 hours, Owen wreaks havoc on this disciplined female civilization, turning it topsy-turvy by refusing to obey orders. But as his madcap adventures threaten to destroy their ordered world, the women realize that Owen's independence must be corrected...Suddenly Owen must use all his cunning and guile against a horde of determined female warriors if he is to stay alive ... with a mind of his own!"
5,A great bargain,"I take this supplement on my doctors suggestion to deal with cramping, and it works great. I used to buy it at a local whole foods market with a sizeable supplement area. Buying it online at Amazon saves over the cost."
4,"Not the highest quality, but very attractive","This is a very attractive dress. I bought it for an important party, and got quite a few complements on it. I am quite pleased with it.It is true that the work on the dress is not of the highest quality. The price is small enough to where I assume that the dress is only to be worn a few times (or perhaps once), and then disposed of. So, beware.But, if you know what you are getting, I think you will be pleased.(Review of Sophisticated Long Evening Club Cocktail Halter Dress with Draped Hem from Hot Fash Dresses - EMPRESS Black)"
3,Nice dress but not for me...,This is a nice dress but if you're heavier up top and a bra of any type (halter or strapless) is a must for you...I wouldn't suggest this dress. The dress comes up high enough in the back to cover the bra but it cuts low on the side under your arms so the bra is VERY visible. Not a good look. Otherwise it's a nice dress. The seller agreed to exchange or refund w/ no problem :-)
2,Only buy as a supplemental version,"If you do not have a recording of the Brahms 3rd, I would not suggest this CD to you. The performance is simply too eccentric. I would suggest Szell, Walter, Reiner or Solti. And if by some strange luck you find a copy of the long deleted Steinberg recording, grab it right away. It is a great performance. If you already have one of the above, this recording may interest you. It is a perfect example of how not to conduct Brahms. Despite, that negative comment, it does have some moments of interest but not enough to be your only version of a great masterpiece. The Strauss tone poem is pretty much a disaster because of poor orchestral playing. Again, I would suggest the Szell recording. Despite it age and analog sound, it is still hard to beat."
2,ZZzzzzz....Zzz...,"This could have been so much better. To begin with, the DVD goes off on environment tangents about brook trout, falcons, and other animals in danger of extinction. OK, that's great and all but I wanted to see the trail and what hikers go through day to day. Secondly, it completely blows over the Delaware River crossing, which is 80% of why I wanted to see it since I live in the area. Lastly, the music is just not fitting - sad, weeping violins and boring mandolin/back country songs play during otherwise positive moments - it really ruins the mood."
1,print explosion,Did not work for me. Turned out the software is too old for my new Mac. Just have to buy new stuff.
2,hard as a rock!,"My Son wanted this for Christmas, since he has a real weiner dog. But I am dissappointed in it because it is very hard, stiff, almost as if it has wire legs with stuffing around them, the stuffing was sewn into the seams and I had to pull it out before wrapping it because it just looked sloppy! It just doesn't feel soft and cuddley."
5,"Works great, worth the extra $$$",After going through a bunch of not-much-cheaper can openers we gave in and bought this one. My mom has had hers for years and it still works perfectly.
4,Arfur Magna,"I am not quite finished reading this book but so far I am impressed. I would have liked to see a consolidating map at the end of the book elucidating the narrative. As it stands the maps provided are piecemeal and difficult to put into the wider geographical context.The author's premise is a very engaging (a note here: this is a book attempting to put Arthur, Avalon and the entire cast in a geographical and historical context, not a history of the little people) mix of culture, politics, religion (both pagan and Christian), proposed historical inaccuracy, and linguistic detective work somewhat reminiscent of The White Goddess. Certainly I would like to do some of my own research before subscribing to a rewrite of English history, but I must say elements of this book have the ring of truth, if not common sense. Anybody at all inclined, or if you need to be inspired to visit Wales: read it!"
2,Take the coloring out,"I used to eat the wintergreen Altoids all the time, a tin a day. Today I bought a tin of wintergreen and I do not like the taste at all; I'll probably give them away tomorrow and try the licorice I bought, hopefully the licorice isn't changed :("
1,This book makes me not want to live,"I am a patient currently going through treatment for stage 4 Lymphoma, and this book was SOOOOOOOO depressing. Yes, it tells it like it is, and sometimes you don't need to hear that. And if that's what the book is about it, it shouldn't be listed as ""inspiring"", because the only thing it inspires me to do is give up the little hope I have. My copy is holding a lovely spot in the trash."
5,AMAZINGLY HORRIFIC!!!,"Wow, this is the most amazing DVD I have bought to this date. Not only was I stunned by seeing all of my favorite boogeymen, but they also included one's that I had never heard of but was morethan happy to have seen and been introduced to. The bonus materials were absolutely terrific. Hearing Robert Englund's voice still makes me quiver as I think of him as Freddy. This is a must have for any horror fan or movie fan alike. I just can't wait to see what these people come out with next, I'm sure I will be the first to order it!!"
4,I LOVE this DVD!,"This movie is incredible for ANY horror lover. It has so much to see, great commentary by ""Freddy"", the guess the scene game is one of the coolest things I've ever seen on a DVD."
2,It wasn't hat I expected in length or quality!Cheesy!,"Sure,It looks cool but looks aren't everything!Jason,Micheal,youknow!It was scenes from movies I have seen or have!I only haventseen the Ugly and I don't want to!I have all the Freddys and Hellraisers!If you expect them fighting in a feature lenghth film wait until August 15,2003 for Freddy Vs. Jason!"
4,good compilation/worth buying,"i wouldnt say these are the most frightening scenes from all the horror movies they have on this dvd but some are the most frightening like the hellraiser scene and the classic halloween scene but some i didnt think were the best scenes from the movies they had but it was still a good compilation and horror buffs should definetly get this dvd. it has cool statistics and surveys on it and charchter bios and trivia games for the computer and also on the dvd. it has audio commentary with robert englund aka freddy krugar and has a pop up facts along with the scenes and all the trailors to the movies. this is a pretty cool dvd, only reason i didnt give it 5 stars was because i thought that some of the scenes they had in there like the friday the 13th one could have had killing in it or a more memorable moment from the movie itself but overall this is a dvd worth owning if your a horror fan, its fun and has some great classic scenes in it. :)"
1,"""Terror in the [Video Store] Aisles""","I picked up this DVD because it remided me of an 80s flick hosted by Donald Pleasance titled ""Terror in the Aisles."" Compared to that, ""Boogeymen"" is just plain awful. The selected scenes generally lack any scares and come from some of the poorer movies in their respective series (Childs Play 2? Jason Goes to Hell??). The video quality for some of the excerpts is substandard, considering the fact that most of the movies' prints have been cleaned and transfered to DVD before ""Boogeymen's"" production--Texas Chainsaw is one example.Also, beware of the 5-star reviews here. I find it odd that they all have virtually the same length, written style, and end with a glowing snippet for the DVD. Perhaps the fact that they mention the DVD production company more often than not explains the bloated overall ranking for this product."
1,Horrible Compilation,"This is collection of what is supposed to be some of the scariest villains ever in movies, but the main problem is most of the clips are of not-so-scary parts. These may have been scary back in the day that they were made, but now, we have all been so desensitized that this compilation is all just something to laugh at how cheesy this dvd is. If u want to watch real horror, get the Exorcist or the Omen, both of which I cant believe were omitted from this."
3,Not made for women?,"I'm a woman with have average size hands for a woman and I find that the diameter of these handweights is just a bit too large for comfort. I can manage them, but I just wish I could get a slightly better grip. Other than that I like the neoprene cover which absorbs sweat and makes them skid less."
5,Good Weights,"These are very good handweights to add to your workout routines, I added the 5 lb ones after working out with the 2 Lb ones for awhile, still not strong enough to use the 5 Lbs all the time, but like 2 lbs the Neoprene cover is very comfortable to hold onto and prevents slipping when using these. Make sure to get the 2 lbs to begin with if you are not that strong right now."
4,"good, to heavy for me","These weights are fine and what I expected except for the weight. I don't have much upper arm strength, but I didn't think 5 lb. weights would make me extremely sore. I guess I should've gotten 1 or 1 1/2 lb. I was just wanting to add a little weight to tone up."
5,Great product.,"What is there to say? The product is exactly as advertised. Very few aesthetic imperfections on the weights. They arrived quickly - the day after I ordered them, I believe. I now incorporate these weights into my daily exercise routine. I couldn't be happier with my purchase."
5,Great and sturdy a bit heavier than I thought,This is great because it has a leather grip so you wont slip when you are doing the pushups with them.
5,Great for those who are getting back to exercising,"I used to work out on a daily basis (3x a week), but then due to an accident, I wasn't allowed to work out for 6 & 1/2 months. Sometime after my recovery, I searched for a pair of dumb bells that was a great deal. The Valeo 10 lb Neoprene was what I decided to purchase. The protective cover gives you a comfortable grip and doesn't slide out of your hand after a good work out like other steel dumb bells. It also prevents scratching your floor as well if you want to do bicep curls while watching TV. I'm one of those guys who want to gain some muscle and strength, but don't want to look like a profession weight lifter. The package comes with simple instructions on working out the areas of your arm. But it may be too simple for those who are just starting out, since the instructions don't tell you specifically what target areas you are focusing on. If you want specific instructions, then it will be easy to just search online."
5,Free Shiopping - durable weights,I've had coated weights before and found that if the coating peels even just a little bit they become quite uncomfortable and scratchy. These have been used a lot and have remained looking brand new. Free shipping makes them worthwhile but the durability - even being dropped and abused by my teenager is what makes them a really great product.
5,great addition to the routine,"These weights are just right. Great feel, great material. I've had great results and have used them for just about 2 months now, adding them to my routine about 4 times a week. They also came with a really nice instructional sheet (I didn't expect that) and it shows the proper movements for various exercises. I now have great muscle definition in my arms, not too much, not too little."
2,not so great,"my black bear hamster has already outgrown this cage in about a week. the spinny wheel on top is a flimsy, dirty nightmare. it's loud and wobbles off the base. taking the cage apart to clean involves taking apart everything and breaking a few pieces accidentally or intentionally, since they don't snap apart or together easily. i wouldn't recommend this to anyone, especially since i paid full price for it at petsmart! i am going to try a different crittertrail cage because i like the tubes. the only bonus i see is that my hamster poops in the lookout tower, which should in theory be easy to clean but in reality is frustrating."
4,Gerbils love this habitat,"My gerbils are sometimes too fat to get in the wheels of these sorts of habitats...not so with this habitat. Every single piece of the habitat gets heavily used by each gerbil. The one issue I had was a small broken piece in the roof. The good news about the habitat is that when a corner or small part breaks, it doesn't break the whole habitat. A lot of thought went into making this habitat. It's the best of the four I've purchased."
1,Don't buy this...,I purchased this cage for my daughter's first gerbil. We brought him home and set him up in the cage. 2 days later I came home from work to find part of his tail missing and blood inside the wheel. He managed to get his tail caught between one of the ventilation spaces in the wheel. We immediately returned this cage and bought a new one for him. He survived the ordeal and is much happier in his new cage! I would not recommend buying this page.
2,wheel,The wheel on this cage is a pain in the butt to clean i couldn't get it apart once it was together and my hamster put food in it at night and ran it makes a loud annoying noise.
1,Sample doesn't work,"The 2nd sample in this book, Calendar Dialog Application, completely doesn't work. When I compiled it, I got seven errors. So I give up to read this book."
1,Rip-off,"I had expected more from this set, but it's a joke. What's the deal with all of the CD's with only a couple of songs on them?? What a pain. Eminem is Thug music at it's finest, but this set is a rip off. Wait for the Greatest Hits cd--you'll be better off."
3,"EXCELLENT DVDS, but cheaper to buy individually","These are possibly the best DVD's any Dawson's Creek fan can own. Each season is amazing. I do find it cheaper to order the DVD's individually. I ordered them new from amazon, and ended up paying only $107 dollars for all six seasons plus the finale. Sometimes Amazon will have sales, like Buy One Get One Free, or they will mark the DVD's 50% off. Depending on how fast you want them will decide whether you pay the extra money or not. These DVD's are a must for any Dawson's Creek fan!!"
3,Love Show - Wish it had original Music,"I watched Dawson's Creek whe it originally aired and bought the box set too, I still love the show but I don't like that it does not have the same music it originally aired with, In some cases the music makes all the difference, imagine watching Star Wars without John Willimas Music Playing in the background, obviously it's not that bad, but if you are like me and watched the show you will notice a difference."
3,Awkward packaging,Love this show but the music is not the same as the original. Found a box set later that is smaller and cheaper.
3,One of my favorite shows groing up,"When 90210 started to lose its momentum in 1997 after the characters left college ""Dawson's Creek"" became the new show to watch about high school struggles. I used to idenifty with Dawson wanting to be a sucessful filmmaker because that's what I want. Pacey was the pimp on the show and all the chicks were hot."
2,Packaging needs work,"I bought this for my sister for Christmas and she just informed me that when she opened it, there were two stacks of 12 discs that were stacked on top of each other with nothing in between them. There was a peice of cardboard on just the bottom of each stack but that was it."
1,crap,"I bought this new and i have two disappointments..First, the original music isn't on the discs. And also, I have two Disc 11's, instead of a disc 9, and disc 11. How is that possible."
4,a little pricey,I thought this item was a bit overpriced but it was a gift for my daughter and she really wanted it. I couldn't find it in the stores. It arrived in good time as usual though.
3,dawson's creek on location?,"What does ""on location"" mean when the series is supposed to have taken place in a fictional town in coastal Massachusetts? At the very least, it should have been shot in Massachusetts. Filming in North Carolina is definitely not ""on location."""
3,Dawson's Creek the series,"This item was purchased for my daughter's birthday and she loves it, however the packaging was wrong and season 5 she is missing a disc so really it is not a complete series. Very disappointing."
2,Only for 80s addicts,"The production of Night in Heaven is probably more interesting than film itself. The film was written by Joan Tewkesbury and directed by John Avildsen so how was this 80 minute mess created? It's a bad film, but if you're a fan of 80s cheese, you might like it as a nostalgia trip. The music's actually pretty good. The only extra on the DVD is the trailer and what's interesting about the trailer is that it actually advertises the movie that Night in Heaven could've been. Another nice thing about the DVD is that the main screen features Bryan Adam's song Heaven. I'm not sure but I think the song appeared in this film before it became a number one hit."
5,So in love with Mazzie and Mitchell...,"I just saw the show on Broadway -- finally -- after months of listening to the album. The entire cast is spectacular which comes through on the album. Marin Mazzie and Brian Stokes Mitchell are spectacular and have the most heavenly voices on Broadway. Listening to this CD shows that...""I Hate Men"", ""Where Is The Life That Late I Led?"", ""Kiss Me, Kate"", ""Brush Up Your Shakespeare"" -- all funny, and the actors put so much life and emotion in them that you can laugh listening to the tracks. ""So In Love"" -- sung twice, once by Mazzie, then by Mitchell -- is so lush which only emphasizes the versatility of this fabulous duo.If you want to hear more of them, listen to either or both of the ""Ragtime"" cast albums. Truly special...Enjoy the album and DEFINITELY catch the show!"
3,Buy the soundtrack to the movie,"I'm a pushover for Keel/Grayson, so I suppose I'm prejudiced, but Grayson's coloratura floated much more in Wunderbar, and Keel was a lot better in Were Thine That Special Face. I suppose part of it is seeing it, so maybe if you see the production you'll enjoy the cd more. Marin Mazzie does have a nice voice, and I'm sure her fans will love this recording."
4,New orchestrations are revival cast album's undoing,"The 1999 Tony award winning revival of KISS ME KATE managed to show there was still life in this 50-year old show. Brian Stokes Mitchell and Marin Mazzie are ideal as a modern day Fred and Lilli. Amy Spangler has the proper saucy style for Lois. There was some (needless, though minor) tinkering with the book and the show's famous Overture was dropped. (That Overture must be jinxed: on both the Columbia and Capitol cast albums it was replaced by the Entr'acte. The 1987 London cast uses a new Overture.) The ""updated"" arrangements by Don Sebesky are no improvement on the originals, although the use of Elizabethan styled music for the Shrew sections is appropriate. The new recording includes more dialogue than previous releases. The production moved to London after its Broadway run and that edition was taped and has been released on DVD and is well worth checking out."
2,A cheesy 90's revival.,"This revival did not seek to preserve Kiss Me Kate as a museum piece, which in itself is not a terrible goal. However, in the process of 'modernizing' the score, Paul Gemignani has instead given us breezy, breathtaking tempos and jazz-inflected arrangements that turn this wonderful score into a cheesey musical revue. How sad, because this score in its original form was a landmark of American musical theatre. In fact this show has never received a decent revival, and the movie version of the 50's is so watered down and sanitized that it barely resembles the original show. If you can find it, I recommend the John McGlinn studio recording of the early 90's on EMI (now sadly out of print, but occasionally available on Ebay) which faithfully reproduces Robert Russell Bennett's original orchestrations and gives the listener a much better souvenir of Porter's masterpiece."
4,Tom Mix rides again hurraaaaay!,"Tom Mix Flaming Guns is a very fine picture from the good old thirties. It is funny, almost a western comedy and all the persons in big and small roles play with high energy. The title is not good though, there is not much gun play."
5,Classic Western,"Tom and the West are pictured here in great scenes that call to mind all the stunning glitter of his many publicity shots. Flaring Chaps, dashing ten-gallon hats, blazing six guns, and the wonder horse Tony with a wonderful background of western scenery: sagebrush, mountains, prairies, rocky buttes, and wide open spaces."
1,Loved the original- this can't touch it,"I read the first 50 pages, hoping the whole time that it would get better. I had previously read Central Park and really enjoyed it. When I saw a re-write of Northanger Abbey I thought that it would be a winner but the juvenile, overly simplistic writing style was extremely aggravating and annoying. I couldn't bring myself to read any further and waste anymore time bothering to find something worth continuing for. Such a disappointment! I'd recommend sticking with the originals. For Austen fans, the Gentleman trilogy by Pamela Aidan is quite good."
4,Excellent Music that does Little For ME,"There is no doubt about it. These guys are good at what they do in terms of singing and artistry. They have the talent and they has a sense of flair and style. It is just not of a type that does much for me. That is my problem, not theirs.The quality of the recording is good. The arrangements are well thought out. The singing is superb. What's not to like? The real answer is nothing. I just wish I had a better appreciation of it."
2,nature film,"A film about African flamingoes. It gives very little information. How old the babys are is never mentioned so there is no time relevance. Instead there is the rains filling the lake used as a gage but does not even mention how long that lasts. The shots are all along the same plane. The music is very uninspired. Contrasted to Baraka with its brilliant footage and a fantastic soundtrack this one does not come up very good. It is too bad these things weren't addressed, music, information, visuals, to make a better production. Possibly it relied on Blue ray to give impact which is really not enough to make the cinematic impression strong. Could have been more interesting on every level."
5,Couldn't put this one down.,"I am greatly impressed with the Mr. Marrs' book because it addresses, quite adequately, the question: how/why the media has so successfully and steadfastly ignored/dismissed/ridiculed the whole UFO issue since its modern inception in 1947. The answer comes down to the simple elements of money, power, control and manipulation. The book is more a history tome than a traditional UFO book. Any American who reads it will have his/her eyes opened wide. Mr. Marrs tackles the interesting question of conspiracy theories head-on, rationally, and quite successfully. For a thrilling fiction ride on the same subject, check out Alien Rapture by Author Brad Steiger."
5,Another Great Read from Jim Marrs,"If you enjoy your little, narrow, hum-drum views on everyday reality which the mass media spoon feeds the masses, then do not even consider this book. I have read several conspiracy-type books by different authors, and ""Alien Agenda"" touches on just about every view out there. ""Alien Agenda"" is an easy read, with an open mind, of course. You may read a chapter, then put the book down for a few minutes to contemplate what your mind has been programmed not to believe."
1,Incompatibility,"The most disappointing thing about Microsoft Works is that it doesn't ""work"" well with other applications. For example, the database tool does not appear to be compatible with programs written in Visual Basic 6.0. It appears that I now need to buy Access as a stand-alone product, when I feel that Works should be as useable as Office with Access. Half-star rating."
3,So you think this is Nietzsche,"To all of my fellow Nietzsche readers,While we may view this as a good book, it has some grey areas that should be addressed. There is evidence claiming thatNietzsche did not write this book, that it was published posthumously and that the publishers are the ones who completed it or something of that sort. This actually makes sense, if you read it and other Nietsche you will see that the philosophies addressed in previous books and this book seem a off and do not correltate with Nietzsche's other works. Just some food for thought, but enjoy non the less."
1,Very weak,"This is a poorly written book on the important subject of race in politics. Carter spends the entire book blaming conservatives' exploitation of race for their recent resurgence. In many examples, he is outright wrong(such as his analysis of the Willie Horton debacle), and in others he dramatically overstates the significance of the particular action. The only credible observation is that of the evolution of a new form of politics, a political system in which ""image is everything"". However, Carter complete ignores liberal manipulation of race in politics, and this book subsequently comes off as being very biased. If you're looking for a good book on race in politics, I suggest reading The End of Racism by Dinesh D'Souza or Hating Whitey by David Horowitz."
4,"Very Good, but not his best","All of Rene Aubry's Cd's are worth owning. Some of his music, such as this one, is from the soundtrack of a French movie. It is a little darker than most of his others, but still very good."
5,16 years of wrestling history in one book.,"This is one of the best reads Ive ever had. This book gives lots of info for each wrestlemania including the set up of the show, before the show, during the show and the end of the show. It will also teach you that it is not that easy to choice a location and celerbraties dont come for free. This book has for clear and awesome picture which have never been shown in any other book. If you have a DVD player your in luck because this at the end of this amazing book it also has an Wrestlemania DVD with matches and celebraties."
1,"Gee, I guess not the WWF is 'real'","Please, a book about the WWF??? Is this supposed to make professional wrestling into a sport instead of a joke? Sorry, but since I don't live in a trailer park, I guess I'll have to pass on this."
3,Good........but not Great,"The book is very good. And for NEW wrestling fans who just started following the business past few years it gives a nice history of WM. But most hardcore die-hard pro wrestling fans have heard most of these stories before or won't be all that intrigued by them. It is a solid book that can be read in a day or two. The DVD is nice. But like I said, if your a die-hard pro wrestling fan don't buy this book expecting to learn anything."
5,one of my faves in the series,"Jimena, who was once the toughest gangster in East L.A. before discovering her true destiny as a Daughter of the Moon, finds out that Veto who was once the love of her life is now alive which is impossible because he was killed in enemy land a year ago which we dont discover the real truth on why he was killed til later on in the book. Jimena becomes suspicious because every time veto shows, a earthhquake or thunder starts forming unexpectantly. Jimena figures that Cassandra, a Follower of the Atrox has a fail safe plan to stop the Daughters of the Moon by stealing their powers. Jimena discovers the horrifying truth about Veto and the thunder quakes thats been happening often. Veto has been animated by the Atrox to trick Jimena into helping him later knowing it was a trap. Veto is now trapped in the land of Tarturus which members of the Inner Circle meet in which Jimena must now find a way to free him before Cassandra uses him again to hurt Jimena"
3,half and half,"i thought the book had a super good story line but what was really annying was jimica always speakin in spanish. its like, what if you dont speak shanish are you just sopossed to not no what shes saying, really jeez. other then that i really liked the story and it is vital to read in the seres."
3,Seems pretty cool,"Okay, I've only seen the first episode from NewType but that alone makes me wanna see the series. It looks amusing between the two main characters, and Soske(I know, sp) being so rigid and linear it'll be a great show, can't wait to get it!"
4,A Fragrance From Angels,"I think that the scent from this cologne is wonderful. I have received nothing but positive compliments, after applying it. Some women have even come within close proximity just to inhale the aroma. I find that the supply is exhausted quickly, therefore, it may not be the most cost effective product. It does, however, get the job done because it has gravitational pull to most people who catches a contact!"
2,Smells like baby oil,It would be cheaper to buy baby oil and put that on your skin for about the same smell that this cologne gives.
2,poor tailoring,"Cheap looking, with poor tailoring.I was really stunned cos it looked nothing near what it didon-line."
1,Pipe Dream from the Left,"(""Piaget made the remarkable discovery that, contrary to received scientific wisdom, intelligence and creativity are not fixed at birth. ...he found that the young mind has an unlimited capacity for growth and adaptation."") While the book has some good ideas on how to optimize the abilities that your genes give you, the notion that anyone can exceed those genetic limits is Used Car advertising at its best. Read de Bono and Lucas for an honest approach."
2,Poorly written,"Although this book probably contains enough information to pass the exam, I found it to be a poor read. The authors introduce acronyms that have not been defined and make gross assumptions about the readers background in higher mathematics and cryptography. It was one of those books where you find yourself reading the same paragraph multiple times only to that the topic is just not well explained."
4,Lots of Jerry Slap Stick Lewis,This is Jery Lewis's last movie. Lewis puts on a great show for all. After his job as a circus clown is gone Bo Cooper (Lewis) goes from job to job searching for his calling in mid-life. After many jobs and many halarious encounters he finally realizes what he has to do. Just be himself.
1,Makes Springtime for Hitler look like Citizen Kane.,"Everything about this movie was so much worse than just horrible that I couldn't turn away. From the cheesily generic 70's TV music and titles to the blatantly stupid and unfunny ""gags"" to Jerry's immovable pinky ring, this could have only been made on a bet to see if the laziest, sloppiest, most amateurish and plain unfunniest movie in history could be made, released and even find some small audience of admirers. Scientology has nothing on this. And Lewis thinking that simply knocking things over and making goofy faces convinces me he was never really funny at all, but just came up in a time when people were starved for anything. Milton Berle had similar luck. I guess people could only watch quality stuff like the Marx Brothers and Preston Sturges so many times before any crap seemed like a needed break. Holy dung!"
5,One of Jerry's best movies in his later years!,I admired Jerry's movies from the Paramount years from 1957 to 1965 and this movie from 1980 (not produced by Paramount) shows Jerry in his outrageous best! The misadventures of an unemployed clown seeking work from gas station attendant to the post office is FUNNY! Give it a look for yourself!!
4,Decent Quality,"Decent quality, no problems with the items. Not very good at holding the smaller wrenches I have, but fantastic at holding my largest. I have two of these, one for American (up to 1 1/16) and one for metric (up to 22mm). I've mounted them on the wall. The only issue is the mounting spots on the product are 5"" apart, so if you're looking to mount on a wall and trying to hit studs, you'll have to improvise."
5,"A great book, but very sad","I loved this book, but it is very sad when Annies Little brother Ben died...you will cry on and off for at least the next half hour.It is emotional yet funny at parts...I definately recomend it!"
4,Great beginner level book!,"I'm not sure what the other reviewer was looking for, but for a beginner-level book (which is the purpose of 21-day books), I thought this book was fantastic! I had zero experience using Visual J++ and within a couple of days got up to speed and was writing applets. What more can one ask for? As far as I'm concerned I got exactly what I wanted: a book that got me up and running without a lot of fluff. Now when I'm a little more comfortable with the basics that this book presents, I'll move on to a more advanced book. Like I said. Exactly what I would expect from a 21-day book."
5,Read the book!,"Not to be missed; the truth should be broadcast about Graham's worldly, non-Christian connections and his departure from classic Christianity. Freemasonry and Christianity are not ever compatible."
4,Movies from childhood,"Remembered these movies from long ago!!!! Have never seen them on tv in a long time. Always wanted to see them again, so I ordered them. Glad I did!!!!"
4,Baseball Joyful Escape,"When the rat race of modern life gets to you there is always timeless baseball. Unfortunately the modern world has found a way to corrupt the purity of the game. These two movies harken back to the older "" purer "" days. Yes the movies are dated and abit corny but the values still ring true."
3,poor proofreading,"The story was OK, but the fact that there was absolutely no effort to present a finished product that I would not buy one of her books again. I caught my self re-wording sentences so that they made sense."
1,"Sappy,sappy, sappy","Now I know why this one was $.99. Found the characters weak, the story line implausible. Really, we are to believe he gives up his law career overnight, moves himself and his child into an apartment over a weekend and then has his bar open in 3 weeks, liquor license and all? What age is this child? Acts like a 3 year old destroying everything, but yet can correctly interpret her dad's flirting eyes? Our heroine is weak and apparently at age 35 is entirely under the total control of the matchmaking old ladies in town."
5,An emotional flow awaits you...,"I am listening to this CD as I write. There is a haunting quality that flows throughout the musical score. My favorite songs are the robust (1) Minor Swing and the meloncholy (3) Story of Grandmere. The soundtrack takes a musical journey, and takes you along for the ride.Wonderul! 5 stars."
2,Not as good as I expected,"I bought this CD based on the reviews on amazon.com. This is the first time I come across Rachel Portman's work so I will not critisize her work in general but I found the soundtrack to Chocolat to be boring. The music is very monotonous. I haven't seen the movie, maybe the music works well with it but I would not recommend buying the soundtrack. If you're looking for a lively and exciting soundtrack, this will not be it."
5,Swweeeet!,"I bought this soundtrack, though I haven't seen the movie, and I absolutely love it! I think it's worth buying, especialy for tracks 1/2/4/ and the last one. Whether you are a soundtrack collector or not, you should like it! It is a very Mediterranean score, but that's a good thing for some! Great price for it too!"
5,"A visual, aural, sensual, and almost tactile masterpiece!","This movie is delicious in every way. I have screened it at least 10 times over the years and it never fails to raise my spirits. The soundtrack alone is enough to make the movie a classic, but it is equalled in excellence by the script, setting and sets, actors, and performances!"
4,Interesting but not too exciting,"I first got hooked on to Bernard Cornwell reading his first book in this series, The Last Kingdom. I think it's interesting that Uhtred journeyed all the way to Northrumbia, became a slave, and still went on to kill Ivar Ivarson in an important battle, but frankly, he could have put in more action. I felt the pace of the story was rather slow. It was more illuminating to read the first episode and the fourth one that followed, the Sword Swong. Having said that, this one is much better than the Pale Horseman."
4,Decent book,"This is a pretty good book. It ties to historical events and puts an interesting and personal aspect to them. It makes for an interesting read, worth the price"
1,Liberated!!,"I've read several reviews and see I'm not the only one who felt Uhtred's devotion to back stabbers is not only unrealistic, it's bad writing. As my past review of The Pale Horseman details Cornwell lost me as a fan, and now entirely as a reader, by making his main character so unworthy of respect.I listen to these audio books during my commute. I DON'T want to get aggravated by the masochism of a dunce. Uhtred may not be capable of standing up for himself but maybe he'll swing Serpent Breath against the cobwebs in the library book return box. I'm through with Cornwell."
4,This is a good book for interviews and refreshers,"These questions are the type that Microsoft will ask you in the interview (Interviewed there 5 times). If you can't get these questions right then forget about working for Microsoft. But I noticed that all organizations don't use this technique to determine the qualifications of a potential employee. I moved to washington, dc and companies here are more concerned about a canidates ability to do the job then to solve frivously puzzles."
5,byte and bit your interview,"Having gone through a number of technical interviews, this book definitely hits home. It includes questions I have encountered in interviews and actually came in handy when I interviewed for my current position.That said, the most important thing a candidate needs to have is the ability to actually do the job. While studying this book will give you an edge in an interview, the candidate still has to ensure that he has the skills to get the job done."
3,"Beautiful, but difficult to open","We love the beautiful looks of this teakettle. The ""footprint"" is sized to fit on the small burner, which can be an advantage in using less energy. But the flip pour-top is very difficult to open. It's almost impossible to hold the handle and press the pour-top open with the same hand. The amount of pressure one must exert to flip the top makes it very hard for someone with arthritis, or for anyone to safely open the top without upsetting the kettle or brushing against the side."
5,Tight thriller with great acting.,"I have decided to write reviews for both the original and remake of the fabulous film back to back.Gregory Peck play's Sam Bowden an lawyer with a nice family and a good structure around his life. He is unprepared however when Max Cady,Played with fantastic menace by Robert Mitchum, is released from prison and shows up in Bowdens life. Cady is angry with Bowden becouse he testified agianst him at a assault trial that resulted in Cady's incarceration.Two of the most different actors stay in this fantasticlly paced thriller. Mitchum is scary and itimmidating as Cady while Peck's Bowden is so reserved you wounder just what would happen if they got into a life and death struggle. This movie delivers on all leavels. You care about all the charators and feel a real sense of dread whenever Mitchum comes onto the screen.I also reviwed the other Cape Fear but forget the remake and see this one instead."
4,Cape Fearful,The suspence in Cape fear is thick as the humidity of a Carolina summer. Robert Mitchum wasone of the greatest actors he made it look easy and always gave the effort the role required. Cape fear was great Gregory Peck and the supporting cast do a good job. One of the best psycological thrillers.
4,"I liked the remake better, but I still enjoyed the original","After I saw the remake years ago, I had to check out the original. I preferred the DeNiro/Nolte version, but this version was very good, too. I had to keep remembering that this movie was made in 1962, and back then it was considered kind of daring just to even SPEAK of the crimes that ex-con Max Cady (Robert Mitchum) committed. But for its time, it was risque. I thought Gregory Peck seemed a little wooden in his role as Sam Bodden, but Robert Mitchum was excellent playing a real sleazeball (I mean that in a complimentary way, if there is such a thing). He made this movie worth looking at. Also great was the musical score...so very chilling, that they used it again in the 1991 version. Worth checking out."
3,Mitchum was powerful in Thompson's thriller...,"Mitchum was, if anything, even more powerful in ""Cape Fear,"" possibly because his antagonist this time was the perfectly contrasting Gregory Peck...Mitchum played a sex criminal, freed after eight years in prison, who returned to a sleepy little town to terrorize the witness (Gregory Peck) whom he blamed for his conviction...The ex-con uttered no threats, used no violence, broke no laws - and the police were therefore helpless... But his very presence, the tone of his voice, the look in his eyes as he turned them lazily on Peck's attractive wife and adolescent daughter showed with unmistakable and cumulative menace that he would surely take his revenge...Peck planted his wife and daughter on a safely moored houseboat to tempt Mitchum into a trap..."
3,Eh...,"Of BitH's albums, this is the one I play the least, as none of the tracks really appeal to me. ""Helen"" is the standout, although the sweet ""Ask"" and the sexy ""Get it On"" are also noteworthy. I don't like the faster version of ""Crawlin';"" why the group felt they needed to re-record this song is beyond me, as the first take was pretty darn perfect. ""Gravity Buster"" is just silly, as is the hidden track at the end of the CD (which, I understand, was intended for the ""Muppets in Space"" movie)."
5,"Very upbeat, a pleasure to listen to, especially Salzburg Symphonies 1,2,3","It is easy to understand why Mozart's music has stood the test of time. This music is very upbeat while being intricate and melodious. It is a sheer pleasure to listen to, especially the Salzburg Symphonies 1, 2 and 3. This also proves that there are true treasures that can be found in the bargain stores, which is where i got this one."
4,Gruesome,"Being a horror junkie and having seen many many horror movies, I thought this movie was a very good dipiction of the life of one of the most insane serila killers of our time. The movie has some slow parts, but the acting is very good, and it leaves you with an uncomfortable feeling while watching it.Like the other reviewer said only two known murders, but in the film you are led to believe that he murdered many more than 2.This is a must see for the horror junkie and worth a spot in any horror collection."
1,Injustice To The Original Madness,"Fans of Ed Gein's sad and bizarre life will be very disappointed by this sloppy, inaccurate attempt to capture the essence of one of the weirdest, outlandish human beings who ever lived. Some things -- the changing of the victim's names for the sake of their families -- can be overlooked and forgiven, but as for giving Ed an explosive personality and casting the rail-thin Carrie Snodgress as the obese-in-real-life Augusta Gein...these things are just unacceptable. The acting is only fair and the movie tends to focus more on Ed's interaction with Plainfield's citizens than it does on the childhood that eventually caused Eddie's dementia. Throw in some cheap-looking body parts and obviously fake blood, and you've got yourselves a messy, boring, falsified mockery of a movie."
3,A REVIEW OF THE TRUE STORY OF ED GEIN,OK HERE IT IS SOME FACTS IN ED GEIN MOVIE ARE A LITTLE OF FOR ONE 1 VICTEMS NAME WAS CHANGED HER REAL NAME WAS B WORDEN OF WORDENS HARDWARE AND EDS BED ROOM WAS RIGHT NEXT TO HIS KITCHEN NOT UPSTAIRS LIKE IN THE MOVIE AND IN REAL LIFE HIS HOUSE WAS A LOT MORE FILTHY THEN IT WAS IN THE MOVIE A FEW OTHER PEOPLE WHERE MADE UP FOR THE FICTION PART OF HIS STORY BUT OTHER THEN THAT IT WAS PRETTY ACURATE STEVE RAILSBACK COULD OF BEEN A LITTLE BETTER HE WAS MANSON IN HELLTER SKELTER OVER ALL I WOULD GIVE THE ED GEIN MOVIE 3 STARS OUT OF 5 I AM A RELETIVE OF ED I HAVE ALL WAYS FELT SO SORRY FOR HIM AND HIS VICTEMS & FAMILY.
2,wasted portrayal,"I was staying up late one night and happend to catch this movie late on the T.V.It starded off great, and looked like it was going to be really good. Then about 15 minutes(or somewere around that) the movie took a downward spiral toward being a cheap, and not as ambitious as it looked like it was going to be.First of all the acting was bad, and a movie like this one proves how important good acting is to a very much talked about subject matter like this one.2nd of all the movie is not that realistic. I realize the things that Ed Gein really did were far out, but this film just lacks an imortant realisitic aspect to it. For example. In one sceen Ed Gein shoots a female baretender, then while she is still alive, Ed drags her accross the floor and puts her into his truck, and takes her home. She kinda acts angery at Ed rather than fighting for her life.Bottom Line: If your want to no more about the subject, look elase where. If you must see it. Rent it. Don't spend to much on it."
2,Ed Gein,"The movie was slow, It had some good elements to it and followed the gein story in some ways, But it lacked the violence that ed had done.If you are gonna make a film about gein then do it right there is alot of things that should have been in this film that were not. Mother should have been seen in her shrine, You never see ed trying to fix her up with other peoples skins or even going into her room. This should have been a major role in the film. Why feel sorry for ed that seems like what the director was aiming for, Dont get me wrong ed dancing in the moon light was classic, For die hard gein fans i still think the classic DERANGED delivers the goods."
5,Witchblade Anime,"Super sexy anime based on the graphic novel line that Top Cow has been faithfully producing for many years, now. Linked closely to the Darkness in the books, and thus Magdalena, there is no tie-in to the traditional myhtos here: slightly disappointing, but still a ton of hot action. Definitely not suitable for young viewers, gratuitous violence, sexual content and adult situations. Superb anime."
3,good info,So far this book has been a great source of quality information on culture and history. I don't usually use these books for the places to stay because my arrangements are made privately. I do feel this book is a great resource and is a good deal for the money. I will have to see how it measures up when I am in country.
5,Great game!!!,"Increadible game. there is so many good things I about this game. Here are the ratings.graphics 9/10weapons 10/10 tons of weapons with realistic sound affectsStoryline 10/10overall 9/10I got these ratings comparing this game to other shooters such as Medal of honor Frontline including rising sun, Hitman 2 and etc. If you enjoy shooting with a little blood and gore get this game heck this game is worth $50 to me."
4,Saga of Vietnam War and its Aftermath,This book is for anyone interested in the Vietnam War and particularly the US Army Rangers. The story concerns two New Englanders who wind up in the same company but become involved in their own private feud while battling the NVA enemy. The battle scenes are realistic and very graphic and it gives the reader an insight into how this brutal war was fought from the perspective of the average infantryman. The second part of the book is about what happened to the two main characters as they live and relive these experiences many years later. I recommend this book for anyone who seeks to find out the motivation of our soldiers when in battle and how they are able to cope with all of it in later life. This book was certainly an eye-opener for me and I'm sure for others who have read it.
2,she isn't different from the other singers of today!,"After listening to to all of those 30-second song samples, I can't decide whether to listen to all those songs again in 30-second form or to never listen to the songs again... although I have come to a conclusion about the album itself- the songs have the same beat and sound the same from the second song to the last song. ""Bounce"" is maybe the only song that doesn't sound like all the others. ""Bounce"" and ""Zero To Hero"" are the only songs she's put out right now that I actually do like. If I want to buy an album that doesn't sound the same from 1st to last track- I'll buy a Sandra Cretu or Peter Schilling album!Sarah might have a 5-octave singing voice, but she still doesn't have any difference with her singing or sound..."
1,hmmmmmm,i heard bounce the other day and theres nothing good about it .its juat a ripoff from mary j blige's family affair.
4,"I tell you boys and girls, She's Unbelievable","I agree with other reviews that something is really missing, but what i heard is that this US release was just part of the contract that Sarah have with Sony. They don't really care if she has or not success in America, wich is very difficult at this time. People in the US are no more fooled with this kind of pop artists, i'm not saying that Sarah is bad, I'm a fan of her, but in The US people is not interested on this no more, but i still hope that i'm wrong on this and she can at least demonstrate that i was wrong"
3,Sarah Connor in the US,"I was rather surprised to hear Sarah Connor's song Bounce on the radio the other day, especially since her 3rd CD was recently released in Germany and Bounce is from her 2nd CD.I'm reluctant to give this CD a lower rating, since Sarah's songs are all spectacular, but I'm rather shocked at how paltry the selection on this CD is. It seems to be an amalgam of her three albums that are available in Europe, but at only eleven tracks, it's rather disappointing. Her three CDs in their original form all have many more tracks on them.For a fuller picture of her work, check out the imports Green Eyed Soul, Unbelievable, and Key To My Soul. Key To My Soul is much more soulful than her first two and shows her taking on a more mature sound."
4,Wonderfully intriguing reading,"I have to disagree with Ms. Snyder and say that this book was one of the most subtly witty and genuinely intelligent lesbian novels I've read in ages. (I also have to say that amazon.com's comparison of this book to, say, Karen X. Tulchinsky's ""Love Ruins Everything"" is totally off-base; the only similarity is the fact that both books have lesbian characters!) The fast-moving plot's twists as it wove around two fascinating protagonists kept me turning the pages almost too quickly--I didn't want the book to end. All in all, the novel was quirky, imaginative, and full of the kind of dark humor that appeals directly to readers like me. I look forward to Robson's future works, which I'm betting will be more masterpieces of literary fiction."
4,oh jeez...same dif,"POSITIVE...you could get this edition before the american versionNEGITIVE...you dont get the SAVED remix, which is awesomeall around good, but you might as well just get the american version so you get more songs"
3,Toilet Fill Valve,"I found that it was hard to install the clip onto the fill valve that is used to adjust the water fill level in the tank. Unless I'm not understanding how it works, I don't believe it's possible to adjust the fill level after you have installed the valve into the tank bowl. Otherwise, I really like the way the Korky Quiet Fill works."
1,Dissatisfied,I had professional installation. Did'nt last 2 months before water is running. It runs interminttenly and makes a stuttering sound. My guess is its made in China.
2,Fail eventually,"I've installed two of these. One ""sings"" and the flap cover doesn't seal properly half the time I flush it. The other one has begin to stop the water flow about a 1/4 of the way to filling the toilette so the toilette can't flush. I'm looking for an alternative, as these are not worth the money."
2,wouldn't refill in locked position,"Not that easy of an install, because it's tricky to adjust the water level. At first the toilet wouldn't refill, so I did a google search to try to trouble search and found someone who said their's (a different brand) wouldn't refill in the locked position. So I unlocked the valve and now it's refilling, thankfully. But all this took a little while to figure out, about 45 min. - 1 hour to replace and get it to work. Hopefully, the 'unlocked' status of the valve doesn't cause any future problems. Oh, and it doesn't seem that quiet either. You get what you pay for, I guess."
5,Great Shampoo,"I bought this shampoo because it was recommended to me by a friend. She told me to look on Amazon to see if they had any good deals, which I found one. This shampoo gives great volume and body... I would recommend this to everyone!"
5,Matrix Amplify Shampoo,I like the products it can like new on time I would rate this with 4 stars I am very happy with this.
4,Recovery and Full Life,The approach in this book to addiction recovery guides the reader through steps to defeat the addiction and begin again a full and satisfying life through a combination of a twelve step program approach with the similar techniques of the Buddhist experience.
4,Buddhism and the Twelve Steps -- Perfect Together!,"Kevin Griffin shares his experience and knowledge in this book, which deepened my understanding of the Steps and the part they can play in our spiritual/psychological development. His non-academic, conversational discussion of each Step gave me fresh, inspiring insights into the practice of my program. Highly recommended!"
4,Excellent book on STL,"I used this book extensively to introduce myself to STL years back. STL and its patterns were completely unfamiliar to me at the time. The book made understanding these patterns and libraries very easy. One thing I remember is the samples in the book were not that great. Fortunately STL is so popular now you can find samples everywhere. Still, very nice reference book for STL."
5,It Just Works,"I've tried a number of different so-called ""automatic"" litter boxes, but none worked very well and all required either lengthy setup or frequent manual intervention (which defeats the purpose of having an ""automatic"" box).Not so here. Took it out of the box, put it together, plugged it in, added my preferred brand of clumping litter, and it just worked. The cats had no qualms at all about climbing in (including right out of the box, while I was trying to assemble the thing).""Dirty"" litter drops down into a separate compartment, so odor problems go away, too. And since -only- the dirty litter's drawn out, less is used compared to manual scooping."
1,Not reliable,"Worked great for 6 months. Then it would periodically just get stuck, mid-cycle, leaving the cats S.O.L. (no pun intended). Unplugging and plugging back in would fix it, but this makes it basically useless - we would have to check it constantly, and couldn't trust it when we went out of town. Plus, doing a thorough cleaning is a pain. Lesson learned: stop looking for magic solutions and just scoop the dam* poop once a day."
2,Great Idea but NOT for my cats,"The Litter Robot is a great idea and perfect for us lazy Americans (yes me too) who want the unconditional love of a pet but are too lazy to clean up after them. My cats were terrified of the Litter Robot. I was surprised how large and scary-looking the device is when I took it out of the package. I followed the instructions to get my cats used to the device and never turned it on to keep them from being more frightened but after one month, they never used it. Perhaps it was entering the globe that frightened them? I have a scoop free automatic litter box which they adjusted to quite well and was looking to add another litter box to our home. When I called the Litter Robot customer service line, they referred me back to Amazon to return it, which surprised me also, since their manual states the device can be returned to them. So I guess if your cats are used to automatic litter boxes and entering dark confined areas to do their business, this product is for you."
2,Reliability Problems,"This product is a great concept and I love it when it works! Unfortunately, I think this product went to the market before it was ready. I've already had the front control panel replaced, followed by the entire base. I recommend this product, but I also recommend waiting until the product is more mature and the reliability is improved."
2,Not too good,"This was fine at first, but now it just gets clogged every time I use it. It's a waste of money in my opinion."
4,Great Litterbox but my cats wouldn't use it.,"This is the best automated litter box on the market. It is very well made and I had no problems during my 90 day evaluation. Having said that, my 3 older and bigger cats that are used to an open litter box wouldn't use it. I guess there is something about going into the hole that they didn't like. Our 2 smaller kittens had no problem jumping in and doing their thing! It all depends on your cat(s). Very disappointed that I had to send this back because it was so easy to deal with. It does save litter and you don't have to empty the thing as often a littermaid. I hope that litter robot comes up with an open model in the future that will work for me."
1,disappointing and...,"I bought this book since it had the Betty Crocker name attached to Indian cooking. However the book is a huge disappointment, to say the least. It is a mish-mash of North and South Indian recipes, some vegetarian, and some meat dishes, with no demarcation between anything. Recipe titles are poorly translated into English, and the Indian names are sometimes in Hindi and sometimes in tamil. While the pictures are tastefully done, seems like Raghavan iyer is otherwise confused. If you are Indian, you definitely can do without this book. And if you are a non-Indian looking to buy a good Indian cookbook, feel free to pass on this one. There are better books out there."
2,Full coverage and shapes... when it works,"Vanity Fair makes some great bras. I wear Vanity Fair bras for 95% of my outfits (except when I need a push-up or strapless). This particular bra is great because it shapes and lifts, and is extremely comfortable.However, the reason why I gave this product a 2-star rating is because the underwire broke. And I've had several bras of this style by Vanity Fair that have all done the same thing. It usually happens at the worst time too, and then you feel out of place all day until you can go home and take it off. Something needs to be done so that the underwire lasts longer, but isn't too stiff."
4,Kwik-Stop styptic gel,"I decided to buy this when I ordered a nail trimmer for my dog - the second time I used the nail trimmer, I took off too much on two of his nails and this gel was easy to apply -- hopefully I won't have to use it again but it's a relief to have this around just in case"
2,Based on Pilates,"I started doing mat pilates at my athletic club in January. It's a new class at my club and only offered once a week. I needed more pilates workouts to supplement the class I'm attending so that I am doing pilates 3x a week. It was important to me to stick to the most ""pure"" pilates, what Joseph Pilates invented all those years ago. I know enough about the basic moves to know that THIS is NOT anything like the classic pilates. There are a couple of recognizable moves, but this is mostly a dance warmup. These moves are what I have seen my daughters doing at the barre before their dance classes. Not totally without value, but not what I was working for. They have a lot of gall to call this ""perfect pilates."" It should be called ""based on pilates"". A disappointment."
1,Horrible,I only got this game becasse it was so cheap. I was munibulated by its cheapness. Don't get this game if you are like me
2,Doesn't make the cut,"I am a huge Manhattan Toy fan, and my babies love several of their toys. The Whoozit spiral, unfortunately, does not make the cut. The product picture of this toy is deceiving. After two months of use, the spiral remains in a tight coil, so as other reviewers have pointed out it is hard to discriminate toys. This would have made an excellent car seat toy, had the manufacturers figured a way to keep the spiral stretched as it is pictured."
5,Wonderful toy!,"I purchased this for my new grandson and according to mom, the baby reached for the toys right away!! Prior to the time he received the toy he was just watching his mobile and lights in awe. With the purchase of the Whoozit toy he began to reach for the objects and mom was very happy!! I would recommend the Whoozit toys for babies beginning to follow objects as soon as they receive a Whoozit Spiral and other Whoozits they may begin to actually play with them!!! The toys can be used strollers and cribs and probably more. Great idea, great toy."
3,Disappointed!,"The rug I received is actually MUCH lighter in color and the stripes run the length of the rug not the width as one would assume by the picture. It also took longer to arrive than most products as it was not shipped directly from Amazon, but a third party. I am going to keep this rug to use in a less conspicuous location than where I planned to put it, but it is definitely not what I was hoping for :("
3,Good but not great,"I must be hearing something completly different then those who say this is ""one of"" or ""the best"" Judas Priest album. From a songwriting point of view, the first 3 albums were stepping stones to bigger and better things. This album is where they found their ""sound"", but their writing skills were still developing. I don't consider this among their best efforts, although any Judas fan would enjoy it."
4,The most essential Priest album ever!,"This album is from the earlier days of Judas Priest. This is the T-shirt and jeans rock that they produced before becoming the more familiar leather and metal most fans are accustomed to seeing. ""Victim of Changes"" is probably Rob Halford's best vocal work to date. Some songs are rough and jagged (The Ripper), while others are more etherial and thought-provoking (the aforementioned Victim of Changes). Throughout the album total unity of the bands' collective talent is prevelant. Any fan of Priest who hasn't had the chance to listen to this album is definitely not getting the whole range of one of Metal's most influential bands. I highly recommend this to any and all fans of not only Judas Priest, but also to fans of Rock itself. BUY THIS CD-- YOU WON'T REGRET IT!"
4,Should have been an eight song album,"I have been a Priest fan for over twenty years and saw them live in `90.I never heard this album until today and for most part it is excellent,except for epitaph.I don`t know what they were thinking when they put on the album,because it would better if had thrown it away instead."
5,Simply Amazing!!,"I have heard this author speak in person and he is just as amazing in print!! Some may agree with the previous reviewer that reading the actual documents themselves or Flannery's version is more helpful, and that's fine. What you simply cannot do without is the first volume of Huebsch's 3 volume set. In it he paints a vivid, enjoyable, informative picture of the situation preceding and surrounding the council. As someone born at the tail-end of the 1970's I knew nothing about the council before reading Huebsch's books. His first book was so interesting and wonderful that it only made me want to learn more! Imagine that! A book making a Catholic want to read more Church documents! Wonderful! Loved them! Go Bill!"
5,THIS BOOK ROCKS!,"In this book, Catty finds a secret scroll that may destroy the Atrox once and for all. She also meets her real mom. Catty's powers are put to the test when she battles one of the most fiercest followers of all. But what she is about to find out is that the follower has been disguised and is among one the daughters."
1,this should be rated 0 stars.,"Once again, another CD with all ""new stereo recordings"" on it. It really is not fair to the customer and very misleading. I think you should note on the screen in bold print if the songs on any CD/Cassette are not the originals. Thank you."
4,The price that you cant beat,For $34.99 you can't beat that I love that show when I was about 6yr old
1,Deffective collection,"Well just want you guys to beware because this collection can have some deffect. In my case like other's the last season that is suppose to have part A and part B discs, it has 2 part B's. Return it? I don't think so, I read bad review's about amazon giving you refunds. So, at least I didn't lose 50dls I bought it when it was on a deal."
2,"Great Show, Rotten laughtrack","I have Volumes 1 & 2 of the DVD set. The episodes are great, better than I remember. However, any enjoyment is ruined with the incessant rotten laughtrack that seems to play after ever sentence uttered.I would love to have the entire collection if I could find one without a laughtrack!"
5,Tell Thing to hold all calls...,"One of the most genuinely crazy-funny TV shows of this Baby Boomer's childhood is The Addams Family. Sadly, it seems to have disappeared from television -- at least, I haven't seen it in ages.What a coup to have this complete set of the entire series. The DVD is perfect in every way, except for one flaw that was part of the original -- a laugh track. I'm happy that this seems to have disappeared from the television shows of today. I think I'm culturally savvy enough to know where to insert my own guffaws and giggles.What a great treasure to own!"
2,Excalibur,"This contains a sample of Richard Wagner's soundtrack to the film Excalibur. It contains the beginning and end themes, but unfortunately left out the battle them which was on Ozzy's Tribute album. The soundtrack to Excalibur is hard to find, with several bogus cash ins appearing on the well into today.But still to even have one or two complete themes was credible nontheless. The other tracks on the CD are forgetable. That's m y favorite movie is Excalibur."
2,not so great,"Sure it works, but it has many flaws. For one thing, the audio sucks. You can't turn up the bass without affecting the overall output significantly. The smart sound and smart picture features are just useless presets. The worst part is it sometimes makes this loud, high-pitched noise, which is much louder than the usual noise that all TVs make. Also, you can't turn it off. You can only put it on ""stand-by"", which wastes power. Shell out the extra 40 or 50 bucks for the toshiba or sony."
2,There are better choices,"IMO, the format of this edition is not suitable for this language. Most people learning PHP don't need instructions how to type characters, they are not retarded.I found the same book format quite suitable for HTML and CSS, for example, or anything that has to do with visual design. But not for a programming language."
2,Hard to follow,"I learned ASP and Mysql with great ease and quick progress with 'the visual blueprint' books, the delivery were clear and concise.But things have changed in this new series. The writing style is difficult to understand: instead of explaining the topic first, the writer jumps right into 'you can do this and that'. I have to read each chapter several times in order to grasp what he means. The screen shots are now arranged on top of one another. Which is by itself ok if the text are not reduced even smaller making it more difficult to read.I am quite disappointed by this 'new' approach. I hope the publisher has not changed the 'your visual blueprint series' intojust a reference book instead of being a teaching book which it was so good at."
4,Clever...too clever!,"SPLENDOR IN THE GLASS is a clever book. In fact, its greatest problem is that it's too clever.Its protagonist is too cutesy, the protagnist's snap responses are too quick and too hokey. This is a shame, because author Tamar Myers obviously is a gifted writer of mysteries.This story is complicated and interesting: Myers' details about Charleston, where the tale is set, and about collectible crystal and antique shops, all seem accurate and these really are quite interesting. Her ear for dialogue, even when that dialogue is strained, is excellent.Thus, the overly cute tone bogs down what actually is a very good mystery, rather than enhancing it, as had to have been Ms. Myers' intent. SPLENDOR IN THE GLASS--even the name is cutesy--is a good book. Yet this novel misses being great, and SPLENDOR did have the potential to be more than it was."
4,Rating BOTH workouts included,"Veena and Neena have done a lot of workout videos and it's always great to see the twins together. At 1st glance, I thought the twins were working together on Bollywood Blast but was surprised that Veena was leading the workout with 2 other dancers. Veena did say that Neena helped to design the moves. That disc lasted for about 26 minutes. Indi-Hop is also included (which I already have) and lasts for about 34 minutes (including instruction time).I prefer Indi-Hop because it includes 3 dance routines with different levels of intensity. Bollywood Blast is great for the obliques with the different twists and leg lifts. I did have to add another workout since this one is so short. Doing the 2 discs together would give you more of a complete workout and plenty of yoga stretches."
3,Great Dance Not Much Bollywood,"Once again another Bollywood workout dvd, yet something is missing. The moves on the dvds are not bad. But there is no Bollywood music!! Please future makers of Bollywood workout dvds, please include Bollywood music to workout to!! Songs like Aaja Nachle, etc.. and moves that go with the songs."
3,Indi-Hop Disc is Great; Bollywood Blast Not So Much,"I love that I got two workouts on two discs with this purchase. But the Bollywood Blast disc was a disappointment. It was not a full workout and was over before I could come close to breaking a sweat.The Indi-Hop disc was a decent workout-about 20 minutes of elevated heart rate plus warm up and cool down.Bollywood Blast and Indi-Hop are more approachable than the twins' older videos where the only instructions are in voice-over. But they've sacrificed content and a better workout in these two.I still prefer their Slim Down and Core Conditioning workouts. Even so, the Bollywood Blast and Indi-Hop workouts are mostly low-impact and fun, and I still use the Indi-Hop disc weekly.Separately, I would rate Indi-Hop with four (4) stars because it could be longer and Bollywood Blast with two (2) stars."
5,Tough Project,"Getting behind Neil Young's personal story would seem a tough project, if not near impossible. To have the amount of access, yet still retain the ability to observe with a genuine critical perspective, makes this book the daily-double of rock reporting. Tremendous research by an obviously obsessed author neither weighed down the assignment with minute detail nor diluted his journalistic integrity. Brilliant works by Young are championed, whereas the music and other stuff that fails is given equal time in the spotlight. The real treasuer is Young's personal thoughts and feelings. As much as I admire Neil Young as an artist, after reading this book I'm not sure I'd wish to drive cross-country with him. The definite source on Neil Young."
2,Yawn,"I can't believe the reviewer who says ""Why can't all biographies be this entertaining?"" I couldn't get through this tome of boredom! I love Neil Young and was looking forward to finding out more about him. But I just could not wade through this. Page after page was boring, not because of Neil's life, but because of the writing style. Blah blah blah. An amazing dude like Neil Young deserves a better biographer. I was sorely disappointed. Every other bio I've ever read was better than this - which I guess makes this the worst one I've ever read!"
3,a must read for Neil Young fanatics,"If you're a Neil Young fanatic this book is a must-read.If you're not, its not.I'm a Neil Young fanatic. I read the whole book and learnedmany things I didn't know before. I agree with other reviewersabout the book being repetitive, overly long, poorly organized,poorly edited, and lacking a discography. Fanatics will beable to overlook the book's problems, casual fans or less mayhave more trouble."
3,Bogged down by minutiae,"Having listened to Neil Young for over a quarter century, and seen him live a half dozen times, I read some great reviews about this book. I also read Neil had sued McDonough over the book. After I began reading it, I could understand why. It's difficult to slog through supposed biographical moments like ""that afternoon, he went to his mom's house and slept on the couch"". If McDonough had been half the friend he held himself out to be, he wouldn't have bogged down the book with so much ... . I guess I learned my lesson: If you're really into a musician or band, let the music speak for itself, and take from it what it gives you. Don't seek out other people's interpretations of the person's life."
1,Don't buy this hairdryer,Bought this hairdryer a month ago and as we speak it is in a landfill somewhere. What a piece of junk. Just stopped working one day. Would'nt turn on at all. To return it would be more of a hassle and expense than its worth and Conair knows this so they continue to produce inferior products knowing they won't get them back. The retractable cord worked when it felt like it. Don't waste your money on this one.
1,It started a fire!,"I've been through 2 of these hair dryers. The first one stopped working after a year. The second one's cord twisted up and could not fully retract. For about a week it keep going on and off. This morning the cord sparked, smoked, and started to flame. I will not purchase this hair dryer again."
1,Piece o' JUNK!,"Since our bathroom cabinet is short on space, I loved the IDEA of this hair dryer! Unfortunately, the idea was more a fantasy than a reality. I only had this hair dryer for about a month before the cord-keeper button fell out (spring and all!) and the retractible cord stopped retracting. Since that was the only reason I bought this one over other models, I was sorely disappointed! Also, this dryer is so L-O-U-D that I had to wear earplugs (no kidding!) while drying my hair so that I wouldn't damage my hearing! Hands down the WORST hair dryer on the market!"
1,"Loud, shrill, unbearable to use...","I got this to replace another Conair dryer that I LOVED. I wish they would stick with their old way of doing things instead of ""improving."" It isn't as kind to my hair while drying and is too painful to my ears. Am returning it."
1,Dont buy this hair dryer,I have bought hair dryers that lasted years and years with daily use. This one I had for 3 months and it just stop working. Don't waste your money on this item.
2,great for a while,Mine worked fine for a while. I've had it about a year but I didn't use it all that much until about a 2 months ago. After about a month the little plastic piece that you push to retract the cord broke so now no retractable cord. I liked that feature for easy storage. So far everything else still works. I'll keep you posted.
5,GREAT VALUE,"My daughter can not live without THIS hairspray. She has lots of options but this works on her long, thick, soft hair without her hair ever feeling sticky or crunchy. You would never notice that she has product in her hair."
4,Let's hope for more,"To echo what others have said, the quality of the transfer isn't that great, but from reading more about the series it seems that it was shot on film and then transferred to tape for editing. So, there is a limit to how much they can do. Since the entire series only consisted of 43 episodes, I was hoping that we'd see more than the 7 episode first season in the initial release--but one can hope that more will be in store. The late Mary Wickes is a true delight to watch."
3,Morse set 10 - Father Dowling mysteris.,"I have not yet seen the other movies, thats why I cannot rate them.I love the English detectives like morse and lewis.As soo as I see them I will be happy to rate them.The Father Dowling mysteries are all right for younger people. The Sister is just too much. looses credibility."
1,Product of Second Vatican Council,"The Second Vatican Council literally and completely revamped the Catholic Church.One result of these reforms, some Priests and Nuns have become militant and startto put their noses on non-religious issues.Father Dowling Mysteries is all about a Priest and a ""Secular"" Nun who investigateMysteries. Most of the plots are lame and uninteresting. Although, Tom Bosley dida good role."
4,"Thank you, Mr. Alexander.","Sadly, Bruce Alexander passed on before the final edit of this book, but his wife aided in its completion. Alexander's writing had an intellect and elegance I have so enjoyed. This is not fast paced suspense and I knew who was behind the death, but that did not diminish my enjoyment. It is a clever puzzle I enjoyed watching unfold, the sense of time and place is exceptional, and I appreciated that there was a resolution of the main characters. I very much enjoyed this book and series, and shall miss Mr. Alexander's lovely writing."
2,Disappointing,"What a sad way to end a superb series. If I read ""Said I"" one more time I seriously thought about throwing the book across the room. If you haven't read this one and really enjoyed Alexander's other books, save your money, it's just not worth it!"
5,Used Paperback Book,The paperback book was in excellent condition and was delivery at their estimated time. I would used this company again to order used books.
5,superlative performances.,"You will not find any superstar pianists on this CD but in my view the pieces in this collection have rarely been better performed. The Chopin and Liszt pieces, in particular, are priceless."
2,"Great story, poor story telling","This was a BIG missed opportunity to tell a great story. Instead, the author felt the need to inject his own anti-nuclear, anti-boy scout views into what should have been a non-political story. It's still a decent read, but I give it 2 stars for the missed opportunity."
3,The Author,"The book itself is good, the story is fine, but the way is written is terriable and they author uses the word ""hence"" almost every 2 pages."
5,Great for children,"My 2 1/2 year old twins LOVE this book. The illustrations have prompted conversations and learning that they never would have had otherwise. I actually especially like the human anatomy pages. The non-sexual nature of the pictures makes it easy to talk to your children about the human body in a matter-of-fact way. They both know the difference between a boy and a girl, know that their baby brother was in my stomach, and understand the basics of the digestive and circulatory systems!Also, the other illustration-packed pages have taught them SO much. They know the names of instruments, animals, tools, and vehicles. The cool thing is that it lets you explain whatever catches their fancy. Anyway, I love this book. It's one of the best impulse purchases I've ever made."
3,5 minutes,"Whatever the movie was about? something about a coming of age drama, I definitely remember the 5 minutes of increasingly rare nude sex scenes in movies these days. Kelly Preston, YUM!"
3,Heart and Soul...,"Heart and Soul... that was supposed to be the name of this movie.. it was filmed in my hometown. Some of my workmates were extras in it. The movie tells the story about adolesence in full blown glory... and it is timeless regardless of the time period,... although here it is 1955. The old town square looked pretty good here. For those of you who are 40-60 and up, this will bring back lots of memories no doubt."
3,"Gorgeous mirror, came damaged","This is an absolutely beautiful mirror. I bought mine from another vendor, however. The mirror unfortunately came damaged. Two inch crack in the mirror along the bezel, probably from screws that were too loose and mirror clips that were too small, which I found after close inspection. Dealing with my vendor was a NIGHTMARE. Minka doesn't package this item in a way that makes it easy to get it out of the box, and you basically have to destroy everything. Had a huge argument with my vendor over not having the box for the return. Don't know what's going to happen to it, but I'm getting my money back and ordering a different mirror from a different vendor. Makes me sad because I really like this mirror. :(I would give this mirror five stars for beauty, but only one star for construction due to the small mirror clips and poor assembly."
5,"So far, so good...",I ordered this replacement battery pack for my cordless phone which is a little over 1 yr old and not holding a charge. I received item quickly. Charged up the battery pack completely and drained it completely as I've learned to do with these types of batteries. Two weeks later is doing fantastic...about 1 week stand by time.
5,AMAZING!!!,"Very simply...this is an amazing book. Both informative and compelling, Arenas draws you in like few can and doesn't let you go until long after you've devoured the last page. I couldn't put it down!!!"
3,Interesting but I'm a little suspect,"Great story, for the most part but the writing is choppy and there are leaps of faith the reader has to take in order to make sense of the story and Arenas' choices. Gay or not, he is a sexual pig and it really starts to get boring. And I found my self questioning the validity of some of the stories."
2,Duke's Review,"When I first saw this ring on the back of a wrestling box, I thought I had to have it. When I got it for my birthday I was so happy. But when I got it built it wasn't as good as I thought it was. I didn't like it because the metal posts kept coming out of the plastic post supports. I think for a collector this would be perfect as long as it was never played with. If you want to play with it, it is not very strong. I think that the support clips need to be taller. I was very disappointed with this toy."
3,Useful,This book is useful for quick references but I wouldn't depend on it to pass a Fluid Mechanics course.
1,waste of time and money,"This movie is so awful it's laughable. Ever go to the movies and feel you were ripped off. I got this movie for rewards points and still feel ripped off. Yes, it's that bad. Kate Jackson never could act, she had one voice she repeatedly used, it's a cross between southern and whinney and by no means pleasing to hear. David Carradine is a better actor (only by a little bit) but the writing is so bad, he can't begin to save this miserable attempt at movie making either. I gave it one star, because there was no provision for minus 5 stars. It's an hour and a half you'll never get back. It's too late for me, but save yourself and don't buy this movie."
5,CD REVIEW,THIS WAS AN EXCELLENT SPEEDY TRANSACTION. ALTHOUGH THEY SAID USED...THIS IS LIKE BRAND NEW CD. THANK YOU
5,Sit Back And Enjoy The Ride!,"A classic 1977 moonshine film (others include Moonshine County Express, a must for future DVD release with John Saxon, William Conrad, Albert Salmi Susan Howard, Claudia Jennings and Maureen McCormick).The DVD includes both full screen and wide screen presentation and the print is amazing quality. Everyone does an excellent job and it is one of those films where you like the 'bad guys' as much as the 'good guys'. David Carradine and Kate Jackson make a likeable duo and Roger C Carmel has fun with his role as does George Murdock and Charles Napier. Also look for Sterling Holloway as one of old time moonshiners. In all a fun filled romp for all."
3,"Smokey and the Bandit came out right after this and is a little better, but attractive pairing of young Carradine- 'Angel' Kate","Jackson. Hawai'i Five-0 vet Roger C.Carmel is outstanding in here as Jackson'sdad. Longtime Carradine movie partner, C.Napier is good in here as well as otherHawai'i Five-0 vet, Ron Feinberg. Direc-tion is only average and too much profa-nity may turn some off. TV prints aleivatethat, but still this movie is underratedand hard to find! I first saw it on videorental in Roanoke, VA back in early '90's.Like many I missed it in Theatre back in'77 because of Smokey and the (overrated)Bandit I. But this film is better than S.A.t.B. II or III!"
5,Just what I wanted!,"This ring is just what I was hoping for. Beautiful, plain, white-gold band. It is ""half round"", which means that it is not as thick standing up off of your finger. It still has the rounded look, but is not so bulky...That is perfect for my smaller hands.Overall, it is a beautiful ring of quality."
5,You gotta her this women voice !,"This CD is one that you will make your heart sing! Janie's voice and words are powerful. The songs are stories that everyone can relate to.You can feel the heart and soul, that has been put into this beautiful collection of songs. Joe Reggiatore is an excellant guitar player, in ""Carried Away"" listen to him play ! ""Strenght is my religion "" is a song that will move you, for everyone that has taken the next step even when they thought they could not. ""Save yourself"" listen to the words, feel the music. Words to live by. This CD is one that will soon be your all time favorite !This CD will make you look at life with new eyes .Treat youself to this CD, Janie Cribbs is a woman to listen to now ! If you enjoy Bonnie Raitt, Robbie Robertson, Sting, Shawn Colvin,Sarah McLachlan... you will definitively love this CD."
3,does a good job for fine hair...don't like the smell,"B&B; Alojoba conditioner is a light conditioner that would probably work well for fine hair. Unfortunately, I have thick hair...and would need a lot more of this product to make my hair feel nice and silky--even more unfortunate, I don't have the kind of money to buy that much of this product. Perhaps I thought I would get more bang for the buck since B&B; is well-known and generally makes a good product. It also has a smell that I can only describe as ""earthy."" Some may like it and think it is ""fresh"", but I didn't particularly enjoy it.I rate this product 3 stars because while it may be good for fine hair, it did not sufficiently condition my thick hair. In addition, I did not like the smell."
2,Storytelling,"This may be an entertaining book if you want to read stories of foreign cultures and habits, but I don't think it meets the scientific standards of anthropology. The subtitle of the book is ""an analysis of the concepts of pollution and taboo"", but this is an overstatement. You will not find any true analysis in it. Every time the author approaches an analytic question or theory, she soon lets go of her thread and diverges into another irrelevant story. While reading this book, I asked myself several times ""wait a second, what does this have to do with pollution or taboo?"", ""what was the subject matter of this chapter again?"" and ""what conclusions can be drawn from all these examples?"". My questions were left unanswered, so this book was a very frustrating read. It deals with an interesting topic but the author just doesn't manage to gain any interesting insights. A few disconnected thoughts scattered among colourful stories is all you get in terms of analysis. Very disappointing."
4,vale la pena,"a la verdad que este cd me sorprendio porque yo no soy un fanatico de los discos anteriores como(mundo frio)despues que los escuche en (no fear 4 ,la conspiracion la secuela y the company)me comenzaron a gustar sus canciones. este cd es una mezcla de reggaeton con rap mis canciones favoritas son(tu me guayaste,andamos prestao, gata traicionera, te quiero ver bailar y ella vive sola que la cantan junto a gustavo del grupo la secta)"
5,Good stuff for my Service Dog,This powdered product goes nicely into the chow for my Service Dog. With it she appears to have no joint pain. It is good stuff.
3,"Not a 1 1/4"" knob","I was trying to match existing knobs which are 1-1/4"" in diameter. According to the Amazon information available, item Laurey # 54437 is a 1-1/4"" knob; it is not. It is a nice knob but it is 1-1/8"" diameter. A brass knob that is 1-1/4"" knob is Laurey item #52637. The #52637 has a slightly different neck configuration from #54437. Both are well priced, substantial brass knobs."
1,Don't waste your money.,"This well made and nice looking trick falls far short of spectacular. It's barely puzzling. The problem is this: you mentally divine which of two boxes the spectator has hidden an object in. There are only two. Anyone could guess this correctly 50% of the time, and the trick CANNOT be repeated without the secret quickly revealing itself. So, you can get it right once, and that's it. No one will be amazed. Or even marginally impressed."
4,Very good product,"very versatile product, good quality and very useful. The only bad thing is that no code has to make of TV Daewoo"
5,Can't express how beautiful this night light really is!,"These Penguin night lights put a very special touch to my rooms, my daughter and I are Penguin lovers and these night lights are just beautiful. The detail takes my breath away!"
3,Diana,"Received sooner than expected, quality good for the price however made for a 5'4"" ind. I am 5'8"" and the dress was way too short but had to wear it anyway. (Did not have a hem that could be let out.) Being small does not mean short as well.Thanks,Diana"
4,Garage Door Bottom Seal,This is a very good seal and installed without much of a hassle once I rounded up two people to help me thread the seal into the holder of an 18 foot garage door. I used spray silicone to make the job easier. The way that the seal is packaged creates kinks in the seal edges and makes installation much more of a challenge than is otherwise necessary. The company did a great job shipping and was very fast in getting it to me.
3,likeable but for all the wrong reasons,"This movie is a highly enjoyable tale of an imposer pretending to be Stanley Kubrick, taking everyone for a ride, and getting away with it easily. John Malkovich is delicious as gay Alan Conway posing as Stanley Kubrick. Stanley Kubrick is said to have been intrigued by Conway and the movie reflects this silliness and mischievousness. The movie is also a tale of debauchery that goes unpunished and thus serves no moral value. Then again, who needs moral fiber in a movie this entertaining?"
1,"Great for watching some windsufers, not an Encyclopedia","The footage of people Windsurfing is great, as for production quality and actual content this is a pretty bad DVD.For example. There's a section where they have some footage with a number of angles. Rather than actually use the angles feature of the DVD so that you can change the angle during the clip, you have to go back to the menu and select it.I certainly wouldn't pay $30 for this, I'm very glad I rented it."
1,Infrastructure Specialist,"Anyone rating this book above a one is either a friend of the author or has shares in the publisher. The books consists of random chapters with no common thread or purpose.From a basic introduction to multi-tier applications we jump into advanced COM techniques (where were the basic ones?) with no details of their use or benefit.The book requires a good deal of COM/DCOM knowledge to make sense of it and offers little insight or explanation. For example, the different threading types are coded with little description in the text and there is no discussion as to their use or application.I picked the book up for $7 dollars and I feel its barely worth that, never mind $31."
5,WHAT CAN I REALLY SAY????,"They dont make music like this anymore. And it's unfortunate. Teddy Pendergrass MEANT IT when sang a song. You can feel it. You can taste it. Soul R&B from this era is totally different from what it is today. These guys actually cared about their music FIRST. The almighty dollar was nice, dont get me wrong, but for artists like Teddy Pendergras, Al Green, Marvin Gaye, Freddie Jackson, Jeffrey Osbourne, etc. their music, and the quality of their music, came first. Todays artists will put out any old piece of crap just for the money. Their music has no soul. This is a beautiful album. I love to put this album on and just let it run. Teddy has such a beautiful voice and his lyrics come right from his heart and soul. When Mr. Pendergrass is hurting in a song, the listeneer is also hurting. This music is timeless. I wish todays artists would wake up."
5,get you in the mood,"this cd will get you and your love one in the mood , its one of the best of all times love making and happy feelings cd with hit after hit thanks BiggBadd Danny Quinn."
2,I had high hopes,"I read some of the previous reviews and had great expectations for this product.Firstly, the two graphics for the twin or single cup option is confusing - after we got over that...When we only make one cup - the other side leaks !!, all over the counter if there isn't a cup in the way to catch it.Starting with cold water, as you should - the water doesn't get hot enough to stay hot through the time it takes to consume the cup, even with the included mug(s).I was interested in this as we were trying to use less coffee - that is: make only what we'd drink - and have a fresh cup every time without the k-cup trash. I guess I was asking too much."
4,good product,"It works well and makes good coffee, either one cup or two at a time. If making two cups, it can be two strengths of coffee, or one could be another type of hot beverage. This is what I was looking for and found. The coffee is hot, although not super hot. It is necessary to warm the cups and the liquid creamer prior to making the coffee. It has an on/off switch, which I have to remember to turn off when the brewing is done. The coffee maker I had before turned off automatically after brewing, so this is a slight nuisance. However, the brand I had before costs over twice as much. I consider this a good buy for the money."
5,best ever,I wanted something affordable and I didn't want to have to buy those coffee things made for a keirrg. I love this so much I got one for my sister for Xmas!
4,First coffee machine ever....quite good,"This is my first coffee machine, and I am originally not from a coffee drinking nation. The traditional coffee machines I have seen people use look quite bothersome to me, especially with the large pots, and the filters. This machine is quite good for the fact that it's simple to use, brews enough coffee for one and has just two knobs :).Only issue I've had is that the opening device for the lid of one of the cups broke, I'm going to have to glue that or something, I don't know yet. Still I give this device 4 lovely stars for being simple and perfect for my use over the past two months.Cheers"
4,Morning options - Coffe and Tea,"I bought this unit becasue my one cup at a time Keurig unit gave up the ghost. I have tried two other single cup at a time coffee/tea makers but thought the idea of having coffe and tea (I drink tea in the morning and my SO drinks coffee) out of one unit was awesome.I tried it out for the first time this morning and it worked as expected. Coffee on one side and tea on the other.Pros:1. You can brew two of the same or different morning beverages.2. Comes with its own travel mugs, although I still used my own.3. Both beverages came out tasting as expected, just like the Keurig unit used to make, but at a much lower cost.4. Cost - very cheap to purcahse unit and per cup cost is low (compared to Keurig).Cons:1. No timer, so you need to push the button when you want it to brew. So, I dinged it for half a star.2. Slow to brew. Not sure how you may feel about that, but I like my tea brewed faster. So, I dinged it for half a star."
3,WELL MADE THRILLER SHOWS THE HORRORS OF EARLY MEDICINE,"If you like gothic horror and tales of body snatching, you'll probably enjoy this chiller. Pretty great cast, Timothy Dalton, Twiggy, Julian Sands, Jonathan Pryce and Steven Rea all lift this film to a classy level with the guidance of director Freddie Francis who worked on some of the classic Hammer films. Both widescreen and full screen versions are on the disc and both audio and picture are of good transfer. There are however no extra features."
3,Ole Hanson's suggestion,"Ole says ""1.e4 c5 2.d4 cxd4 3.c3 g6 4.cxd4 d5 5.exd5 Nf6 6.Bb5+ Nbd7 7.Nc3 Bg7 8.d6 0-0 9.dxe7 Qxe7+ Black's castles cleanly. White has the isolated d pawn, which may become weak in the endgame. I believe nearly everyone would agree that black's position is objectively better. "" ... but please note that Black is a pawn down. DrDave, Exeter"
1,Seek elsewhere!!,(The writer of this review is rated around 2200 and owns above 100 chess books)Too many mistakesToo many bad suggestionsDubious plansUnsound variationsAside from having yet another book on my shelf it is a complete waste of time!Do yourself a favor and look elsewhere!
5,Awesome!,Watching the guys in this video restore this old 1923 T-Bucket Hot Rod was AWESOME! They give step - by - step instuctions on how to make replacement parts for your own automoblies!
1,Another company forcing consumers to buy BluRay,"I love the fact that The Nest is finally being re-released remastered widescreen. Unfortunately, as a collector only interested in buying the DVD I am now forced to spend additional money to get this since it is only available as a combo package. I don't understand the logic behind this combo package as the DVD will be useless to BluRay collectors and vise versa. Please SHOUT! do us a favor and release the DVD edition on its own."
5,NIce manual to own,This is a very good repair manual for a Ford Explorer owner. I assume it works on several years and models but I use it for our 2003 Exploder. Well worth the money. It does require a basic knowledge of tools and mechanics but it does contain much good information.
3,Dated,"A Rochester classic . . . . albeit 50+ years ago. The author names names, but the narrative is so dated now that only the most knowledgable Rochester historian would recognize even a fraction of them. Well written, biting commentary on bygone Rochester institutions like Kodak, defunct newspapers, and the (then) big banks.Best part of the book? The author displays clairvoyance in describing Haloid which . . . ""makes photographic papers and are obsessed with an idea called ""xerography"" which if you can believe what you hear, is a coming thing."""
1,The Best From Broadway Musicals,Very disappointing. I expected all Original cast recordings not just a couple. The rest is all instrumental. Don't waste your time...the price should have been a clue!
4,Avid hiker from Chico,This is my second pair of these boots. For me they fit so well and are so comfortable there is literally no break-in period required. They hold up fairly well for lightweight boots but I usually go through a pair of boots in a year anyway.
1,What?!?!?!?!,"After reading The Alienist, I thought ""Why not see what else this guy's written?"" Should've known better. All I can say is thank God he waited 14 years to write another book!!! (Must've been taking classes....) Couldn't really make it past the first chapter. The charcters were, well, thinly veiled real people. He should have just called the ""hero"" Caleb... Sorry, Caleb, loved everything else, even the history books, but this is simply unforgivable!"
1,Have fun!,"Getting past setting the examples up. Whole directories are mentioned out of the blue where they didn't exist before. Unzip to <this> directory. Now open up <that> directory...(Of course <that> directory isn't even previously mentioned)And now let's work with *another* file/directory...that doesn't exist....Sheesh...if you can't trust 'em to get *this* right, how can you trust 'em in the rest of the book?"
1,Worst layout of a book EVER!!,"I've had this book for 5 days going back and forth over Chapter 1, Chapter 2 and Appendix B...they just don't connect like the book expects them to.You won't be able to get past chapter 1 without pulling your hair out!It talks about download files to C:\website\WrokUnitedbut then talks about access files from C:\website\WrokUnitedCSand also throws in another unknown directory named C:\BEGASPNET2.There has only been 1 directory that we have been told to create, and was C:\website\WrokUnited and it was from Appendix B!!I guess these are the problem you have when more than 1 author writes the book...no one knows what the other is doing!"
1,This book is garbage,"So I read the first 2 chapters and already 2 examples did not work at all. On the first example, the book asked me to create 2 files with the same name. Of course, when I did it the 2nd time it asked if I want to overwrites the file. Fine so I did that to move on.On the 2nd example, the book asked me to create 2 DIVs with the same ID. Of course, Visual Studio will complain about that.I kept reading over and over again in hope of an error coming from me but no, it's the book.I just ordered the book and now I'm waiting to receive it so that I can resell it back immediately. What a waste of my time."
1,Hockeypuck,"Seller I bought from was GREAT. But this tape is an absolute complete was of money. Horrible, Horrible, horrible. DO NOT WASTE a CENT on this!!!! It is a few minutes of poor quality, minor league fights, in fact the same fights are shown, over and over again. Music is bad...IT IS RUBBISH!!!"
1,great....,great... another whining punk band that sounds like everyone else who complain about everything in the world and how their life was miserable when they were actually raised in a quite affluent suburb (if you can even call it that) of chicago.quit whining and get a real jobthese bands are a dime a dozen.dont waste your money
2,OVERPRICED,"I bought one of these units several years ago and sent it back. It sounded pretty good but my $120 boombox ( I think it was a Magnavox ) sounded just about as good as this. I was really disappointed after all the hype in the Bose AD. I had a couple of friends listen to it before I sent it back just to make sure I was giving it a fair chance. Like me they thought it sounded slightly better than my old boom box but not worth the $1,064 I paid at that time. That was several years ago so maybe they have improved ( but so have the $120 systems ) I would say go listen to one of these in person before you spend this kind of money. I think the Wave radio sounds good as well but it should be about $100 to $150 not $500!"
2,"Not too bad, not very good, either.","Roger Corman-produced post-apocalyptic horror flick involves a beast running loose inside a shelter. Yes, it's Alien underground! Begins well and suspenseful, but loses all momentum by killing off the film's most likeable character (played by Starr Andreef, who's rather hot), and some poorly choreographed attack scenes don't help. Features mostly shoddy monster effects."
3,Shallow Treatment,"I was disappointed in this film, though it was entertaining. There was no character development among the children, or in fact very much development of anybody. I had hoped to learn something of Gullah culture from this film, and was left wanting. There is no discussion of who these folks are, of their history, why they live in isolation on an island.This film could have been so much better. As it was, it could have been another Robin Williams film with the misunderstood, altruistic clown with a heart of gold battling the bad old establishment. I'm sure the book is much better. This is superficial, lighthearted entertainment at best."
4,"Reads very well, keeps your attention.","This book is geared toward the both the user and the Tier I & II helpdesk support person who needs immediate familiarity with Windows 2000. It's not for Server Administrators or Developers, nor is it the ultimate reference for troubleshooting. This is a great book to read cover to cover to learn where Microsoft has relocated all of the NT4 functions & services and get the low down on the new bells & whistles they've added to 2000. Most readers could get through 4 or 5 chapters a night because how well it is written and the helpful screen shots Mr. Desmond has included, instead of wading through techno-lingo in a Microsoft manual. The CD is a nice bonus of shareware / freeware."
3,007,"agree with others the packaging is terrible, and the movies are not in order. We resorted them. Some of the extras on the second disc are boring. some are okay. Also at the beginning of every movie you have to go through the same advertising... just get on and let us watch the movie!"
3,Great Package only disorderly,"Waited to get all the Bonds as a package for a good number of years. This set is complete 95%. Visually very nice in digital restoration, great DTS 5.1 sound as well. Do not understand the order in which the actual movies are cased and presented, story lines carry over in Bond films, original order of release is significant for watching the collection, but that order must be organized by end user, it is NOT in this package when opened. Also, each DVD repeats ""lead-in"" tracks, as though each DVD is seperate from all others. Such repetition seems totally unnecessary as this product is sold as a SET, I do not need to view ""ad's"" for the set I have already just purchased! Only had to buy one other Bond film, Connery's last Bond ""Never Say Never"" to fill collection."
5,Awesome,"This set will be out of date soon, or maybe it already it, but man oh man is it a fantastic collection. It compiled for the first time, the entire run of James Bond. Need I say more? It's awesome!"
3,"FUNNY FUNNY FUNNY, CLOSE TO BEING AS GOOD AS THE ORIGINAL","So we're put back in the pit of teenage disregard, and Pee Wee is just as funny as he ever was, and we find that the boys get thier real revenge on the man that started it all.Its funny and fun. Its good ol' sit back and enjoy it while you can fun."
1,disappointed,"first of all, i am german, so please excuse my bad english.at the beginning, i liked the game, even though it did'nt reach the first part. in some levels, it's not realy easy to play and i got frustrated sometimes. but mostly the ""big monkeys"" appearing every now and then are making me sick, specially spector. me and my whole family tried to beat him for a very long time, and this is just disappointing!stay away from this game, it's not worth the money, you spend for it!!!"
4,"Not so good, but...","Ape Escape 2 is not so good but it works. Really. The graphics are good, the music is good, the voices are terrible and the gameplay sucks. The tank vehicle is so boring it has gotta be illegal. But this game isn't so bad. That's it."
4,It's all good..,"I like this album, it's different from the mainstream of today's hip-hop. It may be underground rap, but the music is good. Reminds me of the old school sounds of Egyptian Lover's music with a resemblance of The West Coast Crew's song ""Jailbait"" & not to mention just a small taste of Lighter Shade of Brown. It's different.. it's all good.."
5,Ok-1 is Ok with me,I worked in supermarket backroom and stocking the store. I would use my left hand to tear the boxes open most of the time. This glove did a good job protecting my hand and lasted the longest out of the other gloves that I have had. Good glove.
1,"dont buy this, get Barron's","what a waste of paper, those poor dead trees that suffered to produce this steaming pile of B.S. This is not CLEP preparation material, not all of this guy's prep books are this bad, this may be the worst.Buy Barron's book (no I don't work for Barrons)"
3,Incredibly depressing yet somehow inspiring,Made the mistake of watching this Christmas Eve. It's such a heartbreaking story based on reality ... perhaps watching it some other time I might have reviewed it more favorably. Good performances all around tho
3,This Movie was not what I expected it to be.,"For what it was, this movie was not bad at all, it was just not the Romantic movie I thought I was renting for a night in with my Girlfriend."
4,Well moving and beautifully shot,"Great story line, plot develops well and then carries you right to the end in suspense. Watching this movie you begin to appreciate why the Chinese are bitter towards the Japanese to this day."
4,Excellent story,"The story was very good. However, I found it to be too graphic with the sexual things that took place."
5,Beautiful story of humanity found in a dark hole.,"I won't ruin the plot. There are some moving moments here; some redeeming qualities. There are also the horrors that none of us like to think about, yet occur during every war, for as long as we can remember.Whether or not China spent considerable amounts on this movie to soften their dominant image, or if its simply a memoir of unlikely heroes & heroines, this story will remain with me beyond tonight."
4,sad true and moving,parallelled Christ's substituionary position ini giving of his life for mankind but not a religious movie can use it for a model though although has some very bad violence of women in it
3,Very violent,"Unsatisfying ending. Acting was good, but needed more depth to the characters. Relationships were initiated, but not as fully realized as I would have liked."
2,Disappointed,I was disappointed in this movie. I thought from the trailer it would be better. The acting was over the top-bad in a word.
3,Slow but touching,"This plot focuses on a church in Nanking at the time of the Japanese invasion of China in 1937. This event became known as the Rape of Nanking as people were massacred, pillaged, and raped. The church houses little orphan girls and soon an American mortician and a group of prostitutes. Everybody comes into conflict with each other which causes them to come into conflict with themselves. For the rest of the refugees to survive, some of them have to make sacrifices."
5,I was brutally crying while watching,"I could not stop crying from the beginning. If you have humanity, you would cry. You would feel as what this film presents. There are many other reviews admiring this film so I would just make perfection still more perfect."
4,A great compilation!,"David Lanz is one of the greatest New Age pianists of all time. He is able to weave beautiful melodies that take advantage of the entire keyboard, rather than just the upper octaves. Lanz got his start playing in a piano bar, but his music is far better than typical lounge fare. He avoids getting in a stylistic rut, while maintaining a consistent sound. If you liked ""Piano 2"" (various artists), you would probably like this one. Like any good Best of, the pieces are arranged so the whole album flows very nicely. Great for relaxation or romance!"
1,Simplistic moronic trash,"So we all know the world is moving very quickly; where's the insight in that? ACtually, if you think about it, there were more profound changes on the daily lives of people earlier in the century, when the automobile, electricity and other conveniences first came into prominence. THis book offers no new insights, no entertainment value( surprising from a radio host) and nothing of any significant value to a serious reader of history or culture. While I can appreciate the need to dumb down history for some, this book makes it an exercise for morons. Even the author's political agenda is ludicrous by any liberal or conservative standards I am aware of. What a collossal waste of time. I'm glad I read it so quickly. Curses on the idiot who gave it to me and forced me to waste my time. I only read it because it was a gift!"
2,Quickening? Let me put it this way:,"""From the moment I picked your book up until I put it down I was convulsed with laughter. Some day I intend reading it.--Groucho MarxThe scaremongering tactics of this book are so patently absurd that I give it the Ed Wood Book Award."
1,Yawn.,"Boring.Poorest excuse for a ""quest"" book I have ever seen.Don't waste your money.Only one interesting insight. And it wasn't much."
1,When You Want To Sale Manure Advertise It like this book.,"This book is nothing but a composite of Art Bell's wild outlandish guest meant for entertainment only not science as he trys to convey. The Quickening only applies to how much money can be taken from your pocket by Art Bell by having you fall for his lack of facts and intelligent conclusions. This book is a failure of nerve by even having it written and printed for public consumption. Everything he suspects is happening cannot be identified, yet he thinks it is significant! Well, he has made himself insignificant by putting his name on such a title of such a book not worthy of keeping or reading."
3,Fast approaching changes coming to the times we live in,"I found most of the book to be a very accurate evaluation of things that are happening around our world today, in what I believe to be the possible time before Christ return.Much to my surprise, much of it was pro Judeo/Christian, coming from a basically agnostic person (Art Bell) that surprised me.However, the book was a little slow and dull at times as well, and I got a little board with some of his fictional stories he used to potray upcoming events, that is why I only gave it 3 stars."
4,The 'Mysterious Ice' Guy Comments,"As an avid listener of C2C AM when Art Bell ruled the nighttime airwaves and what we see happening again in society today, brought me to comment on this work. The first time I read this book, times were indeed chilling socially, economically, and politically during those years in the mid to late 1990s this book rang true asking why? Now, since the beginning of last year, I see this same overall chilling effect in the world as I did then.If you are a long time fan of the show, you may recall my Mysterious Ice photos Art Bell posted on his website a couple times and also included in the Show's Archive DVDs. Those were some great times!"
3,"It's ok, but...","Unless you are a die hard fan or haven't read this this wonderfully crafted stand alone piece, I recommend skipping this. I own the original and expected more content to justify purchasing it again. Needless to say I felt let down. This is great for folks who are new to the Twin Peaks Universe. Its a pre requisite to read (assuming you watched the series first), but there's really nothing new to be found here folks. The introduction by Frost/Lynch is extremely brief and will not provide insight you haven't acquired elsewhere if you have been following the series."
2,Doesnt fit,"I have a boda dome with steps and the things dont fit AT ALL! There are better fit products out there, take the time to find them."
4,"Not the best, not the worst.","I definately thought this book was better than it's precedent, Glorious Angel. Though I always hate it somewhat when the hero falls in love with the heroine so quickly. Desire is plausible, but full-blown love...meh. You didn't see Hank's point of view as much as you did Samantha's and there were some parts dealing with Samantha, like when she came home to Daddy, that I thought dragged on too much. I skipped a few pages here and there. I wish now though that JL had done another novel for Sheldon."
4,Best of Series,"""Merlin"" is certainly the highlight of Lawheads series. I've never read such an intriging account of Merlins life. This book attempts to find an historic basis for the Arthurian myth and does quite well. Lawhead links the rise of King Arhtur to real events and people. It is the most engaging of the books, and avoids the turgid abstration and religious eenlightenment that burdened his later books."
1,misrepresenting,"Seat looks good on paper, but it impossible to install in any car, Mine is a Honda and I could not figure how to install it and had to make-shift by trying to use it doubled over. That didn't work either. It kept slipping off the seat. I wouldm't recommend it to anyone that I liked. I feel like it was money wasted. If I had returned it, it would have cost close to the price I paid for it for shipping."
3,Unsentimental Marital Comedy Misses the Mark,"Despite an excellent cast and a good production, this film fails to strike home. A bored New York thirty something couple's life takes a critical turn when they hire a lovely nurse to care for her after she suffers an automobile accident. Its a 1940's comedy placed in the 1980's but done at the cost of losing the sparkling banter of that earlier age. You'll have to add your own interpretation to bring this into the gay and lesbian category."
3,baby sign language basics,This DVD does not play in my PC..I don't really have time to watch it on my T.V.However it has been very helpful with teaching my grandson to sign.
1,Teaches Mom,This dvd is great to teach parents sign language but I thought it would help teach baby sing language. It does have a ton of words you can learn but the video doesn't help your baby learn just by watching.
4,Beautiful and Relaxing,"Irish and celtic songstress delivers her 3rd album here. Backed by critical acclaim and the voice of an angel, this is an album that showcases her at her very best. Hers is the type of voice that you just melt into and creates a relaxing atmosphere. All the songs are strong and compliment each other with my favourites 'Garden Valley' and 'Walls' sitting out front for me. If you like Irish / Scottish airs, you will love this."
2,Oops,"After Cara's first two excellent albums that retained a real traditional feel within a modern setting, this came as a huge disappointment. The voice is just as lovely, but the music has veered right away from the traditional and into bland commercial-style music. Right in the footsteps of Mary Black. A pity."
5,Education is freedom!,"I think that this movie 187 ought to be drilled into the heads of all miscreants who have purposely faltered in their educational endeavors. Instead of having to look up to a thug or drug dealer as a personal liberator, I feel that a teacher could give a person the ax to free his or herself from the ball and chain of ignorance. That's exactly what Jackson tried to give Gonzalez in this film. This movie also showed that no matter how many times a good teacher may get blown off by young deviants, he will always never give up on them. Remember this-education can open up a lot of doors!"
3,Orange tinged vision of LA Hell,"It grabs you by the throat--you don't want to see it but you cannot stop.Bogs down a bit with some uncharacteristic behavior and laughable impossibilities, but the movie remains true to it's vision of hell. A 24 hour Hell in the mind of Mister G, who is misunderstood and never given a chance, and the very real hell that the principal characters inhabit along with him.He is tasked with making a living and makes the fatal mistake of trying to actually earn his paycheck---sometimes you have to let it ride!!Do not miss it! Despite it's flaws, it is a movie I would easily add to my collection."
3,"A Rock 'n' Roll ""Must Have!""","If you dig 50's rock you'll love this movie. Jayne Mansfield's figure is too weird to belive but she's a dish. PLUS, in one movie, you get Gene Vincent & the Blue Caps, Eddie Cochran, Little Richard, and more. Bop cats, bop!"
2,Where's my favorites?,"These so-called greatest hits often leave out their best known songs from their TV program. For instance, where's ""24 Hours a Day"" (their best song) and ""Story Book Love."" These are the songs I remember. A travesty."
1,You can't be serious,"The Partridge Family was nothing more than a pseudo band contrived to cash in on David Cassidy who himself was merely the flavor of the month back in the early 70's. Just another in a long line of pretty boy teen idols who had their 15 minutes and then were discarded by an industry who moved on to the next big thing. I've no doubt that there are many who have fond memories of these songs from their childhood, but to award this stuff five stars here in the year 2000 is just plain silly."
1,Best left in the 70's,"Insipid songs, lame production, cheesy arrangements, laughable singing. It all adds up to excruciatingly bad music from one of popular music's silliest eras. It is quite telling that David Cassidy HATED singing this stuff, and it is amazing that anyone who has managed to successfully complete childhood would have any interest in hearing this sap again."
5,Bible is mistaken,"This is a very good book. In a mere 131 pages the author introduces us not only to the evolutionary history of mankind, but also to the methods of how and why we know, in short to the science of paleo-anthropology. Focus is on the fossils, and how we date their ages. The author also introduces the use of DNA to explore human pre-history. Most of all, he never minimizes the problems, the doubts, and the uncertainties of the science. This little book clearly shows that the first dozen pages of the Bible can not be literally true. Any creationist who has not read this or a similar book (e.g. Smithsonian Intimate Guide to Human Origins, 2005) can not know what he is talking about."
2,Extreme disappointment,"I eagerly looked forward to reading this book, and gaining further insight into questions of morality in the moral crucble of concentration camps. But Todorov's thinking is fuzzy in the extreme, moving from cliche to nonsense. There are many extremely good books that cover the same material. The Nazi Doctors, by Robert Jay Lifton is infinitely better, as are The Anatomy of Human Destructiveness by Erich Fromm, Treblinka by Jean-Francois Steiner, and Modernity and the Holocaust by Zygmunt Bauman. The only reason I give this two stars instead of one is that the original quotes by concentration camp survivors that he sprinkles liberally throughout the text are extremely interesting. The quotes themselves give insight. Too bad the analysis doesn't match the subject."
2,Misguiding Title,"Not one of these reviews mentions the fact that the actual 'Night and Fog' operation by the Nazis was a completely seperate atrocity from the murder of the Jews; 'Nacht und Nebel' was an action implemented upon the Gentile populations of Europe for the sake of sheer terror; Thousands of civilians were kidnapped from their homes, murdered, and disposed of without a trace and without any publicity or notification just to keep the occupied populations in fear of the Germans."
2,Item was not as described- Got 5' cable instead of 6',Item was not as described- Got 5' cable instead of 6'. It did not work either.
4,Belkin USB Hub,"Ordered this HUB to allow a parallel printer adapter to connect to a usb port.Hub installed easy enough and after several tries to connect my old HP printer to my new HP computer with Windows 7, the printer started working fine."
4,Interesting read,"This 'book' is more like a journal of Tiger's shooting education. It has misspellings, and is not edited very well but that is not the value of this book.It's about knowledge, presented in a way that makes it stick. Tiger has a way of getting my attention and holding it."
1,We are on our 2nd faucet and are having the same problems,"When we bought our house it came with this faucet unfortunatly it broke(about 1 year later, 4 years old) was running water very badly, had to turn off the water and we went shopping. We bought another thinking the one we had was just a lemon. Not even 6 mos later this one started dripping we went to the hardware store we had to buy a washer set.(NOTE the store had a bunch of sets of 2 this made us question if this was a problem we asked and was told yes) To date it leaks every once in while and we have to keep replacing the washers!"
5,Jeter's best horror novel...,"I'm writing this review simply because I think the previous rating is too low although I have no issue with the review itself.Land of the Dead (1989) is probably Jeter's best horror novel although it's certainly not a conventional horror novel. It's best described as a boy-meets-girl love story except that the girl (Fay) can control the dead. The ""boy"" (Cooper) doesn't believe in her until it's too late. Of course, with a premise like that, you just know it's going to have a tragic ending...That said, the book is beautifully written, and it ends on a sad, wistful note. As the previous review states, it very effectively evokes the 1930s depression. The villain of the book, a powerful orange grower, conducts himself like a feudal lord and has near absolute power over Cooper and Fay... the main point of the book I guess is that life isn't fair."
4,Beautiful Baby Book,I love the Thank Heaven For Little Girls Memory Book - there is a page for everything and it's fun to start filling out while your still pregnant. It covers just about everything!
5,My one year old loves this,I love that I can let my one year old love on this and not worry about the chemicals that my be in it. Sturdy construction has survived new teeth and lots of fun play.
2,Sooo disappointed!,"I really wanted to love this! It looked soo cute on the site, and I love that its organic cotton..however, my baby doesn't care for it. I gave it to him and he just ignored it...disappointing!"
4,Journalism or propaganda ?,"A hard assessment of a less than lovable couple - Harry and Clare.Well written, researched in detail, the author portrays Harry Luce's business accumen as well as his drive for power, desire for association with royalty, aristocracy and tycoons of all colors - often lacking in good judgment as to heroes or villains. What started as a business enterprise developed into a propaganda tool for the Editor'sopinions and beliefs - with hundreds of possibly otherwise talented writers and reporters toeing the line of the boss.The resulting influence on public opinion and the government proved disastrous in relations with China, prevented recognition of the dangers of the Nazi regime and fascism in Italy."
4,Geneva 9 by 11 - Inch Octagonal Wall Clock,"For our purposes this clock is fine. We needed a Kitchen clock for over our sink/window and this one fits our space perfectly. It does have a louder tick/tick than our previous clock, but if it's not the dead of night you don't really notice it (the previous clock didn't tick).The gold band is missing between the glass and wooden piece, but a previous reviewer had mentioned this, so it was not a surprise. The box claims this is a wood clock, but judging by the weight and feel, I doubt it is a solid wooden clock; probably veneered finish. If you are expecting a really well made piece of furniture, take your clue from the price. But it keeps great time and hung 3"" from the ceiling none of the other features matter much to us."
1,Wow After 30 Days....,"This clock is the worst thing a person could buy. I bought it because I thought it would match the decour in my dining room and it was small. The second hand on the clock got stuck around 50 days after purchase and the only way to fix this problem is to buy a new movement. This clock is going in the trash and is getting replaced by something else. A new movement is more than the cost of the clock. I can't return it, it does not come with a warrenty, and to repair it costs more than the clock. It is a big waste of money. Do not buy, I repeat, DO NOT BUY."
2,geneva clock,Clock hangs crooked. Bad workmanship!The wood oak rim was mounted to the clock slightly skewed causing it to be balanced more to one side causing the clock to hang crooked.I plan on re mounting the thing but haven't had the time.To costly to return to vendor.Randallhttp://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000117C8Q/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title
1,Pure garbage,"I purchased this 45 rpm single believing that I was getting the original 1982 recording by Toni Basil. And why should I think differently? Nowhere in this listing is it disclosed that this is in fact a poorly conceived and awfully executed 1999 ""Radio Remix"" by Jason Nevine for Nevco Productions, Inc., which, by the way, STINKS! This remix has absolutely nothing meritorious to offer the professional DJ, the music lover, the dance club groupie, or even the idle curiosity seeker. The original was so superior in every way, shape and form that the only conceivable justification for releasing this knock-off is pure profit-motive on the part of the Nevco Productions, who reaps the profits, no doubt, from every sale. Buyer beware! This is neither litenable, danceable, or enjoyable. It is only irritating and disappointing."
3,Useful information poor format,"The guys in the video mention that they have limited video editing skills at least, but let's face it, adding chapters to a DVD isn't that difficult. Aside from the poor craftsmanship, I found the video informative. The price is a bit high, but there weren't any other videos out there that sounded better and I really wanted to be able to see the process instead of just reading about it."
1,101 Rip offs,"This CD of XP Games can omly be described as a major rip off. After loading, it asked which language I preferred. Clicking on English resulted in the game purchase ads written in German and the trial game began in German. Please don't waste your money! You still have to buy the game at various prices after a trial use of 30 days, along with a gift for languages or a good English/German dictionary."
5,The Best Pimpernel Book,"I've read the first four SP books, and this is my favorite. It doesn't have as confusing a plot as some of the others do (Namely Eldorado...) Plus I think that Percy and Chauvelin are perfectly matched up enimies, and they show it off better than anywhere else in Bouloge. This is the most swashbuckling version of the one's I've read, where Chauvelin tries to win by brains and Percy beats him out with brawn. Beautiful!"
4,Fun read,"Another fun adventure novel, and the sequel to The Scarlet Pimpernel. It continues telling the story of the League of the Scarlet Pimpernel as they attemp to save more aristocrats from the Reign of Terror. It's not terribly interested in historical accuracy, but that's probably what makes it fun. The main characters are endearing, but you find yourself saying, 'Don't do it. It's just what they want you to do!' quite often. Sometimes the female characters are annoying because they are too much the stereotypical Victorian female, but you are still drawn into their lives and hope for their success. I recommend this book if you've read The Scarlet Pimpernel and you really liked it."
3,The Holy Land,"In my opinion I think Jerusalem should have been divded up evenly between the followers of Islam, Christianity, and Judaism."
4,Did a good job except.....,"put together very well, reenactments were good, packed with lots and lots of info. focuses mostly on the crusaders but still good info from the other side of the story. however, didn't really like the way they protrayed Saladin"
2,Fell short of my epectations....,"This film seems like more of a home video rather than a comprehensive documentary on the day of the dead. I purchased this hoping I would be able to use it in my classroom to give my students a sense of Mexico's day of the dead traditions and I was quite disappointed. I never used it in my classroom. It does not talk at all about the indigenous roots of the tradition and was more of a series of very informal interviews. Save your money and get something else, anything else would be better than this...."
1,Hard to understand; not many enough practice exercises,This book is written at a very high level. It does not have enough practice exercises to reinforce (or check for) understanding.
3,Arrived damaged,"I thought it was strange when I opened up the package only to find that this product was chipped and damaged upon arriving to me. I have no idea what kind of paint is coating this contraption, or what the inside is comprised of, but the paint has chipped off quite a bit and I haven't even used it yet! I'm sure it's functional, but still... it's always disappointing getting something new that appears to have ware and tear already."
1,"Poor quality pot metal, broke after 10 days.","It did work just fine, but it didn't ""get every drop"" and will, if you are not careful, pinch skin. When I did try to give it an extra squeeze, one handle snapped right off.It's in the trash now."
4,An Excellent Starter for Small Business...,"We always look forward to Maria Langer's books. ""Putting Your Small Business on the Web"" is a delightful departure from many of Maria's other more technical books, giving the busy business person a quick, clear and inspiring starter kit for launching a business web site. Maria handholds even the 'old timers' with her easy to digest introduction to what the web can and cannot do for small business. You'll get a primer on web serving options, designing web site and then managing the site keeping it up to date. The sections on ""Working with a Web Site Designer"" and FTP are well worth the cover price alone. __ This is not a thousand page tome that will bog you down with too much techno-mumbo-jumbo like many of the other eBiz books out there. If you're thinking about getting your small business on the web, get this book FIRST. I think you'll be happy you did."
5,It's about time!,"Enabling is the best word I can find to describe this book. It enables the ""newbie"" small business owner to understand e-commerce. There are so many books out there about e-commerce. This is the first one that I have found that speaks directly to the small business owner. Ms. Langer only includes pertinent vocabulary and doesn't overwhelm the reader with acronyms. She speaks to real people. I recomend this book for those who have gotten lost in the hype of e-commerce. This book will lift you out of the acronym soup and paint a clear picture of what the web can and can't do for you."
4,The underappreciated original sound of Spoon,"Spoon's unique sound can be found all over this album. The opening on ""Anything you Want"" is as innovative as some of Yo La Tengo's work. Sharp guitars and emotional strokes on the keyboard really make their music addicting. There is no doubt that Spoon will break out much like Wilco and Modest Mouse did later in their careers. Spoon has too many great hooks and catchy melodies to last much longer as an unknown in the business."
3,great sound,"I was just recently introduced to Spoon through a short animated film called 'Everything Hits at Once' by Divya Srinivasan named after the Spoon song. It's got an amazing visual sense in the vein of 'Waking Life'. The song and film went perfectly together,with its story of isolation and post-breakup blues (at least, that's what i think it's about!) and I was sufficiently intrigued to check out the whole album.I have to agree with the reviewer who said there's an Elvis Costello influence. I can hear it on 'Take the Fifth'. EHAO is a lot more dreamy. I really like what I hear so far and have had this disc on heavy rotation in my car."
3,"Good, but not that good...","The problem with this album is that some of the songs on it are acutely annoying and Elvis Costello take offs. I almost pulled my hair out with 1020am, with its annoying harpsichordish background and annoying chorus...That aside, and Fitted Shirt, and the blatantly Costello Take the Fifth. The rest of the album is quite worth it. It certainly is minimalist rock but they manipulate space and sound well to give it a nice stripped down sound. It is at times choppy and bold which is a lot of fun and catchy...Worth the purchase."
5,Great Album for the ears,"Love this album, plays well with vocals and instrumental sounds. These guys are very talented musicians. Not your everyday indie band. Spoon brings a added element to their music. Sounds better with each listening, which is the basic of being a keeper in your playlist."
4,More steps in a good direction,"I have only had the album for a handful of listens, and this is certainly a 4 star album and maybe a 5 star album with time. Be sure to pickup the ""Loveways EP"" if you enjoy this album. Spoon is becoming a very mature band, and this album is testament to that. 2001 is looking to be a good year for music if you know where to look. And Spoon is leading the pack so far. New albums from David Garza, Wilco, and perhaps the Old 97s are poised to join ""Girls Can Tell"" as the year's best rock albums."
3,Tasty teaspoon,"3 1/2The first side clearly has better tracks in what could have been some of the indie pop rocker's best work from an admirable onset, unfortunately culminating with the infectiously and intelligently catchy Fitted Shirt and rarely recovering memorable momentum."
4,Superior Spaghetti Western,"I recently received this video and was gratified to find it was widescreen. Unfortunately it was recorded in the ep mode from a well-used master which had an occasional line running though it. Surprisingly this didn't detract; many times when viewing the originals at drive-ins in the 60s and 70s, the copies of the movies were well worn, so this was like a time machine. The movie itself is a good example of the genre; Santi was Leone's assistant on GBU and OUATIW, and the influence is obvious. Highly recommended, if your vcr can handle ep mode."
1,THIS is the #1 worse musical I have ever seen in my LIFE!,"...and THAT rating is not just from me but also my friend who I saw it with...it was so painful to sit through that the both of us looked at each other and we laughed the entire second act...and then it wins the Tony Award for Best Musical.....WOW...something's wrong with the universeI just want to say that I've been going to musical theater since the 60s, so I know what I like and what works"
4,A Required Taste,"A very moving and emotional show with amazing acting and beautiful music. Like a lot of Sondheim's work you have to require a taste for it. It is not an entertaining show with large sets and it certainly is not the Beauty and the Beast type of musical. Donna Murphy's acting is superb as she stays on the verge of tears the entire show, and her voice is great also. Like the musical ASSASSINS a true appreciation for Stephen Sondheim must be had in order to enjoy this production."
4,Really good teaching video,"A really good teaching video. My son and I enjoyed it, and we both learned much from it. Pete covers some really important areas, it just needed to be just a litte more clear in a couple areas to rate a ""5"". A baseball teaching/coaching library would not be complete without it."
1,Unscientific,The author is a known charlatan advancing psychogenic theories of etiology re ME/CFIDS that have been proven false to a scientific certainty.
3,"Good, but not Great!","Some of the photography of the horses is breath taking. And you can see the ""Spirit"" of the horses the photographer is trying to capture. But I was very frustrated with most of the photos being blurred which didn't appear like an expression of beautiful photography. And the use of adobe photoshop to change the pictures into a sepia tone in the background does nothing to enhance the work. Although he has shown talent in this photography and in previous photography books, I would not recommend this book to buy."
2,Spirit Horses 2009 calendar,"I order Tony Stromberg's calendar every year, and this year I was very disappointed. The photos are of strikingly poor quality, compared to the usual(some are blurred/discolored), and most of them were displayed before in past calendars. I probably will not order this item from Amazon again, unless I can get a preview of the photos beforehand."
5,A book for all that appreciate horses as beautiful creatures...,"It's wonderful that Tony has published a book of his equine photography. His photographic style is ethereal, artistic and full of expression. The photography is stunning, the production quality superb and the layout is lovely. Definitely two thumbs up."
5,Vitamin Shoppe is great,"Vitamin Shoppe had L-Glutamine powder in exactly the size container and potency I wanted and had been having trouble finding at other vitamin websites. It was priced low, delivered fast and I am a very happy new customer!"
1,UNFORTUNATE ATTEMPT AT POSTHUMOUS PROFIT,"Sadly the legacy of the great Louis L'Amour is being tarnished by members of his family who have dug up stories that, in some cases, were never published, and released them under the title May There Be A Road. It becomes rapidly apparent as to why they were never published. My hope as I waded through this dreary offering was ""may there be an ending!"" May There Be A Road is an unfortunate effort to posthumously profit from the L'Amour name while offering nothing to the reader. L'Amour's masterpieces are readily available in paperback and continue to offer the best in western story telling. Don't waste time on May There Be A Road when you can enjoy The Shadow Riders, Crossfire Trail, The Last of the Breed or Haunted Mesa."
2,What has become of my beloved Tortoise?,"I've been a big Tortoise fan since their first lp, which I still think is their best. But what are they up to with this poor album? There are a couple of good songs, but you're better off listening to Miles Davis' ""In A Silent Way"" than this. If you haven't heard this band before, listen to ""Tortoise"" or ""Millions Now Living..."" This album is a shame."
3,Solid music,"Okay, so it really isn't jazz or fusion but so what! It sounds good and thats all that matters. There is a bit of everything mixed in here. Like on song 2 when that ""foghorn"" kicks in with a funky beat (bass and drums) layered behind it - fantastic.This is my first Tortoise album and definitely not the last."
2,Ahhhh! we got a new studio!,"Upset and confused thoughts of sledge hammers thundering down from the sky like a hail of vengence, then cooed with the hum of a soft wind as the storm moves on. I just can't except the fact that this wonderfully experimental band keeps moving forward. Tortoise never reached perfection: they began with it. Their self-titled record was Tortoise at their blissful peak as a band, then Millions... came along, still amazingly beautiful, yet leaning in a slightly new direction. After that...? This is a warning to those fans of the earlier Tortoise sound: you won't find any duel bass groves or McIntire's sweet drumming style here... just a bunch of electronicaly ""enhanced"" songs."
4,"So it's not ""Millions..."", it's still great","I don't understand all the reviewers that seem to be under the impression that since this isn't ""Millions Now Living..."" it can't possibly be good. You (presumably) already own that album, if you want to hear something like MNLWND, go listen to MNLWND. If you want to hear Tortois' new spin on things, pick up Standards; it's well worth your money. It's an incredibly cohesive album that's downright enchanting at times. Tortoise still manages to pound out unforgettable, gear grinding, mind blowing, rhythms. Minus one star just because it doesn't feal as vibrant and alive as T.N.T. (but that's just my opinion; your mileage may vary; what are you doing sitting around reading other people's critiques anyway, go buy this album if you like Tortoise and make up your own mind.)"
5,Awesome Original Music,"This is the best thing I've heard since Radiohead's Kid A and Amnesiac. Drums 'n bass, funk, jazz feel to it. Everything sounds awesome on this record. Get it."
3,Not for Everyone,"I am not a fan of this kind of cartoon.My review is only my opinion.The first element I found irritating was the near constant screaming of Watanuki.The other main character is Yuko who has a snide voice and speaks in a drone.The images and animation to me, are somewhat poor.The theme about sorcery is weak. I found it difficult to focus on plot,theme,etc, which is probably because it's not for me personally."
2,Glub glub...I'm drowning in cliches,"I'm a little bit surprised to see these high scores, though I'll chalk it up to show's pedigree; this is more work from the sometimes brilliant Clamp. On a visual front, the style is likeable. Characters have height to width proportions a la Jack Skellington, which makes for some interesting movement.The story, however, you've seen a million times in better anime. Spirit world...check. Clueless boy...check. Worldly girl...check. Annoying sidekick characters (and I mean REALLY annoying)...check. I'm willing to tolerate all of the above, however, if a show demonstrates the capability to pull together a nice central arc complete with effective cliffhangers and pacing. I didn't get the impression that that was happening. Perhaps it's too early to judge the show...I just know that I'm too bored now to care whether it does pick up. Next..."
2,Too Loonng..,"Length is not a function of depth. In this book DeLillo adds a few hundred pages to the somewhat interesting postmodernist take on reality he presented in his more imaginative novel, White Noise. Indeed, since the plots of these novels are similar, there is no excuse for reading Underworld. This does not, however, imply that there is an excuse for reading the other novel. But, if you're looking for something new to read, you could do worse than a 2-star novelist like DeLillo, who is at least trying to be meaningfully relevant."
2,Not so great,"I've had this book for over two months now and I'm still in page 300. And I read quite a lot and quite fast. Yes, this book is beautifully written, some could say it is an 800 page long poem. But there's little story, a fractured narrative and unintresting characters. This is a prime example of literary masturbation. All style and no substance."
3,A Hmmm Dinger!,"De Lillo lays open the causuistry of fact and hyperbole that is the late twentieth century. A discourse between competing parts of the mind for the finest interpretation of history, with a Le Jazz Hot sensibility and total disdain for the overweening (and dare I say overpreening) paradigmatic intellectualism of our own fin-de-siecle."
1,Much Ado About Nothing,"Simply put: Don't bother. If your'e looking for history, look somewhere else. This book was not only about garbage, it was garbage! Try Rutherford if you want history."
2,Can't recommend,"'Underworld' is an empty vessel: a posturing, self conscious and intellectual drudge."
1,Boring,"Some scenes in ""Underworld"" are fascinating, others lengthy or straight boring. To me, they don't seem to jointly form a coherent picture (apart from the obvious fact that they span the cold war period). I don't know why this book is celebrated the way it is celebrated. I like other contemporary novels, e.g. ""Gravity's Rainbow"", ""American Psycho"", and some Palahniuk novels, far better."
4,page counters,"I found this book completely worth the time it took me to read it. And may I point out to all the people who gripe about ""800 pages"" that the pages are printed in a large typeface with lots of white space. It isn't as long as it looks. And why do you all want Don DeLillo, of all people, to write short linear novels with real easy plots? Appreciate him for what he does do."
3,Whether you like this depends on who you are.,"Why the diversity of reviews for this book? I wonder if it's something where lit majors love it, general readers hate it, if boomers love it and Xers hate it, and so on. DeLillo is speaking to the American experience, but only through a particular set of lenses. If you identify with him, this book will resonate with you. But if you don't share his perspective, you probably won't like this book."
4,Cold war era ennui,"Delillo, in his fashion, has written a vaulting piece of historical hyperbole. Perhaps his opus, the best of this novel is in the mordant descriptions, the evocations of family life, and the volleying conversations. However, there is little of a standard plot, and the rewards of a thorough reading may only come for those with an interest in the craft of fiction."
1,Turgid,"Its amazing how many people have read some of this book (I dont know ANYONE who has finished it!!) and are too chicken to admit that it is so awful. I am convinced that the critics who lauded the book are having us on. (Best book since Ulysses, oh yeah has anyone actually READ Ulysses?)Turgid self indulgent and pointless twaddle, one of the worst books I have EVER read."
1,I've never met a book I didn't like at all...until now.,"I don't ask much from a novel. Give me a tangible plot, some coherent paragraphs, decent dialogue and characters with reasonable definition, and I'll wade through it somehow. Particularly when Newsweek went into rhapsodies over it, and even the promotional reviewers in Amazon rated it the Book of the Century. So, what went wrong? My wife, a woman of very good taste and a liberal attitude, got to page 263 and gave up; I lasted for a few pages more. Tell you what I'm going to do--I'll stash this one on our bulging bookshelves for a year or so, and then I'll try it again. I hate to see the twenty bucks go to a complete waste."
2,"It took 6 months, but I finished it!","I read this book based on the initial review and recommendations of various columnists. It was generally interesting but in the final analysis, I would say not worth the effort. I was unimpressed with the writing style which I felt was overly descriptive with no real connection to the plot. Although I would not recommend this book, I felt that there were some elements of the story and the writing that were excellent. My ultimate regret is that the book as a whole did not live up to the first chapter's tantalizing introduction."
3,The Late (20thC) Almost Great American Novel?,"The Late (20thC) Great American Novel? Along with most other reviewers I found this to be an awesomely well written book. However, call me a child of the TV age, but the wandering plot left me frustrated. To avoid going on and on let me say in summary(how about halving the word maximum Amazon?), any page of this book is as good as anything being written, but in it's totality, few books have left me as frustrated and with such a feeling that the author had just stopped one day"
1,Awful,"I tried to get my brand new puppy to poop on this book, but even he was smart enough not to go near it. Good boy!!!!"
3,Trouble staying connected,"I have had a regular cable modem and a separate router for about 5 years. After a lightning storm, both my cable modem and router no longer worked. I decided to replace the two of them with just a wireless cable modem. I like the two in one feature. But Everytime my 2.4 GHZ cordless phone rings, my wireless connection drops on my laptop. And I'm always having to do ipconfig/renew if I haven't surfed the internet in over an hour. I didn't have any of these problems when I just had a cable modem and router."
4,Motorola SurfBoard Wireless Cable Modem Gateway,"This was a good price for this product and I am happy with product. The only issue I had was that it was a bit difficult to install (not the hardware, but getting my computers connected). It isn't as easy as the Linksys routers, but this model looks better and takes care of eliminating one piece of equipment from my desktop.Overall I am happy with this product."
4,Reliable Modem!,"I have been using the Motorola modem for couple months now. Overall I am happy with the modem It is reliable and I hadn't any dropped connection throughout the house. The only shortcoming was the complicated set up, it took me a while to get it to work with my other devices."
5,"Buy this, not the Linksys!","We've been using this modem for about 2 weeks now, and it works great! Had a Linksys before and it was HORRIBLE, constantly dropping and often not working at all (even though all the modem lights indicated otherwise). Thought about renting a modem from comcast, but am glad we bought this one. The motorola was easy to install (and I'm no IT genius), just a call to comcast and we were online. Set up on my Dell laptop, but also works fine on the household's Mac. I frequently work from home and VPN into our network, but haven't had any problems."
1,OLD TECHNOLOGY DO NOT BUY,"Please note that a lot of these reviews are from 2005. DO NOT BUY THIS MODEM. 64/128bit WEP encryption has long been broken. The current standard is WPA2. Pay attention to the dates of reviews before considering paying this much money for an out-dated product. You might as well not have network security, because anyone who even has half a clue what they are doing can break your security algorithm."
2,Too slow,The modem is well made but it's simply too slow by today's standards. I purchased it to use in my home office but I'm not using it as it's too slow to be practical. I tried to return it but it was one day after the 30 day window so stuck with it for now.
1,Product Designed to Fail,"This Polder timer worked fine when I bought it two years ago.Recently, the loud alarm grew softer and softer and now makes only a tiny noise difficult to hear.Also, the vibrator or shaker alarm no longer works. This product is not durable."
1,WHAT GOES ON?,"What goes on here? The line ""contains unreleased live and studio music"" is totally wrong!!! There is no live music at all and the studio tracks have all been released previously.The live ""clips"" of the early band are the same 2 or 3 15 second shots with no sound shown a few times.A picture book would give the same look at the band menbers and the various memorabilia.The Mo and Doug Yule interviews are interesting.It was also nice to see what a toe-f@@ker looks like - listen to Lou's ""Take No Prisoners""No Lou Reed. No John Cale.I wish I had waited to buy it used instead of pre-ordering it."
1,Is this new?,"OK, I'm a sucker for a good formula read, and I enjoy the gruff older cowboy and the wholesome waif books of Diana Palmer. With Heartbreaker, the good formula unfortunately went wrong. The characters were so predictable that I continually checked the publication date, wondering if Heartbreaker was a reprint. If you too like classic Diana Palmer, reread Calhoun."
3,Hero to Hate!,"I've read alot of Diana Palmers books and have to admit I think most of her heros I wouldn't give the time of day. They are macho conceited arrogant jerks. Why Tellie was so taken with J.B. I couldn't figure out. He has her placed in foster care,then she's attacked and he decides to just dump her on his sister. Tellie works her way through college without family support other than JB's sister. He doesn't even acknowledge her success. She idolizes him and he walks all over her feelings. After the things he said to her when she tried to tell him about his sisters heart attack,I couldn't believe she forgave the terrible things he said. Talk about ruthless apalling men. Some women just asked to be hurt.All in all the book was ok but I have read better."
3,It's ok,"I LOVE DIANA PALMER'S BOOKS, but this one was not what I expected. The heroine is loveable, but the hero.....My Gosh! what I didn't think was beliaveble was when Tellie goes to college again after all JB did to her, and he suddenly appears and she forgives him..... come on!!! and he went there out of the blue, and they live happily everafter.... hmmmmm.Anyway, it was ok if you like sad stories, because trust me, this one is!I would love to hear more about the secondary characters, like Marge and Grange."
2,The Last Mermaid,"It's really a collection of 3 stories that are all sort of related, but in essence it's boring and not very well developed."
4,lightening fast delivery,This book was recommended to me and I was pleased to find it right away on Amazon and to have such prompt delivery.
