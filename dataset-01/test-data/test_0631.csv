2,Very Cheaply Made,"After only a week the right ear stopped working randomly and I'd have to fiddle with the cord to get it to kick back in. I had these for less than a month when they dropped from the gym bench in the locker room on to the floor and literally shattered. Both ear pieces broke out of the band with only the wiring left holding them in. These are cheap and I would not recommend them, you can do better for cheaper.Sound quality was decent enough to not give them 1 star."
4,Good Looking,"It looks great, but be careful. They are $3.50 EACH. The picture made it look like you would get 4. Caveat Emptor."
5,The Teacher Librarian: The Journal for School Library Professionals,"A profile of All About Me, has appeared in The Teacher Librarian: The Journal for School Library Professionals, June 2006 issue."
1,DO NOT BUY!,"After only 3 weeks of buying this controller, it started to have malnfunctions. The worst problem was when the joystick is used, it jerks the view up. Do not buy!"
2,Too big and not durable enough,"The Astro Pad is a big controller, especially when compared to controllers on other systems...but the main problem lies with durability. With time one can become accustomed to the feel of the controller, but both the pad and the analog stick break within a few months of playing. This may not be a big issue if you are only a casual game player, but for those who need a durable controller that will endure the rigorous play style of 2D fighting games such as Marvel Vs. Capcom or Street Fighter 3 will be sorely disappointed. Unless you desperately need a Dreamcast replacement controller, I can't recommend the Astro Pad."
1,No Exercises At The End Of Chapters.,Warning: Do not purchase this book if you want to Learn PERL. This book has no exercises.
1,Long boring mess,"In early 1989, NWA fans were seriously into 3 differetn wrestlers.....STING, LEX LUGER, and BARRY WINDHAM. Sadly, all 3 are tossed into meaningless undercard filler(as are most of the people on the card), to make room for the hour-long match between Ric Flair and Rick Steamboat for the World Title. If you were wondering ""What would a 1-hour match between 2 injured 45-year-olds be like?"" then pick up this video now. Otherwise avoid at all costs."
1,Horrid,"My twin two year old sons love all things Thomas, so I scooped this book up at a brick and mortar retailer. What a mistake! The story makes little sense, the illustrations lack the charm that the Thomas books normally have, and the magical plotline is out of character for the series."
1,Very weak illustrations,"This book uses digital illustrations (done with a computer, rather than paint, or photos of models, like most other Thomas books are done), and they are extremely weak. There is little sense of space, light, atmosphere-- it looks like a low-budget video game. The worst. The story is not much better."
3,Wyatt's review,"I just got this book,so I havent read it yet. I read what other people think about it however,and it seems like a pretty good book. I don't like to read but if I have too I want it to be a funny book or a book about cars. I think I am going to stick with this book."
3,Dworkin,"This book definitely provides background and enlightenment on the topic of avant-garde works. However, he goes about this in an interesting manner because he uses terms and describes works that the general public is not necessarily familiar with. He does attempt to provide image inserts and define his vague terms, but sometimes one's mind is too caught up trying to understand his complex sentences to get the bigger picture. This work is for someone who is interested in learning about avant-garde work and is willing to do the extra work to understand what is being said."
5,Excellent toy,My daughter wanted a life like baby. This was the only not ugly baby which moved or talked. Every friend she has falls in love with it too. I am really glad we got her and I would've bought her sooner if I knew she existed.
5,It works for me !!,"I've tried many different programs and this is the one that really helped me most. It gradually guided you to increase your vocabularies and to understand basic grammar in an non-intimidating way. However, as a visual learner, it would be a huge plus if I could also have the lesson book to read along(the booklet included is not a lesson guide). Still, I'll recommend this to anyone who wants to learn Spanish."
3,Item not complete,Was working my way through the cds and when I went to put them on my ipod I found that some of them were missing. This is a great disappointment as I would never do this to anyone.
4,"Love the product, but you're still a beginner","I enjoyed using pimsleur for every language to useLevel IV brings new words and conversations with the same method we know and loveAside from the price tag, the biggest con is that even after finishing level IV you are still a beginnerTried this, ""learn like crazy,"" and ""Story time language learning""If you've done level 1 of pimsluer, i recommend using ""Story time"" (its a download product here on amazon)They sell a lesson at a time and it is much faster paced than pimsluerit was apperantly developed for people who have already completed another language programafter comaparing the two, you could finish levels 1-4 of pimsleur and you would still need to start on lesson 1 with ""Story Time""try itits only 2 bucks a lessoni'm hoping they start releasing more lessons as it seems that what ever they have out is incompletecheers"
5,Best Seller 5 star book,The Rescue Season is a great book.It is a true tale of the dangerous beauty and nature and the energetic men who live in the greatest heroic tradition as they risk their lives in unimaginable ways on behalf of strangers. You should read this book because it is very exciting and thrilling.
1,Jumbled History,"This book claims to give a history of dominated cultures, but it is not written like a history book at all. The dates in this book go back and forth and you can't tell what is happening when. The different chapters are divided by races and there is no overlapping. For example: you can't tell when African Americans are experiencing segregation in schools in comparison to Native Americans. Also chapters end without any conclusion or resolution and Spring offers a paragraph ""conclusion"" to attempt to tie each chapter to the preceding chapters. This is a terrible book- save your time and you money and don't read it!"
5,Speaker wires,Needed new speaker wires to run our Karaoke system. These worked great ! And reasonably priced.!Was glad I turned to Amazon.com to help with our needs.
4,Max the Mighty Strikes a Punch,"In this book, the sequel to the book Freak the Mighty is about Max, the main character from the first book, finding a young girl named Rachel, also known as Worm, and finding out that she is being abused by her step father and her mother won't take a stand against the stepfather. Max is given a book by Worm and upon giving it back, he takes Rachel because she is being slapped and is told by her mother to take her away from him. Soon Max is on the run as he is convicted for kidnapping Worm. The step father fools everyone by acting like he never did anything to her and that she loved her and her mother was forced to back him up by him. Now Max is on the run to find Worm's father who is supposedly in Montana while avoiding traitors.I thought that this book was excellent and had a lot of description and drew me in. There is a twist at the end that made my heart jump. I think this didn't have as much heart as Freak the Mighty but was overall a wonderful book. 4 Stars."
4,Nice Music,"The harp music is nice, - I bought both volumes. If I were to do it over I would go with volume 2 and just buy the one CD."
2,Consider another brand,I have owned this camera for 16 months. I'd guess I am an average user in respect to how often I use the camera. I have taken extremely good care of it. Not a single mark on it. One day it just stopped working. Wouldn't turn on. It's currently at Minolta to be fixed to the tune of $160. Personally I find this unacceptable. My suggestion is to look at other brands.
2,not as good as expected,"I opened my box, camera was scratched on lcd viewer, was supposed to be NEW condition...then after reading instructions, found that it would not function unless the batteries were like new..took to soccer match as I shoot a lot of sports pics...well, would not focus clearly at all at over 100 yards..all my shots were blurred at this distance...do not like the idea of no protector over the lcd viewer.(also, nearly impossible to see in light) .was obviously scratched in shipment as was sitting on it in the box..parts were not included in the box as stated on line...talked with factory rep. told me it should be returned for service,etc..I am waiting on replacement from AMAZON an will see if it is any better, if not, will go back for a different brand, type, etc.."
4,Leadership,"Great story, very enjoyable. Another prospective from a military mine. Definitely worth the purchase, spend the time to read/listen to this book and you will definitely grow after this read."
2,I do not think it helped a bit..not until I set out dicon and traps did I get rid of mice.,"it made a lot of annoying noise,,put it on Silent mode..think it is a waste of money and electricity..not until I put out other stuff to kill vermin was it sucessfull.."
4,Seems to work ok.,A little better than the cheaper brands at the grocery store. Lathers up well and leaves the dog smelling good.
1,A two year old made this game,"The view is awkward and the characters do not respond when you try to ole. Disney would not make the game good, I do not know about anybody else but it is the last Disney product I will ever buy."
1,Stangulation Hazard,"Health Canada has declared neclace teethers as strangulation hazard. Also pieces can break off and be a choking hazard. It may not be a big issue with everyone, but i thought you should know."
4,usa made,"a good product that is still actually made in the usa. shovel was fairly light weight compared to the vintage model this one is replacing. blade has some good heft to it, and can still cut through tough soil. Only complaint is that the handle is plastic and not metal and wood. Will haev to see about hte very long term reliability."
4,Great Problem Solving,This book is extremely helpful in that it balances theory with every day anecdotes. It deals successfully in explaining many of the common problems that we all have with our dogs and suggests methods to solve these problems. I am looking forward to the next book in the series!
1,false premise bugs the reader,"Huh? This is supposed to be a ""legal"" thriller, but it has a very simple fact of law wrong, and it's the premise for the whole book. Non-profit organizations don't have ""shares"" owned by individuals; they belong to the public. So the ownership of this rehab clinic could not have been inherited, or bought or sold, or even disputed as described in this book, all of which is supposed to be the motive for the drama. Couldn't buy anything after that. Strange."
4,Countdown Clock,"I was pleased with the clock. It was smaller than I realized when I ordered but probably better that it was. It is easy to set and has several covers that you can use. I did have a problem where one of the clocks died after about 3 weeks. When I called the company, they provided me a workaround (placing the battery the wrong way, waiting for a few minutes, and then putting back in the correct way). Suposedly this will work in most of the cases. It did not for me but the company is sending me a new replacement clock so very pleased with the customer service and warranty aspects."
3,"going, going, GONE!!!","Not too fancy, easy to set. Makes My day a little brighter when I come into work and it says 350 days, 18 hrs, 59 min and goes to tenths of a second. It makes me feel like time is moving."
2,Great read lacks practical means of application.,"The book does an excellent job making a case for ""q"" as a way of determining market value. All arguments are backed up with charts and stats lending great credibility and insight. But I have one major problem with this book. Though it goes through great lengths to convince you that ""q"" is most reliable tool for tracking valuation, it offers no examples that would be useful to the typical investor. The book fails to list any resources, which a person could reference to obtain the numbers necessary in calculating ""q"". This undermined the very reason why I read the book in the first place. I would rate the book at 2 1/2 stars."
5,So good!,A very good book that I think all young Christians should read! It's a lot better to wait for what God has in store for us than to just do our own thing and hope it works out.
5,excellent,used for relaxation and meditation. Coloring helps me deal with chronic pain and these images are perfect for that.
2,too few wineries covered,"This is not the book for wine lovers who like to plan trips to Napa and Sonoma. Too many photos, not enough wineries. only 60. the ""best"" wineries? that's in the eye of the beholder. still looking for an update to ""Touring the California Wine Country"" which has a short paragraph on each winery and lists them in geographical order."
3,Good.,"I liked the images, it is one of the two books I like by this author. The other is the Black and White acordian sytle book."
2,Too big,"We have many RH vehicles. My boys are all about vehicles, and things that ""go."" This thing is just too darn big to be much fun! They can't ""fly"" it...and although it has many other features, they just aren't into that. They prefer their vehicles.After playing with it at a friend's house, and not being all that impressed for more than a couple of minutes, we decided to buy the Rescue Heroes Dune Buggy and Robotz vehicle. This one just seems like too much ""hype"" for the money."
4,Lot of fun!,This is a great toy. My 3 1/2 year old just got it and it has many different things to play with. There are so many differnt ways to play with this toy i think he'll play with it for a long time - it's big but i think it is a good value.
1,Great little timer however the alarms don't work,"I love the size of this timer. It's perfect for what I need. However, I could not get any of the alarms to work - sound, vibrate, or light. I called the company and went through the alarm process on the phone. Nope. Still didn't work. They said to send it back and they will send me a new one. Hopefully the replacement will arrive soon."
5,Great band!,"I bought this record three years ago and still love it. There 12 song record is even better. I have no idea why Amazon doesn't carry the full length. It' SOOOO good. You can order it through Lumberjack Distribution. You can find them on the Internet. Never had the chance to see them live, but I here they are amazing! I kick myself for missing them at CBGB's a couple of years ago."
2,"Too complicated, too many ingredients","Bistro food is supposed to be simple food... at least that's always been my understanding of it. The recipes require way too many ingredients. I hate it when a recipe requires some sort of seasoning and that seasoning is listed on another page with a whole other list of ingredients.I noticed everyone gave this book 5 stars but for me, it didn't fit my needs or expectations. I would return this book and not recommend it for a male that wants to prep something that is easy to do, requires a minimum of ingredients/shopping/time."
3,"mild, perhaps too mild...","I wanted to like this tea based on the reviews. I found it mild but it tasted a little soapy to me. I won't give up on Numi tea so I hope the next type of oolong I try taste more crisp and fresh.Numi Tea Oriental Beauty, Bai Hao, Loose Oolong Tea, 16-Ounce Bag"
5,Excellent Book!Highly recommend it to all Medical Students.,The book is actually 405 pages. There is a great deal of information presented in a unique fashion which made it more interesting to read. I learned pathology from a different perspective through Dr. Brown's book (Thank you!)and was able to supplement and strengthen any previous knowledge. There were numerous (through out the book) typographical errors which need to be corrected.No erroneous info however. An excellent book.
3,Compared to the Preserved Leomons in Morocco,"Since travelling to Morocco a year and a half ago I have searched for an exact replica of the fabulous preserved lemons served in Moroccan tangines. These were good, the closest yet to the lemons in Morocco, but not as good. They may be the best I can get in the US, however."
4,Good read,"I really enjoy Morgan's books. Her Scottish series are my favorites and this one was no exception. The theme woven throughout this novel was one of forgiveness and renewal of relationships with God first and others second.After being widowed from a man who was mean and abusive, Killian Campbell promises to never let anyone hurt her again. With circumstances out of her control, she meets Ruarc MacDonald and is soon pledged in marriage to him. She fights it at every turn.Ruarc MacDonald is a man accused of killing his first wife and is in a fued with his once best friend Adam Campbell. Ruarc is a bitter highlander who lets his anger and hurt rule his actions and emotions.This is a story of forgiveness and redemption. But as they say on Reading Rainbow, don't take my word for it, read it for yourself. :o)"
1,Not that great,"If you really want to learn about Birth Order, I found ""The Birth Order Book"" by Kevin Leman to be significantly better!"
2,They Melted!!,Bought these to use for our home delivered meals program one of our drivers kept smelling something burning looked down and the outlet was melting. He was afraid it was going to burn his car up. And there were only 2 things plugged into it. Would not recommend buying this item especially for long periods of use as our routes are only about 1-2 hours long and they were already melting.
3,A Lot Of Fun,"This is a good costume, too bad it does not include the wings and gloves. The Disney costume is better, but this quite acceptable."
1,Buzz Lightyear Deluxe,"I ordered this costume for my Grand-son for Christmas. We had Christmas a few days early and he was so very delighted to get this. He adores costumes but I must say I was absolutely infuriated to see that the whole costume was coming apart at the seams after he only had it on for 2 hours! I am very unhappy because it needs to be resewn on almost all seams. With company inhouse, I was not able to even begin to sew it up for him.What a huge waste of money for such a cheaply made outfit!!! I am very disappointed as he is also. Do not order this item!!"
1,Bad by a 10 year old's standard.,"This one is just silly, and geared for an inactive imagination. No real plot that makes one want to continue, and just a waste of paper. I shall not trust the descriptions on the pages anymore, but research elsewhere before buying."
1,Dell soundbar,"I just received this item in the mail. I first noticed it did not come with the outlet plug like it was suppose to, and once i hooked it up to my computer it did not work. very upset and disappointed with this transaction."
3,They didn't include power supply,"I have one of these, love it, but this one they sent with no power supply so I had to return. Useless."
4,Pretty good,"This is a great Meltdown Godzilla figure. Although, the mold isnt quiet as good as the Jpanese one, the paint job is BY FAR BETTER! I dont paticurly own this figure, but my freind dose. So overall, a good start for Bandi, and should be in every Kaiju fan's collection!"
4,New To Me,"I had a hard time finding coconut oil in my area stores, so I turned to my go-to store. The product is easy to use, but I must say the jar seems to be extremely difficult to open after it's replaced. I like that it is also good for hair and skin."
2,Too highly processed?,"I have a problem with oils. I'm fine with butter or meat fats (read lard or duck fat) as long as they are not hydrogenated, but vegetable oils (including virgin olive oil) seem to really disagree with me. I'm not sure what it is about them that makes my body react the way it dose, I suspect its the chemicals and/or high heat that they use. Or it could be the rancidity as vegetable oils have a very short shelf life. I've read lots about oil and fat and I was hoping that coconut oil might be safe for me because its very stable naturally. This is one of the few brands my co-op carried that the books I read said was okay. I had as little of a taste as possible. It has no coconut flavor at all which I liked but I got very sick after trying it. So either coconut oil is a problem or this brand is too highly processed. Either way I'm a little disappointed. Perhaps I should have gone with a higher grade or a more virgin oil."
4,Good for lotion.,I have not use the coconut oil much but what I have used it for it works. I use the coconut oil as lotion and my skin is shiny and soft afterwards.
4,No Oder,"First the order process and delivery was very good.Spectrum Naturals - Coconut Oil Organic, 14 oz Works very well. I bought it for cooking and am very pleased at how well it works. No coconut smell or taste when useing this product. I do not like the coconut smell when I use other coconut oils."
5,Tasty!,I stayed up until four am to finish this awesome book! Having read the third book first and the first book second I was drooling with anticipation to read A Man Betrayed. I was not disappointed. J.V. Jones does a wonderful job of keeping the audience in her grasp all through the book. Skipping between characters pulls the audience into a fevered frenzy of anticipation while waiting to see what happens next!
4,A Very Brave Man,"The true account of a man who gave up a dream job and the business fast track, security, a personal life, and his dream of owning a house to build libraries and schools in the poorest countries and stock them with books. A caring and brilliant businessman. An inspiring and brave story. I love the way he thinks and writes. I had one question throughout the book. Mr. Wood thought he had enough money saved to support himself for about five years. More than five years went by, but he didn't mention how he continued to have the money to feed, house, and clothe himself. He never mentioned collecting a pay check or receiving personal donations.Very inspiring. If you liked this book you will love Three Cups of Tea which is a similar story, but written by a man who started with nothing at all and hadn't the faintest idea how to proceed with building schools."
4,What Did You Do With Your Life?,"Mr. Wood's tale is a fascinating read. Mr. Wood takes us on a journey that leads us to Nepal, Cambodia, Austrailia, China and Vietnam. He was an account executive for Microsoft who happened onto a rundown school while trekking in Nepal. It changed his life and he began changing the lives of the students he helped (collecting books and eventually building Libraries and schools). He started his ""room to read"" program on a shoestring budget and a lot of determination. The story is interesting but he gets repetitive at times. There is a certain lack of personal insight (I find this to be true in many of these type of accounts)on the author's part. But all in all an ENJOYABLE/ INTERESTING READ!!"
5,Awesome book!,"I couldn't wait to catch the train in the morning just to squeeze a few extra pages of this book in.Checked all the boxes. Entrepreneurship, business, charity, travel and culture. Written by a skilled author with a great sense of humor, an obvious passion for his work and an enduring curiosity about the world and its people. His positive and pragmatic attitude to providing education to the world is inspiring."
3,DVD review,"Good quality recording and playback. However, the progressive scan function was defective so I had to return the unit to Samsung on 12/5/06. I have yet to get it back a month later. That's very poor service. The other negative aspect of this machine is that the auto clock function does not work if the unit is plugged into a cable box. I have another recorder that is 4 years old and I don't have that problem with it. For a state of the art recorder, I think you can do better. Overall I am a little disappointed with the service and shortcomings of this unit."
3,Samsung DVD-R145 Recorder,"Good: The upconvert works well much better than my other Toshiba unit. Upscaled TV/DVD picture was bright and crisper.Improvement Area:1. With the unit off (not unplugged) and the included IR channel changer for cable boxes, the IR device sends out a sequencing channel changing command. That is your cable box will start incrementing channels starting at 1,2,3,4.... Annoying. Called Samsung to report issue, no fix acknowledged.2. The fastest the unit will fastforward or rewind is significantly slower than other DVD players I've owned. The fastest setting is so slow, that I review to chapter marks."
5,Entertaining introduction to industry jargon,"One of the things that distinguishes most industries is some form of jargon used by the insiders. Here to rescue the newbie is a compendium of terms and definitions from the world of business. Besides general jargon that is common among most businesses like alpha dog and peanut gallery it includes terms specific to particular industries such as Investments, Accounting and Tax, Debt and Banking, Legal, Real Estate, Insurance, Contracts, Business Planning, Acquisitions, and Divestitures. This is fascinating reading with lots of terms I've heard before and even more that are entirely new to me. Done in an interesting style that leaves you unable to put the book down as you read entry after entry it is a fun and informative read. Green Weenies and Due Diligence is highly recommended for anyone in the business world who wants to understand the slang used in their industry."
3,Very Nice,"An excellent product: very nice quality, nice pattern... the only think lacking is salad bowls.I've not been able to find matching salad bowls -- if they were included, this would be a 5-star must have. (And if anyone knows how to get those matching bowls, I'd appreciate posting the info here!)"
1,Way too depressing and sad,"Unlike the other reviewers, both my daughter and I found this book to be too depressing and too sad. The last thing we want to do is spend free time reading stories that are heart-wrenching to the point of exasperation! (Granted, there are exceptions.) My daughter (age 10) cried during and after reading each of the several stories she tried. NOT the best bedtime fare. I would not recommend this book, especially to children."
5,It Inspired and Comforted Me!,"I really loved your book! It inspired me and comforted me. After reading it, I took a real good look at my life and I changed some things. Your book also showed me a different way to write. Thank you for a great gift."
4,Excellent,This leather case is ALMOST perfect. The only thing that is missing is there is no opening for the mini-usb for charging.
5,great buy,This product is a great buy. It appears just as shown in photo. Great quality. I will order again from this company.
1,"No poems, just the Intro","I would give this Zero stars if I could. No poems, just the intro and the table of contents. Don't download. Don't download."
3,"Intriguing Concept, But Is It Practical?","Describes an approach to market research that involves highly structured product/service user interviews and vetting. What the author fails to explain, however, is the somewhat dubious notion that companies will be able to secure the participation of numerous customers and non-customers in this very time-consuming process."
4,"A Quick, Easy Guide Worth the Money","I was looking for a dictionary with maximum characters, and I found this one to be a great resource if you can pick out the character radical right away. It's much quicker than my other dictionary, and used in tandem with something like Oxford's Chinese Dictionary, it can cover all the bases of most characters you will encounter. My main need was a book that gave me less common characters used to transliterate foreign names and for characters that I couldn't find in my main dictionary. This book breaks down the radicals so simply that I think it makes them easier to learn as well. If you don't know the radical or can't easily identify it, I found I still needed the Oxford. As for the other reviewers who complained about the printing and the fact that it was self-published, I would recommend this book anyway because it doesn't look bad at all and the information is well worth the purchase."
1,Terrible!,"I bought this from Motherhood and hated it!!! It is too narrow and so puts a lot of pressure on your hips and pelvic bones, which any pregnant lady knows- our bones are already moving and don't need more help!! The mother ez belt was fabulous though!! I wore it for the last 4 months!!! Forget about this one though!!!!"
5,"WOW - great book!!! Wonderful art, beautiful color pics","This is really a wonderful book! I bought it because it looked like it had nice color pictures, and it turned out they're fantastic! I'm an artist and I just LOVE these beautiful painted houses. It also looks like it has a lot of good information in the narrative, but so far all I've done is look at the great color pics. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"
2,DON'T BUY IF YOUR CHILD LIKES TO TAKE THINGS APART!!,"I was so disappointed. Every little piece comes off. THe day after Christmas I came upstairs and my girls literally had taken it all the way down to ""brand new from the box"" mode. Even if you brush against it it'll fall apart. I do love the ponies that came with it. We bought a special set that came with 3 additional ponies.My kids love it when they play with it, otherwise we wouldn't keep it around."
1,Teaches romanized Hindi -- Very unhelpful,"Apart from a TWO PAGE section headed ""Reading Hindi Script"" in which the Hindi alphabet is presented, this book does not teach you how to read or write Hindi! This little book of 143 pages of big type teaches conversational Hindi with transliterations (into the English alphabet) only. After completing this course you will not be able to read any Hindi signs, menus or periodicals, and you will have no clue as to how to write Hindi."
5,polar,"Product arrived before expected. It fits perfectly with the monitor we already had, just needed a smaller strap."
2,how big does thing need to be???,"if anyone still has a creative zen...my LCD broke a while back...just know that this is a bulky protection unit. Its noisy when you push buttons, the side clamps are plastic, and just overall feels awkward. Just get an ""invisible shield"" from Zagg for the front and it will be fine. The mp3 player is bulky enough as is."
4,Bathroom Fan Eave Vent,Vent was easy to instal with wood screws into the metal flange in the wood eave. Product was as descibed and quickly arrived at my home.
1,soffit vent maybe,not a fan vent.it is a soffit vent w/ some alum.flashing attached. no damper.WASTE OF MONEY. i know why there is no picture w/ it
4,Play at the same time with your kids (two-player co-op),"There is already a lot said in the other reviews, so I thought I would solely focus on one of the great features of this game. The co-op mode. My son is 5, he still struggles with some of the battles in this game. But you can just fire up another controller and join the battle with your kid. We have a blast trying to smash more than the other. We each try different aliens to see who is better.It is a lot of fun with some great bonding.The game itself is OK, the the ability to play together is such a plus!!!"
3,My kids like it,"My two kids love Ben 10. They got so excited to get this game. It is fun to play, and easy for them, they are 3 and 5 years old. The downside is that the game isn't that long. My husband and I barely helped them with it, they had limited playing tome, and yet they still finished the whole game themselves within a week. I just wish it was longer. They now just go back and replay all of the levels. There's nothing new to do on it."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"Purchased this clock for our outdoor patio. From the moment we hung it up, it didn't keep time very well. On inspection, noticed the clock hands were hitting the glass. Fixed that, worked for a while, then again, started losing time. Replaced battery, left in house for observation and when we were convinced it was working, hung it back outside. Shortly afterwards, it stopped working completely. In the trash it goes."
1,A big disappointment,"I thought this would help me learn how to use InstallShield Developer. I read it cover to cover and learned almost nothing of use. Areas where I really needed help, like doing patches and upgrades were mentioned, so you might be mislead into thinking there'd be something there. In fact, no useful information is provided about that, unless you don't know what a patch is. Ok, a patch is an incremental upgrade to an existing installation. Now you don't need to buy the book. (You can send the 50 bucks to me if you'd like).It was a waste of my companies money and my time."
1,1 year DONE,"I bought 2 of those lamps , both broke within a year, the pastic is cheap , this shouldn't happen in the first year !!! The plastic snaped above the base , strange !!I would recomend the real wood walnut finish ,wood lasts longer than cheap plastic ,Grandrich ES-217 27-Watt Full Spectrum Desk Lamp, same lamp diffrent manuf. a bit more expensive.I just bought this one , hope is a better one , my friend has one for 5 years still working , no brake in the wood !!!"
2,"Bright, even light, BUT cheap plastic poles broke","Lamp worked great; provided great even illumination across my computer desk work area. HOWEVER, the flimsy plastic pole that attaches directly to the base snapped while I was adjusting the lamp head. Even before it broke, the plastic pole continually flexed, leading me to me very cautious when moving the lamp head. Despite my efforts, the continuous stress from the weight of the upper lamp head assembly caused structural fatigue and ultimate failure of the plastic vertical lamp pole.I am requesting a replacement lamp assembly."
2,Exceedingly dull!!!,More about the machinations of the music business in regard to the band. The anecdotes about them are very dull and the book fails to paint a picture of a band that was supposedly so outrageous. I wanted rock n' roll debauchery and instead was lulled to sleep....Boring!
5,The Phat Pack,This is one HOT big band. Every solo is incredible. And the ensemble sound on every tune is as tight as any jazz ensemble I've ever heard. Flame on!
5,Phat Pack,"If you're reading this page (and reviews) then you must have some sort of interest in the band. It would be a big mistake to pass up on this CD. It's incredible. At times it's hard to tell that more than one sax, or trumpet, or trombone is being played. The unison is incredible. This is ""must have"" at it's best. I give it 5 stars only because I can't give it 6."
5,Season 5,"i am so excited about this dvd coming out! one of the reasons being that episode 22, All By Herself aired the day i was born. Thank you Shout Factory for releasing seasons 4 and 5!!!"
2,"Could be a good book, but there are too many errors","The most annoying thing in that book is there are too many bugs. The commands are incorrect, picutures have wrong descriptions, and some tests have wrong answers (which makes you confused about your knowledge)! The good thing is there are many config examples, but again, all of them are very similar and often unnesscessary. All of this is also true for enclosed CD-ROM - there are many wrong answers in practice tests, and the intro which starts after inserting the CD crashes immediately (tested on Windows XP and Windows 98)."
1,Guaranteed to FAIL the exam if you use this....,"This isn't much of a review, but my ccnp friend has taken the Cisco MPLS exam OVER 6 times so far and failed every time. (I keep telling him to get some other books. Duh!)...maybe Cisco booby-trapped their exam so readers of THIS book will never get to 85% to pass ;-)"
3,OK Roy Wood,"Fans of Roy Wood will want to have this disc, but while it is filled with good to very good songs, if you are like me, you may have trouble with the late 70's slick pop production."
2,Way too expansive,"Next time I need the thick gaskets, I'll just glue two cheaper gaskets together. These are nice because they have a stiff reinforcement sandwiched in between, but the price was ridiculous!"
2,Crap,"These are B movies. There was some rule in the 80's that if you are making a bad movie you must have Marc Singer. Stupid plot? Unrealistic situation? Monster that made the audiance laugh? Get Marc on the phone.Terror within takes place after a virus wipes out civilisation. The monsters are all male and reproduce by impregnating human females. A bit like the cast of Jersey Shore.Dead Space predates the game so don't blame Marc for that. Marc is a Han Solo type that gets a distress call from a lab full of morons. Also, travel outside the lab on the planet requires a protective suit that is white and only lasts 20 minutes. I just wonder if it could be longer if it had a mask.Basically, get drunk and wish for Ed Wood."
1,bowie: stage is awful,i do love all things bowie but this album is god awful.do yourself a favor and get your hands on david live.it is spectacular.
3,Monkey Multiplier,"Works fairly well but with all charts or games that supply the answer for you, there could be little learning going on UNLESS the child uses it to check answers. One other use of the multiplier is to select a product and then try to guess the factors before looking at where the feet are pointing to. I bought this product because I LOVED the monkey math balance toy. That one is great for figuring out missing addends. It also visually reinforces the idea that both sides of an equation MUST be balanced (equal). As you might be able to discern, I'm an elementary school teacher. I have used Monkey Math successfully with K-2 grades. I bought the multiplier simply for the fun value. The reason I only gave it 2 stars for durability is that the product answer can be off by a fraction but easily adjusted. However, with a classful of students playing with it, which I have not done yet, I am wondering if it would hold up."
3,HOLOGRAM HORROR,"DARK HOUSE is reminiscent of the original HOUSE ON HAUNTED HILL with Jeffrey Combs replacing Vincent Price.The movie's stereotypical characters just serve as props for the grisly death scenes and the budget limited special effects. nOther than Combs and psycho Diane Salinger, the cast is pretty much cookie cutter. DARK HOUSE is the 3rd FRIGHTFEST Ive viewed and is on par with PIG HUNT and better than the disastrous THE TOMB. 5 TO GO!"
1,Movie was 10 but the disc snapped,"I am very very very pleased with Amazon and am still going to use it.. The movie came on time and on arrival, it was in perfect condition, easy opening. But, I had one problem though, when I was trying to take it out it snapped... When I opened then case, I saw a crack in the disc so I don't know that might how it got snapped... To be competely honest, I would never say that it didn't have something wrong with it... It actually had a crack and it snapped."
3,On the fence......,"We have five guinea pigs, so figuring out how to save money on staples like this is something I think about a lot. I have ordered this product twice, with six bags in each order. The first order arrived in perfect condition, the grass looked and smelled good, and I thought I was really on to something, since the online price is about half what I pay locally. Then the second order arrived, and two of the six bags were moldy and very wet inside the bag. A third bag was not wet, but smelled so strongly of mold that I didn't dare give it to the girls. The other three bags seemed all right, and the piggies ate it all with no ill effects.I haven't ordered again, since I can't decide if I want to play ""guinea pig grass roulette"" again."
2,Tree Houses: You Can Actually Build,I was expecting plans for tree houses. This book gives one example of a few types and the plans are not specific enough.
5,OUTSTANDING,"without question, this is an amazing book for everyone, layman to expert. Some of the tips alone make it the one of the best buys I've made in the past year!"
2,not great,"The book is small and the details very much smaller. I bought the book to help me detail a modern house addition and am extremely dissapointed. There are many pretty photos and the drawings associated with them are presentation drawings, not construction drawings. The book is of of little use to the architect and even less use to the layperson."
5,A direct fit,No problem with fit or quality. A direct fit top quality hose (of course) as you would expect from Gates.
1,If it sounds too good to be true...,"Silly me. After reading all the functions of this product I really believed it would take the place of my microwave, toaster and indoor grill. Not...too bad I only have a B.A. and not an M.A. This product is not at all what it was touted. Very disappointed."
1,Fire Hazard!,"A month ago, I posted a 4-star review of this product. I thought it worked pretty well. It was fast and easy to use and required no pre-heating.Tonight, I woke up to an apartment full of smoke. The unit turned itself on and it was baking itself. The way the unit turns on, I know that it couldn't have been activated by user error -- no careless brush against the control panel would turn it on, as you actually need to press several buttons in order to turn it on. In fact, I hadn't used the oven in about a week -- Yet, there it was, tonight, glowing in the dark kitchen. I pulled the plug. There's a bit of a scorch mark on the wall behind it, but aside from the acrid smoke, I caught it before it did any more damage. I just now did a search on the web, and I've seen several accounts similar to mine.I would feel awful if someone bought the oven on my advice and suffered a fate worse than mine. Please don't buy this oven, or, if you do, keep it unplugged when not in use."
2,Potential Hazard,"Even though I have used this toaster for almost 4 years, the past 2 plus years I have had to always remember to unplug immediately after use. It will come on by its self and remain on at highest heat setting until you catch it and unplug it, or it ""you get the idea"". After reading the other reviews about this same problem, my B&D 150 is now history. It cooked great and I used it every day, but the potential hazard was not worth the risk for me to continue using. Thanks for taking time to read and write reviews, I use the information before purchasing anything online, and in this case making me finally see the light of the day."
4,traverse city asylum,"i was very happy by how fast i received this book and the condition, which was excellent!i really enjoyed the photos, etc about the ""asylum"" as i'm from the t.c. area. i used to work there from '72 to '75. i had to leave due the lay offs..i transfered before then, to oakdale center in lapeer, mi.i only have one complaint about the book....on page 64, ""pyramid builder""...no! that was built by the ""patients"" in the '30's...and it was almost destroyed because it had the word ""asylum"" on one side of it.other than that..excellent! i enjoy books about the area and the old buildings...i have found mistakes in 3 books so far...but...what can you do but try to fix them?"
1,complete rubbish,"Fela is (was) one of the most incredible musicians on the planet, but this is one of those discs that you just don't want. I've never heard a Fela disc I didn't like, but this one made up for that.It is banished at the very bottom of a pile of CD's that are practically unlistenable. Try Beast of NO Nation or Black Man's Cry or any other offering first, but if you haven't heard Fela, you're missing out. Big."
4,Reminder to Breathe,"It was a treat to order this inexpensive video and find it had the Bay Area's own infamous Rodney Yee working his magic to encourage us all to breathe more, and more deeply! It has become my back up when I cannot get to class."
2,Slow ...,"The ending of this one was not worth the wait. It started off very slow. The director wanted to make extra sure we saw what gore there was. Hey audience here is a wound. Let's get a nice close up of it! It was not terrible, but it was not good either."
5,praise from down under,I highly recommend this book to anybody who likes animals AND to anybody who gets a kick from good old fashioned entertaining writing.
5,A wonderful first effort!,"""Lonestar Menagerie"" is a charming and well written blend of personal anecdotes, folklore and facts brought to the reader with great humor in a down to earth easy to read style. The background and depth given to each subject by Mr. Harris is perfection and his beautiful illustrations top the book off nicely. I wait with great anticipation for his future releases."
5,PU-ERH TEA CAPS WEIGHT-LOSS,very good product. I FELT IT HELPED IN MY WEIGHT LOSS PROGRAM. LEARNED ABOUT THE BENEFITS OF PU-ERH ON DR. OZ.Pu-erh Tea Supplement 90 Vegi-caps Weight-loss
1,Card Ruined Iron Man!,"Here's what you need to know about this book: Tony Stark is a mutant. Card takes a simple concept of a brilliant man that wants to help people and turns him into a freak of nature that is only intelligent because of his mutated neural system. What's wrong with being naturally smart?The pace is so fast that it's hard to get involved in the story. Forget Ultimate Iron Man, just go read Iron Man: Extremis."
2,Don't get suckered in by the big name,"This book earned it's two stars solely because of it's art. The writing, despite the name on the cover, is absolutely horrible, and makes me think Card just wrote something really general on a napkin and then let the artist flesh everything out. There's a lot of stupid concepts here, like Tony Stark's healing factor, an explanation for his alcoholism that really takes away from an interesting character, etc. The story is also only HALF of Ultimate Iron Man's origins, ending at a completly inopportune moment, having spent more time establishing a healing factor that Stark shouldn't have as opposed to establishing how he became Iron Man. Avoid this book unless it's given to you as a gift."
4,great pic of suzanne sumers,well my being the celbrity nude hound just had to get some nude pics of suzanne somers and this issue hits the mark great pic of her and well worth buying.
3,Misleading content,"The concept of this workbook is great - but there is a card game referenced to help kids practice, and it's not included. I contacted C.A.S.E. and was told it was a publishing error - the cards have been discontinued (why?!!?!) and the reference to them should not have been included in the workbook. Kind of disappointing."
3,Kyo Keychain,"The only qualm I have with this is that a spot of dirt was above the left eye, in his hair. Otherwise, arrived on time and in good packaging."
2,Significantly dimmer than yellow version,"I purchased a yellow version of this same light, which is significantly brighter than this one. It was also cheaper."
1,garbage,Dont waste your money. The item sent to me dors not work as asdvertized and these jokers refuse to contact me!
3,surprised!,"I've been admiring Spode Christmas Tree china for a few years and deciding if I should add one more set of china to my already existing Villeroy and Boch, Portmeiron, and Lenox patterns. I have one set that is basic ivory white that I use for holidays and add serving pieces, salad plates, etc. in a festive designs. I decided to add the salads and some serving pieces of Spode Xmas Tree this year but when I figured the cost it was going to be less expensive to get the 12-piece which included mugs and dinner plates along with the salads. As I opened the boxes, I was very surprised to find the salad plates are only 8"" compared to the usual 8 1/2"" and the mugs are a 9 oz. cup which is also smaller than usual. I still think the pattern is cute and festive, it just seems strange that the sizes are different than any of my other patterns."
2,Miserable,"I read the first three books before writing a review.All three books make use of dream sequences. This one abuses dream sequences.It left with many questions:1) If the mystics were this powerful, then why didn't turn the Pir and the Dragons into grease spots long ago?2) Why should I care about any of these characters?3) Where are we going?This book jumps another 100 years and drops you into worlds that are vaguely familiar to the ones in the previous novels.I found the narrative disjointed (kind of like driving off a cliff).I didn't know any of these characters and it appeared none of the characters knew much of the characters in the previous books.There is an utter lack of continuity between these books. Internally, I didn't think this book held up at all.I'm sorry I wasted $16."
5,serger,this is nice for the threading of my serger helps me get to the harder spots to reach and easy to use.
2,Ridiculously heavy. Not a good eco option due to weight.,I bought a rubber hose based on a toxicity report on garden products released in 2012 that showed many garden products and tools still contain BPA (the manufacturers are still trying to offload this toxic substance). The report suggested a rubber hose. This hose is too heavy to use for anything other than a house fire. The search continues...anybody have a lead on a silicon garden hose?
1,Pyle of crap. Don't bother,"This unit was a Pyle (of crap) and I returned it. The sound was horrible, the docking station is an accident waiting to happen and it couldn't even fill a 600 sq' room with decent sound. For just a little more $$ I got an AV Now Z-Life PA which is the BOMB. HUGE sound out of a fairly small PA. No docking station, no wheels, no battery, no retractable handle. All the value is in the electronics. It fits in an Alligator wheeled conga drum bag and that's how I cart it around. It comes with a stereo double end to single end cord for MP3 players and it works better than the ridiculous docking station on the Pyle Pro. I say the docking station is ridiculous because you can't see it, you can't feel it and it would be very easy to damage the connector on your MP3 trying to find the connection."
4,Did the job with ease.,The system gave a great sound for the ceremony.Easy to set up and use and with my ipad. I was able to provide a system for the Ceremony with no cords. Mic sounded good except when the officiant covered the base of the mic where the receiver is and it started to cut out.
3,decent for room of 50 people,microphone works ok.. not the best. but for the price its decent. Like the fact it has a battery back up. weights a bit much though and wonder if you really need a battery.Allows you to plug in ipod to play musicsound is decent.. but you have to talk close to the mic to ensure you hear the person.
2,"It is not worth the price, very disappointed","I have purchased various videos (DVD and Bluray) in both Marvel and DC, and hit disappointments in both.For this one, I was looking forward to the great animation of the prior movies, but this fell way short, with scenes of people with only their mouths and an arm, that moved, or a still that zoomed in and out.This is the first motion comic I have bought, and now will wait until I see the reviews before I will purchase again.Shame on Marvel for cheating their fans."
1,Do people really wear ties like this?,"In the spectrum of men's fashion, novelty ties are somewhere between cut-off jeans and swastika armbands."
5,great intro to picasso for kids,i used this to start a picasso unit with my 2nd and 3rd graders. they loved it! it was interesting and engaging and it didn't dumb things down for them. great way to start the project!
5,Should be required reading,"This is a very powerful book that should be required reading for every high school student.Victor Herman was the son of a Marxist union organizer who moved his family to the Soviet Union to help set up the Ford factories. The horrors that the family, and especially Victor, had to put up with are inhuman, but typical of totalitarian societies. It's hard to believe that anybody would have the will and ability to live through all that they had to put up with.I fear that this is what will happen to the U.S, in an Obamanation."
3,"Easy install, but mine quit working after about 1 year.","I loved the ease of installation and the fact it just plugged in to existing wiring perfectly. Maybe a rare incidence but mine stopped working after a year and even though vehicle and vehicle lights were off, the trailer lights stayed on. They are on every second the plugs are connected. Drained battery."
4,Good introduction,"I received this book as a gift. I had already been acting for a while, so some of the subjects I was already aware of. The book is a relatively quick read, but enjoyable. It covers basic things, like headshots, resumes, etc. I was most impressed by a small list of colleges with an excellent performing arts program. It covers a lot of topics, but nothing too thoroughly--like I said, a good beginner's book to open up the world of acting to someone who is unfamiliar with it. If you are looking for an in-depth history, technique, etc., this is not a wise choice. This is a fun book overall, and it definitely covers a lot of material."
4,Aloha!,"Wanted to make a Hawaiian Quilt, and this book had just what I was looking for. Great instructions. Can't wait to start this quilt."
4,Solid Stroller,"I purchased this for my newborn. It was a great stroller and not too difficult to assemble. The only three drawbacks I had were:(1) it is a heavy stroller. If you are in an urban area and take a lot of public transportation, I wouldn't recommend it. I often times opted to walk instead of trying to fold it while holding the baby to get on the bus or subway.(2) with the handle in the ""baby face you mode"", it was difficult to steer and I kept stepping into the wheels (the front wheel-base is closer together than the rear).(3) no peekaboo window.Otherwise a solid, stylish, sturdy stroller."
3,We all like a glimse into the lives of others,"Especially those we respect. Like the lives of members of our favorite bands. But what if we find there's nothing to learn?Cabaret Voltaire made good, interesting music. This is an ""inside"" view of their history, but there's little to be found in here. Sorry."
5,Have a limited edition box set?,"[...]""Michael Jackson's Vision will be available in a limited edition deluxe boxed set featuring a 60-page glossy hard-bound book that includes behind-the-scenes photos from Michael's personal archives.""Does anyone know where to buy that limited edition?? Does it as same as that item in amazon?"
4,I would buy this except....,"only reason i wouldnt buy this is its not fully complete. its suppose to be his full uncut short films and yet its missing Captain Eo and the mini movie he did with Stan Winston to promote blood on the dancefloor GHOST. not the music video listed the 35 minute short film which is amazing! other than that, its pretty much complete and if it had both of those on there, id buy it in a heart beat. so 4 out of 5 stars."
3,Messy lube....,"I received this product on time and all went well with the seller. However, the product it self leaves a lot to be desired. The consistency is sticky and almost a gooey feel to it. It didn't enjoy the application process because it was very messy. However, it is gentle and long lasting.I needed to really wash my hands and shower when I was done. Not a very pleasant experience."
5,Amazing purchase,"Uhaul wanted to charge me over $100 to do the wiring install on the 1998 Jeep Cherokee Class III hitch. I purchased this, removed the back rear panel screws, plugged it in, droppedthe wire down to the hitch, and had it installed in 10 minutes. Do yourself a favor and save the money of having someone else do this simple wiring for you and do it yourself!"
5,"An amazing, FUN COOKBOOK, too bad it's out of print","My mother bought me this cookbook about 20 years ago, and I can tell you this is one of the greatest cookbooks I have ever owned, and certainly the FUNNEST! In this wonderful cookbook you will find all of the ""Secret Sauces"" to your favorite hamburger joints (some of them long out of business, but the taste can live on!), such as ""Burger Chef's"" secret sauce, how to make a ""Big Chef"", How to make a ""Super Chef"", how to make chicken that tastes exactly like KFC, Popeyes, or CHURCH'S fried chicken. This is one of the finest collections of recipes that you'll ever come across, so don't hesitate, don't even think about it, you will cherish this book forever. My copy is in great shape still, and I use it all the time, and on the internet when someone talks about a recipe from some restaurant chain they used to go to years ago and asks for the recipe, I am OFTEN able to look it up and post it for them!!!!!!! Good luck in tracking this one down though!"
2,Extreme nausea,"I started taking these at the recommendation of a naturopathic doctor. I realize that what is in them is great, but I'm not even pregnant and taking them made me throw up! I NEVER throw up. Another naturopathic midwife I talked to said that she doesn't know a single patient who can tolerate them--they apparently upset most everyone's stomach. Beware. I thought I had a stomach made of steel. With food it was almost tolerable, but then I would get diarrhea. Without food, it made me instantly nauseous and made me throw up before I realized it was maybe my new supplement that was making me so sick :("
3,NOT Original Performers!,"The game itself is fun, but if you are expecting to sing with Zac and Vanessa and Ashley, you will be disappointed. The songs are performed by ?? who knows who, but not the original cast. Also, words in the songs have been changed. Example: in Fabulous, Sharpay asks for her ""red leather flip flops"" and ""teal chenille tote"" instead of Jimmy Choo and Prada. Little things, but when your fan has every beat of these songs memorized, they will probably be REALLY bugged by them. Especially the performers part."
5,Great game,What a fun game - one of my daughter's favorites this holiday season. You get to sing along with HSM songs and you are graded in terms of how close you are to hitting all the notes. You can see the actual notes on screen and how close you are to hitting them as you sing. My daughter is 11 and likes to play with all her friends. It took a few tries to get good at it - but it's lots of fun. I can see getting a second mike to do the duets more easily.
2,"Unfun, Mic makes it worth it","The microphone that comes with this bundle is the same one that comes with Rock Band, except that it is branded differently (This one says High School Musical). I bought the game for the microphone and it worked great. However, I decided to give the game an actual try.It was a horrible experience. Unless you know the songs by heart like a young pre-teen girl, you won't have any fun either, because the vocal guide track is set up in a horrible way that fades in and out leaving you wondering where you are in a particular song. On top of that, the visual guide for the lyrics isn't helpful since it's IN the lyrics as opposed to next to or on top of.Buy it for the mic and you'll like it. Buy it for the game at your own peril."
4,Loved it!!!,A great story about a woman finding out what is important in her lifeWould have given it five stars except for the typos (could have been a lot worse) and the ending (which could have been better).
1,Terrible,"This was NOT a good book. The characters did not ""come alive"" and the plot lines were not interesting and at times were confusing or far-fetched."
5,I love this book!,I loved this story so much I wanted more before I was even finished! Luckily Lady Iona is next on the list!
5,loved it,"This book kept my attention, I had a hard time putting it down. Had to find the next book in the series!"
4,"Great workout, happy to find the video and the thighmaster","The VHS is a little ""jumpy"" so you have to constantly adjust the tracking. The Thighmaster was the program I used todrop a lot of weight and tone up back in the early 90's. One of the most successful of many that I tried. This videohelps you get through the exercises and it makes you sweat through them too if you are out of shape.I'd recommend this to anyone who is interested in toning, shaping & losing weight with one program."
1,I haven't had the chance to use it.,I ordered this to go along with a karaoke machine that I bought for my kids for Christmas. I wrapped this quickly before reading the box or even looking at the box as my kids are very snoopy. I didn't realize that it didn't come with a cord. :( I ordered a cord for it however it's not the right cord! I am able to return the cord but it'll cost me more to return the cord then what the product is worth! I wish I would have known that there wasn't a cord with it. It would have been nice if they would suggest the right cord size and male to female ends etc. I'm fairly new to amazon so I don't know all the in's and out's and what all to look for when ordering. I only gave the 1 star as I haven't actually been able to use it yet!!
1,not truthful,"I actually looked at this book as I sat in my midwife's office preparing to give birth to my second child. What a terrible way to depict postpartum women! Please, don't anyone think that a woman who has just had a baby looks like any of these women. The images made me feel insecure and defensive about the way my body was looking at the time and the way I knew it would look in the weeks after I had my son. I would much rather see the REAL mothers with their babies, flab, curves, mushy stomachs and all. THEN and ONLY THEN would we see the pure love and devotion that exists between a mother and her child."
5,Great New Ideas!,"I really like this book, it has some great, creative ideas in it for DIY journals/albums.HOWEVER, I made the mistake of buying this book, & 2 others in the YES, IT'S A SCRAPBOOK series (Creative Albums & The Very Best of Yes, It's a Scrapbook). Don't waste your $$. You could buy The Very Best of Yes, It's a Scrapbook & have all 3 books in 1... There might be a couple of ideas you'd miss out on, but definitely not enough to justify buying all 3. Creative Albums & Decorative Journals are almost identical books, w/ the pages in different order. I really can't believe they call this a series when they're pretty much all the same!"
4,Decorative Journals,"The book has great ideas, but I also have her book titled, ""Yes, It's a Scrapbook"". It has the exact same ideas. I felt cheated that I bought a book with the same information."
2,"A ""movie""? More like a clip show.","My daughter loves Angelina Ballerina and owns pretty much all of the DVDs. Whenever we heard there was going to be a full-length movie, we knew we would have to buy it for her. Unfortunately, this ""movie"" equates to about 30 minutes of new content and another 30 minutes of recycled material from the other DVDs. Many of the song and dance sequences are cut and pasted throughout the film and seen as flashbacks. Needless to say my daughter was very disappointed when she found out that she only got to watch the equivalent of one new episode which the standard DVDs have at least four.In conclusion, if you have kids who are huge Angelina fans, pick this up at your own risk. They'll enjoy the new songs, but expect some disappointment when they start seeing some familiar scenes playing over again. I would recommend waiting for the next DVD that's being released in October."
5,Chilling & Brutal.,"This movie, is a True Story, and that really gives me the creeps. Who in the right mind, would want to eat some one, or be eaten?!?! But for a movie, ot act out a true story, like this, it is amazing. The Acting is great, and the story is Told perfectly. Very Gory, and Bloody. Some parts, are perverted too. lol. I love the Fangoria, Mvoies. you can tell that they put alot into all of their movies. Great Film, check it out, but Not if you have a weak Stomache!"
5,"Good, Simple Instructions","I had no problem using this to fold napkins for Thanksgiving. I did the cardinal's hat (on the cover) and the one that makes a pocket for slipping the silverware into. They came out great and added a lot to the table setting. Small book, maybe 25 different folds -- more than enough for me."
3,Nice but not so easy,"I am great at origami and following instructions, but this is not so easy at it claims. They show you what needs to be done in the step before so you lose track of what's a new instruction, and what's an old instruction. The illustrations are very poorly drawn and you don't know which way is the underside of the napkin. Some ideas are only for paper napkins while others are only for cloth ones. The author should have specified which design works with which type of napkin."
4,Heard it before,"I felt like I had a ""deja-vu"" experience--the soundtrack reminded me of the ""Home Alone"" soundtrack. I checked it out, and, sure enough, John Williams also did the soundtrack for ""Home Alone"". I still enjoyed it, however; it was perfectly suited to the movie."
5,Masterpiece,"John Williams is by far the greatest composer of the age. Numerous masterpieces have secured him this spot, and Harry Potter and the Sorceror's Stone only makes this more evident. Riveting songs with flowing movement and powerful lines leave listeners gasping for more. Hedwig's Theme is my personal favorite, a very beautiful song in it's own right. Overall, a must buy for any serious lover of music."
3,"Not entirely up to snuff, in retrospect","It's obvious the man was still feeling out this Harry Potter thing with this first score. There is a lot of repetition, but by later soundtracks it seems to have been necessary. This soundtrack contains the original, lovely and full settings of the main Harry Potter themes."
3,WILLIAMS PUSHES POTTER ALONG WITH HIS USUAL STYLE,"The ""Harry Potter Soundtrack"" is good. John Williams is back with his usual style - giving us Harry Potter mixed with ""Superman"", ""Star Wars"" and ""Close Encounters"".I am not saying this is a poor soundtrack, just the usual John Williams fare. Williams does have distinction between his soundtracks but his ""same"" style lingers in all of them where you still hear a little ""Star Wars"", ""Superman"", etc.A good soundtrack not great. Why this is getting 5 star reviews is beyond me, it is not a classic, just good fare. Williams brings the music to the story of Harry Potter alive in a pop classic sense.Williams needs new influence in his style, like Michael Nyman ""The Piano"", ""Gattaca"", etc. (who has yet to win an academy award for music score).I am sure Williams will win again at the Oscars for this been there/done that style with just a different twist."
3,Average,"A couple of nice themes, but vintage Williams this is not. Then again, considering the film itself is lacking ideas, it's not surprising that the soundtrack is too.Save your money and buy the staggeringly good Lord of the Rings soundtrack instead."
5,The Picular,I love the eirrie feeling this music gives you when it starts off and ends. It leaves you thinking. I've found it is especially helpful to do my homework and projects while listening to it. Even if you hate Harry Potter you are going to love this C.D.
5,AMAZING!,"I was getting pretty sick of the Star Wars soundtrack my 8 year old son loved. So as soon as I knew John Williams was doing Harry Potter (and heard the new score sample in the preview) I ran out and bought it for him. We weren't disapointed.I highly recomend this CD for kids, adults, cats, dogs, anyone with ears. WHAT A FIND! I have to say he's a tie with Danny Elfman."
2,Good but not for beginners,"Thankfully I had taken a yoga class led by an instructor prior to using this tape. During some of the 'salutation' poses, the pace is too fast for a beginner. Also, Rodney does this movement when he is transitioning from a standing postion to a face-down position on the ground where he puts all of his weight on his hands, lifts his legs off the ground, then extends them out in a push-up like position. Definately not a beginner stance. I think this tape would make most beginners frustrated. I would suggest only doing every-other pose/position during the fast pace movements, and then just modifying his movements as needed."
2,"Not for beginners, unfortunately","This tape was definitely too hard for me. I now understand that it's beginner's Power Yoga, but the word ""beginners"" in the title is a bit misleading. I'm not in the best shape, but I usually push myself to finish a video, but I couldn't do it with this one. I can't do push-ups, and I couldn't think of a reasonable alternative to get from one pose to the next. I'll try again, but maybe after getting a beginner's Yoga (not Power) video."
4,Good basic yoga practice,"After doing this video every morning for several weeks, I could notice I could do more challenging workouts, because I was more flexible, and my body could resist more challenging moves. I think it's a good base for the start of yoga practice and for stretching your body in preparation to any other workout. Then you can move on to something more challenging."
2,HEAR SOME EVIL,"Poor fit,awkward battery pack, minimal performance but low cost. Seems not to work as ordinary headphones without the batteries. Trashing my set today but not a big capital loss."
1,Not really a noise cancellation device,"Ok, sorry to COMPLETELY disagree with other reviews, but I must. These headphones simple dont work. I would send them back if I hadnt destroyed the packaging. They are not terribly comfortable to wear over extended periods of time, like over an hour. The sound quality is very good though, but the realy problem is that the DO NOT WORK AS NOISE CANCELLATION headphones. My ear buds block more outside sound than these (and I'm taling about a $12 pair of skull candy buds). Also, I have another pair of noise cancellation headphones from harbor freight! that work 10x better than these for 1/3 of the price."
5,Slipknot: Inside the Sickness paperback.,Bought this for my littel cousin for her Slipknot collection. She loved the book. Purchased it used cause I couldn't find it in new condition.
2,Not for beginners - Very difficult postures!,"Suzanne Deason's Living Yoga's Lower Body Yoga for beginnersmoves very quickly from one posture to another without the getting the benefits of the posture. She does not pause to like 5 breathes but doe the entire routine in a continues flow that is ""exteme fast"". You have to memorize the postures in advance to keep with her. I been doing yoga for 3 years and still cannot keep up with her fast pace. Some postures are in the immediate poses and she does them fast! I gave the CD to me yoga instructor - who has been doing yoga for 15 years and she like the CD! I purchase it with the Living Art's Rodney Yee for abs and upper body. Rodney two sections move more normally and is good; but I need to get a lower body CD and am looking for one that is of normal pace and more relaxing to the spirit then Suzanne Deason's. Definitely for the accomplished yoga person in my opinion."
4,"Good workout, not intro level","This video does move quickly, and is not intended as an introduction (for that try the Living Arts Begining Yoga tape). When I first started yoga I did not like this tape that much. It moved too quickly for me to get my balance in some of the one leg poses. Now that I have been attending an Ashtanga (aka power /active/ flowing) yoga class a few times a week I like this tape a lot better. A tape is not a substitute for a teacher but this one is a good excercise routine to do when you can't make it to class. Hoever, if you are just starting out and want a lot of explanations or time to work with the poses, choose another video."
2,not for beginners,"I just took a break from doing this dvd to write a review. I'm not new to yoga, but it's been awhile since I routinely have done yoga. I would say this hard for beginners and an advanced dvd. My palms are hurting as I'm writing this because of the lower body exercises so far. I would not recommend this for beginners."
4,New to Yoga,"I am new to yoga and I thought that this was good for beginners. Of course I was not able to move as much as Ms. Deason but I know that it will take some time to be just as good. I felt very relaxed at the end of the tape and I have noticed that I am more flexable. Some of the camera angles were not all that great. Sometimes her back was toward the camera so you really don't get to see the move correctly and that's the only flaw. The modifications at the end were also very helpful, for a beginner."
4,Rolling Back Pack Review,"This back pack is well made. I was looking for a pack that would roll. The handle is long enough that I don't have to bend over to pull it. I'm 5'8"". The wheels I was especially concerned with and this has the durable roller-blade wheels that will last. Those rubber ones didn't last 3 months wheeling through a downtown metroplex every day. There are many compartments, more room inside the largest than I've ever had. I just wish it had something a little more handy for things like bus passes or parking cards. But it seems to be a good quality bag and is helping my back considerably."
3,sturdy backpack but need some improvements,"The backpack is sturdy and I expect it to last a long time. There are 3 features that I do not like and they are as follows:1) There is a protective piece that covers the wheels & supports when it is used as a backpack (so that the wheels/support will not dirty your shirt while using it as a backpack). The piece needs to be bigger - it now barely covers the wheels/supports so the edge of the wheels/support still will dirty your shirt when using as a backpack.2) The front pocket has 2 peep holes that has no purpose other than just for looks. However, this causes rain or water to sip into the pocket wetting the contents.3) The top of the second pocket also has a slit that will let water or liquid to get into that pocket.Otherwise it is a study backpack"
3,Bottom & 1/3 of lower back & side should be some type of hard surface!,"My first impression of this bag was GREAT. It doesn't have as many little nick nack pockets as I would like, but it was definately big and roomy so the lack of little pockets was easy to over look.Now, the problem was that after 10 minutes of rolling it on the first day of use it started to get wear holes along the bottom edges. The holes came from it scrapping the ground when being rolled.I immediately packed it up and mailed it back. I had just assumed that this bag came with the corner guards or plastic lower half on the back and bottom like my previous rolling back packs. I was wrong.If you're just looking for a big backpack this is defiantely it. If you're looking for more, don't get this bag."
2,not pleased,My fourth grader has used this bag for less than 4 weeks and the material is already busted over both wheels. It is much bulkier than it appeared it would be. He says it gets knocked off the hook and stepped on all the time in the coat closet where the kids hang their backpacks. I am not happy with how quickly the material has busted.
2,If you like Laura Ashley...,"So, I was looking for a book with hair-braiding styles that could be admired from all views, not just the back. Something like loose cornrows that would include bangs (that are growing out).I read all the reviews for this book and was encouraged. However, what I found was something straight outta 1985. Softly-lit models with braids that all start with a ponytail and are slightly messy/ casual. They are suggested to be worn with slouchy sweaters or to entwine flowers into. Booorrring! I should have known better than to buy a book that comes with scrunchies.The second star is for the herringbone braid. That's it."
5,New style more popularity,"I used to go to school usually with my hair open, barretted or in a ponytail. Nobody looked at me. After i used these styles in this book 3 guys asked me to a dance. I think this book is awesome if you and your friends are being grouchy or are getting bored this book provides laughs and suprises!PS-look thru this book before a dance!"
5,Hair Braiding,Amazing book. First discovered it at a beautician friend's house. She was using it for ideas to create looks for customers going to proms. I decided to purchase it for my daughter and she's used it ever since to create lovely braided hair styles on herself & others. Step by step visual instruction makes learning various braids & Victorian style bobs easy to master. Glad I bought it.
3,Jazz Fest Mystery,"This was a diverting read mainly for the colorful descriptions of The Big Easy and the central characters. The mystery was acceptable but the ending felt tacked on and was less than gratifying. Still, her central character, female police officer Skip Langdon is interesting and complex enough to want to ride shotgun with as she progresses through the story. The problem for anyone who likes to read about Southern Louisiana and the New Orleans area, is that James Lee Burke owns this territory and so far nobody else has measured up to his skill at describing it."
2,goes on forever,likable characters but move along already. The story could have been told in half the time. Liked the main character.
3,"DON""T GIVE UP ON MISS THORNTON","READERS~~ this book isn't as bad as it's made out to be, but it isn't great. Just skip this one and go on to any other of Elizabeth Thornton's books. I recommend the princess series to start. Excellent author with touching characters and great plot twists. One to add to your historical romance favorites."
2,What a waste of my time!,"Having recently immersed myself in Regencies, I began reading this title. Several hours later I said out loud, ""I am sick and tired of this girl!"" The pace was slow-moving and neither the hero nor the heroine were behaving within the Regency parameters befitting a ""gentleman"" or a ""lady"". All he did was lay down orders that she dramatically flaunted; it was like watching an extremely tedious tennis match. I skipped half the book and read the ending, to find out that even then the same overbearing/lack of trust issues were still active. It really is amazing how her writing has improved through the years and what a shame it is that publishers will re-release a substandard book trying to get a little extra money. It makes me especially glad that I was able to borrow this one and didn't actually have to buy it to find this out. Read her more recent ones-they are MUCH better."
1,First time reader,"This was the first time I read a book by Elizabeth Thornton, and I'm sad to say that it will be the last.From the start I did not like the Earl of Rathbourne. How can somebody think that almost raping a girl is a good way to make her love you? In fact, I did not understand how Dreidre could fall in love with the guy... He didin't do anything, not even a little one, to deserve the love of that girl. He just decided that he was not a rogue anymore and Dreidre is suppose to belive him without any proof.All along the book, Gareth cheats, blackmail, yells, insult, hurt and threatens Dreidre in every possible way. All in the name of ""love"". At the end, the stupid girl loves him...I did not understand the meaning of it... and was angry all along the book."
1,Apologies to everyone else who gave this a single star,"Elizabeth Thornton is a wonderful writer, but she has a few books in her past that she should be trying to live down. This is one of the two worst of her books (""Velvet is the Night"" is her worst and ranks with the worst books I've ever read.) Take the advice of the more eloquent Amazon reviewers and miss this one. This is a reprint and is written in the old form: hero and heroine are both sophomoric and behave badly toward each other until the end when their problems magically disappear and they form a healthy and lasting relationship. Don't waste your time and money on this one, buy ""Shady Lady"" or one of her other new books and enjoy a good read."
4,Worked well on my WJ Jeep,"I bought this for wiring up a 6x12' U-Haul trailer for carrying towing my stuff from Houston, TX to Seattle, WA. It worked flawlessly from the time it was plugged in. Since my '99 WJ was already wired in the back for it, it was as simple as cutting a hole in the grommet and running the wire through it. I might suggest getting the right grommet for the purpose, but I didn't have any trouble modifying what I had."
3,Difficult reading for a novice statistican,"I found the book to be worth the price but very difficult to read. I am a biologist with only an introductory level education in statistics and I couldn't read between the lines well enough to comprehend many of the points that the author was making. In many instances, the reader was provided with a summary of facts or different opinions, but then no conclusions or recommendations were presented. On the other hand, this book covers many very important topics that are not discussed elsewhere."
1,The bottles do not pump as they should,"I was excited to get this gift set and ended up very dissaponted! The bottles made to help with bathing by being a pump bottle, both did not work. Nothing came up the tube and the whole pump popped off!! I live in Hawaii and to ship it back would not be worth it. Regret making this purchase!"
2,Languages are no longer taught like this,"This course is all based on grammar followed by texts to practise the grammar. Some texts are rather odd. In the first lesson Portuguese Maria Helena, from the Algarve, is working in Lisbon as a doctor. She says she cannot speak Portuguese but that does not matter. She is about to learn the language now. Isn't this rather odd? In a reading practice later towards the end of the book there is a text on two convicted criminals that have escaped. I hope I shall not meet them when I am in Portugal.This course may appeal to the older generations from the days when, I am told, grammar was how languages were taught at school. This is now too old-fashioned. I prefer a more modern approach."
5,#1 book LIVING WITH LIMOGES,"LIVING WITH LIMOGES is the first in a series by Dubay on ""collecting Limoges"" UNIQUE CONCEPT I KNOW COLLECTORS WILL ENJOY states Mary Frank Gaston! Wonderful, professional photography, complete descriptions and values under every photograph. A complete alphabetical marks section is located in the back and I love LIVING WITH LIMOGES! Dubay is knowledgeable, intelligent, interesting and her books are well written! (I received her second book ANTIQUE LIMOGES AT HOME and I highly recommend both books by Dubay!!)"
5,Highly Recommend Living With Limoges,"I needed help researching my antique Limoges china set so I called the author directly. Ms Dubay was lovely, informative and answered all of my questions. I was honored to have her help and I ordered her trilogy on collecting Limoges; Living With Limoges, Antique Limoges at Home and Collecting Hand Painted Limoges Porcelain, boxes to Vases. I was very upset that I could not order her books on line and that they are not available in the book shops as they really are the best reference books on Limoges. A must and I highly recommend."
4,Enjoyable,"As a real fan of World War 2 books, I found it very enjoyable. Most chapters, the pages turned effortlessly. There was some inconsistency between chapters in the way they were written. Using a compilation of people's memories provides a great deal of unique information, but doesn't always flow easily. Just the same, warmly recommend it and look forward to reading other titles by the same author."
3,not the best lock out there,"Had my bike stolen in the first week of owning it while using this lock. i give it i a three star because my bike was locked overnight (although it was in a courtyard area that i didn't think people would be prying into), and that made my bike an easier target.if you want to be able to lock your bike up and not really have to worry about where or when you are locking it, this isn't the lock for you. if you just want to lock your bike out in the daylight in areas with lots of people around, this'll probably do the job for you."
1,Bad locking Mechanism,"Similar to another review I've just now read, the locking mechanism simply stopped working. Key turns fine but without effect on the lock. Hopefully Kryptonite will send a new one or even better my money back because I don't see how I can trust it anymore."
3,The lock is fine but the frame mount,is RETARDED. There are too may things wrong with it to list. Don't buy this lock if you plan to mount it to your frame.
1,Easy to break,"This lock can be pretty easily broken. How do I know this? First, I had actually used this lock before my bicycle got stolen off of bike rack when I had securely locked the frame to the loops. Second, I saw some campus maintenance workers cut off this lock (which is very popular on campus) from an abandoned bike. This was done in a couple of minutes using an electric grinder."
1,Do not buy Kryptonite!!!!,It is a certain shame that there are not many other bike lock companies out there other than Kryptonite. I have bought two different kryptonite locks at different times from different stores and they both broke within a month! The keys are difficult to use and often stick. Even something seemingly as fool proof as a strong U lock by kryptonite can fault easily! I dropped it and it bend to the point of no use anymore. Do not buy this lock. It will only cause you heartache and lost money.
5,Love Love Love my Fisher Price Gym!,"Me and my baby simply adore this simple yet so functional gym! The light and sounds and colorful design....My baby girl is mesmorised by it! and it gives me some time for the really important things in life...like doing the dishes :-P**the gym also completes our bouncer, from the same rainforest edition :-)"
2,Very pretty BUT....,"This toy was just the cutest little thing, and I couldn't resist it. It looks like it'd be so much fun, but my daughter doesn't seem to care for it at all. I don't get it. She had a tummy pillow and lots of toys to play with (and she does chew on the chewy toys), but even though it plays tunes, it just doesn't impress her very much. Right now, this toy is in storage. She has had this since she was about three months old, and now that she is nearly six, she still isn't too impressed with it. I have some exotic pets, maybe I will let them play with it. For our purposes, this toy was over-priced for the benefit I'd hoped to get out of it."
5,my daughter loves this!,I just recieved this in the mail yesterday. it was VERY easy to set up and my daughter of 3 months took to it right away (she actually wore herself out and fell asleep under it then woke up later and started playing again lol). i didnt even put the batterys in until later in the day and now she cant get enough. with or without batterys a great product that looks to be pretty duriable and will last a long time. plus alot of the toys are removeable for use while travling. which by the way it folds up nicely and fits in the bag it came with and you can take it just about anywhere.
5,"Awesome, easy entertainment","We purchased this when my daughter was about 3 months old. She's always been really (REALLY) active & interested for her age group, so we were looking for something to keep her entertained for more than a few weeks. This play gym has a mat that we throw in the washer every couple of days, and the toys are easy to clean as well. There are plenty of loops so you can move the toys around, and she LOVES the mirror. It is also very sturdy - my daughter is already breaking toys meant for her age (6 mos), so it's really nice to be able to let her beat the heck out of this without having to worry about things breaking and little pieces of broken toy ending up in her mouth. The lights/music are nice, but don't hold her attention much. She's much more interested in gumming the elephant to death."
4,No complaints,"Our son loves this play mat. We have it at nanas since she baby-sits all day. He gets lots of exercise, the music isn't annoying like some toys are and he loved toys so much (especially the monkey) that we had to buy them for home (https://store.mattel.com/ItemDetail.aspx?cat=140&item=43073)."
3,Stopped working after a month,"My daughter loves this gym, however the lights and music stopped working after about a month. At first we just thought the batteries were dying because we would turn it on and nothing would happen but then it would randomly start playing when no one was around it as though it were possessed. Well, we've tried replacing it with batteries from two seperate packs and neither fixed the problem. I'm disappointed in the quality of the products coming out now."
4,Rainforest Gym,Our grandchild really likes the gym. Even though she is only three months old she took right to it. We believe it will be a posotive influence in her dveloping hand eye coordination and it really helps keep her occupied so her mom can get other things done.
3,Little Disappointed,I was a little disappointed with the baby activated feature of this product. The thing just doesn't work!!!!Otherwise my daughter loves the music and toys!!
5,"good, my boy love it very much","I bought it when my son was one and half month old. He loves it very much, and can lay on it for about 30 minutes. That's very helpful when we have dinners."
3,Not essential,"A well made gym with vibrant colours but it's definitely not a necessity on the list of must have baby items. The mat is slippery so provides little traction/grip. It's also very small so once your child can roll over, this mat provided little coverage. The hanging toys are lovely soft and bright. They are very similar to the toys that come with the mobile. Buy that instead."
3,Not that great,"It's not as big as you would wish it to be. My baby outgrew it very quickly. The butterflies do nothing, you would think that they are going to twirl but they don't. My daughter loves the colors and the monkey, it is very pretty but because it's so small I don't even use it anymore."
4,Great product,"Great for 4 weeks old babies. Love the baby jungle. My baby loves it, he lays and kicks and punches. Use it for his play time."
5,Great playmat,"I recieved this playmat when I had my daughter, it has now moved on to my nephew and it's still in great shape. The colors, animals and shapes make it so much fun. My daughter loved it she would play and kick, now my nephew is doing the same. Great toy."
5,Great Tummy Time Mat!,"Great item, my newborn loves it! My 3 year old is jealous.... Easy to set up, soft material, very colorful, and has fun friends that dangle for him to bat at."
2,Ehhh...no movements,My baby showed NO interest in this mat. I totally regret purchasing this after see my friend purchase the lamaze gym mat. Baby likes moving object to keep their interest and the lamaz gym mat does just that. I only purchased this because of all the high ratings but if I were more experience I would've bought the Lamaze one where the bars moves.
5,daughter loves this thing - didn't know about rattle setting,"My baby was first amazed/amused by the lights at about 2 months. Then she started to grab the spinning paddle attached to the parrot since it's kind of longer. Now she's approaching 5 months and still loves this toy. She grabs and kicks all of the toys and rolled over for the first time from her back to tummy in this thing.I didn't know there were 3 settings. One is music, another is rainforest sounds and the other is motion sensored. For the longest time I thought there was a bad connection when the music would stop playing. So I'd fiddle with it and the music would start up again. Later my brother pointed out to me that it detects movement, which is great because your baby can learn cause and effect. Now it makes sense why there's a picture of a rattle for that setting."
2,Overpriced,This playmat was not worth 52$...at the most maybe $30. My son was not amused but I guess every child is different. I feel it was a total waste of money.
4,Fun Playmat,"Our little guy loves this. We started him at 5 weeks. He would just look at the toys as we moved them around. A week later he was so involved. We can comfortably leave him under the mat for almost 30 min while we grab a snack or get dressed. We haven't even placed the batteries in yet so we assume that will entice him even more. We can easily add more hanging toys or move them around. Such a thrill to hear him hit the toys and make noises. So cute.Just bought batteries. Not really necessary. The butterflies don't work, too bad it would be cute. The music is okay and the lights are cute but my child is more interested in all the other toys."
4,good product,"My 2 month baby girl loves it.However, the mirror easily goes off the red plastic. The design needs improvement. Also, one of the supporters easily fall down. Other features are so far so good."
1,Doesn't work - On any System,"Bought this as a birthday gift for my son.Doesn't work. Was waiting a long time for this gift and it was DOA.Locked up my computer. Didn't work on his either.Called their support line which they did answer fast, but after trying this and that he said it has a bad memory card.I WANT MY MONEY BACK!Don't get stuck in the Nextar quality hole!"
1,Nextar MP3 Player,I had this for about 2 months before it broke. Customer service never returned my emails.
2,Very Disappointed in the Second Edition,"The first edition of this book had many inaccuracies which are too numerous to mention here. I was greatly looking forward to the second edition, and the correction of the many discrepancies that were written in the first edition of Beauty in the B. Unfortunately, this is not the case. The book continues to be innacurate in many ways. For example, there is a picture of Rhoda Scott playing a Hammond B-3000, with a caption saying that it was manufactured by Hammond Suzuki. This organ was never manufactured by Hammond Suzuki. It was made by the old Hammond Organ Company. This inaccurate information was also in the first edition of the book. This is but one of the examples. Mr.Vail would have been well-served to have Alan Young review the entire book before publishing it. The effort of compiling the information for the book is to be commended, but the inaccuracies are too many to overlook."
4,not bad for a wireless mike,The headset works great but the volume and mute controls could have been designed for easier use. I'm getting about 5 to 6 hours per charge instead of the implied 8. I got mine for $10 less than Microsoft's advertised price on Amazon through a search. Definetly worth it at that price just for not being attached to the controller when you want to do something.
5,Sweet!,This wireless headset makes it so much easier and nicer to play. I don't have the silly hair anymore! And I can hear everyone great and they can hear me too.
1,i dont like it,i was not impressed at all with it i bought one and the damn thing didnt even work it wouldnt charge from my xbox so i will never buy another one
2,sounds good - very uncomfortable,"I just got this yesterday and was amazed at how uncomfortable it is. You have to pull your ear through the ""earloop"" instead of just hooking a ring around your ear (like EVERY bluetooth headset for a cellphone). How could Microsoft not notice that this thing is crazy uncomfortable? Also, why not go with a proven method (ear hook) thats been used on millions of headsets? In its defense, the sound quality is good and it hooked up to the xbox 360 with ease. Also 2 earloop sizes are supplied on the headset small and medium. Both of these sizes are too small for my ear. And no, I don't have unusually large ears. I am currently thinking about cutting the bottom half off of the loop and seeing if that works....."
1,Hit & Miss,"NOT RECOMMENDED:This didn't work for me. Bad noisy voice for those listening to me. SUPER BAD BATTERY LIFE. battery dies in an hour, Microsoft does not replace or fix the product. I have also read numerous posts similar to this, I did lend it to a friend and listened to them use it online (we were in same online game) and it seemed to work for them just fine, reception and voice quality-wise.Wish it worked for me. but it didn't. $60 wasted."
2,Erratic Noisy Feedback very frequently,M$ had to know that people would own or live next to people who own devices that would interfere with this thing constantly. I haven't had a freind not complain about the racket it makes that they hear.
3,I hope Microsoft has a good update on it's way.,"I pre-ordered my wireless headset and recieved it yesterday. Right now it's a 3, would be a 5 if Microsoft updates Firmware so that the headset stays connected to my system better. I game about 5-8 feet away from my console, and there is an issue with connectivity??? That's wrong, and I belive a correctable issue - but I would have waited on an update if I would have known. Great product if it would keep it's connection more reliably."
4,Nice But Odd,"As as wireless communicator, this headset is great. Sounds good, works well. However, the earpiece loop is odd and I find myself fiddling with it evertime I put it on and yet to get it to feel just right."
3,Average whodoneit..with original twist,"Catherine Aird's ""Henrietta Who"" is her third mystery(2nd with C.D Sloan), and seems to be about as good as ""Religious Body"". The story goes like this: a woman is killed in a hit-and-run ""accident"", and it comes to light that the dead woman couldn't have been the mother of a woman who is about to turn 21. The young woman, Henrietta, now sets out to find out who she is really is while C.D Sloan and his assistent Crosby try to track down the killer. You get slight hints about who the killer is, but unless you pay very close attention, you won't know until the very end. It's OK, but it reads like it is quite dated."
4,"Good, but no menu","My son loves this program on Sprout, and after seeing the ""one where Stephanie comes to LazyTown"" on live TV, asked repeatedly to see it again. Alas, I had not DVRed that one. This DVD contains the first episode as well as two other. The show is an excellent show for kids with a healthy message. Further, there are parts even I as an adult find humorous; so it's not irritating for grownups to watch. My only complaint, and the reason I didn't give this product five stars, is that there is no main menu to select each episode. I just start it and it goes. Because there is no main menu, the DVD will simply star over by itself if left to run. It seems to me that making a menu wouldn't have been too much trouble or expense..."
5,FANtastic!!!!!!,A MUST FOR EVERY GIANTS FANS COLLECTION!!!!!! Still gives me goosebumps today to watch this today..... I own a copy and recently bought one for my mom for Christmas!!!!
3,Historic World Series,"I haven't seen this yet, since it hasn't been released, but it would be nice to be able to get it with the Texas Rangers on the cover. I know the Giants won the series (I was at all three games in Texas), but Ranger's fans aren't going to want a set with only the Giants on the cover. How about a choice of teams? That's why I'm only giving it three stars. This was Texas' first trip to the World Series, and I think they and their fans deserve more recognition than that. Maybe that's how it's done every year, but since Texas had never been before, I never really noticed. I would love to get this set, but being a Rangers fan, I won't buy it for this very reason. I think MLB will lose a lot of potential sales."
5,GIANTS RULE!,"You must buy this Blu-ray/DVD combo if you love the Giants. Lots of extra stuff, including footage I had never seen before."
4,First Solo Assent of Everest,"This was a fantastic book. Having read at least a dozen other books on Everest and K2 it was nice to read a book that filled me in on the local people and cultures of the Himalaya region. Not only does Messner give a exciting detailed description of his solo climb of the worlds highest mountain(from the north side),but he also gives you knowledge of Tibet and the changes it has been through since the vicious Chinese takeover.Other people may feel that Messner ""whines"" about his stature as a mountainer, but I feel these are just examples of a person who is uncomfortable with our society simply being misunderstood. Messner is one of the worlds most prolific mountaineers,and deserves more respect thean the other reviews here give him. A fantastic book and highly recomended. Great pictures too!"
4,The climber as visionary rock star (no pun intended).,"Messner stays away from technical climbing terminology, which is probably good. He also stays away from detailed descriptions of the climbing, which is probably bad, since climbing details are displaced by fights with his girlfriend, world-weary whining about being a star, and boring quasianthropologic meanderings on the local Tibetan folk.But the story is compelling on the order of the first moon landing, and so survives the shortcomings of Messner's telling."
2,More history than climbing - boring,"I found this book to be too full of history about China, Nepal, and Tibet. It was a somewhat boring read with not that much information about the actual climb and for someone who seems to be almost completely out of it during his final ascent, this guy seems to remember such minute details at the same time. Having read Into Thin Air and The Climb, I found this book horribly dull in comparison."
4,You Little Ripper,great vid. amazing footage and great insight to life on the ASP outside of the usual wave riding scenes seen on most dvd's.
5,A Real Banjo Man!,"Don plays with that drive and tone that you associate with the 1950's. He plays hungry and sings with hillbilly soul. This album has great back up musicians and a nice variety of songs. He does a clawhammer tune or two that is very enjoyable, especially the one about bringing back his old coon dog. I have found ""Things in Life"" worth listening to over and over. I am a banjo player, so you can't necessarily go by what I say..."
5,A classic first puzzle,"I love the Melissa & Doug puzzle collection -- the designs are so cute, the pieces are sturdy and durable and the knobs are great for little fingers."
3,"Too much repetition, better camera angles needed","My husband and I used to practice AM YOGA FOR BEGINNERS on VHS and loved it so much we completely wore out the tape. I was sad the day the tape just stopped working. I was thrilled to find AM YOGA etc on DVD and ordered it. We were hoping for the same workout but realized that was wishful thinking. We were a bit disappointed in the workout as well as the cameraman's angles. For example, I was interested in what Rodney's legs were doing and the focus was on his hands being raised over his head. The camera needed to pull back more so the viewer could see the entire pose. Too much repetition at the beginning that was boring. We will continue to use, I just think more time should have gone into the entire routine,more stretching variety, for example."
2,"Beautiful Scenery but Basically Useless, IMO","The am yoga is beautiful to watch, but you don't even break a sweat or strain or need any effort to do it. I'm not sure, maybe that was the point. The pm is ok, but the scenery isn't nearly as nice. I've never put this video in twice. If you want a real yoga workout that has great instruction and is good for beginner and intermediate alike, try Kathy Smiths's New Yoga. I've done that tape over and over again. I bought yoga am/pm for a change but it was way, way, WAY too easy. But again, the am part is just breathtaking to look at. Great job who ever did that part of the video. Lee probably has better videos."
4,Perfect for Beginners,"Having NEVER taken a yoga class in my life, but actively involved in the gym...I decided to purchase this set (am/pm yoga). I have never been happier with my choice and glad I didn't just jump into a class at the gym. Perfect for the beginner!..."
2,Too slow,"I own several of the Living Arts Yoga tapes, and this was by far my least favorite. I prefer a Power Yoga routine, especially to wake me in the morning, which is what I expected the A.M tape to accomplish. These tapes were too slow and boring for me."
4,The Ultimate Stress Buster!,"I rated this Item a four, but that is only because I did not care for the PM set done by Patricia. It lacked proper explanation and I found her oddly annoying rather than relaxing. In fact, I gave the PM Yoga edition away! Having said that, you should know that the AM yoga lead by Rodney Yee is terrific! It is not only relaxing, but it truly relieves muscle tension in just a short amount of time. You feel energized and ready to greet the day. I suffer from back and neck problems due to an injury. This often causes me terrible tension headaches. Doing AM yoga faithfully not only reduced the pain in my back, but drastically reduced my headaches as well! Rodney's voice is very smooth and relaxing. If you want to alleviate stiffness in the mornings, headaches, or stress, AM yoga is for you!"
1,Do Not Recommend At All,"Neither of these tapes are very good yoga tapes. I find them more frustrating than anything. While the morning tape by Rodney Yee is better than the evening one by Patricia Walden, they are both too fast, do not focus at all on breathing, and do not flow from one pose to the next. With the morning tape I have to stop it constantly to give myself enough time to actually stretch. The few seconds allowed for each position are not nearly adequate. The evening tape is so disjointed that I'm surprised they would try to sell it like this. Nothing flows together and I have to reposition my feet almost every time, which greatly detracts from the experience. I would highly recommend anything from Yoga Zone instead."
4,Good for beginners,"I am a beginner,and found the AM tape relaxed me and got me stretched out good before work. The PM tape is very difficult to do if you don't have good hamstrings. Some of the stuff she does on the tapes is impossible for me, but maybe it's just because I don't have any flexibility. Anyhow, I would definitely recommend these tapes for those looking to start Yoga."
4,Revitalize!,"I especially enjoy the a.m. yoga tape. The p.m. tape is a little difficult because of some of the positions that are assumed that shouldn't be for a beginner. Nonetheless, it gives me something to work on. The a.m. yoga tape has haunting musical beauty to it that can be remembered throughout the day. I definitely get revitalized by both tapes and have to be careful that I don't do the p.m. tape too late in the day. A good value and meant for people who want peace but are also very busy."
3,Very Difficult,Pm Yoga is not for beginners. I ahve never done yoga before and when I tried to do Pm Yoga it was very difficult. The AM yoga is a little easier but you need ot have the equipment to go along with it. This tape seems like a Step 2 tape for beginners. Not the best for someone new to the yoga sensation.
2,Novices beware!,"Although the scenery is beautiful, these are not tapes for newcomers (like myself) to yoga. Yee and Walden neither provide detailed instructions on assuming the poses nor do they detail how to modify the poses for those with less strength and flexibility. There are infrequent reminders to focus on breath control and maintain proper body position. If you already know some of the basic yoga poses, and are looking for an efficient structured work out to start and end your days, then these tapes are for you."
3,Living yoga-am/pm yoga for beginners set,"I don't know how Yoga Magazine could have put these two tapes together for beginners. Rodney Yee's AM video is clearly directed toward the beginner. Patricia Walden's PM video is not. There is no way for the beginner to modify the poses that she does to suit their own flexibility, which is so important in yoga. There are so many wonderful stretching poses that beginners ,who are not athletic can adapt too. Clearly she has no clue to what a beginners limitations are. Also, the video has way too many advertisements - I would recommend a Rodney Yee video for the beginner, but stay clear of Patrician Walden. I should mention that I have been taking Yoga for 6 months. Two classes a week at a beginner and intermediate level."
3,excellent introductory tapes,"Both tapes cover basic poses and stretches and are not too difficult for a beginner. Also, short length of each (15-20 minutes) increases the probability of doing one or the other daily."
2,Don't waste your money if you want to do more than meditate.,"I was a true beginner..never did yoga in my life, so I thought I would start at the beginning. Boy, is this tape boring. The PM section is much better than the AM, but I still say unless what you are looking for is meditation only..stay away from this video. I am heading for more power yoga instead."
3,For Beginners Only,"You'll probably find that this video will become too easy very quickly...it is definately for beginners only. In particular, I find the AM Yoga segment with Rodney Yee as a glorified morning stretch. It is very nicely shot on the beach, which is great to wake up to, but I think there is better value out there. I'm already having to purchase a more advanced yoga video even though I've only had this for 2 months (I graduated this video within 3 weeks, and I'm not a super star athlete). Good luck and I hope this helps."
5,A very good way to wake up and go to bed,"I really liked both tapes. I don't have time to do more than 40 minutes exercises a day and doing 20 in the morning and 20 at night is a very good option. I also have the Living Yoga - Back Care Yoga for Beginners which is helping me a lot to improve the posture and relief the pain. The tape is very well done, the landscape is relaxing and also the sound."
1,Buyer Beware - this is a major lemon!,"If you are a beginner, these tapes teach you nothing. A chunk of the beginning is devoted to trying to get you to buy some yoga journal (which is where, you are finally informed, you can actually find instructions for the poses included on the tapes). Unless you enjoy paying for what is essentially an advertisement, don't waste your money on this."
4,Good way to start the day,"I am a beginner but I thorougly enjoy both tapes. An excellent way to start the day and also to wind down after a busy day. The excersises for the AM yoga are simple enough. The PM excersises are much more demanding but good, also because flexibility increases already after a week. It's not a very extensive introduction toyoga, but I'm very happy I bought it."
2,Not for people who want to shape up,"I've done yoga tapes where the emphasis is on toning up while you find...peace...but this really isn't, especially the A.M. tape. I think if you want to tone up, try a different tape, but if you just want to be a calmer person, then go with this one."
2,"Its, Ok",in this VHS mike queries the most notable professionals of that time on their strengths in the game such as 'how to break 9-ball'.I did not gain much instruction from this. Video quality was poor as it is also VHS. Price did not balance with instruction gained. Mike sigel has a newer version of DVD available.
5,Super CD,"People, get this into ya! These guys have got what it takes to blitz the music world and they are going to No.1. Definite buy, so put it on your Christmas lists."
1,Inefficient Design/No customer service,"Filter fits loosely as dimensions are not as specified. Even worse, customer service is non-existent. No response to phone calls or emails. Unable to ship as indicated. A company to avoid at all costs."
5,best down home writing in this book!,"This is my very favorite book. I can re-read it joyfully. It makes me smile, laugh and cry and be humbled and grateful. As I read it it is as though Pastor Ron is standing there speaking directly to me. I love this book and Pastor Ron Mehl as well. :)"
3,"Cleans great, but not for 'sensitive' skin","I tried this after buying a front-load washer. Persil ""Sensitive"" MegaPerls does the best job of cleaning laundry I have ever seen.BUT, this detergent is scented, and the scent lingers, and stronger on some fabrics.It gave my husband a rash and I was mildly itchy from it.If it had no perfume at all, it would be perfect. If you have allergies and/or are sensitive to scent, try at your own risk."
3,OK. Not great.,"First of all, a qualifier. I bought this book for my son who is showing an interest in cooking and is 11. So this review is not mine even thought I've checked that the review is written by someone older that 13. Ben's first step was to look through the book and mark recipes that looked good -- there were at least 20. However, the organization confused him. Rachel Ray tends to be a little too cutesy for his age group and he didn't think that all the recipes he selected were easy enough for him even though he stuck to the selections that were meant for him. He has made a few, some were OK some were not. Some were just plain weird."
2,soso,I love rachael ray but these recipes are not for kids. They are not easy and the ingredients arent kid friendly.
2,"Recipes Look Good, But They're Not","I've tried two of the recipes in the book, and they're not too good. The Middle Eastern Rice Bowl has a lot of chicken (I don't really like chicken.). The Thai Rice Bowl had a weird flavor to it. There are so many recipes that look good in there, like the Fuji Apples and Peanut Buttery Caramel Dip, but now that my mom says that the recipes are ""off"", I don't think they will taste that good. Remember, this is a kid's opinion, so you might not agree."
4,Great Purchase!,My 8 and 5 year old want to cook dinner every night. They are easy and DELICIOUS!!!! It makes dinner so much fun and my children have actually eaten vegetables!
2,Not for my kids...,"I don't think Rachael Ray has kids and it shows - alot of these recipes are for things most kids won't eat OR things that are not very good for them, lots of fat, sugar, processed food etc. The book is cute-looking but has not been very useful in cooking with my kids. There are other better kids cookbooks out there or even cookbooks for adults with easier, healthier recipes. Also - no pictures of the food, just Rachael and kids - my kids really like to see what a dish will look like - it makes them want to cook the recipe."
5,The Perfect Book By Diego,"I really like this book because it tells about a girl that wants a pet but her parents won't let her. Her parents gave her a cactus but she didnt like it and it wasnt a pet. Then she asked her parents almost all the animals and their parents said ""NO"". If you want to know more about this book read "" THE PERFECT PET""."
1,Disappointing!,"I wish I had trusted the first reviewer rather than the second. I've read most of the Uncle John's books, and enjoy them. This is by far my least favorite. The writing is mostly fluff, not succinct like other Uncle John's books. The writer tries to be humorous, but in my opinion fails. Let the story provide the humor. Articles end three quarters down the page or near the top of the next page, then another starts on the following page. This gives the impression that they're padding the book to make it longer/thicker. If this had been my first Uncle John book I doubt I would have bought so many others. Thankfully the others are so much better! Think twice about buying this book. Perhaps review it at a local bookstore first."
5,Great,"Great CD and Great Service, Great Price. My order actually arrived a day earlier than expected. Thanks Again for the GREAT service."
5,Incredible album,"If you are a fan of alternative rock, you will love this cd. The music is something that stirs emotion in each song. I have listened to this cd many times since I purchased it and have recommended it to many friends so far that had to run out and get it for themselves. Already Over is an amazing song and Pieces is touching in a way that is not overly sappy, but still plucks at your heartstrings. Breathe into Me has meaningful lyrics molded into a catchy tune, you can't help but get into it. Unlike some bands that do more screaming than singing these guys have the voices to accompany the crashing guitar riffs. However, for you screamers out there...there is enough of that too. :)"
1,Ultra Right-Wing Vitriolic Rant Against Animal Rights,"If you like Rush Limbaugh, you will love this book. It is reallynothing but right-wing political diatribe. LIke most diatribe itis filled with half-baked truths, misleading facts, and speciousmisrepresentations. The book is blatantly one-sided. He hashas nothing but contempt for people who support animal rights.He claims that people who believe in animal rights are dupes ofanimal rights propoganda promoted by animal rights conspirators.This work is his personal anti animal-rights manifesto. Its styleis reminiscent of those who claim the holocaust never happenedand that the holocaust is nothing but a Jewish conspiracy. Ifyou are looking for an objective, balanced presentation, youare not going to find it here. What you do find is vitriolic,vituperative, venomous invective."
4,Almost as good as the original,"I'll admit, I lost my original stylus while moving my home, so I had to buy a replacement.Pro: This new stylus works just as well, with the added bonus of having a built in ink-pen - that's fantastic.Con: The only negative (and it's only a slight negative), is that the telescoping top doesn't work quite as well as the original. Don't get me wrong, it does telescope and feels great when in the 'long position'. But while in the 'holder', sometimes it doesn't pop-out on the first push. It's more of a slight annoyance than a problem."
4,"Great product, but could be cheaper to be perfect.","I lost my stylus for my Palm LifeDrive. Other styli did not fit right and I thought the Palm website was too expensive. This purchase came in a pack of three (good in case I misplace my stylus again). It was still a little pricey at around $30 for three. However, it fits perfectly and has the spring loaded top like the original so that the stylus is completely concealed in the PDA stylus slot, but can be easily accessed when the top of the stylus releases with a push and springs up. The body is metal and feels rugged. The push button top and tip are hard plastic. The tip has a small nipple on the end that fits into the reset button for a soft reset. Overall, I am pleased with the product and can't see much difference between it and original equipment."
1,doesn't fit all cribs like it says,"I have a new style square crib that doesn't have a front that lets down, and it doesn't fit on it anywhere!! I had to waste $4 to mail it back to get a refund !!"
2,KH has come a long away,"As a big fan of KH Bishop Trilogies, I was curious to read some of her earlier work. The only thing I can say is, that it's a good thing this book wasn't my first experience with the author or I would have avoided her afterwards.The three plots were directed by women with ""irrational fears or terrors"" and besotted head-strong men who are determined to win over the swooning maidens. The ""witty dialogue"" could very well put you in a sugar coma.So buyer beware, this is no Bishop trilogy or even an Amanda, or a Finding Laura (which aren't as good as the Bishop Books but show HUGE improvements in plot development). This is the publisher trying to make money off the author's recent success by republishing stories that were probably valiant efforts in the past but just don't make the grade today.If nothing else, if you insist on reading it, it will give you an idea on how hard KH has worked to improve her craft. Which I truly appreciate! :)"
5,In a word...Excellent,"This is without a doubt THE book on EC.I found it to be a REAL page turner, and was assembled in a brilliant way - especially the opening chapter.I honestly think Elvis himself would agree that it was done with accuracy, sensitivity and fairness. It's insightful, intelligent, and extremely interesting. A great bonus to go along with the fine research done are many never before seen, very interesting photos.Great Job Graeme!!!! You did the man proud!!"
2,Not much on the man,"After reading this book I felt I had even less understanding of EC than when I started.There's a lot of factual information about songs, tours and setlists, but if you want to get a grip on what made and makes Elvis tick, you won't get it here."
3,Declining Quality,"In 2007, I would have written the same review as most of the people on here. My Swiss Mountain dog loves catching this frisbee, and she is rough on them, so the Kong was a no-brainer. I used to leave this out in the yard, and it would last for almost a year, even through tug-of-war matches with her lab buddy Sam.Unfortunately, the quality has seriously declined in the last year (while the price has gone up). I keep the frisbee in a closet when I'm not tossing it to Lucy so she can't tear it, and nonetheless, the last two I've bought have fallen apart in less than 3 months. As soon as it gets wet, just from dewy grass, it starts to break. The rubber starts to disintegrate in the thinner parts and the center ends up falling out. Considering they went from 9 dollars to 14 dollars at Petsmart in the last two years, one every two months is just too expensive!"
3,Better than most frisbees,"My dog usually tears the cheap plastic frisbees apart in five minutes, but this lasted about a month. So, it's definately not indestructible, but it lasts longer than most frisbees."
2,Not as tough as expected.,"I've purchased other red Kong toys for my 80lb lab, and he has never been able to destroy them. So I had high hopes for the Frisbee (rubber flyer), but unfortunately it was not as durable as the tennis-style ball or the stuff-able classic kong. He tore the edge off of the flyer on the first day. I'd recommend getting the flyer in the black (which is more durable, meant for heavy chewers) if they make such a thing, even if your dog is normally fine with the red kongs."
3,okay,The product is perfect. Exactly what I wanted. But I learned my dog doesn't want to run with a round object. She likes sticks!
1,ZERO rating not possible?,"This toy was purchased for me as a Christmas gift. It only lasted about 3 minutes. I havelabs, not pitbulls. It should have done better with a KONG name. Was this a knock off?Because my friends sure got ripped off. I would have given it a ZERO rating if to warn others."
3,Kong Rubber Flyer,"Just okay. A little too heavy to throw far. Hard for lab to pick up. He enjoyed it more as a chew toy than a frisbee type toy. Chewed the edge off, and had to pitch it."
2,No good,"The Kong has been durable, but only because you simply can't throw this heavy thing so it never gets play-time. With some shoulder-wrenching practice, you could probably throw it a good 20 feet. I have superdog power-chewers, and they haven't made the slightest dent in this one... but on the other hand, maybe that's just because they could not care less about this stupid brick.UPDATE: Our younger dog grew into an adult who chews up everything, including this, apparently ingesting about a quarter of it. So: not durable, nor safe with power-chewers."
5,A Dog Trainer's perspective,"As a dog trainer and also having a large German Shepherd I LOVE LOVE LOVE all Kong toys, have several and recommend them to my clients. They are amazing and great for tough chewers! They will outlast almost everything so they are worth every penny."
3,Not what I expected from KONG,"I received this rubber flyer today...my 1 year old black lab/mix was very excited about it! But, he mostly just wanted to chew it. Unfortunately my husband left him alone with it for about 2 minutes, and he tore the edge in one place. Hopefully it will still fly (after we performed a little surgery on it)...but I expected it to last a lot longer than a few minutes."
3,Great Deal,"I have bought 4 of these at the local pet store. My dog is very tough on frisbees but loves them. The orka frisbee is more durable but this is red so it is easier for my dog to see in all environments. This frisbee does not float so be careful around water. Also the plastic around the edge is easily broken and then the frisbee doesn't fly straight. There are some flaws to this toy, but I still like it and continue to buy them. For the amazon price it can't be beat!I recently bought the top paw frisbee and so far my dog has not ben able to destroy it. If your dog is like mine and is very tough on toys I have found the top paw brand to be the best!"
2,trust your instinct,"ought this specifically from reviews i read... in fact, it was a buyer who also had german shepards... at any rate, my dogs, 1 1/2 year old and 5 mos. have had this for 2 weeks and have already destroyed the edges. they will continue until its a small chewable disc... my next purchase will be the hyperflyte which, apparently is 10 times tougher than this model... if that doesn't work then i will just go to original plan which is to use frisbee golf disc drivers... good luck everyone"
3,Not as strong as advertised?,"Ok, my lab is rough with his toys. But that's why I got this ""indestructable"" frisbee. Well he ripped it to shreds. If you have a dog who does this as well, I guess we have to get the black one which is the strongest."
1,Eaten in two secs,"Dog ate this in two seconds. Like, ripped to pieces. He is a 50 lb border collie... Can't even imagine what a Labrador could do to it."
2,Not worth it,"Although it's Kong brand, the rubber is thinner than regular Kong toys and therefore not as durable. My golden retrievers tore through three of them in two days. They were fun while they lasted... But I'm still unsuccessful in the search for an indestructible frisbee."
4,"Not perfect, but better than any other dog frisbees","I'm getting close to saying I've tried them all -- my dog has shredded just about every frisbee I've bought for her. The Kong Flyer at least lasted several weeks before the punctures and tears overcame its aerodynamics. If you find anything better, let me know."
2,Killed in 15 minutes,"My 60 pound lab loved the toy. The first time I tossed it around for her she tore it and started eating the pieces. If your dog enjoys chewing everything like my lab, then don't get this."
2,I hope it still flies,"A present for Jasper (a 60lb black lab) under the tree. As usual, he gets to hunt out and open his own.. He does so with the Kong Flyer.. I proceed to open a gift for myself. Before completing my own unwrapping, he has removed the gift wrap and taken a big chunk out of the Kong.. I've had regular Kongs around for years and never seen one destroyed within minutes. Needless to say, I think the stamina of this particular toy has something left to be desired. Back to the tennis balls.. at least they don't cost $9 a pop!"
3,"Great Fun, But...","The Kong Rubber Flyer is a great short distance, floating dog frisbee. Lots of fun for fetching, and easy for my dog to catch and pick up from the ground. My black lab lives to retrieve and (while it lasted) he loved this frisbee. It quickly became his favorite toy. Unfortunately, he changed it into his favorite ""toys"" in a matter of days. Fun for short distance, backyard usage...just don't leave it outside with your dog if s/he has any chewing power at all. My dog totally destroyed it in no time. I'm debating whether to get another Kong Rubber Flyer or something more durable that doesn't have to go inside covered with dog slobber. LOL!"
1,Doesn't fly well,"It's a simple principle of aerodynamics. The weight-to-mass ratio of this disc is higher than most other frisbees. In other words, it's very heavy and tends to drop/descend rapidly. This makes tricks and such more difficult with the Kong. I was looking for a soft disc that would be safer for my dog's teeth than the standard frisbees; I much prefer and recommend the Soft-Bite Floppy discs by Aspen Pet Products. Note on Chewing/Durability: Neither the Kong nor the Soft-Bite nor any frisbee is intended as a chew toy. Dogs should be monitored while using these, and ideally, trained to not chew/maintain a soft bite on the disc (as I've done with my dog). They should not be left alone with either or any disc."
4,WHEEEE!,"This is my second KONG frisbee, (lost the first over a fence.) And my dog and I can't get enough of this thing. It's a little softer then the normal Kong rubber, but just as strong. My only suggestion is not to leave it out in the sun, it will get a little whiter, and softer. But it works just as well. If you like to throw a frisbee around, GET THIS!"
2,Didn't last very long,"My blue heeler had torn through the thin center portion of this toy within the first day we had it. It didn't last any longer than the cheap $1 frisbees we'd been buying previously. You will still have to monitor your dog closely when he's playing this toy to stop him from ripping through it.I ended up going back to the cheap $1 frisbees. At least with those, I'm not out $10 if I turn my back for a few minutes and he chews it up.I'm a huge fan of Kong's normal dog toys and was expecting a similar experience with this frisbee toy. Unfortunately, if you're expecting this to be nigh-invulnerable like their regular dog toys, you will be disappointed."
4,Battle tested by stella,"I have a 3 year old german shepherd boxer mix. She loves nothing more than playing frisbee. We have tried every single brand we can find. Including the black version of the kong frisbee for aggressive chewers(which stella promptly ripped in half, and it didnt fly well at all). Have also tried the doggone disc/waterbowl(didnt fly well) which claims to be indestuctable. Stella proved them wrong. She tends to chomp down hard on her frisbee when she brings it back. NO other frisbee on the market can withstand stella's bite. Eventually she does destroy her disc, but they last about a month. Tried Orka's blue rubber frisbee. also durable but doesnt fly nearly as good as this one.These discs are about 13 bucks at my local pet store. I stock up on amazon and get them for around 5 or 6. =] I can make this disc fly across a football field."
3,it is insane to ask for such a price on anything..I like the artist but who can afford that much?,"I would buy the music but not for that much,, This is too expensive I could get a new Ipad for this much money..If they would come down alot in price I would consider buying this for sure because I like the artist.."
3,Funny as all get out,"i have a lazy cat - you know, one that talks back and eats Lasagna? Anyway, at her age and weight 7 and 9 respectively, she doesn't like to play much.But this ""Hartz Birds of a feather"" she absolutely adores. The problem is that the internal guts first one just plain wore out in a week, and the lanyard/mast of the second one broke the first day! That was Two in one week! And who saves a resaeipt for a cat toy?All Hartz has to do is beef up the guts a bit and use a more flecible mast and this thing is an absolute winner!!Buy at your own risk. Your cat'll love it - til it breaks. They are hard to find in my area, but one of these days I'm gonna try ONE more! My cat has a blast just watching it spin!"
4,Not sure it works as it should but my cat loves it!,"Length:: 0:54 MinsI just adopted two 10-month old kittens from a local shelter. I picked up this product at a local grocery store to see if they would like it. Milo (pictured in video) feel in love with it. It doesn't really move on its own but when Milo swats at it, it does swing around a bit. I started it off on my kitchen floor so it would move easier but the first time Milo caught it in his mouth he ran into the living room with it. In the video you can see him hiss at his brother who tried to venture over to it. Milo loves it and won't share. The only drawback for me is that within the first hour of play one of the feathers came off and by this morning the toy was down to one. I got mine for 3.33 so I think I'll run out and pick up a spare. It gets my vote because Milo loves it and will play with it for hours at a time."
5,"So far, so good!","My son picked this out as a birthday gift for his dad. We've only used it once, but it worked out great - we roasted marshmallows and made smores at the end of his birthday party."
5,Love it!!!!,This is a fantastic fire pit! I just received it a little over a week ago and use it 3 times already and it works great! The stainless steel is very durable and looks great! Easy to clean... my nephew loves roasting marshmallows with it! just an all around great product!
3,"Steel bowl came with lots of ""little dimple dents"", Top lid had gaps in the mesh","This would be a great fire bowl design, if the quality we're present.The cast iron leds and support are stoudt, but have minor alignment issues. Also, my new steel bowl, nice and shiny, has roughly 20 penil eraser deep size dents, WTF!?Send me a replacement steel bowl! Also, nice top cover deisgn, but it should fit into a nicer ""groove matching a lip"" in later revisions.Also, quality or shipping damages issues with the top of the mesh dome cover, with texas hailstore 1""-2"" size golf ball dents in the mesh? Again, good design but WTF.Please replace items or I'll share lots of photos with the Amazon Primers on here."
4,New features for sql server 2005 but not pro,This books seems to be a list and quick summary of new features of sql server 2005. I like the fact that the authors do make an attempt to explain why the new features are present and how to use them. However I would not call it a professional book since it does not dive into depth in any one particular feature on how to take advantage of these features and how to implement something like it in a production environment. All we have is short demo samples which is good for explaining but not really helping the dba/developer integerate it with their existing systems and applications as seen in more advanced/architecture books.I fell asleep a few times whilst going thru this book. It could do with alot more pictures too to keep the motivation goingA very good intro to sql server 2005 but you still going to need to buy a book for each topic/chapter on this book to be competent user since there simply isn't enough information/examples in it
4,This Game is the BEST!(...),"This game is the best. It is better than the PC, Gameboy and Gamecube versions, because face it the Playstation 2 is the best. It has PRO players like Ichiro, Alfonso Soriano, Alex Rodriguez, Sammy Sosa, Nomar Garciaparra, Carlos Delgado, Barry Bonds, Dontrelle Willis and you can unlock people like Mike Piazza, Derek Jeter, Randy Johnson and Pedro Martinez. This game is the best and it does not matter if your 5 or 30, if you like baseball, BUY THIS GAME!(...)"
1,ARE YOU SERIOUS,"i was a big fan of the CPU games, i have them love them, but the game is horrible! The pitching takes days to get to the plate and the pithcing is horrible, even the controles are more difficult than MVP BASEBALL 2004!"
1,A Completely Misleading Title,"I am a degreed electrical engineer with 7 years of experience in the electric motor industry. Even I couldn't understand this book. Extensive portions of the book state equations using calculus. There is little explaination of the equations. The book appears to be a collection of advanced technical papers previously written for IEEE academic symposiums. Unless you are very comfortable with calculus and already know how to design electric motors, this book will be unintelligable. This collection of advanced academic papers demonstrates the authors command of the discipline and got him published. It was not written to educate the reader. A collection of academic papers does not constitute a handbook. I have a more than mild suspicion the five star review by an earlier ""reader"" may be a ringer."
1,It was just ok...,it was with absolute excitement that I embarked on reading the book. It was not what I thought. It was just okay.
2,"2 or 3 good songs, the rest is garbage","if you must own this CD, buy it used at the cheapest possible price. I spent $6.98 on it and I paid too much. Most of these songs are utter garbage throwaway tracks"
5,Best on the market!!!,"I had one like this that lasted for over six years. I use it all the time because I don't put any of my clothes in a dryer. Well, it finally bit the dust. I went back to Bed, Bath and Beyond in the hopes of getting another one but they didn't have the same style. After trying 3 other types of drying racks, I finally found this one--just like my old one--and am happy as a clam. It holds quite a bit. I usually have 2 loads of clothes--8 jeans, 10 shirts, etc.--and it holds it all. If you're looking for a clothing rack, you've found the best one!"
1,Total misrepresentation,"This is your standard unfinished pine and white, plastic dowel rod drying rack. The sketch is a total misrepresentation that looks as if the rack is a dark color. It, in fact, is the same one you can purchase at any Walmart or Menards for half the price. The seller will not stand behind his product and refuses to send a return postage label so that I can return it. This is the only bad experience I have ever had with an online purchase. Horrible!"
1,I returned this rack,This was not the quality I expected. Very flimsy. One arrived broken. I returned them all. I was very disappointed.
3,"Only great for ""new learners.""","If you are already an expert, dying to learn new deep detailed facts, you could propbably write this book. I recomend this book to anyone who doesn't know a clue about horses! It has the basic info."
5,Christmas!,I did not know that this series had a Christmas episode. It was actually pretty awesome. I was amazed that they would even attempt to ride their bikes during the winter.
2,Just Tidbits of Information but Some Nice Pictures,This book does not provide details on any of the psychic phenomena. But one thing good about it is the artwork and colorful photos.This is a book for flipping through and leisurely read in the library. Can finish reading in less than an hour. Not worth buying; just read it in the library will be enough.
1,"""Here's Johnny""?","This is not at all what we thought it would be. It sounds like a poorly mixed, Johnny wanna be. Save your $$."
1,Jump starter,"Worked half way once, then would'nt work at all. Cost of product not worth the hassle of returning so I tossed it in the garbage."
1,"The start of the awful trilogy, time to hire a new band Ed","The terribly named Floor is too far away sounds as bad as it is named. A poor effort to what were one of the best bands out there. The reason, Ed the guitarist is working with a line up who is a shadow of the band they used to be. I can't understand how sycophantic fans can give this album any more than 2 stars? Don't you remember when Ed used to surround himself with people who can actually PLAY! Getting his wife to join the band was the worst possible thing. All very tragic.I hope Ed does look for a new line up as he still has it, the others sadly not."
5,Fun book,"I bought this comic issue by issue in the mid seventies from grocery store comic book stands. I missed a bunch of issues and when I saw this, I was able to read it and be a kid again."
4,Good Buy for Palm Sander,Purchased this sander to complete vanity refinishing project. Sander performed well and look forward to using it on future woodworking projects.
4,Informative,"THe video was informative and did teach me something, so it was worth my money. On the other hand, I did not enjoy watching a recap of the lesson in short; could have rewound the dvd if I wanted to do that!"
2,Skins for Wii poor quality,Have written to have this item replace and no luck poor quality they ripped on first use.Still in the original box and not being used.Can you replace them for me did contact some time ago never heard anything backThank youEllen
2,Be carefule with these,"They cover the controllers, but be careful putting them on. They tear very easily."
3,Wii Skins...increase the fun,These skins are perfect for adding the to the fun of playing Wii...no chance of grabbing the wrong remote. Excellant quality and durability.
4,Functional glove for your wii-mote,"If you have more than one Wii-mote, and have different Mii's saved on them, you probably need a way to tell them apart. Wii-motes come with a nice skin to protect them, and give them a better grip but they're all made of the same clear material. I purchased this skin (in blue) to help me tell my two Wii-motes apart and I have not regretted the decision to do so. These skins are thinner than the ones which come standard with the Wii, but I became accustomed to it very quickly. It's nubbed on the back to increase grip-ability and comes with an additional skin for the nunchuck. It also comes with a color-coded wrist strap, which does not lock into place. Overall, it's a solid product. It is tough to remove when replacing batteries, but it is sturdy enough to not rip when doing so. I was hoping that these skins would be thin enough to allow them to be used with the Wii Zapper, but they are not."
4,It works and It's pink,"My Girlfriend and I got the wii because we both enjoyed playing. But recently she has wanted to play more because her controllers are pink. I don't care for it, but she thinks there cute, so we're both happy"
3,Helpful original data,"This text was not what I expected. Only the brief introduction is a narrative, while the text itself is a collection of the transcriptions from seminars, articles about O'Connor's life, and her answers to questions at various symposia. That is not to suggest that the book was not useful; instead, I gained valuable data that would have otherwise taken me hours to find in a library - all between the covers of this short book. (Some readers may be interested to know that some of the interviews may be recognized as those mocked by O'Connor in her letters in The Habit of Being.) It is interesting to observe her behavior as she participates in a panel discussion, and her responses are classic O'Connor.I would recommend this book to those looking for data sources for research and those hoping for unfiltered insight into the person of Flannery O'Connor."
2,Don't bother with the replacement brushes,"I love most oxo products. I can't really recommend this brush. After using it for a couple of months the part where you add the soap developed a leak. Also, it is difficult to fill it with soap because the top is difficult to remove. The scrubber brush is pretty nice and I am still using the brush because I bought the replacement brushes. I am not having the best luck with this brush. Sorry OXO I usually love your products like my sink strainer, apple cutter and vege peeler, etc.January 8, 2009I just wanted to add: That I could not find another dish brush like this one that is any better and I have tried many. I had 2 refill brush heads left so I decided to get another one of these so I could use them up. I have found this time that the brush is lasting much better. Also, the top is still difficult to remove, however if you open it while it is dry that helps."
3,Can't live with out this,this item matches our stainless kitchen very well. this lil guy gets used daily. the only thing I have against it is that the rubber cap on the top will wear out from use and you end up with it now squirting because the crack in the top creates a air leak. so what we have done is buy the cheapo white ones and use the rubber cap from it on our stainless unit.
4,Live they Thrive,"I saw Strays Don't Sleep when they opened for Josh Rouse in NYC. Fell in love with the bands intensity and joy. I picked up this cd, and found it inconsistent but worth owning. There are a couple of standout tracks - Night is Still, Martin Luther Ave., For You Blue Skies, and Falling Asleep With You that caught my attention on the first go round. After a few listens, I found that the song Cars & History had gotten stuck in my brain, and stayed there for weeks. I truly enjoy this album and this band.Their sound is a mix of folk rock alternative. Sometimes upbeat and rocking, others soft and crooning. Check it out."
4,JUNKMAN'S ITCH!!,"I have the complete collection now. Season 6 was the end of the road, that's why i only gave it a 4 star. Still worth every penny if you are a true fan like i am. Buy it now, and if you don't have the other seasons i would suggest you don't wait any longer and get them. A must have collection!!!!!!!!!"
5,Many memorable episodes in season 6...,"Although (as other reviewers have noted) the show started to decline after season three, season six provided some wonderful laughs. My personal favorite is the episode with Riley King (B.B. King's real name). He performs his standard ""How Blue Can You Get"" and the episode is hysterical. Redd Foxx was a classic comedian and Demond Wilson was a perfect straight man. Add all of the other memorable charcters to the mix (Bubba Bexley, Grady Wilson, Aunt Ester et al) and few will argue that ""Sanford and Son"" was a great comedy."
3,S&S 6th Season - End of The Line,"By the time Sanford and Son returned for it's sixth season in 1976,not only has issue oriented sitcoms(All In The Family,Good Times) lost their foothold in the Nielsons and replaced by more family friendly shows (Happy Days,Laverne & Shirley,What's Happening!),but the show's quality had erode to the point that it's audience had tuned elsewhere.After four high rated seasons,S&S; sucumb to poor writing, gratuitous guest stars(like celebraties would visit a junkyard), and cheap ratings catching gimmicks (the Hawaii episode and the Redd foxx lookalike contest).At the end of the 6th season,the two stars quit,and the next season the show was retooled as The Sanford Arms featuring Teddy Wilson along with the supporting cast.The show only lasted few episodes before it was officially cancelled.In 1980,Sanford premiered sans Demond Wilson.Lacking the chemestry of the previous show,it was cancelled after a year a half later."
4,Sanford And Son Still Pleases,"This is the final season of the show that you'll enjoy from the first episode to the last. Travel with Fred and Lamont to Hawaii their adventure nearly gets them killed. The first episode that has Fred And Lamont going to Hawaii is 50 minutes long, it's actually part of a three part episode. Aunt Esther and Woodrow adopt a troubled youth. Fred meets Redd Foxx, when Fred enters a Redd Foxx look alike contest. Lamont gives Fred a ticket to see B.B. King for Father's Day, Fred thinks B.B. wants to do him in for stealing Elizabeth from him. There's many more memorable episodes, the last episode is a fitting end to the series. Although this season isn't quite as strong as the previous season, it's still worth buying."
4,End of a good thing,"The sixth season of sanford and son was the last of my favorite sitcom of all-time. But, honestly, this was also the worst season of them all, only one episode is truly good. The show had ran its course by this point. This dvd set is good to complete a collection if you are die hard fan like myself. But, if you are a casual fan, I wouldn't recommend this set, stick to some of the earlier shows."
2,Not good enough.,"The biggest problem with this is that there is no hole for the Wiimote's strap to come out of the bottom - so you have to remove it to put the Wiimote into this wheel. If you don't - and try to force the Wiimote into it, you'll likely rub off some of the rubber padding on the inside of the Wiimote slot.Also it's not very comfortable - at least of my hands. It seems like they made it upside down - like the open end should be the bottom, since that's where your hands really are so you can use the buttons on the Wiimote.Overall, it's OK... but just that: ""OK."" I'd keep shopping if I were you."
3,Nice looking,"I bought this as a second steering wheel for some Mario Kart fun. It looks good and works well with one minor flaw, and that is that the Wiimote must be pulled out of the wheel to navigate the menus. It does not have the small window that the Official Nintend wheel has. If you just use it for the second controller, though, then it is not an inconvenience."
1,False Advertising!!,"If you'll notice on the picture options, one is of a blue and white racing wheel without the stand, and the other is of what appears to be a one-piece white racing wheel attached to stand. The two pictures are of TWO TOTALLY DIFFERENT PRODUCTS. I did not click to enlarge the second blue wheel pic when I bought this, so I thought both ad a stand attached. So what I was expecting is NOT what I received. I thought about not bothering with the return process, because it was only $8.00, but then I thought, this is false advertising, and it was the principle of the thing, and I should not have to pay for something that was not AT ALL what I wanted. The white stand pic is the one that is first shown to customers and I can't help but think it is on purpose. Shame on Amazon for letting this happen. They should've been more diligent. I hope this review helps others to realize the lie they are telling. If I could, I would give this a 0 star rating."
3,Not my cup of tea,I first need to confess that I only read about 20% of the book before I stopped. It is possible that the book significantly improved as the story progressed. I know very little about Andrew Jackson and I was hoping to learn some history in an entertaining fashion through the use of a historical novel. In the portion of the novel that I read almost every character seemed to have a similar almost interchangeable cynical and sarcastic manner. I did not find the novelistic elements particularly compelling and I did not feel that I was learning much history. Therefore I aborted the novel and ordered a straight biography of Andrew Jackson.
1,Expensive and unclear,"This book is sucha collasal waste of money. The ideas presented are very basic, but the authors are rather daft and manage to confuse readers even on simple concepts. Much of the stuff any normal person with average IQ would be able to understand reading investopedia. The book is a typical MBA book - dumbed down, glossy and expensive."
5,Maier as an author,The only thing disappointing with Maier is he doesn't write enough.- finish a book and you crave for another.
1,SWAT Workout,"Big scam, item order description and DVD cover state that it include Resistance Band that you won't find it anywhere, beaware!!!!!!!"
3,Good Band Workout,"I like working the the handled tubing; this product comes with a band, not tubing like they use in the workout but if you don't have the tubing this will do. Typical exercises: curls, squats, overhead presses, push-ups. It is an okay workout. I have a couple other SWAT workouts and use them as an alternate to my regular routine of Forza."
1,Exercise,This product came to me twice without the resistance band and I was trying not to open tne sealed CD until I got the Band but as I said no band came with it.
4,Sound introduction to Postgres,"There are some production problems with the book. But overall it's a fine introduction to Postgres. This isn't a general introduction as the title seems to imply. This text, graphics, and examples, all clearly relate to Postgres.The book is fairly code heavy. With example of the use of Postgres in all of the popular languages. And a hefty amount of SQL examples to learn from and use.A solid introductory walkthrough for anyone new to, or just starting to use Postgres."
3,Not Pleased,The book I received had yellow highlighting from the previous user. This should have been stated so that the consumer could be aware.
1,Care of the Soul: An Example of Touchy-Feely,"I thought this was one of the most stupid books I have read. The author uses buzz words, but is never clear about what he is writing about. It was one of the selections for my local book club, and there was universal agreement that if possible we would give it zero stars."
4,SE102 heart Rate Monitor,Throw away the directions when you get this unit as they are very poor and misleading. Go to the Oregon Scientific website and download the SE102 manual. Here is the link as of today... [...] Biggest problem was getting conductivity of the sensor belt. I bought the recommended conductive gel from Amazon and once I downloaded the manual was able to figure out where to apply the gel. After this the product worked extremely well especially for the price I paid off Amazon. Could never get the touch face part to work and got no help from Oregon but to tell you the truth I wasn't interested in using it anyway. If not for those two issues and no support I would have definitely rated this product five star.
3,Basic but functional,"Even with gel, I have lots of trouble getting the sensor to pick up my heart rate until it reaches 120bpm. Once it starts working though it has never lost during an workout.I haven't used any of the other features of the watch, I just use it to display my heart rate."
1,Broke down in 34 days,"At first it looked great, everything seemed ok. But then I began to get readings higher than normal. And yesterday (may 11), just 34 days after I bought it, while I was in a long run it went crazy, everything turn on in the display.Now I'm trying to make my guarantee work."
4,It's good,"I like this heart rate monitor. It's not a bulky sized watch but has a big enough screen to see all the features. The chest strap is not uncomfortable and I can hardly tell it's there once I'm going. As far as knowing your calorie burn, if you enter your weight, height, age and have the heart rate monitor watching your heart rate, it WILL give you an accurate reading. You just need to make sure you set all of those functions. I do plan to test it along with the treadmill at the gym to see if there is a difference but I have tested the heart rate on this watch and a previously used one I have and they are dead on each other and the other does not have a chest strap. I think it is well worth the money!"
4,I went to broome,"Although I live in Australia,I've never been to Broome,until I read tears of the moon. It's a great big story about great strong women and a few pirates and you will love it."
5,Love it another great aussy family saga,I love all Di's books but this along with Barra Creek is a favorite. The love story is exactly as every women dreams of in that of finding her true soul mate but of course love never runs smoothly & this is a love that was worth fighting for. I was glued even though this is actually my second time reading this noval. I read it again before starting the sequel & there is very few books I get through the whole story with no skimming a second time round but this was just as good as the first reading. Can't wait to start on the next book now. Thanks Di for writing such great stories with an authentic Australian flavour.
4,adult book,more of a coffee table type book for the 20 30 something crowd than for kids. I loved it but a younger person would not
4,Great Book But...,It's incomplete. This book only goes up to Transformers Energon and ends there. I was hoping it would stop at the movie line. It is a nice book which I picked up from the library a couple weeks ago. One figure that I liked in the book was the Beast Machines Cycle Drone. Reason being that it reminds me of Revenge of the Fallen Demolisher. But I wish it would stop at the Transformers 2007 film and maybe make a redo. I half recomend it and half don't recomend it.
4,Great Information,I was always a fan of Transformers. This book breaks down the history of the Transformers from before generation 1 to the Armada & Energon generation. The only drawback is that I wish it would show more of the actual toys. It was still great buy and I would recommend to any Transformer fan.
1,"Dated, old thoughts","Not worth your time reading. This is old ideas that are not relevant in the 2000s.Try another book. The ""All About"" series of books in below the information in the ""___blanK____ for Dummies"" books."
5,One Stop Investing Guide,"This book is a very appropriate mix of theory and technical application. There are too many books that focus on one to the exclusion of the other. There were sound principles that every investor should be familiar with (whether or not you agree with them) and there are some very helpful practical advice on implementing the theories.I think Passive, index fund investing is the ONLY way to properly invest. For those seeking more drama, I recommend dedicating no more than 10% of your portfolio to stock picking and timing or just send your money to me. In the end it will be the same result.This book gives a great overview for a very serious approach to investing in Mutual Funds. I refer to it all the time. For the price of the book, I recommend it."
2,Where's the Index?,"At first, I thought maybe it was just me and I was missing something. But then I realized that there is no index in this book! Having to hunt through the Content to find a chicken recipe is a killer. As a fellow writer, I have to wonder why an editor would ever recommend this as a viable option for someone. On a different note, I had the same problem with this book as her other one: I had a tough time finding the recipes that I show for a particular show in the book."
2,You Spin Me Round,"""Cooking 'Round the Clock"" is a concept cookbook as much as the Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band was a concept album--except it worked. On the cover, Food Network diva Rachael Ray looks wired from drinking gallons of coffee in order to cook around the clock. Basically,the concept is to reincarnate the same recipe throughout the day until you're sick of it.""Cooking"" has a confusing layout. Recipes are difficult to find--they're organized by time zone (and I don't mean Central, Pacific or Mountain) The font isn't easy to read. The recipes require much prep work--so they take more than the half hour. There's also the Ray constant of having expensive/obscure ingredients,adding some pretentiousness to the stew.""Cooking 'Round the Clock"" sounds like an interesting concept--for a reality show perhaps--but not so much in the kitchen."
5,Another rebuttal.....,"I also have to challenge the previous reviewer who very obviously has maybe caught only a few episodes of RR's 30 minute meal show. Her recipes are easy and focus on fresh and healthy ingredients. With even a bit more creativity you can ""health"" up her recipes even more if you feel the need to do that. I watch religiously every day and I can reassure you that she doesn't use tortillas and taco shells frequently. It's quite the opposite. I'm amazed by the wide array of flavor combinations that she continually comes up with.My only thing -- you don't really need the book. Tape the show, and download the recipes (which are all available of the website) and make your own book of your favorites.Bottom line -- Great recipes for people who want good healthy food fast."
5,Tossed Salads,"Cinnamon Heart is OBVIOUSLY confused...yes, Rachel Ray's meals always include a tossed salad...but you state that we don't have time to slice, wash etc. and that most make salads with pre-washed / pre-sliced ingredients. That is EXACTLY what RR does! In fact, she said it again yesterday on her show...""pre-packaged, pre-washed lettuce - a 30-mminute meals best friend""...She uses that stuff ALL the time. Plus - I have rarely seen her cook Tex Mex meals. All of RR's recipes are a great combination of fresh and prepared ingredients that make it easy for a working mom to cook a meal...quickly!Re-watch the show Cinnamon Heart! If you want to throw stones at someone - make sure you are throwing stones at the right person!!!"
1,not so fresh anymore,"I have RR's second 30-Minute Meals book and her Get Togethers volume and I watch her show often so I am familiar with her style and her recipes. I enjoy both books very much and most of her shows, preferring the earlier seasons to her later, over-the-top perkiness. That being said, I found this book a big disappointment. First, I must agree with a previous reviewer: the font is *very* hard on the eyes and the color of the type is almost unreadable. Second, the recipes seem like rehashes of what she's done over and over again already. The entire collection seemed very formulaic to me and I actually had no desire to try anything. I think that, as a cook and an author, Ray is treading dangerously into the land of overexposure, churning out books and recipes without the original punch that made her so successful in the first place."
3,Quite diffrent!,"I just finished reading this book and this was my first book by the author.I liked her style of writing, though I found some of her dialouges unintentionally funny. I liked the eroticism in this book, but guess I wanted it to be more detailed. Apart from the first few love scenes, the rest seemed to be terribly rushed and brief.I liked the way in which Marcus's character was developed, though not much detail was given to Mark, because of which I didn't really appreciate the last part of the book.All in all, it was a pretty good read."
3,"Works well, but does not last","I travel alot and use this alot. When it works, it is great, saving space in my briefcase. However, the cord is not well made and i have gone thru 2 cords in 3 years, which does not seem good enough to me."
5,Excellent,"I've already been using the iGo regular wall charger for traveling, but find that this combo kit is even better. I keep it with me in my car and whenever I need it, whether in the car or in my office, its so convenient."
5,A Well-Rounded Offering of Origami,"This was one of the first origami books I purchased, it has a very wide range of designs, with a great section in the beginning outlining the basic folds. The animals are cute, and there's always more difficult ones as you progress! Recommended!"
3,LOVE BRAZILIAN MUSIC,"When I purchased this CD, it didn't show any tracks on it prior to ordering. I grew up with the Fevers, although it was the CD I was looking for but it'll do. I'm Portuguese and love Portuguse/Brazilian music. Also, recomend Roberto Carlos and Carlos Alexandre."
5,mens ring,I bought this ring for my husband and he loved it. I received it when they said I would and it is a great ring
3,"it's good, not great..","the CD has a decent mood to it but a couple of the songs are a bit annoying.. you'll know them when u hear them.. Castaway dreams, under the skin and Down on Rodeo are the only songs i listen to often.. there are a few other songs sprinkled in that work but the other stuff doesn't really grab you.. it's a good CD for having it play in the background as your unwinding or going to sleep but it doesn't move you too much.. it's possible i could grow to like it more if i listened to it more but usually after you hear something 7 or 8 times you'll already know your impression of it and further listening doesn't usu change your feelings on it.. i bought this along with Damien Dempsey's ""Shots"" which ended up being awesome.. i would tell everyone to buy that asap .. it's one of the best CDs i've ever gotten and i'm 31 and have listened to a lot of things over the yrs~~!!"
4,Very Good,"Overall this is a very good CD. Lindsey uses an effect on his voice in every song which I don't think was really necessary and at times his voice will have a weak or wimpy sound to it, but it is well written and the last two songs are great. He plays his classic guitar style which is always great."
3,Still Needs the Mac To Make Magic,"This a very listenable CD with a lot of guitar notes. Lindsey's style keeps getting more complex and he keeps adding notes. This time out, he does a lot of classical guitar style playing. I don't know how he can sing over all of it. It's also a folky type CD with not much going on percussion-wise. I miss the FM rhythm section. --It's strange. Lindsey has loads of talent but he has yet to cut a classic solo CD. All of them have their highlights though. This one has Down on the Rodeo which sounds the most like a FM song. Rest assured, the sound and different effects that he has created for the CD are excellent. I liked all his doctored and watery vocals actually. I wish he would have created some more rockers for the CD. It also has a lot of personal lyrics that seem quirky and self-indulgent at times, but at least we know how he feels."
1,Boring and Awkward,"While the guitars are cool on this album, Buckingham continues to produce his voice in such a way that makes you wish he would just sing with his regular voice without enhancements or echoes etc. This album has no warm sounds, leaving you a little cold."
3,We waited 10 yearsfor NINE new songs??? (two are written by others),"""Sounds like"" OUT OF THE CRADLE is the best that Mr. B will give us. THAT is truly a 5 star experience.LAW AND ORDER is a great ""Tusk"" album and ""Go Insane"" shows the wonderful craziness with Lindsey.And CRADLE? Well, that's a real ""masterpiece.""This? Never really takes off. It's all about the guitar, the ""sound"" but overall, it isn't really much when taken as a whole. And it IS sad that he only releases nine new songs after 10 years--the two remakes my express what he is feeling, but I would like an original Lindsey song.And where are the magnificient guitar solos??? Listen to ""Running Through The Garden"" from the Mac's SAY YOU WILL -- that is the sound of Lindsey endlessly rocking!Two me, 3 stars is ""Just Okay"" and he is capable of so much more."
2,What a mess!!,"After years of waiting I have tried desparetly 5 times now to wade through a mess of cliched childish lyrics performed in a whispered, falsetto voice ran through and endless chain of effects and echo. I have spent the last ten years dreading each announcement of a new Buckingham solo only to have it turn into a Fleetwood Mac reunion and now have a release that cries out for some editorial content from other musicians. All this backed with a K-mart percussion machine??? Why?Like other reviews I will never the less wait patiently for another Buckingham solo album but I will listen firt before I give over my then hard earned social security income."
3,NICE... - BUT NOT Lindsey's Best !!!,"I had to stop, and put on my sunglasses...by viewing all these 5 star reviews before beginning to start typing my review...Don't get me wrong. I just love Lindsey Buckingham and ALL his work (Solo,""Mac"" and Buckingham/Nicks) I have studied his work ! But! In my personal opinion ""Out of the Cradle"" IS his best work - Period ! It just ""Blows"" away ""Under the Skin"" !! I know it's acoustic. I know he's been through alot. But after 14 years...I was expected to be ""Blown"" away with the Rick Turner !!! Not to have my jaw drop after the fifth time of playing it in disbelief...But it's OK ! I'll buy anything Lindsey puts out ! (We ALL will) We love him and his work no matter what we think ! - That's all Warner Brothers and Lindsey wants anyway :-)"
2,Dissapointing for the price,"I was a bit apprehensive about buying a book like this online because you cannot browse the content inside. The photo of the girl on the cover blew me away as well as others.The content inside is abysmal. You will find much better stuff in digital form on the 'net. There are probably a dozen pages of material I don't want to see again. Some of the girls look real and they are captivating, but I am not sure which pictures are actually Naz's and which are not after reading the fine print in the book.The Two stars are for the few good pictures in the book, and I mean good by erotic, sensual, or beautiful."
2,Hormones,Everyone has a different answer and this doctor consults for a supplement company therefore recommending their products only. Would have been better if she would give generic names of what to take and not a specific company but I'm sure she cleans up this way.
4,Greatest Hymns By One of the Greatest voices,Some of the best hymns every written sung by one of the best baritone voices..........Wintley sings his Faith. This man sang at the memorial service of Mr. Chuck Colson..........another great Christian man. Wintley filled the National Cathedral with beauty I will never forget.
5,No Need to Fear,Wintley Phipps has an outstanding voice and this was a very good CDthat I've enjoyed.
2,Achieve happiness through cheating?,"I picked this book because of a nice illustrations, interesting beginning of the story. An old fortune-teller cheated a young carpenter of his money by making him pay for useless advise, like ""you'll be rich when you'll earn a lot of money"", ""you will live long life if you don't die early"" and so on. I expected that the actions of the fortune-teller will be exposed in the story and he will punished.At home I finished the story. To my horror not only the fortune teller was not punished, but on the first opportunity the carpenter started to defraud others the same way! He also tricked the daughter of his landlord into marrying him by ""predicting"" that he is her true love... He becomes rich defrauding people. Any remorse? No. He is very happy and remembers the old fortune-teller with warmth.Needless to say that the book went back were it came from, without my son reading it ...I give the book a star more than it deserves for the illustrations."
1,Could NOT Get This Remote to Work,"I bought this remote to use with my Ipod 20G with Clickwheel and, despite installing as instructed, I could not get this to operate. It fit the Ipod very well, so I figured I would not have a problem. I have also used Maxell products in the past and also haven't had any problems. The remote lit up, but it would not operate any of the functions when I pointed it at my Ipod. Maybe this is a great product and I did something wrong, but it is easy to install and mine would not work. I returned the remote to Amazon as defective and received a refund for it. Again, this might be a great product, but I wanted to write a review to warn other customers that I had problems with it."
1,to star or not to star?,Unless you are familiar with eastern culture this flick will look strange. On top of this this piece of life cut out of bigger picture which is communism and to understand movie properly I recommend to spend some time in Cuba or Serbia as regular person not a tourist.
5,Good Product for My Needs,I mounted these lights on the rear of my enclosed car trailer. I use them at night when parking or loading/unloading the trailer. They provide good light with the 35 watt bulbs and do not use too much power. They have held up well in all kinds of weather and so far the mounting brackets have not rusted.
5,2012 Moose Hunt,I mounted these lights on my atv for the 2012 Maine moose hunt. They worked great. I was worried that brush and small branches would damage them but they held up great and really lit up the trails. They were also very easy to install and had all the neccessary hardware
4,WARN ATV TRAIL LIGHTS,"I purchased the Warn 62018 ATV trail lights to replace the orginal head lights on my honda ATV. These are not head lights, but trail lights. Oher than that, they are well constructed with good wireing harness and good instructions for installation."
2,BETTER SEAL THEM YOURSELF FIRST!!!!!,"JUST GOT A SET OF WARN TRAIL LIGHT FOR CHRISTMAS. MOUNTED THEM ON A SUZUKI KING QUAD BUMPER WHICH PUTS THEM 2 FEET OFF THE TRAIL AND THE FIRST TIME OUT ,BOTH OF THEM GOT MUDDY WATER IN THEM. THIS WAS FROM SPLASHING MUD, NEVER HAD THEM UNDERWATER. THESE LIGHTS NEED TO BE DESIGNED TO WITHSTAND MUDDY TRAIL USE WITHOUT GETTING MUD INSIDE!!!!!"
2,X,"This product doesnt smell really like ""new car"" its a weird smell i couldnt describe, won't buy again"
1,no purchase,"i buy this 4 days ago, the smell is nonexistent. not buy this. by the way, all odorizants auto sell by amazon it's low quality"
2,Why release something if you have nothing to say?,"I understand that not every release is going immediately become a favorite -- just look at the differences in opinion on other u-Ziq releases -- but toss-offs like this really irritate me. You don't HAVE to release a single ahead of every full-length. This one seems like an afterthought. ""My Little Beatiful"" did too, but had a little more meat than ""The Fear.""The title track is appealing, but it never progresses much past its initial hooks of a diva going ""blah blah the fear, the fear blah blah,"" and some sampled strings. Tracks two and three? Hardly worth a description. It's not that they're horrible, they're just bland. I put more thought into pouring myself a bowl of Golden Grahams this morning. For die-hards only."
2,It was a bust,There really was no detail about play areas for children. Very much s dimpl over view of playgrounds and was very limited.
5,Wow.......,"Did not expect an album as great as this.... Sure it's my favorite band, but I thought it would all be wierd.... This album is pretty heavy, especially for a KoRn album.... Sometimes I forget it's them.... I definately recommend buying this CD, along with all of their other CD's, sometime in the near future..... Peaceward...."
5,ONE OF KORNS BEST ALBUMS,"I think this is one of their best albums. It seems that their first two albums were more metal/nu metal and that's how I like Korn to be most of the time. ISSUES, UNTOUCHABLES, and SEE YOU ON THE OTHER SIDE were albums that were very much alike. The band messed around with special effects with the guitars and I like that stuff, but I like the other style a little better. FOLLOW THE LEADER was an album that was unique and had it's own style. I like their self titled album, LIFE IS PEACHY and TAKE A LOOK IN THE MIRROR. This album was one of my favorites because I like how it brings back their older style. Another thing about this album that I liked was the bass in this album. It really stood out in a way that it never did before in this band. So this one def one of my favorites by Korn and I think the band needs to do more styles like this :)"
1,ooo the pain the pain of it all,"""SHUT UP, Or i will **** you up""??this album comes with many warning stickers ""course lanuage"" ""mature audience"" well i think its missing one ""WARNING: S**tty lryics, adn horrable guitar riffs may course deafness""the first five korn albums rule, but this.... this is horrible the lyrics seem to be as though they where written by shaved monkeys with a crayons. Expected these monkeys have only learnt some words of the english language. and they where "" PAIN HURT AND HATE"" Pain appears over 10 times on this album.the guitaring is even worse and made me want to cry.anyone could play these songs with the one finger or for that matter their Di*K.don't buy this album or better yet buy it and burn it so no one will ever hear it.you will have saved someones ears and time"
4,alot better then their last three albums,"Not their greatest album but way better then their last three. Love the fact that Fieldy's bass sounds awesome on this album, and John brought the bag pipes back. Songs that stick out are Alive and Im Done. The only song im not too crazy about is Play Me with rapper Nas. it sounds way too lame. but all and all, a good cd."
4,Take A Look In The Mirror,"Well what can I say, this album is pretty good, not as great as Issues. The best song has to be ""counting on me"", and ""did my time"",as well as ""everything I've known"". The song ""play me"" with Nas was a bad combination due to his rapping style, this album on the other hand this album gives you some of that classic Korn sound from their first and fourth albums,such as their first single ""Blind"""
4,Fun Series,"By this far in the series you know what you are getting. If you like the previous One Tree Hills, you will like this."
5,one tree hill,i will missy one tree hill when it is over all the season of it was good and i cant want to get one tree hill season 9 on dvd
5,Why did they leave out Gavin Degraw,"The series finale was great, loved watching Gavin Degraw perform the TITLE SONG with the actors singing along! Why was that left off of the dvd release? Disappointed...."
4,A good conclusion a serious soap,"The components of this drama are love, reparation and redemption and change.There is action, racial and respect owed to women/.The Question - What is the role of sex in a relationship and its meaning- rarely touch on or exam - the only thing parents generally say and religious leaders is don't which isd nmopt positive or helpful since many who are teaching or proting sex never exam orb explore with the coming of age of the young.Commitment"
4,Good,This product was very well packaged and arrived in a good amount of time. Loved the show And the price was perfect.
1,"Marketing hype for RFID, nothing more","This book was a HUGE dissapointment for me. I have plenty of ""For Dummies"" series books and this is the only one that really let me down.The whole book is written by a person who works for the RFID industry. He does not spend any time explaining the security and privacy issues involved with RFID. He makes a childish remark that ""RFID is like credit card, it can be tracked""...BUT FORGETS TO MENTION that RFID can be tracked wireless every time everywhere, while your credit card can only be tracker where YOU CHOOSE TO USE IT.Concidering the recent issues of RFID read/copy/forgery with even latest ""high security passports"" (like the ones used in EU), this book is really a HUGE thumbsdown. Dont buy it."
4,RFID for dummies is an intelligent overview of the field,"The author is clearly knowledgable of the 'hows and whys' of RFID technologies. For a professional need to get a running start at implementing RFID technology, this will be a useful starting point to quickly get up to speed on the technology. Recommended..."
4,Pre-schooler,"I've read some of the other reviews stating that this lunch box is small. I purchased this for my son who started pre-school and it works great for what we need. It holds his sandwich container and juice box and whatever else I include; apple sauce, fruit snacks, etc. It isn't the size of an adult lunch box, but do you really need something large for a pre-schooler?"
4,"Extremely useful, nicely written","For anyone needs a quick understanding of the petroleum catalysis business, this book is a MUST."
5,Wonderful cd,"I paid my [money] for this 2 disc set, and I got [more] in music. This cd changed the way I felt about paying money for anime soundtracks. Before, I was skeptical about paying the extra money because a cd was from Japan. Now, I just recieved my 7th soundtrack in the mail and am broke, but happy. As for the cd, as a fan of Megumi's work, I am extremely satisfied with this cd. All the openings, endings, and songs in between from the Slayers series that I deemed worthy are in here. In fact, the only song that is missing is Midnight Blue, a personal favorite of mine. Oh well. The remixes and addon songs make up for it. While I keep this one at home, I listen to this cd almost constantly.To sum things up: buy this cd. You'll thank me in the long run."
1,Disappointed!,"I thought it was a good price for this fun package but when I received it in the mail, it was missing BASIC STAMP and Serial Programming Cable. What's the point of a kit? I expected all the necessary acessories to be included on the kit. I gave it as a gift but decided to return it once I realized my friend had to spend a lot of money to actually use this."
3,Half a Robot,"As others have noted, the ""kit"" here doesn't really include everything you need to build a robot. What you get is a bare-bones platform that requires, at a minimum, a remote control you need to build from parts you supply. What it really needs for full functionality is a Basic Stamp processor- which costs a bit more than this kit- and a computer to prgram the Basic Stamp. Given all that, yes, you'll have a simple robot.This isn't a kit for kids; I'd recommend it for someone who already has some good skills at electronic assembly and is looking for a not-too-expensive program to experiment with. For younger (middle school and below) kids, I'd recommend the Lego Mindstorms robotics kits."
5,Lots of fun,This kit was a lot of fun.It was the first time I tried to make something like this and I thought that I might have some trouble but I followed the instructions and the robot worked just like advertized.I plan to pick up another one of these kits soon (probably Robot Challenge Kit).
3,Just OK,"The sound quality is fine. I'm not sure where they got these versions of the songs, but they generally seem more hurried from the ones I remember. Maybe I changed. It's hard to make a bad version of Puff and this recording has a great version. However, why rush ""Lemon Tree"" or ""Where Have All the Flowers Gone?""? I'm in no hurry and appreciate being carried along with the song/music instead of trying to run to keep up."
3,"Its Just Not the Same Peter, Paul & Mary","This CD is well produced and is probably, technically, better than the original recordings. The problem is that the original Peter, Paul, & Mary recordings were songs that reflected the current times and concerns. Lyrics written by Dylan, and sung with emotional import. These characteristics do not come through in the 2005 remake. I would recommend the ""10th Anniversery"" CD instead."
5,Great compendium,The 60s folk scene is all wrapped up here. Great bargain - 25 songs for less than $9...$0.36 per song!
5,Puff the Magic Dragon lives on...,"as do Stewball and friends on this CD. If you are a Peter, Paul and Mary fan, this is a winner!!! It has everything on it, including several of their individual (solo) hits. I am VERY happy to have ""The Very Best of..."" in my collection."
2,CD,"When we travel ,like to listen favorite music in car --for some reason CD was skipping sooooo badly that we could not enjoy.The other CD PETER, PAUL and MOMMY worked just fine."
5,The Best of the Best!,"Thanks for offering this selection on Amanzon. I loved the music then....and appreciate it more NOW. It took me ""BACK""...Eileen"
4,The best of the folk trio...,...is really worth owning. Timeless songs that are each in their own way little masterpieces. Where are the folk trios like this of today?
2,Fun but 1 of 2 purchased doesn't work,"I bought 2 of these, one for each of my children age 6. They think it is a fun toy. However, there must be something wrong with one of them. I put in a new battery and the next day the battery was dead. Repeated. Same result."
1,Nothing novel here!?,"Just received Dark Side of Oz which is a CD copy of Dark Side of the Moon and a VHS of Wizard OZ.The ad appeared to sell a synched DVD that contains sound of DSOTM with the Wizard of OZ movie, IT DOES NOT.The fine print at the end of the ad states ""box set"" for Pink Floyd CD and Wizard of OZ movie. WTF.Amazon get rid of these flying monkees please.Be well, Chris"
2,BORRRING......................,"I have read every book of Steel's. Some of her books are no more than a long, short story. This one fits that bill. The book is small and the print is large.This book is all about a widowed man who has a passion for sailing. Everything about him revolves around sailing. He tells everyone he meets about sailing and his boat. Did I mention how much he enoys sailing? It becomes redundent. We get it. Move on.Guess its nice to be so rich and not have to write substantial material anymore. At least save your money and check the book out from the library. I paid .50 for a ""hold fee"". I think it was worth .25 !!"
3,Not the best,"It was ok. It took me a while to get into it. Once I did, it was over. Not necessarily boring, but it took me way too long to read it."
2,Dull as Dishwater,"I finished listening to this audio CD and was very ""underwhelmed"". Danielle Steel is using the same old storylines over and over again, perhaps thinking her readers won't notice. Believe me, we do. The main characher of Quinn Thompson is so dull that after a while it's all one can do to think, Who Cares? The man is obsessed by sailing and playing liar's dice - a real bore. The storyline of the illiterate carpenter could have been an intriguing one, with some good potential for story development. Instead, Quinn teaches him to read in a few short lessons, and soon the guy is in college studying to be an architect! Pretty unrealistic. The character of Maggie is one-dimensional, as well. Overall, it's a dull, predictable story. If you want to read/listen to great Danielle Steel, go to her older works: The Dating Game, The Wedding, and Answered Prayers are among the best."
5,BOOK,IF YOU WANT TO BELIEVE IN LOVE AND MIRACLES I RECOMAND THAT YOU READ THIS BOOK. AND ANY THING WRITEN BY DANIELLE STEEL!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,"Awful, plastic junk","I just Ordered this, should get it in a week, looks to have a lot of stuff in it but i have heard bad reviews for the Intec headphones and screen protecters.... I ordered it when this package was $10.00 i mainly wanted the case, dock charger, and car charger so i will post again when i find out how they are*UPDATE* Its crap, all of it except the car charger.. the ""dock charger"" is just a plastic stand without a charger at all you just plug your normal cable into it. LAME! Zero Stars if I could */UPDATE*"
5,It's pretty good,"Lots of people say that this game is horrible and stuff... But don't listen to them. At the core of this game you find a loveable on-th-rails hack n' slasher. True that there are lots of problems with this game, but everything else makes up for them."
2,Didn't learn much,"As a ""dog person"", I have to say that I learned very little specifically about boxers from this book. There is some standard stuff about dogs in general ""Fleas feed on a dog by biting and sucking its blood. Their bites often cause severe itching..."" Who doesn't know this information? Even children can tell you this without reading this (price) book. The stuff which is specific to boxers (breed standards, health information) can easily be obtained by an internet search. The only reason I gave it two stars is that some of the photographs are nice. I don't reccomend buying this book."
2,Monstrous!,It is huge. Definitely not well suited to pack on a trip to Europe. Consequently I returned it. Should have been more attentive to dimensions before ordering it.
3,I expected more,"I have to admit I was a little disappointed with this item. I thought it would be something that my students could use to quiz themselves with and really learn the multiplication table from. It's handy for self-quizzing, but not so much for really learning the tables with."
2,Does NOT fit my Drill!!!,"Extremely disappointed with this purchase, and more importantly Ridgid tools in general. Apparently Ridgid does not have a proprietary standard for its batteries to fit their products, but after I purchased 2 of these batteries to replace the 2 batteries which mysteriously died after only 2 years of use (and were only used about 3 times a year), they would not fit my drill. My dad has el-cheapo brand Ryobi cordless tools, and has his batteries have lasted him for years and years and they still work! To make matters worse, to return this item, I would have to pay the $16 again to ship it back (for a total of $32), plus face up to a 50% restocking charge ($40)! It is actually more beneficial to not return them and go purchase other Ridgid tools to use these batteries on, than to return them! This is a terrible pickle to be in!The only reason I gave it two stars instead of one is because I technically never got to even test the battery with my drill."
4,Wrong cover image?,"The CD I received is not the one pictured but the 2005 re-release that has a yellow cover and 3 additional tracks. The extra tracks are the ""Radio Edit""(s) listed above that are not on the original CD release that is actually pictured. A moot point though since they are extra tracks, but it's always annoying when item images are not correct. It took a bit of searching to figure out what it was I had received, what initially concerned me was that track #7 is actually mislabeled with a number '2' although it is actually track '7' and is the 7th track listed. The misprint made me think it might have been a pirated disc, especially since the album cover looks like garbage compared to the original.As for the band, absolutely love them and have had the original album from iTunes for years now. Looking forward to doing a FLAC rip and enjoying them even more!"
3,good spoof western,older style movie great if you love this type of spoof western great cast 2 movies for the cost of one great seller would buy from again
3,Too Primitive - Introduction Level,"It is an introductionary level book. The only good thing is it provides an integrated example through out the book, and adds more features and components with introduction of Stateless, Stateful, Entity, Message Driven bean in each chapter."
1,old perfume,"I have not been happy with this perfume at all. It smells like old perfume. What a waste of money. I would not recommend buying this. Instead, spend a bit more and get a smaller quantity at a department store where it will be guaranteed to be fresh (and if its not, it will be a heck of a lot easier to return)."
3,My idea didn't pan out,"It didn't work out as I had hoped, but that isn't the sellers fault. I was trying to cover it with a crocheted cover, and even 2 ply yarn was too thick to work. The button wouldn't snap together. I'll try it again with light weight fabric."
2,B grade ?,Don't expect something like Chic - songs are mainly constructed with crude 80s sampling and drum machines. There are some songs with good bass lines and also rodgers' very percussive guitar technique. These are interesting but they don't make it worth the while to import the CD.
1,PRACTICALLY PERFECT WEDDING,"VERY USEFUL IN PLANNING ANY WEDDING. I'VE WRITTEN MY 1ST CERAMONY AND AM VERY HAPPY WITH ALL THE GUIDENESS, ALL THE IDEAS AND HELP FROM THE BOOK. I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS BOOK"
4,Worth the sale price!,"Works well and the settings are nicely adjustable. Provides an even toast on bread, English muffins and bagels. Buttons are easy to push, knobs turn nicely too.I like that it was on sale too."
2,"Looks nice, very uneven toasting","The unit has good looks, and is stable with the wide base. The dial works well and allows for fine adjustments in toasting. I haven't tried all the buttons yet, I doubt I will ever use them. What I do NOT like about this toaster is how uneven it toasts. Some parts of the bread are still white, other parts are well toasted, this all over the surface of the bread. Looking into the toaster, you can see that some of the filaments bulge out a little from the support board, while others are almost buried in them. I have seen other reviews where even toasting is mentioned. I'm thinking there is a QA issue here. I got the unit for free, but if I had paid $45 for it, I would have returned it.I might fiddle with the heater wires to get better coverage."
3,Toaster Review,They have made the toaster look less sturdy with the latest model. Would have kept the old one but the element went out.
2,Not a good toaster,"I have my toaster set on the lowest heat setting and even on the lowest setting, toast comes out medium to dark brown. I like my toast light brown and I don't get it with this toaster unless I stand over it and manually pop up the bread. Buyers' remorse.Cuisinart CPT-180 Metal Classic 4-Slice Toaster, Brushed Stainless"
2,"Shoddy product, terrible company","My toaster lasted about three years before it started to burn everything which was long enough to forget who spent so much money for it (Crate and Barrel) for our wedding. When you do not have a receipt, the company counts the warranty (which is for three years) start date from the date of manufacture. When I gave them my serial number, they told me my toaster was five years old. Buy the cheapest toaster you can find. It will probably last 20 years. Buy this $60 one and expect it to last three years."
1,"Terrible, awful toaster","Believe what you read...the reviews don't lie...its a TERRIBLE toaster. Toasts only on one side - I mean really...in this day and age, how hard is it to make a toaster that toasts both sides of the bread??? I assumed my first one was broken, but the second one behaves just like the first one. What a waste...wish I had checked these reviews first. I just didn't think I had to for a toaster."
5,WOW!!,Toasts super fast and looks amazing in kitchen. The levers seem a little cheap but Im so glad I bought this one
3,Pretty toaster,The toast has to be turned to brown evenlyWhich is a little disappointing . But I like the color and it does toast so mission accomplished.Don't know if I'd get ahain
5,Perfect Toast!,"This was a replacement for an old toaster i had. I've always trusted the Cuisinart brand, having had one of their food processors. I'm loving this toaster so far. I would recommend this toaster to my friends."
2,Failed after 1.5 yrs,"This toaster was O.K. at best.The buttons did not seem to really do any thing and just made it more complicated then it needed to be.LED on the front where always on. I don't need this in a toaster.A middle element blew out so it made it ineffective, and junk.For the money it should have lasted 20 yrs."
2,"Looks great, but toasts terribly!","I bought this toaster from a local store. It looked great. It was sturdy with a cool contemporary, yet retro design. Unfortunately, it toasts very unevenly. One side of the toast is well toasted and the other side is barely toasted. I tried the bagel setting, thinking that it may be ""stuck"" on that setting, but the unevenness became worse. I love the look of this toaster so much that I returned and exchanged it 2 different times just to see if I could luck out and find one that worked, but they were all defective. The third toaster I brought home to try toasted just as unevenly as the 1st and the 2nd. What a waste of time. Too bad."
2,Great stainless looks but poor performance,"Lately, I have been disappointed with Cuisinart products where style and appearance seem to have more importance than kitchen tool performance. This toaster suffers from slots a bit too small and uneven toasting. Settings range from 1 to 6 but anything above 3 creates a burnt slice. Finding the right setting between 2 and 3 is just too narrow of a range. The other settings, such as bagel, etc don't seem to do anything different. I would have return it, but we are not near the store."
1,Not worth the money,My husband and I received this toaster for our wedding three years ago. It did what a toaster is supposed to do and worked fine until about a month ago. Now the lever will not stay down to toast the bread. For the money I expected this product to last longer then three years. I won't be purchasing another Cuisinart toaster.
5,Works Fine!,"Have had no problems at all with this unit. Does a fine job on bagels as well as bread. Got mine at Costco for $49.00, that makes it even better.I have had none of the negative experieces of others. I just wonder if their power supply is ample for a four slicer.....Hmmmm."
4,This is what I expected,This toaster is what I expected it to be. It toasts well and looks reasonably nice. Some of the buttons are a bit ' plasticy'.
1,2 Time Loser,"I purchased this toaster twice, sadly. The first time, right out of the box one side of the toaster would not stay down when depressed. I returned that and got another one. This one worked for about 2 months, then again, one side of the toaster would not stay down. I contacted Cuisinart and asked if there was a known defect. They simply stated, just return your toaster, it is broken. You can return it to the store, since you had it under 90 days or return it to us and we will replace it. Of course, I would have to pay all shipping charges, which turned out to be almost as much as the toaster.Based on my experience, I would avoid this one.UPDATE: I have been using another stainless toaster for over a year now that I got for $19.99 and have no issues! LOL!"
1,Don't Buy It,Piece of junk. Does not toast evenly. One side of bread will be burned and the other side not toasted at all.
2,"Ok, until it broke","I was very happy with this toaster for about a year, and then the right side handle broke off. I'm looking for a new toaster, but it won't be this one"
2,After three years it doesn't toast anymore,"I bought this toaster a little over three years ago. After two years I began to have to crank up the dials to get a nice toast on my slices. I have to crank the dial to it's top level to get a nice toast. In a few months as this is going, it will be in the trash. I think a nice looking toaster like this should keep working longer. It is a lot of stainless to only be good for 3.5 years."
2,"Nice, but it broke down","About three years after we bought this, the leftmost of the four slots stopped toasting. A few months later, bread in the left two slots would not stay down--the only way to toast was to hold the handle down the whole time (and the leftmost slot still doesn't heat up). I feel I paid premium price for a low-quality product."
5,Pretty!,"We bought this toaster to match our remodeled 50s style kitchen, and it's worked well for the three years we have had it. It toasts well. I'm hoping it will last 5 more years at least."
1,Crapinart?,"Cuisinart, you MUST be kidding. The toaster arrived covered in dust, handprints, rust spots and missing the crumb tray. Great ""crapsmanship"" made in China. It looks like it was stored in a garage for years, pulled off a shelf and packaged to be sold as new by Cuisinart from China. It was returned as soon as I opened it. It was clearly NOT previously opened and sold by Amazon as NEW and not a marked-down item. I expect better. MUCH better, as I see these in gourmet cooking/kitchen stores."
2,The Zen Toaster,"All this time, I thought it was me!I've had this toaster several years, and have never been able to figure out how to toast both side of an english muffin or piece of bread. One side is well done, and the other is barely toasted; you can see the difference between the two electric grills by looking into the toaster and you can see that one is barely red while the other is bright red. I finally assumed that this was intentional, because it is so consistent. I sometimes flip them over and redo them so both sides are toasted.Also, the two settings knobs that control the intensity of the toasting are unreliable from day to day. A setting that is perfect today will burn to a crisp tomorrow. We call it ""The Zen Toaster"" because you never know each day how it will decide to work."
1,I'm not buying another one of these.,I bought the chrome version of this toaster. First the grease from the stove ate the chrome away and had permanent spots on it's surface. For a toaster that was bought mainly for it's looks this was very bad. Then roughly a year after we bought it the lever doesn't stay down so we can't use it anymore. My next toaster is going to be a $15 from Target.
3,Mine died,"We liked this toaster it did a nice job but at the end of two weeks it went pop and it was over. Otherwise a nice toaster, we got ours at Sams Club for $50.00."
2,Another Expensive Junky Toaster.,"Here's another expensive piece of junk toaster that I was conned into buying. Actually I went off the consumer reports web-site that gave the two slice model top ratings, so I thought this one was a good gamble... Not.As you will read in many of the other reviews, this toaster will not cook each side of the toast evenly. It will not center the toast perfectly and the elements do not heat up evenly in any direction, so don't expect it to ever do a good job. Changing from type of bread or to a different age of bread, has you constantly adjusting the temperature setting, which in the end always results in either one side burnt or one side white.Also you have to turn the toaster around to get at the extremely shallow crumb trays. And lets not forget that mine wouldn't even sit level!When it comes to buying a toaster, forget about consumer reports, and please don't buy this piece of junk. And if your still not convinced, read the other reviews."
3,"Okay, but could be better ...","My husband & I got this toaster for Christmas - I loved it because of the unique style - looks great ... After using it a few times, I have to agree with the reviews ... you never know what color your toast is going to come out! One of the button's on my toaster is wrong, says defrost but it is actually the cancel button, just put in the wrong cover at the factory, when I called to have it fixed ... they told me I would have to pay to send it to them to be fixed ... it was brand new out of the box !!!"
5,I picked out a wine that the boss liked!,"All I knew about wine was what I liked. I didn't know how to tell someone what that might be. So I decided to pick this up, and I've had great success with my adventures. I don't mind spending a little money on a bottle of wine, but I don't like to waste it. This book has made me both more brave, and more successful with my wine adventures!"
5,Absolutely Great!,"I love this book. It's a breeze to read, fun and easy to understand, and it has finally explained the world of wine to me. Before I got it, all I knew was that old rule: white with poultry/fish, red with beef/veal. There's so much more to wine! If you're interested in wine and would like to start from the very beginning, this book is a keeper."
1,HORRIBLE!! HORRIBLE!!! HORRIBLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This was the worst software purchase I've ever made. I wish I looked at the two reviews in before making a decision! I live outside Philadelphia, which is the 5th largest city in the USA. After buying the software and going to all the trouble to download, register, etc, I find out they don't even have a map available for download for the Philadelphia area!!!!!!!!WORTHLESS!Now my money is wasted. Buy.com will not take back a return(only store credit less shipping and handling) so I'm f*cked out of 40 bucks and more importantly my valuable time.A totally and completely worthless product. DO NOT BUY!"
2,"Lighs, Camera, No Action","When I read the sample the story looked to be a really good one. Unfortunately thats pretty much where the story ended was with the sample.The main character Shannon was completely unlikable. She doesn't give an inch the whole book. She's rude and really only cares about one thing. Herself. By the time she actually cares about something else thre are only about 10 pages left in the book.The hero in the book, Cade, is pretty likable. However, he's a little wishy washy and a glutton for punishment as to how he's treated by Shannon.I do believe the author could've made this book really work had the characters been... well more likable. I just couldn't get into the story or love story between these two. Sorry.And cut!! Fade to black..."
3,Good but not great,"I was a bit leary about this when I got it, but was hoping for the best. He's Mr Nice and she's Ms Neurotic and it was not in a cute way. I found her to be demanding, lacking confidence and generally annoying."
3,Steno and transcription?!?!,"What era does this woman live in?!? Senior EA's raise your hands...how many of you have *ever* done steno work? How many of you consider this a ""crucial"" skill to achieving a high level EA position? More to the point, how many of you have ever even committed the act? Sure, there are positions out there that require it - a few. They tend to say so in the recruiter' descriptions because it's so unusual.The rest of the book may be great - I don't know. I stopped right there."
2,Disappointed,"This is another example of hearing ""the same ole stuff."" Can't some author get origional? This was so elementary and certainly not ""NEW"" information, as the title suggests."
4,The New Executive Assistant,"It is informative and enjoyable. Not quite what I was looking for, nevertheless shares important insights for job seekers --in a fun to read way -- that definitely don't hurt to know."
1,product to complicated for use,"This product was way more difficult to use than it needed to be!! I am a runner and needed something with all info on one screen. If I wanted to get my speed, I had to push buttons. If I wanted time, push more buttons, and if I wanted distance, I had to push even more. This was nearly impossible running 8 mph. It might work for a walker, but even so, I found a much easier product for everyone. The Garmin 101 was about $10.00 more, but amazing. It shows everything on one screen, it has gps, and as soon as you turn it on, it's ready to go!! The screen is bigger, but not heavy. I run with it, put it on the stroller for a walk, and even ride a bike with it! It starts in feet until you get to .1 of a mile, then it goes by miles!! I wish I had this review while I was shopping!!"
3,It is OK and does not job,"I chose this item to substitute my Nike+ sportsband that I loved but broke it. This Accelerator Running Watch does the job but it is A PAIN to calibrate and involves an obscure exercise of step counting and determining the length of your stride. Once you are done with that, it is pretty accurate and shows you all you need to know while you are running. The drawbacks are that you almost need to stop to see all the numbers and that unlike Nike+ you can't upload your results on line and graph them and see your progress over time. But it does the job otherwise."
3,"It works, but wasn't easy to use","I bought this for my wife a couple of years ago, but never reviewed it. From what I remember, it worked pretty well, but it required some patience and know-how to use this properly."
4,Awesome Buy!,One of the best tihings I've ever purchased! I love top have the ability to keep track of the miles I run and the calories I burn. Because I always suspected that the stats on the treadmill were off. Just wish it came in more colors. I'm not really a girlie girl so wearing a pink watch everyday would be a bit much.
4,Fashionable yet functional.,"This is a great product - lots of functionality for the price you pay! So far it's done everything that I've wanted it to, although I am still figuring out how to use part of it. The pink is a great color that brightens my runs!"
2,Get it online instead....,This is a book for webmasters without a high speed internet connection. Wrox's library for ASP is excellent but this book stands out as a brick (I'm currently using it to keep my stack of takeout menus from falling over). Many of these techniques can be found online at many fine ASP websites. Its not a bad book. It lacks focus and many of the topics can be easily covered in a few articles.
3,Look elsewhere for an ASP book,"This book is not, repeat not, a book to get to learn ASP for the web.It only covers some techniques to tweak your code, speed up applications, etc..It has two very big sections on SQL Server, and Dynamic Web sites from databases. Otherwise, it has very little on ASP."
3,"Useful book, but not a great one.","It's useful if you have full control and access to a live web server. Since I have some background in ASP, IIS 4 and site management, I only found some information is useful."
3,it was ok,"I wsa a big full house fan and collector of the Stephanie books. This book is good but Danny Tanner's character is a little bit too strict and overprotective towards Stephanie, the writer should have studied more Full House episodes to get a taste of what the characters are like."
3,hilary duff of my time,stephanie was in a series and there were books about it too. I'm just thankful she didn't try a singing career though she was a really good dancer on the show
2,Purchased for a Stanley steel door,"I purchased this as a replacement for a Stanley steel door. However the dimensions were not the same and after installation the magnet surface did not quite reach the door satisfactorily. In addition, the magnet did not have the same strength as the original. don't get me wrong, this is a fine product, but see if you can double check the needed dimensions before you are ready to purchase."
3,check size,"I have an old Stanley metal door. This product was also marketed as a Stanley product. It comes with three pieces, one for the handle side of the door, one for the top side, and one for the hinge side. Replacement was fairly easy (I used a board and hammer to fully seat the door side, as the dead bolt was binding a bit. Unfortunately, the piece for the hinge side of the door was substantially thicker than the original piece, and the door would not close. I put the original piece back in and everything worked. My leaks were on the handle side of the door, so my problem is solved. But if your leaks are on the hinge side of the door, this product won't help."
2,Not as festive as Viva La Musica,"Loved their fantastic first CD -- especially since it was a divergence from the standard Gipsy Kings. Unfortunately, they regress back to their roots. A poor showing this time."
5,Are We Not Men? We Are Devo!,"Jade Dellinger & David Giffels have done their homework and dug deeply for the truth. I now see the extreme complexity in the development of the DE-evolutionary theories. I now understand how DEVO began, and evolved themselves, to create the wealth of material that has become fundamental to many throughout the world. Revealed is the internal drive that these creators of art & music used to forge through the common complacencies of industrial socio political & corporate madness around them. The fight that DEVO won, and for most fans never lost. The book is captivating through and through. Excellent in depth info on the ""formative"" years. Excellent pictures. I hope there are more ""positive"" books about DEVO in the future. This book has opened the door for that I'm sure."
2,Maybe a better book will be written?,"I like Devo. I like musical biographies. I didn't care for this book. The bulk of the book covers the time before Devo even was Devo and then runs break-neck through their commerical years, barely giving their last 4 releases any ink at all. I'm puzzled as to no mention of Lene Lovich, who hailed from the same area, and also performed a version of ""Be Stiff"" at one point. There was some professional affiliation there, but it was never mentioned in the book. It's not a bad book, but for me it wasn't a good read. Most books like this I read in one to two days. This one took over four weeks. I just couldn't get engaged until the last portion of the book, and by then they're so dismissive of anything Devo did after Freedom of Choice, it's like ""why bother""? Obviously others found it a better read then me."
2,Not really a Tru Devo Bio,"There are a lot of factual ERRORS and assumptions in this book. It also focuses a lot on DEVO pre-1976 with former collaborator Bob Lewis as their primary source, and not much on when they were a functioning Warner Brothers recording group or their successful post their Enigma career. The writing style is amateurish. I expected more from the first book about DEVO."
3,You can buy it much cheaper if you search,My father brought this vanity for me as a birthday gift last year. I own the matching canopy bed which he also brought my husband & I as a house warming present. The only reason I gave the product 3 stars is the company selling it is charging way too much money for it. My father brought it at a local furniture store for $75 and when I told him how much I seen it for online he was shocked. Another thing they have my bed on here for almost $700 when he only paid $150 for it. I am sure you can probably find in cheaper online or looking in your neighborhood.
4,Good,"Anyone who found the Warrior Within & Tao of JKD to be interesting will probably like this book, especially the near the end."
3,Decent for what it is...,"Its a film featuring The Insane Clown Posse... Dont go in expecting superb acting or a classic. Im a fan of ICP, dont get me wrong, and I even found myself hoping they win and hack up the bad guy. For what it is, its good. The camera is annoyingly wavey during the scenes in the ""Red Zone"". A few scenes can get irritating, with the camera replaying something about 10 times, and the cut from the camera just as someones head's getting splattered by a vehicle is a let down. It doesnt really live up to the ""Blood"" as it says on the cover, but its decent. Im sure theres going to be reviewing the film solely over being ICP fans... but the film gets a 3. And thats really all it is. Its worth a rental. A few laughs. And the promotion of ICP's The Calm album."
5,me encanta,"siempre ha sido mi olor favorito en perfumes para damas. tengo tiempo usandolo, por eso lo compro anual. huele divino"
2,"Not too bad, just not for me!!!",I really like sweet perfumes that have fruity tones to it. Reading the reviews and every one saying how sweet it is I decided to try it. Honestly this is not sweet at all... Its very flowery. As you first spray it it does give kind of bubble gum smell but than it becomes really strong floral fragrance and not sweet at all... So for those who like sweet fruity perfumes this is not the one. You rather stick with the original Paris Hilton perfume... Which I believe have more of a fruity undertone than this one. I am not a big fan of flowery smells... For those who like flowery smells this one might be the right one for you.
1,The scentless perfume,"I read the reviews for this perfume, and due to the ""good"" reviews thought I would chance it. I have not only drenched myself in this perfume, but drenched my daughter with it and... WHERE IS THE SCENT? It has at first a ""hint"" of something and then gone. It's like getting a piece of gum and after 1min the flavour if it had any at all is completely gone. WOULD NOT BUY NOR TAKE A RISK ON THIS PERFUME!!!!!!"
3,not quite what I had in mind,"I bought this book to supplement my very large collection of traditional ""healthy"" vegetarian cookbooks - I was looking for very kid friendly meals, really there isn't a lot in here that isn't in my adult books.Also from the write up I thought it would contain ""normal"" food that I could cook when my kids friends came round to visit instead some of the recipes are quite obscure ie:apple, sauerkraut and pepper jack quesadilla.I think it is fine to get some new spins on traditional vegetarian food but not the comforting kid food I was looking for. Also several of the recipes I've made so far were very bland - considering I can't tolerate salt very well or enjoy spicy food that is saying something.On the positive side some of the main dish vegetables are very good and I will def be serving them.I felt like I misread the product explanation when I bought this book - but looking back I didn't"
1,Don't waste your money,I am incredibly disappointed in this book. It's very dated and a terrible format. These dishes are supposed to be for my family? There is NO way my kids or husband would touch any of these dishes. Don't waste your time or money.
3,Similar to Nick Hornby's writing,"I haven't read Man and Boy, but it sounds like it may be better than this one. I enjoyed this one, though. It sort of reminded me of Nick Hornby's About a Boy in parts, although the two main characters aren't very similar.I gave it three stars because there probably are better books around, but if you happen to find yourself with this one in hand, it's not a bad read. There are some good characters in the book (the Chinese family who run the restaurant, The main character's parents and grandmother, the foreign students at the Churchill Language School, Plum and her obnoxious classmates, etc.)To wrap up, I liked it enough that I was willing to do enough research to track down Man and Boy, another book by the same author. I guess that's a reasonably decent recommendation."
2,Not like him,"I read his books ""Man and boy"" and Man and wife"" and they were terrific. Those books had rare insight and deep rich characters. This book doesn't even resemble his writing at all. It's boring and one dimensional. I didn't even finish it."
4,"Still looking for great, but this is good","I'm still looking for the great book on J2ME, but in the meantime this is better than what was out before. The code samples still dominate and have little commenting to make them clear. But there is better exposition in this book. And the authors give some perspective as to why things work they way they do, and give some best practice style advice, which is appreciated.Certainly the best J2ME out on the market as of May 2005."
4,"Good book, few examples","J2ME From Novice to Professional is a good book. However, there are few exapmles, dispite clear."
2,2 years later,am reviewing after 2 years...it is a nice looking nik nak to sit in my living room as a new player could never get it to tune...even the guitar tech for the new riders couldnt do it says the bridge is not right...so i enjoy looking at it and struming the dust off every few months
4,Animal Walking Fun,"The walks are clearly described in the directions. The songs are fun and will keep kids entertained. Good for rainy day activities, or learning about animals. Adults can move with the kids and create their own animal walks as well. This is a great opportunity to stretch the imagination."
4,Comprehensive,This offers a comprehensive overview of the daily details of living in Canada. It does not provide much information for retiress wishing to move or live there.
3,Cool or Clown?,"If there's one good thing that came out of Dutch colonialism, it has to be the musical influence. Def Rhymz combines the Dutch language with hints of Surinam, for example his song ""Schudden"" about, ehm, shaking behinds. Even if you don't understand Dutch, his music is fun, although you would miss how he plays with words. In ""Ziek"" you can hear a sexy female vocal, like in ""Doekoe"" in contrast with Def's raw voice. This is definately not serious music, it's for fun and fun only. We are after all talking about an artist who knocked his front teeth out by jumping into a fence during a performance!"
2,CHEAP & BAD,"This camera is awful. I bought it a year ago. Painfully slow between shots, often freezes and have to pop the batteries out to reset it. Eats batteries in less than 30 mins. Requires TONS of light, and the flash sucks. You get close enough for the flash to work and the picture is washed out, step 1 foot back and it is too dark. The picture quality leaves lots to be desired. 2 good things... The video record is decent (outside with lots of natural light) and the voice recorder is excellent (used it at a few clubs to record bands and was pleased). Other than those two qualities this camera sucks for taking pictures! You can get better quality for the same price, even a lower price!!"
4,Justin Riggs,"Justin Riggs is a nothing. His dad goes on a routine business trip and his mom thinks he's leaving, so Justin's mom is under depression. Justin's brother, Duane, is getting shipped our to Iraq, and his best friend, Ben, has no time for him sence ben got a girl friend. Then Jemmie Lewis comes along. No longer is Justin in The Big Nothing but he is now in The Big Something."
5,Thanks David Murray,"This is a rich recording. Murray's `big band' writing has matured with each outing to the point that I don't want to take this one off the box, though I have other new recordings waiting to be played. Lafayette Gilchrest is a gem here; he has the right tone and temperament for this set. His sound is like an expanded Monk, he goes places you didn't know existed until he plays it.There is a different Murray on this recording, one closer to an earlier recording - Ballads For Bass Clarinet - yet rich and diverse in another way, this one is absent of his traditional upscale hooks and squeals, thought taking nothing away from his sound and display of prowess.The music is related from one tune to the next and the sound quality is excellent.This is consistent David Murray, giving the kind of performance that causes you to collect whatever he has out there. Add this one to yours."
1,Beyond Useless,"I had to use this book in 2 OOAD classes and it was worse than useless due to the need to filter out all of the detritus in an attempt to get to some meaningful information. Poor focus, plodding style, cutesy humor, and ineffective instruction on the theories and practice of OOAD are the key features of this volume. With much better books available on the topic, I could not understand why my school chose this waste of paper as a course text. Unfortunately, selecting zero stars is not a choice when submitting reviews."
3,Average Gaming Headset,"I bought this item to communicate on ventrillo and Skype with friends from around the world, while playing video games. Straight out of the box the mic worked and was a good price for what I was getting. Unfortunately, I had to abandon the headset because it was so uncomfortable to wear. The plastic that goes over your ears hurts pretty bad and leaves your ears raw after you take it off. The mic was excellent though. I started wearing it around my neck with the mic pointed towards my mouth and it worked great. This was the first headset of this type that I have used, so I'm not sure if it is the style or this particular product. However, I have been swayed from buying this style again."
5,On becoming an agent in everyday life,"This is one of the most extraordinary books I have read. It accomplishes a truly philosophical approach to the types of social action that are available in everyday life: in business, politics and culture. Its view of social action as disclosure may bring fundamental changes to the way we cope with our everyday problems.Plato--who may be a model for every philosopher--developed his most important philosophical ideas in the Republic--a book about social action, focused on the most important kind of social action of his time. Disclosing New Worlds does a similar job for the 20th century world (of course, it does not have the ambition to be as comprehensive as Plato's work).This is a book that attempts to develop the reader's level of awareness--to a historical awareness, which is essential to human life, as stressed by Ortega y Gasset. Indispensable reading for whoever has a necessity to think about business and society."
1,A turnoff,The authors try hard to be sexy but the photos make you wish the models had kept their clothes on.
1,"Speed control unit works ok, but not well, cant return it after you open it","They heat up to much and the speed changes on its own. I wanted to return this, but they said no after 1 day of use. Since it is electronic, you can not return the item, which totally is not right. I will never buy again."
3,Work For Me But Not Everyone,"These work sufficiently well for me in the low to moderate noise level environment I use them in; however, I must advise that the vast majority of folks I've let try them can't tell the difference when noise-cancellation is on. I find this mystifying, but whatever - human hearing is quirky, I guess. While it's true the level of noise-cancellation is limited, I find it just enough to let me focus on the sound coming through the speakers rather than the ambient noise. Also, in contrast to noise-isolation, I can still hear it when folks speak to me, or something happens that requires my attention. So, I'll keep using these, but a blanket recommendation isn't possible."
5,Slim Line Casio Men's Wristwatch Rocks!!,"The plastic wrist band on this watch wears out in approx. 6 months. Nonetheless, it's been my favorite watch for several years. It's modest, slim, and has a larger than normal display. It's functional and reasonably priced. I recommend it for sure! SW"
4,Good inexpensive watch,I've had the watch for about two months now and it works fine. I just wish the buttons protruded from the watch body about half as far as they currently do. I believe that would prevent the mode from being accidently changed so often. That said I would buy it again.
1,It was not what I expected.,"I bought the watch because in the picture the numbers looked big enough to read without my glasses. When I got it I realized that the numbers were not big, they just looked big because the watch face is small."
4,A Solid Album,"While not on the same level as other Rufus classics like ""Rufusized"", this self titled LP has more than it's share of charms. The most notable tracks were also big pop hits: ""Sweet Thing"" (great guitar work by Tony Maiden especially on the choruses), the frenetic funk of ""Dance Wit Me"" (ferocius drumming by Andre Fischer), ""Circles"" with it's shifting rhythms and a stomping remake of the Bee Gee's ""Jive Talkin'"" with the funk elements brought to the fore! A good album, but just short of great."
5,the Shunning,"I have read all of Beverly Lewis adult books and long for more. I am intrigued by the stories of Lancaster County Pa. Looking forward to more tales of the simple life. Beverly, thank you very much for soothing ""winter"" reading. I really enjoyed your stories."
2,Tinny.,"If I mixed on these speakers and turned up the bass on the kick drum enough to hear it, it would sound like a taiko drum on a system with a subwoofer."
5,A Candid Look at Medicine,"My rather on-and-off-again interest in medical and health issues prompted me to pick this up when I saw it in the library. It's a wonderful collection of essays, poetry and stories by professionals and ""laymen"" alike, on the mysteries and challenges of medicine. I especially enjoyed the fiction selections, from the story of a woman who hypnotizes the doctor after a dehumanizing and personal exam, from the terror of the doctor who gets stuck with an AIDS patient's needle, to the perversion of all medical ideals in the euthanasia programs of WWII, I found the stories and essays fascinating and almost disturbingly real. You can pick and choose what you like--I'm not much for poetry, but lingered over ""The Good Doctor,"" about the seamier side of the long-standing hierarchical structure in medicine. I highly recommend this anthology."
3,textbook,"order for college courses, served its purpose, quick received and in stated shape, easy way to get required textbooks at lower cost"
5,Perfect,"Works like a charm, a cleaner cut because of three cutting edges, cuts straight through small nails perfectly, sturdy shaft."
5,Read this before you get your pit bull,"This is an excellent book. Easy reading, covers all aspects of owning a pit bull.Please read this book BEFORE you get your dog. It won't encourage nor discourage you from getting a pit bull, you will just know more about why you are deciding toget a pit bull or deciding to not get a pit bull. Pit Bulls are fine dogs, but they are not for everyone. Make sure you have what it takes to be this dog's best friend. Thanks"
1,THIS IS NOT A FOUNTAIN PEN,"BEWARE!!! DESPITE THE PICTURE AND THE PRODUCT DESCRIPTION, THIS IS NOT A FOUNTAIN PEN. IT IS INDEED A BALLPOINT PEN AS THE PRODUCT TITLE INDICATES."
3,Fuji x-D card review,"The product is good but antonline took way too much time to deliver it, about a month!!"
2,Disappointing,"The disparate reviews of Cherrybrook Kitchen Yellow Cake Mix are truly perplexing.I made this mix for the first time and I found the cake to be awful. I followed the directions exactly, but it tasted like cigarette ashes and had a sandy texture.The cake cannot be eaten as is. I have put it in the freezer for now and plan to try to use it in a trifle or something.I am not sure if I would buy this again, although I find it interesting that some people are getting good results. Maybe there is some ""secret"" to getting this cake to turn out well?"
2,Dated,"Warriors of the Rainbow: Strange and Prophetic Dreams of the Indiansby William Willoya, Vinson Brown . 1962This book shows its age, very dated material and not coherent.Tries hard to blend Christianity, Buddhism, Dreams and Native Folklore; the end result is an unpalatable mess. The Buddhist prophesy of Matreya is still 2400 years away... so author/s could be a-waiting for a long time. Hard to believe authors that scatter sources and paste Christian passages ad hock. ** 2 Stars.Black Elk Speaksis so much better."
4,Interesting read...,"The struggles and hardships survived by this family should make us think twice about whining when we've had a bad day at the office, the dog throws up on the carpet, there's a traffic jam on the way home, the cable guy is four hours late, or any of the other happenings we find annoying in our modern lives. (how about that three-day trip to town and back?) As an animal lover, I skimmed over the semi-graphic descriptions of trapping animals. Other than that, an enthralling read."
5,Gorgeous,"Just so lovely that my four year old granddaughter could not resist opening this book. Better still, she carefully turns the pages and studies each flower....now she gets flower lessons on each visit.True passion begins early! Another flower lover is born!"
5,Great for all hair types!,I use this product in between chemical treatments (color) and braiding. It has helped my limit shedding and restored porosity. Great staple for those who frequently experiment with their hair or need to pamper it a bit.
2,"Okay, but......",I had two areas (one on each piece) with chipped wood. I just assumed it was from shipping and hope it did not leave the manufacturer that way.
1,"Absolutely terrible, don't waste your money","What if a high school student, who knew very little about music did a video report on the history of jazz using Windows movie maker?...well it would probably still end up being much better than this DVD. A complete waste of your money and your time (assuming you don't turn it off after 5 minutes). Definitely look elsewhere for your Jazz history."
5,Compact and easy to carry,The mirror folds in half and has a magnified glass on one half and a regular glass on the other. It folds up so that both glasses are covered and protected. It comes in a small case that protects the outside. It is very convenient for those who like to carry smaller bags or purses.
3,Toasts great!,"Again I find myself wishing I could give a product more than one rating because this thing makes great toast. The shade adjuster is great. I'm picky about my toast's color. I found that when I had the tray inserted as pictured, the bottom of my toast burned. No problems since I've flipped the tray over. Wonderful english muffin pizzas come out of this thing too.I'd give it 1 star for safety. Every single toaster I have ever had in my entire life has turned off immediately when the door was opened. This one does not. The heating bars inside stay red even when the door is opened. I've gotten used to hitting the ""stop"" button before opening the door."
4,Cuisinart TOB-50W,"I like this toaster/oven very much. Toast is better than my last B&D machine, and the broiler function works very well. However, my first toaster arrived with a smashed plastic base where the handle mounts on the door. The seller, Abe's of Maine, replaced the machine. The second machine did not have enough glue to hold the handle on the door. I re-glued it, and all is fine now. But, both of my samples had quality problems. One was reparable, one was not. This toaster does not turn itself off when the door is open, nor does the inside rack pull itself out when the door is open. These are two shortcomings, IMO. The controls are easy to understand and use. Overall, I'm happy with this machine."
5,just right,"its the perfect size, i love the chair that comes with it, the mirror is adjustable for upper or lower body view, enough space to fit all beauty products, especially when your a beginner to makeup. I'm always doing my hair at this vanity and i notice my styles come out better than when i was standing up at the bathroom mirror to do my hair, clearly because I'm more comfortable at the vanity."
2,' Pipers' by Donaldson,"I was looking forward to reading this book but was somewhat dissapointed. There is lots ofinteresting information but the author much too often for my taste, inserts his prejudices and bias' of others in the piping world's history, making fun of them and what they did, how they lived, what they wrote, how they played their music etc. It almost seemed as if the author was envious or resentful of their accomplishments. So much of this that it overshadowed the interesting parts. Too much of an agenda not enough substance."
4,Excellent review on the recent semiconductor processing,"This book collects the hot issues on the very recent deep submicron (less than 0.18um) semiconductor process technology, such as EUV lithography, high and low k materials, CMP, and 300mm wafer. It seems to provide a good guideline to anyone who wonders what it is going on in the semiconductor process industry."
5,"Inexpensive, work well and long lasting",These little tea lights work really well. I've used several of them for over 20 hours so far and they are still going strong. All of them have worked with no issues so far.
2,super dim lights,"I bought them to use in my jack-o-lantern this year so to avoid any pumpkin fires, but they are so dim, even when you first turn them on, that I wound up having to put a few lights in every pumpkin. Not nearly as bright as a candle, and very finicky too, to actually turn on. I wouldn't buy them again, but I will use these until they die."
2,They hardly flicker... at all,"These lights barely flicker. In fact, it's not very noticeable at all. They also aren't very bright. I returned my order."
1,Awful,"Awful, awful, awful, awful.These were so bad I couldn't even wait to write my review. The horrendous, disgusting things are still warm on the cookie sheet.I am going to make my boyfriend eat one right now with the instruction that he has to describe the cookie in one sentence.Ha ha. He just spit his one bite back out and said, ""Bad.""What shameful waste of a stick of butter."
3,Does the job but...,"It does the job but this item is poorly built, loose and light leaks in from the back. If your looking for a cheap solution to prevent flare then this is a good choice."
2,Info is wrong,"I purchased this video thinking that Mathew Fox and Jared Leto were in it, as it stated on the desciption main page. Well the main page is wrong, not one actor listed ever appears. I must say though it was still an interesting watch!"
3,Unnecessary,"Don't waste your money. The point of a ""puzzle"" game is to solve the puzzles using your brainpower. Strategy guides in general are more helpful for strategy-style games (SimCity, etc). In this case, itis just giving you solutions.Besides, it's not really necessary. The Game is NOT that hard to play. Anybody who says you'd have to ""devote your life to it"" must not be trying very hard at all. I completed the game in a reasonable time span and still replay it from time to time."
3,Live--definately!,"As a whole, I don't really care for live albums. I am,however, starting to get into Psychic TV so I'm willing to give it more stars. Another plus is that I can actually tell what he's singing. So, basically, the audio and energy are the major selling points for this CD. ""Paint Box Black"" would have to be one of my favorites on this."
3,A little shaky,"Yes, it can take the smallest diameter arrows and it can get the job done, but the problem lies herein:1.) The arms (where the vanes or feathers are inserted) are made out of cheap plastic.2.) The screws that hold the arms to the machine are actually nails that are hammered into the plastic. When I received the item fresh from the safe and secure packaging, there was chipping on the arms.3.) The arms are very shaky so if you are using glue, chances are you are going to get it all over your arrow shaft when you close the machine to do its job.4.) The instructions are not as clear for a beginner so YouTube might be your friend.But it would be an injustice to say that the machine can't perform it's duty. The fact is, if you want to fletch vanes or feathers quickly without having to use a jig and do them one-by-one, then you can not go wrong. The price is a little steep but I don't see anything else on the market that comes close to this."
2,Good book,"The book itself was really good but I was not happy that a book in volving angels and God had sex in it. I am not a prude, I know that books have that kind of stuff in them I just didn't think it was appropriate for this book."
1,Last Witness,I agree with the past reviews that you must read the first book prior to this one. I for one was very disapointed after reading the first which was a must for all that love suspense. I never did finish this as I have many others to read that are much more enjoyable. I hope the next book is much better for this was beyond disapointing.
3,The sequel not as good as the first,"I read Retribution and could not put it down. When I learned the author had written a sequel, I immediately read it after finishing Retribution. For some reason, I wasn't as hooked with The Last Witness as I was with Retribution. I just couldn't figure out why. Then I realized that the author retold Retribution's plot, so I felt like I was re-reading it all over again. I'm not sure why this is: for those readers who started with The Last Witness first and didn't know there was a sequel? Who knows. I did finish it, however and thought it wrapped up too neatly. I could be wrong though bcuz after reading the last page, there will be a part 3. Despite not liking The Last Witness as much, I will read the 3rd book. After all I do want see what happens next with C.J., Dominick and Cupid."
1,Frustrated! Too Small!,"I was disappointed with the size of this doll, which is like 3"" tall. The ads do not tell you the size. I had originally bought for a 2 year old, Obviously she can't use it, because it has small parts. Ad didn't specify age range either."
1,Please don't buy!,"After having read the previous review i made the gamble and bought the book. Please don't make the same mistake. The book laks proffessionalism, instructions and originality. The book is a lousy collection of pictures of low grade food carvings, and gives no or minimal instructions on how to recreate them. if it was not for all the hassle and costs involved this book would have been returned on the same day as received!"
4,The Genius Of Robert E. Lee,"Being a lifelong Civil War buff, ""The Genius Of Robert E. Lee"" was a book I had to read and am glad I did!The title is around 340 pages and has 11 chapters that covers different eras of Lee's life:1. Early life and West Point years.2. Early army life.3. Mexican War experiences.4. Years leading up to the Civil War.5. Early Civil War years.6. Mid and later Civil War years.7. Post-Civil War years, especially as President of Washington and Lee College.Each of the 11 chapters contain several 1-2 page stories of various events in Lee's life, his response, and how we can learn from both his wisdom and mistakes. The lessons learned may be applied to the reader's home, family, business, and community.The narrative is smooth, flows freely, and may be completed in a few sittings.Read, enjoy, and whatever your opinion of Lee, your respect and admiration for the man will probably increase.Recommended."
1,Horrible item,"I ordered these for my 2 year old son. Within one hour of wearing the first pair, the grommetts on the front of the bibs ripped out of the fabric with no cause."
5,Video Transfer,Very easy to install on a Mac. Worked within minutes of unwrapping it. Get's the job done with ease. A very efficient way to transfer Analog Video to a DV format.
5,"Durable, Long-lasting, combat tested",I have owned this watch for 4 years and it is still going. I am only now having to replace the band. I wear it daily; work out with it; and I have taken it into combat three tours and now getting ready for another. This is a great watch and I recommend it to anyone who is active and/or rough on there stuff!
3,Good watch with a cheap strap,"I've owned my G2300 for about a year and love the functionality. It stores phone numbers (handier than you might think) and is solidly constructed. The battery gauge on the upper left-hand side of the screen hasn't gone down at all. Supposedly you have to replace the battery after 2 years, but if the gauge is any indicator I won't need to do this for a while. Water resistance seems good. I don't dive, so I can't write about lower depths.My only gripe is that the strap, while well designed, started to crack almost immediately. It's still holding together but probably not for much longer. But if I only have to replace the strap every once in a while instead of the entire watch (like you do with cheaper watches), I'm a happy camper."
1,Gshock Display out after 5 months,"This watch worked well for about five months then the display went out. I have had many watches and even the $6.00 disposable watches lasted longer than this watch has at one tenth the price.The support and feedback page on the Casio web site is not very user friendly including an acknowledgment disclaimer on repairs that reads like the customer is trying to rip off Casio by getting their repair or warranty work done.I am not impressed by either the watch or the customer service displayed at the web site. I cannot give a good rating to either the watch or the online service. The hours for calling customer service are convenient for the service center, but not for customers who have jobs, but I will try to call them and hope I am not wasting more of my time."
5,Great Light for the money.,The light arrived on time and as advertised. At the price I bought two of them and they worked great. I used them for boresighting my rifles and they light up the bore like daylight.it is small enough to lay in the breach. The magnet is great and I stick it under the shelf of my work bench to make it easy to find. I didn't know that it even came with a magnet so it was an added touch to an already good light. The laser is cool and it drives our cat crazy. All in all it was a good buy and my grandson has already claimed the spare one. (I bought 2 at that price.) Next time I will have to order more for the rest of my grandsons.Sgt J in Julian`
5,The Excellent book,This book is the best for all pocket pc users. It is clear easy and fuctional. In one word it is the best.
4,Cute soft box,"Very cute box. It is made out of cloth material. It is small not really a lunch box but big enough for a child to carry small toys. (mine will most likely put her pet shops or Tinkerbell toys) It did come with three DVDs which I was nervous about after seeing the size of the bag but the DVDs run from 1hr to an 1hr and a half. Overall it is a cute box (bag) whichever, but my 5yr old will be pleased."
2,It's got a full length tail,"We purchased this figurine thinking it was a good representation of the Australian Shepherd? ..but, without a bobbed tail and with the poor paint detail, ...it is not!"
5,Love this book,This is of course a modern version of the Count of Monte Cristo.I read this book and loved it and then I attempted the original.I quit reading the original after a few chapters. The language was out of date and the story was difficult to follow with the orginal character names.But this book is great. Love the straight forward style.
2,"distracting, but not really good","Other reviewers have eloquently described this book. And it is not unpleasant reading--it is distracting and mildly entertaining. It won't keep you up all night finishing it.I just want to re-iterate that the acquisition of limitless wealth, the change of identity and appearance, and the various revenges taken, strain the credibility way too far. The last part of the book is all juvenile fantasy wish fulfillment, and made me uncomfortably embarrassed for the author, who I have to presume took the fantasy wishes from his own collection. Sure, we all have these fantasies, but if I'm going to read about someone else's, I'd like them described a little more artfully."
4,Macromedia Dreamweaver MX 2004 Hands-On Training,"Good price, quick delivery, and brand new. All positive feedback. The only slightly negative thing is one of the corners of the book was damaged, but the book is fully usable."
5,Dreamweaver,"This book is fantastic, if you've never used this program before, this is the book for you."
2,Author's tone is very annoying & condescending,I was annoyed most of the time while reading this book. The writer TELLS you what you have experienced and felt growing up as oppose to saying what you may have experienced. She also TELLS you how you are and what you feel. If she had been on the mark it may have made me feel comfortable - like hey she knows me and what I am going through. But it was way off so I found myself annoyed. It may have been that her clients and the people she worked with during her research may have come from a very narrow focus group.However I did give her 2 stars because some of the information is useful whether you are an adult child of an alcoholic or not.
5,Adult Children of Alcoholics,"My counselor gave me this book to read and it's been the best material I have come across so far. I have identified with so many things in this book and see certain traits in myself that have been written in the book. I am finally able to recognize some of my traits and patterns and am aware of the changes I need to make in order to hopefully have healthy relationships in the future. I recommend this book to anyone who is delving into the Adult Child area. I don't remember a lot of my childhood, but through the help of this book, I am able to see a lot of things that I missed out on and how those little things have impacted me throughout life thus far. I will carry this book with me everywhere for quite some time probably and refer to it often."
2,unanswered ways to code IO classes,"Being unfamiliar with computers, I found looking for some example listings involving reading/writing files lacking. I wanted to: 1. read in a text file from disk D (not disk C), 2. read in one record at a time into a buffer, 3. parse that data into words, 4. examine the words to determine which arrays to put them in, 5. process the data, 6. output results to the console and/or to another file.Instead of writing all the steps above in the MAIN class, I want to only code step 1 and/or step 2 in the MAIN. From the MAIN class call the remaining steps with the option to call step from one step to the other steps or to new classes.I need some type of templates for the above. I don't know how to obtain API programs or a list describing each one. I don't know step by step how to assign a PATH to call javac and java from JAVA."
1,Yep you have heard this more than once from me-guess I will never be a Java Programmer huh.,Very disappointing for me. I really was expecting an interesting read but I got bored so very quickly and gave up and stashed away before finishing.
5,"Pick up the book, you wont regret it!","Excellent book, if you are just learning Java are new to Java, Barry takes you step by step through the chapters, he really makes it a fun and exciting read. Pick up the book! You wont regret it."
3,Good Introductory Text for Java Programming,"The Beginning Programing with Java title in the Dummies series gives a short introduction to some of the fundamental aspects of not only Java, but object-oriented programming. If you are seeking an efficient introduction to Java programming, this book will help you get started, but this book alone is not enough to have a complete understanding of the Java programing language, even at the beginner level."
1,Don't waste your money,"I've purchased this charger kit to use with my digital camera. As far as that goes, it was absolutely futile. The batteries simply drain too quickly. I made sure there was enough time to charge (at least 2 hours) and one time I had it charging for 2 days straight. The thing is, as soon as you take the batteries out of the charger, they start to drain. I've read a lot of positive reviews on this thing, that is why I bought it, but I must say my personal experience coincides more with the reviewers who gave this product a 1 star: in other words, a complete waste of money."
1,Wasted Money,"Four AA batteries come with the charger. After charging the batteries, I inserted two of them into my camera. After 5 minutes of use, my camera indicated that the batteries needed recharging. I removed them and inserted the other two. They worked for two pictures. I stored the camera and tried to used it a few days later only to find that it would not come on. I inserted the first two batteries that had been recharged. They seemed to work for the few minutes that I used it at that time. A week or two later, I tried to turn on my camera and they were dead. The bottom line is that the batteries are worthless or the charger doesn't fully charge the batteries. Since I do not use my camera for weeks at a time, I did not realize this until after the 30-day return period had passed. My choice now is to purchase rechargable batteries and hope that the issue was the batteries and not the charger."
3,Use With Caution,"It may seem an odd thing to say about a book whose hallmark is prudence, but this volume is dangerous. The general principles it inculcates are fine but be very wary of following its more specific recommendations such as avoiding a stock if its price/book ratio is greater than 2. Under current conditions you would end up with an odd, unbalanced portfolio. The basic premise of this book, that Mr. Graham could reduce his complex discipline of value investing to rules of thumb simple enough for individuals to follow, may just be a mistake."
5,Buffett's most favorite investment book,"Buffett consider this book the best ever written about investment. He wrote the preface for the book. In the preface, he said if we learn two things from the book, first take advantage of Mr. Market (As stock market prices go up and down, we should buy good company stocks with good discounts, and sell to take profits when prices gone too high) and second have Margin of Safety (One should only buy a stock with significant discount to have room for ones valuation error on the stock), he or she should do well in the stock market."
5,The Intelligent Investor by Benjamin Graham,"I have not read the book yet, but if Warren Buffett recommends it, that's good enough for me. I can say that the hard-bound copy arrived in perfect condition, including the paper book cover, and the price was right."
3,Good fundamental in investing,"I found this book good for providing a good fundamentals in investing. It is a good starting point for anyone in investing. Shows the importance of looking at history and how the portfolio needs to be balanced at any point of time ""Diversification"" in terms of stocks/bonds.However, many times I found it a bit dry and uninteresting since it goes into details on topics without lively examples, put you to sleep... :)"
5,Intelligent Investor,"This is a replacement in my personal library and I know there might be a more recent version, so some of the information contained might be dated. I wanted the original. Book is in good condition and was shipped quickly."
3,Cozy mystery with great backdrop but unbelievable character,"The unlikely setting of a Virginia vineyard and an amateur sleuth with a badly-damaged leg form the backdrop for a potentially intriguing and entertaining cozy mystery. But the author can't seem to decide if the heroine, Lucie Montgomery, is a frail, young woman needing help with the smallest tasks-- or superhuman, as she's depicted when she takes on the enemy. Though the story kept my interest, the main character is, at best, inconsistent and, at worst, wholly unbelievable."
3,Wine country Mystery,This book is deep with history and wine. The action is a bit meladramatic and predictable. The main character seems like a bit of a push over and her brother is a jerk.
4,cute tea kettle,"I didn't pay enough attention to the detail ""1.2 Quart"". This tea kettle is VERY small! But I like it, and use it daily. I do wish it was a bit bigger, though. This is a quality item and is well made. It should last me for years."
1,Canon USB cable IFC-400 PCU,When you receive this product it is NOT what is pictured or described!!! It will not fix my canon camera... and should not be sold on Amazon... I am sorry that I chose Amazon to order from... next time I will just use Canon.
4,Great product,"Great product, great price, ontime, that was easy... wonderful! I would recommend it to anyone wanting to even hook together their Hard Disks."
1,not as advertised,"I did not get what was advertised. Yes it was cheap, but not what I ordered. When I emailed the company to complain, they sent me to a link on amazon that corrected ""their"" item as what they sent me. Who looks at the different company ads when buying the advertised items on amazon??? As my daughter would say, not freaking cool. I will make sure that I never buy from this company again.Canon USB Cable IFC-400PCU for Canon Cameras & Camcorders"
4,Basic USB Cable--works fine.,"No, it doesn't look exactly like the picture, like others noted. But it works fine and I got it in two days. Very satisfied."
1,Piece of plastic junk,This fan is at Walmart for 29.97 and on sale for 20.00 even. I bought one brand new and it does not move nearly as much air as a ten dollar box fan. Even worse the fans both touch the plastic housing and make a very obnoxious clicking noise when running. Honeywell this is a piece of junk you should be ashamed to put your name on it.
5,A Definitive Life of James Baldwin,"Both telling about his writing and intimately even-handed about his life, this biography of James Baldwin is by turns heartening and harrowing. Baldwin kept faith with his vocation despite the tumultuous period in which he lived and wrote. David Leeming, who knew Baldwin throughout his career, has given us a great American life in the round."
2,"Baldwin fan? Read this for the info., not the writing.","I haven't read many biographies, but I have read lots of Baldwin -- both essays and novels. I came away from this book wishing that it was as compelling as its subject -- that Leeming had contributed his insights to the efforts of a writer closer to Baldwin's caliber -- and that the book had the benefit of a better editor. There is a sense that perhaps Leeming reveres Baldwin a bit too much. It's hard to communicate a true sense of intimacy with your subject when he's so high up on a pedestal! Overall, a disappointment."
4,Discover Washington With Kids,This book is indispensable if you want to have fun with your family! There are so many things to do in our own backyard that we aren't aware of and the authors have included just about everything!
3,I was expecting more.,"I bought this CD in the hopes of making meditation easier. It did not help my mediation sessions at all. I couldn't concentrate while listening to it. As other reviewers state it sounds dark and sinister, but that's actually what I liked about it. When I sleep I need total silence and darkness, but I found out that this is the only CD I can listen to that will actually help me go to sleep. If you buy it for meditation and it doesn't work you can also try it as a sleep aid."
4,Sooooothing,"After Theta meditation, the Gamma meditation system is the next step to take you even deeper. One of my favourites."
2,Too Bombastic,"Linda Eder has lots of power in her voice. She uses it to the fullest in her attempt at trying to copy Streisand. She should try singing instead of screaming. She is Bombastic all the way through, and needs to work on some smoother vocal shades. I don't like this album, hope for a better one later."
1,Ugh!,"Linda Eder is the most over rated singer around today. If her husband wasn't connected to Atlantic Records she would have never gotten this many record contracts. You hear one track, you've heard them all. Will she ever come out with anything really original?"
5,heart and soul,"This is by far Linda's best CD. She pours her heart and soul into each song. Her voice is at its very best here, the songs are thoughtfully chosen, and the arrangements are warm and rich. I'm a huge Linda Eder fan and love all of her work, but this is my favorite. I can't listen to it enough. You won't be disappointed with this album."
5,Amazing new cd!,"Linda Eder's voice is gorgeous and powerful, and this new cd has stunning renditions of some of Broadway's most amazing songs. I find myself humming this music constantly. You can't go wrong buying this cd - you'll become an instant fan!"
2,The Critics Call it right - Lower Marks for Miss Eder,"I have followed this girls career with interest over the years. I have been eagerly awaiting this Broadway CD. I'm sorry to say that for once I agree with the Amazon Critic and the New York paper. Miss Eder shows a keen lack of style and does ""roar"" through the entire album. Her song list is very poor,and I really don't like anyone messing with the old standard Edelweiss.So on one album, we have Miss Eder trying to copy Barbra,(Don'tRain On My Parade)Liza,(Some People) and Enya styled Edelweiss.Goodness Gracious, what has happened to her? I had such high hopes for her. I give her 2 stars, because I don't want to be mean, but for goodness sakes, please on the next album, give ussomething new in your own style with some pretty nuances."
1,"Impossible Dream , You Betcha","Impossible Dream to say the least...Linda Eder's diction & tempo on Barbra's ""Don't Rain on My Parade"" leaves something to be desired. If it was Ms Eder's intention to top Barbra she misses the mark altogether. The rendition of Edelweiss breaks the heart of anyone who's ever seen The Sound of Music there's no feeling or emotion in Ms Eder's voice as there was in the movie. All the ballads on the album have been done and redone so many times that they sounded old & tired. Ms Eder didn't seem to have anything new to add to them. I would say all in all this is a very boring album. If I want to hear Broadway I'll listen to Barbra. I thought maybe Ms Eder would have something new to add to these songs, but apparently I was wrong. Ms Eder fans...will be disappointed with this...bottom line don't waste your money."
4,"Good instructional book, so long as there is instruction","This book comes with a CD that has Jim Snidero playing all of the music. I originally used this book to learn how to stylize my jazz playing by playing along with the recordings. The tunes are mostly standards (or all). It is definitely a good starting point for the beginning improviser, how to learn to play a lead part, or to just have fun!I think that after a while, however, this book becomes quite redundant, especially if a beginning student is using it alone, without private instruction. This book can be a great tool for many things, but has no instruction (for the most part). More than anything, this book is great method for private lessons."
5,Chick Flick,Of all chick flicks this was possibly the easiest to watch for a guy. Maybe because James Bond was in it.
5,Excellent way to tame quinoa,"Quinoa is an astonishing grain. It contains a range of proteins as interesting and as complete as milk, and it grows perfectly in Quebec my province where nights are rather cold in summer. I ordered this book few months ago along with many others with the hope to find recipes for my mother who cannot eat solid food (she has a stomach cancer). In a matter of fact, I was looking for a-meal-in-a-soup style recipes something like those we can find in France Moore Lappé ""Diet for a Small Planet"". Maria Baez Kijac's book is thin but contains at least five recipes of healthy soups that my mother loves, much more than heavier and more expensive books. This book gives also the reader a sense for adapting his own recipes with quinoa. Since I have got ""The Art of Cooking with Quinoa"", I use rice less and less.Merci beaucoup Madame Maria Baez Kijac : )"
2,Don't know beans about barbeque,"The author of this book obviously doesn't know much about barbeque, or much about beans either. It is amazing how he gives high marks to some places, like chain barbeques, that have very substandard fare, and doesn't even mention real barbeque places with good food right down the road from them. The reviews of barbeque joints in this book are not to be trusted by serious barbeque lovers."
4,Short and concise,"Good review of the history of stop motion and a great introdutction into making stop motion movies, though not too deep. Some explanations are rather short and not everything is explained. Good price and quality."
2,HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!,"This CD is just a PATHETIC attempt at Hatebreed's style! And they dare compare these losers to OPETH AND MUDVAYNE?!?!?!?! HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!! I agree with ""Mike Smith"", the other reviewer who apparently had my same reaction. Opeth and Mudvayne demonstrate passion, talent, and superiority to the rest of the music world. Grade 8 is just another nu-metal band. HOW COULD THIS EDITOR COMPARE OPETH TO GRADE 8????? I can't be the only one out there who thinks this editor deserves to be fired for that idiodic statement. WHAT A MORON!!! Anyways.... yea. Opeth and Mudvayne = Talent. Grade 8 = just another dud in the scores and scores of nu-metal bands. DON'T BUY. IT'S WORSE THAN LIMP BIZKIT! Well maybe that was a little extreme... but it's not much better."
3,Where's the score?,"Where's the rest of the score? They only took a few minor tracks from Randy Edelman's score and put them in almost as an afterthought. This kinda irks me because I buy soundtracks for the scores, not the other music. While I enjoyed all the songs on the soundtrack, there's still more room on a CD for more of the score, especially music from the fight scenes."
4,Sore toes!,"Only reason I did not give 5 stars is that it makes it difficult to re-make the bed, and causes the sheets to either become trapped or pull away. If pulled away, you have no cover from your cold toes; If trapped, the sheets may rip. Just a bit of an inconvenience I may have expected had I given it more thought."
4,very useful,My daughter loves this. The joints are on a kind of spring mechanism so they do not necessarily hold the exact pose to the degree you may want but it is just a general human shape for a drawing aid as I see it. Very sturdy.
5,Best product EVER!,This is a must have for every woman. When you wake up during the night and your head feels like it might burst into flames the comfort cushion will cool your down instantly. I would like to have my whole bed made out of this stuff!
3,Does its Job!!,"Stays cool mostly in an air conditioned room. If you put it in the frig. as they state, It gets too hard and uncomfortable. Even if you don't put it in the frig.,it still is somewhat stiff and needs getting used to."
4,This book definitely helped me get a 5 on my AP test.,This book was great. I followed the schedule they provided in the book to study for the test and my score came out wonderful. Getting a 5 on an AP test is very difficult but this book will help out.
4,Macromedia Flash MX-HOT,Good tutorial style book for beginners. Learn Flash step by step. the only downfall was I couldn't use it as a reference and just pick it up and look how to do something unless I did the exercise.
3,almost too basic,"I bought this book having some knowledge of Flash. This book is almost too basic. If you have some knowledge of Flash and are comfortable with making basic pages, then this book may not be what you are looking for. If you have no experience using Flash and are truly a newbie, this is the book for you.It is well laid out and easy to use. The index is great and makes things very easy to find. But definitely would not recommend this book for those with basic knowledge of this program.I would probably go with ""Beyond the Basics"" or something else if you have some knowledge -- even minimal."
3,Not Quite As In Depth As I Wanted,This is interesting if you just want to learn the basics. There are few practical applications of flash in this book. If you can get past this you will realize this book is well written and an excellent guide for the beginner of Flash MX 2004.
5,Wonderful Music for Children of All Ages,We love Tom Knight's music. This cd is full of fun and silly songs that you and your kids will love listening to over and over and over again. My personal favorites are Caterpillar Dance and The Juggler. My kids who are almost 2 yrs and almost 5 yrs old just love Tom Knight's music.
1,Repetitious recording,"I had great hopes for this CD, given that it claimed to present over an hour of continuous rain recording without additional sounds. Unfortunately, for the discerning ear, it is clear the company has recorded only about 60 seconds worth of rainfall, then repeats this same track continuously throughout the CD (staggering the track occasionally). Perhaps this won't matter to some, but I was disappointed."
3,A downward departure,"I thought this CD was a significant downward departure in quality compared to his earlier work. Don't get me wrong--I'm a big Rovics fan--but this CD is just missing something. I appreciate that he is trying to branch out musically but, for me, it just doen't work. As always, I appreciate the politics, but the music just isn't there."
4,Perfect for what I needed,"My son-in-law is a firefighter. I needed these to replace the frayed cuffs on his favorite issued, but discontinued, work sweatshirt. They worked perfectly and he is happy to get more wear out of his favorite pull-over. It is faded blue and the navy cuffs looked just fine on it. I will give them 5 stars when I see how long they hold up."
2,Cheap Looking Burner Covers,I am not happy with these burner covers. They are very thin and buckle up on the sides.
2,Broken!!,Box was completely covered in masking tape due to the damage from travel. To my dismay the table was broken as well.. obviously not the companies fault but very unfortunate and a pain in my ass. I will be returning the product.
3,Boring narrator,"Even though I really dislike the new narrator, my 3 year old loves these stories and the new characters. I disagree with other reviewers who think the new narrator gives different voices to all the characters. To me they all sound the same...boring and monotonous. This DVD wasnt for me, but for my son and as long as he's happy...I'm happy."
3,A good start but not a tell all for meditation,"This Dummies book is a good start for anyone interested in meditation for any reason. The strength of this book is that it is non-denominational. While the author does cast light on the importance of meditation in all of the world's religions, he does not advocate any one religious mediation over the others. The meditation taught in this book is non-religious meditation emphazising the use of meditation for all people. The weakness of the book is that the author seems to be overly enthusiastic about the yoga/tantra/spritual type of meditation and doesn't cover other types of meditation as well as it might. For anyone interested in learning meditation this is a good starting place to pick up your basic technique but futher study will be needed.-MB"
3,Just not for me,I like the Dummies books but this one just wasn't for me. I could not get through the first chapter.....just keep putting me to sleep. I sure it is a good book and others have enjoyed reading it. I have to pass on this one.
3,Interesting stories from an experienced ghost hunter.,"I have read other Hans Holser books and I respect this author. This volume was terribly edited in many, many places and the quality of the writing was erratic. It was as if his writings were all gathered together over the years and published in this extensive book. The terrible editing to which I refer is the Kindle version. I think I would go to a B and M store and look at a hard back or trade volume. I would guess it is about 1000 pages. I preferred his scientific portions over the ""ghost stories"" This one is overpriced for the quality of the editing. I really should be redone!"
4,"Kinda strange, but the second Everien book rocks!","Ok. All of you avid fanasty book readers, this book is quite different. I picked it up on the local used book store shelf and read it. I liked it but not quite as much as Raymond Feist's Serpent War Saga. But then I read the second one (The Riddled Night) more or less because I needed something to read and I knew the author was a pretty good writer. The Riddled Night was awesome! I was spellbound and read it in less than a week (quite a feat when you have Debate Team, Model UN, Math Team and Beta Club). If you love fanasty, YOU MUST READ THIS BOOK. It is essential to understand the second. It will not be a waste of your time or money!"
2,"Confused, but engaging enough to finish","Although Valery Leith shows promise in this debut, her ideas never quite gel. There is no question she has a vivid imagination, but it tends to overwhelm the narrative. Reading it, one can follow the story in a general way, but to explain what actually happens in any given situation and why is a challenge. It's all quite random. The characters, with one or two exceptions, are poorly developed--and their motivations are no clearer than the story. Leith revels in the fantastical, but seems to care little that her rather turgid vision makes no sense. Perhaps in the subsequent volumes, her universe comes into greater focus, but I, for one, am not motivated to give them a shot."
4,Make you think that your siblings are precious.,"Good book. Could do a little bit more better. Jessica and Elizabeth are always fighting, that's true. Their mother admit that she and her sisters never fight, even once ! But on Thanksgiving Day, everything changes. Jessica and Elizabeth's aunts and cousins come to Sweet Valley to celebrate the big day. Somebody wake up early in the morning to do the stuffing. Some changes in the family history. It also changes the 'harmony' family who never quarrels. They conduct a war on a day which suppose to be happy and loving. Who stop it ? Jessica ? Elizabeth ? One of their cousins ? You'll just have to read it."
4,great for curly or wavy hair,"This is useful for wavy or curly hair - less frizz, more curl. also great after swimming in chlorinated pools."
4,Good but nonstandard screw.,"Screw is 3/8 vs 1/4 in my stand, so I had to drill th hole bigger. Even doing that, tbe peg holds my clarinet very safely."
3,Flimsy construction,I agree with the other reviewer that noted this filter is somewhat flimsy in its construction. The rubber seal around the edge looks like it could pretty easily fall off. The only reason I didn't give it fewer stars is because the OEM filter it is replacing was also pretty flimsy.
4,culture collision,"Producers and writers Peter Brosens and Jessica Hope Woodworth combine bleak realism and artistic surrealism in this film set on the frigid Mongolian steppe. The teenager Bagi and his family are nomadic herders who are forcibly relocated by the government under the ruse of a plague. They are resettled in a grimy mining town where monster machines gash coal from the earth, dilapidated high rises loom out of the barren landscape, and steamy smoke belches from every chimney. As a youngster on the Mongolian steppe, Bagi had seizures. A shamaness in the desert interpreted this as a spiritual gift; in the government hospital, doctors in white coats called it epilepsy. In Bagi's clairvoyance and premonitions, time, space and relations get rearranged in a collision of worldviews that is both literal and deeply figurative. Khadak has earned awards from Sundance, Venice, and Toronto film festivals. In Mongolian with English subtitles."
3,"Smells good, no flea effect","This smells like baby powder and makes my skin soft. Unfortunately I was trying it for the off-label use as insect repellent and it didn't work. Since it is an oil, of course it didn't soak in immediately."
3,Well written,"Well I may feel a little inclined to write a good review about this book being that Brian is a real good friend of mine, but the fact is that this is a great book no matter who wrote it. Well done."
5,Prepare to be Scared,"One of the first and best murder mystery authors of all time is brought out in these wonderful pieces of art. To think of the demons and struggles this man went through in his life and to be able to get them on paper, just makes them more realistic and scary. Edgar A. Poe, as he liked to call himself, needs to be read and interpreted in a group setting. Therefore, you are able to bounce all the different little aspects of the story or poem off one another. Some may say that all the foreshadowing and little pieces of clues he gives you are coincidence. That is for you to determine.When reading these pieces of work, be sure to pay attention and take in all he gives you. You are guaranteed to miss lots of hints in your first reading. Which means you need to read many many times. Each time you are given a different perspective and find those little hints. But in the end, readers will never really know what Edgar A. Poe was feeling or thinking while writing these masterpieces."
4,Content Great - Quality Not!,"I loved this show as a kid and it's still great! The tendency of the DVD to freeze and skip is it's downfall. I returned the first copy, was sent a replacement and then received another copy as a gift. I kept the second and third copies - between them I have all the episodes intact. It certainly sours me to purchasing a Universal product, though."
2,Quality Control Problems,"Unfortunately Episode 5 on Disc 1 Side A will not play on any of the 3 DVD players I own. Why is Universal so terrible with releasing great TV series to DVD? Poor quality control, no extras, no commentary, and all for full price. I think I know why...In reading the description of Adam 12 on the DVD cover I wonder if Universal's product people have seen even one episode, or at least had a discussion with a fan. Where is the mention of Adam 12's accuracy to detail, the quality of its stories, its proud Dragnet lineage, its decades of global syndication? Instead, we should watch ""the brothers in blue struggle to manage the job's demands."" All around very weak treatment of this excellent show. At the very least is it too much trouble, Universal, to provide working DVDs to your customers?"
1,???????,"I just saw on Amizon ""UK"" that this movie is being releast on BLU-RAY 10 Oct,2011 for 12 pounds. So,what's with this high price for the DVD? We need to get something started with whom ever is responsible for this movie in the U.S. The one star is for holding the price so high."
3,"Good for a film version of a Classic TV series, but no cigar","My memories as a schoolboy watching on mediocre reception of the BBC signal of the 30 minute episodes of Quatermass are inescapable. This movie version is passable, but only passable, to those of us who were enthralled, and terrified, by the black and white drama of the original.I hope that somewhere in the achives of the BBC there are recordings of the original series. Their release on DVD would be a meaningful event.This movie is an worthy attempt, but for those of us who remember the original, and its cultural ambiance, it will forever fall short."
3,Leaping! Hopping! Skinning up!,"Now hang on a minute, Nige. Here you say the human race is basically a bunch of genetically modified Martians. Later in the 'Quatermass Conclusion' you say humans have been planted here to be harvested as musque for aliens. Now which is it, eh? We're up to our ears in aliens (leaping, hopping! Etc) Is there anyone out there carrying a credit card who is actually indigenous to our own planet? Personally, I think I'm British through and through, and one sniff under my armpits tells me I'm no Eau de Plonk for anyone.Now, why does that guy climb up that crane in the climatic scene? You can't operate it from up there, son. Still, it all worked out fine in the end, eh?"
5,Excellent range bag,Finally one with enough room for all my stuff and my magazines! It would be nice if the beverage holder was large enough to fit a bottle of water. Seems to only fit beer bottles (what are they implying?!? lol) But overall it's an excellent range bag and it's great for long pistols and lots of equipment.
1,Help for another customer,"The song in the promo is ""Don't Dream its Over"" covered by Sixpence None the Richer and is available on the Smallville soundtrack. The song was originally recorded by a great 80's band called Crowded House."
4,Amazon Critics Suck,All of the songs on this CD are great but the Amazon reviewer made the stupidest remark about Chantal - she had the most moving songs here and is truly a hidden star.
3,to A music fan from NY,"I wanted to find the same song...just to let you know, it's Don't dream its over by sixpence none the richer."
3,song in the promo: crowded house song: must have it,"song in the promo is ""don't dream it's over"" (hey now hey now) by crowded house, an excellent band from australia. buy all their cd's, they are great. i do not know who the singer is in the promo but i like it and i must have it. it sounds similar to emmie who covered bryan ferry's roxy music: more than this. any one else please help. by the way i am looking for a girl singer similar to this: opportunities abound, structure is available. i play, you sing, we record/perform."
2,Great song!,"This is for the person wondering who sings the song in the promo. If it's the song that goes ""hey now, hey now"" then it's Sixpence None The Richer. It's called ""Don't Dream It's Over"". I actually don't believe this song is on the soundtrack, unfortunately. But usually the main promo song never makes the soundtrack for some reason. I still remember ""Crush"" by Jennifer Paige being the main promo song for ""Simply Irresistible"" yet that song was not on the soundtrack. I know I've gone on too long and this review is only help to that one person, probably."
2,Sixpence song,"The Sixpence None the Richer song heard in the promo is ""Don't Dream It's Over"", a cover version of the classic by Crowded House. Strangely enough, this song is NOT, repeat NOT, on the soundtrack; they used ""Kiss Me"" instead. ""Don't Dream It's Over"" can be found on the Sixpence album titled ""Divine Discontent"" and the original version is found on the self-titled album ""Crowded House""."
3,The Sixpence None The Richer Song,"Hi all!! I wanted to let you know that the Sixpence None the Richer Song ""Don't dream it's over"" is on the Smallville soundtrack!!"
3,A Bit of a Drag,"I didn't have trouble continuing to read this to the finish, but I thought it dragged on and on. I would, however read other works by the same author."
3,Disappointing,"I love true ghost stories, but this wasn't one of my favorites. The writing style is clunky, with too much information unrelated to ghosts and hauntings included. There are a few good stories, but they're lost in the clutter. Many of the ""haunted happenings"" are just uneasy feelings about a place, which doesn't make for compelling reading.As for the photos...one of them is quite striking. The rest are just routine photos of places and buildings, or supposed ""ghost"" photos in which I can't see anything unusual."
4,Kayak Bendables,The Kayak bendables that I got are a lot of fun. Wasn't looking for education out of them- just some reminders about kayaking for my office at work. I love them.
1,Not worth the Call,"This game is by far the worst first person shooter I have ever played. The graphics are mediocre at best and the handling is horrific. Being able to shoot is like trying to shot an peanut with a spitball from 50 feet away. The storyline is all over the place and doesnt amount to anything else I have ever played.In all, this game wasnt worth what I paid for it."
4,Sturdier than the competish,"I bought this because I learned that Blitz products were failing me over and over. I'm impressed at the threading for the small cap - it's like thick, cast plastic. The cap screws on tight and feels like it will last.It's also nice that the handle for carrying this is on the same end as the cap for pouring. You can trust that this won't spill while carrying it.My only complaint is how small the funnel is. Some cars spill oil over a large area when removing the oil filter. It could be a challenge to catch all that oil with the funnel that comes with this oil pan.However, this seems like a much higher-quality product than the likes I've had from Blitz."
4,Works well but Wish I had bought the larger capacity,The funnel is large enough to catch most splashes and has a grid to prevent the plug from going through. Being able to close it up and take the oil directly to the recycler is very handy but I wish that I had purchased the larger version so that I could change the oil in both cars without having to dump in between. Construction seems solid.
5,Well rounded,"I do not change the oil in my car(s). I do, however, change the oil in all the lawn and snow equipment I have. So I didn't need or want any of those very large containers that seem to dominate this part of the market. This was one of the few smaller pans/storage container that looked promising and I have no regrets from having purchased it. The funnel screws on securely to the pan and it has ""ribs"" to help with transferring other containers into this one very easily (in case you drain something into a metal can, for example, and then pour the metal can into this container. When not in use, the funnel stores nicely in a cavity on the face of the container (as shown in the picture) so I don't have to worry about losing it. It stands up on end when in storage mode so it doesn't take up much garage space. And I've had no problems with the cap leaking so overall it does everything I was hoping for."
5,Perfect Scale,"This scale is perfect for any kitchen, big or small. It is very useful and accurate. This purchase was very much worth the money. Enjoy!!"
5,David Llewellyn,I actually ordered this CD by accident...and found that it was my very favorite CD of the year! I can't believe it. He's very very good and I wish he had done anything else...I would buy it in a heartbeat.
4,A very good mp3 player,"Doesn't get five stars because of the lack of radio and it I'd like it to have come with something I could put it in to go jogging. That being said. Its an excellent mp3 player small but with a AA battery instead of AAA. Excellent long playing time. No major problems in over 2 years of usage. One thing though it has a complex (to me) folder system for compartmentalizing. So you don't have to read the manual to use it but, you may have to in order to get 100% out of it. Still an excellent buy."
4,Understanding Musashi,"I first read the Musashi novel (by Eiji Yoshikawa) 15 years ago and up to now I have read it three times. When I first came accross this book, I was quite interested to read it as it would be good companion book to learn more about Musashi's life. I was sort of expecting that this book would provide more information about Musashi. And it did. The book is very well written and very clear. A lot of aspects instantly clicked to the stages described in the novel.If you have previous interest in Musashi, I recommend this book. But if this is your first time to read about Musashi, I would recommend you to read the novel firs."
5,Great Deal,This camera kit was a great in that it included everything needed for the beginning shooter.
1,Bad Customer Service = Bad Experience,"I placed my order, got my confirmation, and the next day received a message that their inventory was off and there was no stock for this item, so my order was cancelled. Their inability to keep count of their stock is not my problem and they should have honored my order and filled it with individual components in order to make up the package they were offering. This is a good example of BAD customer service and consequently, I will never order from them again."
4,Purchased for wedding,"I purchased these stockings for my wedding in July. The shipping was fast, the price reasonable, and the stockings so sweet and lovely! The wedding bells add a nice touch - they even have a little rhinestone in them. It was perfect for helping me feel special on my wedding day - and night. The only negative thing about them was that I don't think they would hold up for very many uses. After a full day and night of wedding ceremony, reception, and dancing, they are a tad bit worn. Seeing as I only needed them for one day, and the low price, it was not a big deal for me at all. I would definitely recommend to the brides-to-be out there! Just make sure you have something to help hold them up - otherwise you might have a bit of a problem halfway through the evening."
5,Nostalgia,"Got this for my daughter, who grew up watching this show. We both really like rewatching the series. It is a little dated now but, still very enjoyable. It is a keepsake from her childhood."
4,It's about time!,"How fun it is to relive TV from the 70's! Boy did this bring back memories and the show is still as fresh and enjoyable as I remember it. It certainly did set the stage for later medical shows, especially ""ER"". The quality of the DVD's are excellent and it's great to watch it without commercials (though 1970's era commercials would be a hoot!) The only bad thing is there's no extra material on this set...WAAAAHHH! What about behind the scenes, or the making of, or out-takes? The only other disappointment is season 1 was only 1/2 a season and future season releases aren't out yet...I want them all!!!"
5,Loved this show growing up,I was only 3 when the show first came on but I remeber the later first run shows. I also watched the cartoon. I watched it when it when into syndication as it made for great Sunday afternoon TV and was thrilled when it was running on TVLand. I'm glad Universal is releasing it to DVD. It's amazing to see how much emergency medicine had advanced since this show aired.
5,Only 11 Episodes?,"In reading through the reviews I have noticed that a few of you are upset because there are only 11 episodes in this DVD set. The show was a mid-season replacement that debuted in January 1972, so there aren't any more episodes in season one.Also, the running time for the set is a few minutes shy of 11 hours. take a look at a DVD set for the Simpsons or some other modern series and you will discover that the 22 episodes for a season are only 7 hours or so long and sell for about the same price. Even better, take a look at the Sopranos or other HBO series and you will see that their 10-12 episode season will cost you $80 or more.As to the series itself, even after 30+ years it still amazes me how realistic everything looked. They didn't have all the computer generated special effects that make up today's TV shows and movies. they used real fires and rescues in a controlled environment, at least as well as you can control a fire."
3,Print is hard to read,"I wish I had paid more attention to the other reviews that said the print was most difficult to read....they were so right. I wonder who decided that orange was a good color for the print in a cookbook..for any book for that matter. In this book the ingredients are in a pale orange and the black, or is it green, print is not sharp at all.I can't judge the cookbook because I took one look and had so much trouble reading the print, that I have never made any of the recipes. It is not really fair of me to rate the cookbook with one star because it is actually the poor choice of ink color that I am rating, but I have no other choice if I want to give my opinion of the print"
4,Excellent,"This cookbook helped me fall in love with my rice cooker. The book is very comprehensive; history of rice, types of rice etc. I have made 7 of the recipes so far and they have all been great. The only negative is that the recipes need a little more salt/ seasonings thn the book uses. I recommend this book, it is particularly great for week night cooking."
2,F for type design!,What genius came up with the idea of using light orange type on a pale orange background? Or light green type on beige paper? Tasteful and completely useless. This cookbook may be very good. Or not. I don't think I will ever know. Reading it in the kitchen would necessitate a flashlight and magnifying glass. And it would be worse in any other room.
4,Excellent cookbook but lacking a couple of handy featuers,I have made a few recipes out of this cookbook and I am very satisfied with the quality. The book could be better with pictures and better organization. As it is now there are broad chapters that could use some serious refinement.
3,Religion added. Can i please just get rice?,"Book looks good with recipes. looking forward to trying a lot of them . was quite frustrated that there was information on the budhist religion in there. This should be about rice, not giving a religious history or how rice played a role in the religion. The folks were duped into fear of false gods to control the people to keep them working. Anyone can find that info online if they'd like, this book should only be about the facts of rice and recipes. Can't turn anywhere without being assaulted woth religious stuff from budhism these days."
4,Who knew you could cook so many things in a rice cooker?,"I was really surprised to see how many different kinds of foods I could cook in a rice cooker! Practical recipes with ingredients I already have on hand. Does not expect you to use exotic ingredients, though you could if you like.The only disappointment for me is that my rice cooker has only one setting, and some of the recipes ask for use of low/high settings and/or setting the timer on the rice cooker. I am hopeful that I can adapt these recipes for use with my rice cooker."
4,True,"In the very beginning of the film Pheonix says making movies isn't real, that he is just a puppet. The truth is he has an extremely rare gift, that isn't celebrated nearly enough. There are so many stars that are extremely successful with a mere fraction of the talent that Joaquin has, and I think his best days are in front of him. Oh and the film itself.... I was suprised at how good it was based on the content to work with. It was almost as sincere as JP."
1,"I couldn't watch it the whole through, mockumentary or not.",Made it half way through but I was literally falling asleep (at 2pm in the afternoon). I love Joaquin Phoenix but no one wants to watch someone parading around like a jerk like that. I'm just happy to know that it was in fact a mockumentary and he's not really like that.
1,Don'T waste your money.,I will watch a somewhat bad movie if I rent it. However I couldn't watch this one it was that bad.
2,Innovative,"Is it real? Is it fake? The simple fact that this movie has blurred the line so effectively makes it successful in its purpose. When was the last time you saw a movie and actually had no idea whether it was real or fake? I believe this film is ahead of its time, and in the future we will be seeing more movies that will make us ask this question. This will be looked back on in twenty years as being the first. That being said, the film is completely unenjoyable on every level. Bonus star for originality."
3,okay book,"This book is well writen but mainly talks about hair transplants and drugs. It doesnt really cover natural approaches to hairloss, the author doesnt address the home remedies and vitamins you can take for hairloss. I found ""Grow hair fast"" by Riqutte Hoffstien a much better source of information and HIGHLY effective treatments. an awsome book that really works."
4,Frank Tursi and his history of Winston-Salem,"Frank Tursi has done his usual good job of researching his subject. While I don't agree with some of his appraisals of the characters that made up Winston-Salem, I would not expect him to agree with all of mine. He has struck a happy medium of a blend of photos and narrative. This is a volume to be treasured by anyone interested in Winston-Salem and in history."
5,LoNoiz .065-Inch Grass Trimmer Line,Purchased this trimmer line after looking at what was available locally. The price was reasonable and the quantity was more than they had at the local stores. I used it for the first time a week ago and it worked very well. It seems to last longer than the round trimmer line I used previously. i'll have to see how well it holds up over time.
3,a great source for raw data,"Cowell's book does a great descriptive job, in the sense that it gives lots of data on various aspects of this language.The data is almost untouched: If you know a bit about modern theories then you can easily ignore the theoretical aspects (old terminology etc) hence its a great place to collect unbiased data.If you're into language learning/teaching, i dont recomend it as a textbook for SA. Its so old fashioned, it misses lots of important points which are sometimes very obvious."
5,Worm Eater Rocks!,"Its totally for adults and kids alike; its got the Harry Potter gimme more going on, but its both more contained and more global, and certainly captures the experience of being an American sixth grader whether on the Alist or the dramanerds. The plot and storytelling are witty and brilliant."
4,The Word Eater is great!,"This book is awesome! When Lerner Chanse discovers Fip a worm who eats words not dirt, she discovers the power to make anything she wants to disapear!If you like stories with suspense, the Word Eater is your kind of book."
5,"Creative, exciting and intense","Great work...I've seen Clay's plays in NY and am touched by the marriage of creativity, humor and other emotions. A strong recommendation for a discerning reader."
1,Why so much?,Why would I pay $88 for the 3 in a pack when I could buy them all seperately for $72.47? I thought the pack was supposed to save me money...
2,Maybe the begining is funny...,"The beginning of the book was funny, but than in the middle it got horrible. When I picked up the book I expected it to be funny, like Tim Dorsey's books. I didn't expect the plot to be great, just funny. But than in the middle there is a near rape scene that just goes on. What I don't understand is why it's in the book? I'm not usually one to complain about a rape scene if it's done in a non-serious funny way, or even if it's serious but it's in a serious drama. But in a book like this, a realistic near rape scene with no comedic value just doesn't make any sense. I don't enjoy in real life watching a person getting raped, which is what it was equivalent to. And as someone else said, the book seemed like a cut and paste job, so with it not being too funny, there is no real reason to read this. Anyway, I threw away the book what I got to the rape scene."
3,Fast Beach/Airplane Reading and Instantly Forgettable,"Dave Barry - Columnist: Awesome. Dave Barry - novelist: so-so.I began the book with high expectations: to laugh through the 300+ pages; perhaps even with tears in my eyes. What I experienced was an occasional guffaw every 100 pages or so.Ok, the book does move fast. If you can keep track of the gazillion characters (well, maybe 20) and their motivations, you can have fun with the book. Don't expect deep, thought-provoking, multi-layered characters. These are Florida residents we're dealing with. :-) What you get is a screwball race running on high octane that doesn't slow down until the last page."
4,Good lightweight read - a bit short,"I was at the Newark train station waiting for a train to Boston. The trip is about 4 hours. I didn't have anything to read, so I went to the newstand at the train station, and I picked up Big Trouble. I started reading as the train pulled out, and somewhere between Providence and Boston I finished the book. It was quite entertaining and made the trip go by very quickly. However, it seems a bit short for $, Still, Barry has a style and a sense of humor that make you forget you are on a train or wherever you are and focus you on the entertaining story that is taking place. I laughed out loud a couple of times, and people on the train asked me what I was reading and said that they had to get it too. Some of the characters remind me of people I've come across before in the real world. The satirical way in which they are represented cracked me up.I recommend buying this, and only wish that the book cost less since it was so short."
3,Fun for Barry fans,"Barry is a much better columnist than he is a novelist. I'm a great fan of his columns and other essays, so had high hopes for his first novel. This book started out funny, lost the humor about mid-way when he described a truly frightening episode, then tried to get funny again. The ending owes a lot to ""Dr. Strangelove, or how I learned to stop worrying..."" The vulgarity is overdone, so be warned if that bothers you.There were some great bits, like Roger the dog (although a piece Dave wrote about his own dogs in another book dedicated to dog stories was much funnier), the sports talk show, the airport, and some other sections. So, all in all, you'll get a couple hours of amusement from it - it's worth the Amazon price. But the master of the humorous novel remains P.G Woodhouse, who gives us excellent characters, complicated plots, truly humorous language, and consistent tone. Barry needs to read some Woodhouse to see how it's done."
3,disappointing,"If you're a Dave Barry fan, this book may disappoint you as it did me. The characters are an off-beat collection of humanity, and the setting is something Mr. Barry knows: Miami. He just can't sustain the story. Reading any part of the book is like reading a column; funny, at times hilarious, but putting it all together into a novel length shows the weakness of the plot and what works as terrific humor in a Sunday column gets old and really wordy. You can sum this book up in twenty pages, and he takes over 300 to write it. The best part of the book is the total SKEWERING he gives Miami! Other than that, it's not worth it. Read a collection instead: it's sustainable and infinitely funnier."
5,Vintage Dave Barry,"A simple book to critique: painfully funny. If you just like good, outlandish humor, this is for you. Warning: Don't eat or drink while reading this book."
1,Not funny,"I usually enjoy Dave Barry's writing. As I read this book I kept waiting for the humor. I gave up halfway through. Not only is it not funny, it contains descriptions of very disturbing situations guaranteed to depress you. Is there anyone out there who thinks kidnapping and attempted rape is amusing? This one deserves zero stars."
1,Big Bore,"Not a chuckle anywhere. The characters dull and moronic, story line non-existent, and romance wooden. When the boy touches the girl, the author ejaculates Whoa! over and over again as if he did not add Whoa! (in italics and with exclamation point!) then the moronic reader whould not get the significance. I have always found Dave Barry's humor weak and insipid. This book just shows off his talents at their peak. Absolutely stupid book, waste of money."
2,"Funny, but a bit amatuerish. His editors did him no favors.","Hard to believe that this guy is an accomplished author. While the book was easy reading, about 40% of the ""hilarious"" dialogue would have been edited out by your average High School writing teacher - probably with the comment ""Please try to reread these lines as a third person would, you might realize that most of them are not as funny as you think."" Its almost like Dave Barry wrote this stuff while in a giggling fit where he kept thinking that each line he spewed out was golden, unfortunately his editors and/or friends who read this manuscript didn't have the fortitude to tell the guy that some it was pure amatuer junk. They did him (or us) no favor!I read the book in a day, I think the embarassment of this amatuerish effort will haunt Dave Barry fans for a much longer time."
5,"Fun, Fun, Fun!","I love Dave Barry and found his first novel to be great fun. The second half had me on the edge of my seat with suspense and total funniness. I can't wait until Dave writes another novel. Please Dave, make it soon!"
3,Big Trouble - A Little Disappointed,"As a BIG Dave Barry fan, I was a little disappointed. The story had its moments but unfortunately not enough of them were as funny as his weekly syndicated pieces. I got some good laughs but the story just didn't hold together until the end."
3,So-So,"A funny and fast-paced book, marred by paper-thin characters (with one or two exceptions), pontificating by the author (enough about cigars already), and the same Miami jokes repeated ad nauseum. No worse than your average best-seller, though, and funnier than most."
4,A Scambled Plot Makes Fast Reading,"Dave Barry enters the ranks of the South Florida crime writers, such as Hiaasen and Shames, who are more interested in generating laughs than laying down a straight plot. Teenagers, assassins, police, G-men, and goats combine to swiftly move along a plot filled with mistaken identities, nuclear bombs, and goats across the highway. Barry may pose no threat to the serious writer of crime fiction, but is a welcome addition to the world of comical capers involving hit men and other nefarious characters."
2,A predictable story,"I have always been a great fan of Dave Barry and I have read most of his books and articles, which overall I've enjoyed reading. I definitely feel that this story is quite predictable and it is a lot longer than it really needed to be, for some unknown reason. I thought that the plot of the story was quite common and predictable in general. I am looking forward to reading more of Dave Barrys' funny observations on various aspects of life and jobs, but I don't think that I will read another novel style book by Dave Barry."
1,Stick with column-writing Dave,"Dear Dave - You shouldn't have listened to whoever it was that encouraged you to write a novel. Big Trouble is a big mess. I should've guessed that (as with most books that include giant acknowledgement sections, particularly where the author admits to not having any idea what the plot of the book was going to be) this would be a really stupid, juvenile book. The problem with this book, even as a comedy, is that there are too many implausibilities. You might as well have included a Martian invasion or two. Thanks for wasting several hours of my time."
5,"Excellent product, excellent value!","This is excellent jerky. It is flavorful and not a major jaw workout. The meat is essentially organic (no antibiotics, pesticides, added hormones), just not certified as such. I'm so thrilled that I've found such a flavorful, portable, and healthy snack without Nitrates, Nitrites, and MSG. My husband is a jerky connoisseur and he loves this jerky. You absolutely cannot beat the price either, which is a MAJOR bonus. The bag states to use the product within 3 days... umm, a whole pound of jerky in three days?! We have used ours 10-14 days after opening with no change in taste or texture."
2,Displeased,"When I ordered this cd I was hoping it would have all the theme songs from all the series and a couple of other songs used in the show on occasions. I was surprised when I finally got it and listened to it. There is only one actual theme song, and two remixes of theme songs (By the way the remixes are terrible compared to the originals.) I watched power rangers all the way through lost galaxy and I only recognize a couple of the other songs. I don't know what they were thinking when they chose the tracks for this supposedly ""Best Of"" cd. Most of the songs are from around 1996 off of Power Rangers Zeo I believe but only a few bring back memories. I wouldn't buy this for a kid who was new to the show. Only for people looking for some nostalgia."
1,not what you think it is.,I bought the album thinking it would have the original versions of the theme songs but it didn't. I would not recommend this album to the fans of the Power Rangers from the late 90's to early 2000's.
4,The suggestions are good...the example letters are lacking,"I found the suggestions in the book to be helpful. Unfortunately, many of the example cover letter failed to follow the guidelines. For instance, on page 47, ""Don't tell them what you want them to do or that you'll call to schedule an interview."" The cover letter on page 153 says, ""I will call in approximately two weeks to discuss how I hope to contribute to your school."" The cover letter on page 158 says, ""Please contact me at the above address..."" As long as the reader is aware of the inconsistencies, it is not a big deal. Just don't plan on using every word from any given cover letter!"
2,IMMATURE,"I think it's really dumb the way Elizabeth and Jessica fight in this book. They argue about petty, stupid things that don't even really matter. They wasting months of their lives arguing about nothing. Infantile."
4,Replacement adapeter works fine,"Overall, the adapeter replacement works fine. I plugged it in and the unit powered up. I am still a bit frustrated that I needed to replace this adapter. The Garmin unit is great - the directions and interface work incredibly well - but this adapter design is less than ideal. I had the 2720 unit less than two years and I needed to spend ~$100 to get it current - replacing this adapter and buying the updated mapping CD."
2,Garmin speaker for StreetPilot 2620,"The speaker part of this item is fine. The slide-on electrical connector is poorly engineered. After a short time, the plastic ""wings"" on the connector bend slightly, making one of the contacts not mate properly. This electrical connector is far to complicated and delicate for anything but occosional use. Shame, Garmin."
5,Thanks,"I had an Epilady from the 80's that finally 'died'. I never see these advertised, and don't like to shop. Amazon came through when I finally thought to order on line! I have trouble with arthritis in my hands. This is so comfortable to hold and maneuver. Thanks to Amazon and to the 'Epi' folks for such a great hair remover!"
1,Wasted money!,We wasted our money on amazon instant video cuz we can't even watch the movie... They should make the amazon movies downloadable..... What a waste that was.. It's not worth the one star I gave it cuz we couldn't even watch it... Was forced to put a star..
3,Decent and worth watching.,"The Justice League Unlimted Seasons 1 & 2 are ok, but not as good as the original Justice Leauge. The stories jump around and the immense roster will keep you scratching your head. But all in all is decent if you are a DC fan."
3,I like it better than that amazing.,"Well, I think it's new for dvd as 2 years ago. I want to watch it if the other children want to see it like other of them."
5,"Brand New, Looks Great","WE bought this carseat because with our research, it was one of the best brands/models available. I was pleased to find this pattern at a lower price than the others, and since we didn't really care, we got it at a great price. The seat fits in our Subaru Outback just great and we've had no problems whatsoever."
2,Britax Marathon Convertible Car Seat,"The seat seemed quite comfortable for our 9 month old baby. But now at 10 and after another growth spurt I can't wait until we can turn the seat forward as her poor feet meet the back seat and she looks ""squished"". I preferred our previous car seat, the Graco SnugRide infant car seat for ease of installation and removal (a God send during travel). Which brings me to my biggest complaint; sub-par installation. It just doesn't seem as safe and secure as our previous seat. What's more, not everywhere we fly to has a car seat rental option with the car rental - more remote, smaller airports. The Britax seat is clumsy and frustrating to remove and the plastic seat belt security clips feel very cheap. It looks like a nice, comfortable seat but it just doesn't feel as safe, from a car safety viewpoint."
4,"Good Seat, Great Service","We've had this seat for two months now and love it. It is very easy to install into vehicles with the latch system and is equally easy to remove. We also like the pull strap at the front of the seat to tighten the shoulder harnesses after buckling in the little one. Our biggest complaint is that the shoulder straps seem to twist and tangle quite often, making it a challenge to buckle in a squirming child at times.Overall, a great seat and great pricing & service from Amazon."
1,"Putting ""Rapist"" Back In ""Therapist""",Readers should be aware that one of the authors of this book is *at this very moment* on trial for multiple counts of statutory sodomy. Probably not the best idea in the world to follow the teachings of a pedophile when it comes to managing residential treatment facilities for young victims.
2,Cordless Screwdriver,"This was the second one I bought. The first one was good, the second one was junk. The battery doesn't last as long as it should. They should always give a new battery with reconditioned units."
4,Beg to differ,"I prefer Revisited to current Fogerty performances. Fogerty plays em exactly like on the records...all 2 mins and 25 secs of a song. Nothing diff, no inspiration, no jamming, nothing creative. May as well just play the records. Revisited, in my unhumble opinion, improves on the great songs of CCR. Longer versions, some improv etc. Great stuff."
3,"Good info, but could use some more editing",We bought this workbook and the video series that goes with it. Overall the information is very good and we have implemented the recommendations in our house. The workbook and the video could have used some additional editing.
5,Fantastic!!,"Read the other reviews and you will find that these glasses are *great.* They have a great lens color, very sturdy frame that is neat and trendy, and the fit and finish can't be beat. They even come with a satin bag that fits the glasses to keep them from getting scratched in a bag or pack, which is a nice bonus.My only complaint is that the orange ear pieces are slightly ""platicky."" Other than that, they are comfortable, dark, and exactly what I was looking for.(17 year old male from the states)"
1,Still got bitten by mosquitoes!!,Recently I was in St. Maarten and was afraid of the possibility of deadly mosquito bites so I purchased two bottles of this 100% Deet insect repellent. I incurred at least twenty mosquito bites and my friends teased me and said that maybe the repellent did just the opposite: attracted the bugs!! I was so disappointed!!!
1,Over priced and low quality. After first use wouldn't relight.,After one use the candle wouldn't light again. Low quality and tiny for the price. Can not recommend this item at all.
1,Mixing Christianity with Evolution,"I was disappointed that this book tries to blend evolutionary theory with a Christian perspective. Evolution contradicts the Bible and a Christian world-view and it's dangerous to try to mix the two. I am surprised that a publisher like Tommy Nelson would put this into the hands of children. Lesson to be learned: just because a book is ""Christian"" doesn't mean parents should assume it is what they want for their kids! I highly recommend the Jonathan Park audio series for adventure and creationist perspective."
3,Good while it lasted.,"The handles are heavier than my other weighted ropes which was a nice change. Additionally, since the rope part is plastic, it had a nice return on it allowing for good speeds.Note the use of the past tense.Indeed, on my fourth use of it (I jump between 15 and 40 minutes a session), while doing a series of power jumps (AKA double unders), the rope tore loose of the handle, nearly crashing into the glass shelves on my living room walls.No damage done but I can't use it in its current state and don't care to repair it if that entails putting my living room (or passers-by for that matter)in jeopardy."
1,Waste of Time & Money,"I was very disappointed with this book especially since it was branded with Sunset Magazine's name. Very basic vanilla information on garages and workshops. If you are just now learning what a garage is, then this book is for you."
3,No New Info,"For as long as I can remember, I've been a Motley Crue fan. So when I saw that Tommy Lee had a book out, I was stoked. Unfortunately, none of the information in his book was new.If you've read ""The Dirt"" I wouldn't bother with this book. If you can get it at your local library, great. If not pick up The Dirt instead."
3,Not what the Doctor ordered!,"This is not what I had expected out of the self confessed ""bad boy"" that he is or once was.Seems more of a self loathing and poor poor pitiful me approach. Sorry you had some hard times dude, must you subject all of us to this, we all have. Must of us didn't have the money to make things go away."
3,Tommyland? More like Boringland.,"I expected a lot more from Mr. Lee. First of all, having his d@#k ""write"" part of the book- not a good idea. There wasn't much in here that I didn't already know about him. I love the Crue, and Tommy, but it just seems like he could've written more about his family and less about his sex life. I know that's what he's known for- more than his drumming it seems like- but all in all, it was a struggle to get through this book. And dude- no more Methods of Mayhem PLEASE!!!!!"
1,When full can't be moved by ordinary humans,"I thought this was so cool looking and the kids loved rolling around in it empty, but as soon as we started filling it up, the coolness faded. The lid pops off as you roll it and it finally gets too heavy for even my very strong husband to reasonably roll. It is sitting empty right now and we only use it when we have overflow for our standard tumbler composters that we need to store and transfer over. A waste of money. Maybe they should sell them as kids toys."
5,The Waltons - Fifth Season,"If you loved The Waltons when they were on TV, you will love these DVDs. They brought me back to when I was young and I love the Waltons all over again! Highly recommend!!"
4,Good product when properly configured,"I got this adapter to allow a recorder (KISS DP 558)to connect wirelessly to my WIFI network and hence avoid running cable all around the house.This product is very basic and not very sophisticated. However the set up was frustrating:1- the PC/laptop used for the initial setup has to have a fixed IP in the same rage as the WGA542- If using mac filtering, make sure the mac address of the adaptor and the device to be networked are both entered in the mac list.3- Even though the adaptor has found the router and got connected, the status LEDs will only light when data is transfered. Thi scan be misleading especially at the begining when looking for signs of life.When all the above was done, the adapter functionned perfectly and video and audio streaming as well as file transfering was a joy."
2,not good,"They are okay for the price but they are a little small. Also, the first night out one of the three tines broke off in a frog?! Maybe cause our frogs are big as brock lesnar's fist but maybe cause they are cheaply made."
5,One of the Best Historical Novels Ever Written,"I must admit I haven't read this book in a while, but recall when I read it, wishing it would never end. It is truly gripping and filled with drama. This is more than historical fiction, it is a great novel which ""gets inside the head"" of a fascinating person and his relationship with Elizabeth. The historical details appear correct. Put away the Bernard Cornwells, the Sharon Kay Penmans, the Anya Setons and the rest of the pulp historial fiction writers and read this book."
5,Enjoyable Drama,"Once things get going, it's a very enjoyable drama. There were times, on the weekend, I could not stop watching 'cause I wanted to see what happened next. The captions are good. I have found that sometimes, on any of the Korean dramas, I have to go back and pause to read them because there are times when the background is too close to the caption color.Other than that little nit-pic, it's a very good drama."
2,The book you want is...,"""Halo 2 Hacks: Tips & Tools for Finishing the Fight""I have not read the book THIS review is under, but I have read through the title above...Just read the reviews for it and you'll see what I mean."
1,Not for me.,"I would say if you are very far from the station, try something else. I found this unit to be way over priced for the performance. It did not get all the channels a 38 dollar antenna was pulling in.Amazon was VERY KIND to take the unit back :-)"
5,Great HD antenna at superb price via Amazon.com,"I live in Kensington, MD which is within the Washington, DC metro area. I had the antenna installed inconspicuously on the roof. We are no longer using cable TV or satellite TV signals. We are using this antenna as our only TV signal source. We are also using an antenna signal amplifier, the TERK 15 dB Broadband Cable Amplifier. We get amazing digital signals from various local channels including FOX, CBS, ABC, several PBS channels, TFA, CW, and UNI. The picture quality from these digital channels is awesome, and it's all free!Of course, we do not get all of the sports channels, Discovery channel, History channel, and HGTV for my wife, but we supplement our TV watching with DVDs from Blockbuster.com (Netflix is another fine option).Considering the ever increasing cost of Cable or Satellite TV along with the cost of equipment rental, this antenna along with the signal amplifier is a fine option to consider."
3,Expensive for a passive antenna,The reception that it pick is low. I had to invest in a inline signal amplifier from radio shack.
5,hd tv antenna,this antenna was very easy to install. after installation I am able to receive 28 digital channels.
1,My rabbit ears worked better!,"I had high hopes for this product, but it didn't work AT ALL. Honestly, putting my rabbit ears outside worked better! With this antenna we were able to get PBS solidly, besides that we could get two other stations but not at the same time. We would have to move the antenna in different directions and could pick up one, then move the antenna again and sometimes get the other. It was horrible! We are not that far out of town, maybe 10 miles, but we do have a lot of rolling hills and trees around us. Still, I expected a lot more from this product. Thankfully we sent it back and amazon refunded us. We bought the MUCH cheaper Antennas Direct DB2 Multi Directional HDTV Antenna that was $39.00 and it works awesome just sitting on our floor!"
3,almost there,"Not bad. But why is one particular channel unable to be picked up? I can recieve channels above and below it in terms of freqencies, and they look okay. But there is one in the middle that I just cannot pick up. The HD rabbit ears do a much better job for this one.I would see if you could try this before you buy."
1,Application Wrong,"I am about 25 miles as the crow flys from the nearest digital broadcast. After only receiveing analog uhf signals I called Terk Tech Support. They told me that this unit is designed for reflected ""in city"" signals only; plus there may have been something wrong with the unit, so much for that, returned it. I went to a standard inexpensive uhf antenna and it worked fine. I have since found that you do not need a special antenna for HD-Digital signals, the standrd ones work fine, you just have to be within range. In my case the uhf digital signal is clear and the analog is poor."
5,great purchase,"I have 2 high-def TVs. I put this antenna in my attic, and used a co-ax splitter to run two cables down to my separate TVs. The reception is fantastic. People cannot believe that they are watching High-Def without paying for digital cable or Satellite service. Seriously a GREAT investment."
2,Extremely poor print quality,"I bought it because it was highly recommended by others and I have a lot of honey to eat from a local farm. Several of the recipes do look like they will be good so I am giving it a couple of stars. The downside? This appears to be a ""print on demand book"" and the print quality was abysmal. It looked like a very very poor photo copy that was run off of an old printer that was almost out of toner. Large areas of pages were unreadable. The rest of the text was very faint and looked like the paper had moved fractionally during printing creating a halo effect to much of the text. I had never had this experience with Amazon before, so I returned it. The new copy I got was marginally better, but still very poor quality. I was going to give it as a Christmas gift, but I am too embarrassed to send it to anyone."
4,Back Saver,Cutoff a lot of manhours in the decking installations. Be prepared for some jams though everytime you reload. I went through about 18-20 screws just fine then had to unjam the head. Unjamming is easy enough though. Saves a lot of wear and tear on your back!!
3,Dizzy,The story was very slow to develop and the time swings were just too much. Sadly I was unable to finish this one (which is rare for me). Jackson should have settled on a timeline and stuck with it.
3,Who Am I?,"How easily blood lines can be twisted and turned. Finding out that she is not who she thought she was after being told by her dieing father in a remote Montana farm community that she had been abducted at a young age, London Danvers goes to Portland Oregon seeking her biological family. Suspicious of her motives, her siblings do all they can to keep her from proving her identity, even murder.This is a moving mystery with lots of genetic twists. Greed is the ultimate reason for most of the action. An interesting read."
3,It's okay!!!,"I thought the plot of the main female character not knowing for sure who she really was, was very good at the beginning. However as the book went on, the plot began to lose its hold on my attention. When Adrian fell in love with, and had sexual relations with, a person whom she believed to be her half-brother, I began to lose interest. The assumption I made and was hoping would turn out to be true, was the fact that they were not brother and sister as that would have been disgusting. Therefore I assumed there would be a twist at the end to explain away this obvious shortfall in the plot.I would recommend this as I did enjoy reading the book, it just got a little long with the development of the ending which I thought was obvious from about halfway through.DVG"
2,not professional,"This book is a coffee table book. The pictures are nice, but it does not give any new or valuable information regarding garden design (no reference to styles or history whatsoever). It is not a book for professionals. I only gave it the 2 stars because the cover and pictures are pretty. If you are seriously interested in design, don't buy this book."
4,again almost 5,"As with the second book I loved it but there is too much of a span of time between the first and the second. When you leave off with the second book Ged and Vetch return from Ged over coming the shadow, in the third it starts some 15 years later. Now Ged is the Archmage. What happened in the 15 year span. Even a brief telling would be sufficent. Even with that the book was great. Kept me intrigued as to what will happen next."
3,"Formulaic and predictable, but some worthwhile moments","This story has an intriguing premise, but the initial pages set up a framework in which even a young adult reader could predict the ensuing plot. Therefore, the rest of the story moves towards its expected ending with no surprises or twists. However, there are some nuggets of wisdom and brilliance along the way--sometimes just a single line or image. So, while this isn't necessarily a dramatic story, it is worth reading for the vintage LeGuin treasures that are interspersed throughout the book."
3,"""Agni, Lebannen!""","While not as detailed or as ornate as THE LORD OF THE RINGS, LeGuin's Earthsea Cycle is considered among the finest of the Sword and Sorcery classics. THE FARTHEST SHORE is the third book in the Cycle.THE FARTHEST SHORE is the most ambitious of the first three books in the Cycle. Another quest novel, it touches on themes of life, death, power, authority, youth and maturation.In THE FARTHEST SHORE, Ged (now Archmage) and Lebannen, the young uncrowned King of Earthsea, are pitted against the wizard Cob, who has discovered the key to eternal life, really a kind of joyless undeath that saps the world of everything meaningful. In undoing Cob's evil, Ged loses his power, while Lebannen comes into his own.Somewhat too heavily laced with symbolism, THE FARTHEST SHORE is still the most powerful of the early Earthsea novels. LeGuin's dragons, in particular, are amazing creatures unlike any other in Sword and Sorcery literature: ""Dragons are dreams..."""
2,Bandwagon profits,I read this book: There's nothing quite like someone trying to make money off someone else's success. Perhaps the author should take a more authentic approach to her skills as a writer and create something original of her own.
3,Not for older kids...,"If you can get past the first 15 minutes of idiotic cartoon banter, this DVD has a little bit of very basic information for actually playing football. Younger kids (8 and under) will probably like it, but older kids will be bored."
5,perfect,This toy is the perfect match for the other three items I have of this line. Now the collection is complete. These are definately a must have for any true Beatles fan.
5,Exceptional Listening,"Jim Rohn's ""The Art of Exceptional Living"" is really great for those wanting to be independent and advance in your business/career. This is very easy listening and really gets you thinking, ""What if"" or ""Why not me?"" There are some very key points he makes that are so obvious when you hear them, but we might not take that time to think about them otherwise.Jim Rohn is a wonderful teacher and philisopher, keeping things very simple and fun- the whole idea behind the art of exceptional living."
5,Inspire me to do things different in my life .,"After listening to the tapes I culden't wait to read the book .On the tape and in the book Jim Rohn help me to understand why am I having problems ,to overcome some difficulties of my life .I listen to the tapes ,over and over and every time I listen I find out a new better way to handel specific problem .It inspire me to turn my life around and putt me on the right track.I am planing to stay there and constantly improve my life .I highly recomend this book for anyone.It is funny to read or listen and I am sure anyone will find something itresting for them self .I know that my life changed for so much better after reading and understanding the Art of exceptional living ."
4,is it for real?,I believe this is the REAL WEN but my daughter ask about it...........it was a gift to her from me. She said she read where Wen had been duplicated and sold as Wen when it wasn't. I have no idea what to say about this product since it was a gift to her and she doesn't know if its real or not. The order came timely and was packaged nice. I would order from this company again unless I heard differently fromothers.
3,WEN in doubt...,"I used this product for the very first time today. I ordered the introductory package(4-6 oz bottles) for $40.95 at QVC. With the amt of cleanser I used (20% of bottle for 8-10 pumps each top, nape, ends), I'm afraid I'll probably not repurchase. I have fine thinner hair and I thought that perhaps it would feel weighed down; it didn't. It is soft and not flyaway although I feel it has a bit of a waxy finish. On the other hand, because you really have to work it through for the shower and then leave-in, I lost twice the amount of hair in the drain. That does not make me happy. I'm hoping that it only happens the 1st time and the instructions say you can go 2-3 days per washing. We'll see and I'll update when the bottle is used up and again using the other formulas: fig, cucumber-aloe, and tea tree. Hair looks good on second day but feels dry.UPDATE:*** The same thing happened on the second washing. I'm almost afraid to use it again."
4,Softer healthier hair,"I'm the original scarecrow when it comes to dry hair. Mostly my ends are bad, so I'm always looking for something that make my frizzy hair more manageable. I also have a dry itchy scalp, so it's important to find something to ease the itch. I heard about Wen from a blog and decided to try it. Everything I read said I should be using the fig conditioner. I'm really glad I bought the sampler, as it turns out the cucumber is the best one for me. No more itchy scalp and clean soft hair. I'd still like a bit more moisture, but that could be just me.Overall, I really like this product and will definitely buy it again. it won't make you have hollywood hair, but it will make it healthier and nicer. I'll be buying more soon."
4,Russell Sport Pants are cool,"For the money, these are great sport pants. I don't do much in them except hang out in the house and walk my dogs. They're soft, have nice deep pockets, a drawstring, and are gathered at the ankles. I've been practically living in them while at home after work. They're a blend of cotton and poly, which I wasn't sure I'd like, but they're great. They come out of the dryer ready to wear. Price point was very sensible and represented good value."
3,Sub-par welding,"Just got it delivered for my 9 year old daughter, to find it scratched on both sides of the mirror frame and the welding looks like it was done by a child; big gaps and not smooth at all. I am quite sad :( Trying to decide if I should return it or see if the husband can fix it. Very sad face child here too...I talked with the very helpful and pleasant staff at Wildon Home Burns, and they are going to replace the vanity with no charge. I found my entire experience with this company and every employee I spoke with to be pleasant, helpful and professional in every way; I would recommend them to any and all."
5,extreamly helpful,"I had read Lee's book ""Alive with Color"" which shows how to pick colors that you wear. From this I was able to save time and money in purchasing clothes that worked for me. Her new book moves into your environment and helps you create the type of atmosphere that you want to have surround you in your daily living. To me Lee is an expert on color and as an artist I have found it very helpful to view colors in other ways that she has expressed in both of her books.It is easy to follow and is a must for anyone wishing to create the atmosphere they desire."
1,Interesting only for the history of color and new age ideas.,"I actually returned this book as I was looking to create combinations of color for my apt. that would not clash. This book did not provide me with those helpful tips, but gave new age ideology which isn't something that people looking for decorating tips would need. I was not interested in the history of color. I didn't think this book should be placed in the ""Home Decorating"" section of a bookstore, but rather in the ""new age"" section."
5,EXCELLENT !!!,WOW. This encyclopedia is a great reference for any Catholic.Amazing insight and great explanations for all to understand.Great buy !
2,Not for History Buffs,"Apparently the author had an inspirational idea for a story...Problem apparently is that there simply aren't enough records / detailed accounts to create a book based on this topic. How much time did the writer spend researching this book? Even anecdotal evidence is severely limited. The information is meandering, sometimes frustrating in its lack of relation to the supposed theme of the book. Out of the entire book, only two references to actual animal anecdotes were interesting. How disappointing."
2,Too Much!,"This is history by committee. There are 6 different authors listed for this book, and each of them should have just written a text about their own area of expertise. The text is dry, droning on and on, yet somehow not really getting to any point. I suppose it just lacks a voice or a focus.It doesn't help that the publisher has crammed in so much to a relatively small trade paperback book by using a small font (about a 10 or an 8). They've also used a light ink on a semi-gloss paper which makes reading uncomfortable. Yes there are full color illustrations and maps throughout, but frankly, I would rather have a text that's more engaging and easily read."
5,The Waltons,"I missed most of the episodes of The Walton's when I was growing up. When I saw them on Amazon I knew I had to have them!Every time one episode came out, I ordered it. We love them all."
4,great gift,"I bought 2, one for each of my grandsons but turned out to be a useful family gift. Easy to assemble and was much larger than I expected for the price. My daughters haul my grandkids, can easily fit 2 per wagon, to the park or my house. Kids are too young to do more than enjoy the rides for now but wagons are so well built I expect they will still be around when kids are old enough to play with them as well as in them. Big negative shocker was the mailing charges."
4,A littlle disappointing,"I will be honest I saw Epilogue from justice league unlimited season 1. I was expecting the new Batman season 3 to have the bigger badder Terry in it but, but was a little disappointed to find to find Terry making the same old mistakes he made in seasons 1 and 2. Having said that is you rate this serise on it's own merits the season is actually quite good. Especially the out the past episodes where Bruce is young again, also the curse of cobra where Bruce sends Terry to brush on his martial arts, even the call with the JLA of tomorrow and Superman were excellent. The only Problem I have with the series is that there does not seem to be any development with Terry as he still makes the same mistake that he always did. Even the problem with Dania was never sorted out."
4,"""Gotta love Batman""","McGinnis has earned his right to be called the ""Batman"" after all he was a student of the original. He does not think so, He thinks He has nothing in common with the original ""Batman"". Yet soon he will find out his heroism is not unnoticed."
2,Subtitles????,"Batman Beyond - Season Three (DC Comics Classic Collection)I love the series but it said it come in spanish and guest what??, it didn't the first and the second have subtitles at least but this one is announced with spanidh languaje and i am still waiting for it. Really crappy"
3,disc 1 - 4 stars disc 2 - 2 stars,"minus one for no sub-titles, but disc 2 - action scenes were bad and dialogue was terrble. Watch disc 1 skip 2."
5,The Best Batman Ever!!!!!,"This is definitely the next step they should take in the Batman franchise in cinemas, of course under the direction of Christopher Nolan, my God, this movie would be a complete hit! Batman Beyond is definitely the best that ever happened to Batman even before Nolan."
4,Incredibly Wild,"I'm hesitant to say that it's going to change your life; you would certainly be better off meeting a wonderful teacher who can show you wonderful things about the world (and if you haven't emt one yet then you need to get cracking), but Roger Von Oech's Whack Packs are so very fun to play around with ;)Predictably, all of the cards are just critical enough to be applicable to everything in the universe, just like depressing movies will never fail to get you thinking about the things you might want to change in yourself... But it's incredibly enjoyable to share with friends and have some fun with.I'm particularly partial to the art style (it reminds me of Terry Gilliam) and the vignettes are fantabulous."
5,"Yes, great pack!","It's amazing that this product gets five straight stars from all the reviewers. Nothing is worth a perfect score like that, but this product does. This is truly an amazing product. I used these cards all the time (well, maybe not all the time, but when I need a little boost of creativity, these cards really help.) I've had these cards in my arsenal for over ten years. I have not lost a card yet.The author asks you to challenge the rules and ask questions. As President and Creative Director of a highly creative web design company called AUDIN Web Design, these cards resonate deeply in my creativity. These cards are rule breakers.The author challenges you to:""Think like a kid""""Change its name""""Look somewhere else""""Listen to you dreams""""Check you timing""""Exaggerate""And finally:""Be whacky""Bottom Line: If you don't like to read (a book) and you want to stimulate your mind, get these cards. They will totally change the way you think about creative (and maybe not so creative) problems."
5,It's the I Ching -- only better!,"I love this set of 64 cards. Based on the ancient wisdom of the I Ching this card set is simply the most creative, brilliant way to problem solve ever invented. By using 4 archetypes, Explorer, Artist, Judge and Warrior, author Roger von Oech shows us how to use our creativity to to its fullest potential... in a really simple way with lots of examples. And sharing the Whack Pack with friends has led to many memorable discussions and projects! There's a reason this product has been around for such a long time. It's fantastic."
1,Uses watch batteries,"Got this for my son for Xmas ...is smaller than expected..turning it on & off is difficult..you have to twist it, we used pliers and the.battery was dead after 3days"
3,gave as gift,I gave this as a gift to a friend. She has not been able to figure out how to turn it on. It did not come with any instructions.
3,Lacks a snug fit,"If you already own an iGo charger, then dropping $9.99 on a new Power Tip is probably a much cheaper alternative to buying a whole new charger. The problem is that the A43, at least for my Palm Centro, is a poor fit. It charges well but the connection is so loose that if I accidentally bump or need to move the phone the Power Tip usually falls right out of the phone. It's extremely annoying.I wouldn't dissuade anyone from buying this charging tip, but don't expect to use it in a situation in which the phone will be moved often (e.g. in the car, talking on it while it is charging). Keep in mind that I have only used this with my Palm Centro. It may work better for Treos and other phones."
5,Great Book!,Scenes for Teens is an excellent resource! Scenes are easy to read and are fun to perform. Chambers Stevens really helps teens connect with their inner actor with this study guide!
1,Very good,"This book wasn't the best. I liked it a lot it was cute but not for my age, so i do not recommend this book to any of you. don't waste your money on it it's a bunch a bs"
2,Ducks in Muck,"This book is really simple. I would recommend it to kids ages 3-6. It has rhyming patterns to help teach the kids how to read. It's about ducks and truck getting stuck in muck, the ducks get away but the truck is still stuck in muck."
1,Honest Review of Kerberos: A Network Authentication System,"I purchased this book in order to read before installing and configuring Kerberos V5 on my servers. My thoughts were that it would be good to have a little book vs. the README files and on-line documents. I was wrong.For example, section 3.3.2 on configuring the KDC file is missing basic minimal information that it takes to make kerberos work. The instructions are wrong and missing many basic configuration parameters. There are much better sources on the net and the sources are MUCH more accurate.I hope the next Kerberos book is accurate and value-added. We sure need one!! Kerberos can be complex to install and with Microsoft supporting Kerberos V5 now, we need better books on the subject so we can work on cross-realm or cross-domain interoperability.Unfortunately, this is not the book for anyone who really wants to install Kerberos and would like a reference to do so. Avoid this one."
3,it's okay,"It's okay, but based on some of the review by others I thought this book would have a better discription of neighborhoods & the advantages/disadvantages of living in them. Gave a good overview of how the rental market works, but is missing lots of the free fun stuff & advice given in some other books."
1,The road to what???,After seeing the movie a few years ago (and thinking it was quite odd) I decided to take a shot at the book. At first it started out great and I was really interested in the storyline. The idea of 4 time a day enemas and cleansing the colon had me hooked! However then the book got going and I realized there was more to the story than the cleansing of the colon.About halfway through the book I started to get bored. I took a look at my to-be-read book pile and longed for something else. WELLVILLE did not have a plot that I could see. The book was all 'story' and very little climax. Once I finished it I was disappointed and glad for it to be over with at the same time.
1,What If Fiction!,"I believe the author of the Road to Wellville would have accomplished a lot more if he had written a historical, instead of a fictional account of the BattleCreek Sanitarium.Dr. Kellogg did not DIE at age seventy of a heart attack, but lived until 1943 and died at the age of 91 years. having been born in 1852."
4,The American Dream,"The main plot of the Road to Wellville focuses on physiologic living - perfect physical health. But there's more to the book than that. Charlie Ossining is in search of the American Dream of business success. Mr. Lightbody is in search of the perfect love, whether with his wife or his nurse. George Kellogg is obsessed with revenge. Dr. Kellogg is trying to preserve his reputation and fame. These are all things many of us seek today. When Boyle pokes gentle, and not-so-gentle, fun at his characters, he is poking fun at us. The novel is well-paced, moving fairly smoothly from one set of characters to another. There are lots of people with varying degrees of importance to the story, and sometimes it is hard to keep track of every plot twist. Overall, however, most readers should be able to find at least one person to take an interest in."
1,Extra cost to install,"Because the included gasket was such poor quality, water leaked underneath it, and I had to get the plumber to come back. Plus, the nut that needed to be tightened from beneath the sink was so thin that the plumber struggled to get a grip on it to tighten it, while I held the pipe wrench above the sink. Next time, I would have the installer use plumber's putty (which shouldn't be necessary with the included gasket) and, if possible, find a thicker nut at a hardware store, so it would be easier to grip and quicker to tighten. To me, the manufacturer saved 2 cents in his cost, but I had to spend an extra $100 in the long run for the installation. The original faucet #500 lasted 20 years. Hopefully this replacement faucet will last a little while before it needs to be replaced again. This is a 2-person job unless your plumber will let you hold the wrench above the sink while he/she tightens from below."
1,POINTLESS GADGET,"Waste of money. If you want to play DDR using your fingers, just use your controller. That's what I do."
5,The best Sci Fi Book I have ever read,"A simple tale of underdog, battles against all adversity picks up innumerrable skills along the way, Becomes hero, Wins girl. I have read many Sci Fi books from James Blish to EE Doc Smith but this is the most enjoyable and fun book I have read so far in the last 25 years"
4,"An all-around ""ok"" book","This book upped my average a little and gave me some helpful tips, but it is so outdated that 80% of all the things it says are wrong. When the book came out, urethane balls were just invented."
2,Trial and Error,"The basic message was ""trial and error"" which, while it may be true, gives the reader no foundation upon which to build. Over and over, the authors related how professionals might approach a certain shot but that we needed to use trial and error to find how we should hit it, rather than to give some solid principle to begin to build our own process."
3,Hunter remote,"Fan turns on by itself. It's done that at random times....we're home, out, and even when we went on vacation. The fan just goes on high speed all by itself. Can't figure out if it's the neighbor's interference. The only way around it is the pull the fan chain till it goes off, and then the remote doesn't work. When we want the fan, we pull the chain on, and then we can use the remote from our chair for the speed. That solved the problem for us."
4,Remote Control for Hunter Fan,"This remote received various reviews from previous buyers...some good, some terrible. I was reluctant to buy it but it was the only option for the outdoor fan that I purchased. The fan has been up for just 2 weeks, and so far the remote has performed perfectly. No problems at all.We'll see with time, but I'm optimistic."
1,Chaotic control,"Since the operative idea is to have control over the fan, having the fan go on in the middle of the night for no apparent reason is aggravating. Is it the neighbor's garage door opener? The government's time signal? Minor fluctuations in the quality of electricity coming into the house? Unknown. It's summer, and the weather is mild, yet the fan will come on spontaneously, as will the light, which is a sleep killer in the middle of the night. The only solution is to turn the fan off at the switch, which means that if you WANT the fan on during the night, you'll have to live with the light coming on at 3a.m.Bad design, from an engineer who didn't field test the product.By the way, it's the same with the Hunter fans that come with the remote control units."
1,Useless - cannot control lights from wall switch,"I have an old hunter remote with no ""ghost"" issues, and it lets me control the lights from the wall switch as well as the remote. I just installed this unit and found out that I can no longer control the lights by the wall switch. Try entering a dark room and having to look for the remote in order to turn the lights on."
2,Will work once the redesigned unit hits the market,"I had exactly the same problems as others have noted, and after much effort got in touch with the customer service manager who really paid attention to my problem. They have redesigned the control, and shipped me a pre-production sample to test. This updated unit works fine. So hold off for a while until version 1.1 comes on the market."
4,Works greats,"The instructions for this remote state that the wall switch can be used to turn on the light, but that is no longer true. I contacted support, and they said it no longer works this way, only the remote can be used. Mu original Hunter remote which i had for 8 years, allowed control from light switch. I am asking Hunter for an extra (free) transmitter) to make up for the fact that they ""lie"". Like everyone else. If the ""remote"" is mounted at wall switch, that means it cant be on my night-table, I still have to get out of bed to control fan. If I have to get out bed, I didn' need to spend $40 on a remote. I can pull the chain, like they pull mine. I dont see the point in purchasing a remote like this. Waste of money. Unless you buy two."
2,fan control,should not be sold with fans that come with compact flow lamps...ok for incandesent lamps only..needs to be made in usa also...i dont trust china products..
3,"Hit or miss, I guess...","We own four of these units and one of a different style and have had them all for 3+ years. Of the four, Hunter 27185's, three have performed flawlessly. The fourth, similar to other reviews listed, acts-up frequently. The light comes on whenever it wants, even after multiple frequency changes. The fan, ""obeys,"" the control, but the light has a mind of its own. I like the Hunter units better than the competitor control we have, but would purchase from someplace that allows worry-free, returns. Keep returning units until you get a good one... Good luck."
1,Hunter remote - interference problems,"This remote suffers from a fatal interference problem, where the light or fan turns on by itself. Wish I had read all the reviews about this problem before I purchased the remote. I changed the default dip switch setting on installation but the problem began the day I installed it. Rather than take down the fan, change the dip switch to a new setting, try again, and repeat over and over until I find a setting with no interference I am going to take the fan down once and install another brand remote. The time it takes to take down the fan and put it back up, simply to reset the dip switches, is too valuable relative to the cost of these things. Take my word for it, if you buy this you will be lucky if you don't wind up taking it back or throwing it out. It is a $40 piece of junk."
1,Wrong sizing,"I bought the X-large pack. It says for a dog up to 90lbs and 35"" waist. My dog is 77lbs and has a 28"" waist. The diaper doesn't fit at all. I had to cut it 2 inches down the back to get it to connect on the sides."
4,"Good replacement, just as good as any name brand.",Works as advertised... good quality. This was one of the first products I bought with Amazon and I've been hooked on buying through Amazon every since!
5,Hunter HEPA Filter pack,"This filter does a great job. I've had the filtring unit for quite some time now and I run it constantly. I don't have to change the filter that often either. It keeps my air clean. Also, I love buying on Amazon.com because my purchases are guaranteed by Amazon. You can't do any better than that!"
5,Probably works great,I never go a chance to use it. The unit for which I bought it is to small for the area in which I want to use it.
3,Too fast to follow,"I found this routine too fast to follow. There is not enough time to set up the tube for the various changes of exercises and I was constantly having to stop the video and restart it. Excellent instructor, but I would have liked it if the pace were slowed down and less intense so I could concentrate on the toning exercises. Disappointing because I think the tube is great!"
4,Great!,I love this resistance cord. You get results and it gives you a little something new to add to your FIRM collection!
4,Resistance cords,Not too bad! They are pretty good videos...I found once I knew the moves I could just watch t.v. and use my cord!
3,"Monarch of The Glen, series 6","We had enjoyed the original series and thought that the additional available series 5, 6 and 7 would be great. We were sadly disappointed with series 6 & 7."
4,Not enough cheerful Scots!,"I have been a fan of 'Monarch' for many years and still am. However, like many I prefer the earlier episodes. Why? Well, for me there are not enough cheerful Scots in the present series. At times 'Monarch' could be set in the Lake district! Lloyd Owen is excellent but he is very English both in accent and attitude, fair enough but the surrounding cast are universally mournful and the only one with any flair is Tom Baker, also English! Where is the enjoyable sparring of Hector and Kilwillie, the earthy attraction of Lexy, the sheer unbridled enthusiasm of Duncan? If a series is set in Scotland, particullarly one which plays up the romance of the Highlands, then lets have some tartan happiness and daftness and less English melancholy. The presence of Alexander Morton and Susan Hampshire ensure some continuity but the happy eccentricities of Hector, Duncan and Lexy are sorely missed. Still a wonderfully entertaining series but not as enjoyable."
5,The ONLY 20ft Cable,"I have a 2.5mm and a 3.5mm jack that a right next to each other, and i already had a 20ft 3.5mm jack, so i need a 2.5mm one that was the same length. I spent a LONG time searching but finally came across this one. It's the ONLY 20ft 2.5mm jack out there :) They really need to add some keywords for this thing so people can find it easily."
2,Beware if it breaks and where you bought it.,"Do not buy this from any 3rd party seller that is not a authorized Oreck dealer. When you do buy it save your receipt. My machine broke after just one year and can not be repaired under warranty although it has a 3 year warranty. Oreck is a un-organized and poorly run company beacuse after numerous phone calls they do not know where the product warranty registration/ records end up. I was told by Oreck employees ""I don't know where they go and we don't have the product registration here."" I other words do not waste your time to register the product because it serves no purpose later. You can not contact them via the internet and each phone call takes 20+ mins. I would think that since I regisrtered my machine on their website they would have records of it and know how old it is but they sure don't. I give it 2 stars only because when it works it works well."
1,Unfortunately I Bought Both Movies!!!,"I am a horror fan, but Hostel I & II are the worst movies I've ever seen!!! If I could Have given them a lower rating like a -100 I would have. Whoever made this flick and whose who rated this movie high need to be on a wanted list. Just GORE and PERVASION."
1,More of the same,"A disappointing rehash of the first movie, ""Hostel."" This sequel fails to recapture the originality of the first movie while desperately trying to out-gross it."
1,STUPID!,This is one stupid movie and I DID like the original HOSTEL. The original film was a good scare and quite realistic in most aspects. This one is beyond unbelivable. The script is terrible. The acting is okay but it's really tough to separate the acting from what they say(which is terrible). The ending of this idiot-fest takes the cake. IT MAKES NO SENSE AT ALL. I know this is a genre/slasher/torture film but COME-ON this is horribly stupid stuff. The original film is FAR superior. NOT RECOMMENDED.
3,LITTLE BIT DISAPOINTED,HOSTEL 2 IS NOT WHAT I EXPECTED FROM ELI ROTHIT HAPPENS IN THE SAME PLACE THAN HOSTEL 1 THE LITTLE KIDS ARE HERE FOR NO REASONS AT ALLIN HOSTEL 1 THE ATMOSPHERE THE SUSPENS THE CREEPY SCENES WAS VERY WELL MADE BUT IN HOSTEL 2 THERE IS NO SUSPENS AND I REALLY ASK MYSELF HOW CAN PEOPLE BE SO MEANTHERE IS A SCENE VERY BLOODY AND DISTURBING SO MUCH A GIRL ENJOY SO MUCH THE CRUAUTY I THINK ELI ROTH COULD HAVE MAKE BETTER MUCH BETTER AND I THINK IF THE MOVIE WAS WELL SITUED IN ANOTHER PLACE IT WOULD BE A GOOD ONE AND WHY IN THE BEGINNING WE SEE THE ONLY MEN WHO SURVIVE IN THE FIRST MOVIE AND THEN ???? FINISHOK SO IT IS HOSTEL 2 HOSTEL 1 WAS SO GOOD
2,Plain out bad!!!,"The first Hostel movie was really scary, suspensfull, and bloody. That's what any horror movie should have. But, Hostel part II failed in those aspects miserably. The 3 main characters didn't have to much personality and you just coulden't find yourself rooting for them. I really liked the reappearence of Jay Hernandez from the origional Hostel. But, after Jay's appearence was over, I found myself really bored throughout the rest of the movie. It's to bad that Hostel part II was a bad movie. The origional Hostel had the potential to spark a wide range of sequals. But with the failures of Hostel part II, I don't think that there will be any more Hostel movies. I hope my review was helpfull. Bye now."
3,Not as good as the first,"My title says it all. Story line gets a little played out, with some twists that don't really follow the feel of the first movie. Still bloody and fairly violent, so that helps in my book."
1,Waste of money,"this dvd is simply one long commercial for the tattletale marker. A bunch of worthless ""tips"" and no meaningful instruction. what a waste of money"
5,Japanese calligraphy / caligrafía japonesa,"Excellent book about Shodo, japanese art of calligraphy. Antique and Terayama sensei's pictures are superb, great election.Excelente libro sobre Shodo, el arte de la caligrafía japonesa. Las pinturas, tanto las antiguas como las del propio maestro Terayama, son increibles, una gran elección."
2,Worn Out,"I have worn the shoe 3 times and the bottom front is completely worn down. I work in an office that is fully carpeted walk 3 blocks to and from the train. Shoe looks good, left one is a little snug at first but loosens after one wear. I am not happy with the wear and tear this shoe can NOT take."
3,Its ok,Iv been going to EDC for 4 or so years and have been in the scene since 02. It was nice to relive some of the moments of EDC 2010 the last year they held it in LA at USC. I dont really know if it captured the full essence of the party for me. It was an interesting insight on what the DJ's thought about the party and the history of some of the people behind the masks but I got somewhat bored (and i was watching this on an airplane). I was actually hoping that EDC 2011 Vegas was in the video but it wasnt. It didnt get me hyped up for the next party like their commercials usually do. Still my favorite memory of that party was in the film. BALOONS DURING KASKADES SET!
4,Got To Disagree With Reviewer Below,"Despite the obvious pop crossovers, I prefered this one to G.O.A.T. overall. It was just better in my view. From ""Luv U Better"", ""Paradise"", ""Amazing"", ""Fa Ha"" and others. I even liked ""Lollipop"" for some reason! I agree the J-Lo crossover was a waste of time but LL's part is the only reason that song sold in my opinion because we all know that J-Lo can't really sing. So, for helping a fellow entertainer, I won't hold that against him!Overall, a strong CD. Not his best mind you but it is far from ""suck"" level."
3,"Not bad, not great","There was some excellent information in this article, but unfortunately, not all of it was correct. The author recommended use of the Davis system for remediating dyslexia, but for many people I know or have heard reports from, this very expensive approach has not produced any significant results. If you want to try the Davis system, make sure you talk to people who've used it."
2,Not a good sax stand.,"This stand does not hold properly the alto or tenor sax and it is not possible to adjust the bell holder, the bari holder does not protect the front bell as it does't has a cushion in that area and it has contact that with the time will tarnish or damage the instrument laquer, good price but not very protective..."
2,Not for me!,Sorry but just really don't care for this style although it does seem to hold the ipod classic fine. Just bulky on my waist. Will look for something else.
2,Not pleased,"My young African Grey had this toy torn apart in under a minute. The plastic cording used to hold it together is not strong enough to endure a beak of any decent size. I loved the parts - so I pieced it back together with leather stripping, but be aware, when you buy it, it is slick plastic strips holding it together, which doesn't hold for long. I realize this toy was probably meant for smaller birds, but if it only took my Grey less than a minute, I don't think it's going to keep any bird from tearing it apart very long."
3,Pretty good not for large parrots GREAT for small lovebirds,I got 2 of these one for my 2 lovebirds and 1 for my two sun conures the conures destroyed it in less than 4 days and the lovebirds LOVE this toy and pretty styrdy for them not for large parrots but good toy for small ones
2,Pretty cheap product,"This is a really low-budget product.In addition to the product being dented and partially non-functional on arrival, the manufacture quality appeared just plain cheap. Built-in speakers are smaller than they appear, and have a 60-cycle hum. Disc tray rattles and feels fragile. Remote control not ergonomic in design and not intuitive to use.On the other hand... it is the cheapest TV-DVD I've seen. It has the typical array of DVD outputs on the back so you can connect to your 5.1 audio system. By the way, this would be a good match with the $55 Durabrand 7-Piece Home Theater Audio System, HT-395 (...)"
1,APEX: actually not the epitome of great electronics,"I bought this TV a month ago and when it arrived the screen was tinted blue. You could hardly watch the TV because the blue tint was so heavy. Every time I called Apex customer service I was told I was number 15 or 16 in queue to talk to the next available representative. A 2 minute question left me on the phone for 45 minutes waiting for someone to talk to me. When I finally got a hold of someone, she seemed clueless. She told me, ""Um I guess you can send it back and we'll see what we can do"". So I carry my 33 pound TV down to the UPS store, and pay 35 dollars to ship it back. I am actually writing this while Apex has me on hold...still."
3,Great insight into the band but poor concert footage,"This video offers an interesting and slightly personal insight into the band. This is certainly refreshing and will appeal to diehard Skid Row fans.However, I bought this tape to watch the concert footage and was deeply disappointed. Firstly, the video and audio was mostly 'bootleg' quality except for the 3D video and the gig in Japan; it really does seem like someone shot the concerts off a camcorder. Secondly, several popular slow numbers like ""In a Darkened Room"", ""Wasted Time"" and ""I Remember You"" were missing.In short, get this video if you want to know the band a little better but do not bother if you're after good concert footage."
1,"A lot of Skid Row, maybe too much","This video clocks in at 2 hours, but to me it seemed longer. I couldn't sit through it all in one sitting. It's A LOT of Skid Row. Some good concert clips, a lot of home video that should only be entertaining to the band members and the die-hardest of fans, and a lot of singer Sebastian Bach acting like the mindless idiot he is (great singer, but dumb as a rock that guy). I'd say this is about 50% watchable and 50% nonsense. I like Skid Row, their first two albums I listen to frequently, but this Road Kill video is a little too much goofing around and not enough concert footage/music. I'd rather just watch a concert bootleg DVD of them in their prime. The ""behind the scenes"" footgae isn't interesting for the most part it's just them on the bus or acting stupid. Really it kind of shows that when not on stage with instruments in hand, the members of Skid Row aren't interesting at all."
3,Not real bright,"I think the real problem with this light is the LEDs themselves. The light was just not real illuminating. Granted the easy on/ easy off bracket is wonderful and the price is small, I wouldn't recommend this product for more than letting others know you are in the dark. They can see the light, but you can't see where you are going."
5,One of my favorite books,This book is one of my favorites of all time. I recommend it to everyone of all ages. It has a good story line and the sequels are excellent also.
1,"Kristin Chenoweth Shines, the rest is lack-luster","Disney, the studio I grew up with which used to produce wonderful entertainment, has been slipping slowly downward over the years, producing poor quality with only the name Disney to get by. This Music Man is no exception. Kristin Chenoweth, as always, is brilliant! But she sticks out like a sore thumb when up against the likes of Broderick's ho-hum Harold Hill who, by means of the song Trouble is supposed to convince the townfolk that something's amiss in River City. Unfortunately what's amiss is Hill himself. He is no salesman and after this particular redition of Trouble given by Broderick the townsfolk ought to have run him out of town and end the show right then and there.All thumbs down for this one!"
4,Correction,"I truly enjoyed this recording, but I simply wanted to point out that the editorial reviewer is incorrect: Broderick played the character of Leopold Bloom in The Producers. (Nathan Lane was cast exquisitely as his partner in crime, Max.)"
1,KRISTIN CHENOWETH ONLY GOOD PART OF THE CD,I own all 3 Music Man CD's and this cd is by far the worst album I own. KRISTIN CHENOWETH IS ABSOLUTELY AMAZING..... her co-star Matthew B. sucks completely he have no enthusiasm and is a very dull and boring Harold Hill.... Molly Shannon and the pick a little ladies are boring as well .. all and all this is a very very very disapointing CD... IF UR A KRISTIN CHENOWETH FAN THIS CD IS A MUST HAVE if not ITS NOT WORTH UR MONEY
2,"OK for laser theory, NOT for printer repair","This book is for understanding on how the laser printer works. Unfortunately a printer is very complicated mechanically and taking them apart is very tricky. This book is not practical. It doesn't emphasize typical mechanical and electrical assemblies that need repair and replacement due to wear and tear. Such as paper pickup rollers, fuser lamps, maint kits etc. It also doesn't have any disassembly procedures and exploded diagrams that will help you. There is no discussion on important printer options, such as ethernet print servers, PostScript, duplexers, power envelope feeders. I highly recommend getting a printer service manual for your specific model instead, for example a HP single model Service manual. They are often on eBay auctions and printerworks.com ."
3,Not a guide for practical laser printer repair,"Do not buy ""Easy Laser Printer Maintenance and Repair"" if you need a guide for quick access to laser printer components for their repair or replacement. The book is unnecessarily heavy in laser printer theory, soldering and test instruments, etc. -- information that is unnecessary for most technically savvy people. It may be, as one reviewer has suggested, a good text book for repair person certification. Example: while it identifies the high-voltage power supply as a common cause of failure and advises its replacement under readily identified symptoms, not one photo or verbal description tells you where this component is actually located on HP or Epson laser printers, or how to extract and replace it."
2,"This is a textbook, not a repair manua!","""Easy Laser Printer Maintenance and Repair"" started out as a textbook on electrophotographic technology. The title was obviously composed by the publisher's marketing staff. It is NOT a practical repair manual!"
2,Not useful with Comcast cable TV,"I have a Panasonic HD ready TV and depend on the basic Comcast cable for reception. The Samsung DTBH260F will only tune the network digital channels, which is what I bought it for, but it will not tune any of the non-digital stations. So it is not very useful if you have to switch back and forth to receive digital and non-digital broadcasts. The picture on these digital channels were not any better than what I got without the tuner. In fact, it was considerably lower in quality. You have to remember digital does not mean high definition. Don't buy this product if you think your HD ready TV will suddenly give you High Definition with this tuner. It does not, and you will get none of the regular non-digital cable TV channels. Wait for the technology to catch up and for the prices to come down. This receiver is not going to improve anything for your HD ready TV's and cable reception. Don't waste your time."
1,Just like Kelly I can't properly review this item,"My wait has been 17 weeks and I received my monthly email today pushing out the delivery date another 30 days. ONE BIG DIFFERENCE!!!! THE ITEM IS NOW LISTED AS AVAILABLE BUT FOR MORE MONEY THAN I AGREED TO PAY BACK IN NOVEMBER. IF THIS IS AMAZON'S WAY OF MAKING ME TAKE A WALK AND GIVE CIRCUIT CITY MY $$$, IT WORKED."
2,Not good if you don't have an HD TV,"I realize that this item is specifically geared towards HD TV's, but there are settings that allow you to use this converter with an ""analog"" TV. The only problem with not having an HDTV is that you will not be able to see the ON SCREEN DISPLAY (OSD) menu's thus making the device worthless.My goal was to reduce the additional cost that my cable provider (Time Warner) charges me per extra box ($11.00 per additional box). I figured that in two years I will have paid the equivalent of a new converter thus that's why I looked at this model.I already pay for premium channels and wanted to have my own box so that I wouldn't have to give the evil Time Warner more money they don't deserve. It didn't work. :(I have a friend who used to work for Time Warner and she told me that although it's legal to have your own converter, cable companies can lock down the devices one can use for their cable service. This means that any converter other than theirs will not work."
3,Review of Samsung Digital TV Tuner,This product was complicated to set up.The help desk finally gave up and told me to return it. The next one was still a challenge but I managed to get it operating. It seems to miss several of the channels that my new HDTV picks up with its built in tuner (using the same HDTV antenna).It doesn't work with the output set to 720p ( which is what my TV is) but only when set to 1080i.
3,Good but remote cumbersome,"I cancelled HD programming with my satellite provider and purchased this product to display HD on my Sony TV. Hookup and setup were very easy. My only complaint is the remote. The unit apparently has a narrow range of receiving signals from the remote, as you have to expertly aim the remote to get results. Guide use is somewhat slow.A useful product if your TV does not have a built-in tuner."
5,"Free off air HD, great product.","I live ~30 miles north of Boston & Needham, Ma (where ABC, NBC, CBS, and GBH antennas are located), and I'm getting 21 channels. For a recieving antenna, I have a $29 Radio Shack 75 mile HD antenna taped to a 2 X 4 on my back porch (an HD antenna is realy just the UHF portion of a standard VHF/UHF television antenna, wich is a lot smaller than the bulky VHF elements), I could probably get more channels If I get a $75 rotor and mount it outside.As other reviewers have stated, the Samsung's menu only appears on the component output, so if your TV does'nt have a component input, just connect the ""Y"" output to your TV's, or VCR's composite input to set the unit up. I'm using the S-video output for regular viewing on my cheapo Emerson 27"" ($180), wich is'nt a high def TV, but the digital signal is clean, no snow."
5,"IMHO, the best converter.","I bought smaller inexpensive converters to use with my two smaller TVs but for my large Sony HD-ready TV, I bought this unit and find that it is well worth the money; I am quite pleased.A caveat, though. Contrary to the common talk that plain old rabbit ears will work for all channels, I did have problems with a number of stations not having adequate signals. I resolved that issue by replacing my old (really old!) rabbit ears with a Winegard SS-3000 Amplified Indoor UHF/VHF Antenna (also from Amazon).The only downside to the Samsung unit that I found is that the remote will not control the on/off for the TV, a minor inconvenience. I'm looking into a universal remote that will handle both.If you are in the market for a higher-end unit, I highly recommend this unit."
4,Jersey Is A Gate Way For Punk,Jersey is probably the best new harcore sk8 punk band I'm the town punker and i think these guys are a wicked ... sounding band that sounds a little like rancid (My fav band) so pick up thte cd
3,Fair Punk,"A good punk album. A similar sound as Rancid. Though I'm not big on the girl's vocals in some of the songs, so i couldn't very well give it more than a 3. Not to mention they let her sing a whole song.. I saw them live recently, and they did the same song. It was far far better without the girl singing it. In my opinion anywho. Check it out. But i wouldn't recommend paying more than 10$ for this album. long live the underground and all its cheapo prices. bla"
3,ok,"This beef jerky is ok, but not like what you are probably used to. Its consistency is a little weird, it kind of falls apart in your mouth. It is kinda sweet too. It was ok, but I like regular jerky better."
5,jazz greats,"Ultra-hypnotic grooves; interweaving of diverse styles; a rollercoaster of emotions served up on an audible silver platter.With the downturn in American pop, there's never been a better opportunity to re-explore the true magic of jazz by ones who really know their stuff.Great jazz is this: it stimulates the mind, body and soul and takes you on a spiritual journey.It also rocks pretty ... hard!"
5,Outstanding..,"Monk ""the Master"" and Coltrane ""the Student"", by his own admission worked together for only a short time. The results were dynamic as Monk is solid Monk and Trane begins to improvise and stroll as only Trane could . This one makes you feel like you're right there in the ""Five Spot"" in 1957. Also hear Wilbur Ware and Shadow Wilson in some of the cuts. Oh, just to ice the cake Ira Gitler writes an excellent cover insert. This one is a must."
1,Is A tottalley RIP OFF of your money!!!!!!!!!!!,I bout this because I don't have cable and is a bad product because is a advertisement for people that have cable. THEY SHOULD worn people what it really is!
2,Larry King -The Greatest Interviews,"Interview for each person should be presented in its entirety for continuity of thought. The tape jumps from say Sinatra, to Clinton, to Johnny Cash, Bush, Reagan, Hilary, etc. etc..back and forth back and forth. The format does not make things interesting."
3,not great for miter saws,"I bought this as I needed a new blade for my 10"" sliding miter saw. It worked ok, but really not great. also seemed to dull fairly quickly compared to the other top blades I normally try to use (WWII or Tenryu) Probably better off using it in a table saw or RAS than a miter saw IMHO. But, my other blades were being sharpened and I needed something fairly quick, to just get me by for one job, which it did do."
4,GREAT THRILLER,i bought this book at my local book store a week ago and read in three days cause it was so good! it wasn't as scary as i thought it would be though but turned to to be very suprising and a great thriller. i recomend this book to everyother teenager outhere who loves thriller's.
2,ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ!!!,Wasn't scary at all. You knew who it was all along. He gave you one clue and kept on mentioning it which gave it all away. The only cool part was when Halley and her cousin got in huge fights where they almost killed each other.
5,Perfect idea book,"If you want ideas for your yard this is the book for you! Not allot of text, but many pictures of ideas. Each has a complete plant list with more details about the plants in the back. I found myself wishing for a larger yard with more room for all the ideas. Very good design, so much better then what the typical home owner would come up with."
1,miserable piece of junk,"i've been reading the manuals about 10 times and tried mirror itself under the bright sunlight. still can't figure out how to get the beam to the target. it says ""sight the rescuer through the view finder and at the same time rotate the mirror until the spot of light coming through the view finder becomes a bright round ring"". while i look at the target under the bright sunlight i can rotate the mirror until the latter day without any bright round rings. such things must be foolproof. i miss my old folded russian army resque mirror. it was user friendly and foolproof."
4,Very engaging,Picked this up for my 4 year old. It is longer than most books on tape/cd and the voices are very clear and engaging. You don't necessarily need the book to enjoy listening. Worth the money for car drives - I made a tape of the CD's we have and he listens on his walkman in the car.
5,"Reliable, easy to use","This controller is easy to program and easy to use. When my wife and I first moved into our condo, we were told by the management company that we could buy them from the gate servicing company or go out into the market and buy our own for about half the price. We picked up 2 of these and one of them is finally inoperable after 5 years (the light still works but the gate does not receive a signal). Definitely worth the $10 or so you can buy them for here on Amazon."
5,metal at its best,since the first time i heard the original strangers i knew that i would never hear a heavier live album schenker's guitar work is awesome this is a classic a must have for anyone who appreciates great guitar. Dont pass up this one the greatest live metal album of all time. Schenker kicks.
5,This is where to start...,"If you are new to UFO..., this is where you start your collection(you WILL buy more). Everyone has weighed in on the Michael Schenker saga and has their own opinion. This album can be reviewed very simply, it is the ""BEST OF"" the Schenker era pre Walk On Water.As everyone says, the playing on this set is incredible. Every song is tight and Schenker does indeed let loose with some jaw dropping guitar work.The thing that is remarkable about this album is the production and sound quality. The songs have much more energy and ""oompf"" than the studio versions. I have yet to come across a better sounding live recording, and remember when this was made.If you like pure engines open rock n roll - BUY THIS."
5,A LIVE ROCK MASTERPIECE,"THIS IS ONE OF THOSE ALBUMS THAT MAKE YOU FEEL GOOD ALL OVER. NOT ONLY IS IT ONE OF THE BEST LIVE ALBUMS EVER (NEXT TO FRAMPTON COMES ALIVE) BUT IT IS A PIECE OF WORK THAT NEVER GETS OLD. I THROW THIS CD INTO THE CHANGER EVERY COUPLE OF MONTHS AND LISTEN TO IT FOR A WEEK STRAIGHT AND AM ALWAYS AMAZED AT JUST HOW GREAT THAT THIS ALBUM IS. IT BLENDS EVERYTHING YOU EVER NEED TO HEAR IN AN ALBUM TO MAKE IT IRRESISTABLE. THIS ONE HAS IT ALL...GREAT SOUND, GREAT SOLOS, GREAT VOCALS, GREAT SONGS...IF I WAS TO PICK 10 ALBUMS TO HAVE WITH ME WHILE BEING STRANDED ON A DESERT ISLAND FOR 5 YEARS, THIS WOULD DEFINITELY BE ONE OF THEM!UFO REMAINS ONE OF THE GREAT UNDERRATED BANDS OF THEIR DAY...BEST TRACKS...ROCK BOTTOM, ONLY YOU CAN ROCK ME AND LIGHTS OUT"
5,Kudos to the Goom (Steve Goomas author of Keyboard Wisdom),"Steve has given us an exciting window on contemporary piano and keyboard playing. Concise and easy to read materials are presented directly so you can get your hands on a wide vocabulary of cool sounds right away enabling bothbeginners and more advanced to excel and make that vocabulary their very own.I know Steve to be a great player with a razor sharp mind and he has put his insights into this beautiful book that aims to lift hearts and minds into the worldsof Jazz/ pop/ rock/latin and country. I have chosen to use ""Keybaord Wisdom""in my own classes at the university level. I highly recommend Steve's tome of wisdom. It's what you need to begin your practice for real.Don CardozaPianist and instructor"
3,Great parts but way too long,"This police memoir started out as a riveting read, but ran out of gas a couple hundred pages into it. One story blended in with the next, with much too much repetition. It was too much ""the story of being a cop"" and not enough Conlon's personal story. He is quite a distant narrator, which made this hard to stay with. Still, the writing is good and I found it a very intersting inside look at the NYPD and the life of a cop. This needed a lot of editing, and more about the author's life. This book took patience to get through. In fact, I switched to the audio book about halfway through, so I could read another book, too. Overall, I'm glad I read this."
5,Rich story. Well told.,"This book is a terrific mix of real life cop drama, a history of New York and its storied police department, and a memoir of a young man that's made some unconventional choices in his life.As a small businessman I was struck by Mr. Conlon's description of the frustrations of bad supervisors. I don't know why it surprised me that large public bureaucracies would behave much in the same manner as large companies, but that is made perfectly clear. There is a leadership lesson here, and probably most surprising to Mr. Conlon, business value in the telling of his story.Mr. Conlon exemplifies all that we hope the police to be - committed, smart, caring people. My daughters have been taught to wave to the police because it's my hope that someone like Mr. Conlon is waving back."
4,Another winner from Britain's most consistent band,"As many of the other ""Britpop"" bands fade into irrelevance (Oasis) or go into semi-permanent hiatus (Blur), Supergrass continues to chime in every couple of years with uncomplicated splendor. Slightly more upbeat than their previous album, Life On Other Planets puts Supergrass back on familiar ground - solid three minute rock songs. Prophet 15 seems to borrow a bit too much from a particular Wings tune, but thats a minor blip."
2,Disappointing,"I read A Garden in Lucca just after finishing Spanish Lessons--a similar, but more interesting book by Derek Lambert. Paul Gervais writes in a style that merely skims the surface, never getting to the heart of either gardening or life in Tuscany. Garden descriptions are wordy with details that don't give any indication of the effect created. I also was disappointed that Gervais seemed to name-drop (and live) extensively in the ex-patriot community, rarely giving any insight into Tuscan life or culture. By contrast, Spanish Lessons, a novel about an English family's move to Spain, was so alive with insight into the experience of assimilating into a small town in Spain. Perhaps a true gardener would have found this book more interesting."
5,Some of the Best from the Best,"The latest release by an American Blues Icon- Elvin is the real thing, not a remade, re-mixed, re-hashed blues wanna-be. His original style of singing, guitar playing, and song writing are a refreshing change of pace from so much of the ""Blues"" released nowadays. Helluva sense of humor which is rare these days, plus some introspective songs. Elvin always has a great band and some great friends drop by to sit in!!Do yourself a favor and buy this CD- then, unless you've got a hole in your soul, you WILL buy more!!!"
5,Great Music,"Swank has unique talent and a new, great sound in this CD. Sellers is the greatest drummer since Gene Krupa."
1,Not Same As Picture,"By the picture, it looks to be a locking fuel door; that is not the case. If you are satisfied without a lock, great!"
3,historical snapshot,"Mary Borden was a wealthy American heiress who volunteered to fund and manage her own field hospital behind French lines on the Western Front. She was awarded the Croix de Guerre and made a Chevalier of the French Legion of Honour for her wartime service. She was obviously a well educated and literate writer and, while some of the short essays are a bit flowery, they are still very gripping. One can easily imagine the horrors she must have witnessed as thousands of wounded soldiers passed under her care over the four years of war. It's a short book but offers another unique perspective on that awful conflict."
3,Electric Guitar Heaven,"I guess the real question to ask is whether or not we need to hear Carlos Santana's classic material reinterpreted by other guitarists. If your answer is yes, this CD is heaven-sent. Ten giants of jazz, rock and blues guitar--including Pat Martino, Eric Gale, Mike Stern, Frank Gambale and Robben Ford--pay tribute to the superstar six-string slinger by putting their own distinctive individual stamps on ""Jingo,"" ""Oye Como Va,"" ""Blues for Salvador"" and more. Martino is the most subtle, planting a gorgeous ""Flor D'Luna (Moonflower)"" in the midst of a garden of mostly blazing hot licks, but Albert Lee throws a countryish Telecaster tone onto ""Samba Pa Ti"" that works very nicely. --Jim NewsomOriginally published in Port Folio Weekly, 1/9/07.Copyright 2007 Jim Newsom/Port Folio Weekly.

2,Very Difficult Reading for a Survivor,"This book is insightful, yet it proves to be difficult reading for a survivor dealing with the immediate loss of a loved one. The statistics come across cold and sometimes uncaring. It may be more suitable for a student of suicidology, than someone in pain seeking solace and validation."
5,Best Little Book in the World,"The absolute best children's book in the world. Since I lost my childhood copy, I just had to order one for my 2year old and she loves it just as much as I did. I think it's a good book to teach about behavior when parents are away.The kitchen scene is hilarious, the bubble scene is adorable, if you don't have a copy for your kid, then get it!!!"
1,"Very old, feeble, slow","Beware--- they shipped me a v5 version of this product that isfour years old. It has known security issues, there are no updateddrivers, and the signal strength on one of Linksys's own G-routersis very low where other G-adapters have excellent signal. Insist onknowing the version number of the product, and, look it up beforepurchasing."
3,Problems,The installation took a lot of time and frequent needs for attention. It seems to work to the extent of getting me into a public and open wireless in the building but could not get any internet access. I have had my MAC Power Book in the oiffice occasionally and it worked from start up on the same access.
2,Lolita thief,"Nothing in this book is really original, unless you count the sick fetishes like eating scabs. If you want to read the best book on pedophiles, read Lolita. It will make you cry and puke at the same time. The End of Alice will only make you do the latter. One of the flaws is the excessive introspection by the main character. Unlike Humbert Humbert, he's just too charmless and pathetic to derive any sympathy from readers. At the end, I didn't really identify with him. I could have gotten a better story from Penthouse Forum."
2,Product of a Childish Mind,"It's a childish book. As I made my way through all the vomit, semen, bowel movements, scabs, etc., I was reminded of how scandalized children are by bodily secretions, and yet how thrilling they find it all too. You keep hoping you'll find at least an occasional moment of wit among the secretions (a la Swift in Gulliver's Travels), but they just keep pouring forth, monotonously. This is how A.M. Homes ""shocks"": not with ideas but with snot and pus."
2,This is an awful book,"AM Homes is obviously not a paedophile, nor in jail, nor (especially) a man, facts made obvious as our main character sounds like a mushy woman. I went in expecting Burroughs, came out bored. There was no shock, no moral revulsion, because though the events recounted were horrible, each character remains profoundly moral. I wish Ms. Homes had the guts to turn this into an objective examination of sick things, but instead it was badly tainted with the story of Shechem - like didacticness, Billy Graham could just as well have written this. What does anyone and everyone see in Ms. Homes?"
3,"Disturbing,YES.But is it really necessary?","This is without a doubt the strangest book I have read.The plot is not really new although it is a shock to most.I found it interesting in many parts,but they just got going and it was on to a new segment.It just seemed to jump around a bit too much for my liking.Having said that,I can't think of any other way the story could have been told.This still does not answer the question I had very early in the book.Does this story need to be told"
2,Phone Charger,"Although, the product was compatible with my phone, and the cost for this product was a bargain I guess you get what you pay for, I had this for less than a month and after about 2.5 weeks of use the product no longer functions.For the price you pay, you can get a limited use of the product, a disposable kind of product..."
1,A Cheap Piece of Crap,"I bought this to replace my original charger that came with my Palm Centro. This charger broke after just the second use. The prongs broke off into my phone and I had to use jewelry design pliers just to remove the piece that broke off. Since I didn't pay much for it, I didn't bother to return it. My husband picked me up a much better replacement charger for just a few bucks more. I recommend you shop around and get something worth your money."
5,Works for me,"I need a charger for travel and my previous one had issues with the copper loops. When it finally lost all connection in my Treo, I started looking for a replacement. The prices ran the gamut but they all looked the same. I liked the price on this one and ordered it. Delivery was quick and the product works fine. I consider this a good purchase."
5,Essential Reading for Serious C++ Programmers,"Templates and the Standard Template Library (STL) are some of the strongest features of C++, and this book gives a very clear explanation of the STL. Not only does Mr. Josuttis lay out the interfaces and behaviors of the elements that make up the STL, but he gives insight into which abstract data types and algorithms are better suited for a given task. As a long-time C programmer who recently began working in C++, I was able to pick up on the power of the STL in a very short period of time using this book, and significantly shortened my development time by not having to re-invent the wheel (again).The bottom line is that this book has permanent place in my ""arm's reach"" documentation set. This is the book you want if you are doing anything with the STL."
1,The Kindle edition is terrible,"Don't get me wrong. Content-wise, this book is indispensable. However, the Kindle edition is almost unusable. The contents of the book are all displayed using a single proportional font, and it appears that most of the formatting for the source code is lost. As a result, you find that you have source code getting lost in the middle of text, incomprehensible pieces of code where things are spread over two or three lines, and just plain messiness all around. The loss of formatting of the source code makes this edition of the book almost useless for the purpose of reference. I am afraid that this is a problem we will be seeing for most ebooks for a long time, and it is rather depressing. In short, I can't recommend this book in electronic form. Go ahead and bite the bullet and just haul the regular one around."
1,YIKES....I ONLY HAVE TWO WORDS....,"DON'T BUY. O.k. I have a few more...this thing crashed more than a drunk pilot. It lagged and locked up on me so many times i'm going cross-eyed. I liked version 5 deluxe a heckuvalot better than this. I was warned about 6 so i stayed away. I wish i were warned about this one. Give this vampire the old wooden stake! DEFINITELY buy 5 over 6 or 7. Or just stay away and find a nice sonic foundry program. They cost a whole lot more...but if you can afford it...get it.If not, look around for magix music studio 5 deluxe. You won't be sorry."
2,A beg old MEH,"So let me say this......they do exactly what they say they will do.....However, when you consider that most of the time you are making cupcakes to take somewhere or give to someone.....sure you might want to take the ""wrapper"" off of it, but realistically, the wrapper goes a hell of a long way to making it easier to handle when putting the frosting on.So great idea, but practically speaking....unless you want 12 perfect brownies at your house that you would never worry about loosing the thing you baked them in....this is just one more thing taking up space in my crowded kitchen."
3,kind of noisy,"We installed this ceiling fan in a hallway and I don't know if it's because it's a hallway or what but it's rather noisy. Our initial idea was to have the fan run often to better circulate the air back to the bedrooms. However, we hardly have it on now because the noise is annoying."
4,Westinghouse 78248 Turbo Swirl Single-Light 30-Inch 6 Blade Fan,"Ordered 2 of the subject items, installed one into one of our guess bed rooms. Works & looks very well, not to mention the ease of installation (just follow the directions if you are not mechanically in depth). With old fan removal + assembly & installation took less than 90 minutes. If you have a room that's 10X10 - 12X12 this will work wonderfully, mind you these are not for cooling a room just air circulation."
1,Garbage!,"This product is awful. It didn't work on my cyanobacteria, they just came back a few days after I used this and did a water change. It also killed an anemone in my tank and damaged some of my corals. Don't use this trash!"
2,Sagan's Calculus of Variations,I really couldn't get into this book. And I tried others and they weren't much better. This just must be a tough subject to write about. It comes across as an applied analysis text at the 1st year graduate level. the problems are sometimes hard to decode; once you know what he's asking they don't take much time. but it's tough to figure out what he's asking.i'll keep looking.
2,Great for Montessori Philosophy,"This is all based around a montessori style educational philosophy. If you are into that, then this is a great resource for you. Unfortunately, I've been teaching way too long to find this effective."
2,Not the best book to start with......,"I think anyone considering this as a starting point is way off.I am a partner of a survivor. There are three books which I have read at this point. ""What about me"" and ""Allies in healing"". I feel that these latter two were the books which I gained the most from.This book is very clinical in it's approach.Great for a threrapist. Not good for the reader. The other two mentioned come from a much more human place. ""Me?"" is written by the partner of a survivor, ""Allies"" by an authority on the subject and a survivor herself. Do yourself a favor, start with one of the other two, then come back to this one. After all, it is all about arming ourselves with info isn't it? Read them all, just read this one last."
3,CAP Barbell Olympic Plate Rack,"This item was cheap via Amazon.com. I built the rack in less than 10 minutes using a wrench and the supplied Allen key. The rack seems cheaply built and is a bid wobbly, but I suppose you get what you pay for sometimes! I just hope it doesn't fall apart under weight."
2,Missing parts,Item came without nuts and bolts for assembly. I'm going to have to purchase the nuts and bolts separately. Cannot comment on stability nor usability of item until fully assembled.
5,Wonderful!!!!,"Great voice, great tunes. Claypool writes beautifully, sings beautifully. LOVED ""Yellow Rose"" - lyrics and melody brought tears to my eyes. LAUGHED at ""She Kicked My Dog"". I can't stop playing this CD.-Patty"
2,NOT CORDLESS,"I purchased this warming tray a year ago and have used it about once a week over the past year. The tray appears to be cordless in its picture and the tray showed up when I searched for ""cordless warming tray,"" but the tray IS NOT CORDLESS. It must be plugged in to stay warm. It remains warm for several minutes after it's unplugged, but not long enough to get through a meal and there's no way to disconnect the cord. In all other respects, it's a good warming tray -- it gets as hot as you could want, and the heating surface is large (the tray is too big to put in the middle of our table though)."
2,I like the idea but the implementation is not great,I was really excited about this as an anchor point. The shackle that came with the insert is too tight to fit over the bar to bolt the thing together. I am going to have to find another shackle to make this all work. That is an annoyance. The long and short if it is that the quality is low enough where it does not work as shipped.
2,Biolene Free,These pills did not do anything for me. I would not recommend them to anyone. i did just as well without them.
4,A different History of Jerusalem,"Written by a former deputy mayor of Jerusalem, this historical account looks at the last 150 years of Jerusalem's history in the context of reaching a peaceful solution to this divided city. Though written from the Israeli point of view, the book delicately handles issues of institutionalized discrimination against the city's Arab inhabitants and their national aspirations, often accurately representing the Arab side of the story on equal terms. The book excels in exposing the problems the city faces under Israeli rule. It also decisively critiques the myriad ""solutions"" to the city's problems and explains why they are unworkable. Where the book fails is in suggesting a workable solution. Written in the latter 1990s, the book seems to attach an unreasonable hope on the Oslo peace process, which as we know now, ended in failure. Still, this is a must-read book for anyone wishing to understand the complexity of the issues surrounding the Holy City."
3,Certainly Interesting,This is an interesting perspective of the Israeli/Palestinian conflict. I only wish the author hadn't tried to hide an all to apparent bias. It made some of his arguments difficult to swallow. I would have rather disagreed with him rather than wondered what he was trying to say without saying it.
3,WICKED IN MIND,"This book is about one man who decides to stay single and enjoy sex with as many women as possible, with some of the women aware of his position, and some not. If you think, from the title, WICKED IN BED will give you long, drawn out erotic bedroom scenes, this will not be what you expect. This book is more about the wickedness of the man than about actual liaisons. It's a reminder that these type men do exist. The most unusual thing about the novel is that it's written by a woman, but it gives real insight into the ""dog"" in one man. It's a relatively short book and a fast read. The ending was abrupt and left many unanswered questions. Finally, there was a brief epilogue which wasn't much help either."
3,Post-op Shoes sized wrong,The shoes were larger than what I expected for mens' medium.I returned them and got a refund. The company did not replyto my email. There was no offer for a smaller size.
1,All the music sounds the same on this album.,"All the music sounds the same on this album. There isn't a whole lot of variety to it. It's pretty lame and boring. Why couldn't there been a better flow for the music's arrangement. If you're looking for a better alternative, I would try ""Ultra Dance 2 - w/DJ Encore"" or DJ Skribble."
2,pulp ufo trash,"If you want a real difinitive study of the whole UFO phenomenon, look elsewhere. This is merely a collection of first, second, and third-hand accounts of sightings and such. Unfortunately, these kinds of books churn out every 6 months or so, and we all buy it thinking that we will catch a unique glimpse of some inner understanding into the UFO field. But, unfortunately, we are only left with a sad paperback that has gotten us no closer to the truth, yet has cost us $8 for a book we will never read again. If you like the kind of books that Brad Steiger puts out, then this should be right up your alley."
1,Poor Ears....,"If the ear plugs were more comfortable, it might help but the sound quality is in the ""Tinny"" range and difficult to separate what you want to hear. Should have a sound discrimination control... For the price, what did I expect???"
1,This product is a piece of junk!,"This product is really a piece of junk! It picks up EVERY sound in the room. It can not differentiate between sounds you want and don't want. it makes horrible scratchy/static sounds, you can hear yourself speak, chew, breathe...it pretty much amplifies everything LOUDLY! You cannot even move while you are using it...if you accidently move it or touch it...the volume of that sound scares you to death! In addition to all of the above, the quality of the sound is tinny and very poor. THIS IS A WASTE OF TIME & MONEY! Please take my word for it and don't bother, because you'll end up having to go thru the inconvenience of returning it."
2,Disappointed,I bought this for my grandfather and he did not use it too much. The quality of sound is not what I was hoping for or what you would expect. Muffled and more annoying than helpful
1,Forget it!,"-It does not work as advertised-Too much static to hear anything you'd actually be interested in hearing-Static and background noises drown out the TVDon't waste your money, this is a bad product."
1,stay away,"alot of backround noise, seems to amplify high frequency better (more). Batteries need replacing once a day. headphone jack were very touchy from the start and now a week later the whole thing does not work at all.very dissappointing."
1,Sonic Earz,"This product has a lot of feedback, in fact all you hear mostly is your fingers on the case. Sound is poor quality. I am surprised that Bell & Howell put their name on this product. The ear buds also hurt your ears( at least they did mine!). This is money wasted on a sub-standard product. Amazon's quality control should check these products before they allow them to be sold. I like Amazon but they goofed up this time!"
2,You get what you pay for,This amplifier is very inexpensive and does about what you'd expect from a cheap condenser mic. It's useless in a room with lots of people talking; you'll just hear noise.
1,Too many error messages. No product support,"I purchased this product about a week ago and had to return it. First of all the company wants to charge me... to talk to tech support regarding several error messages that I was getting.... P>I disabled ""Norton Anti Virus"" and ""GoBack"" and still get an error message. I finally e-mailed their tech support, and they indicated to me that I need to contact Compaq to help me disable some softwares in the BIOS.Well folks, this is supposedly an easy software to deal with. Guess what...it is not.You can't back up to an external FireWire or USB drive and if you want to back up a 20 gig drive you'll need about 35 CD-R/W disks. What if my whole hard drive freezes or crashes, what good does it do me to do an image on that same drive...."
2,still works thank god,"the product came in a box that looked more like a basketball that was stuffed into a real box. All the platsic pieces are broken, but it still works. How someone could pick up that box and think its okay to ship is beyond me. I have had a master flow before and its a good product, i am just glad it works, but who ever shipped it should be re-trained or dismissed."
4,"Great pump, solid construction.","This pump is very solid. Mostly metal construction, comes with a nice storage bag so it stows neatly in the trunk of my car. It works very well and is relatively quiet. I don't think it's quite as fast as other reviews claim. The built in air pressure gauge is also VERY inaccurate. I have to pump it to about 45 psi on the pump gauge to get 32 psi on my higher quality tire gauge ($20 gauge). Takes about a minute or two to get my tires from 25psi to 32 psi."
2,bamboozled,"TOO MUCH EMPHASIS ON MAYA'S ""BI-RACIAL"" BACKGROUND. IT'S ALMOST AS IF HAVING ""EXOTIC"" AND NOT TYPICAL ""AFRICAN FEATURES"" IS WHAT THE AUTHOR FEELS MAKE THIS WOMAN ATTRACTIVE. I AM DEEPLY OFFENDED AS ALL ""AFRICAN APPEARING"" FEMALES SHOULD BE."
3,"Enjoyed the story, rather sweet","Sweet story, not my first interracial novel but it won't be my last either, Looking forward to reading Ms Glass other novels.I did like the twist in the story and if Nick was real I would date him myself- lol"
2,Can't picture myself as the leading lady,"Maybe it's just me, but whenever I'm reading an interracial romance, I like to be able picture myself as the leading lady. In this book, not at all. Based of the cover, I thought the leading lady was a medium tone black woman. The books saids different. The leading lady is biracial, Blasian. I strongly prefer to read a romance about someone who sort of looks like me; but I don't have a problem reading books about biracial women, or just any woman. But the thing with the book, the author was constantly mentioning reminding you how she was mixed with Vietnese. Like every few pages or so. Like I said, I like be able to pretend I'm the character, but it was very hard with this book. The book, the leading man said she looked black, but from the description of her, she looked more Asian. Light skinned (no kind of brown to her color), light eyes, straight hair, etc."
5,My Raza Professor,"A very good book by a very good professor I had in Raza Studies. I won't give his name or what school out of respect, but I could relate to his life in many ways. It was a struggle most of us Chicano/Latinos can relate to. When you read about his life you will reflect on yours. Thanks!! Benito A. Romero."
2,10 Lb. Digital Postal Scale,"I have not used this scale much so am still not sure how accurate it is. I weighed an item today and took it to the post office and it was 1 oz. heavier at the post office. I have only used the battery so want to test the scale for accuracy when using the cord. Also, when weighing a large item you cannot see the read out."
1,Terrible,$14.99 Kindle Edition for 'Buffy the Vampire Slayer'?? Not in this lifetime. Greedy publishers at their best. And for Buffy no less...unbelievable.
4,Great Deal,This was a movie my Mom wanted... I was surprised to find it for her and the price was great...You have to be a Liza fan to really enjoy it ...
3,cute movie,"The movie is not an academy award winner but it is cute and sweet and a little funny in places. I think some of Liza's acting is a little over the top but the other characters are pretty well defined. I bought the movie only because it is about an adult tap class full of misfits who bring it together nicely in the end. As an ancient adult misfit tapper myself, I related to some of the characters and felt a little motivated to keep trying after watching them. Otherwise I would rent instead of buy (if you can find it) It is not available in DVD and many of us no longer have VHS players. I shared it with some others in my tap class and they got a kick out of it."
1,exclente servicio,"Excelente producto, funciona muy bien, sobre todo lo he usado con mi camara profesional."
1,Its pretty small for a grammys cd isn't it?!,I have one thing to say - Where's BON JOVI!?! These guys deserve more recognition - seriously...
1,Where's No Doubt?? They WON!,"This grammy CD is bogus.No Doubt is not featured.The Grammy's are starting to be more like ""The CD Sales Awards"".And WHY is Vanessa Carlton anywhere near the Grammy's?Skip this and Buy ""Rock Steady"" by No Doubt,that SHOULD have won best album of the year."
1,18 tracks on a CD for 2003 Grammys,Here's my question how can they have a CD for the 2003 Grammys with only one CD? Hello it could have been at least two CDs I know just like everyone else knows there are more than those aritst with good music that were nominees. I like almost all of those that are on the CD but there's no Hip Hop no R&B no Soul at all I give everyone there props but my opinion there should be a second ablumn.
4,music,"Allison Krauss has a really amazing voice and sound. Good band. Easy listening, easy humming and easy to sing along."
5,I've Got That Old Feeling by Allison Krauss,We have almost all of Allison's albums. This one fits right in with the others. Great songs as only Allison can do them
2,Not the highest quality,"The first time I put this in the CD player, I got an error message. And the 2nd time. Eventually it played. I still get error messages regularly, although it will eventually play. The CD came out of the shrink wrap with a couple of scratchs on it, and when compared with other CDs, it obviously is not of the same quality. Once it plays, it plays fine. There are 20 tracks, with odd numbered tracks have a singer sing the songs, and the following even numbered tracks the instrumental."
5,Another great Astro City story,"Excellent work by Kurt Busiek and Brent Anderson. This story comes from the point-of-view of a super-villain who really aspires to be a hero. As good a ""real life"" look as the previous stories. You will root for the ""bad guy""."
3,Good compressor - lousy hose,"After using the compressor successfully half a dozen times over a year or so, and with a trailer tire about 20% low, the cheap plastic coiled hose ""crimped"" and split. We were camping a long way from any heavy duty pump; had to drive about 10 highway miles on an 80% inflated trailer tire before we found a 100+PSI compressor. Toss the cheap hose and fittings and replace it with a good 1/4"" rubber hose and traditional fittings - avoid the aggravation of being without at a critical time (""Murphy's Law"")."
3,Works great when its working,"I purchased it as an alternative to firing up my medium or large sized compressors to seasonally adjust the tire pressure on our cars and my motorcycle. Almost immediately, I had to replace the gauge, and I can't count on both hands how many fuses I have replaced even though I have taken the unit apart and checked the soldering (which appears acceptable) and only have it running long enough to ""top-off"" my tires, vice fully inflate them. If I leave it running, vice shut it off each time between attaching the hose for each of the four tires, it can do all four but gets so hot, I think it could melt the plastic and rubber, so instead, I shut it off and use a lot of fuses."
4,Nice compressor for $60,"I purchased mine for $59 about 2-years ago and it has been invaluable. However, there is no way that I would pay $82 for it.I have seen reviews talking about a need to change the quick connect fitting in the head. That is NOT necessary. The matching coupler is readily available at Harbor Freight. You will need a new coiled hose and a decent tire valve adapter (that screw-on one will drive you nuts).This compressor is a work horse for a 12V, 30A compressor. Like ANY small compressor, the higher the pressure is in the tire (or whatever) the longer it takes to fill. It does help to attach it to the vehicles battery and have the engine running (to increase voltage). I have 65PSI 15"" tires on my trailer and this compressor fills them to 65# in a reasonable amount of time. Just don't expect it to act like a 110V compressor that has a tanks pre-filled to 120PSI."
5,A Magical Tale By A Master Storyteller,"The Coelura is another wonderful tale by an imaginative writer. It is a brief, original tale about a gutsy and likeable heroine who lives on a futuristic world. It also contains the unique Coelura, sentient beings who I wish truly existed. An unexpected but welcome bonus are the illustrations throughout the story by Ned Dameron in the 1987 Tor Book paperback I have. His highly imaginative drawings enhance the story and bring it even more to life. Although the book does not take long to read, the time spent reading it is thoroughly enjoyable. Readers who love the fantasy genre will not be disappointed."
4,Fun for all ages,"This gift turned out to be a favorite this year, with parents and children alike. My four, six, and nine year old children really love it, and my husband and I both compete long after the kids are in bed! Very durable, as my hubby is about 20 lbs. over the weight limit of 180 lbs.My only complaint is that the video ""snowboarders"" do say things like ""Take that Sucka!"" and ""That's SICK"" (which apparently means ""cool"" in today's resorts) I'd rather not have these two phrases bursting from my sweet childrens' mouths, but we just mute it, so it wasn't hard to fix.Great toy- great fun!"
4,Very good.,"This toy is very fun,my cousin bought one for me for my birthday.There are only a few things wrong with this toy.Pros.1.Cool characters.2.Alot of stunts.3.Easy to hook up to the tv.Cons.1.You can only steer with the back of the board.2.Not enough characters.3.No racing.4.Not enough courses.So this is a pretty good toy,thanks for buying it cuzz.Review by Trey.Toy bought by my cousin Ryan."
3,"Enjoyable, but lacks convincing suspense","""Off and Running"" is a quick read with pleasant characters and vignettes, but although the central event--the election for student body president--should quicken the pulse, it fails to. Everyone is just too nice. Miata, the very serious girl, is portrayed fairly realistically, as are her modest goals if she should be elected (sprucing up the school, creating a ""lake of flowers"" around it). Her opponent, Rudy, is a buffoon, but not a nasty one, which is not so realistic. No one gets hurt very much, and there are no hard feelings, which, given the intensity of children's emotions, is a little hard to believe. If only it were so simple! Of particular interest is Miata's desire to connect to older, successful politicians, to learn from them.No child will have nightmares from having read this book, and it's possible that it might inspire a little desirable imitation. It's not demanding and will help children maintain reading skills during the summer."
2,Attention Professors thinking about assigning this text!,This book is very expensive! I had to buy this book for a course and I hated it. Some of the sentences are 75 words long. I'm totally serious about that. The author speaks an intellectual language that is hard to understand. I hated reading it. The author could have said what he needed to say in about a quarter of the space. Please don't subject your students to this book. There has got to be better (and cheaper) textbooks about career counseling out there.
2,Lotus pillar Holder,Very pretty but was not large enough to hold the pillar candles I wanted it to hold. Had I been able to see it somewhere i would not have bought it.
3,Good... but not a Broadway Style,"Bryn and Renee are two of the top 10 opera singers in the world, but they find it very difficult (especially Renee) to have sing in a musical-theatre style. They sing everything very square, and when they don't, the phrasing is often times irregular. Good CD, but not a must have."
2,Disappointing,"I'm a Broadway music fan rather than an opera fan but was intrigued by some of the song choices and didn't hesitate a moment to order this. Fans of songs such as Wheels of a Dream and All the Wasted Time should buy the cast albums of Ragtime and Parade, respectively, or the ""Broadway in Love"" CD, a lovely compilation. Renee massacres many of her lines. All the Wasted Time is not even done as a duet -- and it's a freakin' duet album. Very underwhelming stuff."
1,Believing In Jesus: A Popular Overview of the Catholic Faith,"Not very useful for RCIA classes. Very ""Protestanty"". I would recommend the New Adult Cathechism which is far, far better."
1,Short on moral issues of the day,"Fr.Foley has written a book that does not tackle moral issues from a Catholic perspective. He does not fully support Humanae Vitae, giving the choice to his readers to commit a mortal sin if they really believe contraception is okay. Used in our RCIA program but should be replaced by the CCC."
1,Useless product,"I purchased two canisters of this product and the results were nonexistent. If you have a dog urine problem, tear up your carpet and DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS STUFF! I followed the directions to the letter and it did nothing!"
5,Oster Pro-cord trimmer,"It's quiet and powerful. great for doing my small dog around the eyes, feet and tail."
1,Grill Brush,"Not what I was expecting. My fault for not realizing it was only 10.5 inches long, but still not worth the 5 dollars I spent. The bristles are very soft and I don't really know what kind of grill you would use this on. Even if you used it on a little hibachi grill, it wouldn't last very long. Also, whoever delivered it just left it on top of our mailboxes on a Sunday! I saw it as I was driving by, but didn't know it was mine, when I got home a neighbor had put it on my doorstep. I do not recommend this brush, it is too short and the bristles are too soft."
4,Good but not great,"If the grill is hot when you use this brush, the plastic holding the bristles will melt and the bristles will slowly fall out. Thus, I am buying a replacement brush now. Still, it does work and the price is right."
3,not bad for the price,get what you pay for.. .really dont have any complaints so far but only have used this product once. good for the price... a good Brush for your grill not a scraper
5,happy customer,"Very happy with lower and upper radiator hoses .Only thing I placed one order for both hoses ,but top hose arrived ten days before bottom hose,not that it matters I only thought it would have been more cost efficient in one parcel"
1,Bike Pedal Snapped off and injured my son,"My son was so excited to receive this bike. He was standing on his bikes pedals and his pedal snapped off and ripped his leg down the shin, 40 stitches. Anyone else with this bike injurys should email me at [...]"
3,Rawlings makes us roar,"In a technologically advanced age where love, loyalty and the desire to embark on an adventurous odyssey have become increasingly complex, could a story about a woman in ancient Greece make a difference? Could Jane Rawlings' ""The Penelopeia,"" enlighten our mundane reality--a reality thatrefuses to ask if. ""The Penelopeia"" refuses to celebrate the power of human imagination before exposing its artificial sensibility. Its crisp and unabashedly simple narrative, packed with menace, intrigue and pulse-beating twists, invites one question: is passion indeed the unacknowledged legislator of the truth? Rawlings' understanding of our thirst for adventureand raw passion makes us roar; even Plato would have approved Rawlings' dignified Chutzpah."
1,falsely advertised,"Don't misunderstand - the album is great, which is why I purchased it. However, it is clearly one of Amazon's burn-on-demand CDs, and was not advertised as such. So, it doesn't work in some players. Frankly, if I wanted a burned copy, I would have burned a copy and not paid Amazon full price for the privilege. Let the buyer beware!"
2,Dig His flow but not all the Guests&can't stand Jay Z,I think Freeway&Beanie Sigel are the Best Rappers easily on Roc A fella&Blow Jay Z out of the Water to me.but He gets the Catchy material that gets over&they usually get the left-overs as is the case with alot of these tracks.He has some solid moments but way to many Guests clutter up a MC with a Promising future to me.save that Log Jam for Jay Z so He can be hidden with His same ole tired flows&raps but Cats like Freeway&Beanie don't need to be Hidden with there flows.
1,Just Blaze did a great job on this one!!,"It's a good album, but way too many guests (only one song where he hold it down by himself).The best songs are What we do ft. Jay-Z & B. Sigel, Flipside ft. Peedi Crakk & off course the bonus track Line Em up ft. Young Chris.....Freeway is way better on all the mixtape & compilation s**t but it's still a very good album."
3,Smart Man,Free did the smart thing with all the guest apperances his voice is just to annoying to endure for a whole album by himself. Don't get me wrong his skills are on point but that voice has got to go..
2,jay-z is still all roca's got,"i bought this cd cause i heard jay-z finally found some good talent.... but freeway is just like memphis bleek, he's great for a feature but not good enough to be solo."
3,Freeway,"A good cd overall. You may have to skip a couple of songs but there are at least 7 solid songs. Just Blaze keep the hot tracks coming as usual. Jay, Beans ,and State Property also appear on the cd"
4,good textbook,"Glad I found this book. It's thorough without being overwhelming to a new learner, and will be an important addition to my library!"
5,A Book For Readers,"This book was very good, so well-written, and very moving. The setting (1968 in an enormous 1700s house isolated on a large tract of land in Salem, Massachusets) was perfect for the isolated, turbulent family and the scary plot. Alcoholism, gambling-ism, adultery--they're all here, and also here is a smart, kind, caring child named Trisha. She is like a symbol of hope, not just for the family, but for the country, for humanity. I really enjoyed reading this book, and was really sad when I realized I was nearing the end. Recommended highly!"
1,Dime Store Decorating,"This is a book that you check out from the library, not one that you purchase. Everything seemed skimpy to me, from the pictures to the text. Also, beware of another of the author's books, Fabulous Flea Market Finds. The cover is different and it has a different title, but from cover-to-cover it is the exact same book! I had no idea that you could just change the title of a book and sell it."
4,"Yes, But what will he say on the DVD?","Rumor-mill has it that Laurent Bouzereau will be given a commentary track on the soon to be made Episode One DVD, let us hope he offers up the same insight and humor found in this written edition."
3,Making of Episode seems Lucas driven,"If you don't mind wading through what seems to be Lucas'self-promotion through the writers of this book, the ""Star Wars:The Making of Episode 1, The Phantom Menace"" is an OK edition to your Sci-Fi collection.Authors Laurent Bouzereau and Jody Duncan do a great job detailing the production of the movie, but their writing is bogged down with Lucas worshipping, which paints the production of the movie as nearly flawless and all involved in the making of the movie as near gods. The writing appears to be driven by Lucas himself, who seems to be overly concerned about the image he projects.But lovers of the movie will find this book enticing nontheless, because of the masterful artwork and production details on many of the technological filmmaking breakthroughs -- most notably the rampant use of digitization to create new worlds in the film. Those details alone, make this book a moderate winner in the nonfiction ""how it was done"" books. END"
3,It's allright.,"This is a pretty good book because it offers candid views of the production of the movie like you would expect it to, but there is very little talk of the characters in the movie, especially Anakin Skywalker, Queen Amidala, Padme Naberrie, Jar Jar Binks, Darth Maul, Darth Sidious, and others. There was little on their background story that would have shed light on the movie plot. Also, little was said how props for the movie were made so quickly. But the book has excellent photos and is readable."
2,Badly overrated,"This is essentially a watch-once presentation. It's a see-the-sights tour. Easy to imagine a seller of magic cure-all 'medicine' at a carnival in 1890. ""See it all! See where grisly murders happened! See how they did it! Come one, come all!"" Best to try and catch this on TV."
3,"Good, could be better","I took a graduate level class with this as the textbook. It is a great reference and does a good job explaining regulations. The problems and the examples need to be more clear. I guess what I'm saying is the complex problems, such as oxidation-reduction reactions, are explained too briefly. Other than that, I enjoyed using the book for the class."
3,"Ok, but nothing extra","Current price does not correspond to the quality level of the book if one compare it other literature in Chemistry. It is ok, though, especially if one haven't read any chemistry prior to this book and at the same time focuses on the hazards connected to handling chemicals in general."
4,"Very interesting, but is it worth the money?","Given I never knew much about Tesla, I would say this was a worthwhile buy. Outside of that, much of what I learned a friend told me casually in a conversation. There's a nice bunch of other information I, and he, never knew, so that was cool. So I leave it to you to make up your own mind. Are there better dvds out there? I don't know, but I wouldn't have minded the price being a little lower - even though I am a bit stingy! Overall, I'd say it was really cool though, check it out if you get the chance."
3,you get what you pay for,"you get what you pay for with this, and since it is cheap its construction is as well. worked fine, but eventually broke after a few months. the gear mechanism for tightening to the cup holder is pretty cool."
5,sexy XD,"this shirt is SEXY!!!! I'm a chick. and got this for myself. it's well made, and the paint is like well done. holds up in my wash (i wash all my clothes by hand so >_>) anyway the shirt is amazing.a recommend for all WOLVERINE FANS O____O"
5,Gift For my Boyfriend,Got this for my boyfriend and I was a little nervous he is a huge wolverine fan and this isn't the stereotypical wolverine shirt. He ended up loving it. He is very pleased that it is unique and the art portrays him as dark and vicious.
3,Shocking & Beautiful,"This beautifully produced hard cover volume of Winnipeg artist Diana Thorneycroft's self portraits is not for the faint at heart. By playing with light, mask, found items- (broken dolls, hospital equipment), Diana distorts the human form- (her own), and challenges the viewer to re-evaluate sexual and familial stereotypes."
2,Aluminum is not stainless steel!,"Watchout everyone, I ordered this product specifically because it was advestised as the 18/10 Stainless Steel classic style. I received my shipment today and the skillets are both cheap aluminum. There appears to be no way to complain about this to Amazon or to speak to Faberware directly from the Amazon website. The pots are all as advertised 18/10 stainless steel with aluminum core for even cooking temperature--the skillets are both cheap aluminum. I will never again trust Amazon for purchasing such items. Shame on both Amazon and Faberware."
1,I received 2 season 2 dvds and no season 3!,"DO NOT BUY!!! I received three dvds: Season 1 and 2 Season 2s. Beware! I saved this as a gift. When we opened the package, the window for returning it had expired. Guess I'm out of luck."
5,Thank you kindly,"That is exactly how I feel about this series. Great one from the 90's, that I missed out of for some reason or another. Glad they did a good job in producing it for home and library usage. Paul Gross is great and terrific in it. The dog, what can I say..Just watch it."
5,A unique cop show.,"In a world where your average cop show has a bad boy who breaks the rules to get the bad guy we have an unusual series. In Due South the main character is the archetypical good guy. He refuses to break the rules and despite this handicap manages to save the day.I understand that all cop shows are works of fiction, but not since Mayberry's Andy Taylor have we seen a law enforcement officer as good natured, caring and honest as Benton Fraiser. Add to that the fact that he is partnered with a tough Chicago cop with a penchant for breaking the rules and drama and hilarity naturally ensue.If you haven't seen this series by all means do. If you have you will want it in your DVD collection."
2,review of due south dvd,"I received this dvd along with a copy of the bill. When I ordered it the price on amazon was $25.41. However, when I received the dvd I was billed $37.49. Someone owes me $12.08. I am not sure I will order from amazon again. I have been looking for a few days for a way to get in touch with someone who could help me, but I didn't see anyway to reach you, no ""contact us"" on your web site. Not very good customer servce."
5,Tremendous Bargain,"I loved ""Due South"" when it first ran on TV and was excited to buy this DVD set. I paid the $30-some price and thought I had a deal. Since it has gone down to $18-something, I bought three more sets for my uninitiated friends. I am having no trouble with the picture quality. I am appreciating again the excellent writing. There is more depth and character development in these storylines than in many shows today. It is definitely worth taking a chance at this price."
5,Love the show,"Love the show ! I was very surprised, though, to find the fourth season was also included, but not listed. Unfortunately, I also bought the fourth season, so was left with a purchase I didn't need. The seller, gratefully, took the duplicate back. I enjoy the series, and watch it frequently. Thanks!"
5,Rick Steve's European Christmas,"I purchased this DVD as a Christmas gift for a friend after seeing the PBS presentation several times during past Christmas seasons. It is an absolutely lovely tour of Christmas celebrations in England, Norway, France, Italy, Germany and Switzerland. Rick Steves begins the DVD with a reading of the Nativity story and includes both religious and secular celebrations and music. Our Christmas would not be complete without an annual viewing of this wonderful program."
4,A Christmas Treasure,"Rick Steves is one of the best travel writers out there and his unique view about European history is a treasure to the reader. This book is very seasonally appropriate but also very culturally significant. It is entertaining and engaging and opens up the reader to some insights about how Christmas is celebrated in other cultures. The differences are striking, but even more so is how similar they all are.This is a great book for your holiday table. Be sure to catch the video if you can. They are both great holiday trips."
5,Excellent,"This lays it all out, simply and interestingly. It's powerful- to reconfigure your objective reality. All you have to do is put it to work. Somehow the process cuts quickly to the core negative thoughts and can eliminate self sabotaging behavior that is the result of imprisoning beliefs. We all have internalized some misbeliefs along the way, this quickly frees one from those bonds. This is one book that should be in every library."
1,Do not buy from this company,"Shipping was way too expensive, and customer service is extremely slow. I did cancel my order, and they did credit my account. But it took 2 voice mails (they do not take calls directly) and 6 e-mails to do so. By that time, the items had shipped, and had to be returned via Fed Ex, which required more e-mails."
3,A fun book for Doc Savage fans or Alan Moore completists.,"Tom Strong is an entertaining light read, but not up to the high artistic standards one would normally expect from puppet-worshipping madman Alan Moore. A far cry from his more political works like Watchmen or V For Vendetta, it's more like League of Extraordinary Gentlemen Lite. It's a bit ""American"" for my tastes though. I'm American myself, and much of what I enjoy about Moore's prose and dialogue is his skillful use of the English language. At his best he is witty and naturally poetic in a way that is distinctly British... so in books like this one (and even his masterpiece Watchmen) I find myself longing for his long, fluid sentences and deconstructed Dickensian banter. It isn't bad at all, though. Obviously, Moore must have wanted to write a Doc Savage book and this is the result. Don't expect too much, and you might find yourself enjoying it."
5,Great Book!,"This book was great, and hit all the right notes - It's not as deep as most Alan Moore books, although it has some very interesting esoteric topics - but works for what it is - a good old-fashioned doc savage type tale, but with some modern twists. Highly recommend!"
1,BEWARE!!! Disc WILL NOT play !!!,"Trouble with this disc starts right from the start with the FBI warning. The sound sputters off and on, then screen goes totally dark. I have no problem with any of my other discs.Somebody at the Warner's Archive selection is asleep at the wheel.Should be given NO STARS."
4,Original vs new,"I believe that parts of the original movie were cut or left out. It is still a classic to former Marines, but it seems to be missing some scenes. Shipping and delivery were excellent. If I'm wrong I would like to know."
1,Do Not Buy this book as a how to book,For all you witches out there this is not a book on how to do spells it is just a dumb love story.
4,SweetBlood,"Sweetblood is a very well written book, especially if you can relate. Very funny at times. The ending was kind of a bummer."
5,Energy booster...,"My chiropractor suggested this product to me because of the stress on my adrenal glands. I started taking two a day, one in the morning and one at night, and felt my energy rise. Be careful about taking it at night though. I finally figured out it was causing my lack of sleep, but I was never tired during the day. I will always make sure that I have a steady supply of this vitamin!"
1,Doesn't last,"I had this heater for less than a year and suddenly it stopped working. Even though it worked great for the time it lasted, I didn't know it was supposed to be disposable!"
2,perhaps mine is a lemon,"Pretty amazing to see all these positive reviews. I got my TRH0715 yesterday ($49 at Sears) and it still reeks of oil a bit after over 12 hrs of use. But the worst part is that even turned all the way up it only raises my room temperature by a couple of degrees. Granted, I have the house pretty cool - right now the thermostat is set to 53F, but even so, my dinky forced air ceramic heater can get this office up to 60F after a couple/few hours.This is my first oil filled radiator type space heater. I'm hoping that they are not all like this because I like the idea of quiet steady heat. I plan to get another brand to compare and if it is much better than this DeLonghi the DeLonghi is going back to the store."
2,Probably got a returned piece...,"Everything was OK except for one thing. The radiator came pre-assembled in the box, an indication that it was probably sold to someone else first and was returned. I have bought this earlier too a couple of times and one has to assemble the wheels etc. oneself. The power cord too was not packed as new. And sure enough,after about 15-20 days we noticed that the the piece was short circuiting somewhere...and one of the power buttons would work unreliably. We got slow in returning the piece and are stuck now. This was the first time Amazon sent us such a piece....so if the same happens with you, be warned."
2,Acrid Odor,"I've used a DeLonghi Model TRH0715L intermittently for three years now, and it still puts out an acrid odor every time I heat it up. I like that it operates silently, and I think it puts out as much heat as can be expected from a device that runs on normal household circuits. But the odor is really objectionable. I would NOT buy another heater like it, and I would NOT recommend it to anyone else."
4,not what i hoped for,"The product type is DeLonghi TRH0715 Oil Filled Radiator Heater ""safeheater""I anm disappointed. The product description states thatthe heater had an enclosed heating unit thus maintaining a low surface temp.This is not so. I bought this heater for this feature as I have a 6 month old. It get's very hot and is dangerous for young children."
4,DeLonghi TRH0715,"Great for areas where radiating heat is needed, heat is warm and lingering with adjustment features. We are currently using 4 of these heaters to heat our downstairs area, approximately 1400 sf. The numbered dial gives excellent heat control. The wattage economizer makes for cost effecient heating. Heater is too hot to touch while heating up or using high temps which can cause a burn however most heaters of this type can burn at high temps. It is very safe and economic to leave on 24 hours a day as it will shut off automatically once the predetermined heat range is reached. It may seem confusing trying to set the desired temp but just read the directions first. Overall this is a great heater especially for the money. We were using natural gas to heat our home and converted to electric using these heaters when gas prices jumped again this year. We are warm and can also afford to eat. Good job for us DeLonghi!"
