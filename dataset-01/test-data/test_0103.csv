2,with open hands,We were told to order our Women's Summer Study books on line. The book we were shown was a larger beautiful book with wonderful pictures on every page. What came was a much smaller version with ony a few pictures. I was very disappointed with what I received. Especially since I placed the order for several girl frieinds.Suzanne
5,Cary's incisiveness fills niche between Mommsen and Gibbon,"I have the 2nd Edition of this 1935 book. Having read and re-read this and Gibbon and Mommsen, it suddenly struck me that Cary offers a more succinct and incisive interpretation of the MEANING of each epoch in Roman history. He also disagrees markedly from others on the value/meaning of 'controversial' emperors (Nero, Domitian, Diocletian) which is very refreshing and well-stated. Frankly, if you want to get a good sense of the meaning of the History of Rome, read Cary first; then Mommsen, then Gibbon. Then, back to Cary. I wish this book were still in print. Don't let it go unread, if you are a Romanophile..."
4,"A bit better than the Grant, but longer","Furthermore ...-Fails to take stock of the moral implications of gladiatorial contests for the Romans.-Contains a crushing weight of detail regarding municipal organisation for the reader to skip.-Contains very little on the end of the Empire and what followed it.-Cary and Scullard are Empire apologists, claiming the Romans stumbled into possession of an empire they never wanted, while still being good enough to say they consistently laid down provocatively -- indeed unacceptably -- harsh pre-conflict terms of peace.-Virtually ignores the beginnings of Christianity entirely (which may or may not be of passing interest even to a secular spiritualist, depending on whether or not you know)."
4,Not Bridget Jones - thank goodness,"Helen Fielding is better know for Bridget Jones than for Rosie Richardson, but Rosie's personality in 'Cause Celeb' is somewhat deeper than Bridget's despite a similar self-depriciating manner. Moments in 'Cause Celeb' are witty and satitical, moments are wise and sexy, but most of all, this book satirises the great 'personalities' of stage and T.V. and shows them for the shallow people they are. It also deals with the deeper subject of famine relief, highlighting the frustrations of welfare workers, and the nightmare administration that clamps the speedy arrival of proper relief for the malnourished.You'll not read 'Cause Celeb' without laughing, but you'll not read it without a deep sense that things could be improved. At both levels, the book succeeds in telling a good story in a stylish way. Not five stars because it didn't grab me where it hurts and keep me riveted. Still plenty good enough for four."
2,Just never quite comes together,"The 2 stars are strictly for the London portion of Rosie's life - which has much of Fielding's talent for humor in romance. But as soon as Rosie's story gets serious, it fails. Granted, as other reviewers pointed out, most of us reading this were attracted by the fact that Helen Fielding is the author. But she had a way to go before she honed the skills that made Bridet Jones so enjoyable to read."
2,Disappointing,"I loved both of the Bridget Jones books, so I decided to read this one also written by Helen Fielding. I had a hard time getting through it because it was very boring with not much action. Probably the last 40 pages were the best because there was an actual, clear plot to them which made them page-turning. I was very disappointed by this book because it did not have the Bridget Jones' humor I expected and it also did not have a good, focused plot and therefore wasted a couple hundred pages."
3,fun and easy read,"The book was fine and fit the mood I was looking for - e.g. in the vein of Bridget Jones. I still like Bridget better and found some of the repetitions across books annoying, such as both Rosie and Bridget working in publishing offices and having relationships with emotional f*&wits. I thought barbs and jabs were funnier in Bridget Jones. Still if you like this type of writing I think you will enjoy Cause Celeb."
3,Incident at Loring Groves,This was a pretty good book. I am not much of a reader but this book had a very good middle. The beginning was kind of boring to me but it started to become good in about the seventh chapter. I am only in High School and my weakess subject is enlish but after this book I feel like I want to read more. The beginning was kind of boring so thats why I rate this book a three stars.
4,So Good!,"I have to agree with the reviewer who called ""Cause Celeb"" an incredible surprise. I was unsure what to expect after having read the Bridget Jones books, but I was very happy to read a funny, engaging, and touching novel with a heroine to root for. If you like Bridget you will like this book. It is wonderful. Bridget fans will not be disappointed!"
4,Does the job well,"This book explains how OpenSSH works and how to use it. The authors accomplish this goal quite well with no room waasted. The writing is concise, direct, and too the point. The step-by-step style allows you to find the answers you need quickly and logically.While $39 is a bit pricy for a 123 page book, it is worth it. The correct answers are here, and I found the format to be a timesaver. Ths coverage of OpenSSH here is more complete than I've read anywhere else. I recommend it to anyone who wants to know more about OpenSSH."
5,true classic- nothing less,"-The only real wack thing about Full Clip is: that when they've collected all the best tracks of Gang Starr, that they have(!), they took some of the thrilling-nice plessure you feel, when you buy other Gang Starr releases.peace:byskov"
3,Several sought after restaurant recipes.,"This book is special to me because it has the recipe for a cake I had tried in a restaurant in New York, Cafe des Artistes, many years ago, the Ilona Torte. Most of the recipes do not have pictures, which is a major turn -off, but if you've been around you will recognize some famous desserts like Le Cirque's Crème Brlée and the Bresse Farmhouse Chocolate Cake. The book has a chapter on Light desserts, and another in less elaborate desserts mostly homestyle."
5,Excellent!,"I already own this on the original Roadrunner CD version. Also, on vinyl when it was called ""Illusions"". It's a awesome album from the Bay Area Thrash band. It's true speed metal. Unlike the garbage they call Thrash speed metal today (i.e Shandows Fall, Lamb Of God, Black Dahlia Murder). Bands don't make metal like this anymore. If you are unfamiliar. You should purchanse!I am a collector. So, that's why I own 3 copies of the same album. hahaha I highly recommend if your looking for good old metal! Great packaging and sound! Well done overall!"
1,DANGEROUS GROUND,I saw the movie more time then I can think of. The only sad part about the soundtrack it does not have the one song I was looking for that is sung in Zulu. It is also does not have other songs on the soundtrack there were used in the movie.
3,Literature,"Interesting collection with an array of must know pieces. Really enjoyed this great selections, it brought me in the know and was a delight to read."
4,dont knock the cd because of one song,"yes, i love the Teddy P. song as well, and no its not on there. do some research before buying a cd people. lots of songs are not on this cd. i think most people are part of an older generation that appreciate real love songs, im...coughs.. 29 and teddy pendergrass, lenny williams etc can sing what true love songs should sound like. all im saying is dont down this cd because one song isnt on there. i wanted this song as well and just downloaded it on I-tunes for 99 cents instead of buying this whole cd. took me 2 seconds to google this cd and check for teddy p."
1,Shortchanged,The one song I wanted to hear was in the movie. It was a song by Teddy Pendergrass and it was cut out for some reason. The rest of the music was somehow connected to a rap group who did not perform many songs in the movie.It was a waste of cash.
5,Mystikal and Outkast are tha tightest,I think that this album is the shiznit because of tha first track with Mystikal and outkast. Completely off tha hook. Buy this at your nearest sam goody music store and remember-Goody got it.
4,picnic table,"My boys got this table for Christmas so we've used it indoors for the last few months and I absolutely love it. However, I am having the WORST time trying to find the umbrella that goes with it. It has a hole for an umbrella, but I can't find one in stores or on-line anywhere."
4,Another good reference to have on your Kindle,"I have a number of Kindle texts I bought to help me stay working on learning Spanish. This is one of them. I consider it mainly a strong reference text, good to have on my SD card. Fundamental Spanish is the one I reach for the most, though. I'm still at a very beginning level, so it may well be this book will become more important to me as I advance.I thank the volunteers who converted this book very, very much!"
5,Fulton Dual-wheel Trailer jack,"What a big improvement over the single-wheel trailer tongue jack from Fulton! I think every boat owner should have one. It makes moving my boat and trailer around much easier........my wife can even do it now! I'd recommend as a future improvement, wheels that are softer or are inflatable. If you have to go over soft ground, the wheels still dig in a bit.....but much better than the single wheel-version."
5,Finnians Rainbow,"The original cast of Finian's Rainbow is without a doubt in my Opinion oneof the best Broadway Musicals I have ever seen or heard.. There can never be another great like Ella Logan.I have seen them all Ethel Merman, Mary Martin, Carol Channing and Ella is right up there .The musicis unbeleivabe. EVERY SONG A HIT."
3,Emergency War Time Surgery,"As a former Navy Corpsmen during the Vietnam war, Corpsman took part in all battlefield surgery,s. On board ship there is many records of Corpsman preforming emergency surgery,s. I was looking for a more up to date version of a skill I observed in the early seventies , both in the Hospitals and in the Field.The book I recieved was a bad mistake from the ""printer"".Only half of the area of each page is used. The print is so small , words are barely legible and illustrations are nearly useless. It is as if you shunk a page by 50 % and centered it on a larger piece of paper. This is a obvious defect from the printer.All but -useless !"
3,"Weakest of KRS-ONE's efforts, saved by ""A Friend""","I would never diss a KRS record, but this one was just a typical superstar-experimentation CD that we've all heard our favorite artists do. Track 17, ""Just to Prove a Point"" is EMBARRASSING! That's not KRS-ONE, and that's not hip-hop. However, Track 7, ""A Friend"", features the illest production on the album. I don't know what the spotlight reviewer said about it being weakly produced. It's probably one of the best tracks I've ever heard dropped by the Blastmaster. If you want this album, purchase it for that track and enjoy the rest."
2,This album wasn't that good,"I didn't like this album that much. Only songs i liked are The MC, Step Into A World, A Friend, Can't Stop Won't Stop. Just To Prove A Point song was horrible and i don't know why he tried to do a rock song. Putting Puff Daddy on the Step Into A World remix was a terrible decision by KRS. The songs were too short on this album also."
4,authentic feel,"It has been a long time since is the Vol I album and the inclusion of ""friends"" adds a bit more depth to this work. For those who enjoy civil war music with an authentic feel and all its variations, this should be added to your collection."
3,Works fine - seems many do not know how to use it,"I just got this and it works fine - creates nice, thin slices of garlic easily. Some of the other reviewers talked about the garlic bouncing around in the tumbler - they are using it wrong. You have to put it outside the tumble behind the plastic flap and hold that trigger down with one hand as you crank with the other. I tried it with almonds and it worked okay, but much better with the garlic. It should probably come with instructions, as I put it inside the tumbler at first, too. Once you figure it out it serves its purpose."
3,Just Okay,"I've waited a long time to finally see this movie, and I was a little disappointed, the relationship between Martin a Lewis seemed strained. No ""set"" pieces that usually have me falling off my chair. Having said that, I'm a huge fan and I enjoyed it."
5,Outstanding,"This album is magnificent-one of the best compilation albums out there. Instead of just focusing on the main themes, Gerhardt gives us suites of highlights from the movies, some as long as eight minutes. The performance and sound quality are first rate, which is the norm for any of the Gerhardt albums with the NPO. This album makes a perfect compliment to ""The Sea Hawk: Film Scores of Erich Wolfgang Korngold"" and ""Now Voyager: Film Scores of Max Steiner"". Some movies are repeated from those albums to this one (like Robin Hood and the Sea Hawk), but the music selections are different. You'll be sorry if you pass this up."
4,My oh My,I bought this cd 4 my mother but me and her just take it from each other now.It is a great cd and when it came out in the summer of 99' it made Chicago summer even better.It is worth it.
1,BIG MISTAKE,"The product title would make one think they are getting a dozen of these for a really good price. Even the Amazon customer service thought so....nope, you only get ONE. This is rediculous! Don't even bother to order this."
3,A good read but the marriage didn't last!,"I enjoyed this book but am disappointed that the marriage didn't last. Apparently the author is touring India with her third husband, some guy named Phil. I wonder how long the marriage with Denzil lasted and what went wrong? That would make an interesting book!"
5,Exactly as advertised,"This vent arrived in perfect shape just like the description, suited my needs fine. The action on the louver slider is stiff but appropriate. Includes two mounting screws that you can use if you want."
3,Not Bad,"Not a bad book, but not great either. Being from 1999, the information is very dated at this point. Hip surgery (especially labral tears & arthroscopic procedures) is still fairly new & in turn, the information is still growing at a rapid rate. The best information on these type of hip injuries is much more recent.That being said, this is still a decent resource for patients with hip problems. The concepts are great, the information is pretty accurate & there are definitely some good ideas/exercises to implement into your routine if you have a hip injury. However, you would probably be better off reading the more recent medical journals published on the subject & if you can afford it, seeing a Physical Therapist to guide you thru your non-surgical approach to healing your hips.This review is coming from someone who has done countless research on the subject, seen dozens of doctors, PT, etc., had one hip surgery & is preparing for another: I wish you all luck in healing!3.5/5"
4,Good information,"This book has a lot of good information about hips. The excercises are helpful and are explained well.The surgical information is good, though outdated. There are procedures and devices that are not listed so the reader should get additional information from other sources to supplement the information in the book."
5,Both a personal memoir and a lively insider's account of the Olympic sports world,"Any interested in the sport of fencing will find engrossing RUNNING WITH SWORDS: THE ADVENTURES AND MISADVENTURES OF THE IRREPRESSIBLE CANADIAN FENCING CHAMPION. Author Sherraine Mackay's Olympic dreams and efforts to chase them across Europe made her among the top ten women fencers in the world. From her personal upset in Greece to her success in leading her team to fourth place in the Olympics, RUNNING WITH SWORDS is both a personal memoir and a lively insider's account of the Olympic sports world.Diane C. DonovanCalifornia Bookwatch"
4,A well-printed collection of good pictures.,"This is a collection of portraits of Malanga's friends and acquaintances made in the 1970s. Some of the subjects are very famous, some are not.Malanga has a simple, straightforward style free of gimmicks, and the quality of the reproductions is excellent. If you enjoy books of portraits, this will be the perfect addition to your collection."
3,A little disappointed,"It's being hailed as one of Milos Forman's greatest films. He moved to America from Czechoslovakia after his film was banned ""forever"" in that country. I did find it somewhat amusing.When a fireman's ball dissolved into anarchy, the movie then became truly interesting. One actor had a gift for showing a lot of emotions with his face and I enjoyed watching him. I suppose that the film says a lot about small town life in that country at the time it was made, and it certainly wasn't flattering. But the government must have been way too sensitive to make a fuss over a little bit of self-deprecating humor. I think the average Czech citizen would recognized a little of themselves and chuckled."
1,First Dolemite Now This,"Who's taking the loss on this ""album?"" Is this a ""file under comedy"" CD? Personally, I'd stick to Eddie Murphy, Richard Pryor, and Chris Rock. Sorry, Shaq-P.U., the refs can't help you with this brick. What's that smell?"
1,The Best?,"Actually, this 'Best of Shaquille Oneal' album is one hour of silence. He did not have any hits. Ever."
3,Rust Spots Inside,"If this kettle rust inside after a while, then it is made of poor quality stainless steel. It should be at least 18/10 and best 18/18 but it is no where on the kettle."
5,best teakettle,"My previous teakettle was also a KitchenAid. Through no fault of its own, I accidentally turned it on with no water in it and then when my better half discovered it on the stove he threw it immediately in cold water which cracked the enamel. I didn't hesitate to buy another because I love the design. I think I actually like this color/finish better than our old black one."
3,Handle does get very HOT!!!,"We have had this tea kettle for two weeks and we are returning it to Meyer Corp (Kitchen Aide), because the handle does get very Hot and dangerous for my elderly Mother to use!"
2,Not great.....,"I have had this kettle for less than 2 months. I have the brushed stainless steel model, and I like the way it looks and pours. The kettle is substantial in weight, and the whistle is fine for me, no complaints there. However, this morning my husband pointed out, as he was going to refill the kettle, that around the rim of both the lid and the opening there are ""rust"" marks, and it would probably be a good idea to clean it. I took a soft scrub type sponge, and needless to say, the marks are not coming off. I really find this unacceptable. I have had many other stainless steel kettles that have never shown ""rust"". Not a happy camper. The thing was not cheap, either. Very disappointed. I would definitely not buy this one again."
5,Great Kettle~,"This is exactly what I was looking for- durable, nice size and easy to use. It matches my new cookware set that I got from amazon too;) The price was unbeatable and I shopped around quite a bit. It's also not the shiny steel so it doesn't look as dirty/smudgy as others I've owned."
2,"Nice looking Tea Kettle, but ...","This is a nice Tea Kettle. However, if you leave the spout either open of close, it leaks water on the stove. My previous teak kettle did not do this. So I assume it is a faulty design. Wiping the stove multiple times daily can get old. I have returned this product."
3,Beautiful but not user friendly,"This kettle is beautiful to look at. I leave it on my stove as it looks very nice with my stainless steel appliances. However, on the practical side, it has some drawbacks. First of all, don't touch the handle ever without a potholder. You will burn yourself. The handle gets very hot. Also you need to open the spout with your hand and this too gets hot. The probability of burning yourself on this kettle is high. But once you get the hang of it, it's a lovely tea kettle. Just a bit more beautiful than functional."
3,"Decent kettle for the price, but not great.","This kettle is nice because it is stainless instead of enamel. It is of basic/simple design and appears very durable. It is easy to clean as well. The whistle assembly is poorly designed. The kettle has a weak whistle, and drips condensation from the spout well before whisle is audible. Rubber insert in handle is a little small, and metal part of handle does get hot."
2,definitely not a stellar kettle experience,"for starters, the product arrived with a very marred finish. don't know if all the stainless steel kettles have this, but was a bit disappointed. however, as it would have cost more to ship it back, i decided to keep it and deal and hope for the best.in short: the kettle opening doesn't lend itself to easy cleaning. the handle gets rather hot to the touch when the water boils. the spout opener is a rather ill-thought-out concept -- pushing it down so close to boiling water/steam is not exactly a well-thought-out design feature.in short, you'd probably be better served by a pan of water that has a pouring lip on the side. it's that disappointing."
1,"Kitchenaid Gourmet Essentials 2 Quart Tea Kettle, Brushed Stainless Steel",Do not buy this kettle. Very bad quality and thin steel. I already have a dent in it!
4,Want to be a Restaurant owner?,"Want to be a Restaurant owner? Watch this detail DVD on one the most well known restaurateurs in New York city. Great behind the scenes of building, layout and food ideas long before they open the door. Also they share the ending of their dreams were most people would not."
4,Nice looking box.,"This is a great little box for storing men's jewlery. I just dinged it one star because the ring slots are shallow and several of the rings I own are large (thumb type, etc.) and do not fit in the space provided. This would be a five star case if not for that little niggle."
4,Not waterproof. But great vibe.,"I bought this vibe thinking I would be able to use it in the shower, so I tried it, but it half stopped working. I can still use it, but I don't use it in water any more. It is great for it's speed. Ok for it's quietness. You will love it if u just dont put it in water."
3,I wonder,Everything in the package was opened when it was delivered to its destination. I doon't know if a used product was shipped or if customs was resposible for this.
4,LOU'S MOST ATYPICAL ALBUM,"This is probably Reed's most atypical solo album and at first sounds lightweight and subdued, laking the great moments, drama and exciting highlights of his best work. Hard to appreciate immediately, repeated listens reveal Coney Island Baby's lyrical depth and melodic beauty. My favorites include the love song She's My Best Friend, the streetwise Charley's Girl and the sensitive narrative of the title track. Not his greatest album, but valuable as a showcase of Reed's human side in its warmth and simplicity."
4,It's excellent game!!!,This game was excellent and fun. This game was using the card and then play. That was cool. This game never get bored. It's family game. I enjoy the game.
3,"OK, but not great","We are big fans of the show, and were excited to try this game. First of, the game moves very slow - it takes a while to switch between scenes, and react to your selections. The screen just freezes all the time. We played 3 times, and got the same questions several times - so the question bank must not be too big. Overall, they could have done better things with the game."
2,Should have been better..,"The people who made the game should have spent more time making sure the game was good before releasing it. Its too slow, the questions repeat too often, and being asked if i want to walk away at each Question while i have all lifelines gets old. It could have been designed much better and with more questions.Also the questions dont go in any particular order, one question was asked as the $500,000 then a few games later the same question was asked as a $4000 question. The Million dollar question was easier then some of the thousand dollar questions.Overall it was enjoyable for $[...], but im disappointed at what could have been offered."
4,Millionaire Game,"We have played only one game so far, but one major drawback is that only one person can use a lifeline at a time. The game then gives the answer, even though another person would like to use a lifeline too. So that second person gets to go on in the game, even though they did not know the answer."
2,Totally ridiculous,"Okay, I have to admit that Fist of the North Star was enternaining to watch, assuming you watch it with friends who can mock the movie with you. But it was really, really bad. First of all the movie was entirely too long, the plot was kind of untineresting and I lost track of who most of the characters were for a while. That didn't really matter though. After a point the movie breaks down... ... All it all this movie is terrible the plot is horrible, the violence is ridculous, and the ending will leave you ranting and screaming ""What the heck was that!"" for hours."
1,There is good animation. This isn't.,"I saw this in a small college movie theatre 8+ years ago. I don't remember much detail except for the fact that this movie brought home the fact that all anime is not good. In fact, anything except for scooby doo is better than this. Stay away."
5,The One,I searched for years to get this version. Awesome. o oh staring in the heart of madenss o oh
4,Good solid animation...and lots of exploding heads...,"Ever seen a head explode after one punch? Well you will see that in this movie....about a 100 times. This movie has been compared to Dragonball Z, just more intense...It is somewhat...men with superhuman strength and all striving to reign over all is pretty much the gist of it...the color red is a very popular color in this movie because you sure as hell see a lot of it...don't get me wrong, the story and animation are solid....the ending was sorta of a let down for me...but it left room for additions..."
4,A dummy comments,"This book apparently is the most recent edition of the original book. Having no background whatsoever in biology, I purchased this to get an introduction and learn some basic concepts, and have not yet finished reading the book. It is amazing how complex the field of biology necessarily is, and it is slow but interesting reading for a ""dummy"" like me. While this book (like the whole ""Dummies"" series) is well written, I do think the author could have used clearer language in some places to explain one point or another -- maybe should have had people outside the field proofread the text for clarity. Overall, however, it has been a good purchase."
4,useful backup,"For serious statistics research, why recode many functions from scratch? There are several proprietary alternatives, like SAS and S -Plus. But those are not the cheapest of items. Increasingly, others are turning towards an open source package, R. This book is the authoritative manual for R's base.The utility of the documentation is not just in explaining the computational subroutines. Arguably, it can be as important to know the GUI. These days, given the size of data sets, being able to visualise and navigate through these can be of primary importance.The publisher says that $10 from each purchase will go to the R foundation, for their continued operation. Certainly, if you like R, that is a good thing. But you might want to consider donating more to the foundation, and just use the R online documentation."
2,converter,"It seemed like a good idea but when I got it out of the box, I saw that it needed for me to drill holes in my stroller. I didn't want to have to drill holes into my stroller. No instructions, so that's what I guessed needed. So, in the end, I figured out a way to convert my jogging stroller into carrying my baby's car seat with no cost out of my pocket."
5,A must read for Tar Heel fans everywhere,"I loved this book. I've been a Tar Heel fan for over 30 years now (1981 semifinal game vs UVA and Ralph Sampson), and now I have a better understanding of the players that have helped define the program that has been above all others in college athletics. Thank you Art Chansky"
2,"Imaginative, but not engaging.","I'll give Aldiss credit for creativity -- this story of far future Earth is full of very imaginative landscapes, flora, and fauna. But there's not much else to recommend it. The speculations on the evolutionary history of Earth are a little too implausible to overlook. And the story line seems little more than a mechanism for introducing more outlandish creatures.I expect it would be more enjoyable for younger readers, or those who don't demand that the science in their fiction be at least plausible.As a last note, I should mention that I came across this book as one of Easton Press' ""Masterpieces of Science Fiction"" series. Given that it is apparently a classic, my viewpoint is perhaps in the minority."
2,How did this win the Hugo?,"How did this win a Hugo? Was there no other competition? The prose in this book was rambling and the direction of the story was....Well, there was no direction to the story. It introduced some weird possible animals but for all intents and purposes, this book was a flop!"
2,Disappointed,Yeah it doesn't say but when you buy the 'whole cd' you actually only get like 4 of the tracts and not the whole thing
3,CRC Textbook: we need better resources,"This book was required for an introductory graduate course to clinical research that I am taking. This text is too general and a lot of what is said seems to be common sense. There need to be more concrete examples: e.g. example case report forms, what a protocol schema looks like, and more on what an industrial environment looks like vs. an academic medical center one. From reading this text I feel that I understand the roles of the coordinator in a very broad sense, but have not grasped enough specific information to ""hit the ground running"". One redeeming factor is that the GCP guidelines are included as an appendix."
1,Talentless score and a vastly mediocre Porter musical,There is nothing memorable in this score to the musicalized version of the Garbo film NINOTCHKA. Astonishing that Cole Porter wrote it. The show and the resultant film were hits but terribly mediocre. Why this score is on CD is a puzzlement when more worthy ones are not.
5,This will be a great movie; maybe Sean Connery as Momsen,I heard Peter Maas on the Imus morning show and was so intrigued by the story that I ordered the book the same morning. I have not been disappointed. This is a true story of a great American hero.
4,"An excellent, fun, fast read","The Terrible Hours is a great read. It keeps you interested and glued to its pages. I too look forward to seeing Sean Connery as Momsen in the movie. If you liked ""The Hunt for Red October"" you will be entranced by this adventure."
1,save your money,"I bought this thinking it would be cute to have and for when i dont have my digi with me and it was a waste of money,so hard to use and i got one decent picture out of all the ones i took most came out blurred even though i was still or with this trippy color effect where everything was rainbow colored,save your money and buy something else."
5,Beautiful illustrations - excellent introduction to art,"My two year old son and I enjoy reading this book together every night. He loves to look at the art and find different items. Two eyes, four fish, twelve squirrels and nineteen angels! It is a wonderful introduction to fine art and especially good for parents to read too! Such a nice change from traditional toddler level books."
5,Couldn't put it down,"Although it took me a while to figure out who was who with the large amount of character, I did find them believable and necessary to the story line. There was plenty of action that kept me anxious to turn the pages. As a christian I can relate to both the charcters who believed and didn't believe but wanted to."
4,"Great book, but VERY violent","I am not exactly an avid reader, but I read this book in three days. The Ezekiel Option is like seeing next year's news headlines today. The plot is very good, and gives the reader insight into the psychology and ambitions of the current governments of the world. It is truly amazing how many events Mr. Rosenberg introduces in this novel as ""fiction"" which have since transpired. Surely, the coming of the Lord must be soon. This should open readers' eyes to the greatness of the Bible, as God has been so gracious to tell us what is about to happen and how to prepare. I would have given five stars, but as a christian, I am a little put off by all of the violence. I believe that Mr. Rosenberg is very talented and could have written an equally exciting book without so many blood stains."
5,Book Review - The Ezekiel Option,Outstanding book by Joel Rosenberg. It is #3 in his political thriller series about events unfolding in the end times.
5,Excellent adventure story based on Prophecy,"I heard Joel Rosenberg talking on the radio about this book and decided to buy it. Very happy I did. Strong story based on biblical prophecy and very relevant in the current tumultuous political landscape that we presently live in. Rosenebergs' past novels have all been released before what he writes about happens in the real world (i.e. 9/11 and Iraq war). Hopefully, for our sake, he is not on target with this one. Good character development, strong plot and interesting subject matter make this book very difficult to put down."
4,spiritual fiction,"Excellent book. It is one of a four book series. Unfortunately, the publisher did not number them, so when I started reading the series I read them out of order. I definitely would recommend all of Joel Rosenberg's books.It discusses the end times and the upcoming war in the middleast, that will bring about World War 3. It may be fiction, but it is very close to reality and what could happen in the near future. I definitely would recommend all of Joel Rosenberg's books."
5,This Could Happen,"I don't usually read fiction, but after the first chapter I could not put it down and gave it to friends and family. This guy knows bible prophecy."
5,A MOST EXCELLENT READ!!!!!!,"I RECEIVED THIS BOOK AS A CHRISTMAS GIFT. I HAD NEVER HEARD OF ROSENBERG BUT NOW I HAVE ORDERED TWO MORE OF HIS BOOKS. IF THEY ARE ANYTHING LIKE THE EZEKIEL OPTION, I'M HOOKED!I THANK HIM FOR SHARING HIS TALENT AND THE LIFE ALTERING EXPERIENCE OF ACCEPTING JESUS CHRIST AS LORD AND SAVIOR!"
1,The Ezekiel Option,"I was looking forward to being able to listen to this cd while I traveled recently. However, it is an mp3/cd and my cd player would not play it. New and improved technology is great, but I am really having a difficult time staying up with it all. Therefore I really can't review the book. I don't seem to have any device with which to listen.The Ezekiel Option (Political Thrillers Option #3)"
5,Joel Rosenberg's Triumphant Return,"This book is the best of the Rosenberg trio of thrillers. If Mr Rosenberg feels that the prophecies of Ezekial 38 & 39 are imminent, then we should all try to get right with God, since it is widely believe in Christian circles that this is the prophecy that precedes the immediate 2nd coming of Christ.The ability of the author to chronicle the GW Bush presidency during his three books has been uncanny, and this book does not disappoint. All of his political training has paid off and we the reader are the beneficiary. Truly, Mr. Rosenberg was born to write this material - to warn us all of what's to come."
3,Great grasp of geography and prophecy,I actually got a geography and history lesson out of this book.Statements Mr. Rosenberg made about geographical locations and history related to Iran I followed up with research and discovered he had a pretty good lock on the subject which made the book all the more fun.In fact he inspired me to write a couple of Daily Thoughts for my subscribers out of research his book provoked.Dr. Michael L. FordJonsquill Ministries
1,great seller,"Much to technical. overly wordy. i know it's reccomend by people with much better educations than myself, but don't waste your time."
2,8 flims to die for!,i HAVE PURCHASED ALL OF THESE MOVIES. THISIS ONE THAT I LIKED THE LEAST. THE WHOLE MOVIE IS SUUBTTLED. NOT GOOD AT ALL WHEN TRYING TO WATCH A HORROR MOVIE! THE PLOT NEEDED WORK.IF YOU WANT THE WHOLE COLLECTION GET IT OTHER WISE LEAVE IT.
5,Makes the Bizkit look REAL Limp,"I gotta say, I was more than a little curious when I saw this album on the shelves at the record store. What the hell kind of name is hed (p.e.)? I had to check it out, and I'm sure glad I did. These guys just take the whole rapcore thing to a whole new level. Rarely will you find a band that combines so many different styles together so well. Some songs are just true crushing hardcore songs, some songs are more hip-hop flavored, some songs are just straight up funk, some songs are all of these in one, and throughout the whole album it just sounds like hed (p.e.) and no one else. I really hope these guys gain the recognition they deserve real soon, because a band this good can't stay underground forever. If you like Snot, Incubus, Ultraspank, or even Limp Bizkit, check this out right now, you won't be dissapointed."
5,And you though LIMP BIZKIT was good,IF you dig Limp Bizkit but wish that they were a little heavier and funkier then hear you go. This is one of the best albums to come out last year and still be climbing. This is an album that you have to have in you collection for ever.
5,Excellent!!!,"This CD is the snish!!..Probably one the best R&B albums I own to date. A album full of nice and sensual R&B, what more can you ask for?....This is the way R&B is supposed to be...The Slow jams on this CD are great!!...next time when I have my girl over, I will be bumpin this.....=D......"
5,Excellent lyrics and tight vocals,"We can definitely see Joe's growth on this new LP and I compliment him. The brother definitely has talent. I am now anticipating another album from him. This particular LP was full of ballads but there were a couple up tempo joints, put together to create the masterpiece ""All That I Am"". This LP was great because it addressed some of the very issues that plague relationships in the 90's. Joe was able to put these feelings into words and he did so very well. I recommend this album to those who aren't familiar with his work and to those who are long time fans."
4,Museum with Benefits,"Michael and Rebecca have the usual prickly romance, with some help from some supernatural friends. It's an entertaining, quick read with some nice historical details thrown in for information and enlightenment."
5,Good read for the Gothic bone...,"I picked this up looking for a Gothic mystery. It didn't disappoint. It has all the right stuff, a castle, some pretty wild weather, ghosts and just enough romance to add to the intrigue but not bog down the rest of the tale. It had enough meat to the book to last awhile, not one of those that are so short they aren't even worth getting started on. Great book to curl up by the fire with and get lost for awhile. I'll be looking for other stuff she's written."
5,Puttin' It Down For The Yay Area!,"B-Legit holds it down for the Yay Area but not with ""The Click"" but solo wise. He makes sure you feel this album with knockin' beats and lyrics showing you that he's not in 40 waters shadow. Not only does he put it down by himself but he features some of the top rappers puttin' it down for California. I recommend this album to everyone who likes E-40, Suga T, D-Shot, and ""The Click"" because B-Legit shows he's a major part of ""The Click"""
5,OFF THE HEEZY!!!!,"One of the best albums I've ever heard. B-Legit's great delivery and lyrics along with many fly guest featured over this tight production - it just makes a perfect album with the bay area flava. C-Bo, Kurupt, E40, Celly Cell and many more join the Savage in one of the west coast best and most underrated albums. Get that fly sh*t!!!"
2,A slow second act.,"I could read Perry's descriptions of a English countryside for hundreds of pages, but I can not say the same about the way she goes on about the emotions the characters are experiencing in this book. When Perry did give descriptions of the horrors of the first World War the book picked up very well, and even the side excursion to Gallipoli was done well. The story does get sidetracked from original murder mystery, but not to a point of no return. The ongoing chase of 'The Peacemaker' still entertains, but his machinations do not seem overly inspired in this book. If the third novel goes the same directions, in terms of exploring the emotional side of the characters, vice historical fiction and mystery I will give up on the series. Instead, I will pick up on the new Arturo Perez-Reverte series sooner then I expected."
2,Different things for different people,"This book is not for me (I got to page 70). A friend recommended it and since we have similar tastes I figured I should check it out. One instance where I should have listened to my intuition and just passed on it. I could go on about all the things I don't like about this book but really the most helpful thing I can say is listen to your intuition on this one, if it's not a hell yes then it's a hell no. It might speak to you but it certainly doesn't speak to me."
5,a must for the bocephus fan,"an interesting array of performers. everbody did their own twist on hank jr classics. there are some disappointing cuts, marshall tucker could have done better as well as aaron tippon. however lynyrd skynyrd pulls through to give a great version of born to boogie, montgomery gentry has some fun with women i've never had. trace goes out on a limb with the obscure eleven roses, done very tastefully. i was surprised not to see travis tritt, charlie daniels, willie nelson, toby keith, kidd rock or even hank III. i wish there was twenty more songs."
4,Great,I think that this CD was very good but the only thing that I disliked was that Trick Pony song All my rowdy friends are coming over tonight. I dislike it because the main singer is a girl and she makes the song sound ...( but that is probably my fav. song by Hank) but other than that its good but its not Hank!
5,Great Soft Rock CD,"This CD is great. It has a lot of soft rock songs that are good and even some early R&B such as the Comodors. I really like Eva Cassidy's version of ""Fields of Gold."" I think this one is worth buying for any fan of soft rock or 70's music. Not all of the songs are from that decade, but a lot are."
5,The Firm,Enjoyed the movie The Firm. Tom Cruise is amazing as he is in most movies that are action packed. Very believable acting. An excellent cast.
5,THE FIRM,"Sydney Pollack directs Tom Cruise in this fast paced legal thriller based on John Grisham's best selling - selling novel. Lured by extraordinary financial perks, Mitch McDeere, a young and hungry Harvard Law student, turns down offers at the top law firms to take a position at a small but wealthy Memphis firm. Mitch, a boy from the wrong side of the tracks fueled by ambition and greed, ignores his wife Abby's initial misgivings about the suspiciously paternalistic practices of his new employers. It's only when two of his fellow lawyers die in a mysterious accident that Mitch begins to share her apprehensions. He then launches an investigation into the true nature of the firm and discovers that it is a front for a complex and sinister web of organized crime, one from which no lawyer has managed to escape alive. Solid storytelling and fine preformances bring this seemingly improbable situation straight into reality."
1,Read the book,This is one of Tom's worst movies. The book was so much better. The movie did not even follow the novel and I was bored through out the movie. John Grisham's novel is better when read.
3,Professioanl handling improves upon a hohum book,"This was the biggest movie going when it came out; now, no one remembers it as anything other than the first John Grisham movie. Setting the standard for the modern legal thriller, the firm impresses us with the way that Tom Cruise exerts superhuman effort in order to excel enough to graduate top of his class. But the firm which hires him with an offer that's too good to refuse eventually turns out to have some ulterior motives, and Cruise finds himself having to apply his superior morals to the situation, which finds him in conflict with some not-very-nice people, headed by Wilford Brimley. This works as a thriller, and I actually thought that the actors and filmmakers brought more humanity to the characters than the book."
2,It was ok,"I personally didnt like the movie that much. Think I would of liked it better if I had not read the book, but I did. So I pretty much hated the movie, but loved the book. It was an awesome book, with a lot of suspence, and a good ending. Then I see the movie, and its totally changed! The entire second half of the book isnt even in the movie. Not a good ending at all. If you really want to know more about the firm, read the book, dont go and rent the movie. It seems like they tried to get more into the relationships of the people in the movie, where its more suspencefull in the book, dealing more with the mob and the F.B.I. I was going to go buy the movie because I loved the book some much. Good thing I didnt."
2,Not one of Grisham's best.,"I rented this movie last Sunday upon a recommendation by some friends, and was very sincerely dissapointed. I rented it along with The Juror and watched The Juror first, thinking that if I did not like it I would always have the better movie to fall back upon. Ha! I was MIGHTILY irritated by the music, which seemed like it would have fit better on an episode of Sesame Street, and I was dissapointed in the lack of suspensful events. I am a fan of John Grisham's works, and although I will admit I have not read this novel, I thought this was by far his worst attempt. If you want to see a truly good Grisham movie, rent or buy A Time To Kill."
3,"Good, but drops at the end","Reasonably good version of the John Grisham bestseller: Sharp, idealistic Mitch McDeere leaves Boston for Memphis and the firm of Bendini, Lambert and Locke, making a Faustian bargain in the process. Once he gradually discovers their evil doings, both the FBI and the Firm get very interested. Has a good sharp story and solid ensemble cast, but the ending, which differs from the novel, has some major plot holes. Still, a pretty good thriller."
3,read the book,"The book was just so much better that it was hard to get into the movie. I don't think Tom Cruise was best suited for the role. He lacked a maturity even for a young lawyer and his performance was uneven. But the movie looks good and it is entertaining, but if you've read the book you'll find yourself drawing unfavorable comparisons."
2,Short but Not Sweet,"I recently purchased the book ""The Random House Book of Fairy Tales"", thinking that it would be a good representation of some of the most famous fairy tales in history. While the selection of tales was very impressive (and the reason why I felt comfortable buying this book) I was very dissappointed by how the stories were edited. I felt that the endings came abruptly and that parts of the body of the stories were trunkated and at times disconnected.I would recommend searching further if you want to find a more throrough representation of these selections."
5,The Random House of Fairy Tales,"The Random House Book of Fairy Tales (Random House Book of ...)I'm not sure if my other review worked so just in case I'm doing it again.I was so impressed at the quality of trouble taken in the packaging and postage of my purchase. Because the book was bought at a fabulously low price, I guess I didn't expect that kind of care to be taken. I was so wrong. This experience has encouraged me to buy more books from you. I have grandchildren and grandnieces and -nephews that I want to give the gift of reading to and you'll be very instrumental in doing that. Again thank you."
3,Transatlantic humor,"I won't say that _Three Men in a Boat_ isn't funny. It is. But the humor isn't singular and quintessentially English, as it's often described. In fact, it's a lot like Mark Twain's, just not as funny.If you enjoy the combination of whimsy and satire mixed with travel, you'd do even better to read _Roughing It_, _The Innocents Abroad_, or _A Tramp Abroad_."
4,It's very humorous,"There are some parts that are slow, but overall, it has made me chuckle. I find it interesting that the things that made for frustrated-so-it's-funny stories back then are pretty applicable to the 21st century."
1,I'm not buying it,I've heard 15 of these songs because I got sucked into buying the 4 disc Tracks for $60 Canadian. Adding three songs to this disc not included on the the 4 disc Tracks is the biggest rip-off of the decade...if you allow yourself to be taken. I'm not going to buy it.
1,Disappointing collection,"I gave such a low rating because Springsteen really rips off his fans. Everybody who saved money to afford the 4-CD-box (which I highly recommend) now has to pay an additional expense for 3 more songs. Plus, the given selection may not match everyone's personal choice."
3,Still Sounds Like The Boss To Me,I couldn't afford the $65.00 box set so I was delighted this compilation came out from the box set. It's nothing special but it's still Bruce and still sounds as good as he always sounded. Those of you that are disappointed in the box set go to a used cd store and sell it and stop whining!
1,BORN TO CA$H IN!,"Instead of calling his greatest song ""Born to Run"" a more appropriate title would have been ""Born to take every dime that my fans have slaved for."" Does Bruce have any idea what the average person goes through to make ends meet? I doubt it. If he came out of his mansion and looked around once in a while he probably wouldn't feel the need to hold us up at every turn for more money. This is unforgiveable!"
2,Scented Mineral Oil,"I don't recommend this product, unless you're buying it because it reminds you of days gone by. Otherwise, it's made of too many unrecognizable ingredients, and the rose scent is dull."
3,Competently written.,"Ten Plus One by Ed McBain is a competently written police procedural, slightly above average in quality when compared to other books within the same genre. Detectives Steve Carella and Meyer Meyer of the 87th precinct are called upon to find a serial sniper who has been terrorizing the city. McBain has populated this book with an exceptionally large number of diverse characters. Some are believable while others are unidimensional stereotypes lacking authenticity. The plotting is workmanlike with an ample number of false leads designed to misdirect the reader before the identity of the killer is revealed in the final chapter. Above average but falls short of the threshold for a 4 star rating."
4,A competent cop thriller with odd bits of humor,"McBain does a competent job of writing crime thrillers, so this is a safe book to buy to kill a few hours with some decent reading.I think he really shines at injecting bits of humor into the story line, moreso than any other writer that I've read in the genre (eg compared to Grisham). (At least I get 3 or 4 really good laughs out of each book, so I think the humor is funny; you might not...)"
1,Two Times Disappointed,"Well after reading the great reviews, I wanted to try this product. I ordered and paid almost $18 for the one day shipping. I received item...no whitening gel was inside box. Frustrating!! I contacted Amazon...they said they would send a replacement...next day. Great!! I received a new kit. No whitening gel. I contact yet again to say 'can you please just send me a COMPLETE kit or the gel?' and they said ""sorry, this is a widespread problem and we are not able to resend another"" but they are going to credit my account and said to just throw the other two shipments out. So if you're going to order this product, make sure you contact them first to see that this problem has been taken care of or you'll wind up with something you can't use!"
5,Yohimbo's connected to your tebow,When Yohimbo's connected to your Tebow its difficult to choose which to look at. They should definitely come out with Samurai football.
4,"A Japanese ""western"" of a different kind","Kurosawa follows a simple story of a lone free-lance samurai (Mifune) who arrives in a town and is informed of the destruction that is caused by the war between two clans of ruthless gamblers. Then he decides to play the game in his own rules and annihilate the thugs through cunning and deception. Along the way, the brave samurai does not avoid a few harrowing moments where he nears death, but his excellent mastery of the sword, his quick thinking and his superior morality triumphs in the end. It is a tradional japanese film which does not have many battle scenes, or fantastically choreographed swordplay but very good acting."
3,I deducted a star for low bit rate,"This is the follow up to the excellent Yojimbo. The Criterion dvd for Yojimbo is outstanding, unfortunately the Criterion version of Sanjuro doesn't live up to expectations. The bit rate is considerably lower than any other dvd I have viewed, and while the video quality is by no means horrible, discerning videophiles will be unhappy. Unsophisticated viewers probably won't notice the difference, but if you are ordering the dvd version of Sanjuro, it is unlikely that you are an unsophisticated viewer ;) Nevertheless, no Kurosawa fan should be without this, seeing as how it is the only dvd version of this movie. Just don't expect the video quality of Criterion's dvd releases of Yojimbo or Seven Samurai."
4,Pretty enjoyable watching.,I have never really understood the hype or reverance that surrounds a Kurosawa film. I have enjoyed alot of his films and his samurai films do seem to be the most well known. Sanjuro is better than some I have seen. The action is good and fast and there is a fair amount of humour in this film. The interesting thing about the 9 samurai is that they hav been written almost as if they are one person. They evolve as a whole and not individualy. It is like they are the collective good of the clan and the ronin is always dealing with one person even though they are nine. It is a good fun movie and good to see on DVD. Would be nice to see them a little cheaper and some extra features would have been nice. But the movie is still very watchable and well worth the effort.
5,Do You Feel Lucky Kurosawa?,"Toshiro Mifune's silk clothes must stink, but don't mess with this guy. He's a killer with a bad hair-do. I loved the hired killers of the village with their brag and weird swordplay stances. There's a 19th Century Japan feel to a village that might as well have been Dodge City in the American West. Kurosawa is a funny guy. How he adapted Dashel Hammet's California gangster story of waring gangs is Asian alchemy."
5,Really practical and useful ...,"You are an entrepreneur in the process of creating your business for the lasting success it deserves. Do so with a strong foundation of the detailed knowledge of the process provided in this book. This book will save you a lot of time and protect you from mis-steps by helping you understand the financial aspects of your startup.The author treats the subject in a ready-to-use, practical terms. The book discusses the most important financial steps the startup must take - financial plannning, understanding and attracting the right kind of investment and the financial execution during the early stage. Along the way, the author discusses the issues that one can only gain by many years of experience. Highly recommend it."
1,Too much fluff,"I should have read the reviews more carefully - the repeated use of the word ""sexy"" was the tip off that this is more romance than mystery. Sadly, I got all the books in the series at the same time! I couldn't even stomach finishing the first one.I really wish that Amazon would clearly mark the romance and other genre novels. It would save a lot of time."
2,Couldn't finish this book,"Seems to me I have a much different opinion of this book than others. I didn't enjoy the main character - with her dresses to ""just below the knee"" (whatever that means - I took it to be a fashion faux pas, but that's just me) and her annoying habits - but more importantly, I didn't find any of the characters real or believable. Glad others enjoyed it, but I just didn't find it to be well-written. Only reason I'm not going with only one star is I understand the life of a writer, and just because I didn't enjoy the book, doesn't mean I want to completely slam the poor author."
4,Great,"Great CD, but NOBODY should have to fish out $70 for it. Its almost impossible to find elsewhere, sadly."
4,"fine, but markedly inferior to the OBC","The film soundtrack to DAMN YANKEES is similar but certainly quite inferior to the peerless 1955 original Broadway cast album. The Warner Bros. film brought the entire original cast to reprise their roles (with the exception of Stephen Douglass who was replaced by Tab Hunter, who provided the marquee-value for the box office). Gwen Verdon's performance of Lola is perhaps even better here than on the 1955 OBC; she belts the role a little better and on the whole her singing is stronger here. Shannon Bolin gets a new song ""There's Something About an Empty Chair"" which isn't really memorable. Rae Allen once again knocks `em dead with ""Shoeless Joe from Hannibal, MO"", and Ray Walston's performance of Mr Applegate is priceless. Tab Hunter is only average in his singing as the younger Joe Hardy. The remastering of this album is quite fine; there is some scratch and surface-hiss, but nothing too-obtrusive.Very nice for the price."
3,Not bad.,A previous reviewer said it was better than 'The Count of Monte Cristo'. Not so. I didn't finish this one.
3,it's still dave shouse,"unfortunately this cd suffers from a lack of originality. not musically but in the choice of songs. there is a grifters song here, a bunch of songs that appeared on the first souls record and a dambuilders song or two. nonetheless there are some very beautiful moments and the lyrics are still shouse's. so who's to complain?"
4,Choice Hot Tuna,This is another fine album by Hot Tuna. The range of the band is clearly shown in the selections here.
2,A not-so-polished turd,"Watch this not-so-good documentary about surfing around the great lakes region for information only.Interesting, but, not entertaining.Informative, but, not insightful.I would like to see a documentary about surfing the great lakes that was made by a documentarian with some actual talent."
3,lame surf scenes,"lame. Step into Liquid has the same guys in the same surf and does a better job in ten minutes than this does full featured. Not to bust on those guys and all. A good bunch of Lads, probably the mellowest and all around cool. If I lived there, I'd probably want to hang."
4,A book of difficult choices,"This story is told as a flashback memoir, but essentially it carries straight on from the first book in this series BROTHERS IN ARMS, although we do have some glimpses of Scott's future after the war.In this novel Scott St Andrew faces a choice - he has been approached by the Colonial Wardens to join their organisation and switch sides in the conflict. For Scott, while he can appreciate their aims, this means betraying everything of moral importance to him. This is basically a book of difficult choices. We meet old characters from book 1 as well as some new important people as Scott shifts though a myriad of plots and betrayals.Although the constant battle scenes can be wearying and somewhat depressing with all the loss in lives and how little they really achieve, this book rattles along at a fast pace and keeps you wanting to know how it ends. I'll be very interested to see where this war takes St Andrew in book 3, PATRIOTS IN ARMS."
3,Romantic fantasy but decent reading,"Knowing little about Russian history, it was interesting to me that R.Alexander was able to weave certified history into his romantic fantasy of a novel. I felt pushed to learn more about Russian history, but not to repeat reading this novel or other books by R. Alexander, I am sorry to say. This book was reviewed by a small book group that I belong to. The ladies all felt the same way about the novel. On the whole, looking at subjects that came to us when reading the book, we were astonished at the sheer waste of money on Romanov jewels and the terrible waste of millions of lives. Also, once again, we were sad that Russia has never managed to be anything but an autocratic society, whether the Tsars or the Communists rule. We hope for better government of that large land of such wonderful potential."
1,Why does everyone like this game,"It is has to many puzzle elements and the screen respawns everytime you leave making combat somewhat pointless. It is boring and the Final Fantasy Legend( 2 and 3 are best)& Adventure games are MUCH better, but are hard to find."
5,Criminalistics,"This book was great and has LOADS of information on all aspects of forensics, from its history, to DNA, Fiber, Computer forensics and just about any other type of forensics you can think of. Not only does it include a basic background of all these fields, but it also guides you to more advanced teachings in a way that does not have you getting lost along the way. Great book, LOTS of information, easy to read."
4,by far one of the best drum n bass albums I have heard.,"I purchased this album four months ago after hearing his new mix tape (sick). It has not left my stereo yet. It mixes hip hop and abstract drum n bass together creating by far one of the best drum n bass albums i have heard in the five years that I have been listining to jungle or drum n bass. Anyone will appreciate and enjoy, not just jungle heads......."
4,"Quality, but weird little finger","I'll start off by reaffirming what everyone else says - but a size bigger. I bought a 2X and it they fit just right. Also, since it's leather it should feel even better while I break them in. My only complaint is that the little finger is weirdly long. I've never had issues like that in other gloves and I could really use that length in the middle finger instead. I could also use better placed padding on the palm, but it is sufficient. Otherwise they're great - light, sturdy construction, and great protection on the back."
4,Track and Artist listing,"Nothing Compares to You - 2 U (4:40)All That She Wants (6:19)Babe - Caught in the Act (4:26)Don't Speak Eric Stefani, Gwen Stefani - Clueless (3:48)Baby One More Time - Danceteria (3:25)Another Day in Paradise Phil Collins - Jam Tronik (5:59)Please Don't Go - K.W.S. (3:30)Because the Night - Jackie Moore (2:49)Only You 2005 - Ernest Kohl (3:42)Like a Virgin - Premadonna (3:29)Happy Children - Paolo Pelandi Peter Lion (5:25)Born to Be Alive - DJ Alvares (3:11)"
3,IRA typecast again,"As is often the case with British writers, the IRA is potrayed as a criminal gang. While this is a great read, well written and often thoughtful, Smith has not broken free of British propaganda and all his Irish characters a stereotypes of what British Intelligence would have us believe are crazed patriots. Such a shame even good books like this have the traces of MI6's dull thinking all over it, albeit unwittingly put there - I hope."
1,Terrible purchase,Received this tape and it did not work properly. Tracking was awful on tape and we had to throw it away. Owner misrepresented condition of product. I won't use this seller again.
4,great colorful essential for your kitchen,"This is a great tea kettle if you are wanting the high-quality of Kitchenaid with a fun color! The color displayed is very close to the real orange color in the picture -- so you will not be disappointed. It is a very sturdy kettle and easy to use, the handle and pour spout are rubberized so you will not burn your hands. Overall, worth the price!"
5,Truly a Great House CD,"I have had this cd since it came out. As others have said, this CD bridges people to electronic music. This cd was not that transition for me, but I can clearly understand why it could bridge any gaps in people's musical tastes. It's smooth and energetic. One that will be listened to by me for years to come. There is not a bad tracked in the mix."
1,Waste of money,Not a good product. Tried to get it straighten out like it looks in the picture so it would be a rectangle and the top piece broke. It does leave a great deal of gaps which defeats the purpose of purchasing it to have fresh air and not bugs.
1,"Awful Product, Don't waste your money!","This door was NOT what I expected. It looks so nice in the photo but in reality it doesn't work. The metal frame is so flemsy it won't hold the shape in the photo. The top kept falling over away from the door frame. The plastic pieces that fit on either side kept falling out, and the door ""handle"" that you see is just a piece of plastic. It did keep the bugs out but kept falling down when we went in and out of it. The white bar in the middle is just ribbon cause there is nothing there to sturdy the rest of the frame to keep it up. Finally sold it for $5 to someone desperate for something. HA! Warning it does NOT do what the picture shows."
5,The best available book on the roman army,"I have many books on the roman army but this one is by far the best. As the other reader pointed out this book has a completely different approach from the illustrated uniform and equipment guide which is very common. It examines the army from a much more humane perspective, exploring how the roman soldiers acted under the enormous strain of the bloody hand-to-hand combat. I could not praise this work enough. I only hope Mr.Goldsworthy would write onother book on the subject."
5,The Best,"I bought this cd for the song ""Supermodels"".When I listenend to the whole CD I was hooked.This cd has some of the best songs I've ever heard.I like Britney and Christina but,this talented 19 yr old writes her own material. 1.Closer To Myself-This one of the best songs on the album. 2.Supermodels-This song is the reason i bought the cd. 3.Wonderland-Not my favorite but,still really good. 4.Hollywood-Great song 5.Honest-Beautiful song.It is absolutly great. 6.The Second Day-This is abeautiful song where her voice really shines. 7.It's Not The Time-This is a really good song. 8.On My Bones-This song is so honest and it has great lyrics.

4,Bugs is back and he's better than ever!,Game graphics are great. Bugs and other characters look great in color. Watch out for Elmer's cork gun! Fudd is Badddddddd!
3,"Long, selective history of British India","Raj is too long to be a ""good read"" (it comes to 647 pages of small print) yet too anecdotal and selective to qualify as real scholarship. It is based almost entirely on British sources, and tells the story of the Raj from a British perspective, with very little insight or information on Indian opinion. Much of the book is devoted to military history, with almost nothing about economics or colonial administration (although there is an interesting sub-chapter on the culture of the Indian Civil Service). That said, the book is well-written and lively, James isn't shy about stating his opinions, and readers who like popular histories of the British Empire might want to try Raj out. Other readers should wait for the paperback version or pick up the hardcover after its remaindered."
3,"Good overview, well written, sometimes arcane",Excellent history. I've always had an interest in British India and James's book fills in a whole lot of gaps. He begins with the emergence of British power in the middle of the eighteenth century and goes all the way through the Second World War. The focus is as much on England as it is on India and as you would expect in a book of this size and sweep there are a few dry spots. It's evident that James in a military historian as he tends to drone on over rather arcane military maneuvers that don't really add to the movement of the story.My guess is that an Indian historian would write a very different book (and likely has) but I found the book very readable and interesting. Though overly detailed in spots James walks a skillful line between plot and detail and offers an excellent addition to the library.
3,"Solid power/thrash metal album, but nothing you haven't already heard","2004's State of Mind was the debut (and to date, only) release from Chicago-based metal band Rival. The band had a fairly standard power/thrash metal sound that seemed to mix equal parts Judas Priest and Metallica. Barely clearing the 30-minute mark, State of Mind features 9 fast-paced metal songs full of speedy, thrashing riffs, gruff vocals, and aggressive lyrics. It's totally predictable, but still undeniably metal.I ran across State of Mind in a dollar bin, and don't regret picking it up. That's about the strongest recommendation I can give the album though. If you're a fan of this kind of power/thrash metal (think Agent Steel, Imagika, and Hellrazor), State of Mind is worth trying if you find it cheap, but it's just not original enough to be worth tracking down and/or paying full price. Rating: 3/5"
2,Shabby Binding,"I can't comment on the contents of this book because I'm an admin and I ordered the book for a technical person on my team. I returned the book because the binding was inferior. I know it is paperback but the glue was not applied consistently and if and when pages fall out, it's usefulness is compromised. I've ordered this book for other technical people but this is the first time I've returned a copy."
5,I agree that you should update to DVD for it & Winds of War,"This production was not an enjoyable as Winds of War, but did tell the end of the story. It and its predecessor would do well in DVD format, particularly because of its length and storage space. Anyone agree?"
3,Reality,"The story as a TV series has numerous flaws; acting casting etc. However,one cannot help but to be moved and shaken at the depiction of the death of Aaron Jastrow. For all of the nay sayers who cry that the holocaust did not happen and who harbor any Anti-Jew or Anti-Semetic ideas, and for those of us who don't, I would make those scenes required watching.V.Craig"
2,War & Rememberance,"We were very disappointed - it seems that a considerable amount was left out, whar happened? The TV series included considerable more than was in that set of DVD's. We saw them a couple of weeks ago and are still quite angry!"
3,Good reference book,"I haven't read every single recipe in this huge book. It is filled with hundreds (maybe thousands) of recipes, but the best part of the book is the sections that give general knowledge about cooking: how to cut up meat, what various herbs are used for, etc. Very educational for a beginner cook.The recipes I've had a chance to read, though, seem a little to ""gourmet"" for me--you know---the kind that includes ingredients that you don't have on the shelf and cost a lot of money at the store. I much prefer recipes that are good, but can be made from ingredients I already have."
3,"Absolutely love it, but....","Several years ago I had a spiral-bound version of this book. I absolutely loved it, to the point that I considered it light reading material (lol). I lost it when I moved home from college. I bought this version and I'm a little confused. This is supposed to be the original (I think), but something's different. Some of the recipes seem to be missing, as well as some of the delightful stories and commentary."
5,My reference cookbook; get the original,"If you had to choose only two cookbooks for a young adult setting up his/her first household, I would recommend one of the older Joy of Cooking books (pre-1997) and the Better Homes and Gardens New Cookbook. Joy of Cooking provides all the information you need on measurements, substitutions, ingredients, and basic techniques, such as how to make a roux. I have a 1984 version, which I love. When the 1997 revision came out, I rushed out and bought it, too, assuming I would pass on my older one to a young cook. I am so glad I didn't give my first one away! Not only do I think it is a better cookbook with more useful recipes, but it is also built better. The newer version's binding quickly fell apart."
2,"Beware, this is not a new book!","The description of this spiral-bound version of The Joy of Cooking says it was Published in November 1997, but it was not. It was printed in 1997 but is a very old edition of the book printed on very cheap paper. A big disappointment if you thought you were ordering the new version of the book."
1,Sucky,"They sent me the wrong book, and it would have cost more to send it back than to keep the thing. Waste of time and money."
4,Joy of Cooking,Just what my daughter in law wanted. She grew up with this in her home and now wanted her own copy. She seems very happy.
2,don't get the comb edition,"Having worn out the large paperback edition of this cookbook, and being perpetually annoyed at the small edition's inability to stay open to the recipe I'm cooking, I was thrilled to find a comb edition of this book. (A cookbook that lays flat on the table - what a great idea!).Unfortunately, this great concept is completely undermined by a lousy execution. The paper in this book is dark and grainy, smoother than pulp paper, but just as unreadable. The text isn't in the large and easy-to-read font we know and love in the original book, but rather in a cramped and heavy typeface. The pages are so flimsy that I'm afraid to flip through the book for fear that I'll tear one out.The cooking information all seems to be faithfully reproduced. But definitely not the joy."
4,"Joy in having ""The Joy of Cooking""","My wife's 1975 edition fo Joy of Cooking started to fall apart (over a years ago) and she kept saying she wanted to g et a replacement. Well you can't get a 1975 first edition any more. So I got this one, and she is a happy as a clam."
2,Not a reference book,"This books' recipes are well organized. For example, they give you basic sautee chicken recipes and ask you to refer to sauce A, B, and C to complete the dish. So you can mix and match to your own tastes.However, this book is not very well written. The section on artichokes for example, is completely confusing. One major minus to this book is that its instructions are in paragraph format, making following them almost impossible. The instructions would be better if they are shown step-by-step."
4,Excellent cooking reference,Excellent basic reference to cooking a very wide variety of foods for a very wide variety of purposes. Few books fulfill the job better.
5,"Priceless, easy to read, Life Guidance","This book has blessed me beyond measure. It gives inspired and scriptual answers to questions young people have and motivation to live life God's way. The section titles are: God's purpose for the youth, conflict with sin, gaining victories, walking in the light, preparation for life work, service, health and efficiency, devotional life, stewardship, home life, dress and adornment, social relations, courtship and marriage. It is an awsome book that has caused me to sqirm in my seat with conviction, but then move on and overcome. Please buy this one for sure.~Ashley Stephens"
4,readers digest,On my subscription name shows it will expire in Oct l3. I just got my first copy and it is the Dec issue. I will need l more issue. Please adjust
2,RD has changed,"Reader's Digest just gets worse every year and it is a shame. It once was a great magazine. Now each issue is more ad intensive than the one before. Now I'm not against viewing more ads to keep my cost for the subscription down, but RD has abused the practice. You must remove at least 20 cardboard inserts before you can even look for the stories. It is so bad you can't tell a story from an ad. If they would take out a half the ads, the rest is great. It is very close to not being worth the effort, the price of $5 is almost too much!"
5,A WONDERFUL TRADITION,My father always kept his subscription for Readers Digest and it is one of the first magazines I ever read. I love the variety of this mag. There is a little something for everyone.
2,"Not fun to read, too many ads!","I am not enjoying my subscription to this magazine. There are so many advertisements you can hardly open the magazine without opening ad's, it is actually difficult to open the stories. It is really distracting and makes for a most unpleasant reading experience.The stories are okay, and there is a little bit of good humor but the design detracts from these points. I am really disappointed. There are better magazines if you want to read, this one is good if you like lots of special paper stuffed in, advertising medications!"
3,"Reader's Digest used to be a premier rag. Lately it's ""Just Okay"" but I hold out hope they'll improve again!","Everyone has experienced Reader's Digest. It's a refreshing rag to learn about new stories and the Laughter section is always welcome. I've seen more Reader's Digests in peoples bathrooms all over the country (and in my own). Why is it we all keep this mag handy when otherwise predisposed? Probably because we can always find an article just the right length while we're going ! ha!The magazine has become skinnier with yet more pharmaceutical ads. When they do away with all the drug marketing and restore the number of articles and sections to the quantity of yesteryear, it'll be a superb mag again."
1,Readers Digest,"The best I can say for the Digest is ""It's fair, not great or terrible, just fair."" I won't be renewing my subscription."
2,Catalog with good articles,"I have enjoyed RD for more than 20 years. It seems there are more ADs than articles now.It is annoying to browse RD to find out article pages. this is just too much.This is a catalog with good articles.If they keep decent ratio between ADs and articles, I'm willing to pay more."
1,Where do I begin?,"I was horrified to find an ad in the December 2011 issue for something you'd expect to see in a porn book. I threw the magazine in the garbage. Never again will I allow a copy of Reader's digest in my home. This magazine use to be respectable; something you'd keep on the coffee table. Now it's more likely to be kept under the bed, if you allow such things in your home. How disappointing."
2,Is A DVD-R that does not play on newer systems,"Our 2 year old loves parts 1-9. So we purchased the rest for his birthday. However this set is not a manufactured DVD, but a DVD-R (so it has a blue sheen). It did not play on 2 DVD players and 1 computer. Only our oldest computer could read it. While this happens with recordable discs sometimes, one does not often see this in things bought from Amazon. the production/ casing says "" approaching 2 million sold"" and ""DVD video"" not DVD-R.A real dissapointment and we will not be buying any other TMBV products in the future"
3,TAG's - How it works.,"Suitable for people interested in knowing how it works TAG technology. Brings a good detail to facilitate understanding. Necessary basic knowledge of electricity, magnetism and circuits with transformers."
1,Very small book,"This book is less than 1/2"" thick. I gave it a low rating because of the cost. ...The information is very basic and the equations simple."
5,Unpredictable lives up to its name!,"With his harsh style and Flowing lyrics, Mystikal has helped to elevate the No Limit record label's status to top-notch with this new CD Unpredictable. Favorites: The Man Right Chea, Ghetto Child, Born to be a Soldier, Here We Go"
2,Not one of Georgette's best.,The book is way too long winded. Too much detail about secondary characters and not enough about the main two. I was somewhat disappointed. Not one of her best. Georgette Heyer still remains one of my favorite authors.
5,Invaluable tips to successfully secure funding,"""Dee and Brian have diligently researched and compiled a manual for all entrepreneurs seeking Angel funding and advice. While most books on Angels and venture capital focus on abstract concepts and financial theory, this one is directly relevant to real situations and contains invaluable tips to successfully secure funding for many ventures in a difficult environment.""Frank A. McGrew IVMemphis Angels"
2,Get a standard DOD fuzz pedal instead,"All the DOD ""genre"" pedals have the same problem: in my experience, they basically are the same as the standard DOD effects pedals, but with a particular enhancement wired in. In other words, a standard DOD fuzz pedal can do whatever this pedal does, except the standard one has more range."
2,IT IS A GOOD EFFORT,"THIS ALBUM IS FROM THE LATE 1950'S IT WAS THE START OF THE MANY BOGUS,DUMB COMMERCIAL ELVIS ALBUMS THAT RCA/BMG HAS PUT OUT.IT HAS GOOD SONGS BUT IT STILL NEED MORE SONGS THAN TEN(1950'S LP ONLY HAD FEW SONGS)."
2,Great addition for a red kitchen,"I bought these pans a little over a month ago. I love the color and they cook very well. I have mixed feelings about the lids simply because I am used to glass lids and being able to see into the pot w/o opening the lid. Other then that I'm good.*-*-*-UPDATE*-*-*After less then a year I had to replace these with a better quality set of pans. I do still love the color but aside from that they're practically useless for any full time cooking. The teflon peels, the pans warped, the color flakes off, honestly of all the kitchen aid products I own these have by far proven to be the worse.I ended up purchasing the cuisinart hard anodized set. Far better even though they are less appealing to my overall color scheme they are worth it. See the link belowCuisinart 66-17 Chef's Classic Nonstick Hard-Anodized 17-Piece Cookware Set"
2,Doesn't cleanup well,"I purchased this product a little over a year ago. It cooks well, looks beautiful. But, after repeated use, the red turns to an off-pink. KitchenAid support doesn't offer any suggestions for bringing the pans back to the original color. Overall, its a good product. Just don't purchase it in a colored version."
1,Red finish fades in dishwasher,"beautiful out of the box. after a year of use, the red finish has faded to an ugly dull shade. and - who wants to hand-wash their pots and pans? no thanks, KitchenAid."
5,No joke,"You are going to love this cd! Sample the cut titled ""1968"". Every song on this cd is fantastic. I had only ever heard of Pete Elman and his work on Acorn Records, this was a real eye opener. Trust me, you will enjoy this cd!! It is a great driving cd!"
3,nibble rings,Both of my rabbits had a very hard time eating these. Since they are so small they couldn't pick them up. I put them in their grain and they still wouldn't eat them.
5,Couldn't put the book down,Holy Vulnerability should be a must read for anyone who is serious about their Christian walk and willing to move in the power of God. Flynn has a wonderful healing ministry and signs and wonders follow him. He is a true believer. His book is easy to read yet has many good practical ideas to follow. You will be closer to God by the end if you just act on his suggestions. ENJOY.
4,Difficult Setup,"Purchased to use with AT&T internet. It was difficult to setup. Took about an hour along with AT&T customer service rep. to get it up and running. Once setup, tt worked fine. Best price I found for this unit."
3,too slow,I installed this dsl unit and the maximum it gave me was 1mb; I installeed the older one that I had and it gives me upto 3mb.I tried to play with the setup but it did not help.I would not recommmend it.
5,Happy with the purchase,"I could not wait for the arrival of this modem. My previous one was disconnecting me every hour or so! Now I do not have a lost signal or interrupted download!Setup was easy! I did not even need to call my ISP's tech support. Wireless working (good enough for my needs).Shipping was fast, good packaging. As I said, I am happy with this purchase."
1,Bad specified,"I've bought this product to use with a cable modem. When I was checking the product's specification on Amazon's page, there was NOWHERE telling that it only worked with phone line.Now I'm having to sell it at a low price."
5,D-Link DSL-2640B ASDL2/2+,"Purchased this after I understood I'll have to pay AT&T; monthly for my modem and then at the end I don't even get to keep it.After searching for several options (not many) I chose to go with this one for an ADSL/WIFI Router combo.First, using the auto-connect ADSL function it did find the correct protocol and I was connected to AT&T; site, after registering I only needed to change the PPP username and password to the ones you make while registering and that was it!Got it up and working including the WIFI in about 10-15min and it's working great.I installed several routers before, D-Link is usually pretty straight forward."
2,If you want a modem/router that can only had one task at a time,"then the D-link 2640B is for you. I bought this item since I had gotten several years of good service from my old D-link wireless router (no built-in modem), but this definitely is a disappointment. If you try and do two or more things at once, like watch a youtube video and also surf a little, one of the two will time out and give you a time out fault screen. It works, so I gave it two stars instead of one, but my advise, pass this modem/router by."
5,Significant improvement,Decided to replace an aging DSL modem from Verizon and Linksys wireless with one unit. The system was easy to install and setup. I've seen a significant improvement in download speeds.
3,Worked good the first 12 months,"This modem worked good once setup. The setup could be difficult for a novice. I work for an ADSL provider in a small town, and we had deployed 50+ of these. On at least 80% of these the power supplies failed within a year. Just a warning. They do perform well with an operational power supply."
5,I loved this cd,"This was a great cd because it brings back a lot of memories. I am from the Pine Point community (Mamou,La) so it really hit home. Andrus (Beau Jocque) was my second cousin and his passing just broke my heart. Actually all of his music that he's ever recorded has been ""off the hook"". As a matter of fact since I've been away from home I listen to his music all of the time. It just makes me feel at home even though I'm not at home. Thanks Andrus for making me and all of your fans learn to appreciate good music again. You will be sadly missed. Much love,Melissa"
2,Couldn't find on iTunes,I bought this CD for one song only. Too bad the song I wanted wasn't on iTunes. I guess the CD is ok.
2,Doesn't quite fit our needs,"We bought this product to replace a Garrity spotlight that had served us well for several years.Pros: It's very lightweight with a comfortable ergonomic grip.Cons: It would be better if there was a way to lock it into one of the three power levels. Having to click the button three times to get full power is nothing but an annoyance - we want full power immediately when checking on noises out in our horse pasture. Plus, as other reviewers have stated, recharge time is too long, and the battery life is far less than our previous spotlight."
2,Title is intriguing but a little misleading.,"I was thrilled at the sound of this book and expected it to be filled with succint wisdom -- the type of wisdom you receive from friends' emails, save to a file or print, and never organize into a book. However, it was really several longer narrations of the author's opinion on selected topics. All in all, I found it to be of little value and quickly relegated it to my attic collection."
5,A book for all horse people,"I absolutely adore this book. I got it for my birthday a while ago, and if I could only keep one of my horse books it would be this one. She recognizes that some people are ""allergic"" to Dressage and explains how it can help them. Personally I am a Western Pleasure person but I have found it to be a great help with my horses. I could also really see this being of great help even to gamers. Now I want all of Jane Savoie's books!"
1,the mayan oracle,"THese are stupid, big cards I thought these were something other than they turned out to be. they are a waste of time."
4,A definitive history with a few factual errors,"Well... a definitive history since 1954 of the +2 cars. However a few little errors bug me about it. After reading Pat Braden's technical accounts of the Giulietta and Giulia, I notice that a few things about the Veloce's are gotten wrong in this account concerning technical features of the most sporting versions of the production cars. Which leaves me wondering... is anything else slightly off? I don't know enough about the Suds or the GTA's, GTAms to say, but I will have to dig now to find out."
5,Vivid - Promo Video,"Basically is the promo video of the Vivid album. Includes 1. a flash of Living Colour 2. a collection of their songs and observations : middle man, cult of personality, funny vibe, broken hearts (live), open letter to a land lord. Video was recorded in 1989. Hi-fi Stereo."
2,Disappointing,"Let me start off by saying Tina Fey and Steve Carell are two of my favorite actors. I have seen almost all of their work and you can imagine how excited I felt when I heard they would be starring in a movie together. However, after watching this movie I felt disappointed. It has a few funny moments, but not enough to make it satisfying. The jokes seem to fall short and it got boring near the end. The story was confusing and didn't seem to really flow. On the other hand, I give this movie credit for possessing realistic and relatable characters. It is about the stereotypical boring suburban cople who are finding it difficult to find any spark in their relationship. Their date night gone wrong brings them to realize they still love each other. Overall, this movie is somewhat entertaining, but is ultimately forgettable. Woth a rental if you're bored and can't think of anything else to watch."
4,good. :),i watched this movie with my boyfriend and i really liked it. he barely likes movies like this and he liked it too. :)
4,ok story but great actors,"This is an ok story. If you're married, it will be something you can relate to. Pretty predictable. The standard ""Saturday Night Live' movie, really.What makes this story work is the great actors. Tina Fey and Steve Carroll are great. Mark Wahlburg is great. If you like any of these actors, it's worth a rental."
3,Pretty good (for a Steve Carell movie),"2.5 stars. I don't usually like Steve Carell movies but I do like Tina Fey. Overall, the movie is moderatly entertaining. There were a few LOL spots and some parts that were painful to watch. The plot gets absurd in parts and the writing isn't brilliant but it's better than a poke in the eye with a sharp stick (as my grandmother used to say.)Not bad but not recommended."
2,Ok,"For some reason, we could not get into this movie. We kept falling asleep after trying to watch it on a few different occasions. Whatever the reason, we finally gave up."
2,not all that funny,"I think they were going for some kind of action movie here........ and missed. Not the best movie, I only took the DVD hard copy because it was just 2 dollars over the rental price and I got both."
1,Dumb,"I did not like this movie. I found it tasteless, unoriginal, and a waste of Steve Carrell's time. When date night 2 comes out, stay in."
4,Got to love amazon.,Ordered it with less than a week until christmas and received it in time for gifting. The movie itself is so much fun definitely worth watching.
2,Not something I would watch again,"I am a big Tina Fey and Steve Carell fan however this movie falls pretty flat on all counts. I would not recommend spending your money on the DVD, maybe rent it if you are determined to see it, but if you didn't see it you wouldn't be missing anything. Stick to 30 Rock or the Office for the moment for your Fey/Carell fixes."
1,Another book with inflated amazon.com reviews,"This book isn't terrible, but it's hardly authoritative. It's a straight rehashing of the basics of newswriting, no doubt taken mostly from journalism textbooks. The advice isn't bad, but it's given with little flair, and the writing examples (from the author's own clips) are dull and uninspiring.It's like an extended high school report -- the author is obviously not an expert on the subject, and she pieced together information from better books to make this one. But even on those terms, the book doesn't succeed, because the advice is spotty and unconvincing."
2,"nice beat, poor lyrics","i really like the beat that this band has and their concerts are really cool, but has anyone really read the lyrics. They are NOT truly christian lyrics. There is nothing ghastly wrong with them, but they are not christian. Some of the songs sorta hint at being christian, but then she'll say something later in the song that will smash that belief. ""Send Angels"" and ""Concrete"" are the only 2 songs that could be remotely considered Christian. Some of the words on ""Concrete"" I actually found offendsive. The CD had the air of being good, but not being Christian. Maybe I am not educated enough to perceive the hidden meanings in the songs, but I have never had a problem decerning the meanings of the other 34 CHRISTIAN Artists that I listen to. I hate to put in a poor report when so many people love this album, but someone has to say it. I hope that their next album will contain some righteous songs and not just some secular ones."
2,Generic Music,"This CD by Plumb is musically generic. I was surprised after listening to it that it was classified as a Christian CD. ""Send Angels"" is a blandly amusing atmospheric music with sonic keyboard washes and a long irritating blank space of over 5 minutes silence to get the end of the track. Of the other songs, the only one that stays with me long enough to recognize is ""Concrete"" with its driving guitars and some memorable lyrics, ""Hold tight to your convictions, hypocrites in all directions, Cling to the things your father taught you, confess your sins to the One who bought you."" Even as interesting as this track is, it still makes the Christian faith sound more like spiritual slavery rather than a joyful attitude of faith. Perhaps on other sets, Plumb comes up with a formula that works. Here, the music is generic and forgettable, neither moving in its message nor pleasant in performance. Taxi!"
5,It's Like Candy To My Ears!,"ATT: All PLUMB Lovers! There is going to be another PLUMB CD out, I have all ready heard it and seen it. It is GREAT. It is not out in the stores yet so watch out for it, it will be called: CandyCoatedWaterDrops"
5,PLUMB'S DA BOMB,"PLUMB IS ABSOLUTLY AMAZING. IF YOU ARE AN ALANIS MORRISETTE OR GOO GOO DOLLS FAN, YOU BETTER BUY THIS CD!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Oddly Depressing yet interesting,"This is not upbeat stuff. Amidst the depressing and self pitying lyrics is some interesting music. In an era when you are lucky to have 3 worthy songs on an album, Plumbs self titled album has 5 that are worth a listen musically. Keep the razor blades away from teenage girls in your home if your going to buy this one.I am not a teenage girl, so I can't tell if these lyrics will send girls into the abyss or pull them away from the edge of it. As I said, musically there are 5 interesting songs, but I don't see anyone getting lifted up with any of this music.As a parent, I would say check out the lyrics at your favorite lyric website before buying. Make sure they are OK. I bought this based on a recommendation for my 11 year old daughter, but did not give it to her."
1,a piece of junk,"Dont ever buy this product. It comes with a packet of junk softwares. Take for example audio player. It can only play files which has a frequency of 44.1KHz and data rate of 96kbps to 128kbps. However there are some awesome products out there, but since sony doesnt provide their API, these products dont work for nz90.Battery life is terrible. Even when your battery is %80 percent charged, you cannot use flash to take a picture. I think with fully charged battery you can only take 5 ( yes it is 5) pictures. Then your battery is totally gone.There are so many negatives for this products that I can write 5 paged on that!!!!Exteremely disappointed user of nz90.Luckily I saved so many friends of mine to do the same mistake!!!"
2,Chinese made,"As others have written, they are slightly smaller than the ""real"" Pinkys, they are slightly ""dead,"" but worst of all the pink outer color comes off with use. The balls become a dull greenish gray. These are made in China. I use them for throwing with the dog, and with all of the reports of Chinese toys using lead-based paint I have stopped using them and will throw the remaining 10 balls away. I can't afford the possibility of lead poisoning my dog."
1,Terrible smell,"I bought these balls because I thought they'd be small enough for foot therapy. They are not.I took one out of the bag and it smelled, like gasoline. I've left the one out of the bag to see if the smell would disapate.It did not. So far it's been 36 hours and it still has a strong gasoline smell. I checked the package to see what theywere made of to make them smell that way but couldn't find any information except that they were made by a companyin China. Since I can't use them I was going to give them to my granddaughter to take to daycare to share with her classmatesbut I'm worried these aren't safe for children....or pets.I'm going to give the one another 24 hrs to see if the smell goes away. If I can't send them back, I will probably just throwthem away. I sure don't want to make any children or pets sick."
5,Great Recommendation!,"I enjoyed this book. I couldn't put it down until I finished the story. I also read the previous books in regards to the reverend. Looking forward to an additional sequel. Curtis Black was involved in quite a lot of wrong doing. However, I do not want to see Charlotte get away with pinning that baby girl on him."
4,Best Kept Secret - You Definitely Will Reap What You Sew,"I enjoyed this 3rd story of the life and times of Rev. Curtis Black. When I was told this book was out, I was like ""what else could Ms. Roby possibly do with this character?"" Well I found out. More Drama! I read this book in one day. I wont spoil the story, but karma is a trip. What goes around definitely comes around. I felt sorry for Curtis, but he finally felt the pain he caused Tanya and Mariah (his 1st and 2nd wives).Charlotte was something else. I surely did not expect her to be the way she was. Ms. Roby really outdid herself. At the end she still was scheming and lying. Curtis would truly kill Charlotte if he knew what she did regarding Baby Marissa.If you liked Casting the First Stone and Too Much of A Good Thing, it is a must that you purchase this book to see what happens with Mr. and Mrs. Curtis and Charlotte Black."
5,Three stars? are you kidding? Ms Roby has got it going on!!,Please don't be misled by Lisa Wilson's review!! Sistah Roby has not let her readers down!!! She will hold your attention throug each and every page. The good reverend is back.......Keep on keeping on Ms Roby...
1,the best kept secret,This book was not in very good conditionIt had something spilled on it. Should have been tossed otherwise I like the books I have gotten before
4,Adults,"More for coaches or for parents of players. My kid didn't read it, but I did and found it helpful in explaining points of the game. Good buy, but don't expect the kids to read it."
2,No Win7 64-bit driver,"The DSI Pro II is not a terrible camera, but:1. It's behind the times. Spend the money on something newer, even if that costs more.2. It runs under 32-bit Windows. Period. And Meade so far has not been forthcoming with a 64-bit driver.3. Meade is notoriously unfriendly to software developers, further compounding the driver issue, greatly.In summary: steer clear. You get what you pay for. Meade has been blowing it for several years now; go with another vendor."
3,Not Easy to get good results,"The first CCD camera did not work consistently (it shorted out), and I had to return it for a replacement.So far I have not gotten the results Meade shows on their web site. I am not satisfied with this moderately expensive gadget, and hope I begin to get better results with practice."
5,a lot of fun,My sister gave my 4 year old (and 9 mos old) this book. My 4 year old loves it and we have talked about the book alot. I like the illustrations as well. Recommended.
5,A great resource!,"Having a 4 year old son with hyperlexia, I found this book exceptional. It includes information about hyperlexia, its treatments, and school related guidance Information is chunked in easy to read format with practical suggestions for implementation in the home.Hyperlexia has so little information and resources, this is truly a one of a kind book."
5,Mr. Sinatra engineered a phenomenal train layout,"At a visual level, it doesn't matter so much that this is Frank Sinatra's Lionel train layout; Turn off the sound, and I'm sure there are a few other collectors who would have the means to build a magnificent layout this way. But what adds so much depth to this wonderful presentation is learning the human story behind Frank's poor youth, and his desire to create later in life a collection of what he yearned for as a boy, yet could not afford. The layout is spectacular, and Frank insisted on keeping every train in tip-top condition so that any train, old or new, could be run for a visitor. This is a museum in more than one sense; the trains are certainly collector grade (and you get to see them all), but it also gives you pause to reflect on how a world-class celebrity would retreat from his stressful life to a small guest house that contained a youthful escape back to the streets of Hoboken."
3,Don't expect any miracles,"Hello,I had very little knowledge of cars before I've bought this book, and after reading it (well some of it - it is very long and tedious and fool with obvious ""insights"") I stil have very little knowledge. Maybe this book will be good for people who never heard before that cars existed because ~80% of this very l o n g b o o k is bla bla bla (how to clean your car (?!), how to select a garage (?!) - what kind of expert do U need to tell U thos kind of info ? )another problem is that it speaks about the ""classical"" engines - most of the cars from year ~90 and more are not using the system as described there and are more complicated (carburator, distributor ) to handle."
2,Container is laughable,"The container this spice comes in is a joke. I had to re-seal it into a plastic bag so my whole house doesn't end up smelling like Hing. I mean, I know it's imported from the third world country but, come on! Even they HAVE to be able to mold plastic into more usable shapes and use better plastic to do so. This low ""quality"" packaging would be hard to find even in the middle of the jungle!"
3,Not exactly a substitute for garlic and onion,"I am allergic to garlic and onion, among other things, and found this product after researching on the web for substitutes, as I am tired of bland food! Articles I read suggested this spice as an alternative, particularly for garlic. They warned that it was very pungent, and lessened so during cooking. They weren't kidding! I had to double zip lock bag them, even in their containers, to tone down the smell!Product arrived on time, but the containers are almost impossible to open, so plan on destroying them and putting the product into something else. They do add nice flavor, but it is distinctly Indian, so for me, doesn't mesh well with, say, Italian dishes. I loveIndian food, though, and look forward to finding recipes that I can use this spice in."
2,spice,"Since there wasn't any ingredient listing, I didn't know I couldn't use it until it arrived. I am gluten free...sorry!"
5,"A pleased reader from Cambridge, MA","Tabs, flaps, surprises and a scary owl are part of the fun of this well-conceived book. The pop-up engineering is really amazing and the illustrations are scientifically accurate as well as beautiful. Children love finding the hidden animals and there is so much variety and excitement in these 12 pages, that it will be enjoyed as much by adults as by children. It is a wonderful book for a parent or grandparent to share with the young ones."
1,Broken!,"This glass bottle was broken after the first use!!It could be partly my fault since I tried to clean it using cold water right after using it, but still this glass is not strong enough to be called TEA POT!!"
2,first timer,wasn't really sure what to expect with never using ear candles before. Didn't really see a difference and felt the exact same. maybe I didn't do it right but def. won't do it again.
1,Not effective,"I gave these a try.. it does appear that the bottom of the candle fills up with ear wax, but in reality that is wax from the candle itself. We burned the other one to test out that theory and the two candles were identical in their contents, even though one had never touched an ear. Don't waste your money on ear candles."
4,Not bad,"I bought this item pretty much just for the skin, and not for the other features. I don't use the screen shield (the hard clear plastic piece), the stand, or the arm band, I just use the skin and the screen protector. As a skin it works very well. It fits well, but isn't super tight. This makes it easy to put on and you don't have any problem with the buttons like I've heard about in reviews of other skins. The screen protector is a pain in the rear to put on without air bubbles, but I believe that's going to be the case with any screen protector. Overall, I think it was a good value."
5,Outstanding value,"This skin fit my Creative Vision M perfectly! It has a nice smooth latex-like matte finish, a clear protector for the screen, and a nifty stand as well as wrist strap."
2,R U Still Listening? (Forget This),"While 2pac's lyrics shine through the songs, over half of the songs are overly repeditive both with the beats (which are simple and sound the same), a voice you hear on songs and interludes which makes it sound like someone was inhaling a little too much laughing gas, and lyrics which are filled with ""Bury me a G!"" and ""Thug Life Baby!""With stand out tracks ""Nothing To Lose (Disk one)"" and ""I Wonder If Heaven Got A Ghetto (Hip-Hop version -- disk two),"" it is still a nice CD, but I would recommend Better Dayz. The production is different which makes all the tracks stand out in thier own way and you will never put it down."
5,This cd was hot.,This cd was mad good. I thought the second cd was better then the first. The best songs probably being Do For Love and Don't Make Enemies With Me. If you love 2pac this is a must have.
2,Sorry Pac,"I love Pac,and think he's the best ever,but this cd isn't that good,the beats don't fit the delivery,if your so desperate to hear pac's voice again get it,but if not,get something before he died and had a say in what the beat was,and wasn't Suge making money off Pac's soul."
4,The Big Aircraft Carrier,"This is an excellent movie. Our family has enjoyed it over and over and over . . . it is a little above our two year old, but he still likes to watch it. There are a lot of action shots which entertain him. My husband and I both work for the Navy and we found very informative and well done. We also own ""The Big Plane Trip"" from this same series and enjoy that as well."
3,"Hi, I wanna be Richard Pryor","Isn't it funny how Chris Rock has become the kind of stand up comic he used to make fun of on SNL, the kind of comic whose act runs the gamut from race jokes to jokes about racial stuff."
1,Dinky&Dinky is more like it,compared to Roll with the new this Disc is flat.he comes across like he is just Grand-Standing.No Sex was Kinda Catchy but the material Lacks any kind of Drive overall.I think Chris Rock is talented but he is a bit Overrated.
2,Wasnt what I expected,"Overpriced for the size. I was expecting a much larger container for the price I paid, but that could have been an overlook on my part. Haven't noticed a huge difference in breakdown that I was expecting either. Don't think I will buy this product again. Next time I will buy from the company that made my dog waste system."
5,Pedro Infante as his best,"A masterpiece! Pedro Infante's performance is absolutely remarkable. I've watched this movie over and over, and I cry every time. A must see movie, but make sure you have kleenex handy."
3,decent,"this is a very basic DVD player.its missing some very important things that i think all DVD players should include.first of all, component video out. second , a fully functional remote(no jog).finally, but not as important , DD decoder. look to the 550 to get all that plus a video noise filter to clean the picture up even more"
5,Shop practical and let your receiver do the rest !,"I purchased the dvps330 and I tell you I could not have made a better choice. I have it connected to the Sony str e725 receiver with built-in dolby digital and the picture and acoustics kick mucho-a$$. Remember all you want is compatibility and digital sound coming through your speakers.So why spend all this excess money on another dvd with features you dont really need, your choice in your receiver should hold its weight. Sony's dvp-s330 is an cut and dry choice."
1,Piece of Junk,This thing's a total piece of junk. It arrived rattling and quickly dislodged from its base. Tacky. You get what you pay for in this case. Avoid!
3,Little fun booklet,"This little booklet includes drawings and a short text on each page. It tells about Sunbonnet Sue's trying to find the perfect working space in her home. She moves from kitchen to living room and even does a stint in the bathroom... Most quilters will be familiar with this hunt for a space where you can spread your stuff out and be creative.This booklet makes a nice gift for a quilter, but there is no need to rush out and buy it. Get a fat quarter instead..."
3,seem ok,"They are all metal with plastic feet that lock into place.I am going to use these to display mounted photos on poster board so there won't be much weight on them.I think if one were to use a large picture frame it would be too much weight.11x14 size image will sit nicely but anything bigger will start to show it's problems.1) The legs are independent of one another which I like about tripods, but not small easels like this.The front two should be on the same plane while the rear leg should have some sort of lock to keep it in place.The easel is very upright so with the independent legs I think the slightest bump will send the tripod falling over.Do I regret this purchase for the price? No.Would I buy again? Doubtful, but you never know."
3,3 Stars for the material alone...,"Erratic performances mar this cast recording of a revue consisting of what was, up until then, the ""best"" of Sondheim. British accents make Sondheim's wonderful New York/Broadway vernacular sound way too prim and proper. Particularly egregious is the most overwrought ""Losing My Mind"" ever committed to tape. It's simply awful. Other peformances range from okay to ""yawn."" A better buy is the 1973 Sondheim benefit concert ""Sondheim Evening: A Musical Tribute"" (1973 Concert Cast)Warner Brothers CD (with a few bonus tracks; it's tough to beat Larry Kert, Angela Lansbury and other Sondheim show veterans' interpretations."
3,"Great production, not much else","Really? I think the guy has a totally awesome style and original sound, but if you strip down the fancy production, the actual SONGS are not that rememberable. I only hear one or two well written tunes on this hodge podge of wacky arrangements and unique textures. The kid certainly has talent, though. Ryan."
3,Is something missing?,"Compared to most other albums out there, this is almost a work of genius. But by the standards this band has established for itself, it's slightly disappointing. After about 20 listens, I still feel that something is missing. Maybe the songs are not that strong, once the novelty of production wears off. This album sounds too complicated for its own good, as if they (or just Matt) were trying to prove something. Over-indulgence brought on by a too-generous budget, perhaps? My favorite Self album is the second one, Half-Baked Serenade--a perfect balance between production and songwriting skill."
3,"Not bad, but repetitious","After buying the ""Shrek"" soundtrack, and thoroughly enjoying it, I decided to buy separate CD's by artists on the soundtrack. I was not familir with most of the artists. The Self song on the soundtrack is ""Stay Home"". I couldn't find a Self CD with that song, so I read the reviews, and picked ""Breakfast With Girls"" as my introductory Self CD. It isn't bad. In particular, the lyrics are often clever. But most of the music seems repetitious and droning. I was a bit disappointed, given the playfulness of the song on the soundtrack."
5,Better than Italian I,"Having completed Italian I, my expectation was that Italian II would be a natural progression. I was not disappointed. e.g. Italian II Lesson 1 could be included in Italian I as Lesson 31 and so on (for my thoughts on Italian I, see my review).Italian II introduces the informal method of speaking Italian which is much more common (and hence useful) in today's Italy.While Italian I used the last 5 minutes of each lesson for reading/pronunciation exercises, Italian II (and Italian III) have dispensed with this and now use the whole 30 minutes for verbal learning.If you haven't been through Italian I, that's where you should start. If you enjoyed Italian I, then I thoroughly recommend Italian II !!"
5,Eye of the Albatross,"This is a stunning description of an even more stunning creature. Part scientist, part poet, part mystic: Carl Safina is an albatross's best friend. The reader is instantly and forevermore smitten. Read this book! You will fall in love with the world's most magnificent long-distance flyer-glider. You will not think of wind in the same way, nor gravity. You will become a more patient diligent steadfast joyous courageous human being."
2,Misleading wording on Amazon,"The humidifier pads are fine but I felt that the Amazon page for this item was misleading. It says ""Set of two"" and lists a price. The price is for one though, not for two. You will be charged twice the price shown. I think that's fraudulent."
1,"Kitchen etc can't pack, you will get your broken stuff later","I order 10 mugs and paid additonal $8 for shipping, I finally got it 13 days later (they used UPS ground even I paid for the shipping), and 6 out of 10 mugs were broken already when I opened the box. I very disappointed with Kitchen etc vendor due to its low quality and bad packaging and shipping methods.I have been a loyal Amazon customer over the years, I think Amazon should not use this vendor anymore, they are destroying Amazon's brand name."
3,"Good song, but I was expecting something different.","You take a risk ordering something off the internet. You can't always see what it has inside. Sometimes you can. This CD is great, there is no doubt of that, but I was dissapointed. Only one mix?! Then that""Backstreet Boys Album Medley""? What was that? I don't want to hear them talk! I want to hear them sing! I don't want a fake interview with song samples, I want another mix. If you want the CD for your collection, get it. But if you wanted it for remixes of the songs, don't. Track 1) Radio Mix (same as on the BSB CD) Track 2) Amadin's Euro Mix (awesome Techno mix) track 3) Backstreet Boys Album Medly (interview)"
2,DISENGAGED,"Love the wand, love it. Gets into tight spots, cleans well...but the head- well, it won't stay put. The end is a different scrubber material and it won't stay bonded to the softer foam. We've gone through abot 4 of the heads in the last month. Upside is that the heads are staying very clean, but it's kinda expensive.I've repaired one using high strength contact cement around the perimeter and it appears to be working well, but it's only been a week. We'll see......"
2,"Great Wand, Terrible Head Replacements","We have had this wand for about 2 years now and it works great--dispenses just the right amount of soap and can clean just about anything. PLEASE be aware that the scrubbing top replacement is very poor quality. The green scrubbing portion will almost always fall off within 1-3 weeks of normal use. I have glued them back on with Krazy Glue Gel several times, but they will fall off again and again. I am going to try the all blue replacement heads to see if the one piece construction will be better."
5,SO Handy!,"I love theses (along with the wand they attach to.) They make quick dish wash-ups really easy. Their sponge material is so much more workable than the brush types, and their round shape is more effective than wide, oval sponge types. Highly recommend."
2,Doesn't Hold Up To Scrutiny,"Once again Wayne Grudem is over-stating his case. There are instances to be sure of evangelical feminists going down the path to liberalism, but the general trend in recent decades and historically is not that at all. In fact, there have been many denominations and megachurches that have slowly moved to a more conservative stance on social issues, including the women's issue--not the least of which is the Southern Baptist Convention. And, there are those who in theory talk the talk of evangelical feminists but treat women very differently on a practical level, as was true in my own ministry (""My Calvin Seminary Story""). Grudem misses these nuances."
2,Product received didn't match image shown,"The item I purchased was an iGo phone charger. The item does work, but the product I received looks to be an older model of the iGo charger. I have had a wall iGo charger in the past. The photo was exactly like the one I used to own. However, what I received was totally different. And it also had lots of scratches on it, definitely a sign that it is NOT a new item. I'm very disappointed with this product/seller. I will be VERY hesitant (if I EVER) order from this seller ever again."
5,Jars just keep getting better...,"If it's by Jars of Clay, you know it's gonna be good. This CD is awesome! The first four songs are the best. My faves are Fade to Grey, Overjoyed, Portrait of an apology. They tried some new stuff, took some risks, and it turned out great!"
3,Not as good as their first,"The album's songs are still real, but they seem to be shying away from their Christian roots...the only song that is REALLY good is Five Candles. I hope that their next album is centered more on Christianity."
5,IMPOSSIBLY artistic - OVERPOWERING talents! Fantabulous!,Jars Of Clay's music has got true art written all over it. Dan Haseltine's (lead vocals) clear vocals make the songs jump at you. Jars have the ability to carry you with their songs. Their musical prowess is extremely refined (just have a look at their chord progressions in the songs!). I can't believe it took me 1 year to discover them after their previous debut album. They defined their own genre of music that to my experience has been unmatched! Truly my favourite band. Check it out to see how it could be yours! Gotta have it!
3,"Alright, but can't compare to the 1st.","Much Afraid was a strong album, but couldn't compare to their debut. I was kind of spoiled be the 1st one, and expected more from Much Afraid. I was impressed with the songs 'Crazy Times"", ""Fade to Grey"", and ""Truce""."
5,stop comparing,"first of all, stop comparing this one with the first one. they are awesome musicians to even come out with a second record to live up to the first. this one displays jars of clay exporing their music writing and adding a different sound, which isn't bad, it's just different. watch for their 3rd album out november 9."
1,Awful,"It is hard to believe that a company that endeavours to design ergonomic bike saddles manages to spend time and money in R&D; and ends up developing a medieval torture device. Well, let's go straight to the point:Pro: it's an interesting idea - in theory. That horn between your legs on conventional bike saddles is pretty uncomfortable and unnatural.Cons:1. The Easyseat quite hard and counter-intuitive to adjust. I spent at least some 30 minutes of adjusting, testing and re-adjusting to get a position that felt half-way natural2. The pads are way too hard3. After 30 minutes of riding I was in pain. There simply was no comfortable positionDo your buns and your spine a favor and spend the 30 bucks on a new cushion for your sofa."
4,Hobson Easyseat Ergonomical Dual Pad Saddle,I have tried several types of seats with no improvement. Bought Easyseat and a new world was opened. Have used several times and love it. Ordering one for my wife as well!!! The only reason not 5 stars is the the post adapter was not with it.....
2,Not what I hoped for,"My husband bought this seat for me because I have a tail bone that bruises easily,causing me to need cortisone shots.I didn't want to give up riding,since I love it.The seat did take the pressure off my tail bone,but it is so hard and uncomfortable my hip bones were killing me.It has no springs to cushion bumps,which after a while became painful.The movement did not bother me,but you must sit in one position on the seat or it is uncomfortable.If you do move, it took awhile to get back into a comfortable position again.It seems people bought this seat for different problems,which would account for some being happy with it.I haven't decided if I want to try to jerry rig it with padding or just change seats."
2,Hobson seat,This seat was 12 miles of absolute agony. Both seat halves wobulate as the ad info says but increased the effort considerably. I normally ride about 30 miles a day with a cushioned seat and thought the Hobson seat would be better for me. Maybe for others but not me. I could not maintain a solid seat which worked my body much harder.My rides have been much very pleasurable before this seat. I did try a couple much shorter rides first but was not sure I would like the seat. Sorry Hobson.
2,Saddle does not remain in set position,"The unit seems to be well made, but the mechanism that the two saddles ride on are under-engineered. There are two small thumbscrews used to secure the seat position, and the do not keep the seats positioned as set.I set the two saddles for a spacing comfortable for me, but after riding only a few yards, the seats had drifted tightly together, which nullifies their rocking capability.I tried many times, trying to tighten them as hard as possible, but the seats always moved tightly together."
3,They needed an audience!,"Based on the musicians, this should have been a terrific album. Unfortunately, it lacks the vitality and just plain good fun that cajun/zydeco should have. I suspect that too much time was spent getting the tracks studio perfect instead of the musicians just having a great time with one another."
2,Way smaller than expected,I was surprised that this was not a full sized spatula. Less efficient and harder to use than reg size.
1,Not a critique of the movie,"The low rating isn't for the movie. I suppose it could be a great movie, I just couldn't be bothered to watch it. The reason is simple, this is the worst looking DVD I have seen since the beginning of DVD history. Remember those old Scimitar and Manacy DVDs that looked like someone took an old VHS tape and mastered it to DVD? That's what this looks like. The picture is chock full of scratches and blemishes and all the colors are washed out. The sound is no better. Sadly, the folks over at Fusian seem so proud of their effort that they have a split-screen, special feature that A-Bs their ""remastering"" work. I will not purchase anything else from this company."
3,Left me wanting more :(,"Being a healer for the past 6 years, I was hoping to get a little more instruction on the ""how tos"" of this mans work. Although informative and a decent ""add"" to my collection, it was merely an overview into shamanism. Not bad but not great either, sorry to say."
3,OK to use some time.,I didn't think this movie was all that special. Not a bad way to spend a few hours but not a classic either.
3,Not Bad,"An ok little film, acting is not brilliant but it is an inoffensive film and fine if you are looking for something christmasy to watch, without being too preachy, too intense or too ridiculous"
4,Very Interesting,"I found this book to be well written and very interesting. Romo was clearly obsessed with being the best and not being beaten. He took this to insane heights. To the point of needlessly hurting people and by the time he got to the end of his career he had built quite a legacy of ""cheap shots"" and verbal abuse. What I found most interesting was his study and practice of ""repairing"" and preparing his body. Obviously he is a very intelligent man and I am fascinated by what he was able to accomplish"
1,Repair is a serious problem,"We had this unit for 100 days before we started to have problems. The warranty required we call the one and only support company. They led us through weeks of trying this, trying that, etc. They finally authorized a swap. Three weeks later they confessed that even though they promised a swap they had none in stock. I just received a letter saying if I send back my unit and the receipt they will reimburse me because replacement is not possible. If I don't have a receipt, they will send my refund once they receive everything from me."
4,Sync problem - more details,"First,let me say that Amazon Customer Service has been GREAT at helping to work out the problem here with my new S550D and the sync problem. I am very impressed with Amazon Customer Service and they deserve some good words. Five stars to them. Sony Customer Service is another story.You might want to check out the following URL for all the details on the ""sync"" problem. Reports here seem to indicate that corrected units may now be shipping but I have seen no official confirmation of that.I like the unit and have always liked Sony products. This problem will get fixed but it is frustrating to get expensive new equipment and have these problems. Other than the sync problem, I give the unit high marks."
1,Stay Away,"I couldn't go below 1 star! Mine broke and Sony can't fix it. Believe it or not, Sony will not do anything for me, no new player, no remedy to the problem of not reading CDs or DVDs. I though Sony was a good product, I was wrong. A warranty should be a binding document that is followed! F*^K Sony."
1,Extremely dissapointed with Sony S550D,"I received my Sony DVD player model S550D with a power source malfunctionig, as a result of Amazon excellent service the deffective player was substituted with a new one and all shipping expenses picked by Amazon. I could barely use the new Sony DVD player for three weeks when it experimented the same power source failure, as a result I am returning the second Sony DVD player and I do not plan on buying any Sony DVD player again. I had been a Sony fan all my life before these events."
5,The player Kicks a$$!,"After shopping for months and months, i dicided to get this sony model, and i don't regret it one bit. This picture is crystal clear, and the remote makes it worth the price of admission. I paid 399 for it at circuit city (sorry amazon!) Go out and but this one now!"
2,Plastic?? Really??????,"I like the others did not read the reviews on this item and bought it because of the name.... BIG MISTAKE... ok like ED said you really should be worried about static electricity with this product as it is not made out of polymer, so be carful and use some common sense. I would recomend buying the RCBSRCBS Powder Tricklerbecause at least it is metal. Also no where does it say this product is made out of plastic!!!!!"
5,great film,A romance for grown-ups. The film and the soundtrack are worthy of the praise received when the film first came out ('66) and it stands up to the test of time.
1,1 Star for the dubbed version; 5 stars for the French,"This is perhaps the best wedding of cinematography and sound track ever laid down on film. A simple but haunting love story told on a backdrop of wonderful musical compositions which carry the emotional payload. Why they ruined this near perfect blending with an English dubbing is unanswerable. Dubbing the dialogue was bad enough but dubbing the vocals was a high crime. ""A Shadow of Us"" in the original French is compelling. In English, it's a drunk singing to himself at the end of a bar.Should anyone find the original French with subtitles, please contact me. I've been looking for it for over 15 years."
5,Fantastic,Loved it as much as when I first saw it on the big screen at the Wintergarden in Sydney way back in the 60's
3,Slow but haunting.....,"The story moves slowly and predictably, but the cinematography and music makes it a classic."
5,Good Movie,"This is such a sweet romantic movie, I reccomend it for a date.but, just so you all know, there ARE French subtitles. Look in the language/set-up part of the DVD. There will be French Subtitles and English."
3,"Does the job, but it's loud.","Has good air flow when it's blowing towards you. However, it is pretty loud. I have right by my tv and I have to turn up the volume on my tv so I can hear it. I wish it was a hair cheaper than the 45 bucks I paid for it but whatever. I needed a fan for my room so this will have to do."
4,Good value,"I bought this fan for moving a large volume of air, which it does very well and the cost of the more powerful motor is what makes this fan more expensive.Don't get this fan if you want to hang it in the bedroom window and go to sleep; it's a little too loud for that.This fan would have got 5 stars if the slowest speed were slower & quieter."
5,Star is a Must-See For the Obsessive Romantic,"_Star_ is a beautiful movie that can be seen before or after reading the book. The characters are chosen perfectly and the acting is beautiful. However, the chemistry between characters is not what is should be. The actor that plays Spencer Hill has more chemistry with the woman he was tricked into marrying than he does with Crystal, his true love. This video tells the story of Crystal Wyatt, a shockingly stunning true country girl who loves her ranch and Spencer Hill, a handsome veteran of the Korean War who does not like to let anyone down, which the reason why this story ever happens in the first place. The singing in this movie is splendid, as well; it put tears into my eyes. This is my favorite movie and I recommend it full-heartedly."
2,"Good, but not good enough","I think of this book as something of a case study. However, it's not really written like a case study. It's written as a stand alone book. For that, I give this book only 2 stars. The E-Myth Revisited was an excellent book. Exceedingly worthwhile to read. This one was not. I could have done without it and, probably, so can you."
4,Bring back your youth,"See all my Idol reunion after 50 years. Yes they're looking old but the sound, the voice and the moved still almost the same. Love it."
4,Talk About Dysfunctional!!,"This is an excellent play with some phenomenal roles for actors. All of the parts are strong. A 16 year old trapped in a 60 yr old body; crazy family and a sweet ""boyfriend"". A strong play with excellent, layered parts."
5,Solid introduction to this field of biology,"Ok, I'm not done yet with the book but after two chapters, I could already share with people something: this book is a solid introduction to the field of biocomputing. It cover many aspects in 10 differents chapters (database, data mining, collaboration, read the table of contents).The autor is enthousiast about his field of research but he doesn't miss an important thing: criticism!! At the end of chapter, you have a small dose of concerns he have about biocomputing. Where we could make mystakes, what we should do?I'm about to choose if I want to do my master degree in this discipline and this book is great to introduce me with a large perspective to this branch of science.If you working in this industry, this book might be a little bit boring but even for me who work 5 years with computers networks and databases, both chapters about those technologies learned me something interesting so... I'm quite happy about my decision to acquire this book."
3,Useless for thick coated dogs (Siberian Husky),"Bought this for my Siberian Husky, and it DEFINITELY didn't work. I give it 3 stars because it turns out I should have known better. Flea collars are infamous for not working on thick coated dogs (I didn't know this at the time).Flea collars also contain neurotoxins as acting ingredients, which could have slightly deleterious effects on your canine friend over their lifespan. Some dogs also develop skin problems around the site of contact.If you have a thick coated dog I highly recommend ""FiproGuard 3-Month Dogs"". It is affordable and has worked like a charm for my Siberian Husky. It uses the same active ingredients as in Frontline, but for a better value."
2,Pal Joey,"""Pal Joey"" doesn't have the impact it had in 1940. Perhaps a first time reader will enjoy it more than I did. Evidently my memories of the stories is stronger then a new reading would warrant. The used Amazon copy is in good condition as I expect from Amazon."
4,"Ex- Clevelander ""Returns Home""",Growing up in Chagrin Falls (not far from Shaker)left me with an interest in northern Ohio. Great fun to read about familiar landmarks as a setting for Milan Jacovich's exploits as recorded by Les Roberts.
5,The corpse Bride,"One of my favorite Tim Burton films, great price and imagery. If you like tim burton you will love this film"
1,Openly Anti Christian Elements,"The movie has many none-too-subtle VERY anti-Christian elements, particularly in the typical Hollywierd portrayal of a clergymen (in this case, an Anglican cleric) as an angry, harsh, hateful, ugly, moronic old coot whom is obsessed with 100% perfectly executed ritual by laypeople; is proven untrustworthy; and bellows medieval superstitions and utter nonsense. -- Whatever happened to fun, even wacky family movies that portray both the Faith and clergy in a positive light?!I am sick of Hollywood rubbish like this! So, if you're a Christian, stand firm -- don't buy it!"
4,Enjoyable,Really fun- You can't compare it to Nightmare before Christmas though- that was just amazing. But creative as all and a great watch.
4,Cute,I'm a big fan of Tim Burton. If you like The Nightmare Before Christmas you'll probably like this one as well.
5,one of the best,"It's a twisting turning funny film... a young man is caught inside a weird mistake. Having marriage fright, he runs into the woods where he practices his proposal. He puts the ring on what he thinks is a twig, but is actually a dead woman who begins to rise and then says ""I do!"" That's all I can tell you, but if you liked that you'd love the movie. Two of my favorite parts are the middle and the ending. You should really see this movie! Another fave movie of mine is Wallace & Gromit The Curse of the Were-Rabbit. But that's another story."
4,Magical and simple,"Corpse Bride is magical and simplistic. Burton has invented another dark and humerous world, filmed with song and dance. The figurines are well made and beautiful. The set design is magnificent, and the story is enjoyable. An awesome group of actors provide their voices in this fun movie."
3,I Now Commit Heresy With This Review,"I am a big fan of Tim Burton's work, especially his other stop motion animation masterpiece, The Nightmare Before Christmas, so naturally I was expecting to fall in love with Corpse Bride, but the fact is it didn't ""grab"" me as much as I thought it would. It even took me two tries to get through it, beautiful though some of it was, as well as grandly atmospheric and visually-appealing, and I think the reason this tale of a living man and his undead would-be bride failed to take hold of me related to its characters, who just didn't seem as interesting as those in The Nightmare Before Christmas. I hope Tim Burton continues to make animated films, in fact I wish he made them more often than he has, but Corpse Bride simply isn't among my favorites."
3,CORPSE BRIDE REVIEW,"PRODUCT ARRIVED WRAPPED AS NEW...HOWEVER, WHEN PLAYED, THE DISC HAS A FLAW...NOT A BIG ONE, BUT IRRITATING FOR A BIT."
5,Excellent!,This movie was perfect and the disk was in great condition. I love this movie so much and it's a great Halloween movie to watch. I was very pleased with the price and quality of this movie.
2,Very disappointing,"I rushed to the video store yesterday to rent this as soon as it came out; I'd been really looking forward to seeing it, but decided to rent it first before buying it. I've been burned in the past. But how bad could it be? It's by Tim Burton, the guy who brought us ""Nightmare Before Christmas"" and the original Batman movie.I'm very glad I did.This movie comes nowhere near the genius of Nightmare; it's a tepid and insipid story that lacks energy, set to a totally forgettable score by Danny Elfman (another huge disappointment of this movie).The only memorable character in this piece is the Corpse Bride herself. The rest of the characters, especially Victor (voiced by Johnny Depp) are yawn-inspiring.Where's Jack Skellington when you need him?"
4,The Corpse Bride,Don't let the title of this movie turn you away. It's a wonderful movie for kids! They won't want to miss a second of it.
4,Music for your beautiful soul,"I listen to this CD every other day cause it be so soulful. It be magical. It be mystical. It be natural music from the Creator. There is no clutter here, just Great Music. Some of it will help send you on your way while other cuts will help you relax and enjoy the moment. This CD should be part of your collection NOW"
5,fice stars all the way from the caribbean- st.lucia,very soothing............beautiful mellow music u can get lost in it..................definitely one for the jazz collection!!! keep it up.charmaine lansiquot
5,The Man'd of GOD!!,"A must have album for anyone who knows or would love to know the ministry of Rev John P Kee. As in Rev Kee's 'Color Blind' album, this is the 'Man'd of GOD' on his own, belting out soulful, imploring songs on the love, grace and mercy of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. And in a way that only John P Kee can! If you want to be encouraged and reminded of the 90's, you want to own this CD..."
3,It works,"This is made up from solid pieces of treated lumber. They were sufficiently dry. My hands did not get wet handling it. I would feel more comfortable if it were about 6"" longer. As it is, I can only hope that it doesn't tip if it gets hit. Also, I am disappointed that it came with no hardware or instructions or warnings."
3,"Comfortable, but....","I LOVE how these work with my high arches. They are comfortable shoes. However, this is only the second season I've worn them, and both shoes have multiple cracks in the soles. Deep cracks that go all the way through and across. I'm sorry, but for the cost of these shoes, they can do better than that. I wouldn't recommend buying them to anyone, in spite of their comfort, simply because the cost isn't worth it for the quality. I don't beat my shoes up and I can't find anything I might have done that was too hard on them."
1,Seller sent wrong item,"I bought this for my wife. I ordered brown, and I received old brown.She is a surgeon and needed to replace the previous right away. Because she needed the clogs NOW, and she couldn't afford to wait another week for a replacement, she will be stuck with the wrong pair for a while."
2,Cute shoe!! Way too heavy!!,"I work in a pharmacy and I am on my feet up to 12 hours a day. I had heard so much about how great Dansko shoes are. I got this pair and I was so excited because they are a very nice looking shoe. I wore them 1 day and decided that there was just no way I could keep them. They are way to heavy. I was trying to find a shoe that would help reduce the swelling in my ankle an old injury I still have trouble with). My feet were aching and my BOTH ankles were very swollen. Maybe it was just this style? I have spoken with many nurses that love Dansko and wouldn't put on any other kind. But for me, I'm going to have to go back to the Born Toby. Sorry....I really wanted thee to work out."
4,Utilitarian,Extremely comfortable shoes for when you have to be on your feet all day. They are not very fashionable though. I look terrible wearing them all the time because they are so much more comfortable then any of my cute shoes.
3,Look great but not so comfy,"These shoes look super professional but are not as comfortable as they should be for the price I paid. The shoe size I ordered is correct but they hurt the tops of my feet, where the bone is. I am a little disappointed but I am hoping that the more I wear them that they will possible get ""broken in"" and not hurt like they do now."
3,Not good if you have a bunion,"I purchased the Emerald Dansko Women's Professional Box leather clog because of its good looks and Dansko's good reputation with the hospital crowd.Unfortunately, I have a small bunion and the clog was torture to wear on the troublesome foot.Bottomline, beware of this clog if you have a bunion!"
4,Go to a store and try them on!,"I had heard from so many people that these were the most comfortable shoes ever, so I had to try them. I was going to order them from amazon and was a little intimidated by the size options. I went to a store to try them on and I am glad I did! The fit is very different and I definitly needed the help of a sales person. I ended up with a whole size bigger than I thought I was. They are very comfortable and I am happy with them so far, but am glad I didn't order online because I would have had to exchange for a bigger size."
5,My feet are in Heaven,"I've been teaching in Dansko Professional clogs for eight years. I have no more neck or back pain. If my feet could smile, they would! I highly recommend these shoes!"
3,seniors,"I got this dvd for my parents, after purching Young at Heart previously. I was somewhat disappointed, but I guess I was comparing it to the Young at Heart dvd. Young at heart was uplifting in every way, and Sunset story although good was not up to par with the dvd. I purchased this divd on customer reviews, that had glowing things to say. Maybe they had not seen the Young at Heart dvd."
5,Very overwhelming experience,"This documentary really made me re-think what it means to grow old. I'd guess before this I didnt think about it all that much and I would write older folks off no matter what thier opinion was because they were just old and senile, but I can see how wrong I may have been sometimes.These two ladies in this movie crack me up, and theyr so honest and caring. Their friendship is one tht I wish I could have.Really, if yer looking for a feel good movie or a movie that will just make you re-think what the future has in store for you then I'd pick this up. Would make a great gift for anyone who is taking care of an elderly parent or grandparent as well. Charming movie."
4,overall a good book,"This is one of my favorite movies, so I figured I would give the book a try. Matheson caught my interest with ""somewhere in time"" and I am currently reading all his books now. This is very different than the movie. Overall, I would say that in some ways it is better than the movie, in others it is worse. Overall, it is a great storyline. And it is a good book. Definitely worth buying. It is a small book though, be forewarned. You can easily read it in a day."
2,For The First Time...,"The author had a great idea writing this book. I just wonder if he understands what the word redundant means? Can he be more imaginative rather than repeatedly saying; ""he said.."" then ""he said..."" and again ""... he said.""? For the very first time I can actually say I thought the movie was better and did this book much justice!"
3,Spooky and Hypnotically Scary.,"Richard Matheson's Stir Of Echoes is a good little suspense novel. I really enjoy Matheson's writing in the first person. He does it so well, you feel like the character.The novel had me right from the start. Spooky, and frightening, I don't think I ever want to get hyptonized, ever.I really enjoyed this novel, but would have liked it more if there were a few more characters that the main character could sense. I really sympathized with the main character's family, but never really liked anyone else in the novel.The ending is pretty good, but I felt like the suspense ran out of gas a little more that midway through. It became a whodunit adventure shortly afterwards."
2,Book betrayed by movie,"Let me make one thing clear right now...I'm not rating this book in relation to the movie. I think this is a two star book on its own demerits. The book felt very long as I was reading it. Most of the characters are just ""there."" Sure, things go on with them, but if any one subplot was missing, it would not affect the outcome of the book at all. Also, the end of the book let me down very much. It felt like he reached his limit of pages and just drew it to a close as quickly as he could. The rest of the story was so drawn out and protracted, then in the span of a few pages it's resolved. It's hardly proper payoff for reading through the preceeding 200 pages. This is one of few instances where a movie was better than a book."
2,A Stir of Outdated-ness,"I was excited to read from this author, who many popular Sci Fi and Fantasy writers today give homage to. That excitement quickly turned to dissapointment. The writing is choppy and very out-dated. The plot was not very compelling. In fact I would never have finished this very thin book if I hadn't heard such adulation of it from authors whom I love. I'm guessing now that when these authors were younger, very young perhaps, they enjoyed the basic intrigues and imagination in this book. If they were to have read it for the first time as an adult,now, I find it hard to believe that they would have the same sentiments. It may have been ahead of its time, but how can that be considering Tolkien was before it. I am reluctant to read any of Matheson's other works because this was so unintriguing. It was a fairly interesting yarn at best. I may still give I am Legend a shot, if it's in the bargain bin."
4,"Very romantic, somewhat wordy","This book lives up to its reputation as a very romantic tale of unrequited love. Although it is quite wordy, one should take the time and make the effort of concentration to read it slowly and savour the images that the words conjure up. Without having read this book in its original language, I think that it may lose a bit in translation."
2,so hard to get through,"I have always wanted to read this book, and when I finally had the chance, I was really disappointed. The story itself--the idea of the story--was really romantic and wonderful. Getting from the start to the end was the problem--it just dragged. It was truly difficult to get through it and I just didn't love it at all. It ended up being a tough read for me--I finished it only because I wanted to know how it would end, not because I was enjoying it. In the end, I sighed with relief that I was finally finished."
5,Love this book!!,"I was a little hesitant about starting LITTOC because I'd never read Gabriel García Márquez before. I didn't know what to expect when started reading, but I was pleasantly surprised by his quirky characters. What reeled me in from the beginning is the fact that it's not your normal everyday love story."
2,Not my cup of tea...,"I purchased this book as my monthly book club read...I never finished it. I've heard so many great things about the book, perhaps I'll try reading it again at a later date."
3,"Sublime prose, weak story... (2 1/2 stars)","The driving force of this book is certainly the extraordinary facility with which Marquez writes - congratulations are also due to Edith Grossman who translated this book into english. Marquez's words almost sound like poetry easing the reader in this otherwise contrived story. One cannot neglect the weakness of the novel's plot. It is hard to understand what drives the main protagonist - Florentino Ariza. In this ageless quest for love, Ariza does not manage to endear the reader by showing fundamental weaknesses in his demeanor which could be characterized as idiocy, pedophilia, promiscuity, stubbornness...This book was a big disappointement after having read 'A hundred years of solitude', which ought to be considered Marquez's true masterpiece."
4,Thoughts on GGM's Love in the Time of Cholera,"This book conveys a passion that is unique because of its protagonist's[Florentino Ariza] patience and restraint. These great qualities are also consistant with the author's style and rhythm, making the book, oh, just breathtaking."
2,Slow in the Time of Cholera,"I got this book to read as it was the choice of my 'book club', I would not have chosen to buy this, based on the fact I read another one of his books,'A Hundred days of Solitude' and found it to be equally slow and boring.I found it hard to get into and didn't feel I was able to get completely absorbed in this book.Each sentence is bursting with so many adjectives that sometimes you forget what is going on in the story.I think it comes down to personal choice of writing style.Not sure that I'll bother to finish this book, it's become more of a mission than a pleasure."
1,No one in my book club finished this book,"We choose this book for book club over a year ago. No one finished it. I got the further than anyone as a read 1/2 of it. Now that I have read the other one star reviews I am glad I didn't waste more of my time. Why am I writing this review - to up the one star reviews and to let more people know that many people did NOT like this book. I have never ever not finished a book club book. I don't really remember much about it other than it was very descriptive to the point of verbose. I did not connect with main characters emotion. How do you fall in love with someone on sight? I just didn't get it. I had one friend suggest that the book, first written in Portuguese, perhaps didn't translate well"
2,Love in the Time of Cholera,"I am very disappointed in the story. At first I thought it was a wonderful love story until it went on and on and depressingly on for 250 pages...and what in the world did he, Florentino, (all I can picture is a 'nebish' who had 622 affairs?) see in Fermina, a nasty, angry woman?"
5,Marquez soars....,"with a beautiful tale of love in South America at the turn of the century. All three of its main characters are succinctly drawn, and the reader can feel the process of aging and the changing of feelings and expectations as we proceed through the seasons of life. Minor characters that surround the love triangle are colorful and woven with great care into the story. Marquez must have known great loves and sustaining loves in his life to have captured all of its flavors here. With a truly satisfying ending, and historical reality threaded throughout the human experience, this is a great book of the 20th century. Read it as soon as you can; it is a treasure."
4,Great read!,"I ordered for a second hand book but it arrived in a good condition, though slightly old as expected. One of the most romantic novels ever written. Great style of writing and keeps you hooked till the very end. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who keeps interest in classic literature."
2,Oy Vey!!!,"I am a fast and often reader, but I have been on this book for 3 weeks, maybe a month. So wordsy, and the paragraphs are sooooooo long. Story is over told and very over sold. I am trying to finish only for one reason and that is because the movie is due out this week, and I want to see it. I am sure the book is written beautifully, but it is not user friendly. I am often having to remind myself who is who, and try to get through the long long paragraphs. I hope the ending makes all of this worthwhile, but after re-reading the comments, I think perhaps it won't. I for sure will not be reading Oprah's next book, I am beginning not to trust her recommendations."
1,A very disappointing ending,"I heard a lot of rave reviews about this author with regards to ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE, so I thought I'd try out this book first since I heard ONE HUNDRED YEARS took a lot of concentration.The author was very good at describing the scenery of the locations of the book, but I thought the book itself was not about love but more of one man's infatuation of a woman that he couldn't have. His multiple conquests of other women as a sign of devotion to his unattainable Fermina Daza was a ridiculous concept (but I guess people cope in different ways) and the ending was not how I expected. I found Florentino Ariza's character deeply disturbing and not someone that could be loved, regardless of time and distance.I managed to struggle through the book and was disappointed in its outcome and its bizarreness. I almost put it down for good (such as I did for Ayn Rand's THE FOUNTAINHEAD), but I pressed on anyway. I'm glad that I was able to finish it, but that's about it."
3,Pretty but shallow and circular,"I wanted to love this book. Marquez's style is charmingly poetic and melodramatic. I love reading his graceful, quirkily-descriptive language. But a couple hundred pages in and I realized that the characters never grow, and what's worse, I didn't care about them. Finally, at page 271 the main character's affair with a fourteen-year-old girl was presented as normal, and I put the book down in protest."
2,Creepy Love,"While this book was a study of love, the sexual obsessions of the main character frequently were perverse if not all right criminal. The plot plods along and ends with a whimper. I would have rated it even but some the prose was enchanting."
3,Was it really a love story?,"While there is no doubt that Gabriel Garcia Marquez is an excellent writer, I can't help but think that this is a story more about one man's obsession than love. I can't blame Fermina Daza for rejecting Florentino, the man was bizarre. And was he really in love or obsessed by her? His actions reminded me of a stalker. I wanted to reach through the book and shake him and say, will you leave the poor women alone and get a life already!! I found Florentino's affair with his young godchild disturbing. A 70 year old man and a 14 year old girl??? How is that love?Then he brushes aside her death with an oh well. Sorry, just couldn't buy it. The ending was forced too, it seemed as though Fermina just gave up and gave in. Florentino made my skin crawl, he was more predator than lover. I was glad to finish the book."
4,"Many characters, great reading","I found this book hard to get into and decided that I needed to read it slower, because of the many characters. I am over half way through it and love it. It almost feels as if its a good friend when I pick up the book to read it."
1,"Dry, boring trash","This novel, unlike captivating stories, was hard to pick up rather than put down. While reading it, I felt like I had returned to eighth grade where reading was an assignment. It was incredibly hard to trudge through the seemingly endless and uneventful first chapter. Perhaps, had the story been told first person rather than third, it could have been better. But I doubt it."
1,Let's ramble - shall we?,"I'm not sure what I expected, but I vaguely remember James Frey, author of ""A Million Little Pieces"" saying this was one of his top five reads; I couldn't believe it! I must confess that my mother and I (she's a young 83, I'm 48) have created our own little ""Book Club"" that is bi-coastal - it gives us one more thing to talk about when we chat on the phone. At least she finished it; disappointed! Every time I picked it up it seemed to wander aimlesslesly from one subject to the other, without much regard to the pace. I felt I was constantly on siesta! From now on we're sticking to the classics - this felt utterly pointless."
2,I don't get why everyone loves this book. I could not get into it at all!,"I'm a big fan of all kinds of fiction, but especially historical fiction. I love classics too. I didn't like this book at all. It seemed almost to copy the style of classics from earlier times, only without any substance. I even noticed that it used some very obscure words from the English language that were used in ""Great Expectations."" Seemed like the author was stretching to sound classic."
3,Manufacturer should improve this toy.,This game has the bones of a fun and entertaining toy. I am sorry to say it does not deliver. My son received this game on Christmas and the day after I was ready to throw it out. It continuously comes apart and should be redesigned.
4,No automatic shut-off,"Works good, good price. Chose this one because it doesn't have an automatic shut-off"
1,Awful.,"This is a poor excuse for a novel. The twins are misrepresented, Raistlin's level of power (for the time period) is incorrect, and Earwig Lockpicker is the most poorly realized kender that I have ever read. The book is basically a Sherlock Holmes story with a lot of pointless asides, and the authors are incorrect in their assumption that Raistlin is an appropriate character to cast in this role."
5,How this album touched me?,"This album really touched my heart! I was traveling last year for the Thanksgiving Holidays. For some reason, my spirit wouldn't let me leave home without this CD! So I had to be obedience to the Spirit. From the moment I put this CD in, God dropped His anointing on me! Thank you Jesus! I was touched tremendously! I was really blessed by this anointed man of God and his choir! I thank God that you were a available vessel, for Him to use! Be bless and I pray your strength in the Lord!"
4,hilarious and morally challenging,"An almost transgressive foray into traditional Taiwanese family culture. Unpredictable to the last minute, the film is ironical of traditional views over homosexuality but also raises important moral issues concerning family as an institution and abortion. In the end, can the older generation with its deep rooted conservatism and the younger one, with open mind and (they think) no taboos live together? This film will make you think about all this and make you laugh, a lot, as you do so!"
5,FUNNY AND CRAZY MAN,"I mean this movie will have you cracking up from the beginning to the end. Although there were some tend moments, the actors played out their roles so well and nice that you wont want to turn away from the TV set. Highly recommended"
4,quirky and well-directed.....,"I must say that it was quite intriguing to watch this film, directed by Ang Lee, after watching another one of his earlier films that he was well-known for [EAT DRINK MAN WOMAN]. This ""comedy of errors"" storyline is as chaotic as it is engaging. A Taiwanese-American man (Winston Chao) involved in a long term relationship with his White gay lover (Dion Birney) must pretend to be straight when his parents come to town. What's more, they want to find him a good Taiwanese wife. Though, he makes it clear that his standards are impossibly high, his parents find the woman who matches ALL of his qualifications. Thus, the plot thickens. I won't ruin it for you. I will say that it is, both, a comedy of errors and a human drama of bombastic proportions. The themes include those of loyalty, bicultural identity and familial duty. As usual, Ang Lee is in fine form with this one."
5,Excellent autobiography. Touching.,"I loved this book. What attracted me to it in the beginning was the title. I was curious to what it meant.Although I saw the treatment of Adeline, and her siblings, as horrendous, I could see, through the way she wrote, why they continued to stay loyal to their parents. Striving for acceptance causes people to do unusual, in the eyes of others, things.Brava Adeline Yen Mah for telling your story. I loved the used of the Chinese sayings. It added to the authencity of the autobiography."
3,Strong themes,"This was a heartbreaking story of how one girl was treated growing up. It was harder for me to continue felling sorry for her after she left home. She seemed too fixated on getting her parent's love. She just kept going back for more rejection. Also, the main story is interspersed with bits of history, which made it slightly confusing."
4,Couldn't put it down,"This was a very interesting story about growing up in China in the early part of the 20th century with an abusive stepmother. Even though Adeline suffered much at the hands of her stepmother, she still went on to lead a good, and prosperous life. I read this book in just a few days. I just had to know how this brave little girl's story turned out."
1,Not Impressed,"This woman portrayed herself as a saint! I found myself rolling my eyes all through this book. Because of her complaining, whining and overall illusion of grandeur, I had no empathy for her at all. I felt I wasted my money buying this book."
1,not worth reading,"The initial chapters of the author's family history and childhood are compelling, but the book ends up dwelling in more detail that I care to know about the petty details of her adult family conflicts. The author is always right, with the purest of motives, etc. and I find her views highly suspect in the end. There is no real edification or inspiration at the conclusion of this tale. Merely the airing of a wealthy family's dirty linen."
3,Depressing,"Truly a story of beating the odds. Very little happiness in this book,which unfortunately was the true story. If you have a terrible family this may make you feel better."
3,moving yet uninteresting.,"Adeline Yen Mah's childhood story is moving. It is impossible to read her tale of abuse and terror without reflecting on the tenacity with which children hold on to their optimism. However, after the first hundred pages or so, though, my thoughts were along the lines of ""All right, already! You were the poor abused martyr of the family; tell me something new!"" In the future, when I decide to read books relating to Chinese family values and culture, I plan on sticking with Amy Tan's novels."
5,an incredable story which gets to the heart of life and love,"It is a well written story, I was unable to put the book down. Adeline Yen Mah writes from the heart and places her own personal stuggles in relationship to the history of China. I am amazed at how strong a child""s need is for parental acceptance and love. I also received an small understanding of the Chinese culture and how they view family and work. This book is well worth reading! It is one of the best I have read."
3,It was interesting but parts of it did not ring true.,"At first, it was interesting and unbelievable....after awhile I began to question if the whole story could be true. It seemed inconsistent and she returned to her family again and again for continued abuse of one kind or another. Also, her family gave her so many mixed messages or else she failed to comprhend what was really being said to her by her sister, brothers and step mother. While I could understand her need to be loved and wanted, she achieved that with her husband and children. Her step sister, Susan appeared to be far more well adjusted and came to accept her parents and siblings for what they were. Adeline, however, went back again and again and expected acceptance. I don't beleive her parents and siblings could have constantly changed in their treatment of her... As I said, after awhile I felt there was another side or sides to this story. What does anyone else think?"
2,Author's overexposure undercuts the emotional impact,"After reading this and seeing how many other books Dr. Yen Mah has written which have some variation on ""Chinese Daughter"" stuck in the title like a Nike Swoosh, I wonder if this is how she introduces herself to new people. ""Hi, I'm Adeline the abused Chinese kid, how are you?"" The obvious attempt to capitalize on tragedy at the expense of family members put a bad taste in my mouth from the start. Yes, it was a horrible childhood, but I've heard of worse, and the self-pity is only barely restrained in the prose.However, it isn't *badly* written, and provides a good layman's view of Chinese child-rearing, culture, and, in small doses, a half-decent historical context."
1,"Lame, contrived, empty","I was SO disappointed by this book. I found it to be completely void of any context and reflection. Had I not been reading it with a book club (none of whom liked it either), I would have stopped after the first couple of chapters. I am surprised that she rarely reflected on her mother's death as a huge turning point in her life. Then in just three pages we learn that she gets married, has sex for the first time, and gives birth to her first child, and she and her son are physically abused. These very important facts are told in a flippant way with no perspective. I also don't understand why she didn't help out her Aunt Baba more. I came away not caring about her or her family. Sure her life was hard, but as a piece of literature, this book was weak."
4,There's nothing like family to mess up your life.,"This is the biography of Adeline Yen Mah. From an unpromising beginning in life - it only got worse! For most of her life she was abanonded by her father or ignored as the most hated of his second wife's stepchildren.Adeline could never understand this. No explainations were offered and all she wanted was to please her parents and live up to chinese family expectations. All she got was grief and abanonment for her efforts.That Adeline triumphed over this is a minor miracle. However, it wasn't all good news and right to the end of the book, with a few exceptions, like her younger sister Susan, I was very glad that none of her relatives were mine!Malice may gain you money and material wealth as this book shows but it also makes you poverty striken in other ways. It also pays not to be played the fool by these sort of people.This is another sorry story from China -but from a 'wealthy' familiy - but in money only."
5,enjoyed this book,"Very well written, Lots of history is wove into this story. Such a sad upbring for a young girl, but who overlookedthe saddness and became a very successful woman."
3,Interesting,"This book gives you a lot of historical background information on China. The dates of events are all over the map so you have to keep flipping back to review what year is being discussed. It is a very factual, pity me story....when in reality she was really spoiled. She is no Cinderella, she put herself into the positions she was in and her step mother repeatedly taught her independence, strength and how to think for herself. Just because her father had money doesn't entitle her."
4,Knowledge can make a difference!,"The story is not only the unhappy life of Adeline - an unwanted daughter but also a brief development of mainland China and Hong Kong during the past decades. That enables me to grasp a basic impression of the life of chinese, the business style of Shanghai merchants, etc. easily. The best luck in her life is that her fatehr allowed her to continue her study abroad afterwards when she won an important writting competition at the age around 14. With the medical qulification, Adeline could get rid of her wicky family by choosing a new life in America, a place without her family control. From an unwanted daugther to an independant professional, Mah's experience does indicate that knowledge does make a difference as it enriches your life chance to make you become the real master of your own life."
5,Super Produce,My 11-year old daughter loves this kit. She loved it so much last year when she got it for Christmas that I ordered it again! She makes cards for everyone!
2,It was a good start ...,"The beginning of this book was fantastic. I loved the characters and the storyline. I was lost in the new world that had been created for me.Unfortunately, it didn't last. The next thing I knew I was reading about some ""alien"" race invading my medieval world. The book kept going on and on about things I found utterly boring. I lost interest in the characters, and I found my reading times to be toilsome, not pleasurable."
5,As good as the first time,After reading this book I remember why I love reading Raymond Feist so much. His detail and the speed at which the story takes place just embody emotive responses. Bloody awesome...
5,Great book for dealing with performance.,"This book did a really good job in explaining the concepts of performance. It had good specific examples, but also showed how to deal with performance in general. The chapters on performance tools and how to benchmark code were particularly helpful."
1,Dangerous!,"Although there are 3 heat selections, low and medium and no different than high and high is too too hot. I could see serious injury to anyone who falls asleep on this. I do not recommend this product. I have only used this product dry. I do not now if it would be any better moist."
5,A must have reference,This book explains how to solve a plethora of computer annoyances. Steve Bass uses much appreciated humour to assist us in our quest for the perfect computer experience.His explanations are easy to understand as he walks us through a STEP-by-STEP process. He does not re-invent the wheel and is able to refer us to the appropriate url for answer to our annoyances.
2,packed wrong,This was my second purchase of these meal bars - I love them and they are very good. But this time I ordered a lot to hold me for a while. But the seller did not pack them right. I ordered 6 boxes of 12 each but instead of getting that I received on 1 box with 4 in it. The rest were loose in a box. Because of this and the fact that it is summer they were melted and all smashed. I wrote to the seller on 8/10 to complain about the packing but they never answered me. Next time I will find another seller.
3,Not bad,"This set is well made but, unavoidably, cumbersome to use. One must remove a ring on the camera, mount the adapter tube, and then the accessory (even if only a filter) to make use of any of the accessories."
3,What Mrs. fisher knows about Old Southern Cooking,The recipes are cleverly presented but they consist of brief summaries or notes about cooking.
5,A must read,"I read this book the night before my sister's first visit to her oncologist for treatment of lymphoma. Then I gave it to her.It helps to make the incomprehensible a little easier to understand. The day of my sister's last radiation visit, she gave it to a mother of a 16-year-old brain cancer patient. She urged her to pass it on when she was finished with it.I recently bought another copy of Chemo and Radiation for Dummies through Amazon for a friend whose daughter has ovarian cancer. She and her family were so appreciative."
2,"Hello, my name is Braggart....","Sheri Lynch's book is more a display of her achievements with a baby in tow rather than a humorous look at motherhood. I kept waiting for the funny, humorous one liners or stories to make me giggle, but instead found myself bored by Lynch's ""look at me and what I have achieved"" dribble."
2,Too dysfunctional,"We're all a little dysfunctional and hope to not screw it up, but this book put so much emphasis on Mom's dysfunctionality that it became not relevant to us ""normally screwed up"" Moms. I was hoping for humor and good tips, this was not the book."
5,Buy it damn it! Buy it!!!! Or I will!,"Buy it!! It's simple, really really simple, buy it! If you have never seen the movie, don't worry, just buy it. You'll love it, I guarantee it, or you love nothing. At least go to some video store and rent it, then buy it. And if you're not gonna buy it, then send me your money and I'll buy it for you and keep it for myself! If you see or hear anyone with a negative of this movie, it's really simple, they're wrong!!! WRONG! WRONG! WRONGGG!!!!"
4,Surf Ninjas,I really enjoyed this movie. It brought back some good memorie of my childhood. The movie got here in a timely manner.
5,comfortable; good arch support; elegant,best pair of boots I have in my closet; very comfortable; easy to walk in and elegently designed. I bought the black leather ones
1,Warning!,"""Fake reviews from the makers of this film!"" They had hot chick's but everything else was the exact opposite of their reviews.""CHECK THE REVIEWERS OTHER REVIEWS!"" That's right folks the ones that gave it five stars only reviewed this movie. Kinda odd isn't it!? They wouldn't try to pawn this cr*p on to you would they?"
4,"Works Fine, but Seems Expensive","Our office manager recently bought about 25 of these, and they've really come in handy. It's your basic fan, sure, but it has more than enough power to cool off a medium-sized office, it's light, has three speeds, looks well-constructed with reasonably durable compoments, and...it's not ugly.The first and second speeds are usually enough; in fact, I;ve never put it to the max. That's good, because when I tested it at level 3, the fan sometimes rattled (The noise would probably not be as loud on a non-carpeted surface.) I've had it going all day without any problems: It's powerful enough, it doesn't tip, the oscillator works without a hitch, and it's sufficiently quiet below level 3. Features include...almost nothing. Like most fans, there's a metal guard, and it comes with a safety-mided 3-pronged plug. My only complaint is the price, it was about 50% more expensive than I thought it would cost. Maybe it's just a case of blade inflation."
2,Too bad the author forgot she needed a plot to tie together all these rich characters,"Sara Gran's sophomore novel is billed as Chandleresque detective noir. She certainly has the setting correct--flophouses and the streets of 1950's New York. She employs a cast of addicts, pick pockets, hookers, up-and-coming actresses, and pimps in her detective story. Unfortunately, the novel completely lacks a plot or plausible mystery. It's centered around reformed heroin addict named Josephine (""Joe"") who is employed by a missing girl's parents to track her through the underbelly of the city.The novel consists entirely of Joe traipsing through the city, talking tough and being in the know. Towards the end, Gran throws in a series of ""twists"" that serve more as monkey wrenches in a plodding story that as compelling plot devices.If you want noir, stick to the tried and true classics. Gran's novel is barely mediocre, and certainly not worthy of comparison to any of the great detective authors."
3,Mislabeled songs,"I was looking for a nice, relaxing album to fall asleep by, and for that purpose this album might not be bad. But, just listening to the sample tracks, there are at least two tracks which are incorrectly labeled! I am a classical piano player and have personally played and have the music for the songs in question: the one labeled ""Pathetique Sonata: Adagio"", while it is indeed an Adagio by Beethoven, is the second movement from the Moonlight Sonata, not the Sonata Pathetique. And the one labeled ""Song Without Words"", while it is indeed by Mendelssohn, should correctly be titled ""Venetian Boat Song""! (The ""Song Without Words"" is a melody by Tchaikovsky!)Maybe I'm a stickler for detail, but it just seems to cheapen the quality of the album unnecessarily; and would be especially misleading for those who are new to classical music and unfamiliar with the correct songs and artists."
1,hate it,No Counting allowed with poor picture and quality. do not waste your money on this item or on any of there other videos.
3,Many of the reviews predate (by years) the printing date of this edition,"so I'd like to ask the others if their older copy (mine is 2001) is missing any information? My copies are missing part of Hebrews, all of James, 1&2 Peter, 1-3 John, Jude and the beginning of Revelation. Matthew, and Mark however appear twice !!! Is this edition complete? If so I might be sorely tempted to purchase a copy because I greatly enjoy the copy I own even if it's not complete and that's why I rated it 3/5.If this ""review"" violates TOS please delete it."
5,Lovely color and texture,"Chose the products because of reviews here which gave it 5stars. Agree that it's worth it as it has a lovely texture, spread well and is good if you need to be quick in the morning getting out of the house."
3,Good survey of recent scholarship,"This collection of readings brings together fifteen ""benchmark"" essays -- those that have been formative in recent Tudor scholarship -- by a number of key authors in the field. The three sections consider the nature of monarchy in the Renaissance, the role of personality in royal politics, and the exercise of power outside the immediate court. Of particular interest to us are David Starkey's ""Representation through Intimacy: A Study in the Symbolism of Monarchy. . . ,"" Steven Gunn's ""The Courtiers of Henry VII,"" Simon Adams's ""Favourites and Factions at the Elizabeth Court,"" and Margaret Condon's ""Ruling Elites in the Reign of Henry VII."" The style varies from merely academic to densely so, but they should accessible to upper-division students."
1,Extremely Fragile,"The first time I purchased this item one of the air tubes was cracked and the bunny would not pop up. An exchange was made, however, the second time proved just as disappointing. My son loved it at first, as did I. But it took less than 2 weeks for a 4-month-old to break another air tube. I only give this item 1 star because my son loved to kick and make the animals hop into view (when it was working). However, after the second item broke, his frustration with trying to kick the bunny into view again made him kick so hard that, like others, the entire thing would shift. Great concept, but it seems cheaply made and impossible to fix. Not recommended."
5,Fantastic Book,I loved this book so much I ran out to buy all of the books in the series and couldn't put them down. From the very beginning the author takes you on an adventure. All of the books in the series are full of action and adventure with never a dull moment. I highly recommend this series.
4,Admittedly Sappy...,"But still a very entertaining read, as seems to be the standard of any Terry Brooks novel.Continuing his tradition of taking the blandest of plots and making it one of the most interesting books you'll ever read, he uses the idea of a 20th-century lawyer escaping into a world of run-of-the-mill, fairy tale fantasy, and keeps the reader turning the pages the whole way through. In my case, after reading his Shannara novels, I didn't expect any amazing emotional insights to be granted to me in the course of the reading, or the deepest of characters or the most ingenious conflicts or a world in which I could see myself making a decent living. There are plenty of books and series that I could (and have) read if I were looking for something of that caliber. Brooks writes solely to entertain, and he succeeded with this book."
2,Brooklyn Bridge for Sale-- SOLD!,"""Magic Kingdom for Sale"" has a funny premise. Ben Holiday,a lawyer,finds himself winning ownership of a magic country. Real life is melded with fantasy. The fantastical idea works as an idea--not so much in practice. Terry Brooks makes a potentially fun story incredibly dull. There's every fantasy cliche one can imagine-a quest against an evil demon,a beautiful lass,talking animals. Landover is the Generic Fantasyland.CS Lewis knew how to meld the mundane with the fantasy in Narnia,interweaving the Pevensies' days in WWII England with his allegorical kingdom. On the other hand, Brooks can't. It's a dull,boring book. It's a journey over the rainbow not worth taking."
4,Fun and simple. That's a compliment.,"This book is fun and simple, just the way I like my fantasy novels. It was weird, at first, seeing a then-contemporary character (a lawyer, no less) as our hero, but then he's transported to a magical world called Landover, and that's when things get interesting. The book is a perfect length, not overly written like some novels (The Wheel of Time series, for example), and I look forward to reading the other books in this cute series."
3,Brooks greatest work EVER!,"Terry Brooks has never put a better pen to paper than the tale he tells here in the first Landover novel. The fact that the writing is nearly complete and utter rubbish doesn't say much for the rest of his work......on the good side, it's not nearly as derivative and theft-riddled as his Shannara books, earning it a whole two stars more stars than it deserved. Way to go Terry, at least you came up with an idea that was (partially) your *own*.(as if the ""normal guy enters a fantasy world"" thing hasn't been done to death as well)"
5,This is one of Terry borooks' greatest works,M.K.F.S.S. os one of the few books of 300 pages I couldn't put down and finsh under a few hours. It has everything that a Fantasy lover could want
2,Mediocre at best,"I had heard Terry Brooks was an excellent writer. I did not find that to be the case with this book. The story itself was somewhat interesting; the writing, however, was sorely lacking. Brooks used the same predictable vocabulary throughout. He seems to have a particular fondness for the word ""trailer,"" which made me want to spork my eyes out."
5,Great book!,"this was a very good book, i read over easter vacation and couldn't put it down. the ending was kinda weird, but overall a wonderful book! it's a must read 4 fantasy readers!"
2,Not enough,If you like Pamela Anderson you'll like it. But it just doesn't bring out the best in her.
1,dreadful pseudo-science,"DON'T BUY THIS BOOK. I was looking for research purposes into the psychology of environmental issues. This WAS NOT it. there is almost no psychology in it and very little science, the subject seems to have been hijacked by a bunch of flakey new agers. DO believe the others who rated this a 1. There is a good book out there on the psychology of environmental issues, this is not it. This book has no practical applications, it will waste your valuable time and show you nothing at all. If you find a copy of this book: DESTROY."
3,psychology wakeup call,"This book contains essays from a variety of sources. It does not tell you what ecopsychology is but tells you why it makes sence.It quotes many psychologists, even Freud, and analises the real issues of today. Excellent material for a college thesus, but no real info on the techniques used/"
1,I'm returning it,"At first, I was mixed about the book. Dr.Nathanson is great on nutrition and breastfeeding, but I really didn't like her parenting philosophy. Her suggestion that holding a child less during the day is a solution to a child's desiring holding at night seemed cold. That was when I started thinking about returning the book.Then, I got to the section about 9-12 month olds, and her suggestion that now would be the time for me to buy a ""leash"" for my child, so that he would get used to it. That was pretty much my limit. I didn't adopt a dog, I gave birth to a child, and I would no sooner leash him than I would feed him kibble.But, at least she's an advocate of breastfeeding."
3,Pass on this one,The instruction book was good for figuring how to set time and answering machine. It is very hard to hear out of the headset/you must get your ear in just the right place and have the volume all the way up. Don't have more than one of these phones on different lines next to eachother because when one hangs up the usually both do. To much frustration for $70-80.
5,Works great,"My brother told me glaziers use this to polish stainless on the job, and I tried it on my refrigerator where the water dispenser left a stain/corrosion? mark where the water drips on the stainless day after day. Nothing else worked but this did. It is a paste and it has something in it to buff the metal not found in a spray, so it is best for removing stains etc rather than everyday polishing."
4,A pleasant read,"Good as an introductory monograph, poor textbook. All the information is present, but it is not well organized for self learning or course development. Nevertheless it is worth reading if you are interested in this field. If you are new to the material, start elsewhere, then come look at this book."
2,Outdated and the Same Ole Rehashed Stuff About Email Marketing...,"Build your email list with opt-ins and blast them with emails. That's the gist of this stupid, waste-of-money book.I am a fan of Joe Vitale but I don't think I'll be purchasing anymore of his books. He's an excellent salesman and great at copywriting but doesn't live up to his promises from his copy.Opposite of Fred Gleeck who's books lack pages, Joe Vitale jams his pages with examples, anecdotes, cutsie stories, etc. that take away from the content of the book.So, where's the happy medium for me? Have a book that has examples related to the text. Don't expand points just to add pages and for no other reason. Cut to the chase but include enough information to make sure it's understood."
4,"A new, insightful look at Great Lakes steelhead flyfishing!","If you are a Great Lakes steelhead junkie, then read this book. It features some excellent fly patterns, description of techniques and tackle, and much more. A great read!"
5,Our country's poor,I read The End of Poverty before Katrina hit. Sachs covered the global aspect but could have devoted more pages to our current problem right here in the United States. Thanks to CNN everyone has had a recent wake up call and thankfully donating generously.This is a very well researched and all encompassing work that should be textbook in our colleges and on every American politicians reading list.
3,slow.,"The book was in fine condition, but it took over a month for them to ship it to me. I needed it for a class and was expecting it in about two weeks like the site said. The other two books I ordered at the same time came two weeks after the order, but this book took twice as long."
2,Not what it advertises,"Some interesting insights, but overall, ending poverty was less the focus of the author as touting deregulation and laissez-faire Capitalism. Oh well, I have to read the enemy's books too, right?"
3,Over rated,"I had been assigned this book to read in my development Economics class. Clearly my teacher has a major crush on Jeffrey Sachs as I did not get as good of a grade as I feel I deserved. My main problem with him is that, for lack of a better word, he's a jerk. The forward by Bono, saying that Jeffrey Sachs should be giving the autographs, as well as the constant ""I'm right, you're wrong"" mentality prove that this guy is a total prima donna. Despite good ideas, nobody important would ever take this guy seriously because he's not open to the ideas of others. He's simply in love with himself. I much prefer the work of Amartya Sen and Bill Easterly, also less known, David Dollar."
3,Good... but it lacks something,"This book was intended to be read by anyone. As a fun, lighthearted read, it's OK. But if you're an economist, like I am, will find this one a bit repetitive and boring, with no real presentation fo solutions to the poverty issues around the world.The part that really caught my attention was Mr. Sachs' work in Russia, Poland, India, China and Bolivia as an economic advisor. Wish he had extended those chapters a bit more, adding more details."
4,The End of Poverty,I thought is was a great book by an author who obviously is a world authority on the subject. I thought he did not give enough emphasis to the problems of investing substantial amounts of money in the underdeveloped world. Even so he convinced me that we should do it for our own long term good if not for humanitarian reasons
1,The End of Humility,"Sachs is pompous and self-important to the point of distraction. It's amazing to have to say that about a book about ending poverty, but it's true. This book is a travelogue of adventures in high-level negotiations, focusing on Sachs' experience advising governments about problems infinitely less complex than the one he wants to address: ending extreme poverty. If you want to feel good about Jeffrey D. Sachs, this is the book for you; if you want a rigorous introduction to the issues, look someplace else."
4,decent book,"This book has an idea that is generally repeated over and over, send more aid to poverty stricken nations. That approach is interesting an cannot be disproved but for that matter it cannot be proven to work. Paul Collier's The Bottom Billion or Guns, Wars, and Votes are a more balanced approach to ending world poverty."
1,A Silly Sell-Out,"Once upon a time I thought Jeff Sachs was both a genius and a tower of integrity....then I read this tragic work. This book is the result of what happens when a brilliant mind goes ""Hollywood"". As a Financial Economist who actually lives in Africa...it is obvious to me that Jeff is selectively clueless about how things really work here. Then again...I think Jeff knows exactly what the people he works for at the UN want to hear."
3,Still unconvinced?,"The End of Poverty is a book of lofty goals, but it is important both for some of the issues it raises and for its position among development theorists of today.**BUT** if you, like myself finished Jeffrey Sachs' book feeling less than satisfied, I recommend you complement his optimism with another book: William Easterly's ""White Man's Burden."" I strongly believe that these books read in conjuction are much more powerful than either read alone. Happy reading!"
2,Frustrated,"I increasingly become frustrated with prescribed economic theories for ending poverty. Poverty will not completely end through economic principles alone. The devaluing of human life based on skin color, social class etc. must be fundamentally understood and revamped simultaneously with any economic plan. With the best intentions economists develop master plans to change situations; however, NO economic plan with erase WORLD POVERTY!!! The problem is inherently so much deeper than economics. While Sachs offers some interesting and practical methods of erasing poverty, this is only a start of scratching the surface of the many economic disparities crippling global communties. The problems must also be explored on a social level and issues related to the devaluing of human life based on creed, color, religion etc., must be explored in depth."
1,Turkey Turkey,After reading the other reviews I was happy to know I wasn't the only that thought this could not have been written by Lilian Braun. I thought I was going crazy!!!!!!!!!!! The wording and places do not seem to be the same as she always uses.The plot was not exciting and she could have developed the new bookstore and other events more and not spent so much time on his historical dramas that I find quite boring.I own all of her books and have read everyone several times. I like some of them better than others but this one is defintely the least favorite.I am certainly glad I bought a used copy and didn't spend a lot of money on it.
1,The Cat Who Needed A Rest,"I doubt that Lilian Jackson Braun is writing these books herself anymore, and I firmly believe that a ghost writer has been penning the Qwill books starting with The Cat Who...Cheese. Qwill, Koko and Yum Yum are the good friends of so many of us loyal readers, and I think others besides myself miss their company in the newer books of the series."
3,Wheres the Mystery????,I enjoy reading all the cat books. Some more than others. The only thing I enjoyed about this book is keeping up with the towns people. I really missed the mystery. Not too much of a challenge for Jim Quilleran and Koko and of course Yum-Yum.I would still buy it because I have them all. Great light reading!
1,Disappointed,"It looks like Ms. Braun has decided to kick back and cash in the the cachet of the early ""Cat Who"" books. This one isn't worth even the very short time it takes to read it. As a long time reader of this series, I'm disappointed - to say the least."
2,Did Ms. Braun use a ghost writer?,The Cat Who Talked Turkey was a big disappointment to me. I had the strange feeling that Ms. Braun didn't author this book at all. After reading most of her The Cat Who .... books I've grown accustomed to her unique style of writing which I have loved. This time her style wasn't as prevalent.
1,This book is clearly GHOSTWRITTEN!,"Having compared this to all of Ms. Braun's previous titles in the series, I can say with utter confidence that this book was ghostwritten. Even ""going downhill,"" she could never have descended to this level of poor writing. The structure, plot, and even word use are horrible. The diction is NOT consistent with any of the previous novels. Dialogue is shoddy and also inconsistent.If you are a Cat Who fan, avoid disappointment, and don't buy this book. Don't even make the mistake of reading it if it's lent to you."
2,Ghost Writer??,"I am not a fan of the mystery genre. However, I became ""hooked"" on this series after reading a couple that my mother had. So, last year I read sequentially the series of ""Cat Who"" books, and read this installment last fall. I was disappointed in this volume. It seemed obvious that someone had taken her notes and wrote this book for her. Perhaps something happened and she was unable to complete it herself. The writing did not have the ""sparkle"" and ""life"" of the previous works. In the previous volumes, the imagery was delightful -- making one able to ""see"" the antics."
1,Not Braun,"This is a terrible book. I've enjoyed ""Cat Who"" books for years, and this book does not read like a Lillian Jackson Braun book. It sounds like it was written by someone who does not have an intimate relationship with the characters. It's generic, generic, generic. Where are the details of the crime? How is Quill involved? It's like reading a Cliffs notes version of the book. Lillian, please don't go down this road - I'd rather have The Cat Who series end than have generic volumes turned out one after another...without the local color and intrigue of the other books."
2,Time to retire this series.....,"Lillian Jackson Braun has given her readers a lot of pleasure in the ""Cat Who..."" series, but it is obvious that she is now writing by rote and no effort at mystery is evident in this latest ho-hum book in the series. This book demonstrates that a very popular formula can pall on even the author eventually. I think she has exhausted the possibilities here - although the residents of Pickax are charming as ever, this is just a compiliation of characteristics with no exposition to anyone who has not read the series previously. It's time to call it a day and for Ms. Braun to rest on her well-deserved laurels."
3,A Turkey's Egg...,"I listened and purchased the unabridged audio version of the Cat Who Talked Turkey, and was quite disappointed. First, the story was far too short. Four cassettes and only four hours of listening? And this is UNABRIDGED?! Second, there was absolutely NO mystery. The supposed 'mystery' was tied up neatly, but was quite implausible. No explanation as for why the villain did what the villain did. Silly.While I enjoyed seeing Mr. Q in action, I did think him a bit meddlesome to advise the old woman to cut the granddaughter out of her will. How many museums does Moose County really need anyway? The novel was well narrated, but it was too short and lacked suspense and mystery. I'd check this one out at the library before purchasing."
3,Amazon customer,"If you are planning on buying this because of the Larousse dictionary - don't, it's a Merriam-Webster dictionary! I bought this from one of the sellers that Amazon uses and they sent me the DBE-1440A. I don't have a problem with it per se or the Merriam-Webster dictionary, but wanted the DBE-1440 specifically because of the Larousse dictionary. I guess my problem is with the way this was advertised on Amazon.com and that the seller said they had this particular one in stock. Otherwise you can buy this at your local stores. Also, I ordered this second day air delivery and did not receive it for a week! As far as the device itself, just as advertised with many ways to help you with your Spanish either for traveling or classes. Nice size too. I give the device itself 4 stars (because it does not have my perferred dictionary), but the advertising/shipping gets 3 stars."
5,An absolute MUST!,"Two years ago, I went to Mexico with very little speaking ability of the language. I spent two weeks with non-English speaking people, and this was my lifeline to effective communication. Regardless of level of your proficiency, this is essential to learning and provides immediate access to expression of ideas in a form everyone can understand. I still have not exhausted the information in terms of phraseology and idiomatic expressions. I think this will always be my ready reference when I don't know the right word and need it quickly."
1,"Disappointed, so far...","So far, this has been a disappointment. Shipped promptly, but the item was not the DBE 1440 with the LaRousse Dictionary, as the ad specified, it's the Merriam-Webster Dictionary.Here's the catch: Item doesn't work. Can't get it to turn on, at all! Hoping to hear back quickly from vendor, as I need this item for a business trip!"
3,"Good, but not great...","I found it useful for the first week, though I found looking up verb conjugations a bit tedious, as one is forced to scroll through every conjugation to reach the desired one. At the end of the first week, the screen of the unit, which I had in my pocket, broke when a moderate amount of pressure was accidently applied to it. It seems to me that the company could spend 2 or 3 cents more in manufacturing costs to make a sturdy cover that will withstand a small amount of pressure without the screen cracking. I mean, like, they don't know that people will put it in their pockets? I hope to get it repaired, but as I am abroad, it is quite difficult. I will think twice before buying any other product from this company."
3,Not heavy duty or really hot,"This pad is somewhat of a disappointment. Yes, it vibrates, and yes, it gets warm, but it doesn't do either function really well. It has a power adapter, 12 volt, I think, and therefore doesn't deliver the power or heat of something that uses the full household current."
3,"It's a bit too ""thick""","It's very nice to have heat & massage in one unit, but it's a bit too thick to get comfortable with when seated. Other than that, I kept it and I'm finding ways to make it work! Seller shipped it very fast to me!"
4,Not Bad At All!,"I dont see how there are soo many complaints. I haev had mine for almsot two months and used the thing 5 days a week all day at my office. (im using it now!) Its very warm and quite comfortable sitting on my back. Have ran over the cord 100 tiems with the chair and still no problems. Only thing I dont like is that it shuts off automatically after only like, ten minutes. But I still recommend it!"
1,Trivial Pursuit 20th Anniversary Edition,Save your money and buy a different game. I have always loved Trivial Pursuit and have many editions but this one is ridiculously hard.
4,I found the game to be entertaining.,"I seem to be in the minority, but I enjoyed playing this game. As did the rest of the people who I played with. The questions weren't ""extremely"" difficult, albeit not easy. I like a good challenge :o)and this game lived up to it."
4,Too Hard? Not!,My 30 something friends and I played last friday and I am going to order my own. Is it hard...yeah...is it easier than the very first...much. Alot of the answers you will know by osmosis...just living in the latter half of the 20th century.
2,Leaves alot to be desired,"I was thrilled to find out that Trivial Pursuit, one of my all-time favorite games, had a new 20th anniversary edition! I wanted this game so bad for Christmas! Our local store ran out of them and I didn't get one...I was heartbroken. But, alas, in late January there it was, sitting on the store shelf beconning to me...I did not have the money at the time, so I quickly put it on layaway. Before I had the chance to get it out of layaway, a friend of mine brought her game over (SHE got one for Christmas) - I was HORRIFIED. The game was stuffy and boring, and the questions were of little or no interest. I am a relatively intelligent person, and I found the questions to be next to impossible to answer. After 5 minutes, it was packed back up in the box and we have yet to get it out again. Needless to say, I am quite glad that I got a glimpse before I spent [$$] on this game. SAVE YOUR MONEY."
1,No bueno,The game is not fun and is to hard for the average mind to come up with the answer. It gets to a point where everybody tries to help one another just to finish the game. Long and boring.
2,"Yeeeeah, no.","The product image seems just a LITTLE different from the name if the item... I mean, sure, it's probably pretty sturdy and well made, but I don't think it's entirely true to the character design from the show... For one thing, the colors seem way off."
4,Boom! Cinnamon!,"Great cologne, very warm, powdery, cinnamon heavy, a touch of copper and tin, a bit of vanilla. Stylish, intimate, but not subtle. It's clean enough that you can get away with wearing it during the day, but it would be too much for the summer sun - stick to wearing at night or during other seasons.Aside from a lack of subtlety my only gripe is that it doesn't come with a cap unless you keep it in the ridiculous plastic globe/stand thing it comes in, so the nozzle gets a bit gummy. Also can't be brought with when traveling."
2,I don't like it,"This frange smells like baby powder with a little touch of cinnamon. I only bought to try it, but definitely don't smells well"
3,Generic,"Yep, even Black and Decker website doesn't pride this item enough to sell it. It's probably some knock-off import with the B&D Brand name. The light is so dim I can't imagine how a bug would be attracted to it. Stinger brand sucks too ... mine lasted only one season before the grid stopped working. I read a couple articles and now I'm not sure bug zappers are the way to go. The article raised a question - why would anyone want to ""attract"" bugs in the first place? Good question. It recommends sticking to tried and proven technology - good old Deet applied to the skin. Even stated that citronelle candles are a waste of money. Live and learn."
4,Not Bad,"A much better read the The Last of the Mohicans, this book is actually presented in understandable language. And while trivial at times, this novel presents a clear and interesting picture of 17th Century colonial life and is an enjoyable read."
4,downtown abby,"This was an excellant buy for me, I enjoyed this show alot. good story line with good actors. good price."
4,Downton Abbey,I totally enjoyed the first season of Downton Abbey. I look forward to watching the next two seasons. I hope they are as entertaining.
5,<3,"This reminds me of Pride and Prejudice (which I love). The first episode might be a bit confusing, but just you wait! It get's so good! I highly recommend it!"
5,Love It,"Downton Abbey is just the best - writing, acting, sets. I'm so glad I was able to go back to the beginning and catch up to present day broadcasts."
2,Disc Quality Very Bad!,"I ordered the import, region free, UK edition blu ray dvd. Very disappointed. The Interior scenes are very grainy. I have the UK edition Season 2, (PBS release) and it is very sharp and clear. I wanted to get the rumored 'unedited' versions for the extended scenes, but I don't think they really exist. I did not find any extra minutes in the versions.If I can, I am going to return this set because the viewing quality is so poor compared to my season two discs.I love the series, the show is impeccable and very entertaining."
2,Not appropriate for family viewing,"Period dramas are a favorite with our family, and I was taking a peek at this to see if I liked it well enough for purchasing. I was drawn in by the wonderful acting and the plot, but then was disturbed by the explicit sexual scenes. Why must they always ruin a good thing with displays of mature adult material, especially when it seems so out of character for a period of drama of this time? One scene shows two men kissing and discussing their love affair, and the other of a man showing up in a woman's bedroom unannounced and without having so much as established a relationship. This is PBS Masterpiece Theater, for crying out loud. There could have been a better way to introduce the scene and the character, without going to such lengths. Thankfully I was able to preview this online without spending any money, but I am sorely disappointed that the director did not find a different way to tell the same story and make it family friendly."
2,well produced but blindside - SPOILER,One problem with unrated videos with incomplete descriptions is that the content can blindside viewers. I enjoy watching Masterpiece with my kids but am rather conservative so I found the unexpected scenes of coerced sex and homosexuality in this series objectionable. But it provided a good teachable moment for discussing how producers and writers try to foist their views of morality on the masses.I also question whether material written less than 10 years ago should be labeled as classic...
5,wonderful show,This a terrific show made even more enjoyable by the ability to view for free with a prime account. Wonderful actors! Great story and I can't wait to view season two.
5,Everything I expected the series to be....,A few sick days with nothing to do and I decided to catch up on this series after hearing so much about it. I'm in love and the sick days have flown by happily. Well into season 2 at this point.
5,DVD,Pleased to be able to get this season 1 of the series. Am excited to watch and continue with the next season also.
5,Masterpiece. : Downton Abbey,"So well done. Nobody does drama or comedy like the British. The characters are like people you meet on the street-not the body-perfect, make-up overdone actors in American movies."
3,"Fantastic show, deceiving delivery date.","I've seen all of Seasons 1 and 2 of Downton Abbey and absolutely love the show, so when I heard a family friend was going through some health issues and might have a bit of down time, I thought it would be the perfect gift.I ordered it on Thursday, June 21st and was told the estimated delivery date was Friday, June 22nd. Assuming I would safely get it at the latest by Saturday, I made plans to visit my friend and bring it to her on Sunday. As of now, in the wee hours of Sunday morning, it hasn't delivered and hasn't even gone out for shipment.At 5:49pm on the 21st (a Thursday), my shipment had supposedly left the seller's facility and was in transit, but apparently it wasn't received by the carrier until 12:19am on the 23rd (Saturday). Seems a little fishy to me...If I had known the shipper was unreliable or something, I would have dished out a couple extra dollars with my Prime membership to get it next-day. Very disappointed."
4,it's good yet not when it's near bedtime.,"I find the characters interesting. The scenery and locations are great. It's a good looking series. Yet, I've watched it before bedtime. I find that it could put me to sleep at times. It could use more action. Maybe, a change in the way the scenes are directed and edited. A faster pace at times would be welcome. Overall a good show."
4,Grew on me,"Wife and I watched the first episode due to the hype about the 3rd season, thought we'd see what all the buzz was about since it was a period drama and it surprised us that a period drama could get this much attention. Characters were intriguing but the story seemed slow and the scene that including the men kissing and making reference to other affairs together made for an all-together bad experience and both wife and I told coworkers and friends we thought so... to which they all replied first episode in not like the rest of the series. We watched episode two and found it quite different and much more humorous and a broader story and wondered why the pilot episode would be so dry and slow and racy. We've now watched all of season one and are mid-season two and enjoy it quite a lot."
2,much ado about nothing,"as a huge period drama fan I have to say I'm disappointed with these series. it's boring, and I don't care for any of the characters. I don't like the whole socialist idea. having lived in the socialist country I really don't see what's the fascination about socialism. the only good thing about the series (in my humble opinion) is beautiful sets and costumes, and a little glimpse at ""upstairs/downstairs"" customs. also I laughed at a nurse making diagnosis on the patient and prescribing medicine. that's not in her scope of practice."
1,Amazon failed to send correct version of dvd,"When I went online to order Downton Abbey, there was nothing to indicate that the version was NOT able to be viewed in the US. As soon as I received the film, I contacted Amazon and was told that the correct version would be sent to me immediately. I have not received the correct version to date and Amazon had told me that they had received the wrong version over a week ago. I was told that the correct version was going to be sent the day I called without Amazon awaiting the return of the British version of the film. so I have been charged and have no film. I think you need to find a better way of listing your films so customers get a version that is watchable in the country in which the consumer resides!"
1,Very disappointed,"I started to watch the 2nd Season and was very happy with it but decided to stop so I could see it from the beginning. I proceeded to buy Season 1 and saw that I had Instant Video come with it. I was so excited to not have to wait to see the 1st episode...Well I was definitely dissipointed, extremely disgusted by 2 men kissing in the first season. I thought these were family films! Horrible and in very Bad Taste! I canceled immediately and will not buy from Masterpiece Classics. I wish I would have read the 1 star reviews."
1,Not the best purchase,"I was such a fan of the original series that I just had to try this update. I was really disappointed. The characters are not believable and the acting is somewhat stiff. The story was just boring. It would be ok to watch on TV, but I'm sorry I wasted money on the DVD. I probably won't watch it again."
4,Masterpiece Theater Downton Abbey,"I've been ask to review this series. In all fairness I've only viewed 4 episodes of Season one. Thus far,It appears to be a remake of Upstairs Downstairs. It is good- but somewhat predictable. Perhaps,I'll find it more enjoyable, nuanced and complex as I move deeper in to the series."
5,something new,I just recieved this and am very pleased with it. It is easy to pick up on and not choppy at all as previous others had stated. The acting is very good and I really like the story line and the people. I am looking forward to season two. I am watching season three on pbs and love it.
5,Perfect!,"If you loved UPSTAIRS, DOWNSTAIRS, you will love this series, too!Magnificent cast, great storyline, beautifully filmed.Dame Maggie Smith owns the series. She can do more with one facial expression than most can do in a lifetime of acting."
5,I am a believer,My friends encouraged me to watch this. Enjoyed every minute. Good characters. So much going on. Have ordered Season 2.
5,"Only watched ep. 1-3, so far but it's really good.",It's like Pride & Prejudice and Wuthering Heights meets Desperate Housewives. I would recommend it to young adults and up.
4,I just love Downton Abbey,"I do just love the story Downton Abbey. Because I completely missed the first season on PBS and parts of the 2nd. Therefore I chose to watch in on my computer...I am not able to use the HD version which I ordered, but am watching the normal version...I am very disappointed that I did not order the original English version as upon reading some of the other reviews I find that a lot of the original show has been cut for PBS!! I do wish I could just exchange it for the original version. I have ordered the 2nd season of the original show which I am grateful for. Is there any chance I could exchange the PBS version for the original first season?? I also want you to know I do love my Prime membership at Amazon and your excellent customer satisfaction policies!! Sincerely, Joyce Caulkins"
5,worth watching!,Very entertaining. Loved the characters and the plot. Even my teen age daughter is getting addicted to it. We're watching season 2 and cant wait for season 3 to be available on prime!
5,Excellent series!,Loved watching this series for the first time. Good quality. Appreciate how the video resumes where you left off. Thank you!
5,I got hooked,I had not seen any of these shows so I decided to watch the first one and was immediately hooked. I couldn't stop watching them and only have a few left in season 2 left to see.
5,Very true to historic facts!,"I'm almost too picky about what I watch and read, having it mostly non-fiction, but I will say this series is awesome as it gives a real perspective to what life was like then, and most of the characters have such individual personalities, and so a great job acting!"
5,Well written series!,"Downton Abbey is well written, it takes time to develop each character as the story line moves forward. VERY GOOD! Had to buy Season 2 immediately after watching Season 1."
5,Great PBS sries,"Great store; great setting, terrifc acting. Would recommend for anyone over 18. A superb period piec. Would recommend to anyone with a history interest, especially WWI era"
5,Downton Abbey,I am hooked. I love the story and the costumes. Season 1 was great and can't wait to start season 2.
4,Downton Abbey - thumbs Up,"Downton Abbey is set in the beautiful english countryside with mansion to match. The intrigues of the house staff and the follies of the female upper story occupants kept me ""glued to my seat"" and waiting for more. Craftily done (so that I developed strong dislikes for some personalities and sympathy and understanding for others)the dialogue was sharp, witty and well paced.For one who grew up in a britsh colonial environment, I thoroughly enjoyed the character of Dame Maggie Smith. She is CLASSIC. Undoubtedly, this is the best period piece I have seen in a long time."
5,Wonderful!!,"Started watching yesterday because I had nothing better to do & I was immediately hooked!This show is a jewel, especially with so much bad TV nowadays. I loved all the characters but my favorite ones have to be Mary and Anna. I do hope the series had included a little bit more development of the relationship between Mary and Matthew but I suppose with so many characters and so little time not everyone can get everything they want.I will start watching series two as soon as possible (I finished series 1 today) and count the days until the Christmas special and Series 3!Thank you Amazon for making this available for Instant watch, & thank you Downton Abbey for existing and coming into my life lol."
5,A good mini-series!,"This is a good one too. I am partial to most of BBC's offerings and this was definitely another good one. The main actor is the fellow who played Mr. Timmons in the equally good ""Lark Rise to Candleford"" series. The actors and actresses are all very well cast, and have genuine personality (in their rolls).It's on the drama side of life, but the show is suitable for anyone. Albeit, the kiddo's might not care for the pace."
5,Very entertaining,"This series is like a Dickens novel. Many twists and turns, evil characters, and admirable ones too, some more believable than others."
5,Downton Abbey,First class drama--insight into the historical times although a work of fiction. Loved most of the characters. Course you have to have someone to dislike in all shows--that's what makes them work!
1,Downton Abbey - Wrong size.,This Blu-ray is shown to be in 1.33 aspect ratio. There is a 1.78 wide-screen version available but they want $60 for it. Don't get the pan-and scan-version and miss out on the wonderful scenery!
5,S' MARVELOUS,"Top notch acting. Wonderful character development. Gives us common folk a glimpse of a world unknowable, but can see the humaness of it. No matter the class, everyone has same virtues and vices."
3,Don't be fooled!,"The product itself is great. It's a wonderful show. It gets 5 stars. However, this is not the entire Season 1. I upgraded to a paid prime membership (I have enjoyed some benefits of prime membership as a guest of another prime member, something I am not sure Amazon even offers any more) specifically to watch this show and rationalizing that the paid membership price is better than a year of Netflix. I was surprised to learn that only episode 1 of season 1 is included for free. I ended up purchasing episodes 2-7 at a cost of $9.99. So, all told, Season 1 cost me almost $90. It's deceptive to label it Season 1 and indicating it's free with paid prime. And on it goes with Season 2....."
5,love this show,Love this show. watched 2 seasons in 2 days. didnt leave a lot of time for much else even showering.
5,"Wow, unexpectedly great",This type of series did not seem like something my husband and I would be interested in. We decided to watch the first episode to see why everyone was talking about this show and we were immediately hooked. We watched the whole season in about 2 days. It is difficult to say why we like it so much but definitely the acting is top notch. The story is unique (for us) in that we've not seen much done on the British aristocracy but it really is fascinating. As each episode goes on we found ourselves very tied to each character and wanting to see what happens next.
5,obsessed!,"This is the best series I have yet to watch. Love the time period and the attention to detail in the settings and costumes. Love the way they depict the changing culture as WW I draws to an end, and how electricity,telephones, and automobiles change their daily lifestyles. Love getting to observe the daily life of the servants of an estate of that size , and how class dictated one' s lot in life. Acting is superb, Writing is superb. I was as hooked after first episode, Really can't say enough. I do wish PBS would not edit the episodes for American television. I only watch the UK version."
5,Beautiful costume soap opera!,"Great acting and gorgeous costumes make this well worth watching. The scenery is England at it's best. Wonderful acting and interesting insight into the ""downstairs"" world."
3,"Entertaining, but overrated","Downton Abbey is okay, nothing more.The best thing about it is the superb photography.The context of the time period and it's political atmosphere are very interesting, but the rest of the story is hackneyed soap opera.The characters are almost entirely one dimensional. Good or bad people with very little in between. One of the things that makes for great drama are contradictions in the personalities of the characters. Something this series avoids to it's detriment.Some of the acting is excellent, but some is not good. Maggie Smith is, of course, excellent, but we've seen her do this kind of part sooo many times before. Elizabeth McGovern is one of the most boring actresses I know. She is just not on a par with the rest of the cast.Despite the homosexual element (that many small-minded people here have freaked out over), the series avoids examining the sexuality of the characters in any great depth.A handsome and entertaining, though disappointingly shallow, production."
3,I have a problem!,To Whom It May Concern:I am glad to have this opportunity to write to you. One of the discs sent in the Downton Abbey collection is cracked and I am not sure what the procedure is to get this back to you so it can be replaced. It is the first disc. Any help you can give to me is appreciated!Lorraine Ryan
5,Upstairs Downstairs Updated!,"No need for a lot of words--this is extremely well written, extremely well directed and extremely well acted. If you loved ""Upstairs, Downstairs"" you will love this. If you buy and love ""Downton Abbey"" and you never saw ""Upstairs,Downstairs"" then you must buy that too-immediately. It's about time Masterpiece Theater made it back to the way it was!"
5,Downton Abbey,I really liked Downton Abbey season one. I ordered it because I wanted to watch it after all the raves it got but didn't want to start with season three. It is addictive! It is easy to follow and the acting is outstanding. I can stop it any place and pick it up and continue without any technical problems.
5,Wonderful Series,"Fabulous! I was late to catch on to this wonderful series! Great way to catch up! Characters are wonderful, as is story!"
4,Downton Abbey PBS and UK versions,"I purchased Season 1 of Downton Abbey not realizing at the time that there are two versions, UK and PBS. Is it me? If I recall correctly, in Season 1 PBS version, I presume, Lady Sybil runs off with Branson, marries him, becomes politically active and pregnant. When I got to Season 2 UK Version, there is no mention of a pregnancy nor any indication that she is married to Branson. She is also training to ulitmately help the war effort as a nurse. What gives? Amazon can you get us the UK version of Season 1? Watching different versions does give one a disjointed feeling, as one of the other reviewers noted."
4,Them and Us,"No doubt watching this programme on TV with constant commercial breaks gives the impression of a somewhat leisurely pace, but on DVD it consists of 7 episodes of non-stop action and intrigue, with plots and sub-plots at every turn. The time scale involved is quite short and on that basis it is unrealistic to compare it with such TV series as Upstairs Downstairs which, though similar in storylines, ran for years and covered generations of the same family. For value and enjoyment, this is the edition to buy."
5,Simply this best!,Downton Abbey is simply the best series ever on TV! Love it! Both in storyline and characters this series keeps you interested and longing for more!
5,Tantalizing,The story line is fabulous. The characters all fit their parts. The music is wonderful. You feel like you are right thereinside the house with the family. The house is amazing.
5,ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL.,"I HAD NO DISLIKES. I ONLY HAVE TO FIND THE TIME TO WATCH ALL OF THE EPISODES. THE QUALITY OF PICTURE IS QUITE CLEAR AND OUTSTANDING. FOUND IT QUITE BY ACCIDENT AND HAVE REALLY ENJOYED ""CATCHING UP"" ON ONE OF MY FAVORITE SHOWS,"
4,Basically worthy of the hype!,"Just starting this series I can see why everyone likes it, but I don't LOVE it yet. I probably will the more I get into it. It's very haunting. A great period piece!"
3,downton abby,"I too have seen what a botched up job was done on Downton Abby as there are several scenes missing,why cant people just leave things alone instead of trying to think what is good for the people, PBS are saying this is the English version uncut they are doing the same thing, that the banks did and hope no one noticed, what was going to be a great show now turns into people saying what happened to that scene,and PBS are always saying support us what a joke when they do things like this,maybe its time to let them do with out our support."
5,Praise for Downtone Abbey,"When PBS showed the first episode of this wonderfully written and acted series, my mother and I fell in love with it. I immediately came here to buy it. If you love Maggie Smith, Jullian Fellowes work, or Period Dramas you will love Downton Abbey."
1,Unpleasantly surprised,"(This is not a review, but rather a content warning.)I recently saw on broadcast TV part of a first season episode and thought this mini-series had promise. I reviewed many of the reviews here on amazon, and saw mostly praise, with a few negative reviews based mostly on what did not make it into video versions. So, I bought a copy.However, within the first 30 minutes of the first episode a sodomite ""love"" scene compelled me to stop the player, apologize to my wife and trash season one. Ruined.It's getting more and more difficult to find modern productions which have not been altered to include sodomite characters and themes. I'm sorry I wasted my money on this filth."
3,It's Been Done Before,"Once you get past the blatant plagiarism - the gay scene that some object to has its antecedent in ""Upstairs, Downstairs"" when a visiting German nobleman has a dalliance with the footman, the flower show in ""Mrs. Miniver,"" the overall story line in ""Pride & Prejudice"" - the sets, costumes and acting are good enough, but not great; thus only 3 stars. One more reason to cut PBS' funding: aiding and abetting Bowdlerized plagiarism with public funds."
1,downton abbey,I took a chance on buying the dvd from you as i was not sure it would play on the dvd player we have here in australia. it did not but i can watch it perfectly on my computer so no problem there. my daughter had purchased dvds from usa before and they worked perfectly. i took the chance that i could watch the discs on tv but will watch on the computer instead. lovely picture on the computer so am happy i took the chance. whether i will buy anymore i dont know will have to think on that. dont have any problems with the product or service received from amazon. thanking you
1,Downton DVD set.,"Not very happy with this as it arrived one disc short. It's a 3 disc set but only recieved discs 2 & 3 in a sealed pack. I haven't seen it yet but I'm told it's great.""Not Happy Jan"""
5,Excellent,"Great Genre, exceptional Limey product, makes me morose over the West End Theaters which have so readily accessible variety that seems so much easier to access than anywhere in the States."
5,Love the UK version,My wife and I just love this excellent program. Especially enjoy the extra scenes that are in the UK version.
3,It's okay,Plan on watching more to see if it gets better as it goes along. It was just okay for me at this point.
5,Yes!,You must watch this show if you haven't already. Great story lines lovely and horrible characters you love or hate! It's amazing!
5,Dennis the Menace,This is a great movie. I always liked the TV Show. I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes movies based on TV Shows.
3,poorly packaged,"Movie appeared to have been stored away for a VERY LONG time. It simply did not look like a new case, although unopened. However, will keep it as I promised my grandson we would watch it over the Christmas break."
5,Worked great and a good price,"Just replaced the cat-5 in my house with cat-6, and wanted some new patch cables to run to my equipment.These are well constructed, and unlike some of the snagless ones I use in my job (network engineer), these are easy to remove... Nothing irritates me more than cables that don't' let you depress the tab easily to remove them from the jack... These don't bind at all. Nice vibrant color as well. Everything is running at a good speed now, no complaints about these."
5,Awesome!,"I have not heard the later version with the newer tracks. The first version, with ""He"" and ""God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen,"" is absolutely splendid. Jars of Clay prove their versatility and artistic prowess. They are definitely not crackpots, rather they are indeed treasures in jars of clay. You'll love the way they sound on these favorite Christmas tracks."
1,The Bitter Tears of Petra Von Kant,"I don't know if it was bad acting or simply a bad script. The acting was stiff. Maybe something was lost in the translation. But it seemed they took a 10 min dialogue and stretched it to 2 hours. Basic story left me saying get over it, get on with it. I fast forewarded through most of it and didn't miss anything. If you're a lesbian looking for a movie with strong female interaction, it's not this one. This movie, definitely was not worth the money."
3,"Handy, but not Necessary","Good for supplementals, interesting weapons and unusal rolls. Has info on Salubri, Samedi, and Daughters of Cacaphony in the modern nights, but overall something you can live without."
2,BREAKs--,"i started out really liking this translator, but one I carried it in my bag for about 2 days the plastic screen started cracking eventually the whole thing and off and now it is almost useless if i want to carry it around. I would highly suggest getting a translator with a flip screen so the screen cannot be damaged and you will not have to buy another one like I have to."
4,A great book for the spiritual begginner,If you would like a first step in to the world of spirituality this is a great bok for you. I wish I had something like this when I was asking questions of life and starting out. Jeff breaks the larger answers of life down in to understandable bites.
3,"Great little ""BOOSTER SHOTS"" for leaders...","I purchased this book while traveling. It stood out while I was perusing the leadership/managment/motivation shelf at one of those airport book stores. I am glad I bought it... Although many of the ""motivators"" were very familiar to me... and I knew this book would not contain any depth, (come on people the title states ""Minute Motivators"" and that is what it is...) it did give me a great ""boost"" in my otherwise ""travel weary"" being! I keep it with me to reread and get a quick motivating boost when I need it!Dr. Faron Boreham"
4,Good but redundant,"I like the ""Positive"" nature of this book. It encourages leaders to take their seriously and to avoid getting too power-hungry. I also like that it includes several references to scripture, although not on every page. It gives a moral look at leadership without being over-the-top."
4,Poetry in Motion,This book was shipped promptly and came in great condition. Great for use in an elementary classroom.
2,Not nearly as good as the first DVD,"We got a lot out of the first video, it was like Hellen Keller and the water sign to my child. The second DVD is not nearly as good at teaching signs as the first. It moves very quickly, they spend little time reinforcing the meaning of the sign - blink and they've moved on. They barely show the actual signs. A new child is featured whose signing motions are very off base, he does not belong in an instructional DVD. My daughter is now doing mystery signs, she is developing a sign language speech impediment. We will have to switch to the Signing Times videos."
4,"Sharing Signs is cool, but I think the first one is still the favorite to my little fan....","Thank you for teaching more important signs, such as ""please"", ""thank you"", ""mommy"", ""daddy""! This was a terrific addition that the initial video didn't have. Great idea!I think my little one still prefers the first video, but this one still rates well with her too.In my opinion, it seems individual focus on the sign is to short. This video needs a ""repeat play"" option on the menu to really get the signs down well. I really liked the ""socks"" song she signs at the end."
5,vinyl,This is a record review to give vinyl lovers a review. This album sounds great a vast improvment over the 1974 lp and yes the cd. Midnight Flyer really rocks the whole lp has more body.This is no brainer if your an eagles fan and you know vinyl soundsbetter. Buy It (you.ll be glad you did)
1,Didn't last a day,"I don't have anything to say about how hot this thing would get because I took mine out of the box, plugged it in, and the green light would start flashing. I did check the instructions and trouble shooting, and I will say this is the first time I've had to read the owners manual for a heating pad. Anyhow, there was nothing in there about that symptom; I could not use the control to turn the thing off, and it never got hot. Bummer, now my neck still hurts. Guess it's another night of Icy Hot."
3,"Convenient, but questionable design","The mini jars do function, with the Oster processor. However, there has been one ""uh oh"", where a gasket slipped into the jar and was chewed up. I've been diligent in checking to be certain that the gasket doesn't protrude into the path of the blades. But it is hard to view, through the frosted plastic. Am not sure why, but there's a tendency to misalign, when screwing on the base. I suspect that there may be a slight discrepancy with threading that contributes to the problem. The base smoothly installs on the large glass pitcher, without any difficulty. The screw on lids do not provide a tight seal and are more cosmetic than functional."
4,A good history for non-scholars,"I am not a scholar of Chinese history. I just wanted to know more about the culture. I found the book to be very enjoyable. The topic was too broad for the book to spend much time in any detail of the subject. The book is well reasoned and excellent for those of us that want to know the basics about Chinese history. For those that read the other reviewer comments, bear in mind that the book covers Chinese history for prehistoric time to present day. Any commentary about US policy occurs in the very tail end. The book does do a good job contrasting the Chinese outlook to the western viewpoint."
3,"Very Informative, Painfully Dry","This book certainly provides a complete chronology of China's political, military, and economic history, but it is like dry wheat toast - good for you, but not very enjoyable. In places, the authors themselves seem uninterested in the subject. For example, the end of thousands of years of imperial rule is dispensed in one paragraph - no discussion. Personally, I wish I had bought a different book."
3,A Good Basic History!,"I agree with the many different comments people have had for this book. It contains a lot of information, its very dull at times, and it does not go into great depth all the time.The bottom line is that is exactly what this book is. Its a short basic history of China. This is more of a reference book than a specific look at a very specific event.No, China experts will not be in love with this book. But anyone looking for a survey of Chinese History or looking for a decent desk/bookcase reference book on China will find this book useful."
3,General Text but Provides Good Understanding,"This review of Chinese history spans the entirety of Chinese history, however the edition that I bought only spanned until the middle of Deng Xiaoping's administration. Focusing primarily on trends and patterns over each period of history rather than on dates, names, and places, the reader can truly understand what was happening in Chinese daily life as opposed to just the major political leaders' lives. The author does infer at some points that the reader has a general understanding of certain events, so a complimentary textbook would be helpful."
2,"Not that bad, but not that good.","I do feel that Fielder deserves more than one star for his efforts. He does take some good photographs. But he has built his reputation - not from the quality of his photographs - but from the fact that he owns his own publishing company. And there definitely are better photographers out there than Fielder. If you really want to learn how to take better photographs, I would have to recommend that you look elsewhere."
2,Arrogant and Annoying,"I recently purchased this book on the advice from a fellow photographer that critiqued my work as an amatuer photographer. He said that this book helped him personally in his photography. I'm half way down with this book and find Fielder unappreciative of his ability. I agree that he is a good photographer, but the way he explains his photos is annoying. On a decent photo he will go into detail about the composition and how you eye flows across the picture. Sorry, but some of the photos he describes are not as good as he thinks. If you are looking for a ""how-to"" book, don't pick this one. Try John Shaw's Nature photography and you will get your moneies worth."
5,sturdy solution,"This whole package was a very practical and economic solution when living in an apartment because I can't install permanent fencing. While technically ""temporary"" the fencing is sturdy and doesn't look like it's something that can easily be ripped out by kids - like my previous scalloped wire fencing did. I found the prices to be similar to what I later found locally at a Garden Center and I would have preferred to purchase locally just to avoid the wait."
5,Great Movie!,This movie is hilarious. I have met many overzealous parents who continue the trek right into their children's adulthood. This movie pokes fun at that. The story is very funny and the acting is first rate. You cannot watch this and not laugh.
1,NO STARS!,i remember seeing this movie a long long time ago...this is quite possibly the worst movie i have ever seen.
4,Some real belly laughs,"If ever a boy was overshadowed and controlled by his mother, Stallone is it. He actually makes you believe that he is in such turmoil with his feelings about his mom and girlfriends. In the late 80's when big box office draws like Arnold & Bruce were trying their hands at comedy it was Sly's turn. Although this falls short at times and especially at the end, it is so enjoyable watching Estelle and Sly interact as mother and son that the premise is believable. However, some of the bad guy situations are not. The bad guys are portrayed like idiots and don't really create a good sense of danger for mother & son, he being a cop. But, there are plenty of real howls that carry this 20 some odd year old picture. If you want something not too deep and fun I recommend this."
4,an original favorite,"I saw this back in the eighties and instantly thought it was great. At the time I was finally a good gay film with an actual story instead of some low budget film festival travesty. Also the first time to see Steve Buscemi, Kathy Kinney (Mimi from Drew Carey Show) and that guy John(?) Bolger who went on to play Philip Spaulding for a short while on Guiding Light and then I think he went on to Bold and Beautiful. Still it's a great film worth getting."
3,Wouldn't you like to receive a diary such as this one...,"This one was different - haven't you ever wished you could ask your mother or grandmother questions about their lives, personal questions. After her grandmother's funeral, Pilar is given the gift of her nana's (grandmother) diary and, boy, is it an eye-opener. A family secret is included in the diary that helps put all of the pieces of the family puzzle in place. It is information needed to help Pilar understand her mother. Her nana wants Pilar to make her own decisions for her happiness and not be influenced by her mother. But Pilar must first learn what it is she truly wants out of life. Her grandmother shares the importance of being a lady, art being able to seduce a man through food, and then the talent of being a courtesan to the man/lover/husband to keep him satisfied. It's a different kind of read. Good, but slow for me in parts. But you need to try it and see what you think. I am glad I read it but it's not a keeper for me."
3,Not so funny,"Although my husband and I have ""gone fishing instead of wishing"" more than our share in the past, neither one of us found these ""tales"" of fishing and hunting, etc. to be hysterical or particularly funny. My husband finished the Moon Holler Misfits book but I didn't as I have too many other books to read.It is one of those cases of ""different strokes for different folks."
1,Fire Hazard,"I bought a 12x15 inch Kaz SoftHeat heating pad in December 2007. On 12/07/2008 the electrical cord unexpectedly broke at the junction of the cord and the blue stress reliever, shorted out, and began sparking. Fortunately, I was not shocked or burned. The pad had seen daily use due to a back condition, but it was not abused. I have contacted Kaz for a refund. The materials used in the pad appear to be inferior and I won't buy any more of their products."
3,pop songs from the eighties,"This was a gift for my wife. I like some of the songs, and if you like their singles, this is a good album to get. I kinda fancied the singer more than the songs back in the day ... oh well lol"
5,Great movie for Jack Wild or Donovan fans,"Really, this movie was a lot better than I expected it to be. Granted, it is very sad, and it could be downright depressing if you aren't a Jack Wild fan. But the quality was good, nice colors. The sound quality was almost as good, but not quite. Although this movie is rated G, there are a few things that couldn've gotten it PG, such as a man and woman hugging suggestively, a man being burned at the stake, a few swear words, etc. Nothing major.But if you're a Jack Wild fan, Or a Donovan fan, GET THIS FILM! You won't regret it."
3,Is there a plot here?,"The story of Jake and Tor is interesting. But there is SO much sex going on between these two you'd think it was about 2 rabbits. I was not impressed with the story line in the book. To me it came across as contrived and that the plot was built around the sexual antics of these two testosterone-loaded characters.Don't get me wrong, the book was a fun read...it just left me wanting for a better overall plot, the ending of the book was obvious to me about 1/3 of the way through the book."
4,"Good Hardware, Bad Software","Great little device, much better than the 300 (which I also have), though not quite as intuitive (meaning I had to actually look at the instructions). More memory, backlit display, track description and USB are all great improvements.The software however leaves much to be desired. I still haven't quite figured out how to use it, and probably won't bother. Another reviewer mentioned that MusicMatch Jukebox also download to the Rio. I haven't tried this yet, but if it works, it's the way to go."
3,Good effort,This movie isn't bad. It's not perfect and does have it's flaws but the end product is entertaining. Wolf Town is a nice little piece that is much much better than SyFy original garbage. I say it's at least worth a rental. I will admit that I'm partial to ghost towns and the one in the film is pretty nice.- Charlie MorganAuthor of Sticks And Stones
1,Silly all around,"These young folks go on a road trip to a ghost town and are attacked by wolves. Add some bad dialogue, obviously fake stunts and blood and some goofy acting, and what do you get? Pretty much a waste of time with no purpose and no reason for these wolves to want to inhabit a town. They live in the woods, after all!"
3,synopsis,"The timid and insecure Kyle has a crush on Jess and he invites her to go to the Paradise ghost town as a pretext to be close to her. He brings his best friend Ben with him, but Jess comes with her boyfriend Rob. Kyle drives his convertible to the town and sooner Ben is deadly wounded by a ferocious pack of wolves. The trio of survivors is surrounded and trapped by the smart wolves and they have to be brave enough to face the animals."
2,Not worth the price.,"If I buy a book on 2x4 furniture, thats what I expect. Only 1/2 of this book is dedicated to the title. The rest of the book is projects using 1x2, 1x4 and so forth. That said, the 2x4 projects they did have weren't all that appealing or exciting."
5,Princess Holly-13 says its GREAT!,"I really like this. I got it for christmas. I can type in my spelling words and studdy with it. Its also nice incase i leave it on, it turns off after a min. Or you can set it. It also has fun games. When i play the board game scrabble i can type in the letters i have and it will tell me the words i can make. Some of them i didn't even know exested. Overall This is a great product and its real educational. You should get it its worth every penny!"
1,If it only worked...,"I bought this as a gift for Christmas thinking it would be useful. It would be if it would work. The first one I bought worked for maybe and hour then stopped. I tried the troubleshooting, which did not help. I exchanged it and the second one didn't work from the beginning. I would have to press a key many times before it would show on the screen. Then nothing showed up and I could not even turn it on or off. For such a well-known company, their customer service has much room for improvement."
5,"El inicio de la Trilogía: ""Silvio - Rodriguez - Dominguez""","Este es el primer disco de la Trilogía que Silvio bautizó con su propio nombre; el CD nos da un viaje de poesia y canción, en donde podemos encontrar temas como ""El Necio"", un tema de alto contenido social, donde Silvio nos muestra su fidelidad a la Revolución Cubana; también encontramos temas como ""Quien Fuera"", la que sin duda es una de esas canciones que van más allá de una simple composición musical y nos adentra a algo más que un sentir, temas como estos perece ser que solo Silvio pudo haberlos compuesto. Al final del disco Silvio nos regala una fantastica melodia: ""Crisis"", no tine letra alguna, pero Silvio nos transmite lo que algún día su padre le enseñó: ""La vida es bella y en colores""."
3,Mediocre piece in this series,"I read Gore Vidal's Lincoln prior to reading this one. While I found the former enthralling and a towering accomplishment, Vidal's Washington DC is mediocre at best. Some of the techniques that Vidal came to perfect in Lincoln can be seen here - but the book is loosely written and gives frustratingly small glimpses of President Roosevelt; but not enough to give the novel real weight.In Lincoln, the author unerringly zeroes in on Lincoln and the context of the times and all the other characters are presented in detail and in contrast.Here, the Democratic Senator Day and his protege, a Kennedyesque, Clay Overbrook are presented as the protagonists and Roosevelt is kept in the background. This angle does not work and too much time is spent on sexual shennanigans and other sundry episodes to give the book any genuine thrust (so-to-speak).Neverthless, Gore Vidal has an excellent writing style, and the book ends up being readable - I finished it two sittings."
3,"Interesting for what it is, but not a good book","CN Torrie was an interesting book needless to say, but in the whole grand scheme of things I didn't like it. The char's were cardboard cutout's with a few execptions. Mainly the Nosfuratu.All in all, if you are a White Wolf fan you are going to buy the book. If not, I say don't bother.I just hope CN Tzimece is better."
3,No idea...,"I bought it as a gift, he apparently liked it enough, he continued the series longer than he continued seeing me... :o)"
1,Brokeback Mountain Previews on Leave it Beaver DVD?,"Golly Wally! Why would Universal think this is appropriate? Last time I checked, the Beaver was not living an alternate lifestyle nor was he a cowboy. Why would Universal think this is good preview for this DVD?"
1,"Show OK, DVDs suck.","NO joy knowing I'm not alone regarding Universal. My quibble is the DVDs are 2-sided, so very easy to scratch especially played on MacBooks.The show's great, love how a whole story can be completed in 20 minutes.Would have gotten Season II except the whole experience freaked me.Not just with Universal but as much with amazon.I emailed amazon suggesting that as one of the major retailers, amazon should write in to Universal.Sadly, amazon couldn't be bothered. Just refused to help.Took me a while to buy DVDs from amazon again.Universal, please stop the double-sided DVD nonsense."
2,Leave It To Beaver-First Season,"Though I could view all the episodes, this DVD collection seems to have been pirated!! There are no labels on the DVDs and they are much thicker than other DVDs. I put one in a player [like those in a vehicle without a tray that slides out] and it jammed my player. This was in a camper and the entire unit had to be replaced. OUR COST $700!!!! This has never happened to any other DVDs we have. Needless to say, all of the series of LITB will NOT be played on our new one. We only play these in players that have a tray that slides out now."
5,Finally!!,I have loved this show since I was a little kid. I'm now 50 and still love it. I have been waiting for the DVD so I can ditch my out of sequence and inferior VHS that I taped from T.V. with commercials intact. Yuk. The first seaon had many touching episodes and I loved it when the boys were little. Hurry up November!
3,"Beaver was great, Universal isn't","""Leave it to Beaver"" was, and is a classic sitcom. There's no problem giving the show itself a 5 star rating. However, I would hold off giving this DVD release a glowing review given ""Universal Studios"" shabby treatment of their dvd releases in the past. These folks don't put any care into their treatment of the material they put out. They're known for their ""flipper"" (dual sided discs) that freeze, skip, and the overall quality of some the previous releases have been extremely frustrating to anyone who has dished out hard earned money for these discs. Until Universal changes this, I've learned it's best to wait, and see what kind of quality you're getting."
1,Universal has disgraced this great work,"Take one of my favorite shows of all time (that I've loved since I was about 5yrs old) and put it on 3 disks with the worst possible quality video reproduction and you have a monumental disappointment. The first season was probably the best and has almost 40 episodes, however, as soon as I put the disk in all I could focus on was the grainy fuzz that's like watching a tv with bad reception; the picture detail is slightly sharper than cable broadcasts, but the overall quality is much worse (not what I expect from DVD). Universal execs and management who released this series should be ashamed to treat customers this way. If you feel this way, show them what you think by returning the DVDs (say it doesn't play properly) and write Universal."
2,A Baby Toy,"My 5 month old enjoys this more than my 3 year old, the one this toy was intended for! It isn't at all stimulating for an older child, and does the same thing over and over. Elmo is of course lovable and cute, but this, in my opinion, is a waste of a toy and will get old very quickly."
3,Good while it lasted,"Since he was an infant, our son has LOVED the Chicken Dance, and when he was 5.5 months we bought him Chicken Dance Elmo. At first he thought it was odd, but then he started to like it and we knew that whenever he was upset Elmo could get him to calm down. Eventually, at 7 months he went through a phase where he no longer wanted to be changed on his changing table. Wouldn't you know, Elmo was the the one toy that could occupy him long enough for us to change his diaper.My BIG disappointment with Elmo is that he is not very durable. We used him for entertainment purposes only and after two months he just stoppped singing. He still clucks like a chicken if you press his foot, but when you press the other foot nothing happens (no song and dance). We thought it needed more batteries but after trying that its clear that Emlo is broken. Which is too bad since we really liked this toy."
3,Taught my daughter the chicken dance!!!,"My 2 year hold daughter recieved this toy for christmas, and was scared of it at first, but when she warmed up to it she started flapping her arms like a chicken and danced and hummed the song all around the house. She doesn't really play with it alot, but from time to time she will pull it out and do a little dancing!!I think it is adorable when she does the ""chicken dance""!!"
4,Do the chicken dance everybody,"My 8 month old son loves this toy. He even dances with Elmo. I am surprised how much he still loves it. He doesn't know how to press his foot yet, but he loves it when we do it for him. Very cute overall."
3,Pretty Good Toy - Bored of it After a While,"My one-year old loved this toy when he first got it, but seems to be bored with it now. I have to press the foot and remind him that the toy is there - it's not something he goes looking for. For the most part it is a great toy and really cute to watch Elmo dance the chicken dance."
1,A sad dance for Elmo,"This product is sooooooo not worth it! I believe that my daughter is the #1 Elmo fan and she laughed at it for about 5 minutes and then it bored her..................It's not even the full ""chicken dance"" that's on an Elmo video we own (one of the reasons I bought it)...............the material that the feet are covered with is so cheap that my daughter (at the time 9 months old) ripped it easily the first day...........Do not waste your money on this product!"
3,For true Elmo fans only.,"Along with Hokey Pokey Elmo, Chicken Dance Elmo sits sadly unused on my son's toy shelf. He was fun for a time. I heard the chicken dance more times than I could count at the beginning. After a month or two, the novelty wore off. My suggestion, if you can get this on sale, go for it. It is not worth full price."
5,Had to take it home,"I bought three as an investment. I took one to work but had to take it home because people would walk into the office and push his buttons.I have him by the front door to give me a lift before I go to work. I love my Chicken Dance Elmo.GoosePS If you buy as an investment, remove the batteries."
5,Works great with FiOS,"We recently had FiOS (fiber optic TV) installed in our house, but we have no cable outlet in the kitchen. I had a small countertop rabbit-ear TV for watching news and Jeopardy! while cooking, and after it died, I searched for a replacement without much luck. Then I saw the Slingbox, and decided to try that with my router and laptop. It works great! I set it up in about 5 minutes, and now I can watch basic cable (mainly over-the-air stations plus Weather Channel and TV Guide) in the kitchen with no extra costs for a digital box, and no more antenna fiddling! Picture and sound are excellent. I haven't even tried setting it up so I can get TV away from home, but just as an ""extension TV"" at home, the Slingbox is very useful."
2,Ok but crippled software,"Honestly I don't know why Slingbox has such a huge following. It's a decent product (works great on LAN, so-so away from the house unless you have a 4+ Mb connection), but the software is essentially crippleware. This is the only video product that I've ever had that doesn't support video recording. I used to own ATI and Matrox video cards...their software supported TV connections PLUS video recording. Why can't this product replace my Tivo... my computer is fast enough and has plenty of hard drive space?! Also, why can't you view it on more than one computer at a time? OR why can't you but a ""deluxe"" version with two tuners inside that will let you view on more than one computer at a time.This has the potential to be a killer product but in my mind is only mediocre because of the limitations that they've built into the software."
4,"I like it, not love it","Easy to set up and works as advertised. Picture quality has a lot to do with cable signal and internet speed. I would buy it again but I do have a few complaints. It only works on analog signals from the cable company, so when they switch to all digital, this will not work at all. You do not get the channel information, so channel surfing takes quite a bit longer. They charge another $30 if you want the program for your pda, that sux. Take your time and read about their other units as they can handle digital signals, and control Tivo's etc and you may want that."
5,All delicious reciepes (so far),"I have cooked many of these currires and they are all exceptional and of a great cross-section of the classics . List of spices is long and the final tastes are complex and delicious , the way a top curry should be . Lots of inside info & pics on the finer points of chillies,spices,rices,dals, etc , which I haven't got around to reading . The book is small and concise with great pics to hone in on the evenings meal mmmmm . A great present for someone who is a dedicated curry eater , especially starting out : start with the best !"
2,"Water, water everywhere! READ THIS!",DO NOT add as much water as stated in these curries or you'll end up with a very expensive SOUP. Cut the water by at least one half. Disappointed in the results of the curries and it's all because of the water called for. I feel confident it is a misprint.
3,Disappointed,"This book was a favorite of mine as a child. I was very disappointed in the new edition. First, there are none of the delightful pictures from the original. Second, the cover looked like it was a library book - plain blue, not even a title printed on it. It's the same wonderful stories, but if you remember the original, you'll be disappointed in the way they are presented. 3 stars for the stories, no stars otherwise."
5,A GREAT book about the Apollo program,"This particular book does a great job of getting into the insights of the astronauts when they were front page news. Apollo was truly the pinnacle of NASA and Andrew Smith does a great job of creating the aura that still surrounds the 9 men still living, that walked on another world.I could've done without some of his personal musings, as he paints a picture that you would rather he keep to himself. I have my own personal perspectives and if you didn't grow up in U.K. or CA, you'll probably agree that Andrew should've kept some of his memories out of the pages.Even with the author's anecdotes, the book is 5 stars and worthy reading for any space history buff."
3,Good story; but dated.,"Reading level should be age 12 up, not baby to pre-school. A good story where the youth going bad is straightened out by caring adults. It's dated, maybe a little innocent for today's world, but kids who are already car nuts will probably like it. It's got several technical errors and many grammatical errors. It's probably a good book to give to kids in an eighth grade English class and have them find and correct the errors."
1,"buggy, rushed out product...","Does not work at all on my brand new PC (98se, usb), very bad software, support is helpless... Advertised Audible format is not actually supported ('yet' they say...) Don't buy now... this is a rushed out (though late) buggy product..."
5,You Will Be Happy!!!,"I bought this a couple days ago, and boy am I happy, I give this product 5 stars because it is awesome. I am really happy with the fast usb connection ,and the price."
2,Save your pennies for something better.,"The Diamond Rio is already outdated like other MP3 players... they COULD give you more memory, but they'd rather add 16 megs one model at a time so you have to keep getting new models or purchasing expensive memory cards so you can store more. Would the same 12 songs over and over really keep you entertained on a road trip? I suggest you save up for the HanGo Personal Jukebox or a similar item (Creative Labs is coming out with a big one for less), which will hold a good 1500 songs- at the very least, more than 12! The software also is terrible with Rio and it seems to be a lucky buyer thing... half the time they break after working fine for a month or so. In conclusion, wait for the next generation of MP3 players or pay the price to experience the future now, but don't waste your time on something that will be like the 8-track compared to a CD player in a few weeks."
4,"Great product, bad battery","I recently purchased the Diamond Rio 500 just because I'm a ""new gadget freak."" Upon opening it i immediately loved it. It's tiny enough to conceal and simply looks really ""cool,"" for lack of a better word. The software was easy enough to install, although the instructions are extremely vague. I had to try a couple of times before I even got the USB driver installed.The software is very easy to use and the USB connection allows for extremely fast music transfer.The 2 downfalls of the Rio 500, however, are, of course, the lousy ear buds, and the poor battery life. If you don't intend on changing the music often, then the battery life is just fine. However, if you like to have a little variety now and then, plan on purchasing a lot of AA's.I recommend this unit to anyone who always wants music with them but doesn't want the burden of having to carry around all their cd's or tapes in those big, clumsy cases."
3,Rio 500,"This is a very well designed player. It shipped without instructions of any kind (from Audible) but they are available on the web.Mine doesn't play MP3s well, they sound fuzzy and distorted. As I use mine primarily for audio books it's not a huge issue. If you get one, check it right away for playing quality. I didn't and they won't allow me to return it now.My biggest complaint is it's sensativity. If I bump it, it resets to the beginning of the audio track or song. I don't know if their other products do this but this one is awful in that regard."
5,Good for what its supposed to do,"the rio 500, nearly impossible to get now, is one of the best rio mp3 players out since of its smartmedia card design, apart form the expensive memory backpacks for the rio 600 & 800. Not speicla about it, no extra features on it, just a simple mp3 player, but it plays mp3's well, very satisfied with the product...shouldn't have discontinued them. gets loud, usually mp3 players are bad in that area and batteries last twice as long as a cd player...looks good toosincerelyBOB"
1,"Player excellent, customer service very poor.","Okay, the player is excellent, and I have no problems with it. But customer support for it's software is very very bad.I was forced to register the software it came with for a $10 fee. I then upgraded my system to Windows98 (from Win95) in order download music to the player, but when I re-installed the software, it wanted me to register again.I emailed Diamond and asked if I'd be charged $10 again, and their response (after 3 days) was for me to ""upgrade"", but they never even answer my one question. Not only that, but they didn't specify for me to upgrade what! It was only one sentence. I've replied back to them and they still haven't gotten back to me after 5 days!The software is clunky, not very intuitive.The player is a fun gadget, and I like it, but service is very, very poor.If you buy one, assume you're on your own."
4,Great alternative to portable DC and tape players,"Have used the 500 for about three weeks. Had to email support a few times (because of the pathetic lack of documentation online or accompanying the player); response time varied from 24 to 48 hours, and instructions were clear and solved my challenges. Why can't they print this stuff up and put it on line or include it with the player? The 500 can hold more than the 60 minutes referred to by another reviewer. You determine the copy rate from the cd, and the download copy rate to the player -- and that will determine how many songs you'll get onto the player. The controls are simple and intuitive. I agree w/ previous comment about mesh holder and thanks for the tip for 'fixing' it. I find the software easy and intuitive to use, but it's certainly possible other software programs are even better. My only two complaints are: cost of addt'l memory and lack of documentation. I highly recommend the 500 - buy it now, and upgrade in a few years."
4,Great but expensive and limited gadget,"The Rio is fantastic --the ability to create a tiny portable collection of my favorite songs. For the price,however, I would except much more memory. I will probably go with the mini disc player which has more capacity for essentially the same price. You can get entire desktops for a bit more than the price of the Rio. Increase the memory, lower the price and I will definitely keep one with me all the time."
3,"Doesn't have auto reverse, or dolby noise reduction.","I used my diamond rio, but was upset that it is not compatable with all my old cassette tapes. This is a major flaw, because I have some really nice tapes that I was unable to listen to. There are ways to get around this problem though. I highly reccomend that you duct tape the rio to a good old sony walkman, and groove out that way. This also allows you to look more down to earth, rather than have people get MP3envy over your compact MP3equipment. (Don't try sticking the rio inside of your walkman and closing the walkman's door- it will break the tape spindles of your walkman).64 megs is better than a 60 minutes tape, but you can't flip the chip."
3,fairly product -- Diamond Rio 500,"I've just got it yesterday, it's a great look view with ""iMac like"" style. But when I install it, i get into trouble. I dont like USB device, since it's probably un-stable on the Windows platform, althought the transfeer speed is five time then pareall port.The memory seems better then Creative NOMAD (nomad has 32mb internal, 32mb external) , but 64MB is not enough when I tried higher sample rate for MP3 encoding (160K for 60Min CD , maxinium is 256K)And the memory module is expensive for 32MB/100 USD, its incredible price!Totally, if you want to buy the Rio 500 right now, it's a good choice and i'll bet you will like it, but if you want to buy a MP3 Player/Walkman in the near future, I suggest you prefer the Creative NOMAD 2 (NOMAD 2 is not released yet) multi-functional, greate style, and much more memory size."
4,Great product,"I just bought the Diamond Rio PMP500 and it's great. There are a few downsides though, the software is a little confusing at first but in just a short while I had no trouble with it, the headphones it comes with are uncomfortable and don't have very good sound, also it eats up batteries like crazy and doesn't have an available AC adapter. I suggest buying rechargeable batteries and a charger so you don't go broke buying batteries, and if you do use regular batteries make sure they're something like Duracell Ultra or another battery for high tech equipment. Other than those few downsides the Rio 500 is great, the sound quality is great its very portable and has some great features."
2,"Please don't buy this, it would sadden me....","Ok, some loyal review readers might know that I have the original RIO PMP300. I have basically the same opinion about this player.GOOD - Lightweight, small, decent on battery power, no moving partsBAD - Holds about 44 minutes at 192kbps (almost CD Quality), somewhat priceyUGLY - $100 for an extra 32mb card (22 minutes of almost CD-Quality), Bad memory clusters cause skips over timeSo, unlike my review of the PMP300, with this model I have to recomend not purchasing this item. For this price, you are MUCH better off buying a MiniDisc recorder from Amazon.com! (don't worry Amazon, you aren't losing any business) You can purchase blank MiniDiscs for $1.50 now, and that gives you much more then you get with the Rio for $100 in flash memory (the blank media that music is stored on in the Rio) So, in short, go with something like the Aiwa AM F70 MiniDisc Recorder, I guarentee you will thank me!"
3,"Nice pan, great price. I only have one complaint.","There's a sticker on the box that reads ""Our special gift to you when you purchase $250 or more of Circulon products.""In other words, they're a premium - a giveaway meant for people who buy $250 worth of Circulon items. No wonder Amazon can sell them so cheaply."
5,A classic read in science...,"This book is written more than half a century ago but still holds the basis of science. Starting from the history and leading through all the paradigm shifts, Jacob Bronowski has marvelously mentioned the future of science, the future paradigm.I recommend this to everyone who is interested in a good science read. Old yet, interesting and a must read."
1,Muddled....,"What an unbelievable, messy hodge-podge of a book! A lot of characters to keep straight (even though there was a genealogical chart on the first pages) and if that weren't enough, a wimpy, ""I'll-believe-anything"" heroine to set your teeth on edge! Get this: She's implicated in a murder. Without hesitation, she calmly accepts an invitation to live at the murdered man's house and paint his grandmother's portrait! SURE! There should be no reason to doubt the sincerity of this family! Ick. A real waste of my reading time. Too bad. I kinda liked the hero but the heroine made me sick."
3,Do toys HAVE to do something to be fun?,"Okay, so these little cars don't go beep-beep, have lights that flash, drive by themselves, or have incredibly strong magnets that keep the accessories firmly attached to them. I actually find this a welcome relief from all the overly stimulating toys that are on the market nowadays. Think back to when we were kids... did we have a lot of toys that ""did"" things? No, not really. We had toys that we PLAYED with...that stimulated our own imaginations. I love watching my son and daughter play with ""boring"" toys... it's amazing the things they can come up with! I'd much rather have a ""boring"" toy for my kids than one that just simply makes a lot of noise and puts on a little light show."
3,Consider MWD-1440,"MWD-1840 is the desktop model. Its functions are almost identical to MWD-1440 except MWD-1840 can ""speak"". The speaking function is very poor, the voice is unclear. If you ever hear Microsoft Agent TrueVoice, you don't want to hear a MWD-1840's mutter. I would choose MWD-1440."
4,Franklin MWS 1840 speaking Merriam Webster Dictionary,"This ""AMAZON"" sold item was in good condition, service timely and communication outstanding. Unusually quick response to inquiries highly recommend for costumers who look for these qualities while doing business."
2,The King,"Initially I thought this would be an advance machine with greater speed than the previous Frankling dictionary that I had. Boy was I wrong.... The speed is agonizingly slow and looking up a word especially if you're not sure about the spelling, takes forever. In addition, the unit is much bigger than the previous Franklin's and the buttons do not have a good feel when pressed. And on top of that, the pronounciation needs to be improved greatly. Overall, I feel that Franklin should have done better considering the high price tag of this unit."
3,censorship,"Over all I think it is an okay product. I use MWS-1840 mainly to improve my vocabs. It is handy when I need to look up a word quickly, but I don't think the speaking feature is good for ESL students.The pronunciation is mutter at best, some syllables sound wrong and misleading to ESL students. Because I am a English speaker, I can conjucture from part of the word to understand what it says. This won't work for ESL students.It especially has trouble with the TH sound. Just try words like three and through: they sound like tree and true.The other annoyance is that certain perfectly legitimate words, because they refer to human reproductive organs and sexual acts, they are censored from the speaking function. I can just imaging the embarrassment it causes when ESL teachers and parents are being asked to say these word and being asked why thay are censored. This is just very hypocritical, what are they going to do next, book burnings?"
1,Give Me A Break,"Lynch is laughing again. At least that is what I always imagine. The audience seeking out the deeper meaning when really there isn't any. ""It is brilliant and if I can discover that hidden meaning than I must be brilliant too."" Not! I love films that provide food for thought, but this is not the case with this flick."
1,pretentious,"Without going over the plot as other reviewers have done already, I simply want to say that the emperor has no clothes. This is amateur, pretentious filmmaking at its highest peak. Much sound and fury signifying nothing. The acting is second rate at best and the overall script unbearable to sit through. See if you can tell what the point of it all is. Good luck."
1,Insane drug vision,"This movie was terribly long, interesting at times, but overall very ridiculous. I watched this with a few highly educated friends. We watched this movie, discussed it and dismissed as a pile of incoherent drivel! The acting was extremely well done, unfortunately there was really nothing to do. Save the 2 hours of your life and do something constructive."
2,"Oh, David, You're So Naughty.","David Lynch has made a living in voyeuristic film making. Colors are so bright. Make-up is so perfect. Wardrobe is maticulous. Acting is so campy. But, sometimes I get tired of Lynch trying to go for an effect and wish he would just tell a story. I walked out of the theatre on this one, because I didn't really care about what happened to the characters. I hate when that happens, especially when movies tack on a dream ending that tells you to void what you felt in the first two reels (Jacob's Ladder, etc.). My favorite Lynch film was Blue Velvet. It was lurid and melodramatic, etc., but it at least told a story. Lynch probably gets a kick out of being a ""naughty boy"" or the ""king of kink."" But I hope there are more important things he has to say in the future."
2,head shaker,"This film did have all of your Lynch-isms, and I am a fan of Lynch, but it did not hit home for me. One of the funnest things about Lynch is watching the movies again and figuring them out. I got it for the most part, but honestly I didn't care to give it another veiw even for the sake of proving I could understand everything. I really had high hopes for this movie, but I'm not gonna like it just because its Lynch. If he does another movie with the double-life/doppelganger/dream-realtiy theme its gonna really start to wear thin."
4,compelling weirdness,"Owl Creek Bridge meets Day of the Locust. Another surreal dreamscape from Lynch. Good performances by Watts and Theroux. A few scenes didn't fit, though. They seemed to belong to another movie: loose ends, no doubt, from the projected TV mini-series that never came to fruition. I'm not the biggest fan of David Lynch, but I did find this one fairly compelling and memorable. Some have complained that the film is totally inscrutable, but those who managed to follow the storyline of Memento shouldn't have too much difficulty with this one. Just bear in mind that the first persona we encounter is only an idealized self-image in the fever dream of a mean little failure with a ugly soul. Enjoy.Good transfer but NO extras at all--not even a menu or scene selections, for crying out loud! Cheap b@stards."
1,Biggest waste of time yet...,"Let me set one thing straight, I LOVE movies that make you think. My boyfriend and I watched this waiting for the moment where everything clicked, but there was no moment. This movie is a mess. It has too many characters that are never explained and seems like 4 different movies wrapped in one. Anyone who thought this was a stroke of genius needs to get out more and watch more quality films. If you like putting together puzzles that are missing half the pieces, or contain pieces from multiple puzzles, this one is for you!"
3,Good movie---awful DVD,"This hasn't a single special feature beyond the trailer. Even worse is that this is the first DVD that I ever seen that doesn't allow you to select scenes. There is no chapter select menu, and there is no option while watching the film to skip ahead to the next scene. This movie is has ONE CHAPTER. Rent this film, and wait 3 months to buy it when they sell it again as a Special Edition to all us suckers who couldn't wait."
1,Doesn't play on US bluray players,When reviewing the product details and user reviews prior to purchasing this I didn't see anything about how it only plays on European players. Doesn't play on US blu-ray players.
1,"the movie rocks, the dvd doesnt","this is a great film, but dont buy the dvd. its the worst dvd i've seen. there are no extra features and you cant even select the scenes so fast forwarding would actually be easier on a video copy. there's no way it should cost as much as it does."
2,"Interesting movie, poor DVD special features","My wife didn't like it because she couldn't figure it out. The fact is, no one can figure it out, no doubt including David Lynch. The women in this film are great to look at. ""Diane"" glows from the inside out, and ""Rita?"" . . . fuhgedaboudit! She'll knock yer sox off. The DVD has no Scene Selection feature, which is a serious oversight IMHO. How hard would that have been to include? The sound is either Dolby Digital (2 channels? 5.1?) or DTS (not on my machine!) . . . your choice. No director's commentary or anything other than a trailer."
2,Confusing,"I've watched David Lynch films before, but this movie made no sense. It was too bizzare. When the movie was over I was like I have no idea what the movie was about. It changed in the middle as if it was a dream but it wasn't. Too confusing for this movie lover. Don't bother, it's a waste of time."
1,One of the Worst Films Ever...,"I used to be a David Lynch fan -having enjoyed ""Twin Peaks"" and ""Blue Velvet"" - but unfortunately, ""Mulholland Dr"" is a worthless, waste of time. Lynch makes a tedious 2 1/2 hour film where over half the film is a ""dream sequence."" He not only misleads and cheats his audience..but in this case bores us as well with unnecessary scenes and inane dialogue. Even the ""hot"" lesbian scenes can't revive this stinker. Avoid this film like the plaque."
3,The whole less than the sum,"There are undeniably interesting set-pieces in this film as there are also undeniably awful ones. Lynch, presumably presented this one as an oblique head-scratcher and it is. I'm not convinced, as some viewers seem to be, that it means anything. Each inpretation seems to present holes of their own. All in all, cinephiles should find more than a scene or two to enjoy as long as one loses all expectations that there is any guarantee of relation to the rest of the film."
3,Lost potential.,"This movie is about a suicidal, schizophrenic lesbian who has issues with her parents and is looking for love in all the wrong places. I wanted to like this movie, and in a way I did, but there just wasn't enough substance for me to call it a favorite. Lynch would sort of touch on some very powerful themes but wouldn't delve deeply enough into any one thing build meaning.The fact that there are no sub chapters was really annoying but I guess that's Lynch's way of being artistic.That being said, the performances were superb but it wasn't enough to save the film.The only people who will like this movie are those who create meaning where it is lacking."
1,Great movie; lousy DVD,"I loved this movie. I saw it three times in the theater. But this DVD redefines ""no frills"". No chapters, even!This DVD is worth renting if you would like to see the movie, but buying it would be a waste of money.It's sad that an innovator like David Lynch would fail to exploit the potential of the DVD medium and go all Luddite on us instead."
1,Drive Away!,"This is the worst movie I've ever seen. Worst acting, worst casting, worst editing, worst writing, etc. I would say worst story but there wasn't one. I can't believe someone read this script and said, ""We have to make this into a movie."" I can't believe anyone would give Lynch the money to make it. I can't believe it was voted one of the year's best. This movie is a joke. All I can figure is that it has some kind of hypnotic, subliminal message hidden in it saying, ""Love this movie. Love this movie."" Thank goodness I was immune. There's nothing to love."
2,Excellent film but where's the writing?,"Who are those people and why should I care?Please go fetch ""Last Year at Marienbad"" and see who a puzzle movie should be done.Dune was bad and Twin Peaks has is endless, go get a life!."
3,Twin Peaks + girl-on-girl = disturbing,"Taken as an allegory, Mulholland Drive works well. It's wonderfully scripted and acted when you consider how demanding it is to make ""camp"" palatable, and somewhat eerie at the same time. Mr.Lynch is talented, there's no denying that, but his contempt for his audience is unsettling. Maybe it's just me, but I honestly felt that the last 1/3 of the movie was there to ""break it down"" for those of us that couldn't make the connections. If he had reservations about the plot so much that ""spoon feeding"" the viewer was necessary then here's an idea...don't be so (insert expletive) cryptic!"
5,"intriguing movie, a minimal DVD","I am not exactly a fan of David Lynch. However, I find his movies interesting, and I usually find his movies good eventhough I have no idea why I say they're good. Mulholland Drive is a visual narrative without a timeline. It was intriguing, sexy and inventive.The DVD version contains nothing other than the movie, the trailor and text information about the actors. I was hoping to see the Director's commentary. There was none. It was also interesting that the DVD did not have chapters (which, I am sure is done on purpose to further reflect the meaning of the film.) All in all, a good film that requires more than one viewing."
2,Ho-hum,"Contrary to popular opinion, my feeling is that ""Mulholland Drive"" is derivative rather than original and pretentious rather than profound. In the spectrum of phantasmagoric settings, Los Angeles is a johnny-come-lately. The French were doing this sort of thing a good while ago--and much better. (Try, for instance, ""Celine and Julie Go Boating."")"
3,Silencio,"Mulholland Drive is probably the most accessible of David Lynch's films (except perhaps the Straight Story). I prefer Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me and Wild at Heart for their all out absurdity. But I'm guessing that a second viewing of Mulholland Drive would make it even better, and I bet it was amazing on the big screen. I only saw it on video.Laura Harring is quite delicious in it and the scenes between her and Naomi Watts were steamy. If you don't like weird films, you probably won't like this one. But I think it's worth seeing just for the scene where Rebekah Del Rio sings ""Llorando (Crying)"". Chilling.The movie was written to be a tv pilot and in some ways, it shows a certain weakness in the story and acting. But this also makes it a bit more interesting than something written for a movie."
1,mulholland drive,"add this movie to the long list of crap that david lynch has put out. in fact, this movie would have been better suited starting out w/ him on the toilet ~ at least that way we'd know what we were in for!"
1,Makes your head spin,"I have 4 years of psychology knowledge and experience, so to say this movie is easy to understand. No!! It was bizarre and didn't make any sense and by the end of the movie, you pretty much feel WHO CARES. There were many boring parts also. Well, the movie was boring overall and very is confusing, lacking a plot and lacking sense. All I know is it had something to do with repressed memories, and it was like a puzzle with hundreds of missing pieces. Movies are suppose to enteratin, not to sit all night trying to figure out what's going on in the movie causing an unpleasant thought provoking process. It was way too complicated to the point when you don't enjoy it! I remember exams being funner and easier than understanding this movie. There is no point."
3,I liked this movie a great deal!,"I love all David Lynch movies and this is no exception. It was lovely and full of twists and the 2 lead ladies had great chemistry. So why only 3 stars when the movie is 5 stars for sure?? This sorry dvd! There are no real extras AND there are no chapter selections. This is maddening, especially because this is the kind of movie you might need to watch some parts of several times to really understand. This is maddening I tell you! The VHS would have been better than this!"
2,You might need to watch this one twice.,It starts out as one of those movies where there are a lot of unrelated characters that you think will connect in the end. And about 2/3 through the entire story line breaks down into mass confusion.
1,Just admit it stinks,"Everyone needs to admit that this movie is rubbish. If you think this is good, you need to stop pretending that you are sophisticated, sensitive and artistic. Just because the plot is incomprehensible doesn't make it magical or profound. Thought provoking? No deep insights to life will spring forth but you will spend hours trying to decifer what you just saw and whether the rental price was stolen from you. Or worse the cost of buying this movie on the recommendation of your brooding local bistro who spends all his free time analyzing Jack Kerouac prose."
4,Enjoyable - BUT NOT IF YOU READ THE OTHER REVIEWS!,"Careful -- Many of these reviews are full of spoilers. The most fun thing about this movie is trying to figure out what's going on. Some of these other reviews give you the most plausible interpretation, which you would otherwise have no chance of divining until at least 3/4 of the way through the movie (personally, I didn't really figure it out until the end credits started to roll). It's just not the same experience if you know ahead of time."
1,Mulholland Drive,I'd like to shake Mr Lynch......by the neck! This film is a series of totally unconnected vignetts that really start to irritate you towards the second half of the film. You can see that he is losing his grip as the film staggers on towards the last quarter. The only thing that holds it together is the lovely use of colour throughout the film. All the shots are 50% too long. Dreams and fantasies don't make good films unless you are Andrey Tarkovsky. Disapointing.
2,how can anyone like these movies?,"This movie reminds me of the famous ""last-season-was-all-a-dream"" Dallas episode. Who wants to invest 2 hours in a movie only to find that all of the plot strands never DO connect and the excuse is, well, the whole movie was a dream and that's why nothing makes sense? A lot of other reviewers purported to like this, and I don't want to impugn their honesty, but to me it's just another case of ""the emperor has no clothes.""I give it 2 stars because the pieces were interesting for about half the movie. Oh, another ""minus"" -- the spanish language version of ""crying"" was ENDLESS>"
1,Red dot art,"If you're the sort of person who considers a single red dot on white canvas as the epitome of creativity and talent, this movie is for you. You can dissect the excruciatingly long scenes of dialogue between extraneous characters, the genius of unfocused shots, and symbolism of blue boxes and shrunken parental figures with other fans, pretentiously mocking those of us who ""don't get it."" Here's what we don't get: those 2.5 hours of our lives back."
1,YUCK!!!,"This movie was strange, perplexing, and unsatisfying. Even after reading several of the five-star reviews on this site, I still do not understand why this movie got such critical acclaim, or why it was nominated for an academy award.I rented this movie because of the rave reviews quoted on the cover, claiming that it was ""hypnotic"" ""beautiful"" and ""suspenseful"". Talk about false advertising - was I ever surprised! It was one of the worst movies I can ever remember watching. The beginning is somewhat interesting, but it quickly deteriorates into a confusing, tedious, rambling mess. I kept hoping that it would improve, but it didn't. Sitting through this film was an unpleasant experience..."
1,One Of The Worst Movies I Have Seend,Sorry to say but after watching this movie. The longer the movie went on the more my eyes wanted to shut.
4,Surprisingly Quick and very witty,"Mr. Mayle's first book in this series is an excellent debut. His year in Provence speeds by with repairs to the house, visits to the outlying countryside, visitors (welcome and otherwise), and lazy days at home. I initially worried that I'd quickly tire of the everpreseant cast of repairmen who just can't seem to get the job done - but I was pleasantly surprised. The tone stays light, the stories don't get tired OR predictable (as is wont to happen in many travel narratives) and the author keeps the story well on the characters and not just on house fittings and tile varieties. As an aside, later books in the series (i.e. Toujours Provence) get a little tired."
1,Not a dvd,The vender did not say that it wasnt a DVD. I wasted my money as I have no way to watch it!
2,Water Stain,We never used this book in class. A couple pages of the book had water damage. Other wise It was in good state.
4,"Took about 7 years to finish, once I got into it I really enjoyed it","I bought this book sometime in college (I think it was an impulse purchase because I was into travel books and this seemed interesting), read 20 pages and put it down. Fast forward years later after graduation/working/getting married I was able to get into it and finally finished the book. I think the reason I couldn't get into it before was because a) I didn't cook, b) I've never been to Provence. Having gotten into shows like Top Chef and whatever looked good on the Food Network recently, I was able to appreciate the delicious food descriptions and hunting truffle scenes in the book. Plus having visited the region, I was certainly able to appreciate the book better. So yeah, this is definitely an enjoyable read! Right now I'm listening to Mayle's ""Encore Provence"" on audio book and plan to watch the movie based on his other novel ""A Good Year."""
5,I love this book!,"What a wonderful story.... I've read it more than once. I've never been to Provence but, have always wanted to.. and I read this book again whenever I feel like going. Some parts might be confusing for someone who doesn't understand some French but that but that did not apply to me. Some parts might disgust a strict vegetarian like myself, but they didn't happen to disgust me. It's just entirely interesting, and entertaining, and you do get a good idea of the type of ""neighborhood"" (for lack of a better word)where this is all taking place. It's wonderful getting to know everyone in this story."
2,A Year in Provence seemed like 10 years in Provence,"I just could not stay interested in this book. Too much talk about what kind of wine they were drinking and what they were eating. I couldn't stay focused. It is very, very light reading. If you were planning a trip there it might be more interesting, because the descriptions of the countryside are quite nice. It just wasn't my ""cup of tea"""
5,Great Book,This book is a great summer read! I first read the book in my 20s and couldn't get into it. I read it again in my 30s and found it to be such great fun!
5,The Best English - Spanish Dictionary,"I wish they had new editions of this dictionary. Even when this edition is almost 40 years old, I still haven't found another dictionary as complete as this one. It is just the best !"
2,Live?,If you listen close you can hear the overdubs. The only thing live about this album is the applause. Workmanlike. That's the only word to describe it.
3,Maybe I overrated Hell Freezes Over,"I want to like their live performances, but they seem slow and country with some engagement of the audience...great tunes, but the shows?"
3,On The Road,"Live is just an average effort by the band. The songs are all top-notch and there are some nice surprises like ""Doolin' Dalton"", ""Saturday Night"" and a version of Joe Walsh's solo hit ""Life's Been Good"", but unfortunately the live versions are basically a paint-by-the-numbers versions of their superior studio efforts. The band are notoriously anal and perfectionists about their music, so that leaves little room for improvisation. They also did some studio touch up work on the songs to enhance their quality which takes away from the reasons why you want to hear a band live. You want to hear them in their rawest, most personal form. Live doesn't live up to expectations."
5,Eagles Live,An excellent purchase! A must have for anyone who likes the Eagles band or music from the 70's and 80's.
4,"Different styles, different sound....same band!","This album is one of my more favorite ones yet, because of the way that the solo leads are played (such as on Hotel California, Life in the Fast Lane, and Take it Easy). They differ from the way they were originally recorded, and Take it Easy didn't even have a lead in it's first recording. I like hearing the differences between the way they sing as well...they added different harmonies, changed pitches at different spots, and concocted an awesome LIVE sound! I recommend this for any real Eagles fan!"
2,Some good and not so good things.,"As a family therapist I was looking for a book for a client. I like the way this book initiates discussion and creativity, as critical aspects of the grieving process. As I read the sample pages I read a page that would not fit with a child or family who believes in life after death. I just wanted to make others aware that this book may not fit for people of faith."
4,good book,Very nice book. good for kids that are trying to work through death. Very Sweet and it helped us too
5,Wonderful,This book is a wonderful way for children to express their thoughts and feelings about dying. This book can be used before the death of a loved one. I bought two of these books for a friend whose husband is dying and they have two young children. They love the books and using art therapy has helped these children to express what they are thinking and feeling.
3,A piece of mediocrity among many good books on Thailand,"If you are going to Thailand for any length of time, the information in this book is lacking due to many biases and lack of information on various important subjects. I would recommend it only for a novice tourist with a few days in the Kingdom."
2,Ultimately unhelpful,"Though well produced and well illustrated I found this book to be disapointing. I thought it woud be more overtly rigourous in its analysis. Instead it offers only personnal insights into the structure of ordinary enironments. The back cover says that the book is the result of years of 'design research', yet I could find little evidence of this research in the book. Some people may find these insights illumating, unfortunately I did not, and without formal research to back them up I found the book disappointing."
4,Longhorn mini helmet,"The Texas Longhorns were darker than they should be. Held right next to the Texas A&M helmet, the colors look identical. Whoever prodcued the stickers, did not look at the color hue. Good gift though"
2,Doesn't fit the '05 properly,"I actually bought two of these. One for my Dad's '99 and one for my '05. It fits the '99 perfectly, but the '05 fit leaves much to be desired. It's way too loose on the '05 and will fall right out when you shut the tailgate. I'd give this product 5 stars for a 1999 model, and 1 star for a 2005. They really need to change the description since this simply isn't the correct part for those pickups."
3,Quick interesting read,"This is a fun quick book to read -- lots of interesting stories, and it adds some insight into the job of flight nurse. The author does a good job of not talking down to the reader, explaining most medical terms as the stories go along. The book is a real quick read -- glad I picked it up at the library.After the pages of portraying how professional and dedicated flight medical staff are, it was a bit jarring to read about how their week-long annual conferences are ""really nothing more than drinkfests,"" and the author thought it was a blast to get so drunk she couldn't sit through a class the next morning. Let's hope she doesn't need to use the techniques she was too drunk to learn on her next patient!I also wish the book had given a better view of the author as a person -- sometimes she writes about her feelings, but it comes across as more of a report than insight."
5,A must read for anyone in EMS...,I wish that someday I can get a signed copy from Janice Hudson. Its required reading in some nursing programs. I am a volunteer EMT and can never come close to the experiences she has endured.
3,A lot of information I already knew,"Much like the author I've battled moderate acne for many years now and out of my own frustration I've done a lot of online research myself. This book does have a lot of info in it, but if you're like me and aren't a ""newby"" with acne, you might find this book repetitive. There were a few things that I learned and found helpful however the other reviews of this book led me to believe that there was some magical information in here that would give me the power to clear my acne."
4,Very Informative,"This book is very well-written and informative. I learned so much about acne and found a few things to try on myself. After multiple trips to beauticians and dermatologists, I found a regimen that had me looking much better in a couple of weeks! I'm impressed and have shared the book with my three sisters. I wish she would have covered the role of acne in pregnancy and nursing more thoroughly; that would have been an improvement. Also, it is a little outdated on the products available, but as soon as the book was printed it was outdated, so that didn't affect the review. I feel this book is well worth the price."
4,Compelling,"This film shows an unusual ""other side"" of the Middle East problem. The media is kind of controlled and we never get to see the palestinian casualties and drama. Some unaware people even think they don't have hearts,families, children and pain. The film also suggests that when you live a desperate life and have no choices sometimes you look for desperate actions."
2,Pretty dreary; only for the Garland completist....,"This soap opera is not enlivened by the generally downbeat songs. Garland is a virtual parody of her more vigorous younger self. This is a camp spectacle, from the youthful drag performers in Gilbert and Sullivan to the jerky, hand-wringing Garland. This is the Garland that drag performers got down pat 40 years ago. The film is more artifact than entertainment. Only if you like studying Garland from beginning to end is this likely to be of interest."
3,It does work,"Black & Decker EX420-2P-D6 Ultrasonic Pest Repeller Nightlight, Medium Room (2 Pack)This product does work but you need to make sure that it has a clear view of the room and as close to the floor as possible. The main reason I like it is because I really don't have to use bug bombs in my fish tank room."
1,It does bother Cats!,"I bought this product because I have spiders in my bedroom but after I pluged it in my cats went after it. He tried to pull it out of the wall, even though the package says it does not harm cats or dogs, cats can hear it and at least mine does not like the sound."
2,"inadequate description, translation","The pleasure of Plato is as much from his literary as from his philosophical acumen. The choice of the public-domain Jowett translation is unhappy for bringing out the literary merit of the original. This Victorian prose, while usually competent as translation, does not ring true to the original and certainly does nothing for the late 20th century American ear. One wonders why the set is so expensive when the translation was had for nothing. And why doesn't Amazon print the contents of these cassettes in their bibliographical information. Does one have to buy the set to find out exactly what its contents are>"
1,no,"I found this book to be more for an american company, but still some points in it are universal. I would recomend talking to a lawyer, which you should do anyway and if they are worth anything they should be able to cover most of the ground this book does. It makes a great fire starter."
5,A must have for the business library,"My husband and I read this book from cover to cover before establishing our own corporation, and have found this book to be one of the best in this area. We have since referred to this book for guidance and understanding for taxes, payroll, to add or not to add an employee to the corporation and why incorporation works for the small two person business. I would recommend this book to any one wanting to start a busines. It is easy to read and understand, and above all -interesting."
5,One of my favorite authors!,It's been a while since I read this but I remember it being one of my favorites. I love her work and I don't understand the negative reviews either (as stated by another reviewer).
3,Interesting,"I have enjoyed this book a lot. I have learnt a lot about american wine, its history, its specificities, its wineries, its stakes...After reading this book, you have a rather accurate overview of the american wine industry.I was just not always comfortable with the very scholar format."
5,"A Brilliant Tale of Wine, History, and Innovation","This is one of the best books I've read in a long time. I loved the the history and, as a wine lover, it helped me understand the product and the industry in a way I never did before. I am a management professor at Stanford, so the best part for me was reading about the innovative practices used in the wine industry, the constant experimentation and information sharing that should serve as model for other industries. After reading this book I realized that the wine industry, not the computer industry, is the best model other firms and industries that want to flourish. I'd give this book six stars if I could."
5,Easy does it.,"California Sizzles provides excellent recipes that are devoid of the blood-sweat-and tears with which many of us are too familiar.I learned of this book at a lunch where one of the cookbook's praiseworthy recipes was served. There was almost a stunned silence when the group learned I didn't have it on my bookshelf. Well, I do now and don't regret it for a minute. American cuisine has long been extremely underrated."
5,Excellent product.,"I have owned two of the 3M 6000 respirators. They work great except for one thing, the head strap wears out before anything else. I keep having to buy entirely new respirators because I cannot find replacement head straps. This facepiece has the head strap attached, at one third of the cost of a new respirator. I switched out the charcoal filters from my old respirators, and I am in business! Great product."
2,Broken within a month of little use.....,"My husband and I bought Pooh when my son was 5 mos. At first he was scared of Pooh. Then when he did warm up to him, he treated the rattle and Pooh as two different toys. (I guess too young for the cause and effect of the toy) Pooh was very hard to understand, but my son still liked him. After a few weeks with not that much use, he broke completely!!!! What makes me upset is that poor Chicken Dance Elmo got such a low review by the editor and this piece of junk got such a good one. Yeah, Elmo is loud, maybe even annoying, but hey, my son loves him, he isn't broken yet, and you can actually understand him!!!!!!! I guess I need to pay more attention to the parents reviews and not the editor!!!!!"
2,not worth a cent.,"Sounds cool in theory but DOES NOT WORK in practice. Maybe we got a lemon, but seems like our son has to be practically on top of the Pooh with the rattle in just the right spot to get it to move. It also ""reacts"" if your child yells or cries loudly, not a habit I want my son to get into!! It also goes off at random when we're not even in the room!Bottom line - you're better off with a plain old battery-free stuffed animal for [$$$]. The rattle is ugly, but entertaining enough."
2,Not for a six month old,"I had to have this for my son before he was even born. He got it for Christmas at six months old. He was excited as he also has a Pooh that talks when you press letters on his belly. However, the rattle is too big and hard for a six month old. He also does not understand to shake the rattle to get Pooh moving and gets frustrated, so we wind up pushing the belly. Also, when my son hits himself with the rattle, it hurts. It is rock hard plastic.It is nearly impossible to understand what the doll is saying and the movements are jerky. I am wondering if something is wrong with it actually. If that is how it is supposed to sound, it's terrible."
5,Love Winnie the Pooh,"My 4yr old son wanted to get this for his 5 month old brother, He watched a commercial on this. So, we got it for his baby brother for Christmas. This is the cutiest little toy. The baby just laughs when he sees it. Pooh is cute how he shakes."
3,I got it to work,"I did get it to work, but it's still not as cool as it looks on TV, but what is? It really is cute. My main complaint is the rattle. You have to constantly shake the rattle to keep it going, which is annoying. It should run a little longer before you have to shake it again. Plus the rattle is so loud, it drowns out the music from Pooh. My son is only 4 1/2 months old, so he can't shake the rattle himself. So when I shake it for him, he ends up watching me instead of Pooh. I don't think he can even hear the music for the rattling. My husband and I haven't decided if we are keeping it or not. I still have the box. It's just so aggravating since we looked for it everywhere before we finally found it."
4,If only...,"I loved the commercial for the Shake and Rattle Pooh, so I bought it for my son. I thought the toy would be easy to use; however, it is nearly impossible for a toddler to use the toy correctly. My 11 month old son loves to dance when Pooh is turned on, but I have to squeeze his tummy before Pooh will wiggle. My son also shakes the rattle, yet can rarely get Pooh to shake, because he has to be right in front of Pooh's rattle for it to work. Yes, the idea is great, but the design flaws prevent this toy from ranking high on this Mommy's list."
2,Disappointed,I thought this toy was a great idea. Unfortunately you have to shake the rattle pretty hard to get pooh to respond. My daughter wasn't able to shake it hard enough so she never understood that shaking the rattle made pooh move. This toy now sits on a shelf untouched.
5,A concise book bursting with wisdom,"The Pocket Thomas Merton is an amazing little book featuring short and long passages by the great spiritual writer Thomas Merton. The short book, roughly 200 pages in length, offers wisdom about topics such as God, truth and love. Readers can meditate and reflect upon Merton's piercing insight and his words offer reassurance and hope. I think this serves as a great introduction to Merton's writings and the passages are collected from many of his books. While I don't agree with everything Merton says (I think there is a case for just war to be had; Merton wrote extensively about nonviolence), I think a lot of his insight is very helpful for our spiritual walk."
5,Amazing Talent Deserves More Popularity,"It appears this artist is not that well-known with the general public. My local jazz-based radio station (WDNA) does not play her music (as of today) and it is a shame, because Paulette Dozier is an excellent jazz vocalist. I first purchased her ""Over & Over Again"" CD and I liked it so much, that I went ahead and purchased this one ""With You."" --- If you like good music, by a great artist, give it a try. You won't regret it."
4,An Almost Perfect Cooler,"This cooler actually suits the design of my laptop more than any other I've used. My laptop gets hot on the left side, or at least, that's where the fan blows out all the hot air. It can get hot enough to be uncomfortable to the touch.This fan keeps the air flowing underneath the entire laptop and around the sides, which has helped a lot! No more scalding!The only problem I have is positioning it. You can't use this on your lap. It simply won't work. It's a table-top cooler only. And it's hard to keep the laptop correctly positioned. It goes behind the laptop, with the back of the laptop sitting slightly elevated on top.It would be perfect if it came with some kind of latch or hook to keep itself in place at the back of the laptop.Look at the product pictures closely, because they'll have more information on how to use it than anything shipped to you.Over all, it works great. I wish there were more coolers that worked like this. The others I've used didn't do the trick."
4,One of the best dance albums of the century.,"I read the other reviews and i'm suprised that ""Felicidad"" is not among the favorite songs. I personally think that that's the best track on the album. The group sounds wonderful...it's like a mixture of ABBA and Barry White..just incredible."
5,A Wonderful Christmas Album,"I heard Mary's Boy Child on the radio and called the station for the artist name, then I could not find it anywhere in the city...This was the hit of our family's Christmas! It is the only album we played all day and evening and had so much fun singing and dancing to it's catchy music. Anything from line dancing to cha-chas worked and all the grandchildren learned to dance...toooo much fun!"
5,Id rate it ten stars if could!,"Last year, I had never even heard the name ""Insane Clown Posse"". And then a freind let me listen to the ""Great Melinko's Neden Game"". So then I went to the record store to find ""TGM"" and stumbled over The Riddle Box. From that day on I have been under a trance by there pleasingly wicked sound and sick humor. So as I wait for there next Cd to come out I can easily say that they are at their best in the Riddle Box."
4,buy me now,i haven`t found any ICP stuff that i didn`t like-but thats me-i could think of a lot of things to waste money on-this a`int one of them.BUY BUY BUY!MCL>Alan
5,Great Product,Was very easy to paint. Seems to be very durable. Looks amazing when completed. The stickers that come with is really make it look nice.
4,Great Map and Great Resource,"I purchased this map based on the London version ... and it didn't disappoint. If you need a solid lay of the land (hotels, emergency numbers, resturants, et al) with a transportation and street map this is a great buy. However, if you are thinking about using the map for driving .... not a good look (as mentioned the map will omit smaller streets) or if you want to go to the outer arrondissements (neighborhoods) then you will want a more robust guide book."
4,K&N 33-2705 High Perf Air Filter for my 1994 E320 Benz,"I can't exactly tell, how much performance boost I got after installing this filter, since I don't have any pre-install numbers to work with. So if your deciding factor is based on how much performance you will gain after installing this filter, my review isn't going to help. All I can say that it fits perfectly in my 94 E320 Sedan, It looks pretty solid/good and it's priced right. My main reason for buying this filter was the fact that it can be resued over and over up to one million miles (according to K&N), which is a lot of miles :-). So if you are trying to save money and don't want to loose performance, this is the filter for you."
2,Good for colds or occasional use only,"I used to use these humidifiers every night, and they do put out a lot of nice warm moisture- but they are a pain to fill, a pain to clean, and with my water I have to add salt. After a while the output goes down and it starts to bubble/overboil and spit. Don't use this for an everyday humidifier, I never would for everyday, but I would spend the 12 bucks to get one for a week or two's use if I got sick. I do not know if a cool mist humidifier like the one I just bought would do so well for a cold.The Vicks models are cheap to buy and cheaply made...not for long term or heavy duty use."
4,Six years.,"Bought this in 2007 and used it several times a year. Just finally died on me. To be fair, I did a very poor job of regularly cleaning and maintaining it, so I'm surprised that it lasted as long as it did! Definitely worth the price. It is noisy, but that never bothered us (we're not really noise-sensitive sleepers, though)."
4,Great relief,"My kid could not breath in nights because of severe cough and congestion. So I brought this along with Vicks vapo-liquid as I thought that would be better option over KAZ.That night she slept very well and I used it for a week, that also reduced her cough.It throws good amount of moisture in room and vicks vapours clears the blocked nostrils for easy breathing.I will recommend this product.You might need to add salt as per your water hardness for better steaming."
3,Noticeable beginings,"3 1/2Besides for a few vocal missteps, this is a solid if not spectacular latin tinged Jazz piano debut, with plenty of wonderfull moments arguing for future investment."
1,Don't waste your money,I bought this camera and printer dock only to find the software and other components are difficult to use. I ended up purchasing a new computer thinking maybe my computer was getting out dated and still with a brand new state of the art system it is still not working properly. Also the pictures are not clear when printed
1,Mac's camera,I inserted batteries and took four pictures. The camera would no longer work. I went to the battery store and bought new batteries specifically for a digital camera. It would still not even turn on.
5,For adults and children alike,"This is a classic book I have never read until now. The wonderfully boisterous Carr family is a delight. Their father, Dr Carr, knows how to bring children up with freedom and love. His sister tries her best to instill discipline but it is an uphill battle. When Katy gets injured she rails against being confined. But gradually there is a change in her attitude and her relationships with the other children and her father and aunt change also. It was an absolute delight to read, and not just for children. Highly recommended"
2,BioPro Anti-Radiation Chip,"This product has BioPro's first technology. Not that is will not work but I would suggest that one look at alternatives. The new product on the street both via Multiline Marketing and direct merchandising is scalar energy. Scalar Energy looks like the science of tomorrow and gets away from the SRT and MRT so to speak technology. Google Scalar Energy and read the science not the MLM's advertising. The BarronReport from 2001 and any article you can get about Nikole Tesla, the discover of Scalar Energy. A Scalar Energy pendant will emit longitudinal energy 1.75 feet out from the body. I would recommend this first and the fon chip after."
2,not quite what I expected,"These were half the size I thought they would be... they are worth every penny spent on them, but not much more than that. They are filled with a green grit substance used to add weight to them. It seems to break apart pretty easily, I took all of it out and zip tied them to other aquarium ornameants"
1,"dumb (me), and dumber (this device)","ARGGHH I feel like such a idiot. I fell for it and thought it would work. If only HOPE were enough to drive the bugs out. I bet all the big companies would try to bottle hope and sell it, it would work just as well as this thing! I have 5 all going in my >700sq ft condo. I've seen bugs crawling right ON it. Centipedes (Scolopendra heros) within feet of it. And what the hell!? Aren't centipedes from the jungle or somthing? I can't believe it. I oughta sue, false advertising! They shouldn't get away with it because I need my $30 bucks back more than they do, I guarantee it! Black and Decker can make wimpy hand drills somewhat well, and NOTHING MORE. ARRGGHHH!!!"
2,Drove my dog nuts...,"It said it wasn't supposed to affect dogs or cats, but within a few days of plugging this thing in my dog would not go into our kitchen to eat or drink. She literally didn't eat for days. She started whining constantly. We thought she was sick! But this morning, I had an a-ha moment and saw that thing in our kitchen. As soon as I unplugged that pest repeller, she stopped whining. I expect an empty food bowl when I get home. So I'm sure this thing works on small pests, given what it did to my 50 lb dog. But I do not recommend if you have pets."
3,I use it in conjunction with peppermint oil. Sleep pattern affected.,"I use this in conjunction with peppermint oil, all over the house, specially in the basement. My dogs have not been affected so far, but I have noticed that my sleep pattern has been interrupted since using this gadget. Has anybody experienced the same?"
1,This product is 100% RIP OFF; DOES NOT WORK AT ALL!,Title of my review says it all. These things are a complete waste of money; falsely advertised pieces of junk!
1,Don't waste your money!,"I installed 6 of these things throughout my small 2 bedroom house. Not only have the number of ants not gone down, I think they've increased. It's like an ant nightclub here, the ants are doing a conga line through the house! A complete waste of money!"
4,"""AIR DRYER """,Received the product took it right to the basement and it has been working just fine ever since .Can't comment on the long term but it is off to a good start. Good buy for the $$$.
4,Works great!,"This dehumidifier works great. The thing I like best is that it works in a much colder temperature than my old one. No freezing up is a big plus! The reason I gave it four out of five stars is due to the noise factor. It is not what you would call a quiet running machine, but it is in the basement so the noise is not really a problem. It does what I need it to do, which is to take moisture out of the air."
1,Lasted only 1 season,"This unit worked fine for about a year. Second summer season it ceased to remove humidity from the air. May be an isolated incident, but can't recommend it."
4,great value; gets the work done,"My product is only weeks old but works just fine. I am a fairly weak female and can remove and empty the water with ease. Once the container is full, there is still plenty of room so spilling while emptying is avoided. I like that the unit is pretty quiet in comparisson, since i live in the basement where I use it. I would give it five stars but the unit is on wheels (great though for easy transfer) and because of that, if i tap or bump it on accident it stops working for a few seconds, regroups, and starts again. I like the automatic shut off feature."
1,Boring adventure,I have been reading many travel/adventure stories lately. This one is taking me forever to finish. The title says 3 years in a 12 foot boat. I dont think he spent that much time on it at all.I found this book not to be very interesting to me. I loved Don Starkells book about his trip.
3,Adequate,"This is the second one of these that I have purchased. I learned to take of it properly by not leaving it in the pool overnight and storing it properly over the winter otherwise it will get ruined. Also the fold out leg rest will tear away fairly easily from the rest of the chair if not treated carefully. I have already had to sew mine back on after a large male friend used it. I like to set in it to read in the pool and this, so far, has been the best float for the price for doing that."
2,Very small.,I was not to happy with the little plant. It arrived very dry and half dead and was just a tiny little twig. I expected at least a small plant that would be alittle stronger. The plant I recieved was about maybe 3 inches high and very few leaves. For a plant that is supposed to grow into a large plant if it lives it will take a loooooong time before it could be considered a large plant.
3,You Can't Turn Back The Clock...,"Rocky V, the fifth series of Rocky series, in 1990, ended up proving that you can't get back the gist of what the earlier Rocky series had.The street of Philadelphia where Rocky was born and bred still is there. However, the time has changed that much even the same place looks different. Rocky Balboa donning his favorite hat when he was the unknown fighter in Philadelphia looks a bit out of place. The storyline is shaky as Rocky Balboa the retired former champion might have been like. He meets a young man and teaches everything he had to the Tommy Gunn. After Tommy betrays Rocky, there will be an unexpected street-fighting scene that caused uproar from Rocky fans. I can have no clues to what the coming Rocky movie will be like. I give this movie three stars because of nostalgia you can find from this movie particularly ol' Micky. (He surely got old)."
1,Just Cause I Had the Rest,Easily the worst of the Rocky movies. Only got it cause I needed to fill the space on my shelf between IV and Balboa.
2,Good movie but Rocky doesn't fight much in this!,It's just about Rocky retiring from boxing and he helps his son become a streetfighter to protect himself from bullies at school. What's interesting about this movie is that Sylvestor Stallone's son Sage Stallone appears in this and the character he plays is Rocky's son also. Rocky also helps this guy fights but this movie doesn't get exciting till the end. It's still a good movie just not exciting as the others. I think Rocky IV is the best of the series and also has a good soundtrack to workout with.
2,Please don't put us through de mille again!,"The first in the series of these films was a cinematic blockbuster; but unfortunately, it was all downhill after that. This film is undoubtedly the worst of the set in all aspects. A poor screenplay along with atrocious acting debuts from sportswriters and television personalities from the local Philadelphia area would make just about anyone request a refund for this video. I find it hard to believe that a Rocky VI is actually in production right now!"
2,Buy it if you have to !,Too much information for a first year level and this can be dangerous in the hands of an inexperienced teacher. Much of the anatomical detail is more suited to first year Med school. It looks like modern graphics and cut and past has resulted in info overload. Personally I found it a poor read I didn't enjoy her chatty style. Again this is a dangerous weapon in the wrong hands !
3,"Yes, but...","This book is an outstanding achievement for a single author, and I have learned a great deal from it. I like the graphics, the layout, and the wealth of information. However, I do find many paragraphs and passages in this book difficult to follow, usually because crucial details are missing. See, for example the explanations of ossification (pages 181-183) and the countercurrent mechanism in the kidneys (pages 1022-1026). It took me less time to digest a whole book on the immune system than the corresponding chapter in this book (chapter 22).There is a web site associated with the book, which gives the student an opportunity to ask questions. I submitted a couple of simple questions several weeks ago, but have yet to receive a reply.Unfortunately, I don't know of any A & P book at this level that would be better."
2,Disappointment,"I bought this product for my 4 year old niece. Everything but the bracelet, necklace, and wings fell apart. The wand and headband/crown broke within 5 minutes without hard play. Glue was visible on the headband/crown. The wings did not break but did sit right on the back-they hung sideways. The elastic was stretched out within an hour from taking it off and putting it back on repeatedly. The plastic shoes also cracked and eventually broke to the point where they were no longer wearable. The idea of the outfit is very cute but the quality is very poor. My niece's birthday present was ruined within an hour."
3,Be Warned!,"I have been collecting all of the Boxed Sets of Naruto and Naruto Shippuden up till now. The design of this box has been altered. It is no longer three separate slim cases in the cardboard box. This box looks different and is self contained. I haven't opened it yet to see exactly what it looks like inside, since I am annoyed that it looks different then all of the other box sets on my shelf, but I have as of yet been unable to find someone selling one like the the others, so my guess is it has been discontinued. If anyone has information on the subject, let me know! :("
4,Pretty good!,Item came and quality was as good as I expected it to be. I used it once to clean my chimney and worked great. For this price I would recommend you get it.
5,This Book is Worth It's Weight in Gold!,"As a low carb dieter who has only successfully lost weight with this type of plan (13 pounds/8.5"" since June of this year), I'd like to congratulate Fran for an absolutely great book. The best parts in it are the hints she gives for handling cravings, emergency techniques and supplementation advice from one who has been through it, I could not believe all the helpful tidbits she offers fellow low carbers!! Also the receipes!!!!!! I am personally proud of Fran for her weight loss to date, and her courage to write and share of her personal experiences, especially since she is still on her journey. She is a REAL person, like most of us, and willing to share things that might work with the rest of us! I am so glad to have this book to help me as I continue eating low carb, it will certainly make the road a lot less bumpy!"
2,Bad English Dub,This is such a good story but Yuki's voice was beyond annoying- Why did they let Yuki's English voice come off as some stale emo character? Her inner monologues are so painful to hear I will never watch this again. The voice actress does well in situations that require stoic emotion (like Ein in Phantom) and that is not Yuki. I'll stick with the manga on this story.
3,A bit disappointed,The collection...it's missing a collection! It's missing Volume 2. The dvd package only has Volume 1 & 3. Come on Viz!
4,Great travel bag,"We have twins, so we have to lug two car seats around. This bag really helped. We were able to link it around our stroller handle, which made cruising through the airport fairly easy. When my husband had to carry it, he wished the strap was a little bit padded, but he said it wasn't too bad (hence the four stars). Overall, it made our trip easier, and protected our car seats, which was also important. If you travel on planes even twice a year, it's well worth the investment."
4,Love this bag!,"We bought this bag to protect our Evenflo Triumph car seat on our first flight with all the baby equipment. I had seen people check their car seats in garbage bags before, but wanted the car seat to be protected. The car seat fit in easily with plenty of room to spare. We packed my son's clothes for a week in the bag too. The straps are a little awkward, but we were able to get everything checked in OK. The bag still looks brand new after our trip! We had a total of 4 different flights. There will be room to add a booster seat in the same bag when baby #2 comes along. I know we will get a ton of use from this bag in the years to come!"
4,Works Great!,"We bought the carrier to use on our first airplane trip with our daughter. It had tons of room! We should have practiced first - instead, we were trying to figure out which way the car seat fit in the bag in the dark at the airport. But once we got that figured out, there was still room for a blanket, 3 winter coats, and excess toys, etc. of our daughter's. It would be nice if the bag has wheels, as it's a little cumbersome as a duffle bag - but that's what Dad's are for! The fabric is very sturdy and there is a small zippered pouch on the outside to put the strap in when checking the bag."
4,Very necessary,"I just purchased and used this carseat travel bag and I have to say that I couldn't have gotten along without it. The material is fairly durable considering all that the airlines put luggage through and even though the bag came out a ""little"" beat up, I would hate to see what the carseat would look like without it!Eddie Baur did a great job of giving you plenty of room, because I was able to stuff a pack of diapers, container of formula, blankets and some extra shoes along with the carseat in this travel bag. The one downside was that for such a heavy, odd-shaped piece of luggage the shoulder strap did not help at all. Thank goodness there was also a handle to hold onto, otherwise I would not have gotten the bag very far. All in all this prouct was a great purchase and I would higly recommend it to all."
4,great investment,"It was a bit bulky but as I was traveling internationally, it helped with switching planes and cruising across airports during holiday travel. I also bought a folding cart, $14.00 at Walmart, that seemes to help with the load. One of the nice things about this is I could put my jackets in it as well and not have to put them in my carry on. The bag folds up and stores easily too. All in all I say it's a great product. Better than hauling the car seat around on it's own."
3,good but not for Checked Luggage,"I bought this bag to carry our Britax carseat to Texas. We wrapped it with two wool blankets and then put it in this bag. When we got home, a structural component of the seat broke, rendering it useless and forcing me to buy another seat(GRRR). This bag would be good however, if you used the seat as one of your carry-ons. The Britax seats are quite large but this one still had enough room for extra diapers.I only gave it 3 stars because my seat got destroyed. I would still buy it again but only use it for a carry-on."
5,Wonderfully Awful,"Yes, there may be something wrong with me, but I love bad movies. The more times you see the crew in the shot the better. We bought this movie at the local supermarket last night and I have never laughed so hard in my life. The music is pure cheese, the plot is hysterical, the acting is downright scary. I even checked it out on imdb and all the actors had to be the director's friends, because they have not acted in anything since 1984 when the movie came out. This movie + alcohol + friends = a fabulous time!"
4,Good book to get your feet wet.,"If you have never used CF before this is a good book to get you started. Each days lessons are clear and concise, removing any ambiguity other books may create. The end of chapter summaries make a nice review tool allowing you to test your memory about what you have learned. This is probably why Ben Forta endorses this book. Charles Mohnike has filled a niche that seems to be lacking in other books. This is truly a beginners book.While being a good beginner's lesson book, I would not use it as a day-to-day reference book. This is where both of Ben Forta's books shine. I bought this book for one of the members in my team and once he finished with it, it was placed on the bookshelf and ignored. Everyone prefers to use Ben Forta's books as their reference material.As new team members come aboard we give them this book to teach them CF, so we are able to recycle its use continually."
1,Pathetic Product,See comments for for Gables to GO item #27811. Same issue. Unhooking it from a port requires tremendous effort almost damaging the host port.
3,An OK book,This is more like a booklet. Covers the common basics you can get from your pediatrician.
1,A fabrication,"People who are thinking of purchasing this book should know that it is a fabrication. The last loads of letters from Stalingrad were in fact confiscated by the Nazi regime for analysis and never delivered to their intended recipients, but they were subsequently destroyed on Goebbels's order. Only a few extracts copied out by the analysts survived, and they were not incorporated into this book. Of course, the Soviets captured significant numbers of ""last letters"" in the course of liquidating the Stalingrad pocket (both from downed aircraft and from the captured German soldiers themselves) but none of those letters were available to the public when this book was published."
4,nice book,"I find it nice and effective in terms of building communication skills, actually it is required text book for my current semester but I liked it not just for that reason. in particular its CD can help you hear the conversations and different strategies of building communication. Also it is can be hear in the car while you driving or in your CD player. In short I can say that it can have it's good affect for ESL students"
3,Cute book if you're looking to waste 10 minutes,"It was mildly interesting, moderately amusing and it took 10 minutes to read from cover to cover. Is it worth buying? Sure, if you get it for a few dollars and you collect Zen books. Is it really Zen? Not as I understand it but then Zen is what you make it so YMMV."
3,playmobil farm,We found that the buildings came apart and had to be put back together when ever we played with it. There were lots of little pieces with this too.Also it was time consuming to put it together when we pulled it out of the box. It would of been nicer if some of the pieces already were together.All in all we liked the idea of a farm and animals to play with. Next time I might go with a nice wooded farm set.
5,Mark leaves The House.....,"If you've read 'House of Leaves' you'll know just how good this author is - he's up there with Pynchon, Rushdie, Eco, DeLillo et al.If you're expecting another 'House of Leaves' this isn't. It's more of an epic poem. Think Milton's 'Paradise Lost' with 'Heaven or Las Vegas' by the Cocteau Twins playing on your iPod and you're on the right track...At first it's frustrating, by the end it's a thing of rare beauty. Ignore the timeline of history and let it soak in...I haven't read 'Against the Day' yet but this just may be Book of the Year.Stunning..."
5,Challenging and rewarding.,"Danielewski, after the excellent but flawed 'House of Leaves', gives us the greatest apocalyptic novel (though, as many critics have pointed out, it's more of an epic poem than anything else) since Pynchon's 'Gravity's Rainbow'. The verbal pyrotechnics may irritate at first, especially the Whitmanesque, over-whimsical vocabulary (which had me gritting my teeth initially), but once you clear the first few 'episodes' (and the recommended reading method does help ease you into the style) it's easy to become hooked, and ultimately it becomes clear that it really couldn't have been written any other way. Sam and Hailey's enthusiasm for each other and for their ultimately doomed voyage is undeniably contagious. The finale is breathtakingly beautiful and terrible - heartbreaking, yet ultimately optimistic. Despite the frequent carnage of the central road trip and the historical events it mirrors, this is a highly life-affirming read."
1,Contrived and Annoying,"Hallelujah! Jalepeno!Contretemps.I, too, can walk away from anything.Especially something as annoying as this pretentious barf of a book.I took the publisher's advice and read eight pages of Sam's story, then turned the book over and read eight pages of Hailey's story; then I closed the book, resenting the ten or so minutes wasted on this insult to writing and returned it to the library, thankful that I hadn't actually bought it.Let others call this farce a literary breakthrough, proclaim it brilliant or a masterpiece. I'm not afraid to say ""The Emperor has no clothes!"""
1,If only Typography could substitute for characters and story,"It doesn't take talent or smarts to arrange letters and typography into a lifeless mobius strip without story or characterization. I can't believe anybody really has a satisfying experience reading this kind of empty posturing. Supremely dolled-up, shallow tripe."
1,consistently inaccurate,"I tried several times to use this thermometer, using the instructions each time. The temperature reading was consistently low by about three degrees F. I've been tracking my basal body temperature for over a year, so I know what my temp should be.... and it's certainly not in the 95 degree range!"
3,Good Overview,"This is a nice book for a person to get a good overview of iterative methods. The detail is often lacking, however the book is a good introduction to the field. The authors are some of the biggest names in the field and the book shows some insight into the theory and application of iterative methods."
1,PIECE OF JUNK! Do NOT Buy!,"The water sound is very mild unless you put your head right up to it and I have good hearing! I read a review about keeping it clean to avoid motor noise which I did but 2 months later, forget it. Clean clean clean and it rumbles rumble rumbles. After the first week the top light went out and I did not return it.(Dumb) Now the tiny motor is unbearable and when you keep it as full as they say, it makes a mess all over so you need to leave a towel on the floor if they are wood. It is plastic and cheap and the water sound was never great but after 2 months it is unusable. I wouldn't even pawn this off at a yard sale and now I am stuck with it. Beware people...you do get what you pay for! Find a good fountain company that stands behind its products beyond 30 days! You have been warned so dont throw your money away on this!"
1,Cheap and no sound but the pump!,"This product is very cheap. It is made of cheap plastic...don't be fooled by the picture. No matter how you arrange the rocks, you can't make the water sound nearly loud enough to overcome the pump noise. The pump isn't that loud, making it even more surprising that the water noise can't cover it. I took it back!"
1,Cheap,"I bought this at Walmart - it is cheap looking and plastic, not as nice as it looks on the box. It quit working after a few weeks."
3,Not bad for the price,"Like other reviews, I agree there are not enough rocks. It does splash a little so I keep it on a map. It's okay for the price, this is the first fountain I have purchased so I wasn't sure what to expect. I think I will get some enjoyment out of it but in the end, you get what you pay for."
1,Not worth a dime...,"This fountain not only is made out of cheap plastic, but the pump broke after 1 month. I do not recommend it."
1,Big Disappointment,"Purchased this fountain as a 2nd tabletop fountain for my house. All plastic, noisy, not enough rocks to cover the platform--total disappointment! I could barely hear the water over the noisy pump. My first fountain (Homedics-same brand) works lovely. It's the Zen Fountain (actually made of stone and < $20), so I thought I would be pleased with this one. Going back to get my $30 for this piece and purchase a quality item."
3,Looks nice but no water sound,I bought this fountain because I like the sound of running water. After setting it up I noticed that I heard the pump running but no water sounds. That's too bad as I thought the fountain was pretty. I don't think it was the pump itself that was loud but when attached to the cover of the fountain it started the cover vibrating. That's what makes the noise on the fountain I had. I liked the looks of it but since there was no water trickling sounds I returned it.
3,Fountain,"This is all plastic. Very few rocks supplied, I've purchased more to add to it. The trickle of water is very relaxing and has added that little bit of humidity to the room that was required. Love the light."
3,"an ""okay"" gay history","Spencer is trying to write a history of homosexuality that is not philosophical like Foucault's opus. He traces what I would call gayness from the BC era to the present day. This would be a good book for those unfamiliar with gay history. However, this book felt Eurocentric to me; he mentions little about well-researched areas of same-sex love in Asia or Native America. Also, Spencer's work is cursory; other authors have gone into depth in many of his topic areas. I liked Neil Miller's book on gay and lesbian history since the invention of the word ""homosexuality"" in the mid-1800s better than this book. This book is also male focused and may rub lesbian and bisexual women the wrong way. Still, for first-time readers of gay studies, this may be a good, initial, comprehensive book."
2,Book review,"I thought upon purchasing this book that it would be a little different. This was not the book I was searching for, but it was an okay read."
1,Guru 7.0 Street Scriptures,"I was given this cd by a mate who got it on promo as he did an interview with guru before his gig.. Ive been a huge fan of Gangstarr/Guru since the start and i must say this album was absolutely dissapointing as much as Baldhead Slick. I am so glad i didn't end up purchasing this album as its a waste of money. The only tune i like on this album was Surviving the Game and the only reason was its got the same instrumental that ""Whitelines, GMF and Furious 5"" sampled from. I don't know why Guru decided to go this way but he deffinitly took the wrong course. He should of stuck with Premier....."
1,I am very disappointed!,"I came to Amazon and saw the reviews. I did not believe what I read. I could not believe Guru turned gangsta rap! The Street Scriptures is as lousy as people wrote about it. This is so sad, because his previous CD's were beautiful blends of hip hop and jazz. Well, that's it. Unless he goes back to hip hop / jazz, I wont buy his music again. I wonder why he changed? I fell bad for the jazz artists he featured in the 1st three CDs. I am sure they too are surprised of Guru's bizzare change."
2,I am so dissillusioned right now,"This cd is sooooo awful. It's worse than the Baldhead Slick & the Click CD (which is terrible in its own right). I love the first five gang starr albums, and even the Full Clip collection's new tracks were true to the conscious style, but ever since the third jazzmatazz album came out, Guru's been gradually becoming the substance-less, gun-toting, and generally lazy lyricist I heard rapping on this album. The Ownerz and Jazzmatazz 3 had there moments, but other than that it's been garbage. Do yourself a favor and listen to the first two jazmatazz albums, No More Mr. Nice Guy, Step In The Arena, Daily Operation, and especially Hard to Earn and Moment Of Truth if you want to hear the best of Guru & Gang Starr. But stay away from this CD completely. It's so f*&^%ing awful, seriously."
4,My kids LOVE this movie,"I admit, I don't really understand the appeal but my kids LOVE this movie and my husband does as well! I have watched it with them and there's nothing inappropriate or questionable in it so it gets my approval."
3,No pigs,"This is a cute video, but my 5 y/o wanted this specifically for the pigs on the cover. We were all disappointed to find that the pigs aren't in this episode at all, contrary to both the cover and cover description. The Wallace and Grommit shorts (Wrong Trousers, A Fine Day Out, Close Shave) are perfect for the whole family, but the Shauns and their nonverbal slapstick humor appeal more to my children, not so much the parents. If this is your first Shaun, go for Off the Baa rather than this one."
5,Great gift,My 2 and 4 year olds love this set! They'll even drink plain water without complaint because they get to pour their own. Perfect for use at a little outdoor picnic.
1,too old,too old like to know the song titles on the back of all dvd orders. When the back is not show3n and readable (more than likely) you would not like the dvd. i dislike 20 % of the dvd's i purchase.
2,"1 star for scenery, 1 for the laughs","I got out of the theater laughing. This movie was hilliarious when it didnt try to be. It was that bad.STORY: People get stuck in a cave. They are being killed by monsters. Nothing really new there.CGI EFFECTS: REALLY BAD! The monsters looked really fake, and when they attacked someone, the camera shook so fast I couldnt see what was going on. Nice.ACTING: BAD! Really, its funny to hear them speak, because its just funny how bad the acting was.SCENERY: Really nice. These people knew how to make some scenerey. Too bad they couldnt figure out how to make a good movie.OVERALL: See this at your own risk. But, if you like laughing at the bad acting, waste your money and see this!"
1,are you high?,"one guy said ""This movie is designed to thrill the sci-fi/suspense/horror audience"" Phfft, I would rather have the skin ripped of my face with a pitchfork than sit through this film again. It was painfully boring and uninteresting. It had lack of character development as well as a trite story line. You will stop caring in 15 min what happens next, trust me! I hope all the people that made this movie get stuck in the cave!"
3,Mutant horror movie,"Overall I enjoyed this film, though my reason for picking it up had to do with three of the actors, all of whom interest me variously. Lena Headey, Piper Perabo and Eddie Cibrian have all made interesting films in the past, and I liked seeing them here. The film is okay, though I do find some of the action sequences a bit hard to follow, due to the quick pace and the unwillingness to show the creature effects in super close detail. Perabo needed to do a bit more, she is such a fascinating actor with a very photogenic face. But what do you expect for a DVD that costs, what, a penny? How can you go wrong?"
3,The Dark in The Carpathains,"After a famous European scientist discovers a medieval cave deep in the Carpathian Mountains which promises to yield exciting new evidence of unusual underwater life forms, he sends for a team of scuba experts played by Cole Hauser and Eddie Cibrian. They in turn assemble their experienced teams who also happen to be expert climbers and spelunkers. Reaching the area, they begin exploring the dark depths and soon become prey to carnivorous creatures which date back to the Crusades. Although there is much to be said for the action oriented film, lacking is the sympathetic cohesion which allows audiences to identify with any particular character. Still the underwater drama and some rather terrifying moments in the underground labyrinth makes for an enjoyable movie. ***"
1,lousy,if you are into watching flashlights in a cave and the odd 1/2 second on seeing something???? flashing on the screen you will enjoy this movie - if not stay away - we turned it off after about 30 minutes because you had no idea what was going on
4,Whats all the negativity about?,"This movie is designed to thrill the sci-fi/suspense/horror audience and thats exactly what it does.I absolutely loved it and I don't see why so many of you give it bad reviews because this is a damn good movie,with excellent underwater scenery.You can't possibly compare ""The Cave""to ""Pitch Black""because it has aliens not demonic looking creatures.See the movie and judge for yourself!"
2,Nothing new here in a terrible monster show!,"I cannot believe movies like this are continally made with bad acting, cheap affects, and terrible plots. This movie is very perdictable and is an offshoot from the great Alien movies--even the creatures in this movie look like the same ones in Alien. The movie is very dark and has an ending that can mean only one thing--a sequel!!! I hope not. Leave it alone-stop here please! Do not buy this crap--rent it and find out yourself if you can last thru the whole movie--smells of remakes all thru it."
3,Ok if a bit mindless.,"I would agree with much of what others have already written. The sets are terrific. The acting is OK - after all the actors are really just doing what the director tells them to do. The problem with the film is that if you start actually thinking while watching it, then it falls apart. There are far too many instances of Hollywood-heroics (something that some writer, or director thinks will look good from a cinematic perspective but which actually make no sense at all). The story line has been done many times - a monster(s) eating up a small group of people who try desperately to escape that fate. It's a theme that allows of almost endless variations and I have no quibble with that. But if you're looking for great originality this is not the movie for you. Take it for what it is - late night escapist fare - and settle back with a big bowl of homemade popcorn. Don't think too hard and it's kind of a fun ride."
3,Cool Creature!,"Great creatures, but you don't see them until far into the film. Most of today's movies are like that - slow to build up to the interesting part which, in this case, are the monsters. The premise is good and the acting is serious.Kinda reminds me of Gargoyles........but in the water!"
3,Fair Sci-Fi/Horror,"This was a fairly good horror/Sci-Fi. It had some creative scenes and was interesting as far as monster/legend/history, etc. I prefer more suspense and less blood, but you take your chances when you choose to watch this type of movie. Like many modern movies, it leaves room at the end for a sequel.Chrissy K. McVay - Author"
3,This is a perfectly good movie!,"I don't know why this movie didn't go over so well with some of the reviewers but, for the type of movie it is, it's a perfectly good one! It might not be Oscar worthy, but it's full of action and suspense, good acting, some beautiful scenery... and scary monsters. It's a decent movie worth watching if you like scary sci-fi. I look forward to someday watching The Cave 2."
5,Awesome,"This movie is awesome. I love science fiction and this movie has it all. Suspense, drama, action, great special effects. I don't know what the critics are talking about, but then they never do. If you like Avatar, Star Wars, Lord of the Rings, you will like this movie."
1,Should have been 30 minutes long. . . . would have been better.,"Why? Because this movie was missing one of the main key components of film: character developement. There was none whatsoever. This is key in thillers in order to make the viewer actually care that the characters are in danger. Even by the end of the film, everyone was a stranger to me. I could care less that they died and eventually was rooting for the genetic freaks to win so the movie would just end already.I rented this expecting a claustrophobic Pitch Black, which would have made me extremely happy. Instead all I got was a waste of three dollars.Cole Hauser cannot even save this steaming pile. Save your money and move on. . . ."
2,"Good, but left me very disappointed","I got this book through interlibrary loan at my public library, and I was very excited to read it, since I have recently become quite interested in arcane symbolism. I understood Ovason was an expert in the field, so I had quite high expectations for this book . . . and unfortunately, it just didn't meet them.Though he made some neat points here and there, his writing style was generally bland and uninviting. The majority of the symbolic interpretations seemed forced and mundane, at best. And like another reviewer pointed out: the more I read, the more I couldn't shake the feeling that this may have been done on purpose, as if to divert people's attention from the real, deeper meanings behind the symbolism. I would certainly encourage people to read it for themselves and reach their own conclusions. After all, it was not a bad book. It just left me very disappointed."
5,The Masonic Dollar Bill,If you would like to learn about the secret symbols of the dollar bill in an easy to read format then this is a great book to own.The author explains the origins of the $ symbol.The author explains the origins of the Great Seal (which is on the dollar bill).The author explains the numerology behind the dollar bill's symbols.
5,The best mascara on the market!,"Yes, it's expensive but it is a quality product. I've tried many other mascara's out there and this is the absolute best!"
2,Too Little,"It's OK if it's the only movie you have access to and want to get a glimpse of what Sturgis is all about.Too little time spent on the bikes and the riding, too much time spent on the racing and night life. I love night life but this was supposed to be a movie about bikes and riding (or so I thought.)This is a low budget, low quality, and boring movie."
3,Ab review,I thought it was a good basic workout. There was nothing special or unusual in it. It was not a video that wowed me but it was okay. I didn't find it to be difficult but fine for a beginner basic workout.
4,Another Great Whit Stillman Picture,"Here's a great offering from Whit Stillman, saw it the other night and quite enjoyed it. It is viewed not so much as a film, but rather as a snapshop of the characters' lives. The dialogue seems more like the normal conversations spoken by ordinary folks, than merely words read from a script. The plot of the film involves a Naval officer and his cousin, and the problems that they as Americans deal with in Barcelona, Spain towards the end of the Cold War. There are unfaithful women that the cousins become involved with, as well as irritating journalists bent on smearing America at every chance. The humorous banter that is traded by the two cousins is certainly an amusing sight (or is it sound?). Anyway, this film is great. Hopefully it'll be released on DVD at some point, but until then we'll have to settle for VHS. If you enjoyed The Last Days of Disco, then Barcelona is certainly for you."
2,"A vapid, boring trifle. Skip it!","The dazzling city of Barcelona is wasted on this cinematic geegaw with a microscopic plot and silly dialogue. What little substance there is revolves around two twentysomething cousins who pursue romantic free-and-easies around the city, one taking the pursuits in stride while the other suffers supposed religious qualms, Bible in hand, while dancing to Glenn Miller tunes. The picture's saving grace is the backdrop of the Catalonian cityscape, lovingly photographed and at once taken in both broadly and in small detail by the camera. But this considerable virtue is offset by an hour and a half of stock characters who, but for occasional sweet moments of language misunderstanding and girlish loveliness, have little to nothing to tell us about human nature. If you rent it -- don't buy -- for the scenery of the first half hour, and then skip the rest, you'll have gotten your money's worth."
5,"Wonderful long lasting fragrances, good for a woman, too","I have been purchasing Attar Bazaar perfume oils for years. I have purchased them at Whole Foods (not carried at most stores any longer) and purchased them from their website. I consistently receive compliments when I wear these fragrances. I usually mix them. The recommended way to wear them is to put a drop in your hands, rub them together, and then lightly stroke your palms on your hair.The Amazon price is excellent, and the delivery time very quick.They tend not to cause migraines to the wearer or others as some other scents do.Nour is another favorite fragrance of mine, did not come in this attractively presented gift box. I may purchase it separately.These scents do not smell at all masculine - it's not like wearing men's cologne or aftershave.I am very feminine and they suit me well."
3,Good but not for babyfood making!,I like this food processor and have used it for many years. Now I have a baby and tried to make babyfood with it and it did not go well. The consistency was too chunky for my baby. I just could not get a smooth texture.
2,HB Big Mouth food processor,"Loved the processor for first 8-10 months. Then the plastic 2 piece lid started coming apart--continually. Also, I have never washed the plastic pieces in the dishwasher but it was only a matter of a few months before the plastic became so dull looking that I had to keep it covered from view. I have used it on a daily basis.One day I proceeded to fill the food bin. Turned it on. Nothing. NO hum, grind, nothing. Yes, all the parts were lined up. Same as always. Checked the circuit breaker and they were all on. Plugged another appliance into the same outlet and that applicance worked fine.Now for the worse part. This happened just one week after the 1 year warrenty expired!!As I have a disabled son who needs to have all food ground, I had to go out and buy another processor so he could have his dinner. No, I did not buy another Hamilton Beach food processor."
1,Awful experience,"My product came with no seals, so if I filled the bowl over 1/3 of the capacity, all of the liquid would spill out of the sides at the bottom and at the top of the bowl.It either comes defective without seals, or I just got a bad one. Now I'm on the way out to buy another brand. Never another Hamilton Beach one!Hamilton Beach 70590 Big Mouth 14-Cup Food Processor"
5,The only food processor you will ever need !,All the power you will ever need in a food processor. Very efficiant and easy to clean up. It is a bit tall for most cabinets but if you break it down for storing it will fit just about anywhere. Trust me when I say you can't beat it for the money and the price even with shipping was cheaper than if I were to buy it from a retail store around my home! Amazon does it again! A++++ all the way around on this product1
2,A Touch of Fantacy,"I have to agree, with most of the other's users comments. It was a bit confusing, and it helped reading their comments. I personally, as you can see, from what I usually buy, dramas, cerebral movies, was kind of lost with this one. I know this isn't much of a review, but it was great seeing a very young Tommy Lee JonesI know this doesn't have anything to do with this movie, but for fantasy, I really enjoyed ""Skellig"" which was actually a children's book and then movie. The actor who portrayed ""Skellig"", Tim Roth was excellent.Eliza's Horoscope has to do with Indian culture, mysticism (which I usually enjoy) and death. All in all, I was a bit lost."
5,Like these folders best for my collection!,I like these folders best for my own collection and have never been dissatisifed with them. Great product!!! Durable!!! Couldn't ask for more.
3,Run to Cadence with the Recon Marines,I love running to Marine Corps cadence. Takes me right back to the fleet. I will say they could have done a better job editing this thing. The time in between the tracks isn't consistent with the timing of the cadence so every ditty that comes up puts you on the wrong foot!
1,WASTE OF $$$$$$$$$$$,"First lets say that this game is not very good at all, i wish i could've spent my money on a stripper or something of that nature, because that would've put a smile on my face, I was pretty excited with the release of this game, all because of the first one, now that was a good game. If you even look at this game you might as well crumple up a fifty and take a leak on it, so if you have half a brain don't purchase this game, and if you choose not to listen to this review and go ahead and buy it anyway, you'll kick yourself in the rear later, and another thing, I wish i didn't have to give it a 1 star rating because its not even 0 worthy"
1,Goldl Toe Athletic Crew Sock are skimpy,The rise on these socks has been made shorter than all previous socks from Gold Toe; I can't stand wearing short socks. They also seem to be of a lighter weight than previous socks. I won't buy these again.
5,America's Best !,"Some albums you love the first time you hear them and other's have to grow on you over repeated listenings.This was one of the former.The first time I heard it,it became my favorite album for a couple of months.Every song is a gem.Both of the hits are solid and there is simply no filler to be found.""Old Man Took"" and ""Another Try"" are my personal favorites,but,every song is worth a listen.Every person who likes America should own this CD."
2,"Sure the critics loved this,BUT.....","...what about the rest of us?This film deserved it's SMALL audience..It is supposed to be a satire on the British upper classes,but it is so burdened down with unfamiliar,and boring pretensions as to make it a yawnfest from start to finish..the one-note joke about the dotty Peter O'toole charecter,who is supposed to become an Earl,or a Baron,or some other suchlike meaningless title but is as nutty as a fruitcake,and believes himself to be Jesus Christ to boot hardly makes up for the tedium that is so much a part of this picture...O'Toole,hanging from a cross near the swimming pool,or ranting and raving about his mission in life may look good in a one minute advertisement for this flick,but when you pay your money to own it on DVD you gotta sit through all of those OTHER minutes,when it becomes questionable if watching this movie or watching grass grow is the more entertaining past-time..I would opt for watching the grass grow..."
4,Power Metal and the Vocals of a King,"Avian features the vocals of Lance King, one of the premier power metal vocalists of our time. I first became aware of the vocals of this King in his band Pyramaze--or was it in one of his other bands, namely Shining Star? No matter: all three of these are fantastic metal bands. Avian may be the heaviest of the three, however--Pyramaze would then be a close second--and the Avian debut album, ""From the Depths of Time,"" is too good to be a debut, but a veteran vocalist in King and a veteran bass guitarist formerly of Megadeth help account for the superb quality of this release. As a guy who loves the sound of Primal Fear, Judas Priest and HammerFall, I say that Avian holds their own. Buy this CD and enjoy--and not just the music itself but also the positive lyrical content, a true rarity in the world of power metal."
2,Tedious coverage of an important topic,"Certainly a topic that needs to be addressed. It's a shame they didn't follow more of their own advice. In particular ""keep it short."" The content of this book would have made a good article, but there just wasn't a book's worth of material here.Also wish they had followed their advice about finding your own voice, avoiding templates and professional polish. The audio version was read by a professional reader who has good diction and the like, but it is obviously not the authors speaking.I found it very tedious. Didn't finish it."
5,BABE RUTH BASEBALL FIGURE,"I got this figure for my son's collection. He really enjoyed it. It was neat to see that it was in ""black and white"", making it seem even more authentic to that period in time when Babe Ruth played..."
3,"An ok book, but barely an FR novel","One of my big contentions is that when I read a Forgotten Realms novel, I want to know I am reading a FR novel. While not a bad book, this could have been placed into practically any fantasy setting and it would have altered very little. The Princess and her suitor are entertaining, but the rest of the book is flat. The one item of interest is the suiotr's abilty to just create incredible items that work without the need of magic. It is interesting to see modern warfare in a fantasy book, but at the same time a little disconcerting. Give it a read if you want something really out of the ordinary."
4,Island Soul : A memoir of Norway,I loved the book! Reading it made me feel homesick for Norway and the years my family and I lived there. A must-read for any woman about to become an expat.
3,does not come in a box as shown beware,"Don't let the picture fool you, the sealer comes in a clear plastic bag not a box as shown.amazon fails to mention that.but it also tells me when they sell at a low price how bad the buyer gets hit when the product is in a box.I've ordered this many times and would get a box w 12 small boxes inside perfect. Not this time 12 flimsy bags in one big box."
3,"Riveting, Life of Death Drama","Excellent, Documentary of legendary trip to Antarctica--- well worth taking in. Positively breathtaking scenery of walruses, penguins and glaciers, icebergs and the rugged South Pole Terrain."
4,A great set for the person who likes to learn,"I thoroughly appreciated the documentary about polar exploration which is pretty much worth the cost of the DVD set by itself. The making-of featurette is more interesting that most I have seen. The main dramatization was at times long, dark and subdued but in a way entirely appropriate to the story and the setting. A great value for those who are seeking an educational experience more than entertainment."
3,"Drones, clones, robots and cyborgs",In the order of a government Frankenstein project in the soldier of the future... a golem not made of clay. As usual for human interest thatcharacter is offset by a pretty girl ( deputy sheriff) and the men in black are chasing them. Who was he before cyborg? Why him?Answers to these and other interesting questions give the plot a little twistat the end.
1,It's Junk,I don't really know if it is just this one flashlight that I purchased or if all of them made in this style are junk. I know that it is not as bright as the last Garrity that I bought. Two candle power is all that I can say it has. Whether or not it is defective is not worth the price of sending it back to the shipper. I have enough money invested in it that it is a lose/lose situation to go to the trouble to ship it back and get only half back of what I payed for it.
1,MAC INCOMPATIBLE,"WARNING (I learned it on the aspenlaw website when I tried to install the e-book):MACINTOSH Users: AspenLaw Studydesk is not currently available for the Macintosh Operating System. However, you may use virtual machine software such as Parallels, VM Ware, or BootCamp, and the Windows OS to run the application on any Intel-powered Mac.The book itself is very informative--the flow charts, capsules, etc. are superb. So, I reordered the book only."
4,Butterfly Kisses and memories,"When I got married a little over two years ago my wife had two children from a previous marriage. Her daughter, then 8 years old, and I danced to Butterfly Kisses at the reception. Her daughter quickly became my daughter. I bought the CD for her and we used to listen to it all the time. Unfortunately my wife soon decided she wanted to be my ex-wife. She has refused to allow my to see my daughter even though we both want to see each other. Although I love the song, I am glad I don't hear it any more because it makes my heart ache. I miss my daughter more than I can find words to describe. Butterfly Kisses only scratches the surface of my feelings for my daughter."
4,Extraordinary.,"This book is so helpful, and filled with solutions to difficult problems that I am super pleased. I have this and Irving Sloane's book; together they have provided enough information for me to actually start building! I am in process, thanks to the final push of this extraordinary Benedetto book. He includes templates in the back of the book that are absolutely invaluable, and photos of beautiful guitars he has built for inspiration. The process is laid out step-by step, and accompanied by very helpful photos."
5,Making an Archtop Guitar,"This is an excellent book for someone who has the experience or motivation to build this difficult instrument. It isn't for somebody who has no woodworking experience or who doesn't have the desire to search out additional information and techniques. There is no book which covers every method and every step in building something as difficult as a carved musical instrument.The pictures are exceptional and can give much more information than pages of text. There are skimpy areas, but the book would be 1000 pages if everything Benedetto knew where written down.I've read books on building guitars, violins and carved mandolins...this is the best of the bunch, in my opinion. Many mandolin builders read it to help them with that instrument.You can do no better, but will have to find additional information on the web, in other books and from experienced woodworkers."
2,Not six; just one,"Somewhat naively, I ordered this product believing that I was purchasing a ""6 pack"" of note books, as is clearly indicated in the add. I received, however, only one. Moreover, when one factors in the cost of the postage, which is almost as much as the item itself, this turns out to be far from a good value buy. Indeed, one is far better off buying one from a local stationers if you can locate one that sells such notebooks.Why is it so difficult to purchase simple, reasonably priced, quality note books that are designed for adult academic use? The market is flooded with overpriced executive, designer nonsense, on the one hand, and dreadful Disney type stuff for school children on the other!"
2,Misleading,I was misled by pictured item !!!I was expecting two bottles of cologne with the spray head(better item) but instead received two bottles of the cheaper eu du toilet without the spray head ( must cheaper item )Was disappointed !!!!!
2,Please make him stop talking!,"There is no doubt that David Starkey is a wonderful historian and his books are great, but he does not do well on screen. There is an almost disturbing look that comes over him whenever he says the word ""sexual"" which he seems to attribute as being Elizabeth's main characteristic. Not very well presented and rather dull interpretation of a the most vivid and colorful period in history."
2,Not that Good,"I bought this video for my wife because she is so interested in Tudor history. Although this is a documentary shown on the History Channel, the production seems very amateurish. There are also ads (for the History Channel) at the beginning of each video, something we found very annoying, although we could just fast-forward thru them. It's just that when we buy a video, we didn't expect ads. We have the video of ""Elizabeth R"" the drama starring Glenda Jackson as Elizabeth, and that will always be the best historical video of Elizabeth Tudor, in our opinion."
2,"""I like it not!""","When I bought this video, I was very exited, but it turns out to be shambles! Almost all of the time we see David Starkey, HELLO! I wanted to see the HISTORICAL PEOPLE (Elizabeth I, Mary I, Henry VIII, Mary Stuart et.) in action- or a story! When they actually do show them, they are still and rarely talk! If volume were on mute, the DVD would have been USELESS! Who wants to see David Starkey talking about Elizabeth 3/4 of the time or inactive historical figures or portraits! Educational but NOT entertaining. No Story. No Action. NOT EFFECTIVE! The Documentary in Elizabeth R DVD wasn't a story and didn't much action but it was much more effective and interesting than this! Next time don't have a narrarator like Starkey in film ALL THE TIME!"
3,Nice Chair. Better for Taller people,"I purchased this chair because it had storage space and I loved the idea of a built in cooler. I am only 5'1"" so the chair is a little tall for me. When I sit in it the chair pushes into the backs of my legs and makes it a little uncomfortable. The only other problem I have with the chair is the head rest is not sturdy enough. If I want to rest my head back on the chair the material just just gives away and doesn't support my head."
3,I Wanted To Believe,"I wanted to believe but, based on what (I think) I already know, this didn't resonate for me."
1,Don't waste your money,"I can utterly guarantee that this thing won't work. I was employed in the pest control industry for 16 years. We used to find cockroaches living in such devices all the time (it's usually nice toasty warm in there). Sanitation, exclusion, and very careful application of pesticides is what you need.Rodents are sometimes repelled for a brief time, but quickly adapt (adapting to environmental conditions is one of the things rats do best). Again, count on sanitation, exclusion, and traps; try to avoid baits because you'd rather know where the little s.o.b. died (i.e. in a trap, rather than in a wall somewhere)."
2,Very frustrating for children,"I'd have to agree with the other reviewers who have said Screwy Looey is awfully frustrating for small children. My 5 year old and 2 year old have both played with this and do not understand why the drill keeps ""messing up"" before they can finish putting in/taking out the screw. The buttons and switches do not seem to reset the drill or make it work ""normally"". My kids both end up very frustrated so this toy has not been played with much in our house. Very disappointing."
1,Too Screwy - Another POOR Fisher Price Design,"I have yet to be happy with a Fisher Price toy in the last 3 years. (See my reviews of the Little People Garage, Discovery City, and train).Screwy Looey looks like a great concept, however, the drill is WAY too screwy. The switch that supposedly switches him from Screwy to Normal operation does not work at all, it is always screwy. My son can't understand why it won't drill right, and it is highly frustrating even for an adult. I can't stand touching the darn thing, because it will never do what I want it to, and the reset button doesn't help much, and is too small, as others have pointed out. In my opinion, it is time for some consumer advocate to do a report on Fisher Price, and what happened to their quality, and their fun.This is the worst designed toy ever, and the worst constructed."
3,Looey stops too quickly,"I bought this toy for my 2 1/2 year old son who loves my tool set and his toolbench. Whenever I have to unscrew his toys to put new batteries in he is right by my side helping me with my adult electric screwdriver. I thought this toy would be great.It is a little disappointing. While he is not old enough to ""play the game"" like older children to see who gets their screw in first he loves playing with it just as a screwdriver. Itis really frustrating for him b/c Looey stops after a few seconds before he can get to screw the screw all the way in. I dont understand why he stops. Is that part of the game. If it is I cant understand how it could be fun b/c the time frame that he stops is always the same so no one can get their screw in before Looey stops.I think that the toy should not have been made as a game but just as a screwdriver that does silly things or talks. At least it should work long enough for you to be able to screw something in."
5,True worship,Brings together the elements of priest and poet. Theology presented in a very accessible manner.
4,"Classic game, meets Classic Movie","If you like the Classic game Stratego and want to modernize, then this is the game for you. You can now play Stratego with Star Wars characters. While I do disagree with the way they rated some of the characters, the game is fun. It makes you think and use your brain. Stratego is a classic game, and a must for anyone who loves classic board games."
1,watch out!,"If you have an Ipod or mini disc, don't get it!It is duplication protected!I only listen to music on my mini-disc player,and I'm sitting here with a useless cd.I've bought and paid for all three Sahara Hotnights cds.The people who PAY for stuff are being punished now!I had no warning..."
1,Copy protection hazzard,"The album is OK but, the copy protection is terrible. When I place the CD in any drive and try to listen it resets my computer. I also have an expensive Bose portable CD player. It does not recognize this as a CD. So be warned MAY NOT WORK in your player! No help from Sony, RCA or BMG."
4,Slap happy,Its like walking in feathers with your feet in satin socks and a hundred dollar bill in your short shorts
5,Very comfy!,"These are really comfortable, I could wear them all day, every day. Probably wouldn't buy this same color again, but that's a personal preference."
5,CD DofS,"Perfect Conditions, Igual que lo acordado hasta Mexico sin ningun contratiempo, Excelente vendedor ( empaque sellado, embuelto en burbujas de plastico, tiempo estimado)"
5,Inspirational !!!!!!!!!,"I recently moved to Little Rock and found myself searching for draperies for my home. Unable to purchase quality window coverings I began searching for the newest and most creative ideas. The book "" The Window "" offers the most wonderful treatments. It has given me great ideas in fabrics, hardware and even fun ways to decorate my home. This book will definitelygive a kick start to your decorating dreams."
4,"Solid companion, but I wished they had some bios of the actors","Very good companion to the first season of BSG. The episode by episode guide was well done, and I liked the way that the author wrote up the character descriptions. However, it would have been nice to get a biography of each of the main and supporting players in this book. I highly recommend this to BSG fan fiction writers."
2,Too many irrelevant characters. Too long. Too tedious.,"Gregory Benford is a smart guy. It shows. The problem is when he tries to show us just how smart he is. This book shouldnt be approached unless the reader is armed with a Ph.D in astro physics. Benford introduces the concept of an esty, and although central to the plot and events of the novel, Benford does a bad job of making the etsy (is it a time? place? neither?) comprehensible to the average reader.Also, the book isnt helped by the way Benford devotes entire chapters to events and characters, who are memorable only for the degree to which they turn out to be irrelevant. A very disapointing end to a very promising series."
3,good for understanding basic black letter law,This is a good reference if you are taking the course as an elective. Provides a basic framework for the nuances of employment law and references significant cases.
2,Not worth the price,Get something nice... be careful with the face plate.. if you dont put it properly you will end up loosing it..
1,"Cheap, tacky. Bits of peeling enamel.","Nicest feature about this watch set is the box; the face is indeed ""rumpled,"" and the bezels are all marred by scratches or bits of peeling paint hanging from them. It's also tiny, not as in fashionably small, but as in won't go around a human wrist. It's perfect for a chihuahua, though, and not too pretentious. Wasting time even checking it out; I'm struggling to get reimbursed from Amazon after shipping it back. I used to believe Croton was a good company; I'm leery of trying their products again."
5,Musical,"John loves his music a lot, and I love him even though he can't sing.....but he is getting better all the time."
3,Quite good...,"This was a good program, although I had hoped for more detailed content. Some segments are really interesting... others more mundane and have been done better on other DVDs."
5,incredible.......,roddy mcdowell has always been my favorite horror movie actor & he continues his reputation in The Legend of Hell House. The BEST haunted house interpretation i've seen to date....
4,The Legend of Hell House,"Good old fashion haunted house movie. A little hokey at times, but none the less "" A good scary flick"""
5,SO YOU WANT TO BE CREEPED OUT?,"When I originally saw this movie back in the 70's, it startedme on a quest to find the Mt.Everest of haunted house stories.I never did because nothing has even come close to beating""Hell House"". From the moment the movie opens you are drawn in by the feeling that you are being watched yourself. Every time I watch this film I always feel a bit uneasy. The look and feel of the film is fantastic. BUY THIS MOVIE and READ THE BOOK byRichard Matheson"
1,Didn't do it for me...,"I'm a die-hard Richard Smallwood fan. However, ""Adoration"" was not a good album for me. I wish that Smallwood would stick to his ensemble stuff and *not* do another live album."
5,Sweet Kayaking,"Granted, I bought this because I know one of the kayakers, but the moves they do, the rivers they run... its incredible. Truly the best kayakers in the world."
2,"You'll need ""super-glue""!",The cube does not stay together! It keeps falling apart and the kids don't even have a chance to use it before it's in pieces! Skip this one and buy the original lite bright!
4,great toy,"I bought this for my 3 year old and he plays with it all the time. I love that there are 4 sides, his 18 month old sister loves it to. She uses the designs that her brother has already used and she can get the pegs into those. They both love it and there is no fighting because they can use it at the same time!"
1,Piece of Junk,"What a waste of money this was! I bought this for my daughter, based on happy memories of Lite Brite from decades past, but she can't play with it, because it's unusable. Every aspect of this toy is terrible. One can scarcely differentiate between green and yellow pegs, and between pink and orange pegs. The pegs only go in with extreme effort, and then proceed to fall right back out, especially when one is pushing in more pegs. This toy is designed so terribly, I can't believe it's an actual Hasbro toy. It seems like a chintzy no-name knock-off. I cannot stress enough how NOT worth anyone's money this toy is. Absolute hunk of garbage."
4,A fun diversion,"This is good, educational and fairly durable. The kids enjoyed it. We only wish there were refill pictures. If you buy it see if you can copy the pictures before you use them."
1,Kept getting the cheaper cube for the higher price,"I can't review this item because Amazon twice sent me the cheaper cube at the higher price, the one I actually ordered. I was told it was probably because Amazon had switched bins and the higher priced one was in the lower priced bin. I was also told there was no way to correct it. I was very disappointed because my granddaughter was really, really wanting it, it was at the very top of her wish list. Shame on Amazon for this blunder and shame on Amazon for not being able to fix it once the mistake was brought to light."
4,Ideas for Paper Refills,"I didn't want to pay alot of money for extra refills so I just made copies of the patterns that came with the Lite Brite before my kids used them. I take my own cardstock to the public library and use their machine, so for 5 cents a copy I can make unlimited refills. It really saves me money."
3,Received what I ordered quickly,I also ordered the Canon PC170 copie at the same time...the copies are very light and I can't get them darker. I don't know whether the problem is the cartrdge or the copier.
4,Extension rods worked,"They were plenty long, but a little bendy. But they worked fine. They saved me $100 on a chimney sweep"
2,Bad description,"I bought a 3"" pellet stove brush that has 1/4"" threads so I needed rods with 1/4"" female ends. That's what the description says BUT it's 1/4 NPT or pipe thread, which is WAY BIGGER than 1/4-20 thread........... Grrrr. I made up an adapter from my junk jars but why should I have had to do that!"
3,"Doesn't cover the ""Principles"" or basics.","This book should be entitled ""Tasteful Orchestration"" or something similar. Despite the title, the book assumes that the student is well beyond the developmental stage of learning the principles of orchestration, the prerequisite theory and arual skills to hear complex examples in the mind by glancing at excerpts of conductor's scores and complex passages for piano, etc. Perhaps I would give it a higher score if the the title matched the text, but I bought the book expecting that its subject matter would match the title, and I was let down."
2,Comfortably numb?,"I saw this on local television yesterday and I must agree with the texas viewer. What a let down after watching ""That's the way it is special edition"". Sad... Elvis is not ""relaxed"", he is numb, lethargic, slow and glassy-eyed. Unassured on his feet, he walks the stage hesitantly, like he doesn't know where he's going and might fall down. He is not having a good time, anyway it would be impossible, stoned like that.If you're interested in this concert, get the record instead (the official show), because the music and singing are great, and you have the best tracks of the blue hawai album as a bonus. You don't need to SEE Elvis like this, just listen. If you want to see Elvis perform, get the above-mentioned film."
5,Fun,This is the third Cheerios play book I have purchased. All of them have been a hit with my granddaughters. They are sturdy enough for a younger child.
4,Great book!,"The charts in this book are kinda big, but they look verybeautiful when they're done - and it's easy for beginners. END"
3,Its ok,Its ok. Doesn't absorb as much as I would like it but I guess for its size shouldn't expect much absorbtion.
3,DVD does NOT have 2 workouts!!,While I love the workout in this DVD. When I ordered this product it was supposed to have 2 workouts--on it. ( I have exercised with this DVD and it contains 2 workouts!) Customer review on Amazon also said it came with 2 workouts. When I recieved my order only workout 1 was on it.
5,New Canon E40 toner cartridge,Product was new (as advertised) and was delivered quickly. Have always received great products and great service from Adorama.
4,Good product,"Thus far, I am happy with this product, even though I have nothing else to compare it with."
4,Shaken--not stirred,"In order to exhibit its maximum potential, this magnificent piece of modern technology must be shaken, not stirred."
5,This covers everything!,I took this book with me on a year-long stay in Japan. There is literally nothing that I ate there that I couldn't find out about in this book. The lack of photographs is more than made up for by the excellent explanations and technique descriptions. I really appreciate that Ms. Shimbo gives you the Japanese and English names for the necessary ingredients - makes it much easier to shop for them at an Asian market.
3,not safe,"Lid does not fit snuggly on the top of the carafe, Be careful if you pour as the lid may fall off"
2,ill fitting lid,The lid does not snap on the glass carafe securely.....a few accidents..I prefer not to have to be concerned about this constantly..
3,Lid didn't fit quite right,"It is an exact replacement for the carafe that we broke, but the lid didn't fit quite right -- a bit warped. We still had the lid from the broken carafe so we used that one and we're fine."
3,"The only coffee pot for my maker, but it's fragile","This is the third one of these I have had in the 4 months I have had the maker. I think that putting cold water in the pot causes stress due to the metal band at the bottom and makes it more likely to crack so let the pot cool down before putting cold water in it. Otherwise, the pourer is good, and the best part is it holds 14 cups (whatever that means in the coffee maker world). How do they get away with calling 5 or 6 oz a cup?"
5,Essential Reading!,"I found this book to be disturbing in its depiction of the Wahabi/puritan strain of Islam which is currently on the ascendancy across the Muslim world. It is troubling to learn how a fanatical, but powerful, minority of Muslims is able to influence the evolution of Islamic thought & practice to such a great extent. This book is essential reading for any Muslim who cares about his/her faith! In addition, anyone curious about Islam will get an inside glimpse into the challenges facing Moderate Muslims who dare to disagree with the religious puritans who purport to speak on behalf of Muslims everywhere."
4,Captain Scarlet The Complete Series,"I have always liked Gerry Anderson puppetry,ever since I saw Supercar, Stingray, Thunderbirds. This particular puppetry was kind of amazing to me because in Captain Scarlet the characters really looked more human and they could do a lot of things that us actual human beings can do. Gerry Anderson really had it together when he made this particular stringed puppet show for commercial tv. Also the sets that were put together for Captain Scarlet were really amazing in themselves.Signed,Phil Hitchcock"
5,Tirp to old days,"This it was a Christmas gift to my husband. Our kids, loved it as much my husband. We enjoy afternoons with popcorn and this great trip to old days...."
5,Fun reminder of childhood,"If you buy the dvd's you might experience a problem playing first and last episodes on discs. To get around this click on the episode and you get a scene select. Use your remote to click on scene one and the entire episode will play minus the intoduction theme song. A minor inconvienience but an easy work around. Then sit back with some popcorn and wallow in nostalgia. If you watch with grand kids, they will probably get a kick out of the futuristic planes, cars, and rockets but you will have to explain what a tape recorder is. I guess digital devices were beyond the ken of writers back in the late 60's."
4,Very good for the price,"Got it through a reseller which advertises Amazon so didn't place the order through Amazon. To me they don't feel heavy at all but then I'm used to the weight of an old (>30 years) all metal pair of 7x35 Bushnells. That thing weighs more than this!Anyway, the optics are bright and clear and the rubber cladding feels good in your hands. The focusing is precise and does not drift. The only ""complaint"" I have is the cheap cloth/nylon soft case, the strap (which I replaced with an Optech I had lying around) and the funky lens cover for the small objectives (pictured). The lens cover does work but you have to finagle it and get it to ""lock"". Looks weird though.Now for the issue of whether this is made by Pentax or not, IT IS. It even comes with a warranty card that says PENTAX on it and you register the binocs by sending this back to Pentax Corporate. I don't know why there's no Pentax logo on the binocs. Maybe it's a marketing decision by Pentax but who knows."
4,Good set of nocks,"Good set of binoculars. They give a good, clear image. The carry case and neck starap are pretty cheap, but the binos themselves are what I was looking for. I'm sure if you payed more you would get more, but I just needed a good basic set of binoculars and this did it for me."
3,"Decent, especially for the price, but not Pentax","I wanted binocs for astronomical use. The ""Whitetails"" name clued me in that these were intended for birding (daytime). But the ""Pentax"" name is famous for optical quality, so I took a chance.The ""Pentax"" name does not appear anywhere on these binocs.The quality of the optics & mechanism is good, as is balance, and weight is decent. They have a large central focus wheel, better for fine focusing when one doesn't have to change focus (eg astronomy), rather than a focus paddle as I expected on binocs intended for birding. They also feel rubber-clad; I haven't drop-tested them (in water or otherwise), but that provides a more comfortable feel, not least because they don't get as cold at night. For the price (at the time, I paid less than US$40), they are a good value for astronomical binocs.I've not used them in daytime, nor in a sandy or dirty environment."
3,nice,its pretty good but i have all the bionicle toys thay are easy to build very simple the tools are an amasing thing there cindove ejacatoinale sry bad typin umm so far may favrite ones are the green red black and white ones it would be nice if thay mad them bigger tho whele there to many things to say in this paragraph so i might be back
4,Greenlee / Progressive Electronics Toner Probe,"I purchased this product because I wanted a good quality toner probe set and Greenleehas a good reputation for making quality products.When I received my set it says Progessive Electronics on the probe althoughit looks the same as the Greenlee product. I saw a Greenlee set at a distributerwith the same model #701 and it had an LED light on the tip and a headphone jack.The Progressive Electronics set I received didn't. Although the set I got does have a pouch with Greenlee printed on it.I'm not going to return it just because of the missing features,I assume it willfunction the same - I hope. I just don't want to go through the aggravation.I would have appreciated knowing this before I ordered it."
4,dog's breath,This works great!! My dachshund occasionally will try to eat lizards on the patio and then his breath is terrible! This works wonders!!
2,Wish I'd done more homework before I bought it!,"I liked this machine while it worked. It's a decent little printer and copier for home use, and it's nice to have a fax machine when you need one--don't know that I ever used the scanner (I have another one that I like). Also, my wife liked the small package. Where does Brother get an 8,000 page lifespan for the drum? A new one costs more than I paid for the machine, but I figured it'd last me 2-3 years before I had to junk the printer. However, mine only lasted nine months. This time I'm going to spend a little money and get something that'll last awhile."
5,Valuable Insights into ES and Egov Initiatives in Asia,"I was pleasantly surprised when I first came across this book on the bookshelf. With the impact of ICT on globalization,and especially with the booming ASIA, this book has not come at a better time.Having read most of the materials, I would say it is very relevant for IT practitioners and students. Not only it has documented a variety of experiences on ES and Egov initiatives, it also provides many useful practical and valuable ideas that practitioners can apply in various organizational contexts.Overall, an interesting and practical book."
5,Condor CD,My Gpa saw them in concert years ago and was excited when I found the CD. It was shipped quickly and works perfectly! Couldn't ask for more then that! Plus it made Gpa really happy too :-)
4,Roughing It,"I love Mark Twain, and Roughing It is great! His descriptions of crossing the Great Plains in a stagecoach and working in the Virginia City mines put you underground at his side, and keep you laughing. Twain writes of becoming a millionaire - on paper - and reminds us that losing one's pants in speculation is not a 21st century phenomenon.Roughing It is best when Twain is describing his travels in the American West. He goes on to Hawaii and Europe, but these tales are perfunctory, and left me wishing for more detail. Maybe Twain should have written a second book - Roughing It Abroad."
2,I simply couldn't get through it,"I had read strong reviews for this book, and bought it hoping for a good read. Perhaps this is indicative of over 140 years of transition of reading styles and ideas, but I found it a tough go and eventually gave up. The insights were terrific, but the style lengthly, wandering, and while amusing, simply more work and time than I wanted to devote to a modestly interesting read."
1,Dull and dirty,I saw little of the wit Twain is known for in this book. It's filled with long dull passages about his dirty travels from one place to another. My least favorite Twain book.
1,Don't waste your time!,"I purchased this since it was the only cup holder/snack tray I could find for a car seat. It would only fit one of the car seats I own. In addition, the cup spaces are so small that it wouldn't hold any of the child cups I own."
1,We all seem to agree.,"This cup holder was a total impulse buy in the store since my son has a cup holder on his car seat, and I thought my daughter would enjoy having one too. Unfortunately I did not have the opportunity to read everyone else's reviews, or I would have not bought it. It also does not fit on our Evenflo car seat. The actual tray part is off center when it attaches to the hook making it seem poorly balanced. I think we'd be better off with the old fashioned cup holder that hooks over the car door at the base of the window! I will definitely be returning this item to the store."
1,I assumed it would work as described...Wrong!,"I purchased this to fit onto our Graco car seat. It will not tighten, so it's wobbly. Then, I tried it on our Jeep stroller; same problem. Guess it doesn't matter. Our Nuby and Gerber sippy cups don't fit in the small holes."
1,"Nice idea, poor execution","I wish I'd read others' reviews first. In the box, this looked like a great product: Fisher-Price branding, adapters to make it fit a variety of car seats and strollers.Sadly, I had the same experiences as many of the other reviewers: I managed to mount the holder on my stroller, but the only place it would fit was out of my son's reach far below seat level and at an angle that made it look like a ship in danger of capsizing. The easy-to-install mount was also a bit flimsy, wobbling if I so much as looked at it the wrong way.""That's not so bad,"" I lied to myself, ""after all, sippy cups are designed to not leak if they're at an angle."" Unfortunately, there wasn't a single sippy cup in the household that would fit in the cup holder.I'm darned if I'm going to buy another set of sippy cups just to fit in a wobbly tray that my son can't reach. Back it goes!"
1,DON'T BOTHER!,"If I could give this negative star review I would. It would be a negative 5 - for waste of a busy mom's time!!!!I couldn't return this item because we waited too long to try & use it. I know why they don't want them back...because they don't WORK! I own 3 different car seats & this ""tray"" doesn't work on any of them. It doesn't work on any of the strollers I own or any of my friends! I also tested it on several of my friends car seats to see if they could use it, so at least someone could use it...and it did not work on those car seats as well. So if you own a Cosco, Graco, Peg Perego, & yes Fisher Price convertible car seats it won't work. Please save your money & buy the Taby Tray from OneStepAhead it is world's better & saves you a headache as well."
2,go easy on it,"I managed to break the thing inside of 3 months. In fairness to the product, I did treat it a bit rough- hiking, camping, ect. Here's the deal, this model has a wheel for volume control instead of buttons. At some point I either set my bag down too hard or just packed everything too tight and both the volume wheel and the headphone jack sort of collapsed into the unit. It still works but the sound quality is VERY poor and of course the volume stays at one level only. Just a warning to people who treat thier stuff like I do! Some good points: Before it broke the thing sounded great (not with the original headphones of course), it NEVER skipped, it is very small and light, and the battery life is very long- around 30 hours."
3,"Lovely to look at, difficult to read","The illustrations and design of this book are delightful, as is the case with the others in the series. I wish, though, that the text were less focused on facts and figures and more on evoking the scene. It's not entirely clear to me that this volume works as a children's book, even though a city with water for streets and boats instead of cars has a natural appeal for young readers. I just don't think the text describes anything much they can 1) understand or 2) find interesting. If you plan to read this to kids, bring your imagination. I simply make up a different story to go with the pictures, and my neice and nephew love it."
2,review from the Synthesis,"So the rip is this dude was signed and was supposed to be that next great white rapper, but then he got dropped. Thank God, but unfortunately he persisted and now we have The Great Escape. If anything, Hot Karl doesn't front: he sounds and raps like the white nerd he is, or appears to be on the cover art. His lyrics touch on beat topics like why is rap so materialistic and commercial, reminiscent songs (""Kerk Gybson"") and how the suburbs are a hard place to live (""Home Sweet Home""). The production is overly polished with a pop feel, making the album even more unbearable. Maybe I don't get the joke, but for real, this is up there with Paul Barman.- Corey BloomSynthesis.net"
4,My daughter wanted it read over and over!,"Bert & Ernie go shopping. They have a list, but keep getting distracted. Will they remember the oatmeal that they started out to get? Rhyming foods, like ""cheesie pleasie"" children pick up on and use again and again. When she was 3 to 5 it was one of her favorite books."
1,NO worky,I bought these a month ago and they absolutely DID NOT work for me. I have a photo to prove it. Seems like they have gotten worse since i got these. I find more mouse poo and pee than ever before. I have a photo of a mouse being caught in a glue trap right underneath the repellent! This has happened 3 times already. It's crazy. Big waste of money for me.
3,Good but dated and too idealistic,"A romance should be sweet and neat, but not unbeliveable and outdated. These stories are wonderful romances for young girls, but lack enough steam and substance for anyone over the age of 21."
5,Like Jon Mayer? You'll LOVE JAK,"Wow. I have both of Jak's CDs. Each is awesome. Extremely well done - lyrics, music, tone...wow. I can't wait until a third album. I can't get enough. He's my new favorite singer-songwriter. You WILL NOT be disappointed with this purchase."
3,Pretty nice,"It's a little bulkier than I thought it would be. I would recommend it only for transporting knives rather than a permanent storage place for them. It is well-made, and keeps the knives from scratching each other."
3,It does what it needs to do,I admit it my husband and I are knife snobs. We cook a lot at our friends' houses since our house is too small for entertaining. When we do this we usually bring our own knives. So it serves the purpose of being able to safely transport our knives every month or so. If I was going to use it more often (daily) I think I would look for something that held the knives a bit more securely and had a shoulder strap. But for us it does what it needs to do!
2,A Piece of Junk,"This game has ended up in the trash bin--it's made of cheap plastic, falls apart easily, it's difficult to get all the sticks in, nobody wants to put the sticks back in because that's very boring. I think my memory has failed me--I thought this used to be a fun game when my kids were little--I sure don't remember all the hassles with it. But I've noticed the quality of games/toys nowadays can be very poor--so many cheezy, cheapo parts. Save your money and buy something else."
2,Alot of trouble,This game sounded so promising on the box but when my 6 year old go it for Christmas last year we were very disappointed. The sticks break easily and they are hard to put and and very time consuming to do also. She was bored with it before we could get the sticks in. It is to difficult for her to set up by herself.SAVE YOUR MONEY!
1,drunk on metaphors,"This is a book about excess. Excess alcohol, excess metaphors. It's hard to decide which is more repelling-- the author's repeated debauchery in the cistern of alcoholism or her over-metaphored writing style. I found both equally hard to take. As a father of daughters, I hoped to gain some insight into peer pressures girls and young women face so I perservered to the end of this too-long tome. Big mistake. Read any chapter in the middle of the book and you have ""the take home message"". I could sacrifice wading through an unappealing writing style for the sake of knowledge but it was a struggle that was singularly unrewarding. I wish the author well in her stuggle to remain sober and to eke out a living with her writing."
2,"Been there, done that.","This would have been an interesting read, had it not already been written...by Caroline Knapp."
2,Make it stop!!!,"Ugh. Despite Zailckas's messages and warnings and statistics and stories upon stories (filled, might I add, with absolutely HORRENDOUS metaphors at every turn) about drinking, I was almost forced to crack open a bottle of Jack just to make it through this book! Sure, I felt a litle something for Zailckas what with crippling self-esteem problems and all, and even related to most of her drinking experiences, but this book is anything from fresh news. Not to mention that it reads like a story you're forced to workshop in a bad freshman year creative writing workshop. I feel like I - or really any of my friends - could not only have written this book, but written it better. So why didn't we? Because we're too busy binge dirnking!!! Hooray!"
3,Books were delivered,I ordered 3 copies of the same book from seller(3.99 shipping per item). All 3 were sent in one package. From IN to MO it took 10 days to get here (within 14 day timespan mentioned by Amazon). Didn't get any correspondence from seller. I started to worry but had to wait 2 weeks before contacting. Items were as described by seller's description.
2,Not as Interesting as You Would Think,"The good thing about this book is that it showed me that if Ms. Zalickas can get published, I can probably get published one day. It has a juicy title, but it is not too interesting of a read. I kept waiting for something to happen. Nothing really did. She gets drunk in high school. She gets drunk in college. Ummmm....join the club. Granted, her drinking is excessive but she really doesn't have anything creative to say about it. I found her writing subpar. At times, I felt like I was reading half of a college essay and half of a novel. She also repeats herself over and over and over again. ""I got drunk because I hated myself. I got drunk because I couldn't be close to someone."" Yeah yeah yeah. I GET IT. She also goes on these diatribes about drinking and masculinity/femininity that are these random generalizations."
1,Boring,"I thought this book was boring. It was a waste of my time to read it, and I wish I never read it. She just moans and wails and moans and wails. She is a low self-esteemed alcholic and an annoying one at that. Then all of a sudden, she starts preaching about crap in the last 20 pages of the book. The last few pages of the book made my stomach turn. If I could give this book zero stars I would."
2,annoying and pretentious,"I wanted to like this book and went into it with an open mind. Yes, Koren approaches the topic of ""drinking"" in an honest way but she is not honest about herself. She refuses to call herself an alcoholic and casts judgement about alcoholics and AA and addiction counselors, while at the same time describing her own obvious alcoholic behaviour. I was thoroughly annoyed with her personality, she came off as a snobbish know-it-all and constantly reminded readers that she was, in fact, a literary scholar. Judging by her choppy writing, I disagree.It was difficult to keep a clear timeline of events as she merely jumped from one story about blackouts to the next. I walked away from ""Smashed"" thoroughly disapointed and $14 poorer."
4,Fantastic read,"I bought this book because after reading the opening paragraph i was hooked. In a sense, it gave me a different perspective to view alcoholics/alcohol-dependent people/binge drinkers, and while I used to wonder whether it was something about the 'cool' factor that made people drink non-stop, Zailckas' brutally honest writing style has made me think differently.Highly recommended not just for drinkers or people with family members that binge drink, but for everyone. I'm pretty sure some time in our lives, most, if not all, of us have passed certain unfair judgements on people we see passed out at bars or places like this, and this book offers a refreshingly different viewpoint."
3,one out of 2 arrived completely broken in pieces,"I just didn't take time to go through the process of returning the broken item. but, I bought the two because I wanted a matching set for the newly rescued cats."
5,Life is but a dream,"I had the very good fortune to live the image on the cover. While hearing this CD you can imagine sitting on a beach in Thailand, basically watching the sunset surrounded by all these beautiful mellow people. I was in Rai Lei Beach on a beautifulevening with this playing,.. it was perfection! I had to buy it and so should you!"
1,?,"I don't know why someone would need this. I have a SNES, N64, Playstation and an Atari hooked up to my TV and they're fine without a switcher. I just have to make sure I only turn on one at a time otherwise the TV gets really confused ;"
2,Very Basic Information,"This video provides only very basic information about boat buying. The first ten minutes are spent learning terms like ""bow"" and ""stern."" I was expecting more specific information on buying a sailboat like common trouble spots, things to look for on older boats, information on blistering problems, etc. This video provides none of that. If you have been on a boat, and you have purchased a used car, you already have the knowledge that this video would teach you. It also appears to be about 15yrs old. If you have no prior boating knowledge, or have never bought/insured a vehicle or boat, this video may be of some interest to you."
2,A New Pennywise Album... I Think!,"Pennywise have rocked for years. With an amazing vocalist and heavy guitars, with new provocative ideas, these guys were truly punk. Unfortunately, lately, they have failed to offer us anything new. This album is basically the same as the last one, which means the future does not look good. Just like when Blink 182 realized their pop-punk sound mixed with lyrics that would sell could make them famous, they sold out. It appears Pennywise isn't far behind them, only this time the lyrics are a bit different. I hope that Epitaph drops these guys quickly before they embarass them. The only reason why this album deserved two stars is the amazing vocals."
3,Good stuff but it's all the same...,"Pennywise is a great band but I must say that a lot (and I do mean a lot) of their music is the exact same thing. This cd is no expection. Almost every song has the same meaning and to me this is kind of annoying and unoriginal. I don't understand why people think punk music all needs to be about anti-government, anti-authority, anti-etc. Don't be so damn narrowminded."
5,Still the best new punk band,"This is probably the greatest band that ever played. They continue to come up with unique riffs and good bass lines. A little too Democrat, but I like the My God."
2,Not interesting to this Bowden fan,"I thought this book was very boring and it just seemed to drag on and on. I do like Bobby Bowden and the Seminoles, but this book did not pique my interest at all. There is alot of stuff about God and The Bible when there could have been more of an inside look at the FSU program. email if you have any questions."
5,Great LCD for the price.,"Some people would complain if they had meat in their sandwich. I got my Olevia LT32HV 32"" HDTV-Ready Flat-Panel LCD TV about a week ago and I can't find anything wrong... DARN!! It's hooked up to digital cable at the moment so things are only good as the signal supplied. I'm in the middle of a move so I can't really hookup all my goodies but I'm truly satisfied with it as it is. If anyone has a problem with this TV, I feel they shouldn't operate anything more complicated than a door knob. It really is a good TV. The owners manual is a little skimpy but that's it."
2,Disappointed,"My husband and I bought the 32"". We saw it on shop at home. Of course it looked great on tv and the price was right on target.com. After some delay it arrived. The picture was very red and needed constant adjustment. We contacted Syntax who sent a new main board and a tech to install it. That part was defective. So we were sent a replacement set. We pulled the box off the new tv to discover a very large dent on the top of the back panel. So back went the first two tv's. We now have our third tv and it too is damaged!!! Something is wrong with the stand causing it to tilt forward. We are now waiting for #4!!! We're keeping our fingers crossed. We're very disappointed in Syntax's quality control."
3,Don't waste your money,"The audio on this set is bad. when I brought this set home I thought something was wrong with it because it wouldn't play loud enough to hear it well.I returned to the store and they gave me another.Brought it home same thing.Contacted Syntax tech dept no help. I then contacted customer service they did not even respond.A bargan is not always a bargan,let the buyer beware."
1,Caveat Emptor,"One of the worst books I have ever read in my 50 years of literacy. Absolutely dreadful. I should have known when I saw the jacket: a woman's figure from the wrong era pasted onto a pine farm.The book is overwritten and under-imagined. The characters are cardboard and impossible to view with empathy or even affection--apathy is more like it. (Why must novels about my native South be peopled by bizarre, perfervid gothic types?) Unimportant action is minutely detailed, while major movements are left unrealized. The dialogue is artificial, imperfectly accented, and stagy; in fact, the entire book is stagy, as if it were written with film in mind. (God help the director.) Imagery is strained and distracting, and the observations of nature are sometimes inaccurate. There are even grammar errors (shudder).In all, this novel was not worth the (pine-derived?) paper on which it was printed."
1,Extremely bad product,"This product is one of the worse I've ever purchased. It does not work nor does what its suppose to, actually it does nothing. If you're considering buying this product do not waist your money.Thx;Jose"
1,Not worth it,The product did nothing as advertised. ED can't suddenly be cured by a handful of herbal products. Put your money into diet and excerise or save it up for Viagra
4,This is a very upbeat way to praise Him.,I really enjoyed this CD. The young women on this CD have beautiful voices. I enjoy pumping them up in my car and still be able to give Him praise at the same time.
2,ONE OF HER WORST,I KNOW THAT I SAID THAT ALL OF HER MUSIC IS GREAT BUT NOT THIS ONE. THIS ONE IS HER WORST. I REALLY DONT LIKE THIS ONE. I FELL LIKE SHE COULD HAVE PICK BETTER SONGS. I THINK THAT YOU SHOULD BUY THIS ONE BECUASE THIS IS WORTHLESS. THIS IS BAD REALLY BUY. SHE HAS BETTER ONES
1,SUCKED,These people crack me up trying to sell a lame movie like this for $120.00. I wouldn't pay 2 cents for this trash. DREAM ON
4,ENJOYABLE AND EASY STEPS,"Your instructor, Sarita Lou, a lively & energetic dancer will lead you through 2 light-aerobic dance workouts: 20 minutes of OLD SCHOOL and SEXY SCULPT. You will have a basic, key move and you will return to that move once you add on. OLD SCHOOL seemed to focus on the lower body with deep plies, sliding, and hops among others. There are moves that are based on the single, single, double beat, which Sarita failed to cue us on. She did cue us in SEXY SCULPT, though. In OLD SCHOOL, Sarita didn't really focus on the arms, not until SEXY SCULPT. SEXY SCULPT includes body rolls, squats, step it out plies, et al. Overall, the music was appropriate in helping with rhythm and the dance steps, the choreography was generally easy to follow, uncomplicated, and fun to do. The only thing I found was the lighting was a bit dim."
1,Not fun,"I ordered this video for myself and my daughter to work out- we thought it would be fun. The music was lame- not anything that got us wanting to get up and go- more like boring background music. The video only features the same girl working out, and it feels like a traditional work out- not like a dance routine. We were hoping to dance, have fun, and get our heart rates going- instead we turned it off after about 20 minutes and were sad we had wasted our money on it!"
2,"Cleans well, but doesn't fix much","I am very frustrated because I purchased this macine and Amazon still carries the machine, but not the refills. I need more cleaning wheels and cleaning solution."
4,excellent for current or future Marines,This Compilation of original Marine Cadence's is superb! i highly recomend the entire series.
1,Cornucopia Fraud,Please look up Flint River Express for details on Cornucopia products and the mess that is their company.
1,WARNING! Not the novel. It is the play.,I just received this in the mail to give to my niece and discovered that it is written as a play. The Amazon description does not mention any thing about it being a play. Arggh! Frustrating.
1,disk rating,I chose this rating and I dislike this item because it cannot play on my dvd players or it freezes I would recommend to a friend only if is in good conditions of play or quality
5,Fantastic Workout,"I wish there were more like this. Great scenery, great music, helpful guidance for how long to expect to be holding a given intensity. It makes it so that spinning at home is more fun than spinning with your best spinning teacher. It also makes you want to really get out and ride outdoors! Good intensity, too. My heart rate varied between 160 and 180 (didn't check during the highest exertion periods), and I'm a 28 year old female. Of course you could do it harder or easeier, as well."
4,This album has a powerful message and outstanding vocals!,"This album is truly a blessing. Guest Beverly Crawford is a powerhouse!! It really didn't exceed my expectations, but it's great. Listen to the title song and it'll bless you! Great production from Donald Lawrence!"
5,Something Special,"I have been a follower of Michael Palin's adventures (Pole To Pole, Full Circle & Sahara). I have all of these on video and I have read them also. But this book is special as it is his first and hardest to get on video or DVD. When you read this you get the feeling that you are there with him. The way he explains every event and place he visits. If you are in to reading this a must read along with his other adventure books. Also, if you enjoy watching his adventures put you name in for the re-release of this on DVD as it is available in the UK but you can't watch it in Canada as it is a different DVD region. So give you email address an get it in to Canada. You won't be disappointed."
1,Horrible,"This movie is terrible. It gives a bad name to vampires all everywhere. The only good part is the lead vampire...she's a hottie...other than that, forget it."
4,I think I lost my luggage,This is a very good bag. Very sturdy and resistant. It has 16 pockets varying in size. The only problem is it is far from being a bag that you can quickly reach into and grab a knife. It folds out into a 2'x 2' square. You then unzip the protective cover and fold that over. This leaves you with the need to have an area of 2'x 4' unless you allow the flap to hang over the edge of the table. All of this just to grab one knife. If you are working in a tight kitchen you should make sure to take out all the knives you will need at once.
1,Well...,"Swedenborg is truly a genius. With this in mind, I figured a nice copy of ""True Christian Religion"" would be a good thing to have.When I put the order through for this item, I discovered that the item is actually part 2 of a 2-volume set of the complete work, ""True Christian Religion."" I don't see this indicated anywhere in the product description.If you do wish to purchase this item, and can find part 1 of this 2-volume set, by all means do it. The book looks nice and reads well, it's well bound and all... it's just disappointing to be sitting here with half of a great book."
4,"Useful Book for the new user, no technical stuff","If you are a new SAP user, you should definetely read this book. It highlights the SAP basics, but if you are looking for more advanced and technical explanations you should search for other books."
4,Assigned Reading,"I was assigned this text for a college-level parenting course. It was easy to read and made sense. If I had the class to teach, I would use this book."
3,OK but with one annoying feature,Gloves are warm enough and reasonably well made but the wrist openings are too tight and restrictive making one fight to put them on. I will not be buying more.
4,Talks the truth about track and field,"Even though I know drug use runs rampant in track and field today, this book presents a side of the sport that dearly needed to be said. Most people have been too scared to publicly talk about it which I applaud him for. This book also brought to my attention the new style training methods on speed which I found extremely helpful. I would recommend this book to anyone who thinks Maurice Green or Donavan Bailey aren't on Steriods or any other form of banned ergogenic aids."
1,Not for visual learners,"If you are able learn by reading through pages of step by step instructions then this is great. However if you are a visual learner, like myself, this book will be painful. The DVD is not helpful.It does have a lof of helpful information, but this ""complete idiot"" just couldn't get into this book. Gonna take it back."
3,disappointed,"This was not what I was looking for. I am a beginner and yes it explains some of the dance terminology I am not familiar with but it doesn't break down the steps as I had hoped. Basically it has you learn the terminology, then lists the steps. But I don't have the time to sit and read all of this book and you have to be familiar with the terminology to figure out the steps. I was hoping it would have diagrams or something simple....,layman's terms, not dancers terms. If you are really looking to understand the dances and maybe compete..this might be a good starting point but if you are just looking to learn a few steps quickly, I would not recommend it."
4,Good Food,"Not only does the book contain helpful information about the heart, the recipies are delicious. My husband and I found we were eating smaller portions and feeling satisfied which helped us both to lose some weight."
5,An old time classic,"Totally agree with all the 5 star reviewers. Really nothing more I can add, it's all been said.It's an old time classic and like other great classics like e.g. ""Una Giornata particolare"" or ""West Side Story"" this is a movie I have to watch again from time to time. Absolutely Worthwhile."
3,OPERATON BRAIN SURGERY,I purchased this for my grandson age 5. He enjoys trying to match the cards with the pieces before time runs out.
3,Poor quality Control at Hasbro,"I bought this from Amazon for my 5 year old in October, but did not open it until Christmas. Sadly, the game does not work properly. He is supposed to buzz and tell you your time is up if you jiggle his head too much while fishing for items, ours won't do a thing, even with major shaking and jiggling. After a call to Hasbro I received a packing slip to send the broken game back to them the next day. This is the 3rd (out of 3 purchases) Electronic Childs game made by Hasbro we've bought that has been defective. I will no longer pay a premium price for a broken game. We'll stick to the cheap-o no-frills games from now on."
4,cute came,"my daughters like this game and it helps them to try to recognize things by shape. Even my 9 year old likes to play it. We changed the rules a little, but they ask to play it on game night."
1,Boring,"Don't waste your money on this pointless toy. My son received this game as a Christmas present when he was three. When we turned it on, he freaked out and cried every time we tried to play. The game has been played with maybe 3 times in 3 years. Even once he got older and wasn't afraid of it any more, he still found it boring to play. There just isn't much excitement or strategy built into the game. I think it's time to finally give it away."
5,Pleased,"I got exactly what I was after, and it got here quicker than I expected. Excellent movie, if you don't mind reading subtitles. I'd been looking for this movie for years after I saw it at a friends house, found it on here for cheap and brand new. I'm completely happy with my purchase."
5,Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham,This is an awesome movie. This movie touches the hearts of everyone in my family. anyone who hasn't seem this movie needs to.
1,"Can't see half the writing, no customer support.","Half the words are jumbled, as if squished together, so can't see them. Book is useless that way. Sent two different complaints to Amazon and got no response. Now it doesn't even give me an option to return the book. I'll adjust my review if this gets solved."
2,celtic worship,I found the album too restrained and technically correct. Great for a quiet meditation but not stirring to the soul.
4,A strong worship album with a celtic influence,"If you want a good worship album and you like a celtic influence you'll love this album. The album is definately more ""worship"" than ""celtic"" (there are some celtic instruments used on the album but it is really more ""pop"" with a ""celtic"" influence). The haunting vocals and strong worship lyrics from songs that have already run the worship circuit help to focus the listener on God. Listening to this album will help to prepare you to spend time with God."
1,Arrived broken!!!!! Unusable!!!,"Package did not protect this very delicate, thin glass product. Arrived broken!!!!! Unusable!!!"
5,David Sanborn plays a wonderfull concert,"I bought this DVD last month, David Sanborn play concert for Saxophone?, I did have not idea that this video was a great adquisition for my collection. I Recomment it if you are jazz lover, surely enjoy this concert."
5,Love this album,"I love this album I grew up lesioning to it and I just love all of the songs on this album, some more then others though"
5,a friend.....and fellow songwriter,"I HAVE YOUR C.D.,'THINGS I PRAYED FOR', IT WAS A REFRESHING CHANGE. I AM STILL WAITING FOR YOU TO AUTOGRAPH IT LIKE YOU PROMISED. HA HA . I AM VERY PROUD OF YOU. GOD BLESS. YOUR FRIEND, MELODY"
5,Yamaha Power Adapter,The adapter is exactly what you need to power the drum set. I don't know why Yamaha doesn't include it with the drums.
3,Reasonably Van Dammaged,"This film is actually a lot better than it gets credit for, and the reasons for this are the 'Coma'-inspired plot, and the fun supporting cast, which includes Robert Guillaume as a veteran inmate. Endlessly quotable."
4,whoa flashy new cover,Classic B movie action. A good transfer to blu-ray but did anybody notice that the new cover has a scene from lion heart on it. seems like a pretty big mistake i mean come on its an entirely different movie.
5,Love this music,I'm updating my favorite cassettes to CDs and was thankful to find one of my very favorite worship music CDs.
5,Fun Game,This boardgame is a bit complex but it is trying to translate a card game into some things else and that's not an easy task. The pieces are well made and if you read the directions carefully you'll have hours of fun with this one.
2,Not the same product as advertised,"This product has the same model ID as what is sold in the stores. However, it is a different product. The bad is design is the same, but it has a thinner frame to it and definitely not as heavy duty. I was Dissappointed in how this was sold"
2,Not great,"I thought it would be a vacation guide to Key West. It was not. Firstly, it is very short. Just over 50 minutes. It did not point out specific sites or the best places to go (someone had stated it was an ""insiders view"", I would disagree). It did feature the ""Conch Train"" which was sort of interesting. But it was mainly a historical/cultural look at Key West. In doing so, it was far too brief to be particularly effective.Also, it came in a cheap cardboard container. Not the typical size or construction of a DVD container. For the price, I expect better.Bottom line, if you are looking for a vacation guide try something else. If you just want to see what Key West ""looks like"", you may enjoy this DVD. Even then, it is far to brief to justify the cost ... Not particularly well done either."
4,An insightful comedy,"Ben Elton continues to merge his personal experiences with his acute feel for comedy.'Inconceivable' is an extremely poignant story which manages to relate the day-to-day ordeal of a couple facing a fertility crisis as well as depicting the effects which said problem has on the average couple.In true Elton fashion, 'Inconceivable' does not take the reader through 400 pages of morbid reality but rather enlightens while entertaining.I personally read this book on my honeymoon and found myself hugging my wife, not taking my life for granted and laughing out loud for a whole day. That is how long it took me to read this book. It is simply un-put-downable."
5,He said - She said - and I laughed out loud,"Great book. I liked Popcorn, but I loved Inconceivable. The book works as we gain insight into the minds of a married copuple through their hysterical thoughts on a subject as potentially powerful as having a baby together. What a comedy setup. And Elton's writing is terrific. Funny almost always, but here and there some sad and serious parts (but not too many!)."
2,"First half good, second half BAD.","I agree with the other posters who thought this book was hilarious--up to a point. Where it all went south for me was when the husband started acting like a total jerk by writing a screenplay about their experiences, selling it, and starting filming on the project. I won't spoil the rest, but by the end I was so disgusted with the husband, the wife, and their situation, that I wanted my money back. I'm so glad I bought this used instead of new.Also, maybe this shows the male point of view on infertility well, but not the female one. There's so little detail on what the woman actually goes through in a trying to conceive cycle--it's laughable.If you get it, enjoy the beginning, and don't feel bad about skimming the second half. The shift in tone and characterization is jarring; too bad the author spoiled such a good beginning."
4,Invisible Radios is lo-fi subversity at its finest...,"off-camber declarations like ""...Voice mail is an invisible microphone controlled by a ghost..."" & more unsettling originality abounds in Kevin Sampsell's latest collection, INVISIBLE RADIOS: RE-MIXES, STATISTICS, JOKES, ETC. the ""statistic"" poem ""My New Level of Despair"" in this book is reminiscent of Sampsell's hilariously disorienting earlier work (HOW TO LOSE YOUR MIND WITH THE LIGHTS ON and LET'S START SOMETHING SPECIAL). at any rate, the writer is adept at slapping together psychosexual imagery & situational comedies so real/unreal that the reader is left in a state of dumbstruck awe that someone has actually recorded our innermost impulses & perversities of natural thought. it's a laugh. one can't help wondering while reading Sampsell's work WHAT exactly is going on & that's the art of it--the meanings are left open for the reader to decide. no static here. recommended...."
4,Irish Movie,Had to buy this movie as I was going to this island of Aran. Stayed in the B&B that was built for the director.
2,Affected the neighbor's dog,"This thing appears to be working. Mice were gone while it was on for 2 days, and one came back 3 hours after we shut it off.HOWEVER, 2 important points to consider1) It obviously affects more than just pests. Even in ""quiet"" ""pest"" mode, our neighbor's dog (2 flights down) refused to leave the apartment and appeared sick for two days. We found out he's acting sick in a random chat, thought there might be a connection, turned this thing off and within 10 minutes he was back to normal. I would not use this around pets - and by that I mean at least 50 yards away.2) It's noisy. It makes a very audible clicking sound which could be suitable for a garage environment, but not in a place where you'd want to hang around in."
5,Repells Wasp!,"I have used one in my screened in porch for 3 years to repel mice,tree roaches, wasp etc...It works wonderful. I moved it to my hot tub outdoor room: because the wasp made it impossible to enjoy my tub. Zap...I seldom see one and when I do it is slow and barely moving. I just ordered two more. One for the barn at our farm. I hope it works on ""mud dobbers"" and one one to replace the one I am using for my hot tub area. Wish I had of ordered more.."
2,Doesn't work for spiders,"I bought this item about a month ago...I have a brown widow problem on my screened in porch. I set it up on the insect setting on medium volume. It sounds a little like cicadas or other type bug, but inside the house, with the door closed it wasn't noticeable. It does have a loud and a quiet setting, if you did need it inside.I turned it on and moved it's location once a week around the patio. However, it's been in it's current spot for the last two weeks and I just found a large brown widow and two happy little egg sacs living only 6 inches away from the unit right under my child's tricycle. :(I was really hoping this would be my answer for my spider problem, but it doesn't seem to be.If you are looking for a spider repeller...this is not it. If anyone has found one that does work on spiders, please let me know! :) Thanks"
3,Squirrels won,"I purchased this item because I have squirrels living in my bedroom ceiling. They come in by my chimney and play their games while chewing on my ceiling beams.When I got this item I had it set on the loud setting. It did keep them at bay but the noise was not very comfortable. We reduced the volume to silent for humans. The noise was gone but the squirrels returned. We have not seen the mice we expected and possibly a reduction of smaller bugs but it did not do what I had hoped it would do for the squirrels. They chewed through sofit, insulation and wood. I will keep trying it in the hopes that at some point the squirrels will get fed up with the sound. I just won't hold my breathe."
4,A real Noise Maker,"You should only buy this if you have a serious mouse/rodent problem. Our office building has a severe mice infestation, and nothing else worked. We used several of those un-audible devices but they made no difference. Only this unit set on high keeps the mice away. The sound is VERY audible at this setting. (Even for our neighboring office). We only put it on when we leave the office for the day. Haven't seen any mouse droppings in the morning since then.I wouldn't recommend this device for home usage. Since even the lowest setting is somewhat audible. But for any tough job... this is the be(a)st!"
2,2 stars for Goodwin and Foster,"Essentially this dysfunctional film implodes on itself in numerous ways, so much so that any description of the plot or otherwise would just be boring. The only two reasons to see this would be to watch the range that Ben Foster and Ginnifer Goodwin have. I liked Foster in 3:10 to Yuma and I think this role helped show his variety, as with Goodwin.This is not a film to grab if you think Hillary Swank, Perry or Graham do anything special. Swank has 5 scenes, Perry spends half the film on a toilet (toilet humor does not work for me anymore) and Graham just seemed to miss it. Watching Perry scoop dog crap up well over ten times didn't work for me either. I like the films from First Look, but this one doesn't meet the grade of competency, except for Foster building a solid foundation - and when I think about it he actually had more screen time than anyone, so maybe they should change the cover art to him."
3,A good Chuck Norris-flick!,"I have seen Delta Force atleast two times, the second time was quite recently. This is what I think of it: The scene with the two terrorists on the plane is too long. They should have shortened that part. The action is good, but there's too little of it, especially the hand-to-hand combats are too few. But the final fight between Chuck and the terrorist leader is very good! I must say, it's one of the best Chuck Norris films I've seen! (I've seen about ten)"
2,"Good movie, bad music.","The movie is good, has nice action scenes, the terrorists are bad but not as bad as the real ones (well this is a pre 9/11 movie) so I could give this movie 3 stars; however, the music is horrendous, it sound as a Saturday morning GI Joe cartoon. It makes you not to care for the characters because it reminds you that it's just all fictional and that the good guys are going to end up killing the bad guys and there is not tension in it. If this type of music wouldn't be in the movie, or even if there would be no music at all, it would be better. The director should have put this music only at the end credits, that's it. So because of this music, and being generous, I give this movie two stars.Alan Sylvestri is a good composer but I think, this is one of his worst jobs."
2,Thin as a Kmart carboard,"This is an action/war movie originally released in 1986. This DVD contains the original theatrical trailer along with Spanish and French subtitles.Basically aside from having the iconic Chuck Norris along with Lee Marvin, this movie is thin without much of a story and cookie-cutter characters. The action scenes weren't bad but become repetitious after awhile.One amusing blooper was towards the end when Lee Marvin picked up the reciever of his cool 80's ""porta-phone"" and began barking out orders before the reciever even reached his mouth. If you are an action-hound then add another star, otherwise it's just some mindless explosions and not much else."
1,Hurtful propoganda at its worst,"There is a line in this film that says Israel and the terrorists are ""using the media to get on their side!"" . . . not a good idea when the West has the monopoly on that idea. I can't believe this movie was made without more of an outcry from Arabs - though there probably was and it was silenced. In South Africa the policy of racial divide was so hated that it no longer exists. In Israel, it is allowed because it is tied together with religion so you are deemed a racist if you disagree with its policies.This movies is propoganda, period. It is horribly acted and the story is predicatable, even for the 80s."
1,Terrible,"I thought this would be fun for my baby to play with. The suction cup doesn't work very well, the toys fall off, and the flower part is way too low and she hits her head on it constantly! I bought some rubber duckies, and those seem to be entertaining her just fine! I'm returning this today to buy something more useful. Maybe tot locks...."
1,nice try,it is a really cute toy; in the box. the toys don't fit on the little worms to hang. my son kept pulling it off the side of the tub. so we just gave him all the little toys to play with. he ate the frog and the whole mouth split open from the little squirt hole. don't waste your money.
3,"Reasonable, but not exceptional text","Bogart has done a decent job with this text. It does a good job of covering a broad selection of topics and is generally readable. Beware the typographical errors, as they are often very subtle and leave you wondering if it was an error or if you just don't understand. Don't let Chapter 1 give you the wrong impression of the text, as it belabors things much more than the rest of the text does. It initally left a bad taste in my mouth, but the remainder of the book provides the right amount of exposition, except for a few points in Chapter 6 (Combinatorial Designs) where Bogart leaves too many proofs as exercises without giving a sufficient idea on how to complete the proof."
4,Too Bad It Came Out When It Did,"I saw it on tv when it came out in 1996. I was in complete suspense throughout the film, and the ending was a rare treat of happiness and hope admist tragedy. And I was happy to have enjoyed the film. The characters were very in depth an real. You could see relationships forming, which is rare in films. I mean, most movies just feature characters whom colaborate in a series of unrealistic events. But this movie was different, and I think it was the best TV movie ever made. It's only a shame that it cameout when it did, for James Cameron's version outnumbered this one. But overall, it was an excellent film."
5,Uplifting and Easy,"A well organized collection of uplifting quotes for those days when we all can use some thought or change of perspective to lift our spirits. You can go through the table of contents to find quotes for your particular troubles, or just open to any page and get either a laugh or just some relief. And its appropriate not only for you, but your mother as well!"

Fantastic collection that you will enjoy.Have Fun!Todd HagopianPresident/CEOHagopian InstituteAuthor of the popular ""Quote Junkie"" book sereies and the brand new ""Idiom Junkie"" series"
5,SENSATIONAL! A stunningly sizzling historical,"Ms. Whiteside has done it again! With her exceptional talent and her flair for erotic and historical, she has combined both to bring a fabulous tale. Not a family member or a friend but a professional reviewer, I find this story has all the elements you want in a historical romance. Adventure,intrigue and of course hot steamy sex. This is a highly entertaining tale that you will not want to put down. KUDO'S TO YOU MS. Whiteside for another wonderful read."
1,No plot...lots of sex,"My friend knows I love historical western romance and told me to ""watch"" for this relativly new author. So I grabbed this book up at my last trip to the bookstore. I could not have been more disappointed! There is very little plot and I couldn't ""tune"" into the characters. At the risk of sounding like a prude...this book was more like reading porn. I didn't ""feel"" there was any relationship between Viola and William, except for the sex. Some of the sex was hard to believe considering the era...I mean really how many bachelors who came from Ireland to the west brought with them trunks of dildos? I would save your money and buy a novel from Lori Foster....there is much more to her novels!"
5,I will bless the lord,Listening to the album has truly been a blessing to me.It has helped me to grow spiritually.Track number 2 is really a blessing to me. It has helped me to realize the power of prayer and to actually spend more time in prayer inorder to be drawn closer to the Lord.Also the track He loves me still is an inspiration to me .It helps me to realize that amids what is happening in life God finds something in all of us and he loves us no matter what.Keep singing and ministering for the Lord and continue to win souls for the Lord.God Bless you in this new ministry that you have started.
4,Good but not Great,"This book showed Gangrel society like I always imagined it to be. I liked the character of Romona, but I thought that it didn't show why she had such a connection with Zhavon. The fight scene with Leopold was detailed and exciting, albeit a tad cheesy. All in all the book was good, but not as good as Fleming in the Blood Curse Trilogy."
2,Poor Book in a Great Series,"This book was dreadful. Not only were the main characters a bunch of simpering idiots, but the whole book lacked plot. Where was the cohesion from Books 1+2? Leopold sucks now as well"
5,Perfect For 7D,"When I take out my 7D camera, I immediately slip my hand through the wrist strap and my camera is secure and comfortable. When I'm done shooting, I put the camera back in the pack and the wrist straps tucks in nicely without taking up much room. Perfect."
3,"Average Martial Arts Action, Average Plot, Avergae Acting","Chick Norris' ""An Eye for An Eye"" followed ""The Octagon"" and while the fight scenes were not anywhere as good in this movie as the ninja crazed flick, it did bolster nice performances from Christopher Lee, Mako, and yes, Chuck Norris. Here Chuck begins to finally appear somewhat comfortable as an actor. Prof. Tanaka (the really big villain) looks intimidating, but the final fight scene between him and Chuck is very limited. Matter of fact, Chuck's fight scenes appear more in line with his character. He is as Mako asserts, a little sloppy at times, but believable as one tough cop."
3,Often like pulling teeth!,"Yes, Alina Adams can write a pacy yarn and the crash/survival/rescue scenes were terrific, as were the love scenes and almost anything with Amelia in it, but there were times (often) where Annie & Paul (especially Paul!) needed to take a good hard look at themselves! Such bright people - wouldn't you think that they might have taken a cue from history continually repeating itself & done something about their communication skills? Yep, it all turned out OK in the end but don't read this one if you are looking for a relaxing read (or a hero you can like).....or if you are from a services family - you may want to give Paul a hard shake in the hope that it might rattle some sense into his duty-bound/controlling skull!"
1,"DON'T BOTHER! Shoddy, bad design, and misrepresented . . . a real rip-off.","This thing is nothing more than a wood dowel with two rubber hand grips slid over each end. Because the hand grips are loose and can spin on the dowel, the thing doesn't even work right, especially with heavier weights (you're just turning the hand grips and the weight isn't rising).The nylon cord just has a small wood peg attached to it's end. It DOES NOT have a substantial-looking bar to hold the weight as the picture indicates (and which was also the reason I chose this model). The only way to attach a weight is to simply run the cord through the hole in the weight and tie it with a knot!And the price? The dowel, the grips, and the nylon cord couldn't have cost the ""manufacturer"" more than about one dollar. Some might call it ""premuim pricing."" I'd call it a rip."
2,get back,"true chris robinson has a great voice and is extremely charismatic but the problem is he is singing boring lifeless songs. he needs the rest of the crowes to breathe energy back into these tunes.Dude we know your in love but i mean how many love songs can you put on one album . Katie dear should of stayed in the couples bedroom while in the arms of love seems like a crowes song that would never make the final cut for an album. Chris""s voice is still strong but thats it , get back to the crowes again."
4,What a bargain!,"I took a chance on this recording despite the negative reviews posted here. I found the sonics to be no worse than one typically finds on ""captured"" live recordings, and the lead performances to be first-rate. Even though (like all Opera D'Oro recordings) no libretto is included, consider what you do get, especially the gorgeous timbre of early Pavarotti and a powerful characterisation of the vengeful jester, one of the great abused employees of Western art. This is a bargain set well worth owning. (It must be noted that the Duke's cabaletta of sorts ""Possente amor mi chiama,"" which occurs just before his Act II exit, is missing. It's short, but its absence will be jarring to those familiar with this opera.)"
1,You get what you pay for,I thought the price for this was too good to be true. It was. Not worth buying. Sound too poor to enjoy.
