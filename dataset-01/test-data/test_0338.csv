4,Good pump,Like it a lot it works good and really quiet doing the job just like it should it worts the money
1,"Good pump, but you could do better.","I purchased this Pentair pump because of good luck and longevity of the last similar Pentair pump I had. Hoping to get a similar run out of this pump but time will tell. As of now it is running quiet and strong.Now my complaint: The connection kit included with the pump had the wrong sized O-rings! Come on now, how much effort would it have taken to include the proper size? I installed with the kit and ended up cutting it out and doing a direct hookup because of leaks. This cost me money and time! The idea of the kit is to be able to change the pump in the future without redoing the plumbing. Now I don't have that option. My 1 star rating reflects this issue, which relates to my overall frustration, not necessarily the pump itself."
2,Cheap construction,"Cute design, but drop it once and it's done. It is awkward to turn the top to mix, and the printed recipes on the container fade."
3,Average,"Not a very sturdy product, but seems to do the trick. Plastic is a bit cheap, but overall I'm enjoying it."
1,Save your money...,"Besides the significant errors, the author(s) lack the depth of understanding and qualifications that the other Cisco Press authors typically have. Although the book was intentionally written as an overview, items are just ""glossed over"" so lightly that you will wonder why the book's titled ""DESIGNING Campus Networks"" (as designing the networks overviewed is completely out of the scope/expertise level of this book). The book is more like a ""by-salespersons/for-salespersons"" level book, not a design book. If you already have even moderate internetworking knowledge you will not only be bored, but also frustrated at errors at the fundamental level (scary!). This is not your typical Cisco Press quality/level book. CCIE candidates save your money...This will do you no good at all."
2,A classic movie to love and hate,"As much as I love movies by Miyazaki and the bunch at Ghibli Studios, Takahata's Grave of the Fireflies just didn't grab me. While the story may have had a deep meaning, I just couldn't enjoy the movie because I was annoyed by the two main characters! They were such brats! The movie was very depressing but it does a great job depicting civilian life during the wartime.The video quality was acceptable for such an old movie and fortunately, it was presented in its original widescreen format. The audio was also acceptable.Being a 2 disc release, there are plenty of extras. Tons of interviews and other production notes to keep you busy after the film.Recommended (at least rent or borrow it) because the film has such a great story that everyone has to watch it at least once."
1,no story line. no plot. just a depressing SLOW movie.,I read such good reviews on this anime movie and it was honestly such a drag to get through. Nothing happens in the story line. The main character is a selfish brat who literally kills his sister by starving her to death. I feel like a middle schooler created this story. SO DISAPPOINTED.
4,Be Prepared To Get Depressed!,"What a sad existence Seita and Setsuko endure. It is charming despite the ongoing negative circumstances throughout the movie, that this brother and sister duo manage to laugh, sing and play games between scenes. I love Setsuko's laugh. A very good movie, but be ready to not feel warm and fuzzy inside after this film comes to an end. You have been forewarned."
1,More a soap opera than a war story,"First I want to say that I like 99% of Anime and love Hayao Miyazaki films. But the more I think about this movie the less I like it.It is more about the weird conflict between a boy and his aunt and a country that seems filled with selfish people. I don't know about what Japan view of social charity was, but large parts of the town are untouched. At the end many people are acting like they have been on vacation rather than in a war. Why couldn't one of these families help? Would they let 4 year die even if the brother was a bit of a jerk?I could go on, but let me say I agree with several of the negative reviews. Overall the movie relies on too many convenient coincidences and characters that don't wash."
2,A possibly great movie ruined by english language dubbing,"I sought this movie based on the strong reviews and serious subject. But hearing an adult American's breathy baby talk *totally* broke the spell of reality that Setsuko needed. No emotions could sink in when the audio constantly rang false. I'm sure a subtitled version of this tragic story would have had a deep effect. Having real Japanese people from recent, desperate times running around sounding like Californians in a recording studio made me recoil in disgust."
5,"Very, very, very, very sad, but a delight to watch","This is one of those movies that probably makes everyone involved in its production feel like they've done something with their lives. A truly amazing piece of filemaking, it tells the tale of a young brother and sister who are orphaned and struggle to survive in wartime Japan. This is by far the saddest movie I've ever seen in my life, and you should make sure you're in the proper mood before watching it. While the story is very powerful, what makes this movie really amazing is the drawing and animation which are beautiful to watch regardless of what's happening. Particularly superb are the background scenes and the way they handle lighting. This movie is truly a great artistic achievement."
3,good but defective,"The movie was getting to a great part, when the DVD started to freak out on me. So it was a let down, I plan on getting a better copy soon, so I can finish watching the movie."
5,Here's one of a kind anime that will touch your heart......,"We all know what happened back in World War II, but we dont have any clue what really happen to those people who suffered and died. This story will open your eyes and show you what life is. this is a one of a kind anime classic you dont wanna miss! (warning! you dont want to check this out if your a cry baby!)"
3,I've Had Better,"The book is alright. I'm usually skeptical when I read bad reviews for Sandra Brown books because I like some of the ones that have gotten mediocre reviews. But this one is the real deal of boring slow-paced books. It felt flat all throughout. I found myself skipping through pages to the parts where the main characters are together. I almost NEVER do that! When I do, that's when I know the book is lacking. Not one of Brown's best, I'm afraid."
3,Temptation's Kiss,"I am a fan of Sandra Brown but I have to say this book disappointed me. It was OK, just OK. The romance was pretty implausable and filled with cliche. Not worth the 7.99 I paid for it and not really billed as an old romance genre that it is."
2,a yo yo read,"i don't know about this one. what man, in his right mind, would actually wait three years for a woman? why can't megan make up her mind about josh? does she want him or NOT? did she actually fall in love with him all those years ago after one little kiss? josh keeps telling her he loves her, but does he really KNOW her or has he just fallen for her beautiful bod? is this a relationship built on love or lust? these two characters can manage big business, but a real relationship? i have my doubts."
4,Good photos,Used in kindergarten class. Students could talk about freezing and thawing even though they don't see it in nature. Buy it.
5,Circuit Tester,This is a well made tester. Bulb will be easy to replace when the time comes. A good clip with a good length of wire. This replaced my 30+ year old tester.
4,Fun and Funny Light Reading,"This book is about a sort of private investigator, Thraxas, who has the typical bumbling traits of a comic detective, including a rude manner (more offensive than hard-bitten) and an obsession with beer and gambling. Together with his sometime sidekick Makri, an escaped gladiator from the Orc Pits who is the first female student to attend the Guild College who works as a chainmail bikini-wearing waitress at the local tavern the Avenging Axe and just so happens to be the best warrior in the entire city of Turai, they run around offending people and solving crimes.This is basically just fun comic fantasy, not epic or life-changing, but wonderful for anyone who likes the Hawk and Fisher series or Terry Pratchett's novels. I highly reccommend it."
4,Bra,"I seldom get pulled in by brand names and initally balked at the cost of this bra. I've since bought several more. Thankfully, with this one, there's zero chafing for me. That's not the case with others. The cross-over straps are padded which is perfect for long runs. Everything holds in place and there's no squishing or bouncing going on. The fabric wicks beautifully. If I were to redesign this bra I would bring the hook closure to the front instead of the back."
5,Magic Medical Tape,"I've used this stuff for years and swear by it.It's great with abdominal pad for bandaging large wounds.It's good for those hard to bandage areas (between toes, fingers, etc) because it's so flexible.We've also discovered it makes a wonderful clothing patch, if you've torn an article of clothing (even if it's a stretchy knit fabric like a t-shirt), you can slap a piece of medipore on the inside and it will hold for MONTHS of wear and trips through the washer and dryer... and if you ever decide to mend the item correctly? The medipore peels right off without leaving icky residue on the fabric."
2,I did not receive the one that ordered,"I order one type of credit card holder and received a different one. The one that was sent to me has the ID display, which was not my choice."
5,Interesting Movie.,Interesting movie but not what I expected but thought provoking and leaves you with a better understanding of violence and how it is propagated.
1,Run Away!,"Oh, boy. I have to say that I hated this movie. I couldn't believe how poor it was compared to the book. It's a shame because I really do enjoy the work of the actors. I appreciate artsy movies as much as the next guy who pretends to like artsy movies but there comes a point where something has to happen. The problem is that when it does 'happen' I just didn't care anymore.As my dad used to say while watching The Young Ones with me ""Why on God's good name....!"""
2,When Will It End?,"Have you ever watched a movie and got upset because you thought it was about to end, then were pleasantly surprised that it didn't end? Well..... you won't see that here. Unfortunately when you think the movie is ending, you are hoping that it does..... but it doesn't. It's like a bad energizer bunny and keeps going and going. Beautiful scenery doesn't even help this movie move along as there is minimal action and hardly any suspense to keep you on the edge of your seat. It takes too long to get into the ""meat"" of the movie and too long to fininsh it."
3,Confuzzled and conflicted,"While Damon does his a great in this role, his character is truly a disturbed and troubled individual. While there are good things about this movie such as the beautiful scenery and great sets, I couldn't escape the feeling that this criminal character was nothing if glorified by this movie.Although I've given this movie 3 stars, I wouldn't waste my time watching it again."
2,Talk about a letdown...,"With such an incredible cast, we thought: we can't lose watching this. Plus we'd heard so many good things. And really, the movie itself was pretty good. But the ending is just so lame...this film ends up being a total letdown."
4,Top-notch,"This movie made me laugh, and it was a good suspense movie.The scene where Tom is singing and dancing and Dickie catches him--who didn't laugh out loud at THAT? Also, I laughed at how Dickie carelessly referred to Tom when they first met. Dickie: Who? Marge: Tom Ripley.Besides that, this is a good serious movie too. It deserved acclaim for the excellent cast (Jude Law was amazing) and fine story."
2,Couldn't keep me interested...,"I don't know why. Usually, I love the psychological thriller type of movies, but this one I just couldn't stay interested in. Both Tom and Dickie just didn't seem real. Tom just walks up to Dickie on the beach, and then all of a sudden, their friends. Then they're fighting. Yes, I watched the entire thing, and no, nothing about the ending changed my opinion of the movie. I had trouble keeping my attention on this one. I suggest you avoid it."
3,"Acceptable, if under lenient expectations.","This is one of those ""off-mainstream"" movies. It deals with male homosexuality, self-confrontation and other lots of sensitive, cold issues. If the plot is more fast-paced and full of suspense, I think this really deserves 5 stars.But the thing is that I nearly fell asleep watching it. Boring, dull... I feel this movie is too long, perhaps if they shorten it and spice it up, this review will be more positive."
3,The Not Quite Convincing Mr. Ripley,"Great cast and a wonderful setting. A bit improbable of a plot. I never read the book, but my guess is the characters were more believable and their motives more developed. Overall though, I found it entertaining."
4,Cate Blanchett Shines,"In a small but crucial supporting role (which isn't in the book) Cate Blanchett shines as an insecure American heiress who has the misfortune to become involved with Ripley. Blanchett shows us this woman's fakeness and brittlenes, and yet she's so vulnerable and beautiful you forgive her. As David Letterman said about Blanchett, ""That may be the most attractive woman I've ever seen in my life."""
3,Where is Hitchcock when you need him?,"This film had the opportunity to take a Hitchcockian thriller and add social and psychological texture beyond the master's usual depth. It does a great job of dressing for the part: solid acting, smashing location shooting, good period and class detail, lush art design and costumes. Unfortunately, soggy pacing and editing do in the momentum. The director does not use the camera or other techniques to make Matt Damon's Ripley character grow from recognizably nice and nave to full blown creepy enigmatic, like Hitchcock would have. The Ripley character achieves what he wants too soon, so that too much time afterward is spent on what he does with what he has gained and will he get caught. Plot points and characters introduced after that point lack urgency. My husband fell asleep for several minutes in the last hour and when he awoke, I did not have to say much to bring him up to speed."
2,"Well done, but depressing dark movie","There are a lot of things to like about this movie, but unfortunately they are all superficial. First, the scenery is beautiful. 1950's Italy looks like an incredible place to live and provides a compelling backdrop for the actions of the characters. Second, all of the actors give great performances. Gwyneth Paltrow steals the show with her sympathetic performance. Blanchette and Hoffman are good and so is Damon as the evil Ripley. Law turns in a great performance as the victim of Damon's schemes. Then what is wrong about this movie? First, homosexuality is a big theme in this movie, which might turn some people off. Second, this is not a typical thriller so don't expect the typical good guy vs. bad guy ending. While the ending makes sense, it leaves a bad taste in your mouth. My advice is to know what to expect before you watch this movie. If you enjoy these kind of artsy movies then this is for you."
3,Jude Law is a great discovery!,"Jude Law totally steals the show in this thriller as Dickie Greenleaf, an American playboy living it up in Italy. His animal energy flies off the screen and his demise is way too early, leaving the rest of the film gasping in his shadow. Damon and Paltrow add good support and the story is always watchable, but the film completely belongs to Law. A must for armchair travellers, as the characters travel from Naples to Rome to San Remo to Vence."
2,is it over yet?,"I'm sorry. I usually like this type of movie. The idea was good. The plot was good. But what a dreadfully long, drawn-out movie! Exasurbating the fact that the scenes and dialog in them were slow was the fact that often the mumbled dialog was difficult to understand. The foreign dialog aside (I do not expect to understand Italian--this I can tolerate), I actually rewinded the tape to hear certain lines a second and third time to try to understand what they said, and still I couldn't make it out. I agree with my fellow reviewers that the cinematography was beautifully done, as was the soundtrack. I simply found myself squirming to go do something else about two-thirds through the movie. It's really too bad."
1,the WORST movie ever,"I regret those 2 houres that i spend from my life, I watch it at theatre 6 monthes ago, and I couldnt wrote anything about it because remembering it makes me feels sick, it it disgusting, BORING, with no aim or clear line, you never know what this film wants to tell you, FULL of faults and unsequenced actions, unconvinsing at all, I hated myself that I spended those 120 minute in this poor, very poor work...."
1,One of the worst movies i have ever seen,"I couldnt find words to express how disgusting I feel about that movie, very boring long, unconvient... you realy dont believe any of what happening, the actors were so bad, I dont know how to explain the suffer i feel while watching it."
2,Aaaaarrrrrrrggggggghhhhhhh!!!!!!,I forced myself to sit through this thing knowing that Tom Ripley would get caught and get his comeuppance in the end. Got caught. Didn't like comeuppance. What a waste of time!
3,Diversity of Life,"This book was good because it introduced new atmostpheres of the world and how different environments are structured. It analyzed the affects that an environment has on species. It also sets up hypothetical siuations that allow the read to think of ""what ifs."" Wilson gives examples that show thing from different perspectives, which is a positive aspect of the book. The only bad thing was that some of the book was ranting on. I felt that some things could have been said in a more consice way."
3,Interesting Third Book,"This book isn't my favorite in the Dark Tower Series, but it does have some very good qualities. The concept of Blaine the Mono is definitely intriguing. I also like it's attitude, and how that particular character, in some form, keeps recurring (if only in the other characters' analyses of artificial intelligence later in the series). I liked the idea of the ""test of wits,"" i.e. the logic puzzle, for the fate of Roland's Ka-Tet, but this has definitely been done before.I would have liked some more explanation of how the Tick-Tock man and the man in black are intertwined. The city of Lud also interested me greatly, and I would have really liked a little more exploration of this world."
3,getting to this one,"I haven't read it yet , but the book looks good, I cant wait to see how this is all going to end!"
2,Very mediocre,"I still love Roland and Jake, but Eddie and Susannah are annoying, stereotypical and shallow. It's like- Susannah is black, a woman AND disabled, so of course she's perfect, oh, and she and Eddie love one another so they must be deep, sensitive people. Also, King's influences were a little too blatant- Eliot's Wasteland was almost pushed onto the reader, and the riddle game was a Tolkien copy.And the cliffhanger? How do you THINK it's going to be resolved? Is anyone really worried that the first sentence of the next book is going to be, ""Blaine the mono would have smiled, had he a mouth, as he correctly answered the last riddle, seconds before hurling Roland and his party to their deaths. The end."""
1,Really diappointed!,Seriously the most STALE cashews that i've ever had. Don't know if i'm just unlucky but i'm really disappointed with the product. The cashews were NOT edible. It's a shame that the seller would still sell these cashews!
1,Not a very accurate history about the Moffatts!!,"I have read this book, and found that the book is not very well-researched about the four brothers from British Columbia, Canada known as ""The Moffatts"". I have been supporting (not just a fan of) the Moffatts since late 1994, when I first discovered their gifted talent of singing. I have also learn the history about them, (based on press kits, articles, and the real source, their dad.) Anyway, to the point: I have found many errors in the book that I know are not true about The Moffatts. And there alot of misspells, miswords, and misphrases. For instance, they did not sing ""What a Wonderful World"" by Louie Armstrong on their ""It's A Wonderful World"" Album. It was ""(What A) Wonderful World"" written by Cooke, Alpert, and Alder that they sang was also sung by Herman's Hermits. Totally different lyrics.So I am not giving this book a great rating."
5,Wonderful book for young adults AND adults,"When I was younger I read ISLAND OF THE BLUE DOLPHINS, and it became my favorite book of all time to this day. Never before have I found a novel to compare to that one, until now. Creel's powerful voice and storytelling make UNDER A STAND STILL MOON able to stand on the same shelf as that other classic. Don't miss it for yourself or your children."
1,Horrible,"I believe that this book is so poorly written, so incoherent, that tears well in my eyes about the waste of paper and trees."
5,A great debut novel and fascinating topic,I loved this book. The subject of cloning is difficult to approach but the author does it with ease. This is a well-written and thought provoking book. The level of scientific detail is fascinating and got me hooked right away. My book club read this book and we all agreed it was a wonderful book and so hard to put down! I found the details of the cybergame to be absolutely intriguing and disturbing at the same time.I would highly recommend this book and suggest it as a great book for book clubs as the subject matter of cloning make for a truly engaging and lively discussion. A great novel and I'll await his next book!
3,Weird,"I bought this movie with my friend the night we got Harry Potter. We love campy movies, and it was inexpensive. This is probably the weirdest movie I have ever seen. To start, I should mention I haven't been able to finish it yet. I can only handle it in small doses before I go out of my mind, but its not actually a bad movie. Upon reflection it is hilarious- but it can be a little hard to sit through. If you have the money to spare and are up for a weirdddd movie, I would recommend it, if only because I doubt there is one other movie out there like it...it's more of an experience than a movie."
4,Not for everybody,"This film isn't for everybody, but a select audience will find it hysterical. Production values are poor, but in this case, that is part of its charm. I tend to dislike alot of these independent films, but this is one I'll have to watch again. The dialogue is soooo funny, and the songs are outrageous. It makes me think a little of ""Rocky Horror Picture Show"", in that the story is outrageous and silly, and meant to be just that. The characters are such losers, but you can't help but love them. Again, this isn't for everyone, but if you liked ""Rocky Horror"", you might just get a kick out of this."
1,UNDER Construction is OVER rated,"I don't know why ppl like her, compared to other female mc's she has horrible lyrics. Have you listened to the lyrics on ""Work it"", she changes the subject every line. And all the production sounded the same on the album, all with that ""space age"" sound courtesy of Timbaland. She needs to stop trying to be original, and stick to the book."
1,definetely under construction,"Missy seemed to rush this in for the holidays with a measely 13 songs. First off the annoying ""this is a missy exclusive"" makes you want to throw the cd out of the window. Secondly missy should stick to rapping because her slow songs seem to be very bad. Thirdly what's with the stopping in between songs to talk to us? If we wanted an exclusive lecture from Missy we would look for you online.(Stick with the music.) There are only a couple of songs here that are worthwhile; bring the pain,work it,funky fresh dressed, and slide. Yes it's that bad. But if ur a Missy fan go out and get this piece of holiday garbage."
1,"oh gosh, missy elliot CANT SING","missy elliot is maybe the worst singer ever. After i heard it i got a headache for 3 hours. I didnt buy thank goodness, i barrowed it from my friend. dont buy this cd untill you hear it. It AWFUL."
1,Still Under Construction,"If you like funky cool beats then Missy is a exelent example cause he base her songs on beats. But for those who like some good lyrics and a catchy hook then you should listen to something else. Missy is alot about beats, she mostly makes cool videos too that are geting overplayed on MTV. But the lyrics and dull and hook...what hook? has she even made a song with a decent hook. Thing is Missy is neither such a good rapper or singer, that explains why she always have guest artists on her songs doesn't it? This album brings absolutely nothing new to the market, it's just repeating the same message that she's already sent before. This Album is still under construction and i doubt it will ever be finnished."
2,No good with bare feet,The chair itself is reasonably comfortable but the foot rest bar is in the way when getting in or out of the chair and is hard on bare feet. When the chair is reclined the foot rest bar is uncomfortable unless wearing shoes. I have had to end up using a separate footstool.Also the instructions say that the straps supporting the seat and back are not under warranty and should be replaced every two years! Thre is no mention as to how to obtain the new straps. I feel this information should be included in the product description. I would not buy another one.
1,Forest Green turned Blue,Ordered and received two Faulkner XL Forest Green recliners and after 2 weeks on the back deck they are now blue and no longer match our patio furniture.
2,Hooks broke after second use,"We purchased our Zip Net to secure a load on the interior of our SUV. First use was a bit difficult - making adjustments wasn't that easy. On the return trip, it was a bit easier to sort out since we had already used it. We then stored the Zip Net in the back of our SUV. It's been about a year since we used it, but today we pulled it out and three of the hooks broke. We were shocked that the hooks just snapped in half where they connect to the cords. Fortunately we didn't have the cargo net under a lot of tension when the breaks occurred."
4,"Burke Davis, my Grandfather writes great books.","Burke Davis is my grandfather on my mom's side. My mom, Angela Davis-Gardner, has written two books, ""Felice"" and ""Forms of Shelter"". Burke Davis has written 50 or more. I'm 14 now, but when I was about 7 I read Mr. Lincoln's Whiskers. I loved it! I have all of his books and this is the best children's one. I recommend this to see about another side of Abraham Lincoln"
3,trade paperback = quality ?,"....Others have covered the content, in that regard...I will only say: if you don't mind ""New Age"" stuff (ie. each interpretation ends with 4, 1-3 sentence notes: an ""Indication"", a Question, a Suggestion, and an Affirmation); it can be good fun. I enjoy it... Lot's of interesting positive ideas.......As regards the BOOK, the paper is cheap, and the illustrations are in black and white, many so fuzzy that important detail is lost. ( of course, this is not a problem if you have your deck out while reading). The text is about 1 page per card. This is an advantage for those who like quick results.....At the end are 7 spreads (including a relationship spread for 2 people to do together).Also a 1 page glossary of commonly occurring symbols, and 1 on finding ""your personal"" card. The book starts with 7-11 pages of introductory material on the use of the tarot. 3 stars because of the cheapness of the publisher: Weiser Books"
5,305 mm kick stand,This is a perfect replacement for my large frame bicycle. I tried a 285 mm kick stand but it was too short.
1,Poorly Designed,"I expected this kickstand to be great, given all of the positive reviews it has received. However, it unfortunately did not fit my bike. The kickstand itself has a thick part through which you are meant to screw it onto your bike, but its thickness in addition to the thickness of its corresponding part on my bike made it too thick for the bolt provided with my bike or the shorter bolt provided with the kickstand. I attempted to use the longer bolt, but was unable to get it securely fasted onto my bike, so it wobbled back and forth. Additionally, the ""instructions"" provided with it were vague and unhelpful. Maybe it is simply inappropriately designed for my specific bike, but overall I am extremely dissatisfied.Pros:* Seems durable* Height easily adjustable with a hacksaw* Good lookingCons:* Unhelpful instructions* Too thick for its own bolts* Did not fit securely on my bike"
1,Greenfield bicycle kickstand damages frame,"This seems to be a well-made and sturdy product, but it is not for use on aluminum or carbon frames. The clamping pressure and the small protrusions on the clamping surface will dent aluminum and damage the paint. Both happened to my bike. Damage to carbon seems even more likely. A steel frame might escape damage from clamping, but it seems likely that the paint would still be damaged."
4,"Mounts on center of frame, not rear","Maybe I over looked the description of this product but I was looking for a kickstand that mounted on the rear of my bike frame. When I received the product, it mounted in the center of the frame (behind pedal mount). Be careful in ordering so you don't obstruct pedaling if you specifically need a rear-mounted stand. Product is very solid and provides good support mounted in the center."
5,Perfect,"I just rec'd and attached the kickstand on my 2012 Trek 7.5 FX; I ordered the 285 mm for my 15"" bike. It did not come with instructions but I was able to figure it out in just 2 tries. The short screw goes on top and the attached stand bar goes sideways. No scratches, no issues. It fits perfectly and works like a charm. It is well constructed and discreet on my bike. I am very pleased and recommend it.I would have attached 2 photos but was not given the option."
2,Arthur's Perfect Christmas,"Marc Brown's Arthur is very popular with young people. It is usually well written. However, I found Arthur's Christmas lacking. I thought at first a page was missing. The story did not flow well and felt like he was trying to cram everything about the winter holiday season into a 32 page book. I found it much too busy. It seemed rushed and not well thought out."
1,Buyer Beware: These are not Ruth Draper recordings,This CD is by a contemporary actress doing her own version Draper.
4,Teacning Children with Autism How to Mind Read,The book is fantastic way to teach the basic theory of mind. The picture of the stories enable the child to understand the different emotions and their triggers.My son loves the book.
5,From a Latino Financial Planner,"The Latino Journey to Financial Greatness is an extraordinary and groundbraking piece of work. This book is by far the most insteresting and inspirational of all the Latino financial books so far written. Believe me! I have read them all. It is a true road map in finding financial and personal greatness. As Barajas writes"" the why is more important than the how"". It is practical and fun to read. As a Financial Planner, I have seen many of the cultural barriers that Bajaras points out with my clients. I have used the 10 steps with my clients and they all found the process motiving and inspiring. This book is a must read for all the financial consultants that wish to serve the Latino market."
1,Offensive for young readers,"My child as well checked this book out from the school library. I can't imagine why I have to discuss the Devil and Voodoo and Cursing Mummies with a 5 YO. Now he is too embarrassed to say to his teacher that his mom is upset with this book, and I am stuck to read this trash with him and let him look at the disturbing, racy illustrations. ZERO stars and YUK factor."
5,A classic-to-be in the horror genre,"This is another book review by Wolfie and Kansas, the boonie dogs from Toto, Guam. Human reviewers seem to have trouble placing the stories in Brad Watson's ""Last Days of the Dog-Men"" in the proper genre, describing these little gems as literary fiction. To dogs, however, these stories belong in the horror genre. In practically every story, a dog is murdered. From a canine viewpoint, these stories are what we would expect from Edgar Allen Poe if he had decided to use dogs as victims in his stories.Watson's treatment of his canine characters is surprisingly good for a human author. Our only complaint is that he nonetheless spends more time developing his human characters. While he handles them well, they are intrinsically less interesting than dogs. Perhaps in his next collection, Watson will dispense with the noncanine animals of primate derivation and focus exclusively on dogs"
4,Very Pleased,Excellent quality! Very sturdy. My only complaint is that it did not include inflation instructions for the ball and we had to call several customer service numbers to confirm the proper way to inflate the ball.
5,super easy to use,This is the second exercise ball I have had and this one is great. The size works perfect for me.
1,Shipping ripoff,"I didn't buy this ball because I read other reviews that say that the ball arrives in a small envelope and yet they are trying to charge me $14 for shipping it. Seems ridiculous, even though this one seemed like the best choice for the money."
2,Shaped like an egg,"Aside from not popping so far, this ball has little to recommend it. First, it's not so much a ball as it is an egg -- its long diameter is a few inches more than its shortest diameter. Second, it's surface is slicker than other brands, making it difficult to use it in ways that depend on surface friction. Fortunately, I bought another brand and have happily switched. You should avoid that detour. Move on -- unless a slippery, egg-shaped ball is just what you're looking for."
3,Parka,"This parka appears to be a good coat for the price,but the buttons are loose and need to be checked before first use. The sizes are very large.When ordering you probably need to order at least one size smaller than you normally wear, possibly two. The coat is very warm and should serve your needs."
3,WAY too BIG!,"A Big-Bodied coat. Bought this for my son, and according to their sizing chart he would be a large, with chest of 41-45"" The coat that showed up had a 57"" chest, I kid you not! So after the drama and cost of return I wound up buying him the same company's Armory Knox in a SMALL- and it even swims a bit. The co. I bought the this UF N3B from said I must've gotten a defect or a mis-marked coat, but it is the sizing chart through the main company that is wrong. The small we received from same company had atleast a 45"" chest on it. Beautiful colors though, and they do keep you nice and toasty if you can manage to find the right size. But expect to send the coat you ordered back for a much smaller one, and expect them to not know the sizing chart you are making your decisions from is completely wrong......"
3,Unfortunately weak......,"I love Castlevania I'm a huge fan of the series and when I saw this I knew I had to own it. Well after reading it, I wish I hadn't bought it. As a fan of the games it's nice to have in the collection, as a comic book fan it shouldn't be in my collection."
5,Big Brother to call,"Dee Henderson gives such great insight of her characters that you can literally feel the individuals that she writes about. I could see my protective, yet understanding big brothers in my head. All I could do was smile at my own memories. Dee is awesome."
3,Bratz Camp Fire Tent Review,It is difficult for me to do a review of a toy that was purchased for a grandchild.
3,Maybe not Drummer's 'Bible'...,"This book is pretty good at introducing the student to a variety of drumming styles and techniques. Where it falls short though is that it doesn't really go into much detail on any particular style, and the accompanying CD includes certain examples that are played so fast (and with less than fantastic production), that it's hard to follow along. It would have been better if they played the examples at a variety of tempos to allow the student to more accurately discern the voices and nuances of the rhythm.That being said, the book is probably what it is meant to be - a brief overview and taste of many different styles - not intended to provide in depth analysis of any particular style.""Was this review helpful to you?"" I can answer that question. ""No."""
5,Every Drummer NEEDS This Book,"If you don't have it, it's your loss. I've used this book to learn several Afro-Cuban grooves so far and it's very, very well done. Each style is clearly explained and written. Combine that with the CDs and it's the perfect way to dig into a new style of drumming."
5,Excellent book for Mid-level Drummers,"This book is excellent for exposing the student to many different rhythms while still giving them a chance to develop their own style. By giving written directions and history, this book still leaves some up to interpretation. When it says everything from afro-cuban to Zydeco, it is no exaggeration. This book has it all. The accompaniment tracks give an audible feel to the written direction and rhythm. I would recommend this book to any mid-level to slightly advanced student. Two thumbs up!"
3,Why did they leave out some music !,I also noticed that there was music missing from this episode and I found this very annoying. I hope paramount will redo this episode and put all of the music back in !
2,This is NOT Plan 9,"However if you enjoy 80's low budget, bad hair, mexi-horror this is a gem. Cemetery of Terror is about a group of mulleted men who steal a corpse and resurrect it with the devil's spirit to possibly get carnal with their dates. Of course the possessed corpse kills them all by splattering fake blood on them. Brave kids wearing Michael Jackson jackets appear to save the day"
1,Revision did not catch the demise of the USSR,"This book has on the cover: Fourth edition, fully revised and updated. On the title page verso: First American edition published 2001 by Interlink Books. On p. vii ""The USSR is the largest country on the globe ..."" (repeated on p. 2) P. 1 has: ""... what we now know as the USSR.""An earlier edition will probably suit you as well as this one."
2,Predictable and boring...,"I am a Drop Dead Diva fan. I also enjoyed Legally Blonde. This however, I could have slept through. Even at free, it wasn't really worth the time."
2,Kirby Bag,"The picture of the Kirby online look just like the one's I have, but when I received the bags this were not the case. The original bags that come with vacuum cleaner are made of cloth the bags. The bags I received are made from paper."
4,This hair gel is ok...,"It's got a decent hold, but 9 times out of 10, I find my head up someone's ass.....Go figure. Thanks."
1,*Sigh*,"If you're familiar with the Batman Begins line...you'll have already seen this toy.It's the same thing actually, name and all. Very disappointing to see something like this rehashed for Bionicle, which has always been a pretty interesting and original line."
2,lost civilization found,"Interesting trash reading with the normal racist overtones of the period. The Colonel restrains himself from the more blatant attitudes toward race and class he shows in the sequel, Troyana. These books should be read in succession for a revealing look at the writer, best known for his books about dogs."
2,I regret purchasing it,"I bought it because I went through a couple weeks of feeling down. Once I was fine again I went ""wow. why did I buy that?"" and tried to cancel. They ignored my email (sent 3 days before canceling) then the second it sent I got a response ""Sorry, we already sent it"". Now I can't get ahold of them to send it back! UGH!"
1,Not For Me,"This book came to me highly recommended by a good source with whom I hate to disagree; however, I found that the author spends too much time concentrating on the negative aspects of life and not enough time talking about the positive. I can't speak for others; but, as for me, this would never work."
5,Almost too beautiful for words,"This disc combines the best musical characteristics of Willi Boskovsky (Cream Puffs, Bonbons, etc), Ensemble Wien (A Vienna Souvenir)and The Tanzquartett Wien (Dance Music From Old Vienna). The selection of songs is superb, the arrangements are out of this world, especially the tracts with flute and guitar, and the performances perfect. The sound quality of the recording is masterful. I couldn't recommend it highly enough, and it is a bargain to boot. If you enjoy beautiful Viennese dance music, don't pass up this one."
3,Everything You Ever Wanted to Know about Bing,"This is incredibly engrossing and complete. If a reader wants to know everything about where Bing Crosby came from and what he became, this is the book to read."
5,Sony-recorder.,"This Sony was the walkman to iPod crossover.Music could be put on disks and saved or recorded over.Worked very good for meetings, school, etc.."
4,My thoughts,"This CD contains both the single and video , nothing more , I bought this CD to replace my lost copy , I recamend this CD to any one who has never heard of Filter or seen the Take A Picture Video , otherwise skip this CD, and buy the single or Video on Itunes"
4,deciphering the lyrics,"For all those who are confused about the lyrics it goes 'awake on my airplane ....my skin is bare ....' Its actually about him (filter lead singer) being drunk on an aeroplane and having people take a picture because he wont remember! I heard this somewhere but please correct me if u think its something else! I used to think it was about him as a child (it makes sense- newsborns, what do ypu think about your son now..)The new interpretation makes sense though if you think about it.By the way, he feels like a newborn because his skin is bare and he's shaking and screaming!( due to being intoxicated)Whatever the lyrics are, its a really catchy tune- quite a bit different than a lot of their other songs- And 1000 times better. If anyone has the full album could they say whether the songs are as good as 'Take a picture', cos this is really catchy stuff"
5,to all you people who don't understand the lyrics,"from personal experiences, i know that whenever there's a song i like, i go on the net and find the lyrics to it. the net never fails to find them. if you don't understand or want to know the lyrics or just curious, look for the lyrics on the net- and later, it helps you to appreciate the music more."
1,"I hate this horrible, terrible song","I really would like to say that I love Filter's first mainstream pop hit, but I despise it so much. It sounds atrocious, and it's the same thing over and over and over and over again. People who heard this on soft-alt stations are gonna buy the CD for this, and get bombarded by fast cuts like Welcome to the Fold. I actually like those fast ones from Filter, and i suggest anyone who might think of buying Title of Record for this song to just by the single (if you actually like this piece of monkey @$##%)."
3,Beautiful lamp,"The lamp itself is lovely and the prompt shipment was very good. I have actually bought from them over the phone and had it shipped here before, so felt comfortable buying from them on line. I am a little disappointed in the actual quality of the product. When my husband and I put it together, a couple small parts were missing and there was a huge amount of electrical cord. My husband has been in construction for 35 years, so he did know what he was doing. It is a lovely piece of furniture, but I would like them to know the quality of the actual parts could use some upgrade.Thanks."
4,This is the live stuff we've waited for,"Being able to hear multiple nights of a live show brings the real depth of these musicians. These songs are all unique - no redundency here. I've heard K.C. live 12 times from 80 on, and this gives me those earlier moments that brought forth the next 2 incarnations that have led them to the ability of pure experimentation at the level of complete song structure - something not touched by anyone else in the rock world. And I even got J.W. to sign mine - way cool."
1,Useless - Designed Too Small,"Very poor design. Having been excited to receive this product, I was disappointed in the poor design and had to use a magnifier to see it while I worked. The connecting ring was just too small and flimsy, and I had to pry the wires apart with a letter opener which left the ring bent open. Then after I finally got the ring on the broken zipper part, I had to use pliers to close it and it did not close properly as the wires are just too small and fragile. My husband tried installing the second one and he was unsuccessful for the same reasons. I ended up throwing both away. I am now going to purchase another style that costs more but snaps into place and is sturdier."
5,Bueno,This is an awesome book. It was required for my class. It is easy to understand with definitions in the back and english to spanish translation in the back as well.
4,seems legit...,"Book arrived really quickly, and in pretty good condition. It met my expectations and did what I thought I needed it to do, turns out I didn't even need it, I don't think I've cracked it open once for my Spanish class, but if I do need it, I know it's there."
1,Horrible,"This is a terrible book, but it's required for our classes. No way around it. The series ""Practice Makes Perfect"" are good books if your serious about learning Spanish."
1,just half a star...,"The book had a great price but the neccessary CD was missing.I had to spent $130.00 for internet use of the missing CD, plus the price of the book.The book purchase was certainly not worth it!I had to give one star for the review because a half a star was not available."
2,Used Books Don't Have CODES!!!!,"To be fair, my professor told me to buy this book new from the bookstore or the publisher but I just figured she was in the pocket of the bookstore and wanted me to give my money to the school... turns out she was right because after I bought this book on here for about $90 (I thought I was getting a killer deal) I found out that I still needed to buy the online code for $119... buying the book used COST ME MORE MONEY!!!! You need the online code because that's where all of the homework is and where all of the resources are so my suggestion would be to just buy the NEW package from your school's bookstore or the publisher from the get go!! Don't be fooled into thinking you're getting a deal buying used!"
1,Shameful Publisher and College Scam,"Of course you have to buy it new. A shameful way for colleges, publishers and authors to rake poor college students over the coals. Funk Blanco/Donley. Motherfunk Vista Higher Learning. and funk the colleges that use this book. Blanco, you're a bad person. You should be ashamed to put your name on this scam. Crook."
3,Worn down.,"I recieved the book in a very impressive time... I was shocked to see the state of the book though. The book, of cousre, is still useable but it is kind of falling apart. The binding is very weak and the corners of the cover are bent... Just not what I expected."
1,Not a good choice,This product said that it was new and when I recieved it the book was bent down the middle horrible wear on the edges and the code that was needed had already been used. I sent the book back about a month ago and still have NOT recieved my refund.
5,Very good quality flute,"I've had this flute for more than a three months now and it is still holding up. In the past three months i've been learning how to play the flute and i already good at it. Even my friend in orchestra(in middle school) says that i might be better than her. The only problem is that something off the flute, but i think that was my fault because i kept on using it. This is a good instrument for anyone that wants to learn the flute. This flute is a good, and lightweight instrument. I recommend this instrument to anyone."
5,A Great RPG!,"One of the best martial arts/sci-fi RPGs out there. Great on its own, and awesome as a supplement to the rest of the Palladium Megaverse (16 character classes, 41 martial arts systems, cybernetic augmentation, plus a lot more). A great RPG."
5,iPod is No Competition to the iRiver,"I did *tons* of research on MP3 players before I bought the iHP-100. Clearly it and the 20 gig iHP-120 are the best players on the market right now, followed by the iPod.Pros:- 16 hours of battery life (3G iPod's get 8 hours)- Same size as the iPod and smaller than Zen- *NO SOFTWARE REQUIRED TO ADD MUSIC TO THE PLAYER* almost no MP3 players have this capability. You plug the iRiver into any USB port and you can drop music or files onto the drive. That's it. No installing extra software, nothing. iPod and Zens both need extra software to function- LCD remote control included (extra on the iPod)- FM radio (extra on the iPod)- Simple interface- Digital recording (and digital output)- Active support and updates from iRiver, they just added OGG music file format support, one of the few players that can play OGG filesCons: price, it's not the cheapest player on the market, but I think you get what you pay for here"
5,Great soup mix--try it!,"Seitenbacher is a fabulous soup mix! One canister makes 40 cups of broth, which makes it incredibly inexpensive. It's also delicious. It makes a truly versatile soup base. People love my nabeyakiudon (Japanese noodle soup), matzoah ball soup (Jewish dumpling soup), golden lentil stew (Indian bean stew), all of which have Seitenbacher as the base. It works for people with allergies and food sensitivities (no gluten, no lactose, no MSG, no soy). It's all natural and vegetarian (no gelatin). And I can't emphasize enough the rich, deep flavor."
3,Seitenbacher Vegetable Broth,This is a good product especially since the Broth contains No oil. The broth would be a Great product if Seitenbacher made an Organic version of their Broth with No oil
5,skin-saver,"I work with a LOT of machines and this software has saved a number of people's behinds when their drives got corrupted or began to fail. (It makes me look good too)There's now a downloadable update to version 4.4 to make the program run properly in Lion.If you work with a lot of macs, GET THIS. It works on disk images, will help even when a file system check won't, and I've also used it to recover files from drives that were failing and badly clicking."
1,Too much fluff,"I enjoyed Stanley's book The Millionaire Next Door tremendously, but in this one it looks like he took a couple dozen pages worth of material, and then took it and stretched it, using imaginairy conversations, multiple charts and profiles, and various other means to get it to book length. First I read, then I skimmed, finally I just checked the table of contents to see if there might be anything worth reading.Not worth your time - good thing I got it from the library."
3,weak,"While I loved the millionaire next and was eagerly anticipating this release I had a strong sense while reading this book that perhaps the author was under the gun to meet a deadline. What could he ever have possibly been thinking to dedicate a whole chapter to a man with dyslexia (perhaps in the author's mind a handicapped man somehow equals a woman...Argggh!) Even more disappointing were the many charts regarding small business opportunities. In my opinion, they would have had much more pertinence to the reader-(and the supposed subject matter of the book) if they were WOMAN OWNED businesses. There are some interesting cases but all and all I was not impressed for the above reasons."
4,"Dated, but really useful","Oh, the Potty Book. My daughter loves it so. She's nowhere near being ready to sit on the potty herself, but she loves to read about it. This book seriously needs some updating. It features a pretty white girl named Steffie who lives in a *house*, and a handsome African-American boy named Ben who lives in an *apartment*. Um, stereotypes anyone? Other than that, I love that this book features photos rather than drawings, and that it covers the entire transition from diapers to underpants. Although at the end of the book, neither kid is fully potty trained. And hey, we ALL end up in diapers again eventually, right?This book is pretty funny too - I haven't been able to read the line that goes ""Steffie's bear, Muffin sat on the potty too"" without laughing yet. The paperback book is plenty sturdy. I'd give it five stars if not for the undercurrent of race-based socioeconomic disparities throughout."
4,it was good,"This was a good solid book. You learned a lot about strength training and different methods to go about it. The only weakness was that it was complicated to learn everything, and you need to have a lot of patience to finish it."
1,Very Religious Book!,"I did not realize that this book was aimed at Christian married couples. I read the first few reviews of it on Amazon, but I should have read further down.I think that some of the content is decent, but disagreed with the authors in a few ares - such as where they say porn is forbidden, and they also bash abortion in the first chapter...I'm not sure why that's necessary in a book promoting better sex between married couples. Lastly I found it distracting that God was literally referenced on just about every page, along with bible passages and talks of much prayer.The final straw was when the authors suggested praying outloud to God when the love-making is over but while your husband is still inside of you. Em...no thanks, I'm good."
4,Not Monkeeing around,"This album made me a believer. In fact I use it as a stepping stone occassionally. I had never even heard of the Monkees before I bought this album and now I love them.Or This is just a greatest hits album and it was on sale and I felt like buying it. If you like the Monkees, you will like this album."
2,I'm Not A Believer,"Is it just me, or is there anybody who thinks this latest Monkee package from Rhino is harsh, shrill, and distorted on many of the tracks? I thought maybe my disc was a bad pressing and returned it in exchange. Nope. I have to say the Listen To The Band box set retains more of the original warmth of these recordings. As for the Bonus Karaoke disc, this is worth the price alone. It's a shame though that instead of the umpteenth ""remastering"" of the Monkees catalog, Rhino should give us a discs worth of the Backing Tracks. These are in superb fidleity."
1,UGH!,"I couldn't wait to buy this CD and boy do I regret it now. I was 7 when I first heard The Monkees and had a couple of their albums. Vinyl records are more memorable than this! In the Theme song it seemed muted. Last Train to Clarksville was what I remembered. I hated the few songs that Davey Jones sang on and Mike Nesmith is just too country. Spare your eardrums the monstrosity of Auntie Grizelda. Peter Tork sings flat and out of tune. I hate it now as much as I did when I was a kid. Some of the songs I never even heard of. There's also a Bonus Karaokee disk. Now I've Karaokee'd and I'm good, but this disk makes even me sound bad, and that takes some doing. All in all it's an UGH for me. After 2 plays I had to give it up. The Monkees, at least from my point of view, who was around when they first came out and used to sing with their albums should stay in the 60's where they belong. The Best of the Monkees? I have one word for that. NOT!"
5,Complete collection,"Bought this for my son, who is a huge Stooges fan. This is a complete collection - bought it for a great price on Amazon, when the price was lowered for a few days. Great value!"
4,Squeeze Ease,These are fantastic. I got a bunch and gave them to my friends. They are also very impressed. Great stocking fillers and great value!!!!
4,Works Just Fine,This fits a regular large tube of toothpaste and works as stated. It's a good reminder to my family to keep the toothpaste tube neat and tidy.
4,jen durkin is a surprise,"im not sure what to expect with post -GD incarnations, but after a slow start this dvd has some good songs..i give a positive review for jen durkin who does an amazing job on the song 7 seconds..and she is attractive with good energy too...mike gordon on bass does a good job too, but neither mike or steve kimock really stretch out too much..trippy graphics accompany the songs, but theyre arent too heavy and dont take away from the music..all songs but 1 or 2 are new robert hunter colaborations..the packaging is well done as well..check it out for yourself!"
4,Updated review,"When I first recieved this product, it didn't seem to accept a charge. However, upon READING the instructions in the camera book, and using the patience required, they charged up and work as designed. Great product at a very low price. These batteries are made in China, so hope they last a little while."
5,A Must Read Book,"Rarely does a collection of short stories come along in which each one of them is a gem! Fahy has captured the essence of ordinary life in Maine with extraordinarily brilliant glimpses into places and personalities. ""Detour"" is a masterpiece. ""Limerock"" should be in the collection of everyone who appreciates great literature."
2,Beware...potent stuff,I felt horrible for hours after i took just 1 cap. Nothing bad to say about Swanson products because this is some really potent stuff. I dont think ive ever felt so strung out after taking a supplement or drug. The side effects are just insane. Its like a bad lsd trip with a bunch of caffeine. I did notice a significant sexual boost but due to the side effects it's not even worth it.
5,Christmas Holiday lights,I purchased these in AUGUST of 2007. They were exactly what I WANTED. Unfortunately I broke the RED one during the 2009/2010 season. I want to replace it but evidently AMAZON'S source has dried up. Hopefully someone will read this review and let me know where I can get more.
4,a good read,"I have enjoyed many of Catherine Coulter's books, but this was one of my favourites. I think that this is because I feel kudos should be given to her because she manages to write a good romance in which the two main characters don't hate each other (one of the main requirements for your generic romance novel) and have other barriers in their way.I thought the resolution of the mystery at the end was a bit on the disappointing side, so don't expect anyhitng amazing in that area.Overall though, it is a good and entertaining read, I didn't even think that the amount of sex was a problem. I usually just skim those parts anyway, there is very little that can be done that is new in that area anyway. I didn't find that they detract from the actual story though. I recommend this for an enjoyable romance and an interesting plot of adventure."
1,The Courtship,"This book, like ""Mad Jack"", does not live up to the ""Sherbrook"" series. It's stilted and has no true plot. The opening scene was very promising, but after that it became boring."
1,the Courtship,If looked as a parady of some other books it was some whatamusing. But very heavy handed.
1,HORRIBLE!,"This is the first book I have read by this author and I hated it. With a plot that is as exciting as oatmeal (heavy, bland, and yes, slighty revolting) and characters so shallow they could drown in a teaspoonful of water, this book is one of the worst that I have read so far. My advice, unless you are a die hard fan, don't bother. Just wait until it is in your local library."
3,A solid 3 star - but I really think only Coulter lovers will like!,"This one was just ok - actually the sex might have been one of the best parts of the book. This couple Helen and Spenser truly seemed hot for each other and I enjoy a good hot romance once in awhile so that was the good part. It kinda made one of my favorite couples seem a little goofy though Douglas and Alexandria - I don't know they seemed a little trite and simple in this book, not nearly as compelling as in their own story. The mystery of the lamp, well it just did not do much for me, thus only 3 stars. Truly if you are a Coulter lover and enjoy her historical romances you should read this to complete the picture, but perhaps if you do not enjoy her books thoroughly you might want to skip this one."
1,How did this even get published?,"This is awful. I've never read another book by this author and after this I never will. The characters were annoying and way too modern, the dialogue was obnoxious, the plot was barely there and it took forever to begin. Oh and for some reason Lord Beecham kept referring the the heroine as the ""big girl"" which not only sounds unattractive but gets really annoying, really fast. Save your time and money and avoid this book like the plague!"
2,The Courtship,There is always a first for everything. I have always enjoyed Ms. Coulter's books but this book was a sleeper. The characters were flat and I didn't care whether they found love or not. The discipline sideline was laughable and completely boring. The whole treasure plot was downplayed and that is what we have come to expect from this series of books. Please put the romance back into your books and characters that you can care about too. Give this one a pass.
5,Tough,"I needed a chunky, movable, power strip in the middle of my listening room where I could plug in the amp, CD, laptop, fan, and iPod. Very pleased with the metal housing, and long thick(1/4 inch)cord. I have a Belkin for A/V stuff in the living room, but you can throw this road-ready unit around and know it won't get damaged. Sweet price too.10/14/12: Just bought another one of these for the music room to plug in the modem, phone, lamps. The 15ft cord is really a great feature. I have a crappy old power strip with a 3ft cord that practically hangs from the spare outlet. Best price for this is on Amazon."
5,Heavy duty strip,I like this strip a lot. Seems to be very well built. We'll see how it holds up over time.
5,Another Great Hellraiser Film!,"Love that it was filmed in nearby Denver, love the story, the effects, the Cenobites! Loved everything about this movie!"
2,"Beware when a movie open with ""Based On"".....","In the beggining of the movie, it states ""Based On ...Clive Barker"". This is the sure sign that a movie is so bad, that the originator does not want to be involved, case closed. All in all, it was a fair ""3 Star"" movie. However, billing this as ""Hellraiser"" is just plain wrong (and yes I am a fan of I & II) p----- me off and therefore the ""2 Star"" rating. It was an intelligent and creative concept, but it left me very dissapointed."
1,Stick a fork in Hellraiser!,"Junk. Pure junk. Don't even insult your intelligence by seeing this steaming pile of dump. I love Clive Barker. He has nothing to do with this junk. The plot is stupid. Pinhead makes a cameo that lasts about five minutes tops. This one might just kill the Hellraiser dynasty. I liked all of the previous Hellraisers, including Bloodline, but this one made me want to commit suicide. (...)"
4,Entertaining Set of music,"I believe when I got this I was looking for something hard drum & bass-ish as a soundtrack to ride my bicycle around town at night to.We'll this is not hard that's for sure, but I always enjoy listening to this 2 cd set. More vocals than I'd like (but I would rather hear someone screaming their point, ie: punk rock, then hear the next version of Celene Dion) and it seems like music to lounge to, but it isn't music that makes you want to fall asleep to either. It's nice to have this in my collection...a good one to put on for a dinner with a date (or friends)...the sounds are always entertaining."
5,GREAT BOOK!!!,"This is such a great book! It brought back so many memories... I have been a fan for atleast 5 years! I have gotten to meet them a few times, and everything. So this book just brought back so many memories! The pictures are so cool, and I thought I could'nt know any more about them than I already did! I know so much about them! And I learned stuff by raeding this! I reccomend it to ANY fan, new or old. Or anyone who is just curious!"
2,Dart Throw Line,"Ordered a bud light and a bud throw line, instead received a bud light and a generic throw line. Not at all what was ordered and confirmed via email. Obviously, this seller does not pay attention to his product shipping. Very disappointed but not worth the hassle/expense of returning. You expect something as small as this (and not expensive) to be handled right. This is a problem with computer ordering an inexpensive product that if wrong is not worth the time of hassling with to make right."
1,Not very helpful,"I can see that this book would be a nice little reference for designers or students of design. However, it is obviously aimed at the rest of us who are simply decorating our apartments or homes. For that broader audience of ordinary people, this book is not very helpful. I agree with the reviewer who said this is a dictionary or encyclopedia but not a decorating book. There is no help or advice here. The book is filled with one design term after another with little definitions. Frankly, I don't care about that information and find it worthless, to be honest."
4,Talk the talk,"I just picked up the Pocket Decorator after reading about it in House Beautiful. This guide I feel perfectly arms me with the vocabulary to discuss and weigh my options in fixing up our old townhouse. The Pocket Decorator addresses every aspect of a decorating job explaining all possible choices for each area- floors, lighting etc. It may not tell you how to decorate but instead informs you to make your own educated decorating and design decisions and allows you to articulate those decisions with any decorator, contractor or salesperson you may encounter along the way. Very handy."
2,rachmaninov imitator,I didn't like this CD. Medtner's piano concertoes sound like Rachmaninov's with all the interesting parts taken out. Demidenko gives it his all though.
5,WONDERFULL!,Good ol' Mike L. did a GREAT job on this book. It's written wonderfully. I only have two complaints:1. I had planned on having a book to read for a while. This one got me so involved I finished it in three days! *laughs*2. At the end there is an 'alternative ending'. Does this mean he isn't sure which one he is going to use? Or did he put the other one in just to show us what the other one is? *confused???*Wonderful job! I loved it!It was a fun read!-KK
1,Save your money!!,"This machine only lasted a few months and know the DVD player constantly freezes. I tried cleaning it, but it still constantly freezes to the point that watching the movie is impossible."
2,absolutely different toy,"The one that I got came with a cheap clear plastic bag, just one outfit in dark blue, and a bottle instead of a rattle. I'm returning it mainly because of a bag - it's not pretty at all. Please update your picture!"
1,The Real Tragedy,"The real tragedy was that this book was published at all! Amateurish dialogue, terrible plot (at least I think there's one) that goes nowhere, totally unbelievable characters without reason for being in the book who disappear after initial introductions, descriptions that are cliches of cliches, and threads that lead into thin air. I do not recommend this book and would give it -10 stars if that were possible."
5,Love this book,We love this book - both myself and my 2-year-old son. I love the sweet words and pictures about having a fun day and the quiet but thoughtful reminders to thank God for all the great things about the day. Would definitely recommended this book!
3,Inexpensive replacement part.,"I was glad to find this economical wall charger for my LG phone, after I left the original in a hotel room. It arrived in a few days. It works as well as the original, although the plug part is a little flimsy. For the price, a good value."
5,Great Leon Lai Movie,just get it. it's so emotional between a father and son. Guy tries to get girl. Wonderful film. To bad it's vbeen discontinued in the market on DVD.
5,Does this DVD come with Chinese subtitles?,I've been looking for this DVD for a very very long time!It seems to be out of print everywhere around Asia.I'd like to know if this DVD comes with Chinese subtitles though?And what audio tracks does it include? Cantonese or Mandarin?Thanx for answering!
1,It's not even worth this 1 star...,"This single sucks! it's not even worth 1 star. I only gave it one star because I couldn't give it a zero. Yuck! the song stinks, the singer sucks as he can't sing, and the music is just horrible. please, do not waste your money on this. If you like great music from a great singer, then I would definately Not recommend this!"
3,New in the market,"This is the first Bebo's CD which I bought. BeBo belongs to a new era and not mine. However, he has delivers the message of God's word very distintively to his listeners. If you like modern pop music, try listening to his singing."
5,Fantastic,"Bebo Norman is my new favorite Christian singer. I play his songs throughout the day. Give him a try....I'm sure you will really love him, too."
4,A Fun Romantic Frolic from Wong Jing,"This film has some very strong comedic performances from Carrie Ng, Cheung Kwok Bong, and Roy Cheung among others. Each romantic tale is quirky and funny from the Christy Cheung's superstitiousness about whom she dates to Sandra Ng's metomorphous from lover of women to devoted wife and mother-to-be despite her fight against it. I think this film is one of Wong Jing's better efforts. It has less un-PC aspects to it than many of his other works. For my part, it is the strong performances, wit, and chemistry between the cast members that make this film worth seeing for some escapist fun."
3,Perchance to ....,"This book will convince you that insomnia isn't all that bad a thing.Which is worse: a megalomaniac or someone pulling the strings who doesn't even know he's doing it? Lethem will have you scratching your head continuously as you try to figure out the meaning of this (pick a genre so long as ""strange"" is part of the description) book.It seems the consensus of reviewers is that there is a weak ending. Add my vote to that tally. This is a weird book which is fine; but coupling it with a non-existent finish does a disservice to the reader."
3,My favorite Lethem novel,"In each of his novels Jonathan Lethem uses well-worn genres as tent poles on which to drape his highly original stories; in this one it's a collision between the road movie (especially the post-apocalyptic subgenre, viz. Mad Max or A Boy And His Dog) vs. the paranoiac SF of Philip K Dick. And as always, Lethem pulls it off beautifully. I'm a great fan of Dick, so I loved the way Lethem lovingly polishes all the PKD archetypes like lost memories and reality-bending authority figures, but Amnesia Moon rises beyond mere pastiche. To me, it's the most enjoyable of all of Lethem's novels."
3,Unsolved mysteries,"More like Ridley Walker than Catcher in the Rye (the book the blurbs compare it to), this was a fast, confusing read. The plot promises but does not deliver, so I felt somewhat let down. Questions are dangled like carrots in front of the reader, but they are not answered. A bit too derivative of PK Dick, but a fun read. BTW, the book sat on my shelf for ten years, since picking it up as a hc remainder from Daedalus back in the 90's. Finally read it! But not in a hurry to read more by this author (thoughThe Fortress of Solitudelooks interesting)."
5,Dance your Dreams!,"Marykate and Ashely go of to New York city to dance with the New York City Ballet, one dancer holds a class and teachs the twins with some of there girlfriends to dance and how to jump and move your arms in ballet, then they go off to New York city park where they dance with white dresss on to Swan Lake , At the end they see a Ballet show and Marykates dream comes true."
4,good movie,i like the movie ive seen it on tv before i wanted it the movie works good and thanks again
2,Love doesn't come softly,"It appears they were going for the Love Comes Softly Series,even if they were not, this movie was a let down. The scene was nice however the acting was disappointing and the way she spoke to him when he went through her things was ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS! She spoke to him like a child, could not feel the romance. The responses to the dramatic scences could have been better."
2,Civil Love,"The script was poorly written, the acting was bad and tedious. It was a good concept but was poorly carried through."
3,really a 2.5,"I thought for .99 i would try a new mystery author. I did not realize there was so much romance involved. Situated in san francisco, i thought this was the perfect new author book. I enjoyed the mystery but, the book was way too mushy for me"
3,"Not bad, but not great either",I've read other Barbara Freethy books that I enjoyed more than this one. I just didn't connect with the characters and so didn't become engrossed in the book the way I hope to when I'm reading. It's not a terrible book by any means and I'm sure some people thoroughly enjoyed it. I'm just not one of those people.
5,great book,This book held my attention from beginning to end and I enjoyed it immensely. I would recommend this as A+.
4,a good read,I really enjoyed the mystery and the romance of the book. It's a fun and quick read with a good story line. The romance was there but not overpowering (or graphic) and the mystery was fun to follow.
2,Not recommend,"I think I was cheated by the name. This is NOT a good book, at all, IMHO. The book didn't provide any pratical means to do the fundamental analysis. Most of the contents are explanation of concepts, things like company report, definition of ratios, which you can find a lot on the internet. Another feature of this book is its fake examples, which means there is no real example to illustrate how to do things in real world.I doubt if the author ever made a penny through his ""approach"", if he had one. He must have made a lot through writing books. 50 books like this?"
3,Huge,"I bought these bulbs to use in hanging pendant lights. The CFLs I had in the pendants were too long and hung out the bottom - just looked crappy. So I ordered these 'mini' lamps. Ha! Shame on me for believing 'mini' meant smaller. Not quite sure what Globe considers ""mini"" but these things are huge. They hung out of the pendant light further than the originals. I'll keep them because I can use them for some other fixtures. I ended up buying CFLs at Target - I think they're GE - much shorter and the pendants look much better."
3,Work but aren't ideal,"I ordered these bulbs because I wanted to replace the bulbs in my overhead lights fixtures (which take little bulbs with regular-sized bases). The first thing I noticed is that despite being ""mini"" these bulbs are actually pretty large -- at least twice, if not three times, the size of chandelier bulbs. Unlike the other compact fluorescent light bulbs I own (I think I have the Sylvania brand), these ones emit a faint hum and take a second to turn on. They are also not as bright as the other ""100 Watt equivalent"" bulbs I own, which also take 23W.On the positive side, they DO work (I don't know about the comparable lifespan), and they're cheaper than the Sylvania brand (I pay $5 each at the grocery store)."
4,Nice but a bit of adjustment,"I would say they are closer to a 75 watt Equivalent;It is a much colder feeling light;It takes about 1 second to turn on and about 20-30 to reach full brightness. (hard to get used to)All that said, I will definitely continue buying them because the benefits far outweigh the downsides, and I will probably be used to the changes after a little while."
1,Two bulbs broken in shipment,Amazon made good on the breakage. The bulbs arrived smashed because the vendor removed two bulbs from a six pack to make this four pack.If I knew the problem had been resolved with the vendor and would not reoccur I would buy another 4 pack right now. The bulbs throw off nice light. Because I do not care possibly to file a complaint again and receive a charge back on my credit card I'll either wait until it becomes clear these bulbs are arriving intact for others or pick them up at a store.
3,Night driving glasses,Bought these in hopes it would help with night time driving. It did not help. I still see halos. I think it would work better if you were behind a computer screen all day.
1,WORTHLESS,ABSOLUTELY MAKES ZERO DIFFERENCE IN VISION. CONTACTED SELLER IMMEDIATELY AND GOT NO RESPONSE BACK FOR A REFUND. WHAT A WASTE OF A PRODUCT.COMPLETELY UNSATISFIED.
5,Instant club classic,"This is probably the closest Oomph!, one of the most underestimated bands ever, came to doing a 'pop song'. But it's still a song that says ""shove your finger down my throat until I can throw up"" (in German, of course), and it's absolutely wonderful, and has become an instant underground club hit - unfortunately only in Germany. Singer Dero is doing a duet for the first time, with German pop singer Nina Hagen. The single is packed with good stuff: Besides the album version of the song, it also contains one mediocre (Oliver Beltz) and two excellent (by Oomph! and Steve Naghavi of the famous German band 'And One') remixes as well as live versions of Unsere Rettung and Gekreuzigt (a scandal song)from their '98 album Unrein. If you never heard of Oomph! you should get this Maxi CD if you want a taste of what they're like; it's worth it."
5,Excellent Rare Disco From Late 70s & early 80s...,"This collection is special in several ways...first it has some really rare tracks I haven't heard or seen on any other comps...And the remastering is very good.Check it out.. John Paul Youngs ""Love Is In The Air"" & "" Shine On Silver Moon"" By Marilyn Mccoo & Billy davis jr. Wow that one really takes me back to my room in Miami 78"" or 79' maybe even 80' livin w/my folks listening to the latest Disco...ahhhhhh the memories...pik it up you won't be sorry...EG"
1,boot legged,So my mom loves this movie and i thought i'd buy it for her since it had such a great price on amazon. Come to regret it because the movie blacks out in a couple places as if someone recorded it off the TV and everytime a commercial comes on they simply blacked it out. Now this is pretty surprising considering how many people are giving this a good rating. Am i the only one who got a boot leg version???
5,"Fun, Heart-Warming Movie","A well casted, written and directed Christmas movie. Henry Winker does his usual great job and adds both fun and comedy to the Christmas theme of finding love during the holidays."
5,THE MOST WONDERFUL TIME OF THE YEAR,"My wife saw this film on HALLMARK channel and was fascinated by it, so I looked it up onAMAZON and ordered it. Delivery was quick,and I believe we have watched it at leased 15 times."
4,good,i bought this tablet about 5 years ago and it has only dropped in price about 30 dollars which is strange.i use this for adobe flash and photoshop. works with web browser applications and as a windows navigator also.very sensitive in flash and photoshop and has the same feel as a pen.it works with dual screens or one screen nicely.the MOUSE is the most useless thing though. it only works on the pad and its sensitivity is like no other mouse ive ever used. only thing i cam imagine using the mouse for is the scroll button since the pen has all the other buttons and more than a regular mouse.this definitely can pay for itself if you are in digital arts or make flash games. ive used it for my senior project in highschool and made many flash games/movies with it. it isnt frustrating to use at all and you can only get better.
4,art pad & pen,This was a great purchase I'm quite pleased. However if your computer lacks some graffic power you may need to move the pen a bit slower to avoid dot drawing a line. I don't use the mouse that came with the unit. The pen works very well and has a variety of nibs. I would buy another pad and pen.
4,Wacom Tablet,"Greatly speeds photo editing. Using the pen takes a few minutes getting used to but with a bit of practice, it becomes much more accurate than using a mouse and helps prevent the repetitive stress issues of using a mouse on large numbers of photos.This would be a five star product if not for a problem with the drivers which require them to be reinstalled every time I reboot. If I didn't like the tablet so much, I'd have returned it when this problem couldn't be resolved. There are many references to driver issues on the net, I'm not the only one with problems.But all in all, the Wacom Intuos3 is a pretty cool product."
3,harlry sheets,the sheets and pillowcases are a little rough on the skin they should have been made with a higher thread count and they would have been better but if your looking to complete the set with the certains and the bedspread then you will have to live with it
4,Powerful practical pump (one hose short),The pump is powerful and practical. It could be more stable when placed on a surface and it should have come with two hoses instead of one (outgoing and incoming). I had to buy the second hose separately.
2,Could have been better,"Got a free copy at TechWave 2004. It looked promising, but I was disappointed: I could not find much substantial material that will really help me as a DBA. This book claims to be much more than it delivers, as its actually pretty superficial. I just cannot recommend spending $45 on this book -- it doesn't add much to what's already available for free (in Sybase's own manuals)."
4,old school CIA,"A great movie that portrayed the CIA in a less Hollywood more pedestrian way. A gripping story, slow to begin with but it picks up and draws you in!"
5,"Outstanding acting, enlightening and suspenseful drama","The Company is a long production but worth the investment in time, especially Part 3. The acting is outstanding. Full of drama, suspense and history."
1,NOBODY'S ANGELS WON'T TOP THE POP WORLD,"I THINK THE NEW GIRL GROUP (AKA SPICE GIRLS) WILL NOT BE AROUND FOR AS LONG AS BRITNEY SPEARS,NSYNC AND CHRISTINA AGUILERA WILL BE AROUND. THEY ARE WAY TOO PHONY.THE MUSIC IS NOT GREAT,""IF YOU WANNA DANCE"" IS PHONY,AND THEY THINK THEY ARE SOOOOO COOL BUT GUESSS WHAT -THEY ARE NOT."
5,After 50 Listenings.....Still Rocks!,"Ahhhh....the sweet sounds of angelic harmony. This album totally grows on you, some of my fave songs are the funky ""Next Stop Heaven"", the soulfull ""Nobody"" and the downright ethereal ""Can't Help Myself."" As for all these ridiculous SpiceGirl comparisons? whatever, that makes no sense, these girls can sing, dance, and brighten your day. A highly recommendable album."
2,This album was a disappointment,"Of the 13 songs on this album, there are only 2 that I feel are worth listening too. ""I Can't Help Myeslf"" and ""Right There Waiting"" are the only decent songs on it."
4,Good.,This product was in the exact condition that the seller described it as. this was a very pleasant interaction and deal.
3,Basic MP3 player,"Bought this device for my 6yo daughter. Nice, basic design. Uses SD card for MP3 storage. Card is on a spring lock, so sometimes the card gets ejected by pushing on it, but not a huge deal.Interface is very basic. LED display (omg do they still make this type of screen?). Can only play songs by order they were placed on the SD card. (i.e. Track 001, 002, 003), no recognition of song name or tag information.Again, it is a very basic, cheap MP3 player. My daughter loves it and knows exactly which track has her HSM2 soundtrack, so that's all that matters.Worth the money (because it's dirt cheap), but personally I couldn't use it or even compare it to an iPod, iRiver or Creative type of device."
1,YUCK,"YUCK. It's the Olsen Twins. The two most exploited children in history. They can't sing, but hey, they have blue eyes and blonde hair. We can make some money off of them. Disgusting."
4,Great quality,"Picture and sound quality are excellent. Seems a little long, tried to complete watching in in two sitting and was unsuccessful."
3,okay but buy the funk on fire 2 cd set.,good songs but you really need the funk on fire cd set for more of the best funk group in ohio at the time.
1,Awful,"This is NOT designed for individual study! Buyer beware! I bought this rather expensive book thinking this would be a great resource for review before I take graduate school placement exams ... wrong!! The accompanying CD has examples played on a synthesizer, and they DO NOT follow the progression of the book as one would seem logical. The CD includes ONE set, or ""transcription"" for each unit, and does not have ANY of the examples from the book recorded onto it AT ALL. In addition, these transcriptions seems to be mainly of a synthesizer or of a guitar (and synthesizer). This is not really suited for serious college music students, at least (I am guessing) without the teacher edition. Now, after having written my name in the front cover, I suppose I will have to try to track down a teacher ed. IMHO, this was a big waste of money."
4,Very interesting book,"The author of this book did a really nice job of incorporating a variety of spiritual questions and perspectives ranging from reform to orthodox. This incorporation, in conjunction with an interesting human tale, kept me committed to the story. I also enjoyed learning more about a rabbi's experience and the joys/struggles of the job."
4,Another Great Paretsky book,"This book was very difficult to follow at times. There was a lot of information to digest. One thing I found quite weird was that I was reading of VI's boyfriend (Morrell) going off to the land of the Thaliban just as the WTC attack and our whole mess with now with the Thaliban. I got chills. On the whole, I enjoyed it quite a bit and would recommend it to all. I will continue to remain a Sara Paretsky fan."
1,This book is Terrible!,"My first and last book by this author. The writing is horrible; the dialogue is simply awful. The plot is just stupid and the character development is unbelievable. The detective commits so many crimes herself in this story that in real life she would be charged, tried and convicted in about 10 minutes (but this author would stretch it out to 100 pages). If you want real writing, look to Stuart Woods or Michael Connelly. Don't look here, however."
4,Kaki carries the torch (and its an ADAMAS!),"Kaki is a phenomenon. The very fact that she perplexes some listeners (like Hedges did) is good. NOT smmoth, NOT new age. She brings the freshness of youth to a wonderful synthesis of ""newer"" techniques that just jump out at you. I'll give her just shy of five stars because she needs some room to grow. I'm thrilled that the wonderful Adams (cousin of Ovation) is also getting some of the glory it deserves. Fantastic!"
3,I'd give her a little more time,"It seems like people are throwing around the names of Michael Hedges, Preston Reed, and even John Petrucci(?!) to descibe her playing. It's true that maybe later on she may be good enough to be nipping at Hedges' heels but not now. I find this praise to be a little far-fetched and premature. Right now she sounds more like a Will Ackerman lite, for the sake of dropping another name into the pile. Her technique is a lot more conventional and her attempts at percusion and harmonics seem to ape the ""great masters"", not equal them. This is not discouraging. Michael Manring, the bassist who played with Hedges said in an interview that he sounded like a Neil Young clone in his early years and was not very impressed. But who knew this ""clone"" would one day give us Aerial Boundaries! I'm willing to wait for her second effort to see if that breakthrough ever happens."
1,Like Metheny? Bensusan? Hedges? Kottke? Don't be absurd!!!!,"I'm not trusting these reviews anymore! It was hard to stomach this CD even once, but after giving it a few more tries, there is no doubt in my mind that this album is devoid of any musicality. I defy any of these reviewers comparing her to Pat Metheny and Pierre Bensusan to hum or sing back a single melody from Kaki's CD! ""Good"" guitar playing is making ""good"" music, otherwise, what's the point? And no, Mark in the Middle, I'm not a jilted boyfriend or annoyed by a review I never read, this album just gives acoustic guitar soloists a bad name! The latest solo albums by Pierre Bensusan, Alex De Grassi, Pat Metheny are absolutely amazing! Kaki's music, quite frankly isn't really music at all --- it's just noodling around on the fretboard mindlessly."
1,"Very un-original, quite overpriced",The information in this book seems like it was put together in the 1950's. I found it difficult to read with many typographical errors. With very few graphics I wondered what made it so expensive. It seems like I must have read a different book than some of the other reviewers!
4,Flashman is back!,"_Flashman on the March_ has the elements fans of George Macdonald Fraser expect: abundant, detailed historical endnotes, vivid descriptions of battles, exotic locations - but the 12th installment of the series just doesn't seem as ""fun"" as the earlier works.While Flashman once again is called upon to serve King and Country (which of course he does - reluctantly) this time in Abyssinia, the sense of misadventure, lechery, cowardace-turned-heroism and outright manipulation just wasn't there in the same frolicing, smug and self-promoting manner that I have come to love in the character of Harry Paget Flashman. There is much to enjoy in _Flashman on the March_ to be sure, but it isn't among the better stories in the series."
1,Poor,"No one can deny the scope and power of De Meij's visionary work for wind ensemble. This is truly one of the gems in the literature. However, this performance is singularly bad. The balance is unforgivable, the precision is nearly nonexistent, and it gets worse from there. Most other recordings are out of print, but De Meij recommends one by the Amsterdam Wind Orchestra, if you can find it. Whether or not you can find another recording, this one is a waste of your money. You'd do better to try and hum it."
5,bagel bed,I bought this bed for our black lab. she weighs around 90lbs thought this bed would be just the right size but turns out we could put two of her in it.she took to it right away as soon as i put it in the living room!
5,Donut dog in a bagel bed- heaven,"I bought this for my sister's dog who loves to sleep almost under the couch. She can put her nose in the side of this bed when she sleeps and looks very comfortable. Best part is that you can wash it in the washing machine- a good bed for an old dog that has ""accidents."" Also a good thing for a dog that loves your bed, but you don't love that your dog loves your bed. Hopefully this bed will last a long time!"
1,A real skin crawler,"I have read a number of Marion Chesney Regencies and I enjoyed them greatly. This particular work made my skin crawl. The only character that was not made of cardboard was a murderess who demonstrated the personality of a sociopath. If you want a Regency romance, please give this book a wide berth."
1,This is a poor excuse for writing,I read this about a year ago and it took me almost a year just to force myself to finish this book it was so awful. I enjoy Frank Herberts work so much I was sorely disappointed by his son. The characters where one dimensional. He seemed to use the sci-fi aspect as an excuse to throw in ridiculous junk that supposedly justified his pathetic characters lack of reason or humanity. I only Pray that he managed to not screw up the new DUNE book he co-wrote. I'd give this zero stars if it was an option
2,Adobe Photoshop Restoration & Retouching (3rd Edition) (Voices That Matter),I was diapointed that I had to pay DKR 132 duty to get the book!
5,Best Photoshop book I have ever bought!,"I have more Photoshop books than I wish to count. Many touch on a few topics that I am interested in, then move on. Katrin Eismann's book is the first that I eagerly read cover to cover. This is exactly what I was looking for in a Photoshop book. When I was finished I wanted more of her knowledge and teaching. So I am now reading her book, ""Masking & Compositing."" It is just as in-depth and everything I expected from her.This is not a book for beginners. Most of the other Photoshop books will fit this need. I will not go into detail about the book as many reviews have done a better job than I am capable. But the other reviews were the reason I picked this book and trust me, they are right on the mark. This is a wonderful, well written book that contains a wealth of information. Buy it, you will not be disappointed!"
2,Disappointing,"1) Leave a massively strong smell. If it's irritating me as a human, I can only imagine how bad it must be for super-smell cats. My cat was whining a bit an hour after using these wipes, and the only thing that could be wrong is the smell.2) Didn't really remove any dirt. Totally misses the undercoat.3) Leaves a residue. My cat didn't feel soft but felt sort of greasy.I ended up giving my cat a nice bath to get the smell and grime off him. Lots of dirt went down the drain and my cat ended up super soft, and a lighter shade of grey."
5,Mighty Mountain,"Guitar legend Leslie West once again proves that mountain were and still are a rock/blues supergroup.West can do it all on the guitar.From in your face red hot rock to smokin blues.Recorded live extended versions of classic Mountain songs.A great cd to add to your collection. This compilation cd Rocks from beginning to end.If you're familiar with Mountain you know what to expect.If you are'nt familiar with the band,strap on your seat belt and get ready for take off!The kings of the supergroup rock trio's will show you why they were the best!If you're into Mountain get the cd,if not, get it and you'll definitly became a fan."
1,Still waiting after more than a month,I ordered this T.V. over a month ago and still have not received it. Each week I receive an e-mail saying the shipment is delayed yet the order status says it is being prepared for shipment (it has said this for the past 2 1/2 weeks) and therefore I cannot cancel the order. Of course no one responds to the e-mails I send regarding the order status. I am very disappointed with Amazon and would not purchase large items from this site again.
2,Enough with the weird stuff. Get back to funny.,"Halfway through season 3, it's getting hard to tell if I'm watching Louis C.K., or if the enterprise has been taken over by Fellini (or mybe John Waters). It seems to be more about plumbing the depths of the bizarre than about getting laughs, and I've gotta say, It's not doing it for me so far. Here's hoping that Mr. C.K. remembers where the roots of his success lie (i.e. Comedy), and returns to them"
2,Disappointed,"I recommend not buying this product. Encarta is (was) a useful tool, but the 'improvements' in the 2006 version are not helpful. I was previously using the 2000 version which is not only much easier to navigate, but has apparently MORE information.Just a few of many criticisms include:The feature for famous quotations is organized only by author, not by subject (as it was in 2000).There is no audio pronounciation for many of the words in the dictionary.The atlas is not easily accessible.The authors of Encyclopaedia articles are not always listed.The archives are not as complete as in 2000.It cannot be customized.The flight-simulator feature has been removed.I was wrong to purchase the updated version."
2,OK,"This is an okay resource, the information and ideas are good but it lacks an index so it can be difficult to find what you are looking for."
3,Top of My Lungs review,"Phillips, Craig, and Dean are an excellent group.I wasn't paying attention, however, and didn't notice that thisCD was a live performance. I'm not as fond of those as thestraight recorded music."
5,Top of My Lungs,"Fans of Newsong/4Him will enjoy this album. Top of My Lungs is a great representation of this group's sound, and the harmonies on this specific album are outstanding. I recommend this album to anyone who enjoys contemporary pop with a great message."
1,"Movie is 5 stars, but dvd is 1 star","I love this movie, and have been waiting for it to be released on dvd. Unfortunately, the dvd was not worth the wait. The dvd has no features whatsoever, not even subtitles. The main menu has two options, play movie and chapter selections. The sound and picture are no better than the video; the only benefits the dvd has over the video are that you can fast forward directly to a specific scene, and you have your choice of full screen and wide screen (double sided dvd). What's the point of making a dvd if it is as bad as this one? Very disappointing....P.S. This is for the 1999 dvd version. I noticed that a new version was released in 2003. Hopefully that version is better."
2,Over Priced Stuffed Animals,"The only reason I buy these Webkins is because my little sister loves them, but I in all honestly think that they are way overpriced. You are not actually paying for the animal itself but the online subscription to interact with the animal online. However, the subscription expires in one year and its very costly every month to continue it. I don't understand why it's so expensive and some animals cost more than others and they are not even collectors items. My only issue with these Webkins is the price, but who can put a price on a childs happiness?"
2,Stopped playing dvds,"Great surround sound! That is the only reason I am keeping it. Lots of inputs and outputs on the back. It allows you to get technical and complicated with your tv set up. I have HD TV and digital TV as well as sat radio hooked to it. It stopped playing DVD's about 2 years after use. And it also has a weird noise coming from the fan when starting it up occassionaly. It goes away if you keep turning it on and off. It worked great for 2 years, but now it does not pick up DVD's. I tried cleaning and everything...Nothing. Now it is just a surround system. Mine was refurbished and bought from amazon. They did not inform me it was referb. but I guess for such a good price, it had to be. Stay away from this item. It works great for a little while, then it dies."
1,Terrible System,"This is a terrible system. I'm a Samsung guy, for the most part. I have several Samsung products and have not had very many issues as I have with this one item. This system is plagued with issues. Do a search online concerning this system and you will find it was a lemon from the start. Practically everyone has had the same problems. Just on the other side of the warranty, the system starts picking when and what DVD's it wants to play. Eventually, it stopped playing DVD's or CD's most of the time. I sent it back to Samsung for repairs, but their repairs only fixed it so it will play about 90% of the time. There are better systems out there. I would not recommend purchasing this aged and problem-ridden system."
1,HORRIBLE,This product was labeled as nearly new and it didn't even work. It played for about 20 minutes and then skipped and then stopped working completely. I had to go to Wal-Mart and get a new one. I think that if you are labeling something as nearly new then that is what the customer should be getting. I have always bought from amazon and was completely disappointed in this product.
1,Mediocrity Squared,"I am a huge Star Wars Fan. But this is the worst of star wars - way too much plot, relationships that don't make sense, incomprehensible storyline, and terrible dialogue - without any of the magic that makes star wars great. The show seems to be ""dumbed down"" about for kids, but is so violent that I would never let my kids watch it. Pick up the two-part animated ""Clone Wars"" from 2005. It trumps this new version to the Nth degree."
1,A Clone of Clone Wars Movie,Let the buyer beware THIS IS AN ANIMATED clone of the Clone Wars movie. How sickening. An animated Star Wars movie. There should be a notation in the title heading that this is animated.
4,Fun enough to watch 15 episodes in a row,I love the on-going story line - I'm a Dad with two boys (4 & 7) who enjoys watching these as much as they do.
2,Doesn't Lucas have enough of our money?,"I, like many other Star Wars faithful went and saw this movie in the theater. At first it seems ok, it not slightly interesting. Mid way thru you realize you are watching a vehicle for something else. The story is uninteresting and the climax is anti without resolve. I left the theater wondering whyt he hell I just paid to watch a short story with no revealations. It was in truth a intro to the Cartoon Network series which you can pick any episode and expand it to create this movie. Simply its just an episode and not really a movie. It just takes a long time to watch. The animation is substandard. Worth buying to add to the collection...nothing more. Series is better."
1,Missing Rancor Pit scene,"According to my son, THE WALKING, TALKING STAR WARS ENCYCLOPEDIA, our DVD is missing a scene. He has viewed others' DVDs and seen the scene in question.Missing scene:Anakin, Ahsoka, Ventress fall into the rancor pit. The scene is a few minutes long."
2,The Series is WAY Better,"I got this movie for cheap and have been watching the animated series. It's good to see where the series begins, but the movie is pretty bad. I bought it to complete the collection, but definitely recommend getting the clone wars series."
1,KEEP IT GEORGE!!!!!!!!!,"IF THIS IS THE ""NEXT GENERATION OF STAR WARS"" YOU CAN KEEP IT. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR GIVE GEORGE LUCAS ANY MORE OF YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY. IF THIS DISC WAS GIVEN TO ME FOR FREE, I WOULD HAVE MADE A CD CLOCK OUT OF IT. WHAT A WASTE."
1,Outdated info and research... good for 1995 but not 2010,"I was very excited when I picked this book up in the bookstore. It had great reviews on the cover and seemed very comprehensive.However, once I got home and looked at the publishing date (1995), I was alarmed. I realize that a lot of new studies have been done since 1995 and feared that the book may be dated. I learned my lesson that I should always check publishing date before I buy another book ""based on science"" again.After spending just 30 minutes of reading the book, my fears were confirmed. Much of the book is outdated and has old studies. (for i.e. sections on Omega 3 fatty acids, the RDA, vitamin supplements, Vitamin E recommendations, etc)This book would have been a great resource back in 1995 but useless for 2010.The book was so useless that I returned it back to the bookstore the next day."
1,Shameful,"Outdated facts, arbitrary topics, and a false populist tone fill this careless guide. Have the authors read any scientific or medical journal published after the Victorian age?"
2,Tasty but not durable at all!,"I purchased this nylabone for my 4 month old teething puppy. I figured she'd enjoy a tasty chew toy. She's quite the chewer so I was thinking the bone would last a day or two at best. However that was wishful thinking! In less than 20 minutes, she had consumed all of it but the bulky end (which we threw away). We couldn't believe how quickly she chewed it up! Definitely not worth the $8."
1,what a waste,I wish I had read the other two reviews here. I picked this up at a local store for about 6 bucks. My dog just ate half of it in 5 minutes and would be done with it now if I had not taken it away. And he is only 5 months old...so an older bigger dog could destroy this even quicker. I can't believe they actually sell these...at that price at least. He absolutely loved it and is quite mad I took it away...but not worth the money.
1,Don't waste your money,"Unless this thing is defective, it doesn't work at all. My finger touching the terminal screws picks up better than the antenna. Plus, it works better with the power pack disconnected than it does with it connected. Junk."
4,"Not quite the ""Ultimate"" Teena Marie compilation but still great.","Although this is NOT an ""Ultimate"" collection of Teena Marie's music it is one of her most comprehensive collections. A truly ultimate Teena Marie collection would be a 2-CD set covering both her Motown and Epic recordings. That aside, however, this is an excellent anthology of Teena's music and a great starting point for anyone being introduced for the first time to this great but underrated R&B diva's most popular Motown tracks."
5,"Exciting, Funky, Smooth as Silk!!","This collection is a must have for Teena Marie fans! All the hits are here and it is jammin'! It's funky with cuts like ""Square Biz"", ""Behind the Groove"", and ""It Must be Magic"". Then it's smooth as silk with tunes like ""Portuguese Love"",""Young Love"" and ""Fire and Desire"". This collection is a must have and I'm glad I added it to my collection. Teena's gone now but her Music will live on in the hearts and memories of many!"
1,Glass is flawed on bottom!,"Must be a cheap Chinese knock-off as the bottom doesn't seat will with new blade and seal, leaks all over!"
4,Krups Blender Replacement Jar,"Good replacement for original, although it seems a little large at the top as the lid is not as snug as it was on the original jar."
3,ok cd,"ok cd but it has too many skits. best on trillville are neva eva,get some crunk in yo system f/pastor troy,weakes link. some cut sucks so much it was way to overplayed. the best on lil' scrappy are head bussa and no problem"
3,The Lil Scrappy side is a little better,I have now heard enough to review this album there was Trillvilles album then Lil Scrappy album.so far there has beenabout 3 singles of this 2 by Scrappy and 1 by Trillville.The Scrappy Cd featured better production.No Problems really hereTrillvilleLyrics 6/10 Production 7/10 X Factor 7/10 Classic 6/10 Me 8/10Lil ScrappyLyrics 6/10 Production 9/10 X Factor 8/10 Classic 6/10 Me 9/10Total 6/10 8/10 7.5/10 6/10 8.5/10Overall 36/50-72% This album will get a total of 3.5 Micsthe Lil Scrappy part would get 38/50-76%and Trillville part would get 34/50-68%
2,Weak,This was not a very good book. The idea is interesting but the writing is poor. There are long sections of expositional dialogue where characters discuss (even lecture on) the uninteresting scientific principles which underly the book's plot. The characters are unlikeable. Barnes never really explores the possibilities of the German-run post WW2 world he creates.
1,Songs - but no score,"Very disappointed to find none of the original score to the film on this CD at all. Weird! The songs are fine, but it doesn't really give a feel of the movie."
3,"Well built, but a little small","I was impressed with the build quality of this carrier. However, it is listed as capable of carrying a 20lb dog. I put my 10lb Yorkie boy in it and because of the way the front is angled looked to me to be cramped for him. I had to return it for this reason."
3,Doggy stroller,"I bought this for my lazy boston terrier. She is 23 pounds. She just fits.I should have gotten the bigger size, but the price was within my budget. She fits, but she can only sit,she can't lie down. It was extremely easy to put together, we used within 5 minutes of getting it. It folds up nicely in my car, has great storage pocket, and a nifty sun visor."
1,This pet stroller seems,"to be very well built until one assembles the wheels. I do not want the hassle of returning item but the quality of the wheels are cheap, cheap, cheap. For the money spent this should have heavy duty wheels. I have no other complaints about the pet stroller but how can you go so cheap on the wheels when they are the part hitting the rough concrete. Shame on you. You probably figure most people will not return item because it is so bulky; you are right in my case but I will remember not to purchase anything that comes from Outward Hound again for fear of it not being good quality. If you are just the seller and not the manufacturer, please forward my scathing opinion to the manufacturer. Buyer beware."
1,Looks great-didn't last,The clock was exactly what we were looking for until when we went to hang it on the wall-it didn't work. Battery after battery-no dice...its just decoration-hubby didn't want to send back. oh well...
4,Noah's Ark Coin Bank,"Purchased this bank for a animal-themed baby shower I co-hosted. Guests dropped in coins which totalled their age (a penny for each year)... then guesses were made as to the amount in baby's ""college fund seed money""... winner won a door prize and parents-to-be took the bank home full of coins.I searched and searched for a coin bank that would allow coins and dollars (some guests must look exceptionally young for their age)to be inserted that also had a plug for accessing the funds without literally breaking the bank. This was a very reasonably-priced item and the quality is good. High-quality banks were outrageously priced and designed to be door stoppers or significant accessories to a child's room. This Noah's Ark bank is the perfect size for sitting on baby's dresser shelf. The bonus is a see-thru window."
3,Time Saver,The working papers saved me time by having the page set up for the answers. No need draw up a ledger or journal with titles on notebook paper.
4,Excellent collection of games,"I really enjoy the collection of games. The analysis is very good. If you like Kasparov, you will like this book."
1,Not enough of personal stuff,This is a great collection of games but not enough meat. Any grandmaster can do analysis like this with Fritz. I expected a lot more.
4,Love this one!,"My husband and I just bought this travel system for our baby due in a couple weeks. We spent quite a bit of time in the stroller dept. at Babies R Us; pushing strollers around, strapping and unstrapping car seats, carrying car seats, etc. This one came out better than most of the others, for the best price. The stroller rides extremely smooth-it's easy to manuever, the car seat isn't too heavy, and the stroller isn't overly huge, so I don't feel like I'm pushing a bus! I don't exactly LOVE the fabric design, (the reason for my 4 stars, although it's not bad) but it's good for either boy or girl, and again, this was by far the best stroller for the best price. Although we don't have our baby to put it to the test quite yet, I would highly reccommend this stroller!"
1,Not for typists,"This keyboard is not for the touch typist. You have to pound on the keys to get them to make contact. Expect many, many mistakes. Plus the spacebar is tiny. The only good thing I can say about it is that the number pad on the right works very well. I'd return the thing, but it was so cheap, it would cost me almost as much to return it in shipping than it did to purchase it. My recommendation: keep looking."
2,Sadly..,Sadly one of the discs in Part two was scratched when I got it.. ruined two good episodes.Overall its great though Im sure I just got one bad disc.
1,missing tracks,The disc I received from Amazon did NOT contain the bonus tracks as advertised. The song I was looking for is not even on the CD. I opened it hoping the label was incomplete so now I cannot return it.
5,Excellent writing by an excellent author.,"Rebecca has the writing ability to keep readers asking for more, more, more. This book, I have claimed it as my favorite, had me reading until the wee hours because I could not let it go. The Mentor, a very loving and honest and respected judge has taken time to mentor two young people he truly has deep feelings about. His wife had passed away and not ever having children of his own has taken these two people to teach, help and love. The story is compelling and the two people he mentored both become lawyers. They soaked up his intelligence, patience and love and went into the working world to use what he taught them. One took advantage and one became the spirit of his honorable self. I cannot get enough of this authors writing, she is more than an author, she puts humanity and justice into her novels. This book is a must read for every reader. Enjoy as I did."
4,Surprisingly good book incomplete ending,it did surprise me it was a good read .Too many story lines and characters. and disappointing ending I hope this means a sequel to tie things up.
2,Aerator Shoes Difficult to use,"Very difficult to wear and use on the lawn. Foot keeps getting stuck in the dirt and grass.Much better to get a person with an aeration machine. Maybe a strong, young man coulddo better then we did????"
1,"Nice idea, poor execution","I bought this on the recommendation of a famous gardener (his DVD), but was very disappointed. The problem is that the sandals kept coming off, which caused a lot of frustration. No matter how I tied it down, it would eventually come loose and fall off. It's a nice idea, but this particular version is a waste of money. Instead, I recommend the standard aerator too, the Yard Butler M-7C Lawn Spike Aerator, also available here on Amazon. That is very effective and a much better value over this particular product."
1,Disappointed,"I should have listened to the negative reviews. The plastic straps on these broke within seconds of trying to get these tight enough. I finally ended up having to duct tape these to my shoes. Once I was able to do that, they finally held tight. When I finished, I noticed that two of the spikes were bent. I guess I must have stepped on a root or something. Will not be purchasing these again!"
1,joke gift,Obviously these are in effective. But makes a great joke gift. So now they are asking me to write at least 20 words. I would not have bought these for any other reason- it was a joke. Who knows maybe they work. I'll never know.
3,Aerator Shoes,"The plastic base and spikes are very sturdy. The other reviews I read allowed me to be prepared when buckling the straps. As other reviews mentioned, the buckled strap came undone after a few steps. I located the straps thru the buckle in a manner that kept them securely tightly. I was also prepared to buy an additional buckle/strap that would secure the aerators to my shoes. The previous reviews were helpful and allowed me to make a decision even though I knew I might have to buy additional pieces for the aerators to work properly."
1,Rubbish!,"These garden shoes are rubbish. I have average size 6 feet. Shoes just flopped all over the place when walking as straps did not hold shoe against the foot. Straps broke when trying to tighten. I tried taking the nails out and pushing them through the soles of crocs but the angle was too awkward Basically, the nails need to be attached to a shoe which fits against the foot I'm going to buy myself some running spikes instead!"
1,Not Great,"I took a chance with these even after reading the mostly negative reviews. Really a pretty bad product.A buckle/strap broke on one shoe the first time a tried to tighten them. Then as others have described, I had to duct tape the shoes on to keep them from falling off. Don't waste your time."
3,Troubled straps.,"In order to use these shoes effectively they have to be on really tight, especially at the heel. Otherwise, they come loose and flop around or your feet come out of the straps. The buckles on the straps are very weak. After tightening the straps to get a solid fit, the buckles broke. Because I didn't want to go through the trouble of shipping this product back, I modified the straps to stay in place. After walking around the yard many times over a period of a couple of weeks with the shoes on, the grass seems to be responding to the loosening of the soil. The shoes even broke up some of the thatch. Overall, I believe that if this product had more durable buckles on the straps it would be a good buy."
2,Green Giant Spiked Shoes are not worth the money,"The Bond Green Giant Spiked Aerator Shoes are very difficult to use as intended. The shoe straps come loose and can cause falls. I attached one of the shoes to the flat head of a sledge hammer and used it to drive the spikes into the ground; however, I had to double the straps back on themselves to keep them from loosening. The shoes are impossible to use as instructed. If I had the opportunity to purchase these again, I would pass. They are not worth the money spent."
4,Not that bad,Its made of sturdy plastic and doesnt seem like it would break with normal use. Does get a little loose so you have to be creative in trying to get them secure. You cant expect to walk normally with them on since they are stiff but its nice to wear in the backyard while playing with the dog - good exercise for both!
1,I should've read the reviews before I purchased!,"Once I bolted the spikes into the bases and applied the straps, I was excited to get these things out into the lawn for a test run. First step and wow! - they really dug in deep...and STAYED right there in the lawn. The straps came loose from my shoes that easily and it never got better, even after 4 tries at reconfiguring them. The directions are horrible and the straps are worse. I'm now faced with rigging my own strap system. Once I do, I'm sure they'll do a great job. Have these things been TESTED with this weak-as-hell strap system??? You cannot tell me that one person has successfully cruised around their lawn with these aerators as-is."
1,Not Dependable,"The first one was defective. The company sent me another, which worked for a while. Yesterday, it completely died. Putting new batteries in the sensor did nothing (it eats batteries like crazy, even though I only use it at night to detect when my husband with Alzheimer's leaves his room). I plugged in the AC converter and nothing happened, so it's going in the trash! I'm looking for a replacement."
4,sharp but wanders a bit,"Very sharp lens excellent for portraits, macro, my first specifically digital lens for my Sony Alpha 850 (have vintage minolta lenses). Only complaint is focus wanders significantly at times unpredictably so. Can use focus limiter or manual focus as work around. Not sure why this occurs but I have read it on Sony website. Given the great price though this is an obstacle well worth dealing with."
3,Interesting,"I read this for a book club and was not disappointed, but I don't think I'll read it again. This fictional look at Paris and its Prefect is well written."
3,no code for actionscript 2.0/MX Pro 2004,"if you're looking for Actionscript 2.0/Flash remoting, maybe should wait for the next edition."
1,blue blob and stars,bought this tv in 20078 months ago started seeing a very small blue blob in bottom right of screen. THis has now grown to cover 25% of screen .ALso there are thousands of blue dots on screen. after sony wsa sued with a class action suit (i wasnt party to this) they extended the warranty until last year. I contacted them and they told me there was nothing they can do. Its a optical block defect.DONT BUY IT
2,No exitement for a Batman story,"I got this book only because of the reviews in this page and for this reason only. Oh man, I should keep searching for reviews out there. I am (after this at least) not a fan of Matt Wagner... not his way to write nor his way to draw Batman. The ilustrations are square and dry as so his way to write; I mean, if you read this you must realize how BORING this is on the first part of the book. The way Hunter Ross gimmick both GCPD and Batman is good though, I'll give him that, but he's more into the secondary characters story that from time to time you can't avoid to flip pages in order to check if Batman is in the story at all.The book have a couple of good things, but I personally regret of buying this. Of course, I'm not the owner of truth and this might like it to you. Matter of taste!."
5,pokemon silver,"because if i trouble now, i be easy to get cross or way to go in the cave and again the trainers and elite four.so i buy this book to help me to learns how to play and discover the pokemon evolve better as even thought."
2,Half a guide,"Unlike Prima's last guide to pokemon (for red, blue, and yellow) which included a complete and detalied pokedex in the back, this book does not. A few of the new pokemon are explained, but not nearly all 250. If you want this guide, you must buy it seperate, and it is really hard to find. The walkthrough part of the guide is complete and very detailed, but the lask of the very useful pokedex ruins the guide."
1,Learn about a game before writing a book,"Maybe authors should learn about a game before writing a strategy guide, that would certainly be a good idea. The people who wrote this knew nothing about the game. The section on happiness was absolutely stupid, most of the things listed there do not raise or lower happiness. They have proven they do not know anything about the mathematic values of the game, readily available through reverse engineering of a rom. The exact damage formula is not included (not that they would even know what it was), stat experience, what stat boosters REALLY do, etc."
3,Well below Faust's potential,"I cried when I read the climax of Faust's ""A Death of Honor."" That was 10 years ago, and the details of the plot have long faded from memory, but I remember that I devoured the book and marveled at my reaction to the bittersweet ending. Some time ago I picked up ""The Company Man,"" expecting more of the same, but didn't get around to reading it until a few weeks ago. Sadly, I was disappointed. It's not badly written by any stretch, but compared to ""ADoH,"" it's just typical sci-fi PI pulp. I am loathe to stop reading a book once I've started, but this one took some effort to stick with; I was fully two-thirds into the story before I really felt hooked. I hate to knock a guy's work, but overall the book just seemed typical, almost tired. If you're a die-hard JCF completist, go ahead with this; otherwise, I'd be hard-pressed to recommend it."
3,Seven years of searching?,"Jeez...I went to an out-of-print bookstore (after reading Ferman's Devils/Boddekker's Demons) and found it in five minutes. While it was probably worth that much time invested, I don't know about seven years. The Company Man is a fairly enjoyable novel, but hardly a masterwork. A bit too much of the ""aha, you may have THOUGHT X character was dead, but..."" type plot twists for me. Also, I have to admit, I never really warmed to Birch as a character--I mean, I suppose he sort of redeems himself, but...well. The ending was a bit depressing too--I mean, sure he gets the girl and escapes and everything, but the world is still a horrible corporate nightmare; nothing's even slightly different. Also...why would Astradyne just let an ex-agent who rebelled against them go on his merry way? Isn't it inevitable that he's going to be the target of numerous assassination attempts, until one of them finally succeeds? A bit implausible all around; nonetheless a halfway decent read."
1,Itched all over,"Only using it every other night, it would irritate my scalp and when washing it out in the shower, made my whole body irritated.Would not recommend."
1,DIDN'T HELP,"DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY. THIS PRODUCT DID NOTHING TO STOP HAIR LOSSOR REGROW HAIR , I USED THIS PRODUCT FOR 3 MONTHS."
4,Alright,I tried this item on someone head but I am not sure if it help or not. I think it made an improvement.
2,"Not bad, but makes hair a little greasy if you skip a day hair washing","Used this for about 6 weeks, every other day only because I noticed that it made my hair and scalp feel good, but day 2 my hair felt flatter and more greasy."
5,Try it! You may be surprised!!,"I never give reviews on products, but I couldn't sit on this one. I am an African American female who has tried so many products out there. My hair was damaged in the crown of my head for years from chemical processing. No product worked to bring back my hair until I found this product on amazon and read all the good reviews. Thank you Jesus!!! It really works!! I am so grateful for all the reviews on amazon. The reviews have really been a blessing to me and I hope my review will help someone else who may want to re-grow their hair. This product may not work for everyone, but it sure did work for me."
4,Good,"It's not bad. 1991 had so many hit songs and I am surprised they managed to squeeze 10 in here. I'm glad they included ""Hold You Tight"" and ""3 AM Eternal"". Another good one from Joel Whitburn and the Rhino gang."
3,Unhappy with looks of book,"I was a little upset by the Star Wars..the Empire Strikes back as when it was opened by my guest, the pages at the top were all wavy as in having been wet and there was no plastic covering the book."
5,A great resource for expecting and new parents!,"The Baby Guide is a wonderful book for anyone who needs baby information. And if you're a new parent or an expecting parent, you need baby information! One of the best features of the book are the 800 numbers and web site addresses of hundreds of companies and organizations. If you want to order products, catalogs, or find information, this is the only reference book you'll need. In addition, the book provides helpful advice from experts and ""real-world"" experts: parents who have the benefit of experience. Advice is provided on topics ranging from preconception preparation to postpartum depression. The Baby Guide is truly ""your total resource for pregnancy, birth and beyond!"""
1,Five uses and it quit,"I used this shredder a very few times and it quit. The red light came on, nothing I did made it operational. Very disappointed. Then I had to lug the monster to be shipped back."
3,I wish I bought a different model,"It is not quiet, as the description claims.It is not a cross cut, as the description claims, but rather little strips about an inch long. It doesn't seem quite so secure.The hole in the back of the lid is actually a paper tray, not a pass through, so if you have a home office, you'll also need to have a separate trash can by your desk.The lid is very heavy."
2,Not on Bandwagon yet,1. Amazon advertised price was lower than what I was charged.2. Amazon said it qualified for free shipping. NOT!3. Amazon stated if I ordered another product within 90 minutes orders would be combined saving shipping charges. That didn't happen either.4. Product is not as powerful as claimed. Barely shreds 5 sheets.5. Safe Sense bar is more annoying than useful.
3,Quick and quiet but lacks consisteny,"The shredder is very qick and quiet, but the cuts are not reliable in terms of length, and they also tend to clog up on the cutters. Therefore, fairly frequent cleanouts are required to maintain the equipment in spite of regular use of shredder libricant, minimal insertion of pages for shredding, and short usage periods with long rests between for cool-downs. I also remove all staples before shredding."
2,Definite No,"The machine shreds well when it works. More often a red light comes on telling you it won't shred. It is sensitive to movement, touch, any contact. The top is heavy often difficult to fit into the container. If the fit is not exact the red light is lit and it doesn't work. Most often the red light is on and I have to battle for a precise fit of the shredder onto the basket. If the basket breaks, chip, cracks the machine won't work. If you like frustration this is the machine to buy. I have had it less than a year and I am about to junk it and buy something that hopefully works well."
5,Awesome!!! An absolute have to read!!!,This is my favorite war book. I loved the games and the movie. It took me a while before I found out that there was a book series. I picked this book up and did not put it down until the third time through.YOU MUST BUY THIS!!!
2,another disappointment!,"Ugh! If you want to buy this to help your children learn French, be forwarned that there is VERY LITTLE French on this album. The female vocalist's voice isn't all that lovely and there is way too much English sung and spoken (and I can't quite understand why -- there doesn't seem to be much logic to when and why it's spoken). Sure, wheels on the bus is cute and fun, but it's mainly in English. What's the point??"
5,Great CD - my kids loved it,"The kids loved it. However, Global Village Kids has a French Nursery rhyme CD that I found that lists the lyrics seperately, now I can tell my two year old what the words mean, and they pick it up faster."
4,mix of french and english,"This is an audio CD mixing french as well as english traditional songs for children. It is 15 songs, with aditional 15 dialog where kids play translation betweem English and French which is an excellent way to encourage kids to speak French. The songs are very close to the heart, signed in both English and french, however most of French songs are by Rene, and the English are by Kids. All their voices are excellent, and you can easily follow them after few trials. I wished that The CD has the songs written, and to seperate the french from the english in seperate tracks."
5,Almost perfect!,"This CD instantly became my two-year-old's favourite. He would stand, mesmerized, listening intently. It became quite easy to get him to ask in French to listen to the disk--he was very motivated.Almost all the songs are good arrangements, though a few are spoiled a bit by corny voices and such--like people barking like dogs to the tune of Happy Birthday and one of the female singers putting on a hick accent for her part in Old MacDonald. Otherwise, the arrangements are quite musical and pleasant for a parent to hear eight gazillion times.I heartily recommend this recording!"
2,"Warning: The Song about ""Bad babies"" is generally misinterpreted by small children","The song entitled ""Bad Babies"" is not easily understood as a joke by small children. Being generally very literal, small kids will think this is a song about how bad babies are. This is in my view a real problem. I ordered this item for my preschooler but I won't play it for him now that I've listened to it.I found no such problems with either ""dog train"" or ""Philadelphia chickens"", both of which are excellent, and so much fun!"
2,disappointed with this one,"We bought this CD for our 7-year-old son (he already has ""Philadelphia Chickens"" and ""Dog Train"" by the same artist), but ""Rhinoceros Tap"" just doesn't have the charisma as the other ones by Sandra Boynton. The tunes just aren't catchy. Some of them remind me of old jazz/blues music, which I enjoy and appreciate, but the melodies are more on the somber side and it's hard to work in words that are suitable for children. As a result, my son loses interest after about the third or fourth number. The other CDs by Boynton are wonderful and we've just about worn them out, but somehow ""Rhinoceros Tap"" doesn't quite make the cut."
4,Great folksy fun,"""Folksy"" as a positive attribute. This piece is an adaptation of the Coventry Nativity Play. The music, with a contemporary sound, is a inspired complement - it has a ""folk music"" sound throughout (if opera can ever sound like folk music). Sprinkled throughout, often as interludes, are carols which are folk music in fact e.g. the Seven Joys of Mary. The orchestration is for a small ensemble - a bit more orchestral than the West Gallery tradition but still in keeping with the ""folk feeling"".The text also has British touches ... Scene 2 with the shepherds is on ""a moor at night"", one of the three kings is Merlin ...The preformance is of high quality, solid but not exceptional - but you are unlikely to find multiple recordings of this little gem available simultaneously. So enjoy this one while you may."
4,For musicians and Sondheim enthusiasts only,"As a musical theatre composer myself, this book was dead on as far as its intricate dissecting of Sondheim's scores. However, non-musicians take note: This book may not be for you. Banfield employs deep theortical analasys of Sondheim's work, and most readers without a background in music theory will find some of this book difficult to understand. As far as Banfield's analasys goes, it is right on target. He explains the various schemes and tecniques Sondheim uses in his music to make it sound exactly like what is being expressed. Banfield also does an excellent job in explaning the various actions that drove Sondheim to write his shows and the reactions that came from the critics. All in all, this is a wonderfully written book."
2,GREAT but 25% were BROKEN,"I am VERY satisfied with the bulbs I've installed - they're very bright and very compact, and they will fit anywhere an incandescent bulb would fit. They're FAR brighter than the 11 Watt ""straight"" bulbs I just got at IKEA. These give a very white light.BUT... One out of four bulbs in BOTH packages I got were broken - DOA. So, as much as I'd like to give a five star rating; I have to give two. I love Amazon, and I buy a ton of stuff here, but light bulbs are one thing you should really buy from a local vendor and transport home in your own car."
4,Useful & fun if not profitable,"It does work as advertised, but if you're looking for power increase and fuel savings, be realistic-- it will help but won't save enough fuel to pay for itself. Use it as part of a package (free flow exhaust, tweak the injector timing, etc.) and it will provide noticeable improvement. The main thing you'll notice-- either love or hate-- is the sound: You can hear the turbo whistling. Personally I like it. K&N is selling ""the sizzle"" as much as ""the bacon,"" you can personalize your ride a little bit."
4,images of narration,"A Peruvian writer explores his own past when he encounters a picture of a Machiguenga storyteller in an Italian gallery. He believes that ths storyteller in the photograph is not himself Machinguenga, but is instead a friend of his youth, Saul Zuratas.A story about telling stories, and all the different ways that there are to tell (and receive) stories. From the Kafka parrot, to the narrator's stint as a television producer, to the storyteller's stories themselves, this is a book which struggles with identity and with the real. The character of Saul is notable for his lack of place and his struggle as both a monster and an angel to exist in the world of Peru.The translation felt smooth, although it was rough enough in places that I was sorry for my inability to read Spanish. It's easy to get a bit lost in the beginning, and the stories of the storytellers seem to have lost at least a little bit in translation-- although at which level of language isn't clear to me."
4,A must read for all!,Basic survival information that everyone should read..In can most likely save your life in the event of a survival situation.
3,Okay if you are going on hiking trips ....not for preppers,"The book was ok, but only if you are going on a few day hiking trip. Has a lot of common sense stuff in it. He touches on a medical kit and some other basic supplies, but he offers nothing if you think this is a prepper guide or SHTF book. It was mostly about hiking and short term survival. Doesn't mention much about what weapons you may need to carry or even a lot of info about shelters. I dont think it was woth the 7 bucks. He is assuming that there is help somewhere out there and people will be looking for you. The illistrations were basic and laughable. I really think he should have taken more time to refine the book.So overall a good book but not for what I was looking for."
5,Read every page,"In short, this guy nails it. The book is fun but not ""fluffy"". He is irreverent. If you are offended by terms like ""doo doo head"" or statements like "" smelling like a troll's crotch"" then look elsewhere. If your sensitivities are not so heightened, you will find this book to be page after page of spot on, tight and fun information A screaming 5 stars."
4,"Great, to-the-point survival manual","Awesome purchase. This book's a keeper. It goes straight to the point and tells you what you need to know and do, if ever caught in a survival situation.One downside of the book, in my opinion, is that it does not go into a lot of detail regarding survival situations in environments other than hot deserts and cold temperate areas. The survival kit components that are featured in the book attest to that fact.But overall I love the book because it gives you knowledge you can begin to use immediately."
3,Survival,"If you haven't read any survival books before this one will help you keep alive. I can't say it is the best book, or changed my life like some of the other reviewers, but it is a solid ""OK"" book."
2,Jack of all trades,"This book tries to cover everything about Oracle 8i all in one shot. There is so much to learn about Oracle that such a book would be immense. Even though it has ""A Beginner's Guide"" in the title, there is not enough substance to teach a new user nor is there enough to satisfy an experienced user. So it befits the title ""Jack of all trades. Master of none"". It would be better to spend your money on several more focused books than on this very blurry plate of spaghetti ."
2,"Tolerated, but disapointed..","Maybe my expectations were set too high, but ""Tolerate This"" frankly wasn't all that funny. Not that the material didn't hold some humor in it, but I rarely found myself having much of a laugh at any time during the show."
1,NO DRAINAGE HOLES!!!,"the description clearly states:Vintage ceramic bonsai pots have pre-drilled drainage holesRustic finish for authentic bonsai presentationAesthetically pleasing natural variations in green colorSize: 11.25"" x 7.25"" x 1""HHand crafted in China circa 1970these have none. totally bogus. do not buy."
4,Good hair product,I haven't used it as yet I'm using the liquid in the bottle first so haven't started the tablets as yet
5,Soundtrack to the end of the world.,"Heavily influenced by Neurosis, Sweden's Cult of Luna have been at the receiving end of both critical acclaim and the occasional accusation of plagiarism, and to me they're somewhere in the middle. It's easy to see where the Neurosis comparison lies. Luna's sound revolves around roiling, slow-moving guitar waves and psychotic screaming, just like Neurosis, but they can also stow the bludgeoning and slow it down to a near-crawl, just like Neurosis. Luna don't have their forbearers versatility, but then again, who does? The Beyond is a powerful, claustrophobic album that competently demonstrates the bands mastery of both the soft and the heavy ends of the musical spectrum, though at 63 minutes it drags on a bit too long for its own good. Dig that cover, though."
3,Panis Angelicus,Good music and good singing but the title track and some others spoilt by poor balancing. With the volume set at a realistic level to enjoy the singing the organ playing the introduction and links between vocal passages is all but inaudible.
1,YUCK!,"This is probably the worst song off Nivea's album; so I've got no idea why she's releasing it as a single......I don't have much to say about it; except Nivea sings out the left speaker, and R Kelly sings out the right one; which probably gives you a good indication of how bad this song actually is.....nuff said. Buy ""Don't mess with my man"" instead."
4,Canon CanoScan LiDE 80,"An excellent scanner. Have had no trouble with the scanner or the software supplied with the unit. All of the software as well as drivers supplied on the bundled CDs have worked without problem with Windows XP. Already have a lot of time logged on the unit scanning magazine articles for storage on CD because I no longer have room for the magazines. Circuitry/software does a great job of automatically compensating for old magazines where yellowing of the paper has occurred. Somewhat unhappy that I cannot register the bundled PhotoStudio software to qualify for upgrades, whereas the other software supplied can be registered."
1,"Two negatives, not a positive",Two tone-deaf gentlemen who cannot sing and who are marginally acquainted with their instruments collaborate in an album that is to music what Ed Wood was to film. I'm sure both men were charming--nothing else could explain their popularity. Being a charming guy doth not a musician make. It's terrible.
5,Collectible,"I bought this item as a collector, not as a child, the item is in optimal condition, it makes a great acquisition to my personal collection. This types of items are not often found on a regular basis in the market. By the title of the item, and the title of the company that manufactures it, I can tell it is an import. This item is a great item, and a great collectible also. Thank you for your business."
5,Let's Rock This Clubhouse!!!,"I found JBMS on Noggin last December and *I* loved it!!!! I hoped my son (then 15 mos) would be into it too...and he was!! And still is! Jack, Mary and Mel have literally been in our house every day, ever since! Whether it's VOD or playing this CD (on our iPod, every night, to get to sleep!)...my son loves it, I love it and the artists are grand. WONDERFUL show and music!!"
5,The best introduction to the subject,"I can't imagine a better introduction to the subject than this. Millard is the best reader of contemporary American fiction I've come across, and here he gives lucid and invigorating readings of more than 30 works of fiction. The books are grouped together in sections - the family, sport, the West, Language and Power, etc - to bring out different aspects of themes common to related novels, which makes the book ideal for anyone studying the subject. But anyone with a liking for the works of a wonderfully varied range of contemporary American authors (Updike, Roth, DeLillo, Doctorow, Donald Antrim, Sherman Alexie, Gish Jen, etc., etc.) will have their enjoyment of the books enhanced and their appetite for more sharpened. Enthusiastically recommended."
1,"Overwhelmed with examples, too verbose","This was a text for the class ""Understanding Religious Traditions in Multicultural America."" Confusing, verbose with too many examples and without direction, the entire class recommended our professor to never use it again. (We were her guinea pigs.) Fortunately she agreed with us, but it meant we couldn't sell back our books to the bookstore since it wasn't in demand the next year. However sore that is, to lose money over a horrible book, I'm glad others at my college won't be tortured by it.I would only recommend this book if someone wants//needs a lot of examples about various religions (Islam, Buddhism, etc.) blooming up in the US and the hardships they had to overcome/impressive places of worship."
1,A Boring Read,"While Marcia's writing was quite literate, this was actually one of the worst books I've yet read on the subject of ocean cruising. Marcia seems to find something negative to say about nearly everyone she encounters. The entire book is filled with mundane experiences and constant complaints about the people she encounters. Her statement on page 213 says it all, ""But much as our days were fraught with incidents, I could never recall any that could be elevated, even in the re-telling, to the status of `an adventure'."""
5,Works Great,"My Garmin GSMap 60CS would not pickup signals through my wife's Chevy Venture vans windshield. This did the trick. Cable is thin and pliable, so it has no problem getting through a door seal. Cable is also long enough to use it through a rear door which keeps it from interfering with driving. I now use it is both my vehicles as it enhances reception considerably. Magnet holds the unit very securely to the vehicles."
5,It Works,"I stuck the antenna onto the back of the rear view mirror and routed the cable and plug under the trim atop the windshield to the left window frame, then down through the edge of the dashboard, over the steering column and out near the power receptacle. The suction cup mount on my GPS fits into the cup holder down low. The antenna delivers very, very good signal levels to the GPS."
4,Gilssson remote antenna worked for me.,"My Garmin Street Pilot 2820 was getting worse in trying to locate satellites. It would sometime take 5 minutes or more and sometime would not locate satellites after I turned it off for a while and then back on. I bought this remote antenna and it now finds satellites very quickly. There must have been a problem with the built in antenna on the 2820, as it used to locate satellites fine, In any case, adding this remote antenna solved my problem."
5,She Wanted It All,"Being a true crime sleuth, I used to think Ann Rule was the best true crime writer ever. This book wiped my thought on that completely away. This author had such an amazing way of telling a great story, kept the book flowing from one page to the other, had amazing details about all of the characters. It felt like I was actually there witnessing it all myself. And the courtesy photos were superb too. I like to check back and forth while reading who the main characters are while I'm on that certain chapter. And while I did say ""characters"" I do know these are true stories. Still after I read this story, I went online to find out more about everyone involved. I have recommended this book to all of my fellow true crime pals."
3,Received refurbished item,"Nice tackle box, however the one I received had numerous scuff marks on the plastic casing and one of the inserts was missing....obviously it had been returned and resold as new. It was for my son's 8th birthday too, so quite a disappointment. We ended up keeping it and he loves it, but not the experience I expect from Amazon where I do literally ""ALL"" my shopping."
1,Not night driving glasses,"I purchased these so called ""night driving"" glasses for the intention of helping minimizing night glare while driving. After trying them out, I found that they provide little to no help. Their only use appears to be for computer reading as indicated on the manufacturer box. If you're looking for night driving glasses, I urge you not to purchase these because they don't help and you'll just be wasting your money."
3,Coulda been a better book,"You'd think there would have been a market for a book like this, since Index Server comes with no documentation. Instead, this book tries to teach you how to put together a query. Who needs that? Server administrators will not find much new here to help them administer this complex software and will find themselves rushing back to the Microsoft web site to find more information there."
3,New Protein Plus Power Bars,"The new and ""improved"" Protein Plus PowerBars are much drier than they were before though they are easier to chew (as advertised). Plus one gram less of protein than before."
3,40% calcium,Calcium is good but not in large amounts. 40% calcium is too much; in fact I'd prefer 0% because I already eat natural healthy foods. If you drink a lot of milk you may need to take this into consideration before purchasing this.
4,Powerbars,Great tasting protein bar providing the an easy filler before or after workouts. As well as tasting good the bar provides 23 grams of protein and although it tastes good it doesn't contain too much sugar. What is more the bar is easily digestible and doesn't need to be consumed with litres of water. Highly recommend this bar.
3,So-so,"I've had several protein bars, & this is probably my least favorite. It's not terrible, but, to me, it is very dry & has minimal peanut butter flavor."
2,not really worth it,"it seems like a handy thing and all but if you have an internet connection open when you code (presumably, since you're doing web development), the php.net documentation is much more helpful... not sure why anybody would use this. not even sure why i really bought this. i guess it looks good with all of the other little o'reilly guides that i own but it really was a waste of 5 dollars..."
2,Disappointing,"The most serious problem with this book is that there's no index. If you want to remind yourself of what arguments a particular function needs, you have to work out which category the function falls in and hunt through the appropriate chapter.It's useful as a reference if you can't get at the online PHP manual, but I've found that I rarely use it now. Maybe it's simply that the annotated online manual is so good, the book is redundant.Having said that, some of the example code provided is extremely useful, though the code layout suffers from the small size of the pages."
2,Out of date & needing improvement,"O'Reilly must sell a ton of these. Why not get a new author willing to do a good job of updating and improving. We all owe Lerdorf a lot for starting PHP in the first place. Having said that, O'Reilly needs to get an author who can update this and make it a useful reference. PHP is now on version 5.2 and this book is on version 4. It is nearly useless. I try to use this book from time to time, but never seem to find the information I need. Ie: Each function in the reference section needs at least two sentences of explanation, not a half sentence.PHP needs a couple of good current reference books. Where are they?"
3,Enjoyable Film; Poor Ending Swordfight,"This film was very good at the beginning as the characters are introduced. The evil eunuches are shown. The training regimen is fierce and I had anticipated a solid action adventure. After the rebels are attacked the action moves to Dragon Inn. The pace is slower here, but there is a lot of tension and intrigue. I felt the ending was disappointing. The final battle which is a swordfight has some questionable direction. One of the character's arm and leg gets skinned inexplicably. There is a swordfight and all of the sudden the arm is missing. I didn't get that aspect of the film. Overall, it's a good film. But, I didn't like the last battle."
3,Could have been A LOT better!,"Now I LOVE No Limit and I LOVE Snoop, but this album was a real disappointment! It's not horrible, but I think he could have made it a lot better by doing some songs with Kurupt & Daz like C-Murder did! A few good songs on here are Woof!, Still A G Thang, and DP Gangsta. It's ok, but his last album No Limit Top Dogg was MUCH better!"
5,Bringing in the BEST Snoop Ever,"No Limit what almost everyone wants. Well in 1998 No Limit Records came out with ""Da Game Is To Be Sold Not To Be Told"" The star of the C.D. is Snoop Dogg. The purpose of the C.D. was to welcome Snoop Dogg into the No Limit Family. On this album you will hear additional voices from Master P, Silkk the Shocker, Mystikal, Fiend, C-Murder, Mia X, and more. It has twenty-one songs half of them are Snoop World, Slow Down, Woof, Gin & Juice 2, Show Me Love, Hustle & Ball, Don't Let Go, Tru Tank Dogs, 20 Dollars To My Name, Still A G Thang, Whatcha Gon Do?, and more. It is an explicit content C.D. so it is a Parental advisory C.D."
5,This CD was that bomb diggity,"It is great to see that over the years Snoop is still coming with those fat beats. The song ""Still a G thang is a testament of that. Just keep doing what you're doing and keep the crowd jumpin'"
3,DA GAME WAS TOLD,"OK CD. NO LIMIT'S FIRST SNOOP RELEASE. IT IS OK. SONGS LIKE GIN N JUICE 2, SLOW DOWN, STILL A G THANG, HUSTLE AND BALL, WOOF, AND DOGGZ GONNA GET YA ARE THE BEST ON THE CD. BUY IT."
2,go back to deathrow,snoop needs to go back to deathrow or 2 dr dre there is only one or two good songs on the cd the best one being number 13 snoop leave no limit and go to a real record company like deathrow or aftermath with dre
1,This trash is wack,"this is the worst snoop dogg cd ever, no limit is hella wack and all they songs sound the same. there is only 2 good songs on it: 20 dollars to my name and tru tank dogs. Him and mystikal should go and join dre where they are people with actually musical talent"
3,I would not suggest buying this c.d.,I would not suggest buying this c.d. snoops matierial has dropped from it's death row hits to some pretty messed up stuff.
2,The weakest Snoop- Dogg effort yet- This ain't ****!!!!,"When he was with Dre, Snoop was da man in his genre (and I usually prefer blues and rock). This new team robs Snoop of his wonderful originality; it just does't work. Buy another Doggystyle."
1,The most poor album i have ever heard,"Please Do not waste your money on this. In fact its so poor they should have negative ratings for it. F**k NO LIMIT. While im here, why does everyone think Mystikal is so good? He of all the No Limit Soldiers has to be the worst, he doesnt rap, he barks, and sounds absolutely whack."
2,Needs a crutch,"Here's the bottom line, Snoop can still bust on the mic, but No Limit's Beats By the Pound can't find the beats to match up with his g-style, playalistic flow. Please Snoop, call Dre, beg him to hook you up with some sounds, and sell 1 million again."
1,Very Flat,Snoop had the voice in the early to mid 90's.He was Rap's Version of Michael Jackson and Dr.Dre was The Quincy Jones.but after Dre Left Death Row Snoop was Forced To Play 2nd FIddle to 2pac and Never Recovered.The Dogg Father was Wack but not as Bad as This Mess.No-Limit &Their Beat-less Crew make a Mockery of Snoop here.Gin&Juice11&Woof are some of the Worst Tracks Snoops ever Recorded.well this Album is The Worst on a Whole.His Last Album was a step back in the Right Direction but he is one of those Artists that You Wonder What if?Instead of Getting Watered Down.for a while He was The Voice but you have to wonder how many more Albums Like This Before folks are thru with him?
1,WEAK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!WEAK LIKE 7 DAYS,I think that this album is the weakest thing ever I have heard better disco albums then this if snoop could just put a bullet in his head he would be doing us all a favor. This #$$% is weak like 7 days SOMEBODY NEEDS TO TELL MASTER P AND HIS WHOLE NO LYRICS FAMILY THEY TO GO F*** THEMSELVES
1,Get back to Dre Snoop!!! PLEASE!!!!!!!!!,"This has got to be the weakest production I have heard Snoop do in my life. I was so disappointed in the entire cd that I gave it away. All you NO LIMIT fans out there can keep this one to yourselves. By the way, why does Master P sound like Scarface on one track and Tupac on another. Please Snoop, get hooked up with Dre quick and bring back that ol' DPG style again!!!"
3,Some Snoop fans will be disappointed,"After some gliches in the rapper's life, he joins the infamous gangster rap label. Some may remember SNOOP from his first appearences on MYSTIKAL's ""UNPREDICTABLE"" and the ""I GOT THE HOOK-UP"" movie soundtrack. Some Snoop fans will be disappointed with the release but No Limit fans will have something else to chew on. Littered with appearences by his old buddies MYSTIKAL and MASTER P as well as other No Limit rappers. Includes ""STILL A G THANG"", ""WOOF!"" featuring FIEND and MYSTIKAL, ""WHATCHA GON DO?"" and an update of a JON B song, ""D.O.G'S GET LONELY 2""."
3,Better off with Death Row,"After hearing that Snoop Doggy Dogg was now calling himself Snoop Dogg on his CD Da Game Is To Be Sold, Not To Be Told and was with No Limit Records, I knew that he wouldn't fit to be a No Limit Soldier. After listening to this album, I was right. Probably the only good songs to listen to are Still a G Thang and Snoop World, which are the closest to DJ Pooh's music for Tha Doggfather. I still got to give Snoop Dogg his credit. Besides, it was smart for him to leave Death Row, but it wasn't smart to join No Limit."
3,Dogg's it now.,"After 2Pac and Biggy, Dogg be the top nigga and head thug. The tunes he spins are not as good as them, but since they're dead, its the best we gangstas got."
4,Good book,"I disagree with previous orator. The book is well-written and throws interesting information. It contains information on the major bomber aces, groups and squadrons of the Luftwaffe Bomber Force. Although there are other reference books this one is a good looking. But further reading is obligatory."
4,Very Interesting,"I was introduced to Ms Rae's music by the movie ""Venus"". I thought my daughter would like it and bought it for her. Unfortunately, my daughter already had this CD. Or maybe fortunately, because I'm getting to like it myself. She has an interesting voice and the arrangements are likewise interesting."
5,OH this cd is just so calming,I was nervous about getting this cd until I heard someone playing it so I took a chance. The very first song stayed in my head for weeks. This cd is a must buy if you like Sade and or a Jill Scott fan.
5,Corinne Bailey Rae,"Absolutely loved this CD, would like to purchase more from her , she is a wonderful singer!! Loved it!!"
3,There seems to be a slip up somewhere.,"How in the world can these reviews be posted even before the album came out, Has anyone notice that?"
2,"Better than Norah Jones, but not as good as Beyonce","I'll say this much: this gal is more interesting than Norah Jones, whose last 2 CDs are among the WORST albums of all time. But Corinne is not as good as Beyonce. For one, Beyonce can dance, sing, and perform much much much much much much much much much much much much better than Corinne, who has no charisma, energy, or spunk. But I'd rather take this over anything by that overrated jezebel Norah."
3,Not Bad,"Not really my cup of tea, but its alot better than alot of the other stuff thats out there now days. On thing is for sure she truly sings from her heart and soul."
4,UK Soul,"This is good CD, voice melllow and soothing, but soulful. I love ""Seasons Change""....To the person who asked the question about early CD reviews, CBR's album was released in the UK in March 2006. I purchased my copy from Amazon UK, even though I live in the US.Also, check out Terri Walker. She is the princess of UK R&B;."
5,GREAT MUSIC,LOVE THIS CD. GREAT MUSIC. GREAT SINGER. HOPE SHE MAKES MORE CDS WITHEASY LISTENING. GREAT SELLER TOO. BEST BUY ON INTERNET WHEN I BOUGHT IT.
5,Pleasing to the ear!,"Nice soulful grooves that allow the mind to rest, relax and enjoy the ride. My favorite is ""Breathless"". Treat yourself to Miss Rae soon."
2,Stop with the Billie Holiday comparisons!,"I ain't saying Billie Holiday was untouchable, but this gal can't seem to sing a whole song without going falsetto. She sounds more like a Ricki Lee Jones impersonator, with less range. Can you say ""flash in the pan""?"
4,Better than Norah Jones,"Corinne is way better than Snorah--er, I mean Norah--Jones. Great debut from a great vocalist. Check her out!"
4,Hev & The Boyz manage to keep the party going with Peaceful Journey.........,"This album could have been a solemn affair due to the death of Trouble T-Roy in 1990. But Hev & The Boyz manage to keep the party going with above average jams. I will say that this album gets my vote for the dopest, cleanest POP rap album in history.Top Joints:Now That We Found Love (Classic song & video)Sister Sister (Great uplifting song for black women)Dont Curse (Classic Posse Cut)Peaceful Journey (Classic - Sample of The Jacksons - Heartbreak Hotel)The Lovers Got What You NeedIs It Good To You (Classic)Letter To The FutureSomebody For Me (Remix) (Just as good as the original)"
5,"For Fast Flow Nipples, They Work Fine","I had needed fast flow nipples for my twins. These have fit the purpose well. These nipples are also standard size (see below), silicone texture, and traditional round shaped.* Flow: nipples come in newborn, slow, medium and fast.* Standard vs. non-standard: It's important to get nipples that fit your bottles. For example, Gerber and Medela have standard bottles. Advent has some standard and some non-standard bottles. Dr. Brown has non-standard bottles that only use Dr. Brown nipples.* Texture: soft latex, firmer silicone, and traditional rubber.* Shapes: traditional (round), orthodontic, and flat-topped."
1,Chinese Junk,"This unit was purchased in 2009 and has received about 18 months of daily use until the magnetron blew out (H98 code) and not worth the repair costs. It wasn't very long ago when a microwave would last 15-20 years. Not today, though. To get 15 years of microwave use, one would have to buy 7 or 8 units which ends up being about 2X the investment of days gone by. All that extra money is going to China and we're too stupid to do anything about it."
1,Absolutely hate it. Horrendous user interface.,"We keep wanting to take it back to Costco. I don't know what's stopping us. We bought it for the stainless steel looks. It's impossible to use the timer and the microwave at the same time. It also seems that our old cheapo white microwave generated less interference with our Wi-Fi and cordless phones, and it also returned the turntable to the same position it started from, nice touch. I never use any of the extra functions, instead I need an easy way to start microwaving, which I could do with the big ""30 sec"" button on the old one, but no dice here. Ungood."
1,Door latch not working right after 1 yr. 9 mo.,"Model # SN789, Genius Prestige. After 1 yr. and 9 mo., I am having to slam the door to make it catch, or once closed, hit the door to make it latch right before it will start. Not fun. I want my old microwave back that lasted 15 yrs."
3,good but not great,"Its not that Viva la Dregs is a bad Cd its just not a great Cd. A handful of the songs are really good , some are ok and some are just blah. Buckshot is an excellent opening track, its well structured with some nifty rhyming. Little King is a very catchy song , the chorus has an alternating falsetto and normal pitch ( almost reminds me of Our Lady Peace but no one can touch the amazing voice of Raine Maida ) Underground has a driving rhythym and again a falsetto chorus. The next 4 songs are in the ok category. Lakefly has a cool chorus with a neat hook. The rest of Viva la dregs is blah though the accurately titled Dismal Swamp is pretty cool. All in all Viva la Dregs is a good CD, with lots of creative lyrical twists and imaginative use of rhymes, but there is just not enough consistently good songs to make this a great CD."
1,The Night the Lights went out in CA...,"was about 2 weeks after we received this Flashy Family. Two of the ducks completely stopped working, even though we were very careful to dry them and put them upside down after the bath. And because the toys are sealed for water safety, you can't replace a battery or check a connection. So your toddler will be completely confounded as to why the ""ducky no light"" anymore. A waste of [...]."
4,not my husband,Purchased as a fathers' day gift for my husband. He was not impressed with the chair if I paid more than $20. I think it is very sturdy for the areas where we camp. I do think that it was reasonably priced.
4,Alps Lawn Chair,"It seems to be a quality folding chair that is constructed of strong materials that will last a long time. I have not used it much, so I am unable to give positive or negative feedback at this time."
4,well built chair,"This chair is very well built, took it camping shortly after receiving it and it was very sturdy even on uneven ground. The only thing that I did not like about the chair is that it sits a little too low to the ground for people with long legs."
5,BETTER QUINTET HERE,5 STARS because this is another good rare item.This quintet is better because it has a bass which is not common.The bass allows the cello to play more in the melody with 2 violin 1 viola.Now i like the game here very much.The string quartet here is fine to here.
2,Good but dated,"I'm sure this book was excellent in it's time but now it seems dated. There are much more beneficial titles out there for information on discus. I would recommend Perfectionist, or Discus Breeding for Beginners for more current information. If your looking for another book to round out your discus library go ahead and buy this book, but if your looking for up to date and helpful discus information go elsewhere."
3,"Truly soundtrack, not workout CD","Just FYI if you think you are going to workout to this CD, you may not like it. It really is a soundtrack of random music. Must be songs played during some shows? I do like the song that is used for the theme music."
4,In a class by itself,"If you're taking a class in Attic Greek, the one to take is the one using Athenaze as a text. It's excellent, especially if you have a teacher. The problems arrise if you use it on your own -- it's not really accurate in pronunciation, and it doesn't explain all the uses of grammar when it introduces them. On the other hand, it's not as if anyone out there speaks Attic Greek as a native language, right?"
5,"Wow!! Fresh new voice and fierce, tight writng style totally.....","rocks the genre. I really thought I had read all the variations on the vampire theme but the writing is sooo good in this second novel in the series that I got interested all over again. This is a stand alone book and not really neccessary to read the first. Trying to analyze WHY this author is really cookin' has to do with a combination of several key parts of this style of book. First this is a romantic paranormal--not a sex romp verging on ""ick"". The love scenes are sensual and even though one takes place in a smelly sewer(!!) the emotional connection between the characters feels genuine. The action clips along without the ""paint-by-numbers"" feeling so common in other books.You really get a sense of speed and jeopardy. Altogether another welcome new brand name author to add to my list."
2,Great picture -- big problems,"We bought our Sony KDF-60 two months ago, and the picture was great. Unfortunately today, after watching some football, turning the set off, and then turning it on again, the picture will not turn on. This is true even after waiting for over 30 minutes. The lamp fan whirs continuously and the screen does not darken completely. Having had the set for only two months, and having not used it extensively, we are disappointed to have such a serious problem so soon. From reading other posts on the web, it appears as though Sony has had persistent lamp problems, so maybe this is more evidence of that."
5,Best Danielle Steel book ever !,"The characters in this book are easy to identify with and quickly pull you into the story with them. I loved the parallel storylines of the past and present romances. I won't spoil the book for others by revealing any more about it. If you like books by Danielle Steel and books with a historical setting, you will love this book !"
2,Not a book you'd want for your permanent library,"This is the first Danielle Steele book I've ever read and I'm not sure I will read anything else by her. I couldn't give the book anything higher than 2 stars because of the disgraceful number of grammatical errors and the fact that the first 100 pages was actually painful to get through. And I can't give the book anything less than 2 stars because the subplot of the book (Sarah & Francois) was really captivating. My verdict? The Ghost is an interesting read, but I am at a loss to understand how it could have been so poorly edited."
3,Kindle Version,Please be prepared for many typos in the kindle version of this book. It appears that it was scanned and not proof read prior to publishing. If you can get past using the word DIEM for THEM and THE for DIE etc... the story is good.
3,The story of Francois and Sarah was remarkable.,"I, like many others, wish the whole book had been about them. What a fascinating plot! The story of Charlie was OK at best, but overall the book was made by Francois and Sarah. It is entertaining reading, with jolts into the past. I enjoy Danielle's books when she includes history. I read some reviews making cracks at mistakes made, and I understand EVERYONE's entitled to their opinion. But remember people, this is fictional romance. If you want clear, precise, exact details - history books are available."
5,It's a must read for Danielle Steele Fans,"From the time I opened the cover i was in love with this story, it kept me spell bound, i just couldn't put it down. It is definitly a very emotional moving book. I just got caught up in the story myself. If you love Danielle Steel as much as i do you have to get it."
3,FAIR,"I AM NOT A BIG DANIELLE STEEL FAN, ALTHOUGH NOW AND THEN SHE WRITES A BOOK THAT'S GOOD FOR MINDLESS, SUMMER BEACH READING. GHOST WAS BETTER THAN SOME OF MORE RECENT COOKIE CUTTER BOOKS. I LIKED THE STORY WITHIN THE STORY THAT DEALT WITH SARAH FERGUSEN BETTER THAN CHARLIE'S STORY. EVEN SO, I REALLY DO NOT SEE A LOT OF DEPTH IN ANY OF THE CHARACTORS IN MOST OF MS. STEEL'S BOOKS, THIS ONE INCLUDED. BUT WHAT DO I KNOW? HER BOOKS ARE ALWAYS ON THE BEST SELLER LIST."
3,Sort Of...,"This was an okay story... It didn't leave me wanting to read the next Steel book...it just was okay...nothing outstanding or remarkable or fantastic...it was okay...I would recommend another book, like her Secrets or The Long Road Home. Those are good stories."
1,not worth it,I bought this toy for my son form Santa. I destroyed the packing slip when it arrived. Needless to say it did not even work. I tried 3 different sets of batteries and nothing. The toy was very cheaply made. We never got to use it and I'm out the money for not saving the receipt.
1,Would be great if it worked,"Great idea, but poor quality. Minutes after starting to use it, something came loose and regardless of how many times attempted to fix, would not work again. Some buttons worked and others did not."
2,Poor quality,"I bought this toy to help my daughter learn the multiplication tables. It is very easy to use- when it works. After only a couple of days, it wouldn't even turn on. Weeks later, it mysteriously began to work again. Now it has returned to its previous malfunctioning state. I am very disappointed because my father purchased it for me in the States and brought it to Israel, where I live. I cannot easily obtain such toys."
5,great movie,Avengers is a great action movie that is non stop. Worth spending two hours watching. You won't be disappointed. Generally true to originial comic book in most aspects.
5,Amazing,"Ok everyone knows the movie itself is great so I will just stick to the product itself. So after not being able to find the 3d version of the movie, the day it was released, I decided to use Amazon. I was surprised at the $19.99 price that was offered, when I was shopping for the 3d version I noticed that the Blue-ray/DVD combo was $29.99 at the Naval Exchange which is the cheapest place to usually buy movies and its tax free. After seeing the amazon price I looked only for other prices and kept seeing the $39.99 price, so this was a no brainer $19.99 for four versions of the movie 3D Blue-ray/Blue-ray/DVD/Digital Download. Amazon has great deals and I got free shipping with my Prime accout, thank you Amazon."
5,Great movie,Casting was awesome. I would like to see less yabba yabba and more smashing. It's a bit too focused on Stark and I'll argue with any of you crack-head comic snobs on why Thor is the man. Great movie though.
5,Marvel Movies!,"I REALLY LOVED THIS MOVIE AT THE MOVIES AND NOW AT HOME,I LIKE HOW THEY HAD SOME OF THE TOP MARVEL SUPER HEROES IN ONE FILM BUT MY FAVORITE WAS THE HULK CAUSE WHEN HE GRAB THOR'S BROTHER LOKI & JUST PUT SOMETHING ON THAT BOY MANN""HULK SMASH"""
5,entertaining,It was better than I expected... Its action scenes keep on catching your attention... It's one of those movies that could easily be watched again and again!!
3,"Slow start, but ended well","The movie was a good movie, but I thought it started pretty slow. The first 30 minutes could have been better. All in all it was a good movie."
3,The Avengers,"This was a movie where the characters got in the way of the script. It was good but not great, I wouldnt pay theatre prices to go see it but I would reccomend it to a comic book fan."
3,Extra content mostly on Blu-ray discs,"Very disappointed that the product description was a bit misleading in that most of the interesting extra content is only available on the Blu-ray disc and NOT on the DVD disc. Deleted scenes, Gag Reel, Short film - NONE of these are on the DVD. ONLY on the Blu-ray version."
2,bad film,"The avengers was a weak movie that had pot holes everywhere. it was too long and needed another rewrite. I enjoyed John Carter, Men In Black 3 and American Reunion far more. Out of the super hero movies connected to this film, Iron Man was really good but had a crappy sequel and The Incredible Hulk was well done, Captain America was Okay and Thor was just there. The only one I saw at the box office before Avengers was the incredible hulk. other then Iron Man I was glad I waited for home viewing. Only reason I saw The Avengers at the box office was to see all the super heroes on the big screen in 3D, but the film was one film in a long time that I wish I stayed home."
1,Outrageous,The outrage about the pricing of this movie is that Marvel has deliberately left off the ultraviolet copy to force customers to purchase a $30 3D copy.
5,Scarlet Johansson..Need I say more?,"The movie is absolutely awesome definitely one of the better Marvel films I've seen. Oh and did I mention Scarlet? Great flic, must see!!"
5,"""And you pissed of another person. His name was Phil.""","I'm gonna keep this short as everyone has said pretty much everything there is to say about this film. It is hands down one of THE BEST movies ever made, EVER!!! The only concern I had about the movie going into it was the casting of Mark Ruffalo as ""The Hulk"", but then he turned out to be the best part of a film that was made up of nothing best THE BEST PARTS OF ANY AND ALL FILMS!!!For anyone who is iffy on watching comic book films, give this movie a go, you are guaranteed to love it!!!"
4,funny and action packed,"RDjr at his best! Plenty of eye candy and special effects, lots of action, pretty good story development (c'mon, it's a comic book movie!) and a load of hints for a sequel."
2,Marvel's The Avengers 4 Disc Combo,"Hi. I like the videos a lot but I hate for having to purchase more than what I needed(your combo proposition). I just needed a 3D blu ray and cost is not an issue. Its a waste, a terrible waste. We all should do more in keeping our earth green. This applies to the two other conbo purchase as well. Regards."
2,it is not a standard dvd,"I bought this movie because I enjoyed it at the theater and I wanted to see it again. The movie is great fun. However, I was truly disappointed when the dvd arrived without the gag reel. The description says that it comes with Marvel's first ever gag reel. The writers of the description failed to specify that the gag reel only comes with the blu ray, not the standard dvd. I'm going to return the dvd to buy the blu ray so that I'll have the gag reel."
2,Flashy without substance,"Impressive effects, but the storyline was predictable. Not one to put in the awesome category. I wouldn't watch it again."
4,Worth The Wait,"if a movie gets too hyped I pass on it, I was suprised with The Avengers a pop corn movie with special effects, a plot and great writing not to mention a top notch cast. I have only seen Thor and Captain America but will check out Iron man next.The movie was fun to watch eye candy galore!"
4,Great Movie!,I would had liked more background on all the heroes! Specially the guy with the arrows! But overall a good movie!
3,Too much awesome not enough movie,Fan of the franchise this movie tries to push too much content into too small slot. I really wish that could have been more plot development.
5,Great movie,Hope they make a sequel. One of my favorite movies. Came quickly and has been watched a ton already by family.
5,sweet...,"very fun - lots of little things for old comic book fans, get pacing keeps the kids interested. loved the little jokes here and there - good story... nicely done."
1,Marvel sucks...so does this movie.,"As a dedicated fan of Batman,and of DC Comics since my childhood,I wasn't even about to watch this overrated movie.But I was bored,so I thought what the hell.Maybe this movie could make me change my views about Marvel.Well...it didin't.My hatered for Marvel only got worse.I can't believe anybody would find this childish crap entertaining.One thing that I've always loved about Batman...especially Nolan's Batman,is how dark it was.Bottom line is,Marvel characters have always sucked and always will suck.Just look at how lame the Marvel villians are.Look at Batman's gallery of baddies.WAY better.If you love Marvel comics,you'll probally druel over this lame crap.But if you love DC,you'll hate it as much as I do."
1,Really dissapointing.....,"Most of the time I like Marvel movies alright, they're kinda doofy, but decent... that is until THIS (and Iron Man 2, haha). Ugghhhh. It really sucked. Everything looked really fake, like it looked like some normal people were dropped into a video game (maybe this is because I watched a DVD not BluRay...?) but still, that was super distracting. That was'nt even a big deal though compared to how stupid everything else about the movie was. The acting sucked, the storyline was absent, not a whole lot happened. It was just a series of attempted jokes and then some crap getting blown up. Way too long also, I was almost falling asleep towards the end. I just kinda sat there staring at the tv for a minute when it was over, pissed at myself for actually watching the whole thing. Not sure how people like this.... my parents thought it was bad too.I love the Xmen movies and usually like this type of show, but it was just too boring."
2,Despite all the noise...,"...it was still hard to stay awake watching this one. Acting was predictably wooden, and though I'm sure it provided hefty paychecks for the many ""name"" acors, the result was ponderous and frankly boring. Read the comic book instead."
1,3D DID NOT WORK,i HAVEN'T HAD A CHANCE TO SEE IT BECAUSE IT WON'T PLAY ON MY 3D BLUE RAY. THIS IS THE FIRST BAD PRODUCT I HAVE ORDERED FROM AMAZON. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS LOSER.
5,Loved the Action!,Great movie with lots of action and a good story line. I would recommend this movie and would watch again.
4,Like playing with my guys in the sink!,"The lascivious nature of my review title is but an illusion. I simply mean that this movie took me back to the days when I would fill up our double-kitchen sinks and play with my action figures in the water while kneeling on a 2-step footstool.I pitted my ""guys"" against eachother in the roiling seas; heads glued on - toothpicks replacing missing lightsabers and, ultimately, there could be only one. *Spoiler* (It was Optimus Prime)Iron Man vs. Thor - Thor vs. Hulk - Hulk vs. Loki... what more could you ask for?Except maybe a semi-trailer truck that turns into a humongous robot and a prolonged hot yoga scene with Black Widow... just to establish character.Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go play with my guys."
2,Boring,"Boring movie, terrible plot, slow and plodding, and silly special effects, such as the flying aircraft carrier. If you're really into the Avengers universe or Marvel comics you may enjoy, otherwise skip it."
4,Super Hero Orgy!,"This was a pretty good movie. Full of all sorts of girl geek ""porn"". Handsom men, in super hero costumes, saving the world? Yes please!"
5,Avengers,Avengers is the best movie I have seen with super heros. I hope they keep this franchise going because You can just look at how the first one did. I purchased this film and it is the best in my library!! Over all I give it 5 stars!!
3,It's an alright movie,"I expected a lot more action. Villains were very disappointing. The movie was decent, but it DID NOT live up to they hype. Again, the movie was alright, but I expected much more. Very big let down."
5,the avengers,This was a great deal and an awesome movie.I even received it a day earlier than I thought I would.
5,awesome avengers!,The Avengers movie was so entertaining. It was a mix of funny and drama. I loved the characters they were so all about their parts. They did a fantastic job. I cant even pick a favorite.I loved the plot and the fight scenes.I watched it several times and was entertained each time. Never a dull moment!
4,Starts slow but gets better,"Seeing all the superheroes come together was excellent, however, the pace could have been quicker. I expected to see some non- stop action after knowing they would all bring different talents to the table. Iron Man added humor to the movie and Thor (who was very easy on the eyes:)was excellent as he showed brotherly love toward his villain brother. The Hulk was better here than he was in The Hulk movie but his ""hulk"" scenes were not plentiful(although Iron Man just to provoke him to turn with his antics). The story plot could have been better but they made you forget that as they all battled in the end. There were some terrific action scenes in the end which makes you wonder why didn't they throw some of this in the beginning. Would have been nice to see Thor stretch his muscles early on."
3,bonus features NOT on DVD!!!!!,very misleading. bonus features on Blueray disc only....not on DVD. description of two disc set says both discs are the same. they are NOT. DVD version DOES NOT have deleted scenes or gag reel. major bummer.
3,NOT the best superhero movie but still an excellent one.,"The movie had great effects in it of course, we can say that now just about any modern movie but the story (and here we go again about modern movie story lines) could have used a lot of development. They need to slow down the pace a get into each character considerably more in order to make these unbelievable characters become a bit more real. Character development! Character development! Detail in story line would also serve to fill in the gaps."
2,Boring,"Full of exciting action, but I didn't care about it at all. I couldn't wait until it was over. Glad I didn't waste $25 going to see it in a movie theater. Save yourself $2 and wait till it's on TV."
3,A Super-Hero Summit Meeting,"Marvel fans will rejoice in this familiar yet entertaining comic-book spectacle. Director Josh Whedon never allows the CGI to overwhelm a deft mixture of humor, action and occasional reflection. Sincere performances further prevent the movie from lapsing into a live-action cartoon. Slightly overlong, ""Marvel's The Avengers"" provides agreeable escapism."
2,bored,"I know most of the world loved this movie. I found it slow, poorly written and boring.Maybe it was meant just for the younger crowd."
3,Yawn mostly,"I didn't see this movie at the theater so I waswaiting for it to arrive on PPV.Some have said this movie's role was to laythe ground work for future Avenger's films - maybe.Most of the movie was boring ""who is the super guy/gal?"",""why are they loners who don't play well with others?"", etc.Yawn.And while the last 20 minutes had great special effects,too much time was spent giving the individual Avengersscreen time. Other than Hulk, there was nothing in thefilm that made me want see any of them again (especiallythe next-to-worthless Agent Natasha Romanoff and the arrow-for-every-occasion,Hawkeye)."
4,Entertaining,Very entertaining. We liked how the different back ground stories converged into one. Great CG; enjoyed the humor. We're glad to have finally decided to watch it.
4,Action Fantasy,The movie was great. My only problem with it is that it requires a video player that I had to borrow.
3,Didn't live up to hype,I don't get why this movie got such high reviews. The plot was all over the place. The acting was just terrible. The script was beyond cheesy. I found myself bored in many places. It honestly felt like each scene was planned 5 minutes before it was shot. This goes to show you can put a bunch of hero characters together in one movie and forget about anything else and it will still make a ton of money. Why do we reward movie makers for such crap?
5,Genial,"Donde vayas puedes verla, en tu pc, DVD y blu ray una gran aventura en defensa de la tierra. Y a los niños les encanta!!!!"
5,Marvel's Avengers DVD,"What a great video, now I understand why the movie was such a blockbuster hit. Only watched the 3D version as I anticipated it would look spectacular and it did."
3,Video quality needs ot improve,Movie was okay. The picture quality was not good as it paused a number of times. It paused alot at the end of the movie. I missed parts of the movie.
4,2 and 1/2 hours is a bit too long,"I rarely say this, but this movie would have been better if they cut some of the action scenes. It just went on and on and on... still it was better than 90% of the other movies that came out in the last year, so it gets 4 stars."
5,Great movie!,My entire family loves this movie. I am a huge superhero fan. So you could imagine my excitement when the Avengers came out. I couldn't buy this movie fast enough.
4,Cracked Case,"The case was cracked when I received it, so it won't snap shut. I got very good deal on this though, so I wasn't too upset. Love the movie and all the extras!!!"
1,Marvel-ously dissappointing,"The film is AMAZING and well worth the wait but the extras on this are a HUGE appointment, the lack of extras is unforgiveable"
1,Stupid liberal swill,"MSNBC, are you joking? If this is where The Avengers get their news info we are truly doomed. Who are the bad guys?? Almost as bad as Batman "" The Dark Knight Rises""."
5,Great Movie!,This is a really good movie. I enjoyed both Ironman and Thor so it was great getting to watch them in a movie together. Could definitely watch more than once.
4,Entertainment and a Good laugh,If you enjoyed comic-books as a kid then you'll enjoy this film. Although some parts are a little cheesy it still is an entertaining film. Graphics are good and the storyline is as well. It sticks to the heart of our comic-book superheroes as they join together and collaborate saving the earth from evil. Ironman steals the show as usual with the laughs but that's just the performance Robert Downey Jr. playing the character gives you. As long as you can get this set for under $20 then it's worth the price. Otherwise just pick the type of Dvd quality that you enjoy and go with it. It makes a nice addition to your Dvd collection.
5,"A ""Must Own"" Movie!","There aren't many movies that are a ""Must Own"" but this movie has everything for the fan of this genre. The humor, wit, pacing, drama, believability, acting, casting, writing, cinematography, sound and effects are phenomenal! The storyline of all the recent Marvel movies culminates in this Avengers story. There are a couple of times that make you think the bad guys are going to win. Like inStar Wars: The Complete Saga (Episodes I-VI) [Blu-ray], the bad guys are very often matched in ability with the good. Can't wait to watch it in 3D again at home!"
4,Worth the rental,"I rented the Avengers to watch for a flight recently. It was worth it, the movie is good and the lead into the story is a good set up for the action and climax. I'm still not sure which Avenger I like the best but the Hulk is pretty awesome in this moview."
4,No UltraViolet,Great Movie. It's got everything you want to see in an superhero action flick. The only complaint I have is that I want a cloud based digital copy. I don't have iTunes. I do have a desktop PC and Laptop. I guess I can download this onto a thumb drive but I want a universal cloud solution. These production companies need to get together and decide on how they are going to issue digital copies.
4,Avengers Review,"The Avengers is a movie that will satisfy comic book fans from 6-60 years old. All of the expected cliche's are there, with a few scenes unexpectedly stolen from the big stars."
2,not dvd player compatible,"As far as the movie its self it is one of the best I have ever watched, Now as far as the DVD goes it will not play on my DVD player on my TV. It would only play on my laptop. So unless you want this I would not purchase this DVDDanny"
1,Avengers,What a let down! What a poorly written film! The whole team up of characters made a boring movie because the story was so lame. All the other Marvel films with one hero was written much better. Someone really dropped the ball.
1,Horrible packaging...,I saw this movie in the theaters and absolutely loved it! One of the must have movies so right after i watched it i preordered it on amazon.When I opened up the packaging I was in disbelief. The discs were stacked one on top of another so that there were 4 disks in 2 slots. A real pain to get out and i'm pretty sure that I am going to end up with scratched disks because of this poor packaging. I completely regret getting the 4 disc copy due to how much I loved the movie.
2,This got two stars in my book for one reason. The audio track was simply way too low.,"With volume pumped all the way up and wearing headphones I could still barely hear.The movie was great although typical Marvel fast-action, lot of explosions kind of fare, I enjoyed it.The sound volume ruined the experience."
5,Exceeds expectations in every way,"Finally! A superhero movie that's an unapologetic reproduction of the story you would see in a real comic book! All the same cheesy dialogue and witty one-liners we would see in a comic overlaid above a surprisingly well-written and intelligent story on a very large scale. This is what you may have missed if you aren't into comics, or set them aside with your youth.There is nothing anyone could say is bad about this movie. It is well done in every way, superbly acted, visually stunning and a lot of good old-fashioned fun. The sets are highly detailed, the visual effects are outstanding and the story moves without pause to a climax that you would not see coming if you haven't already heard about it.Lots of action, lots of laughs, lots of awesome visuals, lots of fun for the young and young-at-heart. Must-see."
3,"Good movie, but 3D effects disappointing.","I bought this movie specifically for the 3D effects. Very disappointing. I have several IMAX 3D blu ray discs at home and their 3D effects are just amazing. Most stores use them to showcase their 3D TV's. So, I use that as a standard when comparing 3D blu ray discs.Well, this movie falls way short of that standard. It appears to be a 2D movie converted to 3D, as opposed to being originally filmed in 3D. As a result, the 3D effects don't ""pop"" out of the screen as much. There's definitely no WOW factor. I enjoyed the movie, but was very disappointed with the 3D effects. If you like this movie, save your money and just buy the 2D version.Would have given it a better rating than 3 stars if it had better 3D."
5,my favorite movie of 2012,this is what a super hero movie should be I enjoyed it I would not buy the dvd if I did not like it.
2,Didn't do it for me...,"I didn't go gaga over this movie. You know you don't like a movie too much if you begin multi-tasking as you watch it. My best friends love it and have seen it a bunch a times. I guess it depends on personal taste. Didn't much enjoy the Iron Man 2 either; prefer the first one. I prefer Ghost Rider, The Punisher, and others."
2,$34.32 For Something I Can't Watch,"My BD player is broken, so I was hoping to watch this on my computer either the Digicopy or the DVD. No media player I have (VLC or WMP) will play either disc.What is up with that?"
1,My product never reached,"Mi producto nunca llego, he verificado con el transportador y me indican que los datos de envio se encuentran mal, por ese motivo nunca llego, es necesario que por favor corrigan esto y envien mi producto a la direccion solicitada."
1,Where was the sound?,I rented this through Amazon on demand and the sound quality was horrible. When watching regular TV I have the sound volume set at 14. With this movie I had to set the volume all the way up to 30. Even then we had to lean forward to hear the dialogue. Forget all of the action scenes. They were no louder than a conversation. Surround sound didn't help. This ruined a great movie and turned me off to ever using Amazon to stream again. They still haven't responded to my original complaint I filed weeks ago.
5,Great Movie,"If you're reading reviews about this movie you already have a good idea what it's about. I'll simply say...rent it, and if you're the type that likes to watch great movies of this genre more than once, buy it. You won't be disappointed, and you'll want to see this one in preparation for a great sequel. 5 stars."
4,"""The Avengers"" Blu-ray Review","It is kind of weird, the first time I had seen the cover for this blu - ray some months ago, I was freaking pist; I wanted to yell, but I was in a public place. But then I bought the movie, and I really like the cover now, could better but, it is good. The Movie ""The Avengers"" is amazing, it gets a 5 out of 5, and the movie on blu ray is more then perfect, the movie on blu ray is th main reason that this blu - ray is a must buy. There is not much of special features, which dissapoints me, but it has some and one very good deleted scenes, the awesome one involving Cap., and a very cool short film that I enjoyed. Overall I would give this blu ray as a whole 4.5 out of 5 stars. I would like to have hours of how the film was made, but the movie is so good on Blu ray that you must have it, so get it."
5,Action,loved the movie. all heroes together was great to see lots of action fun scenes good image played well. I would watch it again cause it was entertaining
3,"Wonder Woman, missing in action.","Granted, Marvel is all about the guys. I miss you Wonder Woman. You were, for us girls, the only heroine. You were beautiful, brave, and there to protect us from the evil ones of the world. Today's ""heroes"" blow up stuff and kill people. Superman, Batman, The Green Hornet turned the bad people over to the police for justice to triumph."
4,the typical summer comic book movie,"The Avengers was much more entertaining than I had anticipated. Iron Man 1 was excellent, but I was disappointed with the remaining movies leading up to Avengers. However it all comes together in this movie. The characters and plot do not fee forced. If you are a fan of the comic book genre then I highly recommend Avengers. If your not, or only a little, then you may wan to pass."
3,Review of Marvel's The Avengers,"Not as good as I expected. Good for the kids, but not satisfying enough for adults. However, CGI was outstanding..."
3,Haven't We Seen This Before,"This is another case of over-hype. When it was out in the theaters and then later when it was released on DVD people were clamoring and slobbering with praise over this thing. I waited a while before watching it. What a disappointment for me!Nothing really new here. A few clever quips, a lot of boring filler dialog, and overkill on the effects and everything else. I'm glad I saw it, but I was yawning and antsy for the whole mess to end. Weren't some of the same effects and scenes in other bad movies like TRANSFORMERS: DARK SIDE OF THE MOON? It all looked familiar.Robert Downey Jr carries this film. The dumb haughty-speaking Asgards, Loki and Thor, were rather annoying. ""Shakespeare in the park"" is what Ironman refers to them as--yes, apt description.Effect-laden, rambling-speeched, blah-blah-blah. This film could have had an hour or so trimmed from it and it would have been more tolerable. Sometimes more is not better, it's just more."
4,good movie,"lot of fun and ties right in with the other marvel films i thoroughly enjoyed it, it starts off slow but makes up for it in the end"
3,great movie,"love it, greatest movie of the year.5 stars cuase it is awsome!so buy+ you get a free digital comic (Avengers Assemble 1) and a free poster ($3.95 shipping) with the remediable code."
5,Joss Whedon does it again.,We really enjoyed this movie - The Hulk stole the show! I've always been a fan of Joss Whedon! I hope he makes an Avengers 2.
3,Fairly easy to read score,"The English font isn't always easy to read. The notes for the English text are crammed in with the original notes paired with the French, and therefore, are difficult to pick out at times.Clear, bold print. Binding threatens come undone eventually, but still impressed with product. Clear table of contents. No unnecessary pages with essays and the like."
5,Historic Event,"I can't help but love this book. No other ""event"" ever done by DC Comics came close to having the impact that CRISIS did. In 12 issues, the entire history of the DC universe was re-written. In every issue, major & minor characters died, or were changed forever. This series featured the death of Supergirl, who has not been seen in DC continuity since. (Okay, yes a Supergirl is in the current comics, but not the same one) The silver age Flash, Barry Allen, also bit the dust here. But the series is not monumental just because of the high body count. This series condensed all of the very convoluted histories of the DC characters (most of which had several co-existing versions) into single histories. CRISIS was a major starting point for a whole new DC Universe. Nothing has been the same since. A must read for any DC Comics fan."
2,CRISIS ON INFINITE WHAT???,"It started out as a great book. Then it got into the whole multiple earths thing and then to make it more confusing they introduced characters that had nothing to do with the plot. Don't get me wroung, it was a great idea for a book it just needed to stick to the game plan. I did enjoy the multiple characters meeting themselves and the heros of other world fighting eachother. They ruind that idea though by haveing them be brain washed. That was dumb. Overall it was OK. I wouldn't read it again though."
3,Good story. All DC universe history revolves around this epic. Too much at one time though.,"I went ahead and reread Crisis on infinite earths about 6 months before Infinite Crisis (the sequel that came out the end of 2005), to make sure I was up to speed on the story. A lot of comments came to my mind as I finished it up...To much to fast in too little a time.Crisis on infinite earths originally was a 12 issue run but should have been 14-16 issues. It feels poorly edited and you constantly are feeling like you are missing something.Overall, the story is fun to read though and enjoyable but could have been done better. If there ever was a ""writer's cut"" of a comic book this should have been it. Still, I do recommend it to readers especially those that read DC comics regularly."
2,not the best,"my mother said it was ok, the sound was not good had to keep turning volume up and down, overall ok"
4,Very knowledgeable,"If you are worried about way far out stuff being a part of SM, this should put your fears to rest, however it gets a bit boring, going over each item and issue a little too long."
1,The clueless trying to lead the clueless!,"It's hard to believe that this book or author has developed a following. All I can think is that people out there are even more clueless than this author. If this guide is ""realistic"" I'd hate to know what an unrealistic attitude is. The book's focus seems to be on what the people the author plays with think is exciting. Typical arrogance for a newbie, but really grating in someone who bills himself as a long-time player. For practical how-to advice try SCREW THE ROSES, SEND ME THE THORNS, and for intellectual stimulation anything by Gloria Brame or Pat Califia are heads and shoulders above this 3d rate manual."
1,lame....seriously lame,"Jay Wiseman is unfortunaly a popular writer. Far to many scene people buy this book and quote it like the bible. It is silly, childish and if you actually followed his instructions no play would ever take place. Absolutely not worth the money."
5,Highly recommended for newbies and old heads alike.,Jay Wisemans knowledge both medically and personal contribute to this book on a large scale. Mine is highlighted and dog eared.
4,A good place to start for the timid,"Wiseman covers the ground pretty well and if you know nothing it's a place to start. He does as someone else pointed out err on the side of safety, but better that than be irresponsible. He has been around a long time and is respected within the scene, (although known for being a bit windy in his demos)Of course the whole ""safe, sane and consentual"" idea is a bit bizarre. Little that most of us do for fun is safe, and more hikers die every year than BDSM players. Personally, I prefer R.A.C.K., Risk Advised Consentual Kink, as do many others."
4,A good book for working out the kinks,"I first used this book in a creative writing class in college. At the time, I thought,""Yeah, well and good, but what has it got to do with real writing?""It has a lot to do with it, actually. I've used favorite techniques that I learned in this book in several published pieces, as well as in the book that I'm currently marketing. The sections are short, the exercises relevant, and the layout is graduated from simple to complex. I turn to this book when I'm stuck about how to present a given scene with the most punch, and it has never failed to help me think a situation through.There are better books on writing out there, to be sure, but this compact book is a very good place to start, and I use it quite often.Bret WrightAuthor"

3,"Starts good, lags in the middle, and picks up steam later on","I really loved Sleep's Holy Mountain, and couldn't wait to get a hold of Dopesmoker. I kept on hearing that it was like Holy Mountain times 90, and much slower and heavier. Well, after a lot of listenings, it has it's ups and downs.1)The riffs are awesome, that is true. The beginning riff is so simple, yet so heavy, you have to stand in awe. Also, the riff after the slow sitar-thing is great.2)The vocals are irritating. They sound like a barbarian doing opera. It's ridiculous.3)The song starts to lose steam in the middle, and has too much singing. Also, the riffs aren't as good as the earlier ones.4)Things pick up and never lose steam after the 2nd guitar solo.5)It's not as slow and heavy as people say it is. Electric Wizard was slower. AND heavier.Anyway, it's a good song, but I prefer Holy Mountain. Also, there is a cool bonus track called Sonic Titan that rules. If you enjoy Electric Wizard and Holy Mountain, this is for you."
5,Inspiring and practical,"What I like most about the book Nonviolent Communication is how clearly and convincingly it shows, by explanation and examples, how to communicate, especially in potential or actual conflicts.Nonviolent Communication is much easier to read than to live, but it's so important, I believe, to keep remembering to apply the important lessons in Marshall Rosenberg's book. If we all communicated this way, how much more wonderful a world this would be!"
1,Disappointing,"I read the first two books of this series and I enjoyed them. Not as well written as Elrod's solo books, but enjoyable and fast paced, nonetheless. This book was just plain silly. And the ending? OK, I get it, you want to end the series. But it was just plain silly."
1,Sounds flat-out lazy.,"I was expecting so much more from Drudkh. I own all of their previous albums and they are one of my favorite atmospheric black metal bands. So, I heard they were doing an all-acoustic album and was stoked. Well, listening to this music put out that fire. This is a black/metal band doing Ukranian Folk songs, for me it doesn't work. Way too repetitive and boring. The playing is lazy and uninspired. Although, some I know like this, if I was going to buy this, I would definitely want to hear it first.(something I didn't do) I strongly suggest that people listen first, before you buy."
5,An incredible bargin and invaluable resource,What an incredible bargin! A reasonably priced book that includes the Outlook 98 software and covers topics I couldn't find anywhere else. This book is an excellent reference and has answered all of my questions about using Outlook 98. It follows a logical sequence covering topics in the order I needed them moving from basic information to advanced application. This is the only book I've found that tells me explicitly how to use and customize Outlook for my business.
1,Awful!,"I ordered the product on 08/11, after a couple of calls to ""customer service"" and several unanswered emails I received the product 09/10. It was bent. I am returning product ASAP! I doubt I 'll order there again...worst customer service I have receiced in a while."
2,Broke before install,"I bought 4 on amazon and three installed with ease. However, the base easily came off of the welded screw on the 4rth one before the install, so I could not use the last one. They are beautiful and quite stunning as well as practical. I went to Lowe's and they sell the same exact brass magnetic doorstop ($5.69) but with a different type of internal post/screw/base that is much better engineered, where the weld will not come apart. I now prefer to buy these locally in the event they break and I can quickly return. I need 5 more."
3,Finish is fading,"These were beautiful at first, but slowly have began fading. They work fine and are durable, easy to install. Good purchase for the price. They dont look bad, just not as bright as when purchased. I would still recommend."
5,Nice Guys CAN Finish First In Business,"Love it, love it, love it. Finally an empowering business book for those of us who don't believe you have to be a soulless, emotionally retarded cheeseball prick to succeed in the business world. Danny Meyer's financial results give ample validity to his approach, so while you can still get rich the ""traditional"" way, his experience supports the fact that you can also get rich AND make the world a better place. Gets a little blah towards the end, but all of my stars, underlines and dogears throughout the beginning and middle parts more than make up for that. Others will do a better job of dissecting and analyzing the book in detail, so that's it for me. If you're tired of getting the beat-down for having the gall to have ""feelings"" at work, you'll love this book."
3,softrock,"to be honest this is one of the best collection music from the 70-80's but the list music do not mach with the cd playing list ,I think is a factory error. and some cd's are on the wrom case .- for such a great music collection. plus they miss a lot of the best of 70-80'' like castle in the air don mclean. bob seger maint street-againt the wing. and many many moore classic song's '.for this price all those songs should be includ it.ist's a sham"
4,It fits okay and works.,"I bought this hose because it was the cheapest one I could find for my Jeep. I don't always believe that paying the most gets you the best, but you also sometimes get what you pay for. This feels less rigid than the original. I also had to bend the steel tubing some to make it fit right, and doesn't have the same protective sleeve as the original. It should do the job ok, but time will tell if it lasts."
4,It's OK,"I bought this heater thinking it had a temperature switch, it doesn't, that is the disappointing part I am currently working in Afghanistan, in the mountains i live in a tiny room about 6x6 it gets to hot then i have to shut it off, then it gets cold in the room so i have to turn it on again, it really stinks when its 2 or 3am and have to click it on or off, if the room was bigger i think this heater would be ideal. I am still happy i have it!"
1,Not the Ellen Burstyn Movie,"To answer the other reviewer's question, this is not the Ellen Burstyn, Sam Shepard version. At least not based on the date. This one has a date of 1988. The Ellen Burstyn version of this fine file was released in 1980.Keep looking...the movie is worth it!Shame on Amazon for not putting enough information on this film. If you have them in stock you should at least be able to describe them to your customers."
3,"Is this the Ellen Burstyn ""Resurrection""?",How about a little description Amazon? At least a partial cast list?
1,Not the Ellen Burstyn film!!!,"This film is not the one starring Ellen Burstyn, do not buy it if that's what you are looking for."
1,"There may be life beyond death, but no life in this movie",Very typical B movie pretending to be serious and spiritual. Suitable for T.V ( i mean day-time ).
2,Not so good,"I have been looking for a good video product about PMC to share with my glass class and am very disappointed by this DVD. The production values are pretty poor and overall it is just a decent effort for amateurs. It is not something that I can run in a class. Oh! well, the search continues."
5,Great tool.,"I needed this tool to make my best version of a fine piece of furniture. The cheaper models seemed to be just that- cheap. The expensive models were just plain out of my budget. After dropping this one and knocking it all out of whack, it corrected itself when I screwed it completely together. The directions for use are clear and the marked lines for use are easy to see. I highly recommend this tool. It's tough, easy to use and really gives your woodworking projects a clean look and durability regular old screws envy."
5,Love My Groundhog!,I love groundhogs and this puppet was the closest that I could find to the real thing! Love it. He is so adorable.
2,trouble installing the scanner driver,"I run windows ME (DELL Dimension 4100). I have spent 10 hrs trying to install this scanner. I have spoken to Canon respresentatives as well. I am not sure if its my USB port. But, the port works fine with a printer or a cable modem. May be it requires more current.I am almost giving up. May be I'll try getting a powered USB hub and see if it will work. Actually, I like the scanner. It looks cool and would love to see it work.Who knows, may be one of you might help me out.Note: I have tried 3 different scanners from 2 different manufacturers. None of them install under ME."
3,Scanner,"Gentlemen,I have not used this equipment because I did not recieve the installation disk. ThanksDaniel Sanchez"
2,Canon N1220U Scanner,"Good scanner when it's working. I have had nothing but problems with the software under Windows 2000. One day it will be working, the next day ""Unable to open TWAIN source."" Countless times unconnecting/reconnecting, unloading/reloading the software yields occasional success. Canon tech support is useless. Good hardware without good software is pointless. This scanner/software is nothing but frustration."
5,teaching individuality to children,"This is a wonderful way to deal with a child's desire to be ""like everyone else"". It takes the characters through the absurdity of trying to keep up with changing fashion. Extremely well done and very entertaining."
4,better than the first one,"Although I really enjoyed APC's first cd it doesn't even compare to this one. I'd have to say Maynard is a vocal genius who brings life into every one of their songs. More of an APC fan than of Tool I loved this album with it's more mellow tracks such as The Noose and The Nurse who Loved me. The songs on this cd drag you into the music and you can feel the raw emotions expressed in the general sound of the songs. I certainly reccomend this to anyone and everyone, even if they aren't usually a Tool or APC fan. Anyone who has any love for music will see that this isn't just a cd but a piece of art."
5,Second review,"After listening to the CD for a 6th or 7th time, the lyrics and music stick in my head and remain there throughout the night. The only way to satisfy my craving is to listen to the CD again! It's awesome, like someone said, it's no Mer de Noms, I dont know if anything can top that album, it is flawless. But this one is distinct and unique. Weak and Powerless is a powerful song, and Gravity is quickly becoming one of my favorite if not my favorite track. Its incredible, listen to the lyrics, the music, it wrentches your heart! Maynards voice flows so well with the music. A remarkable piece of work here. A must buy!"
2,How disappointing!!,"After every Tool Cd, and APC's 1st, I have come to expect a more impressive effort from Maynard. The songs are all missing a lot of feeling. Over trying to make a classic,maybe. This CD is just plain EMPTY! No powerful words, sounds or vocals. I like 3 songs on this, and none of those compare to anything else MJK has ever done."
5,Another great cd from maynard!,"I loved this cd, ok maybe not as much as the first, but its still the best cd i've bought in months. tracks 3, 4 and 10 , noose, blue, and pet are amazing. the nurse who loved me seems a little... different, but it is a cover, and i think its growing on me. anyway, it a perfect circle, enough said, great cd!"
4,Good,"I am excited to see bands cover songs written by Failure. If anyone likes ""The nurse who loved me"" check out the original version on Failures Cd titled , ""fantastic Planet"" . Also there is a band called the Replicants who has a cd of all cover songs and features members from Failure and Tool. Good APC album pick it up"
3,Less inspired,"Besides a few compellingly put together segments and overall art-rock competence, the songwriting does not sound nearly as concise as their effective debut, nor does it deliver a unifying whole as presented."
3,Goth Ambience,"A Perfect Circle's sophomore effort Thirteenth Step is so consistent it's like fruitcake: thick with mysterious ingredients, and each slice is impossible to tell apart from the others. This is one of those packages more effective whole than song-by-song. The general vibe is goth ambience, bass heavy, closer to the prog-rock of Maynard James Kennan's Tool than this side project had once portended. Kennan's vocals are sweeter here than in Tool's dark progressive rock - he keeps close to his upper register throughout. And though the songs tend to bleed into each other (and ""bleed"" is the operative word), stuff does stick out. ""Blue"" is the best song the Cure never wrote. ""The Nurse Who Loved Me"", a chamber waltz, is the prettiest tune of infidelity I've heard in some time. And the rest is murky, bittersweet, sinister. Break out the fishnets and eyeliner."
4,"Thirteenth Step, music for everyone","This album is great for anyone, no matter what kind of music you like. There's mellow and heavy parts making it very interesting to listen to. If you're sick of having to keep skiping through songs and you would like to get a cd you can listen to the whole way through, this is it! Also if you haven't picked it up, try out Mer De Noms by A Perfect Circle also."
5,Best Album of 2003,"Mere words cannot describe the beauty contained within ""Thirteenth Step"". I have been a fan of APC since I saw them open for NIN, and I was eagerly awaiting this albums arrival. Well I was not disappointed. Maynards dreamy voice combinded with the melodies contained within, are so intense, you can find yourself being carried off with the music. Jeordie White is an incredible musician, and I think that this album shows off just what he can do. My favorite selections would have to be ""The Package"", ""The Outsider"", and ""Pet"". All of which have a darker heavier beat then what I was expecting, but they turn out to be the best songs!"
4,"Not what I expected at all, it's amazing....","When I heard Weak and Powerless on the radio I was worried it was a new sound and I wasnt so sure this cd would be all that Mer de noms was, and I was right, this is different! and oh so good. Mellow, haunting, these songs are awesome. In my mind the first APC album was mellow and calm so this fits right in with it, but they are nothing alike. Maynard is seriously a musical master most ppl are lucky to get one awesome band, he has 2. This cd is definitly worth a few bucks.... It'll pay for itself with an emotional ride."
5,J'invoque le Génie et la Perfection!,"La musique de Billy Howerdel, ex-ingénieur de son de David Bowie, et les paroles de Maynard James Keenan, le chanteur incomparable de ""Tool"", fusionnent pour enfanter un des plus magnifiques albums de Rock Alernatif jamais produit. Ce disque forme un tout très cohérent bien que la recherche sonore oblige à une écoute répétitive avant d'en apprécier réellement les nuances complexes.Acheter cet album maintenant!"
2,understandable,"Dont get me wrong i love maynard and what he's doing with TooL but as i listened to the album i could only point out a few songs that caught my attention. im a musician, and i know all the members of the band are very talented but what was produced on this album was not expected, if you're a diehard APC fan or crazy about maynard buy the album, but coming from a song writers point of view they gave it a shot and we can at least give them that. i still belive maynard is still one of the greatest vocalist of all time. i titled this review ""understandable"" because it is. maynard is frontman for two unique bands and it is hard enough being an important part of both of them."
1,Who is in this band!? Tell us Amazon!,"Remember when there was CD now? THere you could read all about the band, Like whos in it etc. Now that we have Amazon, there is no such information! Amazon sucks!!! Is James Iha in Perfect Circle? Thats all I want to know! Do you see this Amazon! Start giving more information about the cds!"
5,ITS INCREDIBLE,if u wanna hear music that means something if you enjoy being touched deeply or entertained at all moments or soothed of life get this cd its beautiful its so beautiful
5,Great Album,"A Perfect Circle's latest product, Thirteenth Step, is an incredible album. The great lyrics and the band's overall musicality results in an album filled with melodic and expressive tracks.The lyrics are very powerful, as Maynard James Keenan explores deep and dark issues of the human mind, including drug abuse and suicide. Maynard takes the listener on an emotional ride using different tones and feelings in his vocals.Most of the songs are very delicate and poignantly melodic, such as in ""The Noose."" There are also a few heavier songs, such as ""The Outsider."" This is, in my opinion, the most powerful song in the album, with Maynard expressing himself through his aggressive vocals.This is a great album overall, and I would highly recommend it to anyone."
5,The sequel...,"This must one of the best CD of the year. Well I may not be unbiased because I alredy loved the first album. This one is different from the first one, more quiet, but so rich. Each song is full of treasures of sounds which you don't hear in the first time. Maynard, the singer keeps singing so well... I needed to listen to it many times to love it like Mer De Noms. Even if you don't like alternative rock or metal, I recommend you this album, because I think anyone can like it.And I saw them live last saturday... Never seen such a good band live..."
4,Very Nice... enough.,"Yes, this is a great APC album, so stop asking and just by it. That said, this album is sure to disappoint the listeners wanted more heft and less sonic beauty. Well, tough. The cover of Failure's ""The Nurse Who Loved Me"" is great, but as a reinvention, not a straight cover (hear the original and decide for yourself).Check out the Underworld Soundtrack for similar new music and auditory joys."
5,A much anticipated and cd,A perfect Circle is one of the best bands ever and this cd is an awesome follow up to Mer De Noms far better than the first cd. Lots of love too the band and Maynard. Can't wait to see the concert!!!
1,not so perfect circle,"This CD is sort of boring. I was expecting a lot more from such a talented group of musicians. This album lacks the passion, energy and drive of the first One. I suppose if you're looking for a good CD to fall asleep to, buy it, but if you like your albums to rockout a little, save your money."
4,Intriguing but seems Maynardless,"The album sounds beautiful at parts. I've yet to digest the whole thing. I havn't read the vocal information yet, but I could swear that the vocals aren't Maynard. They aren't bad but it's definately different sounding than the first album. I'm gonna say buy it and enjoy it for yourself. It's rare nowadays to get a decent rock album. I also wanted to say that the actions taken recently by the RIAA are unjust and they will fall. The consumer will consume when they are ready, right now the economy is not ready, the music produced lately has been shallow and pointless and you are only making it worse for yourself by taking actions against your core consumer. EFF forever!"
3,Most original track on the album...A COVER SONG,"It's Interesting in the rolling stone review and in a review I read here both stated that ""The Nurse who loved me"" is the ""best song on the album"" rolling stone, or ""The most original song on the album"" Reviewer, and this song is acutually a cover song of a band called ""Failure"" (The greatest band ever i might add)Maynard was a big fan of ""Failure"" and on the cd-rom bit of the new ""Year of the Rabbit"" album Billy Howerdell interviews Ken Andrews who is the lead singer of Both bandscheck them out"
4,"Excellent album, I prefer the more edgy sound of Tool.","I gave it 4.5 stars! Great album, lryics are deep, thought provoking, inspiring. Music sounds good, sounds alot like Tool. Makes sense why the songs would, but whats missing is Tool's drummer and ""other guitarist"", and those two ROCK! They take the music to another level thats not quite reached here in my humble opinion."
5,The Second Time's the Charm,"Wow, I did not see this coming at all. ""Mer de Noms,"" A Perfect Circle's freshman release, was a nice but unoriginal compilation of over-produced eighties-type metal that had the benefit of Maynard James Keenan on vocals. ""Thirteenth Step,"" however, sounds like a different band altogether. In this time of bubble-gum pop and hip hop and punk-metal, I cannot tell you how refreshing it is to hear such a quiet and beautiful rock record. You'll be amazed not only by the notes played but by the stunning silence in between. Soft guitars and mournful sounds and Keenan's moving voice all weave and build to bright explosions of power and emotion. Yes, it rocks, but the foreplay is long and deliciously intense. It's a brave band that can take composing as seriously as what is on display here--and can take the listener seriously enough to take the ride with them. If you enjoy avant-garde rock, do not miss this one."
5,Almost as good as Tool,"Being a big Tool fan (Lateralus was awesome!!!), I was sort of skeptical that I would like APC as much. After listining to a lot of clips and songs from it, I decided to get it. Here's what I think:The forst song, The Package, really grows on you. It's the best description of an addiction I've ever seen. Maynard actually SOUNDS like he can't control himself and that he NEEDS this thing to survive. The slow buildup puts this into effect, too.The Outsider, I think, is genious. I agree with MOST of the lyrics in the song and I enjoy the ""in your face"" style in which it's sung.Other standout tracks are: Weak and Powerless, Blue, A Stranger, and Pet."
4,"Saw them live, WOW","I love the CD, but for some reason the live versions of the 13th Step songs have a different character live, it's almost like the songs truly come alive out on the road. There's an APC import floating around called ""Live at the Odeon."" I suggest you guys check it out if you're lucky enough to locate a copy. If you have any questions about the APC live experience or this CD, feel free to email me at dbermudez@hotmail.com"
5,Another example of music/emotions at it's best,"Once again, Billy Howerdell, Maynard James Keenan, and Josh Freese have crafted a truly beautiful piece of art. These songs show an even deeper side to the band. Billy's use of textured guitar tracks and Maynards abstract, deep lyrics literally take you to another place. I have spent hours with headphones on getting lost inside of this album. My personal favorites as of right now are ""The Package"" and ""Pet"". I promise you will not be dissapointed with this album. If you are not already a die hard fan, you soon will be! Be smart and buy the album to support the band! Don't burn it or swipe it from Kazaa. If we don't support these bands and buy there CD's they will not be able to afford make a living entertaining us! Where would we be without the music we love and live for? Hats off to APC."
4,13th Step is a Success,One complaint I've heard about this album is how mellow 13th step is compared to the last APC cd. I agree with that statement but I think 13th Step is better than the last. Forget about the radio. Listen to the 3rd track entitled Noose. This song may be the best song I've heard in a long time. The entire cd has deep meaning for anyone who may be battling their own demons and is perfect for those days you dont want to get up and do anything. Just throw in this cd and relax. I personally cannot wait for the next cd from APC.
4,A Puzzling Thirteenth Step,"This album puzzles me from start to finish. The opening track ""The Package"" is a good one but doesn't seem to be right track for the opener to the album. Perhaps the 10th track ""Pet"" which is the most powerful track on the album belongs in it's place.""The Nurse Who Loved Me"" seems completely out of place on this album and is simply annoying, and while the closer ""Gravity"" is great song, it belongs more towards the middle of the album.""Thirteenth Step"" is an album that is a bit unaccessible and as a result requires two or three spins, and while it at times is heavier than its predecessor ""Mer De Noms"" fillers like ""The Nurse Who Loved Me"", and ""The Noose"" bring it down a bit. Nonetheless, this album is still worth purchasing if you like a perfect circle... ORESTESStandouts on the album are:""Pet""""Weak & Powerless""""The Outsider""""The Package""""Gravity"""
4,Mer De Noms... better,"This album is awesome, don't get me wrong, but I prefer Mer De Noms over Thirteenth Step. I think A Perfect Circle should have had more hard tracks, and whats up with the two tracks that are about 5 seconds long hmm?Anyway, yes I DO recommend this album for any fan of theirs because it is a great album."
4,"Once again, APC has done it","APC again comes out with yet another well done CD. its still to early for me to deceide which one is better. I have listened to it 3 times so far since ive gotten it. If you liked the first APC cd (Mer De Noms), then you should definetly pick this one up. i waited a while for it, and let me tell you it was worth the wait. there are 1 or 2 songs that i thought though, they could of done a better job with, but it still overeall very well donw. pick this cd up, you wont be disappointed.JOHN"
4,Comparison,"I dont really want to post a review but more of a complaint on when people compare perfect circle to tool saying things like the band would be better with so and so or if they had the sound of tool... I dont know if those that have mentioned these things noticed that thay are 2 different bands, a perfect circle and Tool, so to compare them or say they should sound like tool is very dumb.ronniejamesdio_holydiver@yahoo.com"
1,Norse mythology??,"Anyone who has more than the briefest aquaintance with Norse mythology will find this book laughable- and a good laugh is all one should expect from it. Flights of fantasy wrapped around the basic myths do not do justice to a rich heritage.Do yourself a favor, and get one of the other, better beginner's collections such as Norse Myths by Crossley-Holland or R.I. Page."
1,Almost insulting,"This book does not provide any sort of accurate depiction of the Northern European mythology and folklore that many of us enjoy reading about.Not only does this book not provide an accurate translation of many of the tales and gods, but the author combines the stories with his own unfounded opinions of the religion.He says numerous times in the book that the ancient Icelanders never actually believed in any of the tales they told, that everything was simply a story, and their pseudo-religion proves that.In addition he refers to them as ""Aryans."" Considering this term didn't come about until the psychic Madam Blavatsky started using it in the late nineteenth century, and it wasn't even an accurate term, I found it a bit confusing and annoying.I simply could not refer a worse and more inaccurate book to read on this beautiful subject."
4,Important Work For Anyone Interested in Crime & Punishment,"This is a memoir of life in prison by an articulate old man who committed a horrible senseless crime as a teenager. The notorious murder of an innocent boy naturally shocked the nation then - - as the Columbine shootings shock us today. What makes this book interesting is that it is not an effort to excuse a crime, but an effort at describing prison life. In this case prison life was nearly an entire life. I think it is a shame that it is out of print. Particularly, since the topic of how to punish, rehabilitate or retrain yourthful offenders seems a fresh topic. There are not many other books that give as frank an assessment of what happens after the trial. I think it worth reading."
4,Air Mattress Repair,"I used this product on my queen size air mattress, and I assume I glued the correct side of the patch material as the patch is still holding."
4,It worked!,"I had bad luck with my airbed. There was a hole right next to the valve stitching and I tried bicycle repair kit and some random patch kit from a crafts store, but no luck. I even tried the famous duct tape :)This product worked however! I was pretty dubious first, when the piece of vinyl didn't seem to attach properly around the hole, but when I used plenty of glue and let it dry about a day, it stuck nicely and seems to be airtight now! Great value, especially if you have an expensive airbed that is broken!The package had no instructions whatsoever..."
1,Not enough art and too short,"Unlike the other reviewers I do NOT recommend buying this book. The artwork of Alex Ross is great (of course) but there is just too little of it. Plus, the storyline of the origins of the JLA just did not cut it. Each origin is told through a series of 8 panels that are 8""x2"", plus each origin is in a single color (except for the last panel in each). I was very disappointed that the storyline was so short for each origin. There is also a great group shot near the back of the book, but superman and some of batman fall right in the crease. I was very disappointed. You are much better off putting the money towards MYTHOLOGY (The DC Comics Art of Alex Ross). It has much of the same art from origin of JLA plus there is a lot more art for your money. In short, I don't recommend purchasing the book JLA: Secret Origins, its just not worth it."
3,space?,spacey sounding music about space? Did I miss the space shuttle to planet little luann or something?
3,TV Excorcist,"A couple's child is posseseed by the devil. Hardly original this made-for-TV movie at least explored the Excorcist theme when The Exorcist was only available at movie theaters.Now it is a bit of nostalgia. A highlight is Dan O'Hearly playing the priest.At times its kind of funny like when furniture flies at the priest trying to excorcise the demon. It looked like people out of camera range were throwing things away from the priest. Does the Devil have extremely bad aim?Still if you like old '70s horror like I do, you'll enjoy it."
3,The black experience refracted through a white author,"I do not fault Kevin Baker for his work, which is admirable. But why is serious fiction concerning black Americans given far more exposure (i.e., The Sunday New York Times Book Section) when refracted through the prism of a white author? It is as if the vision of black writers - particularly black male writers - is somehow counterfeit or less trustworthy. In other words, it is not ""legitimate"" unless it is coming from a white writer. I will not be promoting this book to any black reading groups, as too many worthy black writers cannot get the marketing and promotional support of the publishing industry."
3,JUST A BAD PHOTO OF SASHA!,"The photo does no justice for sasha, she looks ten times prettyer on the bratz website- also, this may be a myscene copy,but it still looks cool, has it ever occured to you that the manufacturers are not making as big as a deal as all you teeny bopper customers? Think about that!MYSCENE AND BRATZ ARE BOTH COOL!"
1,No more Money upgrades for me,"Last year I had to recreate my Money file when upgrading to Money 2005 due to a file conversion problem. It was a major pain but I wrote it off to a ""one-time"" error. This year I downloaded the trial version before paying out for the new version. Glad I tried it first. It doesn't work. Any online payments with brackets in the name (Money's silly way of differentiating two payees with the same name) refuse to work. And, of course, customer support won't help me since it is a trial version. They won't even tell me if my problem is a known problem. The rep told me to buy the full version if I want customer support. Why in the world would I buy a broken product? So I went back to Money 2005 and my online payments work again. That's it. I'm done. No more upgrades of Money. When I need new features I will switch to Quicken."
1,NOT HAPPY,"I had Money 2005 working with my pocket PC 2003, but recently had to change to windows mobile 5.0. Unfortunately Money 2005 doesn't work with windows mobile 5.0. I was told by Microsoft that Money 2006 doesn't either, but Money 2007 would. Now that Money 2007 is out, they are now telling me that Money will NEVER be compatible with windows mobile 5.0. It was very hard to get a straight answer from them!"
1,Painful to use,"To do _anything_ in the program you must sign up for a MS passport account. Even once you do, MS Money has problems logging into it. After all of the passport hassle, I discovered that it provided absolutely zero benefits.MS Money is also built around internet explorer, so anything and everything that makes internet explorer evil will also manifest itself in Money.I tried Money because Quicken is too focused on promoting other products, making it seem like a big commercial, but Money is no different."
5,from anger to forgiveness,It was just what I needed in my life at the time. I read it twice and highlighted areas that were important to me. I passed it on to a friend.
5,great stuff,"i purchased this album on a whim, and i don't regret it. slick, smooth as hell psy-trance with a fat analog sound. get it!"
4,Image quality suffers,"I loved how small and simple the scanner was, and not having supplementary power was a big bonus. But when I compared the images side by side with those from a Epson Perfection 640U, you could see a difference. The canoscan images were just a little less sharp and the image tone in black and white scans was a little warmer. Plus, the speed was significantly slower."
5,It is still alive!,"I purchased it from a military post exchange AAFES store in Germany in December 2000. Now it is December 2010. I thought I should review this legacy product on Amazon, even though I did not buy it from here. It has been 10 long years and this scanner is still function as it did when it was new. It survived my move from overseas back to US and several change of station moves. Operation is simple. A single USB cord takes care of the job powering the unit and transferring scanned data. As far as value for money is concerned, this is the best electronic product I have ever purchased. Not many electronic products can survive 10 years and remain useful."
1,Canon N650U USB flatbed Scanner BOO,Would like to know if it is not to late to return as has never worked correctly! Keeps telling me not connected (never the twain will meet) when know it is!
1,Not a good read....,"I had to read Del-Del for school. Usually I enjoy reading books and do so often, but I found it hard to read Del-Del. I forced myself, but couldn't get past more then one chapter at a time due to the sheer boredom I felt when reading it. The book is repetative, long-winded and basically a waste of time... it doesn't resolve a lot in the end. I would find it hard to read it if you paid me the first time and would NEVER read it again. And it isn't only me who found it boring, not one person who I know who has read it has enjoyed it - my whole class, my sisters and my parents. I would advise you to find something more interesting to read."
3,Good common sense,The book contains fairly obvious common sense steps to take to loose weight. The pedometer that comes with it is not very good. I bought my husband Omron HJ-112 Digital Premium Pedometer which he loves.
2,"book is good, pedometer is not","The book seems fine, provides useful-enough info. The pedometer is junk. It came with no instructions at all. It has a button on the front, presumably for resetting the unit, but this did not work at all. I tried shaking the unit and it reset to 0, but after using it for a few days I concluded it was unreliable.Too bad the key element of the program (the pedometer) was such junk."
2,Little Information about reclaimed lumber,"This book is just a collection of plans, that the author made with reclaimed lumber. There are 4 pages dedicated to finding reclaimed lumber, 1 page of text and 3 pages of pictures. I was hoping to get more information about getting and cleaning up used lumber, rather than just a collection of projects."
4,Nostalgia for people over 30,"Miliki is a member of the spanish clown act Gaby, Fofo y Miliki, who was famous in Spain and Latin America from the 1940s to the 1970s. Miliki is the only surviving member of the group, and he has decided to cut a record with the act's old songs, featuring guest appearences from spanish stars like Miguel Bosse and Miguel Rios. Maybe kids of today will not conect with him, but if you knew the group as a child you are going to like this.(I'm 32, so I remember the group in his final stages)."
1,Pages missing and out of order,The book sucked. Pages were missing or out of order. I returned one and the replacement was the same way. I just gave up after that.
2,Mediocre,"First of all, when i purchased this boat on amazon it was only thirty bucks. I dont know why its listed at $99 here.I bought this boat to use in my new pool when i didnt want to go swimming. I dont use it anymore. Its not very fast and the turns are very wide. The battery life is okay. I guess for a toy boat under fifty dollars its not bad, but i definitely would not pay one hundred."
5,This review is about what is included in the video.,"Classic Scooby Doo @ his best. The first mystery ""That's Snow Ghost"" is about a snow monster at a lodge. The gang goes out with a big boom at the end. In ""Go Away Ghost Ship"" Scooby and the gang go to a ghost ship that is haunted by the Ghost of Redbeard. Can the gang wrap up the case before they become Ghost Pirate Stew?"
5,darkly thrilling,"This book will keep you awake at night with descriptions of weird ritualistic killings and their sometimes reluctant perpetrators. A scene in a muddy swimming pool is utterly unforgettable, as are the vivid and troubled characters."
2,layout person should include dimensions !!,"I've looked everywhere and have not found a conversion table for ""2-person"" to feet OR inches."
5,Great Product,"My Husband put them on his truck, they look awesome.They are very bright when you turn them on. They are a great product. Thank you"
5,Highly recommended,I have grown up in church and heard a lot of Bible teaching. Most of this looks up close at the details. Jensens Survey gives the big picture. This is really helpful to know when looking at the details or when a person is just starting their study of Gods Word.
2,Warning . . .,"Page 17 -- recipe for Double Chocolate Brownies. Part of the recipe is missing. When do you add the eggs, vanilla and sugar listed in the ingredients?I am surprised that someone didn't notice this since the first printing which appears to have been in 2002, but perhaps the error did not appear in those issues.I just bought this book and it makes me hesitant to try the recipes -- just wondering if there are other mistakes (this one was obvious).Note also -- there are only 117 pages in this book with 77 recipes listed (77 recipes if you include the recipe for the double chocolate brownies on page 17 which isn't complete). I think the suggested price of $25.00 is a little expensive for the content."
5,outstanding cd,"killer latin acid jazz. i remember them blowing ozo off the stage at the dragonfly and never being invited back. saw jeremy pivan at a couple shows (the buffalo club and the opium den), back in the days before entourage and miss seeing these guys live. i heard it through the grapevine that they might be getting back together. damn that would be grand. outstanding music, extraordinary musicianship...track #9 is the nuts!"
3,Convenient but difficult to tune.,"This radio's size makes it easy to carry and use. The tuning wheel is, however, quite small and I found it hard to tune in to a station and get the best reception. I also found that having the tuner on the top meant that I would move it inadvertantly as I moved. In the future, I think I will go with a digital set."
1,it just doesn't work,"You have to move the dial really really slowly to pick up any stations. Plus the connection with the headphones doesn't work so most of the time, if you can get a station, you can't hear it anyway. I'm just going to throw it out and keep the headphones as an extra set."
4,Charming,"I stumbled upon this book while the author was having a book signing in an area Christian book store. It was the highlight of my day.While theologians and critics might want to debate the simple straight forward answers given to difficult theological questions in this small book, I find it to be charming and useful. It is small enough to read in one sitting, yet profound enough to spread out over several sessions and use for meditation.This is an excellent present for non Christian friends. It is easy to read, contains much to think about, and is more complex than the simple folded tracts often given out.This is also an excellent tool for use in family devotions. I have a jr. high aged daughter. She is old enough to grasp these principles. Each of the 11 chapters is short enough to read and discuss during our nightly devotion times."
4,I had no idea,"I am not old enough to remember the tail end of Vietnam. Most of what I know came from history class or the movies. But this book allowed me to read about a part of the Vietnam war, I did not know existed. In fact, I believe a lot of people had no idea what was taking place in Cambodia and in Laos during this time period. Special forces, secret missions, thousands of North Vietnamese in ""de-militarized"" areas and only the Green Berets to keep them in check. Experience the first hand accounts of american special forces units as they are dropped deep behind enemy territory only to be hunted and attacked by forces who outnumber them significantly. Overall, the book is extemly interesting and a different kind of read. Real soldiers in real situtations, where any mistep means death."
4,Extinction: Evolution and the End of Man,"Extinction: Evolution and the End of Man, Is a well-written book by Michael Boulter. The Columbia University Press published it in 2002. This book takes you on an exciting journey through some of the Earth's most fascinating extinctions. Boulter spends the majority of the book showing similarities and differences between the Earth during these extinctions, as well as the present day. He asks the question; are humans sending our World down a deadly path that it will be unable to rebound from? I would recommend this book to anyone who is open to new ideas, and won't get depressed over the idea that we may be extremely close to our own extinction"
5,Josh Groban,"Truly a blessed and gifted young man. What a joy, listening to such a refreshing voice. The way this young artist gives such tenderness to his words with such a powerful voice, is quite impressive."
2,"Difficult to operate, seems poorly designed",This rail would be fine for an able bodied man or woman but I would not recommend it for an elderly person. It's just too difficult to operate and too heavy to lift.
3,Sanders Easy Adjust Bed Rail,The bed rail cannot be let down from the inside. The releasemechanism is below the level of the matress. If one can force access the rail bangs down and th release mechanism has to be readjusted. Opening from the outside is alrighty.
4,bed rail,the bed rail is good for what it was designed to do. the fold down feature is nice for allowning the person to get back into bed. needs a storage bag on it and it would be perfect.
3,Organizer covering can cause injury,My grandmother has had this bed cane on her bed for several years. The pocket organizer covering was put on so she would have a place to stash her Kleenex etc. She has injured the skin on her arm several times by way of the cane covering. Really old people have very frail skin and the covering can cause a friction injury. I had to take the cover off today for good after she bumped up against the covering and injured her skin again.
5,Standers Bedcane,My wife has Parkinsons and this product helps her to be able to get out of bed easier. She thinks it is very helpful to her
5,Sturdy and Easy to Install,Item showed up in one week. Easy to Install and Easy to use. Makes getting out of bed easy for handicapped individual.
4,Adjustable bed rails,"I bought one of these to use with a Select Comfort bed, with an adjustable frame. The secondary strap is not needed to keep it in place and while it doesn't shift around while in place, it is easy enough to remove for better access to the bed and patient. It worked so well, that I bought a second one for the other side of the bed.The only complaint is that it does require over a foot of clearance on the sides in order to drop it out of the way, then too, when dropped down it interferes wtih putting ones feet beneath the bed to access patient. But as stated above, it removes easily enough, although again, clearance is needed."
4,Easy to install-Easy to use,Works great and my 92 year old mother is safe and able to use the rail.Happy purchaser.Lind
1,Product not received,"We did not receive this product, although it says it was left at our house. Someone is home at all times, so I don't understand the claim. In any case, we did not receive it, and it is something that we need for a very ill person. Please tell me how this can be rectified."
4,Greatt product,"As an OT in the home care field I have seen many pieces of adaptive equipment. The Standers bed rail advantage is one of the best. Reasonably priced thru Amazon, Easy to assemble with no tools required and it is sturdy and stable during use. It provides people with leverage to get their legs in and out of bed,assist during rolling and supine to sit and for sit to stand. It also assists during transfers to the bed. I take the pocket off as it takes away from the handle surface. My patients are usually hesitant at first but are surprised and happy with the ease the bed rail provides them during bed mobility and transfers."
2,Wrong length,"I thought I was getting over the calf length but they are shorter. I don't think the description was very accurate. The quality is good but at that length they don't stay up as well. In addition, the charcoal socks were considerably lighter in color than charcoal."
5,Best socks ever.,"The socks are warm in the winter, but not hot in the summer. They don't sag down and wear extremely well."
4,Great Bollywood movie,We love the colors and music/dance of the Bollywood movies. This one did not dissapoint. Lots of dancing and music and a good story to go along with it.
5,Loved It!,This book is extraordinary! It changed my life by changing my focus. I started asking myself some of the Quantum Breakthrough questions on a regular basis and my life has not been the same. I am attracting opportunities and people in my life that are amazing. My life is growing in ways I never thought possible. I recommend this book to anyone who is ready to create the life the've always wanted and dreamed of.
5,Unbiased and Thorough Coverage of Therapies,"I was amazed at the vast amount of information in this book and the unbiased way in which it was presented. It covered all types of therapies whether nutritional, medical or alternative and did so indicating which ones were backed up by studies and whether the studies were done in a scientific manner or not. It was very, very helpful."
2,What was this guy thinking when he wrote this book?,"As a wrestling fan and a fan of Kane, I was disappointed by Chiappetta's biography. He should have called his book The Overdramatized History of Kane. The first part, which chronicles Kane's childhood and high school years, reads like a Lifetime movie, completely overdramatic. The second part was laughable because Chiappetta's portrait of the ""real"" Kane, (the man outside the ring) was so unreal. This book, I presume, was supposed to shows us the inner depths of this WWE superstar's mind and learn why he is the way he is, but all this book shows is that the author doesnt really know anything about his subject."
5,KC Slimlites are high quality construction,I bought a cheaper set of Pilot driving lights for my Jeep Wrangler and was disappointed. I finally decided to pay more and get the KC Slimlites and the construction and quality was evident. I can recommend these with confidence.
5,NIce lights,"I bought these for a 2008 Jeep Wrangler. I mounted them on the side of the windshield with the optional brackets. They look great! One word of caution about wiring, they say they are easy to install, but I had to have them professionally wired and it took them 2.5 hours and $150.00."
3,undecided,"Not a bad product, more storage space than I thought with the lift up cup holder, unfortunately, the piece doesn't sit and secure as well as it should, and I've seen mine tip or slid off more than once, no spills yet, but I guess that's just a matter of time. I don't know if mine is defective or if it's the design. Looks great though, nice compact piece.Can't say I'd recommend it though."
4,Small Protector,"Withe the success of the Game Boy from Nintendo, there have been numerous versions that have delivered. Their latest version, the Game Boy Micro, which only plays GBA games, has really surprised so many gamers. But, it is just sometimes too difficult to forget how to protect the game system. The micro sleeve is a small but convient way of protecting your Game Boy Advance Micro. It is very sleek, stylish and clever way to carry the smallest Game Boy system ever. I love the way it feels on the outside, and it works very nicely on the inside. If you do own the Game Boy Advance Micro, you definitely should be able to get this.Price: BConvience: B 1/2+Overall: B"
4,It made a great Christmas present!,"Both my daughters appreciated this ""man tailored"" watch as a Christmas present this year. More women are wearing men's watches than ever before. Both daughters are working in the corporate world and said that they would definitely wear this watch at work. If I'm not mistaken I think I found this watch under women's jewelry. However, links had to be taken off both watches in order for them to fit a woman's wrist. The price was right and it's an attractive watch."
1,From a non-Catholic FL reader,"I think Mary Gordon could benefit from a few sessions with a psychiatrist. Such obsession about her father who left her too soon! Her relationship with her mother could use some help, too."
2,An Electra Complex Unrestrained,"Much as this reader enjoyed Mary Gordon's other writing, especially Final Payments, he must fault the writer for this maundering, meandering piece of work. Bloviated with rhetorical questions, she plows the same ground over and over again, bemoaning her fate, and crying out, ""Why? Why?"" One is tempted to respond, ""Because. Because."" Without the self-conscious and self-serving rhetorical questions, this book would be 1/3 shorter, and it would be improved. If you've ever fantasized about being a psychiatrist, wondering what it would be like to listen at length to someone who refuses to accept life, this book should satisfy you. For the rest of us, let's hope that Gordon finally accepts herself. Frankly, Kathryne Harrison's The Kiss was more fully honest and better written."
3,my bras,The bras I ordered turned out not to be the bra I was looking for. I wished there was a way to hone a choice so that mistakes like this do not happen. I don't like to have to pay to return items that are wrong due to the lack of relevant information.
1,THE BLAND LEADING THE BLAND,"This is the first time I have ever gone to the trouble to review any product online. After purchasing this cookbook based on numerous positive reviews, I got it for me and my daughter. This is the ""bland leading the bland."" I made a half-dozen of the best-sounding dishes, and nothing had much flavor. Even after doubling the spices (or even raiding my cabinet to see what I could add before it hit the plate) nothing stands out as a recipe I enjoy enough to ever make again, let alone serve to friends. The best thing about this cookbook is that the small portions give you less to have to throw down the drain."
4,easy recipes,The recipes are easy to follow. Everything is broken down for you.I am on a low fat diet and I find these recipes easy and very goodtasting.
5,Easy food for healthy living...,"We love `Healthy Cooking For Two (or just you)'. This is no nonsense, straightforward cookbook aimed at today's busy, hard working couples. This is a book written by a nutritionist who happens to be an award-winning restaurant owner as well. You won't find fancy photographs in this book; instead you'll find plenty of tips on cooking and easy to follow recipes that taste great."
3,An OK cookbook,"This was OK but not as good, in my opinion, as ""Going Solo in the Kitchen"". However, it does include recipes for two which is a really good idea.Sue from Ohio"
5,"Very truthfull of life, peaceful, inspirational, excellent","This album my husband & I have loved since the 70's. Never before have I enjoyed an album from start to finish as much. A true classic example of what life has to offer, & how to enjoy it. Al Green shares the same passion in my opinion, another artist we enjoy. This album touches on so many things, gangs, family, God, appreciating what we have, even inspiring us to keep going. I have introduced this artist with this album to friends, & they all seem to agree, if they at all know how to ""Be thankful for what ""they"" got"" Too bad he doesn't record any longer. Our thanks to William for sharing this collection,that we have enjoyed."
3,Sort of decent,"I bought this thing about a month ago and it has held up pretty well...until today. I tried to move the arm with the trigger finger that holds the pulse rifle a little and the arm broke off along with the plastic peg that holds it on. I had to glue it back on and now it looks pretty stupid, so...that's lame. But other than that, it looks pretty good. I'd give it a 3/5 because it's not very durable."
1,No pictures of any of the artwork - it is all B&W,"I am returning this book. It is all in black and white. Additionally, there are not many pictures of the completed artwork or any of the steps. Most of the pages have handprints in the margins or the bottom even if the artwork is about other topics such as sand painting. The remaining pages have small illustrations of children making the art. While some of the activities are interesting, the book is not visually appealing at all, which is strange for an art book."
5,EXCELLENT QUALITY/PRICE,"I bought this to replace my hubby's old worn one (repairedseveral times by shoe repair man). The original one I boughtat a gift shop was $20+ and these are better quality with greatlarge magnets.Decided they would be great for son, son-in-law, and older grandsons & usethem for giving money and/or gift card. I'm putting mine intiny mini-stockings before wrapping. Also great for stocking stuffers.The dark brown is very dark. Prefer black as it is handled so often."
5,Awsome Yasmin,"Hey, maybe MGA made the Bratz singers again because the Space Angelz one wasn't the best, I loved them, but the Rock angelz one does look a little better. I love them. The Bratz Rock Angelz is the best collection MGA thought of. And their TV show was totally the best. My Scene dolls just wish they looked like Bratz dolls. But they are too ugly to look like them."
3,"silky tunes, lyrics questionable","I have quite a collection of songs in portuguese. Although this is Brazil remixed, the songs just don't quite make it. There are some cool songs, like samba numeiro 9 or felicidade, but number one has a great beat, but ""one is a lonely number"". It's a bit odd to listen to, kinda embarrassing.Anyway, the tunes are silky, and soothing, but other cds are more effective. Maybe try Cateano Veloso for something real and Bossa Nova from Putumayo."
2,"Great book for widowed women, not for divorcees","This book is good for widowed women over 55, but just didn't help deal with the greatest challenges facing a divorced woman who has been in the work force her entire live, is able to make decisions and choices on her own and faces a different set of challenges than someone who is widowed (surgeon's wife) with financial security and a supportive extended family."
3,Girls with the Grandmothers Faces,"Though this book was said to be new, it was old as the pages were yellowed. Otherwise, it was in good condition and came quickly."
1,A whole lot of trouble...,"The lock worked very well in the beginning. But after owning it about six months, the lock jammed and the keys broke in the process of attempting to un-jam. Had to cut the wire with cable cutters, and now will have to re-order keys to get the lock out of my laptop. Until then, my laptop has a lock with a cut wire sticking out of it and there's nothing more I can do about it.For only lasting six months, it was not worth the money. Even less so for all the trouble it has caused."
2,limited use,This gadget is of limited use. A good old tri square is quicker and fills the hand better. The one advantage of this one is the size that allows one to put it in one's pocket.
2,Beware the Flaws,"Initially, these Night Surf plates seemed functional (we've had them a couple of years now), but as time went by, more scratches and chips than we bargained for.One salad plate simply burst apart, after removing from the microwave. That was a little scary, so we don't use them in the microwave any longer."
2,Not an auspicious start,"Back when I was in high school, I bought all of Styx's early (pre-stardom) albums because I was a huge fan with too much money on my hands. By and large, even a fan big will have a hard time digesting the overblown pretentious dated art rock featured on the band's debut album. That said, there are a few interesting moments such as portions of their bombastic rendering of Aaron Copeland's classical piece ""Fanfare for the Common Man,"" and the semi-good rocker ""I'm Gonna Make You Feel It."" Otherwise, take it from a fan and move on instead to later periods in the Styx discography."
4,Best bag ever!,"I love the McKlein laptop bag. I shopped around quite a bit in search of the best possible deal, and Amazon had the cheapest price for this bag. I heard horror stories in receiving shipment from Amazon, and I must say my item was packaged very well, and delivered much sooner than I expected. The only issue I have with this item was that it wasn't available in all the other colors. I actually wanted pink, but the aqua was the only color available at the low price I received. Other than that, this is a great stylish looking bag for the working woman. I've received tons of compliments, and two of my co-workers have gone out and purchased the same bag."
3,I was disappointed,"I have been using a 15"" dell flat screen monitor at my home. I needed a new monitor for my office, and decided to upgrade my home monitor with this 17"" Samsung, and take the Dell to work.The resolution on the Samsung was disappointing. Simple type was slightly muddy. I played with the various controls, finally came to the conclusion that the product is inferior to the inexpensive Dell monitor I already had. When I unplugged the Samsung, and replaced it with the Dell, I was relieved! Much easier on the eyes.I took the Samsung to my office, and placed it at a workstation that doesn't get much use :-(Next time I purchase a monitor, I'm going to go to an actual store (!) (something I don't do much anymore) and look at the screen before I make my purchase.My advise is the same to you. Make sure that you are happy with what you see. You're probably going to spend a lot of hours staring at this thing."
3,He loved it,"My puppy buddy loved this toy, but it was easily eaten and quickly ended up in the puppy toy grave yard. It was his favorite and sadly, its dead! Lasted about a month."
1,Didn't last a full day,"My dog, a one year old border collie mix, is pretty rough on toys. I expected this toy to last about a month, based on others' reviews and the fact that he has another toy from this company which is on its sixth month. This toy was in the beginning stages of destruction within minutes, and was completely demolished in a few short hours. For almost $11, I expected more."
4,Excellent Album overall,This is an excellent traditional Christmas album in the mold of John Rutter style. I would have given it five stars but some of the recordings (sound wise) were a little low. That is not a reflection of the actual music but the recording.
1,Swing and a miss...,"What a great premise unfortunately squandered by trying (and failing) to turn the story of Superman into a comedy. The boy that would become Superman crash lands in Great Britain rather than America and grows up to be a bumbling idiot even when he's trying to help the country. It's as if he acted like Clark Kent even after the glasses were off. On top of that, the press has turned on him, and it seems like everyone doesn't like him. This is the source of most of the book's gags, and they're really not funny; they're just sad (a running joke has his parents trying to abandon him because they don't think he should be using his powers).Basically, if you like Superman, then you should definitely avoid this book. It's not even worth wasting the short time it takes to read it."
1,Incredibly Disappointing,"Wow, I cannot believe how boring I found this book. While I did enjoy the artwork, the writing is just dull, flat, lifeless. I expected soooo much more from the man who wrote Faulty Towers. Not for Superman fans, not for Cleese fans, not for anyone, really."
1,Screamin' Memes - Sie!,"If ya dont have any real content, just put a bunch of screamin' mimis together and let um scream. No wonder the American public is nuts."
1,Many parts inaccurate,"I really didn't like the book & found many inaccuracies. The authors admit to being opposed to using rabbits as meat so I can't see how they could have done an objective investigation on raising rabbits for meat. I've talked to some who breed commercially and was told some of that information is incorrect. I picked up several other inaccuracies as well. For example it said meat breeders wean at 4 weeks then the authors say it's too early, it's suppose to be 8 weeks. They really missed the mark, it's 8 weeks for pet rabbits but rabbits can be safely weaned at 4 weeks and some of the commercial breeds are selected so young can be weaned at 4 weeks. Alot fo stuff like that which will give people not involved in breeding a very distorted view of the commercial industries. Some conclusions about rabbit behavior seemed to contradict the authors observations as well. This book seemed more like some sort of animal rights propaganda."
4,So Far So Good!,Currently I am in the process of reading this book. But it was in the condition as it was promised.
3,Small,Very small. Didn't realize they were so small. They were not what I was looking for but they'll work out fine next year at Christmas.
5,"Ottone, re di Germania: Roles to identify yourself (with the great JAMES BOWMAN)","The opera Ottone, re di Germania (1723) by Georg Friedrich Haendel (1685-1759) is one of the most romantic operas that I have listened. I bought this CD set because of the performance of the great countertenor JAMES BOWMAN, who sang with a wonderful peace and beauty all of his arias. His aria ""Dall'onde ai fieri moti"" is sung with many energy and beauty by JAMES BOWMAN, but he best aria of this CD set is in my opinion his aria ""Dopo l'orrore d'un ciel turbato"", friendly and full of hope. The countertenor Dominique Visse as Adelberto sang marvelously, too. All of the roles represent their passions with many power, specially the role of Adelberto.I definitely recommend this CD set."
5,Hipness at Christmas!,These jazz big band arrangements of Christmas carols are both lyrical and swinging and use the hippest jazz harmonizations. Straight ahead jazz soloing too. No schmaltz here. Love it!
1,So disappointing!,"This CD plays as though the producer couldn't decide whether it should be hip-hop, rap or the fantastic blues from the movie. Having sound bites from film's dialogue injected into the music cuts and then repeated ad nauseam is more befitting to gangsta music and had absolutely no place in this album. What was the producer thinking? The music in the movie was so great, why couldn't s/he just leave it alone? This was not creativity, it was vandalism!"
3,smaller than expected,"My son saved up his money for this pricey construction vehicle. Perhaps we were not aware of scaling, but when he received it, the vehicle was considerably smaller than he expected. It appears well made, but not what he had anticipated."
4,Under cover of daylight,"Well written, well plotting and I like his descriptions of the Florida landscape.Herman Labruyère."
1,WHAT THRILLER? Ain't no thriller here. Dead boring here.,"I have tried 3 James W. Hall books, Buzz Cut, Under Cover of Daylight, Body Language. None of them held my interest. There was nothing in the stories or the characters to get a grip and hold on too. Nothing! Conversations are sluggish, strained, monotone, as are all the characters. Minuscule action/reaction. Florida?, wouldn't know it by his books. I do not recommend this book_Under Cover of Daylight_or any of James W. Hall's books.I recommend Dennis Lehane's _Prayers for Rain_ or _Gone Baby Gone_ if you want to read a REAL thriller"
2,annieb,The Old Dutch Purity Teapot in red does not look at all like the picture. It is a very bright red pot with no design at all on it. I am very disappointed in what I received. Was I shipped the wrong pot??????
5,Hope that they could make a second album!,"This CD is the best! I bought this CD 3 years ago when it came out, and I can't stop listening to it! They were my favourite group, and I really hope that the rumours about them coming back are true. They are so much better than the other group B2K. They play their own instruments and they're really good when they perform. Anyway, this album is great! The best songs has to be ""Youre the bomb"", ""Flava"", and ""No Doubt"". ""I don't Wanna Play Basketball"" is also good. All the songs are good and if you buy this, you won't regret it!"
5,The best there is in the market..,"I shopped quite a bit for an 50inch plasma, and found this one way above the competetion.I would highly recommend buying this set."
5,Jehro has touched me with his magic,"I first heard Jehro on a cd which was given to me called the Marathonians, when i first heard the song which is called ""Life is free"", i kept on replaying the song over and over, it was as if the song was made for me. I initially thought of Jehro as a black man, and was surprised to find out he was not, i have been a lover of Reggae music all my life and this guy has a voice that belongs in the reggae category,his voice is sweet and the songs are meaningful, i hope he brings us many more to enjoy."
2,umm Jason Priestley was good in it!,"This movie has alot of action in it and a good story, kinda easy to follow, but it was just missing talent from other actors. See this if you're a big Jason fan, otherwise, skip it."
4,Fascinating,I love anything Hitchcock. Totally enjoyed all the inside dope of making Psycho. Lots of interesting facts about a movie that was made with lack of money and time. Quite interesting. A must read if you're interested in the creation of a classic movie.
1,The wrong path,"If you want to play games of complete chance, there are any number of books available through Amazon or elsewhere that can explain how these games work and how one plays them. Ellison does some of this, but then spends much of his book talking about how to ""spot patterns"" and how such nonsense can be used to ""beat the house"" at games like roulette and craps.Nonsense.Spend your money wisely, and buy a book that shoots straight. Ellison's ""wise guy"" tips will only make one person wealthier-- Ellison."
1,Case Closed(detective conan) is a piece of sh**,Case Closed(detective conan) is a piece of sh** is one the most boring show to the date
5,"Beat in it's purest, in a word perfect kerouac","Kerouac was a master with words and the rythm of the human voice, his words beatifully crafted are written in a way that you have to read it allowed, a book you'll want with you every where if you appreciate anything about poetry"
4,I enjoyed reading it,"It was the first book I ever read about parapsychology and I read it through and learned many things that I never would have bothered reading about had it not been written so comprehensively. I enjoyed the references to the relativity theory in relation to psi phenomena, the history of parapsychology,the names of prominent people in parapsychology,the different experimental methods used through the history of parapsychology,and that the book was so contemporary. The thing I disagreed with about the book is the fact that it talked of telepathic experiances as ocurring as non-continuous, as in, being isolated experiances, whereas I know that tele-pathic experiances can occur moment-by-moment,day-by-day, week-by-week,month-by-month,i.e. continuously. Thank-you"
2,Should be retired,"This book should be retired. First published in 2005, the book is now almost 4 years old.The chapters on webmin, a web-based Linux management tool, were a bit absurd. As if any enterprise would use webmin to manage their enterprise servers.Book is missing some key concepts regarding Active Directory and integration with Kerberos realms.Am very disappointed with the book."
1,Disappointed customer,"Ordered a 6.5 from this company on Amazon and the company never shipped them out and then when I finally contacted them they stated that I ordered a toddler boot and that they do not have them in stock. So I contacted Amazon and they assured me of what I ordered a big kid 6.5 timberland boot. My ordered was suppose to be shipped out on 12/23 and they never contacted me about the shoes not being in stock. After they cancelled my order, I went back on Amazon to see if they still have the shoes listed and to my surprise they still do."
3,Twangin' Good Time,"The Hollisters offer up a combination of honest-to-goodness honky tonk and Texas-style hillbilly rock. The Derailers may be better known in alt.country, but whereas the Derailers sound a bit arch, the Hollisters sound energetic and genuine. You`ll get the idea with the first track ""Fishin' Man,"" full of personality and twang. ""Thrill of the Ride"" has a Waylon Jennings beat and jangle combined with a vocal that echoes Johnny Cash. The driving twang runs the gamut from Cash to Buddy Holly. If your tastes fall anywhere inbetween, Sweet Inspiration is a very enjoyable record."
4,"It's a concept album, but it works","Be warned-- this is a weird album that can only come from the disturbed mind of someone like James Blood Ulmer. It is, as the title suggests, just Blood's guitar with a string quartet to back him, although the quartet plays more than just a rhythm section role in the music. On Odyssey (possibly Blood's best-- I actually prefer it to Tales of Captain Black, so pick it up if you can find it), Ulmer proved that a guitar and a violin can not only peacefully coexist, but work oddly well together. This album is far different from Odyssey, though, in that there is no distortion of the sound of the string quartet. It actually sounds in several places like a classical album, but every time it begins to do so, Blood's guitar comes in like in an old call-and-response blues piece, echoing what the quartet has played, but in harmolodics. It is weird, but strangely, it works."
4,Mixed Danish,"This is a somewhat mixed bag of Danish compositions that vary in their accessibility. The works by Gade and Horneman would be familiar as to style, even though the works themselves may not be. On the other hand, the works by Abrahamsen and Norgard require some effort when listening to them. However, they are not as off-putting as might be the case with other contemporary composers."
1,This is definitely not an Ally McBeal connection.,"I had become a big fan of the music Vonda sang on Ally McBeal and thought this might would be similar in style. Wrong--big time. This is a painful album to listen to after giving it two chances. There is too much whining, bad guitar playing and no beat. If this is the true Vonda, I will have to pass. Luckily the record store took the CD back and the clerk agreed it was worse than disappointing."
3,vonda shepard,"I like this artist on the McBeal disc much better.She is ok,but it is not the same as the other disc."
3,So so,Just not up to the allies mcbeal series. I like vonda shepard but just this dragged on and on. By 7:30 was just not up to par. By 7:30 was just the same old stuff.
2,"Vonda has a very noticable, unforgettable voice.....","However, this CD, collaboration of songs was the worst I have heard in a long time. #8 on the CD is the only song I enjoy personally speaking. I love the Ally McBeal songs, but this music on here, I was totally disappointed with...... TBSmith"
3,Average suspense movie,It's a low budget suspense movie but not bad. There is some tension building wondering how it's going to end. Somewhat predictable ending but still interesting enough to watch once.
4,Intense !!!!,"This movie gives that ""What Lies Beneath"" feel where a married man has an affair that later triggers a bizzare chain of events , but its not a ghost terrizing this time . Very Intense !!! Very Disturbing !!!!!"
4,A Lovely Album for Wiggles Fans,"I wouldn't recommend this as a lullaby album (too much chatting between songs), except for avid, rabid Wiggles fans like my son. It's a vast improvement over others such as 'Hoop-de-doo! It's a Wiggly Party' for nap and bed times."
2,Cheap product,"This product is good for displaying. Spring fell of upon attaching the first wine bottle. Took it a part and fixed it. I work now, but we don't know how long it would last. Not recommended"
3,"Good, but had leaking problems.","We still own this product, but at first we had leaking problems. You really have to screw the bottles in good and make sure all the seals are closed. I do like how they measure out shots for you, but it can get messy if you don't check all the seals and closures. It's a good product, and it's lasted a while. I don't really use it all that much, but it is nice when you have liquor that you do regularly go to. And it's easy to mix drinks."
2,"Works, but not well built","Received my product recently and was disappointed to find that the top half didn't fit well into the bottom half at all. I had to spend about 30 minutes just to bend the metal to get the two pieces to fit. After putting some bottles on, the top fell off. Decided to super glue it together and that seems to have fixed it. The materials used could also be more durable (not plastic)."
3,"Cheaply made, still decent for the price",One of the 4 spouts I cannot even use due to leaking issues. There is another that seems to drip once and a while whenever I am not looking to know which one it is. I am planning on taking them all apart and seeing if I can simply change out a seal or an o-ring or something to give them a more better fix. Based on the price and speed of shipping I am not really disappointed just wish I didn't have to go back and fix it while it's still somewhat new.
1,A slow decline downwards...,"This series becomes so awful that it is laughable. The characters soon become flat and bland. Elk practically beings to whines every episode and has to learn to ""accept"" things. This quickly leads to every episode having poor animation.The fights stop around the middle of the series. I am not joking. Tosh gets to chop up maybe 3 guys at most. The problem doesn't only lie in the animation and characters, but the story becomes down-right stupid. By the end you won't care as the creators lost interest. Clive is a horrible badguy. The last few episodes are the worst. Everyone shakes because of everything. Everyone is shocked because of everything. In DBZ, Krillin shakes when someone throws a punch. This series is worse than that.If you want a great series try ""Samurai Deeper Kyo"". It is so much better. The creators actually make it better as they go along. This series quickly falls apart. Save your money..."
1,HD fail when it arrivated,"This looks good, but not works well. Just received the laptop. And turn on the power, after finished the register for xp system, the hard drive fail. Now the system can't restart, and the big noise from hard disk.There is no recover CD. The adapter is huge and heavy. Can't belive that Sony make such huge adapter for small laptop. Very stupid.Hardware fail, hope amazon help me to return it.Who packed the package? The laptop is on the bottom, and the air bags are all on the top. There is no protection for the laptop at all. I think amazon need to learn how to pack.Call amazon customer serivces, they don't serve you. They keep asking you to call back later. Call them second time 3 hours later, they still said call back couple hours later. The call is from indian, can't hear clear and long time delay.I think it should give negative 5 stars."
3,Too advanced for most amateur mandolin players,"Well, I thought that this book + DVD was a tutorial, but it is just a compilation of songs with attached music notation and tablature instead. No lessons.Too advanced for me, but the title of the book is misleading."
5,long looked for DVD.,I'd been looking for this film for 2 years for my son and I was glad to find one that could be viewed in France ! I had it sent to his home address and my daughter-in-law confirmed that it could be viewed. It will be a Chrismas present.
1,not good,"I'm surprised that i paid $70 for this book and the pages from Chapters 3-4 are out of order. Amazon.com was very quick to send me another book, yet it had the same problem. They offered me a discount of 25% off to keep the book--which i did, because I need the book for a class that i'm taking right now. Some (not all) of the people in my class have the same problem. Anyway, I had to copy the pages in the correct order and it's a big pain. It would have been nice for amazon.com to contact the appropriate company to get me a book with all the pages in order."
5,Triumph of the Trouveres. Buy It!,"'Songs of the Trouveres' in the 'The Spirits of England and France' series by the Gothic Voices, directed by Christopher Page is one of the better 'early music' recordings I have bought and heard.The Trouveres were wandering performers in France who wrote and performed 'grand chant' songs in the vernacular. In contrast to liturgical and other devotional music, this was the 'soap opera' entertainment of the day, as this genre was all about 'a protracted meditation on the fortunes of loving'.This group features one of the very few 'stars' of early music performances, the soprano Emma Kirkby who only appears on two tracks, accompanied by either percussion or medieval lute.This recording does justice to this series, Gothic Voices, and Hyperion."
3,Mellow and Pleasant,"Abdullah Ibrahim at the piano softly plays some sweet music on this CD. Although it is not as upbeat as many of his works, it is definitely a worthwhile piece. Should have 3 and 3/4 stars."
2,Techno-heads only need apply,"I bought this book with the hopes of providing my users with a good introductory text for doing their own queries on our main server system. Unfortunately, this book is written by technologists in technologists' terms -- o.k. if you're a budding programmer type; not so good for the accounting clerk."
4,"Pleasing, pleasant familiar classic piano","This collection of piano solos is the kind of playing that I would like to hear at a fine restaurant or at a late-night piano lounge. Relatively quiet, not overpowering, not over-embellished piano solos of some old-time favorites. The piano (Bosendorfer) is well tuned, and the playing is crisp (not sloppy). There is relatively little in the way of jazzy improvisation, and even less of the flamboyant cocktail piano styles of Liberace or Carmen (???). I personally find the flamboyant styles to be unpleasant and intruding on the melody, harmony, and even rhythm. On the other hand, I would like to see a little bit more in the way of altered chords and improvisations. That is, the playing borders on being too straight or plain (for my tastes). Frankly, I have not found ANY piano solos that I think are spot on; this is definitely one of the better ones."
4,Mosby's Nursing Drug Reference,"Very helpful reference for nurses who administer medication as well as others who need a quick reference to understanding medications. Much smaller and handier to use than a PDR. Great resource for Home Health nurses to keep in the car. Has the action, uses, dosage/routes, side effects, contraindications, precautions, pharmacokinetics and nursing considerations in a clear and consise format. Medications are listed alphabetically but also have the generic name, pronunciation, functional class and chemical class listed beneath. Colored pictures are found in the center of the book as a visual reference to some of the pills. These are just some of the features, but there are many more. I make sure that I order a new one each year!"
5,love this music...,yes i'm old/47 ...i remember hearing this when i was 5yr young...fabulous timeless songs... can sing all from memory...used to listen to KISS at age 11...i guess real music calms the savage beast and can make him smile
1,It's not what I remember,You can't go home again. This didn't satisfy my wish for good choral singing of the oldies.I don't know if they picked poor selections or not.Just didn't satisfy.
4,"Helps with Sinus Congestions, but Stings","It helps with sinus congestion, but stings a little more than I was expecting. It is definately gentler than Sinus Buster, but still stings more than the label implies. I might just be over sensative."
5,The most delightful diet plan ever,"This must be the most delightful and refreshing diet book ever written. Beautifully narrated, full of ideas and a pleasure to read."
3,This was just an average read for me,"I didn't think there was anything new in terms of eating habits, due to her previous book. Unlike her first book, I felt that this was catered more specifically to women, just by the topics she talked about. However, I did enjoy the section on wine. Having been in the wine business for so many years, she certainly knew what she was talking about. This was just an average read for me and I think that potential readers are better off getting the book from the library. Or, getting her first book."
5,The author to read if you want authentic French ideas,"I started with French Women Don't Get Fat and loved this book. It was not a ""diet"" book but a mind modification as to how to eat a smaller amount and be just as satisfied as if you had an enormous plate full of food. I ordered French Women for All Seasons, and am enjoying it as well. Although given the two choices, I'd go with the first book. Mireillle Guilliano is an engaging author with many anecdotes about her life growing up in France and living in New York. Her recipes are simple and delicious. Yes, some of the ingredients are not easy to find in the Midwest, but most are. She stresses eating the fruits and vegetables in season at that time, and finding quality fruits and vegetables at local markets instead of supermarkets.I've read one book by Anne Garonne and found it less than informative. If you want authenticity, read M. Guiliano's books. I also ordered her cookbook, but haven't gotten to it yet."
2,No comparison to her first book!,Started to read the book and just couldn't get into it like the first book. Not what I thought it would be!
4,Power Twang From The Icy Regions of Northern Europe,"With the steady success of Americana Roots Rock music and its effect on American culture, it is inevitable that we hear the echoes of that music back to us from Europe. Sometimes the reflection is so authentic, it can even be a better representation of domestic faire. Such is the case with the Norwegian band, The Scarecrows.This five-piece band prowls the border between rock & roll and classic country rock with an authoratative badge and justified pride. They successfully pull off a ""Western Desert"" sound from the icy regions of Northern Europe.With three guitarists (in studio they are even joined by steel guitarist Kjell Karlsen) The Scarecrows sometimes have a guitar attack compareable to the southern bands like Lynyrd Skynyrd and Outlaws."
2,SMALL!!!,I was disappointed in this item due to the size. Think kid size. It was a gift and I was very embarrassed to give it.
1,my review,"i do not think this is a good movie for kids. the teacher of my child played this in the classroom and my child said ""she was afraid to watch it and it was scary"""
2,Cute but WAY smaller than expected!,"I bought this for my Boxers, thinking it would be about the size of a softball or a canteloupe. It is actually about tennis ball sized. Might be great for a tiny litle ankle chomper, but not big dogs."
1,will not last,"I bought this toy for my nine pound morkie (maltese yorkie) and it did not last one day. He loves it, but within the first day two of the loops are torn apart, leaving the filling exposed. If your dog eats the filling, they will likely vomit soonafter. Do not waste your money on this item."
2,"Should have been titled ""Working Out at the Gym""","For some reason I thought this was more of a beginners book. All of the photos are of incredibly muscle-bound men and women working out in a fully-equipped gym! They use equipment that I certainly don't have in my home. I'm sure it is a good book for someone who's really into weight lifting, has lots of time to devote to it AND has access to a gym."
5,Awesome CD!!!!!,"I have 4 words to say-""Get John Legend's CD!!!!!!! It is awesome, from track #1 to #14. You will not regret it. GO John!!! You have a masterpiece. -Nuff Props to You.........."
5,WOW!,"well, this album is amazing, for a very long time I haven't enjoied from an RnB album, like I enjoy this one...first and formost, john legend's voice is amazing, not powerfull like other RnB singers, but very unique.all the songs on the album makes you feel like you listen to soul/RnB from the 60's-70's mixed up with the RnB sound of today...I believe that if you wanna try somthing new in the RnB, and even if you don't like kanye west productions (kanye produced some of the songs on the cd), you will like this cd, because it's diffrent and excellent..."
1,average,"The man whines too damn much. His songs sound broken down...like they need to speed them up a little. I cant complain though, I brought it for 2 dollars boot leg!"
3,LEGEND? NOT QUITE YET...,"Not a bad debut for the self-procalimed legend. I like his vibe though. Maybe from a 2nd installment I can see where this cat may be headed. ""Ordinary People"" is the staple in this whole thang while ""Used To Love You"" is the groove thang. I also liked ""Live It Up"", a very nice 70s-ish feel to it, almost sounds as if it could be a sitcom theme (And that's not a slight). A keeper though."
5,R&B Worth Remembering,"""Get Lifted"" is one of the best R&B albums by a male singer in years. John's almost in a league by himself. No other male R&B artist is drafting songs like: LET'S GET LIFTED, I CAN CHANGE, STAY WITH YOU, or LIVE IT UP. He's creating songs that will still be good 10-20 years from now. It's difficult to create an album that's both artistic and commercially viable. But John succeeded. Some people fly on the commercial end, but the artistic merits are minimal. ""Get Lifted"" represents the best of both. John Legend is the rare singer that comes around every so many years. He's worth remembering. Those interested in having a serious R&B recording career should take a good listen to this album. Aspire to this level. I would definitely recommend this CD."
5,This is just TOO GOOD,"Dang, dang, dang!!!!Talk about a good CD. I am loving this to the point of forgetting what my darn name be, yall.Git YALLS a copy right away, cuz this cut is the BADDDEST mack in a long OLDIE-inspired time.Getdown/GetdownGET IT!"
2,Kinda Disappointing,"I expected more because of all the hype surrounding the CD. OK, the last seven songs are decent, with Ordinary People being exceptional, but that's about it. Vocally, John Legend is kinda weak. Definitely not the best voice I've heard. The first seven songs are pretty shallow and superficial - like much of what's out there in the R & B music world today with very little exception. Maybe he included them to appeal to a broader audience. Too bad. If you like spending your hard-earned money to listen to only half a CD, then buy it. Otherwise, don't waste your time or money on this one."
1,-Negative $ start.....just a zero,"This is Crap! I bought it because everyone was talking about him. I tired to listen to this CD for one week,and had to give it away. The person i gave it to, passed it on to someone else, and they passed it on......No one i know liked this CD. maybe his next CD will be better. I just do like this CD. it's boring, and his singin gets to me in a bad way. So bad it makes me do the #2....what a waste of money never again, will i buy a cd because who produced it."
1,Because,I'm just going to give this cd 1 star because one guy is posting reviews with different names giving the cd 5 stars.You shouldn't do that.I never heard this cd
5,"Saw him twice, met him ,and dying for more!!","Words cannot describe how I feel when I listen to John Legend. I feel like I know him. I have had the great fortune to see him twice in concert, once in L.A. and once in Seattle both concerts within a span of 6 days. I would have paid thousands, stood in line for months and given up sleep for years just to experience what I did. He speaks to my soul. Literally. He is an absolute gem. Meeting him was just the icing on the huge delicious cake that he provided me during his performance. He is humble, appreciative, and probably not yet aware of what he does to his audience. I can say with great confidence that he will be a tremendous success, because I, along with hundreds of thousands of others will guarantee it! My Gifts to all I know this Christmas season...The ""Get Lifted"" cd. Without a doubt, everyone should feel this good. I look forward to meeting him and talking with him again! Now go buy the cd!!"
5,Great Soul/RnB/Hiphop CD,"This cd is great. Great lyrics, smooth voice, nice beats. John Legend started this year off right with this powerful cd. Get Lifted is right up there with recent Releases from Joss Stone and Jill Scott.My Favorites so far are lets get lifted, Ordinary people and She don't have to know."
5,Great Info,I am trying to collect a good representation of the average soldier in Vietnam. This book has help greatly in see the uniform and equipment used. There are lots of picture and great descriptions. The book is well organized and very useful in my search.
3,Yamaha RD Repair Manual,"The book title lends the belief that it mainly contains info on Yamaha's RD series of bikes. The first two-thirds of the book covers the pre-RD street bikes. Worry not, the older bikes are basically the same. Where the RD's are different the latter third of the book has you covered. Some of the language is a bit odd since it was written in British English. There is a chart that translates British to American."
5,Only cookbook that I use the recipes without alteration!,Have used this one for years. Concise and no nonsense approach combined with fanatasic recipes is a sure winner. The first few chapters are a great source of info for even the experienced bakers. If I could only have one book on cakes this is it.
2,Unclear spoon feeding,"Way overpriced and tooooo overrated; although, maybe not for my taste, but... ........This is like an excellent reference book for engineers -- a collection of recipes to use without thinking. Now thinking is indeed important and this book is very far from stimulating thinking. However, the problems do contain ""proofs"" (the quotes must be used) -- probably, as an attempt to make up for lack of precision. It seems like a good book to use in high school, but definitely not for college. I really am being very generous with the 2 stars. Let's see, what else.............There really isn't anything very good to say I'm afraid...."
5,OUTSTANDING DEBUT CD,This is a wonderful debut cd for Chris Young. I like every song on this cd. He definately gets a 5 star rating from me.
5,Love it!,"I'm a huge Chris Young fan and wish I would've bought this CD a whole lot sooner. I think my favorite song off this CD is ""You're Gonna Love Me."" This CD will not disappoint - buy it today! :)"
4,Chris Young,"Chris Young has a very good voice and I look for him to become one of our up and coming young stars. He has some good songs. I liked listening to his voice and the more times I heard this cd the better I liked it. It is a good one to have. I especially liked ""Flowers""."
5,Best in the Dream Series,"I really enjoyed this book. Usually the first in the trilogies is the best but not in this case, at least not for me. There is something about men who don't think they're good enough for their love interest that captures my heart. Michael Fury friend to Josh, Laura's brother is renting a place with stables at the Templetons. Laura who was mistreated by her first husband is in my opinion, the sweetest of the three friends. I love the connection they make. The entire story was interesting and heartwarming as Laura's daughters connect with this father figure. I only wish that not all of Ms. Robert's stories have the couple realizing they are both in love until the last page of the book. I would rather enjoy reading a little of the happiness in the marriage for at least one chapter rather than the last page of the story. Neverthless, a great read, and in my opinion, the best in the Dream trilogy."
5,Very Good Trilogy,This is a wonderful trilogy. I highly recommend it if anyone is looking for some good books to read. A great beach read!
5,Dream Trilogy,"Once again, addictive series. Loved the three books. A true escape from the daily grind.,The Dream trilogy is top notch Nora Roberts."
1,It is not what you see in the picture,This coat is a big disappointment. What I have received is not what you see in the picture. I have also tried to return the item but the supplier conditioned me to send me the return number if I change my honest feedback. I will give away this for charity.
4,"mostly positive, good value","Service from seller was great. Coat was as expected from reading reviews. Very good deal, even with shipping about half the price of the same jacket at Army-Navy Outlet stores in my area. Fit well, my son has not worn it yet, because it hasn't been that cold, but seems like weight is as described. Coat arrived with button missing, but found button in packaging & I was able to sew it back on & reinforce others. This was mentioned in another review. I think buttons were not sewn on very well (As is the case with many new garments now!) For me this was not a big issue and not worth returning. Good coat for the price."
1,peacoat,the coat was not what was expected. had an oily residue and odd smell. i would not recommend to anyone
4,Pea Coat Purchase,"The Pea Coat was a Christmas gift to my Son, who is a college student. Initially we had some difficulty getting the size right but after a return and a reorder, it arrived quickly and our Son is happy. It seems like a good value, as the coat seems well made and finished nicely while costing considerable less than others we looked at."
5,They don't make rodeo cowboys any sexier than this!,"The McCabes of Texas series is back with a story about Shane. The ""bad boy"" and baby brother of the McCabe clan, Shane is as rugged and wild as the Texas land he was raised on. Good girl Greta Wilson had always been in love with Shane, and in awe of his fun lovin' escapades, but she also knew he was not the cowboy for her, as not even a stampede of wild horses could get that cowboy down the aisle. Until, that is, Shane and Greta's mothers hatched a matchmaking scheme that landed the two together in bed! Then they'll do whatever it takes to prove to one and all they are not a match made in Texas! Even if that means getting married! This book is a lot of fun, and romantic to boot!"
5,GREAT LISTENING!,"Was looking for guitar music, listened to samples then bought. This is now my favorite CD to listen to. I highly recommend to anyone who wants music that raises their spirits. Great background music for get togethers also!"
3,"nice bag, inefficient space","This bag was of the typical high quality of Lowepro products, but the design created an inefficiency of space and as a serious traveler, I need to maximize efficiency. I returned it for a different Lowepro product."
5,THIS BOOK IS NON-FICTION AT ITS BEST.,"KEITH WILLIAM NOLAN HAS WRITTEN A FAST PACED ACCOUNT OF ONE OF THE BLOODIEST BATTLES OF THE VIET NAM WAR. FOR THOSE OF US WHO WERE THERE THE DATE APRIL 30,1968 IS BURNED INTO OUR MEMORY FOREVER. MR. NOLAN HAS DONE HIS RESEARCH AND HAS TOLD OUR STORY HONESTLY. HE TELLS THE STORY BY INTERMINGLING FIRST PERSON ACCOUNTS INTO A COMPLETE STORY OF THE BATTLE. THE GOOD AND THE BAD ARE PRESENTED. THE HEROISM AND THE FAILURES ARE ALL THERE FOR THE READER TO SEE. THIS BOOK TELLS THE STORY OF MARINES FIGHTING ON THE DMZ DURING THE SPRING AND SUMMER OF 1968. IF YOU WERE THERE;THIS IS YOUR STORY. IF YOU WERE NOT;THIS IS HOW IT REALLY WAS. THIS BOOK IS A GOOD READ AND A GREAT TRUE STORY TOLD BY A MASTERFUL STORYTELLER."

2,Hasn't worked yet !,"I have a very thick, hypertrophied scar on my abdomen from gastric bypass surgery. The top of the scar gets very irritated while wearing a bra. I was hoping this product would thin the scar out, thus creating less friction. Unfortunately, it has not so far. I will continue to use it, however, because the box does say it could take up to three months. I have been only using it for a few weeks and, admittedly, there are days when I have not put it on. (while wearing it, though, with tape holding it in place, gotta admit the bra doesn't irritate it, so that's a good sign, right?) lol................."
4,Top notch Pop-punk,The Fiendz blend the caffinated Descendents/ALL progressive pop-punk stylings with the harmonies of the Beach Boys for a vigorously entertaining disk.
2,Wanna know Bayesian? Get another one.,"This book is a famous one. However I fail to see why. It is neither theoretical enough to give deep insight, nor practical and broad enough to cover most useful tools and algorithms. Maybe because the author is a much better salesman than a researcher. If you want to know Bayesian, get a real classic, like James O. Berger. I give it 2 stars, since there is even worse book about Bayesian out there."
1,You Know You're In Trouble When They Can't Afford Horses!,"You know you're in trouble when they can't afford horses and the actors have to pull the carts!As much as I like Eric Roberts, this movie sucked. It was boring, the dialog was stilted, the fight coreography sloppy, and there was very little of Eric Roberts in it. He's a fine actor, but he just couldn't carry this movie by himself and nobody else was helping.You can watch this as a family movie, but it would probably bore the kids to death.If it were possible to give a film no stars, this would be it! So save your money, and if you want to buy a really good Eric Roberts film, I suggest Nature of the Beast, with Lance Heinricksen (one of Eric's best bad guy rolls!)or Race Against Time (he actually plays the good guy in this one!)."
1,"The worst film ever made, and I mean ever!!!!","(...)I have never written a review here, but I hated this movie so much I had no choice but to warn people of this hidious excuse for wasted film. Eric Roberts has two minuted of screen time in a flim that must have payed at most a month's rent for this faded b-movie soon to be where are they now actor. It was like a bad Xena mixed with a highschool film project. Who ever payed for this to be made on DVD new how to con people, the cover has swordfights, horses and battle scenes, none of which appear in this movie. Man it was the worst ever, please never watch this for the love of mercy..."
5,"Clarity, results, contribution","This is an essential text for anyone who manages people. Daniels is clearly 'for' creating a workplace that taps the innate desire to contribute and against one run by fear. I've seen nearly 35 years of organizational life, as employee, manager and consultant. That's a lot of fads, slogans and philosophies. This book is the real deal.When people are managed using these clear, rigorous, objective principles, stress and interpersonal barriers decrease, work exceeds expectations. I also recommend Dr. Marshall Rosenberg's ""Nonviolent Communication""."
5,"I loved it, too ...","I am not given to romantic stories but this one is the exception. Lucy Walter was treated badly by historians but her lineage contributed to the rise of democracy in Great Britain and her ancestry, maligned by historians as ""low born"" was anything but - in fact, she shares a set of great-great-grandparents (8-10X removed) with Diana Spencer and the current heir to the British throne, William. This book treats her fairly and in a beautiful and compelling story and, like one of the other reviewers here, I re-read it every 4-5 years or so. It never fails to move me."
3,Not the Cult,"I picked up this cd fairly cheap after reading one of the reviews here on Amazon. The reviewer was dead-on. Do not expect the Cult's music, but we all hoped it would sound a little like them anyway. But, even on a bad day for the Cult, this music would not pass as theirs. Some of the sounds do rock okay, but nothing stellar. I disagree with the reviewer that dismissed ""Blind"". It is the only song that could pass for Ian's former music quality, sort of Love inspired rocker tune, that is really the best of this set. If you must collect Cult-ish music, and I agree, if you can get it cheap, pick it up, just don't bloat your expectations. I recently changed my rating to 3 stars from 2. Listening to the cd a few more times did help."
3,"An ""OK"" book for Christians","John Ankerburg was kinda big in the 90's so I gave this book a shot. I'll keep it around as a reference work, but there are much better books about Jesus out there."
4,From India to the Planet Mars!,"Though this book was written over 100 years ago, the study of a person who claims to have been an Indian Princess, Marie Antoinette, and had contact with people on Mars is fascinating. What drove Helene Smith to concoct these fantasies is handled in a humane and understanding fashion by the psychologist author and rather than being a book about busting her claims it provides insight into why she needed them. A very good read if you have every wondered why people insist on deluding themselves."
3,"It's not really 60"" ... very deceiving.","It works fine, great to shoot thru and to bounce light off of, but it's not 60"", they should rename the product to reflect the real size. Very deceiving."
5,Very informative,If you want to learn about lightening without too much science this is a great book. Very well written by a top scientist in the field.
3,Could have done without...,"I bought this book because I really thought that it would help me stay healthy while I was pregnant. I read the book cover to cover and found a lot of things in it to be well weird. I believe in being healthy especially when you have another person to worry about but I don't have enough time in the day to measure everything I eat and some of the suggests were just weird. Plus a lot of the information from this book you can find in the ""What to Expect Book"" in the diet section. Overall if you are going to take the time to really make sure you follow a diet, this is the book for you. If you are someone who isn't going to measure or count calories, don't bother buying this book."
2,I WISH the numbers were right...,"I bought this scale to replace my previous scale with body fat option. It was not easy to use, as you HAVE TO put in your information unless you want to use kilograms, and you still have to enter your height in meters. All that aside, it continues to tell me that my body fat is between 14 and 15%. Am I an athlete? No. Am I female? Yes. Is 14% body fat possible??? Well let's just say it is HIGHLY unlikely. I can't comment on the water numbers it gives me because I don't really have anything to go on there, but even at my fittest I was over 20% body fat, and that was a while ago..."
3,Is the Meneaito the Meneito or Meneito the Meneaito,"The only hit song I am aware of was recorded by Gaby (Winston Brown) in 1989, and produced by Big Daddy G. and Luis Phillips. It was released by BMG, and hit big time in Europe as well as Latin America. It seems there are two (2) versions of the same song- Meneaito by Gaby, and Meneito by Sweet Edition. After listening to them both, they are very similar. I also noticed that the same writer is credited for both versions! This must have created major problems for the publisher(s). In any case, I prefer the Meneaito by Gaby, which is available on Amazon.com from both the Panjam CD, Ragga Dance CD, or Traficantes ""La Segunda Entrega"""
1,what???,I thought this book was confusing. I had to read the book twice to understand it. I would not recommend this book to some one that wants adventure on the first page. This book takes time to get to the adventure. I dislike how the author did not put a lot description of the setting and the characters. I didn't get a good visual of the characters. This book is in a sear. The second book gets a little of the adventure. You have to read the sears to get every little clue. In the back of the book you see six kids. From the description of the book you do not know who's who. This book is for patient people that can wait for the adventure. If I was a teacher and I was grading this paper I would give this paper a C.
3,No headset jack,"Electronically, a decent phone. But note there's no headset jack, unlike its white model in the same series. Weird."
1,Like music from a 1950's TV ad,"A bit disappointed. The 3 disc set contains less than an hour of total music. The vocals are overdone on 2 of the discs. If you want great theremin music, get a copy of ""The Art of the Theremin"" by Clara Rockmore. She is awesome. It just doesn't get better. The soundtrack from ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" has terrific theremin sounds too."
3,Interesting but nothing innovative,"A great deal of the projects in this book are basically various forms of X10 module automation. The projects include how to automate a light with motion sensing, how to remotely monitor your pet, creating a whole house audio or time shifted audio, a keyless entry system, and intrusion detection and deterrence. For each project the items are detailed, the software described in detail, information is included on where to locate them, assembly instructions, scripts, and everything else you need to complete it. Only basic skills are needed for each project. Each project includes information on estimated cost, time and difficulty ratings so you can easily decide which ones you will tackle and which ones you may not want to. Home Hacking Projects for Geeks is recommended to anyone wanting to have a little fun with home electronics."
4,They really work,Have used for a long time for arthritis pain and they really work for me. Would recommend anyone try them and see for yourself
2,"""Bird season's over, butthorn.""","One of the best BAD movies of all time, and believe me this is bad. Busey fans will love this thing.Two of Hollywood's top heavies in William Smith and Henry Silva, team with Gary Busey to concoct a Soviet backed thriller in MEXICO of all places, and Silva is so confounded by the stupidity of the script he forgets he's a Mexican and swears to Allah when things start to go wrong. Believe it, I swear to Allah. haw hawDarlanne Fluegel makes an appearance as the hottest Army Captain ever to appear in film, or the hottest Army whatever....well wait a minute, my GF was in the Army and she's pretty hot but now that I think about it I'd much rather Darlanne be scrubbing down my turret if you knowhudahmsayin? Watch the movie, its about an experimental supertank kidnapped by the Mexicans, Just hilarious and semi ridiculous. Thankee."
1,Seriously don't waste your money,Being that I loved the anime Chrono Crusade. I decide to actually go and buy the Soundtrack.Yet when i first heard it i though it was some kind of serious joke. This soundtrack is only 47 minutes long. Now if you think of it clearly for a momment 47 minutes and a cd can clearly hold up to 80 minutes as far as I know. Ok theres one think but what really makes my blood boil is that they didnt put the intro theme or the ending theme of chrono crusade. As for their little joke they put the tv cut thats about 1 1/2 minute long. Now i though i about it clearly for a second then i wonder why am i paying for a soundtrack that doesnt even have the theme song to it? Well I after this i decide to never buy a anime soundtrack ever agian. I dont really have to undergo this kind of treatment as a sountrack teaser of some sort that all the tracks are no more than 2 minutes long
1,VERY DISSAPOINTED,"Uno is a great card game. I bought this ""king size"" Uno, for my four year old daughter. What a surprise when we received it to find out that the cards are half the size they advertise. If I wanted to buy a regular size deck, I would have looked for one, this was supposed to be king size, the cards are half the size of a regular size card."
1,"bad, bad, bad","I had the same problem as others re the door jamming and crunching tape. In addition, the cassette was very hard to extract from the rewinder. I was able to push the door back in place and a multi hundred dollar video job was saved. As soon as I was able to input to my pc, the rewinder went to the trash. I am using my canon elura 100 as my rewind device until my new rewinder arrives. Bad, bad, bad."
2,Sizing chart wrong,"I followed the sizing chart provided on the web page and ordered small, but now I can barely put them on and barely take them out (the taking out is so annoying). They will be a good present for my friend that has small hands!"
3,Sizes are marked incorrectly,"I got this from my local 24Hr Fitness. They look ok and made to be sold for $15. However, be careful with the sizing. I found that size L was too small for my hands, but since my gym only had them in Large size, I tried all of 7 them they had in stock and found that 3 pairs labeled Large fits my hand comfortably and 4 pairs labeled Large didn't fit at all. So, I am glad I didn't got it from the internet.My left glove is cutting the web between the ring finger and middle finger. I am hoping some more use to it should make it comfortable.Overall, they will do the job and not bad at all at this price. Just be prepared to deal with incorrect sizing."
2,Bad fit for my hands,"Didn't like these gloves, I have small hands and bought medium since the reviews said they run a little small. Still too big! I guess they are ok for lifting dumb bells, but for pulling exercises doesn't help..back, pull ups."
4,Does the Job,"With all things this review is pretty much a pro and con list of things that I've experienced personally with my gloves.After 2 weeks of 2 a day training in them I've a pretty good feel for their abilities and short comings.PRO: The glove itself has good hand/finger coverage in general. The padding in the palms is thin enough for pulling exercises but there is enough there to help support heavier weight when you are doing a pushing exercise (i.e. bench press).CON: I've been a large in every other glove I have wore, I ordered the XL just in case they ran small and found that even the XL sized gloves are smaller than the typical glove (they did stretch out after a day or so).Overall: I'd recommend these gloves. Heavy lifters might want to seek out a Harbinger brand with more padding. I have yet to wash them due to the fraying around the wrist area and would like to get my $ value before testing their washing/drying durability."
4,Quite Comfortable,"My experience using this pair is limited due to injury (nothing to do with thse gloves), but I did not have any issue with the gloves."
2,Maybe its just me...and a few others,"After doing some research and reading a number of reviews I purchased this product. 1)I totally agree with the previous posts that said that the gloves ran small. I too ordered an XL since all my other gloves were XL and they were at least a size too small. And to the person who says this complaint is idiotic because leather stretches...leather also tightens when it gets wet. No need to name call, it is what it is. 2)These gloves have ZERO padding whatsoever! I got on the bench press and couldn't do what I normally do due to the discomfort. Felt like all the weight was resting on my wrists. 3)The stitching is perfectly imperfect!All in all, if I had baby hands and lifted 10lb weights these might be ok gloves. Unfortunately for me that's not the case. The search continues..."
1,IT NEVER COME,I BOUGHT THIS ITEM AND IT NEVER COME !!! WHY I DONT KNOW BUT IT NEVER COME TO MY HOUSE
3,Bulky but does the job,"I have been lifting free weights for the past year and decided it was finally time to try using some gloves to minimize the damage the weights were doing to my hands. After reading through the reviews, I bought the Harbinger Pro FlexClosure Wash & Dry Gloves. While the gloves themselves do the job, they seem to be bulkier than they need to be which sometimes makes me feel less comfortable lifting heavier weights. Overall not a bad product for the money, but if you are looking for something slim then I would look elsewhere."
4,"Tight fit, but comfortable","Make sure to size up a little bit, otherwise the gloves are great. I haven't had any problems with blistering after purchasing the gloves."
4,great gloves but run one size too small,"these gloves are great. well made and a great upgrade from the regular harbinger gloves. try them on in a store first though, they run about one size smaller than you'd expect and from the non-pro version."
3,"Meh, it hurts the webbing b/w my fingers","The glove I got fits okay (only a tiny bit loose), but the fitting isn't the problem. The gloves dig into the webs between your fingers and when your hand start sweating, it really starts to sting and hurt.Stopped using them but still giving 3 stars because they're well made."
2,Save Your Money!!!,"I really had to laugh as I read some of the reviews because it seemed as if the words could have been coming out of my mouth. This book was extremely disappointing and misleading. I consider myself to be an intelligent person but I found the book difficult to follow, especially in the beginning. I kept trying to give it a chance and finally finished it because I hated the thought of having wasted my money. The author definitely seemed to be trying too hard to portray a ""ghetto"" that he obviously never lived in or visited. The slang was corny. The book focused more on 2 ""hitmen"" than ghetto girls. Perhaps the author should stick to topics with which he is familiar. It almost seemed as if he wrote a book based on stereotypical images of how the media often portrays people in the ""ghetto""."
2,Awful,This book is in my top 10 list of the worst books I've ever read! It started off ok but something went terribly wrong. Never again will I buy Mr. Whyte's books.
1,slow and no scanning,"Pros: bluetooth adaptor installs easily and is recognized immediately, even on my mac computer. Cons: prints SLOWLY, and does NOT allow scaning. After reading the product info, this adaptor makes no mention of scanning, regardless of your computer os. IMHO, bluetooth is not ready for prime time."
2,could be better,"well, its a nice idea but when in use the device changes the printing rate from very fast to very slow...it seeems as though it reads the info as it prints, but it reads in short bursts rather than quick and continuous...usb works much faster but it uses up one of the ports....oh, well...better luck next time"
4,Not too bad.,"It was a decent belt for a decent price, not too bad. And it got here in a reasonable amount of time."
5,It works like it should.,"I haven't really pushed the limits of this thing but i did pull a heavily leaning 25 foot cypress tree back to vertical with it.It is simple to use, US made, and seems to be well constructed."
4,very good product,i like the fact that it also shows KG. It is very accurate and an all around good product!
5,One Heck of a Great Book,"This is one heck of a great book. I loved every second of reading it. It's not just an entertainment book, either. Yes, it's exciting, mesmerising, and scary as hell to read the descriptions of shark/human encounters, some just nose bumps on a surfboard, others far more lethal. But it's also written from a completely sincere wish to understand shark behavior. I felt like I understood a lot more about sharks in general, and Great Whites in particular, after reading it. I also never want to go surfing after reading the book. Not that I ever wanted to surf to begin with...It's not that you're guaranteed to have a shark encounter every time you surf, it's just that I'll never forget the stories I read in here--they're so incredibly fascinating and terrifying. I just wish there was a second volume to this wonderful book!"
2,False advertising,"Although the book does have some good content, I bought the book specifically based on the front cover claim that it included free MP3 audio files of the book.Well it doesnt. I have registered the book on Syngress.com, downloaded the ebook and sent messages to the author and syngress. As yet still no mp3 files or even replies to my messages.The book may well be worth buying, but dont base your decision on the claims on the front cover."
1,Warning: this product makes babies cry,"So my 15 month old child cries at most diaper changes because it cuts into her busy schedule. So I had no idea that this cream may be painful to apply to red irritated skin. She rarely has rashes but I bought this cream for the occasional redness. I LOVE the other California Baby products such as the shampoo/wash and bubble bath and feel they are well worth the price. This on the other hand is a total waste. My 2 year old niece on the other hand is able to verbally communicate pain and I felt horrible when I realized that this cream made her immediately cry out in pain and start yelling ""Ow"" like I've never heard before. I tried it one more time on my daughter and realized that applying the cream really does escalate the tears more then not. This product is aweful and I'll be getting a refund ASAP."
1,Made my baby daughter scream!,This cream smells really good and I used it for a while when my DD didn't have a rash. I bought it because it is cloth diaper friendly. But the first time I used it on a rash she screamed the second it touched her skin! I felt so awful! I have talked to three other cd moms who have also tried this who threw it out after the first use on a rash. What good is a rash cream that you can't use on a rash?!?!For now I am just using Triple Paste (my favorite miracle rash cream! Love it!) putting a flannel cloth wipe against her skin between her and the cloth diaper. And I just placed an order for CJ's BUTTer which was recommended to me by another cd mom. So we'll see how tht works for us.BOTTOM LINE: I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS CREAM. (At least until California Baby takes note of all the bad reviews and reworks the formula.)
2,not worth the shipping,"The cream isn't bad, and has a nice smell, but once I saw the size of the tube I realized that it wasn't worth the extra shipping cost to have this exact diaper cream."
1,Turned her red!,"I bought this for my 22 month old because I am trying to use more natural products on her, I used it once! When I first put it on she started saying ""hurt hurt"" but stopped after a min or so and didn't freak out so I figured maybe it was just an uncomfortable feeling. But when I changed her next diaper her private parts area was bright red (had used on her butt too but that was fine). I will not being using this again. I also want to add I have never had this happen with any diaper or body cream before."
1,Baby Screams when this product is used,"I tried using this over Dr. Smith's Diaper Rash cream since I thought it would be more gentle on the skin but our baby screams and cries seconds after this product is applied. There must be something irritating that causes pain. Once it is removed with a wet washcloth, he's back to being a happy baby again. I would recommend a different product if your baby has sensitive skin."
1,Baby cries!,"I love all the other CA baby stuff I have! But my little girl screamed as soon as I put this on! I only got it because our regular diaper cream, Desert Essence Organics, was out of stock. I will be returning it tomorrow. I cloth diaper, and her little bum was just slightly red, I can't imagine if she had a real diaper rash how she would have reacted. Please be careful with your baby bottoms!"
3,A Good film about the perils of broadcast TV,"This film is a funny look behind the scenes at a News station. Kathleen Turner, Burt Reynolds and Christopher Reeve make a funny trio, Reynolds being the boss and jealous ex husband of Kathleen Turner, Reeve the new romantic attraction of Turner in a refreshing role that takes him away from Superman. What follows is them trying to get a convicted cop killer Ike Roscoe from getting the electric chair. And Reynolds doing everything in his power to stop Turner from marrying Reeve which involves him ssending him up a lift in a skyscraper when he has a serious case of vertigo (one of the best scenes in the movie) and having his assistants ring up the airport and train centres trying to book up every flight that goes out to New York This is a very funny film and worth a watch"
3,Great but still boring,"This CD has some higlights which will be difficult to forget. It is great when it is a two men's show (Murray and Marsalis). The band, however, doesn't quite live up to Murray's standard, creating more of a background sound and offering very little creative interplay. Fast Life - and too fast a recording!"
2,LAME,"Not much of a story line, dull FPS. No new ground here. Took about 4 hrs total...save your money."
2,"Has it's moments, but not really worth it","Rather than come out with a new Kate Archer game, the folks at Fox/Sierra/Monolith pushed out this overly short, ultimately senseless game to capitalize on the No One Lives Forever franchise.The gameplay itself isn't bad and at times rather fun; I really enjoyed a few of the levels, but ultimately, it all fell rather flat. It lacked the enjoyment, humor and fun factor of the other No One Lives Forever games. It didn't help that the main character was a dud.If you can get this for free and you have extra time on your hands, it's worth a spin; otherwise avoid it."
2,Story & humor not up to NOLF2 standards,"My copy was waiting at home for me last night, and I'm currently about half-way through (after 2.5 hours of playing).It doesn't engage me the way NOLF2 did. The graphics are pretty, gameplay works just fine, and as someone else has stated, it's more stable than NOLF2 was when it first came out. But there's little or no humor, the story is just plodding along, and I'm not really caring about what happens next. I just want to finish it.After playing through the single-player game, I'll be trying out the multiplayer games. The only new one I see is Demolition. If this isn't radically more fun than Doomsday then I'll just go back to my NOLF2 nightly playtime, and Contract Jack can go to EBay.[ST] BSR"
5,Super!!!,"My boyfriend and I are huge Pink Floyd fans. We had an upcoming tribute band concert at the ""House of Blues"" in downtown Cleveland and I wanted to get this shirt for my boyfriend to wear to the concert. My boyfriend is very happy with the shirt, he wears it quite often. The Amazon service is spectacular, shipping was incredibly fast!!!!. As always, Amazon rocks!!!!! Thanks Amazon!!!!!!!!!!"
5,A Fascinating Look Into Madness,"Possibly one of the best horror novels ever written, The Fog is the story of a government-made fog-like substance that escapes from underground storage following an earthquake. Originally intended for warfare, it causes insanity in those it touches and leaves death and destruction in its wake. It is up to the desperate government scientists of Britain and a man first exposed to the fog to stop it before it destroys the world. As well as having an engaging story about a team working around the clock to stop the insidious fog, the novel is peppered with grisly vignettes describing in detail the effects on the people who come in contact with it; for example a town full of people rush to the ocean in a mass suicide, a private school for boys turns into an orgy of mutilation and murder, and pigeons attack their owner viciously. Providing suspense, fright and all-out goriness, The Fog is a must-read for any self-respecting horror fan."
3,Quick read if you can forgive some predictable outcomes,An interest grabbing page flipping relatively easy flowing plot; poor characterisations though. Zero character development: a very much in-your-face paper thin characters-driven-by-plot figures; almost hitchcock like small excitements for the occasional diversion. Good read on the train! JH must have written it on one too!
3,Lots of death,"Just about every way to die imaginable is in this book, just as you get to know a character, they are executed in some gruesome fashion...but i did like it. Good ending, something good to read but J A Konraths books are better."
4,One of the better Buffy books,"This is the second Buffy book that Gallagher has written and she has come up with compelling plots both times. The first (Obsidian Fate) was marred by some inexcusable errors but this title is much better in that regard. A teacher is putting the whammy on Buffy, but given her lack of enthusiasm for history, Buffy thinks it's understandable. But there's much more at stake here, and soon Willow is being drawn into the teacher's spell along with Anya and others. Gallagher incorporates tidbits from the television episodes as well as from other books in the Buffy series, which heightens the sense of continuity. I would have liked for Angel to have had a bigger role, buth otherwise this is a much more successful effort than her first. Buffy fans should enjoy it."
2,surprised,"Used book (not Amazon) - appearance as advertized. Unfortunately, it has a moldy oder. Will probably NOT buy another used book for fear of the same problem."
5,Jesus & Mary Chain on Doo-Wop...,"That was the way I first heard this band described, by guitarist (and Slumberland head honcho) Mike Schulman. Pam Berry's ethereal, almost impenetrable vocals wash over fuzzed out guitars in the sweetest little broken-hearted songs... eventually, you find yourself singing ""just throw her off the bridge, we both know it's gotta be done"" and being downright happy about it because you know exactly how much that crush and that unrequited, unnoticed love hurts. Perfect gray-day music from what was easily the best of the first-generation Slumberland bands."
2,Find the Same Information Free Online,"I ordered this book hoping to get some insight into my digestive issues. It turned out to be little more than a pamphlet - half of which was the history behind the author's own medical issues which were unrelated to digestion. He provided the same reasons you can find online for Ileocecal valve issues, and the offered a single diet solution to address all of them - despite the fact that some could be caused by specific foods. Overall too simplistic and lacking in good information. Most likely if you're having digestive issues, you need to find a more in depth book that can offer more diagnosis options and solutions."
5,Empowering,"Interesting methods for group cooperation. Anticipates common disharmonies and provides easy, compassionate strategies for keeping connection. Contains challenging exercises and, for those who prefer to practice alone, serves as an excellent solo NVC journey guide."
1,Unreliable,"This toy was fun for an hour or two until the pins quit resetting. I called the manufacturer and they sent replacement parts, but it still doesn't work. Fun but not reliable."
2,Broke next day,My kids really liked it until it broke the next day. There was nothing we could do to fix it as it had an electronic problem.
2,The Spiritual in Art,I wish I had known that this was a former library book. I would have thought twice about purchasing it as it is more worn than it was described in the brief.
4,One of my favorite toe rings!,"It lasted about a year before the finish started to wear off a little bit. This might be due to how often I wore it in sand, water, etc. I still wear it though -- it's too adorable not to, and just fine without the darker finish. Adjustable size = maximum comfort. Recommended!"
2,Just okay,"I love how well this sheet cooridinates with the theme and fits the crib. However, after 2 months of use..the sheet has developed those little fabric ""pebbles"" (for lack of a better term) only on the area where the baby lies. They are easily removed with a fabric shaver, but I'm surprised this would happen at all with a baby sheet. In retrospect, the sheet itself is not as soft as I would like for an infant."
4,Good Value,Movement is great; it keeps good time. Plating on bracelet not complete but you have to look real hard to tell. The bezel was stiff at first but remedied with use. Made a fellow watch collector and owner of a Rolex jealous.
1,Good to play with!,"I bought this watch on sale on a whim because it was so cheap -- an incredible deal! After taking one shower, it got condensation inside -- so much for the 200m diver rating. I opened the back and saw that it has no real gasket to speak of. After letting it air dry, I got rid of the condensation. Knowing that I had just voided the dodgy warranty on a cheap watch by opening the case back, I used this as my tinkering watch to learn how to adjust automatic movements. For that purpose, this watch rocks. The experience I gained was priceless! The watch itself, worthless. If you want an affordable automatic that's actually well made, look at Orient or Seiko."
3,British Musical Classic,"The musicality, from an American perspective with our long history of great musical shows, is somewhat lacking. Perhaps the theatricality of the live stage version made up for its' shortcomings!?! I had hoped for more. An interesting addition to your collection in terms of British musical theater history."
1,Minotaur,I pre-ordered this game...even 2 months ahead...and found it quite boring. I didn't even wanted to finish the first mission. Maybe just because I tried this game right after I got addicted with OFP...I have thrown my money to the ditch...
2,Don't let the cover fool you,"This movie was supposed to be a thriller, but frankly, it wasn't very thrilling. Keri Wuhrer and Farrah Forke are gorgeous actresses, but don't buy this movie if you just want to see them.The first half moved very slow, then when things got interesting in the middle, it suddenly wound down its course to the inevitable end."
5,An artist who merits being included among the best,"Close To So Far""is very satisfying, by an artist who meritsbeing included among the best of his contemporary pianoplaying peers. Recommended. - Dave Nathan, allmusicguide.com"
2,This book is very silly.,"I am finishing this book only because I found it roaming free as a BookCrossing book and feel obligated to read it and comment on it before rereleasing it. It is a Biblical/classical fantasy that includes bee-women with webbed feet, David/Jonathan slash fiction, and Goliath as a Cyclops. Very silly indeed, and seemingly entirely unaware of its silliness. The cover picture does a pretty good job of carrying the sense of it."
3,Really huge nipple,"These pacifiers are gigantic. I ended up not giving them to my son because they are so much bigger from the other pacifiers he's using. I just didn't want him to get used to this one and not use the other ones I have purchased. Since my son never used them, I really can't say how the quality of these are."
5,ARDMS,The CD that goes along with this book is thorough and very helpful. I passed the abdomen exam with a high score and no poblems; (I had previously failed this exam when using the appleton and lange review book;-big yellow waste of money-)This book is definitely a good buy.
2,Good little speaker if you don't need customer service,"I have purchased a few pairs of Sima speakers. Sima has reduced the size and features of their powered speakers to this 8"" which is unfortunate because the old 10"" were just barely adequate for the advertised purpose. Other than that, this is a good speaker value for the price if you don't require any customer service. I would have rated these speakers 4 stars if not for the apparant incompetance of Sima. I have a problem with one of these speakers which may or may not be a defect, but SIMA CUSTOMER SERVICE DOES NOT APPEAR TO EXIST. Repeated e-mails and phone calls have gone unanswered and unreturned. As much as I felt these speakers are a decent value, I can not purchase any more products from Sima since they seem to be a company which runs and hides from customers who call for service. Save yourself the aggravation I feel and look elsewhere for speakers."
1,Really?,"The listed running time is one minute - so with 10 episodes on the disc that makes each episode 6 seconds - really? Come on, if you're going to advertise it for sale know a few things about it first or just refuse to list it. I also agree that a list of the episodes on the disc (6 seconds long or not) would be helpful. We all know the quality is going to suck but some folks are still interested."
2,Why does Everyone like this Book?,"Honestly, I thought it was a little boring. I wish I could agree with the others, but I labored to finish it. Maybe this writer is just not for me. The book certainly didn't make me want to turn the pages. I know the author has a huge following but this one didn't do it for me."
4,Great Series!!,"""I really liked this book, as was very well written and hard to put down! I have read all the Mickey Haller Series; however, not the Bosch series, so was pleasantly surprised.Harry (which was mentioned in the Haller series) walked away from the job three years ago. But Harry Bosch cannot resist the call to join the elite Open/Unsolved Unit. His mission: solve murders whose investigations were flawed, stalled, or abandoned to L.A.'s tides of crime (which there are many). Suspense and thrills as they uncover a murder of 17 yrs ago and all the players involved -A must read. I look forward to reading the entire series!"""
3,"Bosch's Back -- Rusty, but Still Entertaining","Det. Harry Bosch is back with the LAPD, in a special unit that investigates cold cases. He's a bit rusty, losing control of interrogations, letting his cell phone chirp while he's casing a suspect's home. But he still has great instincts.This book focuses on the murder of a teen-age girl. Was it a hate crime? A police cover-up? Something more sinister? Bosch hits soup kitchens, prep schools, anywhere the trail takes him.The story is compelling, and Bosch is a very human and likeable detective. Connelly does a good job of getting the reader inside the cop's mindset. He nails details, like the reporter's working relationship with her photographer. It's an enjoyable read.Parts of the book seemed to move slowly. But overall it was a great installment about a great character."
4,The Closers,"Who doesn't love the complicated and unexpected ways of Harry Bosch? I enjoyed the story, the characters and the plot and can't wait for Connelly's next book."
4,Harry Bosh at his best,The book is fantastic. Michael Connelly is a master of the crime genre and knows very well the police procedures and internal afairs. Since the first pages you can see it's an unputdownable book.
4,A Great Bosch Book,"This puts Connelly back on better footing. Although the city and agency politics are interesting and give life to a world that is often unfamiliar to readers, murder investigations are where the author and Harry Bosch are at their best."
2,I'm Done After 202 Boring Pages!,"I've read most, if not all, of Michael Connelly's novels, including all of the other Harry Bosch books. Had this one pre-ordered. But now, after 202 incredibly boring pages, I am setting it aside.I suppose if you really, really like the ""procedural"" part of ""police procedural"" meaning that you are just fascinated with every damn thing a couple of cops might do during their first day on a new case, those 202 pages might interest you. If a politically-correct liberal slant on every subject makes you feel comfortable, then this book will please you. But the book has not interested or pleased me. Yawn!Maybe I'm just spoiled from recently reading Peter Abrahams' ""A Perfect Crime""."
3,"Solid story, good beach read","Harry Bosch is one of my favorite fictional detectives, and it is good to see him back. Michael Connelly is one of the best, but this time he falls a little short. The plot seems a bit too contrived, and the characters almost too predictable. Not a completely unsatisfying effort, but for a top notch Bosch novel, The Blue Echo or Concrete Blond are better places to start if you haven't yet tried Connelly."
2,Connelly is past his prime,"Michael Connelly's early books were fine reading, with engaging characters and excellent plots. He used to be the master of the unexpected plot twist(s) at the end. His books have, unfortunatley, gone progressively downhill. His latest, ""The Closers,"" shows that he finally has lost his touch. It clunks along with thin characters and stiff writing. The dialog usually is pathetic- if he didn't label who was speaking, you couldn't tell them apart, as all of the dialog is stiff and uninteresting. He seems to think that all cops talk like Jack Webb - and all the rest of us do, too. The plot is, at best, so-so. None of the characters is remotely likable. Harry Bosch comes off as gloomy and guilty about everything - just neurotic, not very interesting. If I wasn't a fan from his earlier books, I couldn't have finished this one."
4,Bosch re-cycled,"Harry Bosch returns to the LAPD after a number of years in the cold outside world. He is back where he belongs, on the side of the victims. He is glad to be back but is left in no doubt that he could be back out in the cold just as quickly should he step ot of line. He is in the 'Open-Unsolved' unit where he is teamed up with his old partner Kiz Rider and their first case is the 17 year old murder of a teenage girl.Harry is a bit rusty and it shows! This is not the page turner that previous Harry Bosch novels have been, there are unconvincing plots and sub-plots that do not always hold together and the writing is not just as sharp as is normal for Michael Connelly.It is still an enjoyable read and, of course, essential for all those who follow Harry Bosch's life and career avidly. If it had been my first Michael Connelly it would not make rush out to buy another, but it's not and I will continue to read the books of this very fine author."
4,An excellent Bosch novel,"I've read all of Connelley's novels and have greatly enjoyed almost all of them. The Narrows is an excellent police procedural and one of the better written mysteries I've read in some time. The case in question is engaging and interesting and unfolds at a good pace. I'd have rated the book a 5 but it's a touch lacking in action and/or drama. That said, it's a very enjoyable read."
1,This book sucks!!!!,I am on page 256 and I WILL NOT waste my time reading the rest. At this point I don't care who killed the girl. There was never any good back ground on her to care what happened to her. Harry Bouch is a boring person and I really don't care about what he is doing. I can't believe that this got good reviews.
5,Great !!,"Wow, what a great read. This was almost as exciting as the time that Lebron dunked on Kobe on 12/16/2008 -- and this author is so much better than Patterson and even Coben.. Cant wait for the next book.. Go Heat."
2,boring,"I have liked Connelly's books int the past, but Closers is too much nuts and bolts for my taste. I put down the book after 1/3 and haven't pick it up since."
4,Cold Case T.V.,After you have read all the reviews on the book...typically good...and at least the characters make reference to the T.V. series.
5,Cold cases just getting warm,As you could expect of MC this is an excellent thriller that'll keep you reading until the wee hours because it's worth it. This is the first book that I ever read that the thrilling story has nothing to do with resolving the case. That doesn't mean that the killer has never been in the story or MC just invented the end out of nowhere. The end is amazing.
4,effective tool for shop-floor implementation,"This book is layed out in a basic, easy to use format that makes it effective for shop use. I found it more appropriate than several other publications for use with my mixed management/hourly implementation team."
1,TERRIBLE,I bought this necklace and the clasp was broken. There is NO WAY to get ahold of the company except by email...which they don't answer. Total rip off!!!!! Don't buy this unless you want to throw your money out the window!
4,Pretty,I bought this for a friend as a gift. Good quality for the price. I would recommend this product to anyone
3,Picture a construction cone coated in carpet,"I could have found a cone on the side of the road and stapled a remnant to it for less than 5 bucks. I paid $17 for this thing, and it is light as a feather. I am planning on rigging it with something heavy to keep it from knocking over, but still, think twice. I got this with a gift certificate, and if it were my money, I'd want a refund. It snagged already when I was moving it around... note this was before I even introduced it to the kitty. This thing shouldn't last too long."
2,It Tips Over Too Easily,"I bought this several years ago and ended up throwing it away. My cat who, at the time, was not overweight could not use it without it tipping over which rendered this item useless. I just broke down and spent major bucks on a Drs. Foster and Smith floor-to-ceiling scratching post and fared much better. I wouldn't purchase this poorly-made product again."
3,love it.,i glad i purchased this book for my leadership class it really help me to understand the Blessing of Brokenness.
3,It was ok,The book was quite good and I liked The carakters and the plot was great but when I came to the end of the book I was sure that there was a second and maybe even more because the book didn't quite finish and I didn't get to know the caracters well enough so I wasn't satisfied with it completly. But if Ms.Dawson ever finishes Greenfire I would defenetly like to read more about Nazleen and Zaktar and people of this world.It finishes much to abruptly. If you don't mind that I would recommend it but othervise not.
2,Do Not Buy This,"I'm sure someone has made this comment before in these reviews. .... There are so many better graphics cards that are cheaper like a lower end Radeon or lower end geforce. Not only that but 3dfx went out of business, so there is not support for this product anymore. I owned a voodoo3, and now I own a voodoo5 5500. The voodoo5 [isn't good] (except if you want to play games that are supported with glide). I had a choice between that and the Geforce2, and I made the wrong decision. In summary, while this was a good card 2 years ago, it is in the computer stone age now, and the company that makes it no longer exists. I rest my case."
3,"Good, but GeForce is alot better",My friend has this card on his 800mhz and it runs great with unreal tournement and madden 2000. I got a new 1000mhz which came with the Geforce 256 and it was so much better I couldn't believe it. It was shooting out more frames a sec then the Vodoo even if i turned up my latency. I recomend both but the geforce more.
5,The best video card I have ever owned!!!!!,"I used this video card up until 2 years ago in my system running windows 98 until the market forced me to change and up-convert to windows XP, and thus having to convert over to a new video card. This was the best video card on the market at the time I bought it back in 1999/2000 and this thing rocked. I played need for speed, doom, ect...with this beast with flawless graphic details. Plus, I had radio and TV with my cable connected to the system for internet. Granted now, it looks small (16mb on board), and slow (clocked at 183mhz), but this did it all. Also captured video nicely with the special adapter line that came with it. Highly recommended for folks who still tweak with older systems."
5,Wonderful,This is a wonderful book about St. Philomena and her effect on the lives of those who call upon her. Its a wonderful down to earth read and a loving tribute.
1,non matching pair,"Can't comment on the effectiveness of how well these warm but I can comment on the quality of the detail... poor! I purchased and opened a brand new package of these (size large) and although they are both stamped L for large, one has a longer strap by about 2 inches and fits much looser than the other. It also was slightly streched around the top than the other. Very disappointed to say the least as I paid good $ plus extra for expedited shipping. The idea is great but the quality disappointed me to say the least."
4,Buy only if you are in a pinch.,My package was short a few grommet's but the ones that were there worked fine.
5,eel skin wallet trifold,"The only wallet my husband will use...small in size but plenty of room for money and credit cards without being bulky. Michelle...Scottsdale, Arizona"
4,"Elegant, but not practical","At first glance, this appears to be a very elegant wallet. It has a nice feel and texture. It is a wonderful accessory for a dress up night out. But it is not well constructed to handle the mass of material I find necessary to carry with me. Not enough room for credit cards, ID papers and I carry presciptions and other medical reference papers. I can't address the durability issue raised by other customers but it seems possible. I will probably use it on special occasions, but I need to find a nylon velcro wallet I had years ago that lasted forever. Nothing offered by Amazon fits the bill right now and don't buy the Commando wallet that comes up on a search."
5,Everyone Should See This,"Ronald Reagan is truely a Hero. He brought back optimism to a Nation that had given up hope. He brought back pride to be an American. Looking back at all he achieved is awesome and inspiring. I recommend this video to all the young people that never really knew what it was like before President Reagan gave us back our American Spirit! I remember it well and I say ""Thank You, President Reagan."" & ""God Bless You"""
3,map tangle,Wonderful idea but the map is so smelly i hate getting it out. Toxic chemical paint smell makes me nervous that the kids are playing on and around it. Still airing it out.
1,Make sure you have tools,It's a good thing I am pretty handy with tools because I had to put this thing back together after I opened it. The motor to the head was disconnected along with a tiny belt going to one of the gears. It works now but I am not sure if I would order from this brand again.
1,This broke down in the first 3 weeks of use. Bad moving mechanism for the head.,"This item broke down just after 3 weeks of usage. It uses two small o-rings as belts on the plastic pulleys that rotate the head. This is very poor quality design and also it cannot be repaired because no parts are available, the o-rings wear off in a short time, you cannot find the replacements and even if you do they are very hard to replace.Save the money on the fancy electronic movement and just buy one that moves the head with the wind.It is sure a waste of money to buy this item.To summarize, it is just a piece of crap.F.G."
2,movement sensing owl,"This seemed like a good idea. We were excited when we received it as we were getting frustrated with the pigeons roosting on our roof and the mess they make. Tom immediately bounded up the ladder to put it on our roof. Within a few days we noticed that instead of driving off the pigeons it seemed to attract them! They would come and sit right next to it like it was part of the flock! When the batteries ran out, Tom did not bound up the ladder to replace them. I have an owl whose neck swivels in the wind that does a better job. Too bad."
2,Good friend of the pigeons,"We have a family of pigeons nesting in our light-well. right next to my sick-bed. Nothing seems to faze them. We put up reflecting tape, mirror tiles, an ultrasonic pest repeller, nothing worked. So I bought the owl and put it out there in a little roof overlooking the well. First of all, the motion detector is not very effective, I hear the owl hoot only if I vigorously wave my hand within a foot of it. Also, it keeps turning its head backwards, no matter how many times I turn it forward. And the pigeons come and sing love songs to it only two feet away, and leave their droppings as tokens of their love for it. It does look impressive to us humans as well, though, so I'll just keep it out there as ornamentation."
2,Its a great lawn decoration,I'm not sure its scaring the birds at all from the high tree over my driveway. The motion detector seems to stop working after a couple minutes of first turning it on. Its also very light so it falls down with the slightest gust of wind and the head falls off. It looks really cool though and I plan to use it as lawn decor. I find hitting a snare drum does a much better job of scaring birds away.
1,Good looking bad electronics,Why pay more for this owl that should scare birds when the electronics are not worth the extra cost. Unless someone can make the sensors more accurate the birds do not start any electronic action. The look is fine and will initially spook birds. You can buy a plain cheaper owl for half the price and save your money for something else.
1,waste of money,"Never did hoot or work properlyyy...birds and rabbits ignored it. would not recommend buying, big waste of time and money"
2,Didn't really work.,"I bought this to scare the birds away from my berry trees. It didn't work. And the owl didn't either. Sure his head would spin and he would hoot but only if something was within 3 ft. of him. Lesson learned. Now, I am looking for a real owl :)"
1,Defective/ dead on arrival,"We recieved this owl and the head was stuck and didn't spin. We did get it working a few times, however it often stopped working again and has been dead for several months. Amazon is graciously processing a return. Poor quality out of the box. Fit and finish are rough and the head on our was stuck. Twisting it around got it working for a short time."
4,Amazon's helps rid bird messes,"This owl did the trick. The birds were in abundance this year and made a mess of our roof, driveway, and porch. Once they heard this owl, things changed, and our porch is now clean of bird droppings. The only problem is has is that the controller will not turn it off. It will mute, but it will not turn off so if you are having company on the porch, it will react to the people passing by as well. (I think our owl's mechanism for turning it off is broken.)"
1,Did not like,"Easy Gardener 8021 Garden Defense Electronic Sensor OwlI was totally unhappy with this product, and sent it back. After getting it to initially work when first placed outside...it would never work again. I even brought it back in the house and replaced the new batteries and it still did not work. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY & TIME HAVING TO DEAL WITH SENDING IT BACK!"
5,"AWESOME WATCH,GREAT MOVEMENT","tHIS WATCH IS QUICKLY BECOMING 1 OF MY FAVORITES,FIRST OFF I HAVE ALL KINDS OF WATCHES INCLUDING 2 CASIOS 2 LUMINOX,AND NOW 2 SEIKOS ETC,I HAVE HAD NO PROBLEM GAINING OR LOSING ANY TIME,SET IT WITH MY LUMINOX,ITS BEEN 8 DAYS AND IS PERFECT,THE GLOWING ON THIS WATCH IS GREAT AND LAST A LONG TIME,I LIKE THE ORANGE 1 WITH RUBBER BAND,BUT THATS PERSONAL PREFERENCE,OVERALL VERY HAPPY WITH THIS WATCH AND WEAR IT ARUND 6 OR 7 HOURS AFTER WORK AND POWER LAST FINE UNTIL I PUT IT BACK ON,AROUND 17 OR 18 HOURS,I HAVENT LET IT RUN OUT YET TO SEE EXACTLY HOW LONG IT LAST,MY OTHER SEIKO HAS RESERVE OF 6 MONTHS,ITS KINETIC WITH STORAGE.....FIND THAT USEFUL....THANKS..IF NOTHING ELSE ILL GET A WATCH WINDER...."
5,Best quality per dollar on the market,"I can't stop wearing this watch. To work, in the ocean, at my wedding...There is nothing I don't like about it."
5,Inspirational changes,"Free, perfect and now was a realistic account of inspirational personal and professional change. I have given the book to my entire staff which has lead our company to respond to new ideas and initiate real change."
1,Did I Really Work for this Company?,"As a former employee of Marshall Industries, I anxiously ordered my copy of Mr. Rodin's new book. I had always appreciated Rob's passion when hearing him speak a few times while at Marshall. But as I read the book, I kept asking myself, ""is this the same Marshall that I worked for?"" There is no way. I sincerely kept finding myself re-reading sections to see if perhaps I was misinterpreting some of Mr. Rodin's statements. But after studying it and speaking with former and current employees, I believe it wasn't me. This company if stiffled by people that have worked for Marshall for 12+ years and have never worked for any other companies. And if that is what they want to do, fine. Their largest supplier severed ties with Marshall, without so much as a phone call. That just shows you the respect that Marshall has in the industry. They live in their own little world. People that want to face reality and not live by cliches, just move on."
5,"""Read this book.""","""These days, lots of companies talk about change and transformation. But if you want to see what it really takes to become a fast company -- and what it really looks like -- read this book."""
5,Fascinating.....a MUST READ!,Rob Rodin was an internet visionary years before it was the flavor of the month. Anyone in a traditional business structure would do well to read this fascinating book on transforming your company to compete in todays ever changing business environment.
4,Standard English-Korean Dictionary for Foreigners: Romanized,"The book is a convenient size to carry around and contains 12,000 words so you can find much of what you are looking to say. The front and back inside covers also have quick guides to the Hangul alphabet, which is very helpful. Be aware that this book only translates from English to Korean. If you want the Korean to English translations you have to buy that edition of the book. I'm not sorry I bought it and will probably get the Korean to English version also."
1,"YES! CAN I GO now, PLEASE?",Garbage! Trash! Bullsh!+! Re+@rded! Stupid! Worthless! Useless! Only for balloon-head preteens.
4,"A pretty good capture card, but the software kind of [stinks]","I don't own one of these (yet), but I have used it for fairly intense work. Setup was a snap on my IBM Thinkpad T20. I was able to hook up an analog camcorder and capture video, without any syncing problems. The quality is pretty good, I had no problems with how it looked fullscreen (1024x768) when I captured at 640x480 (which the card doesn't actually do, it just doubled the 320x240 resolution of the video tape). The editing software is pretty horrible however. I used Adobe Premiere and it worked great."
2,What did get...??,"Has been using Dazzle digital creator for 20 days. Did I wasted money on this item??!! Unable to import MS powerpoint presentation onto dazzle unless it is converted to .AVI or .MPEG even using MS camcorder to record has been a problem. Unable to import music from the real player jukebox which came with the product. You have to input from your CD player or CDROM.. I am really to kick this to the curve unless tech support answer my email, where are they when you need them?"
4,Good headset for a good price if you take care of it!,"I found this item previously at a hardware store that was closing, so I knew what I was in for. Yes, it is not made all that well as the plastic parts can break if you are not careful, but if you do take care of this headset, it is a good value for the money spent. Also, there is good volume from the speakers, unlike other headsets I have used. It does not come with adjustable volume, but for the price, I can do without it. I bought several of these to stock up on as I go through headsets quickly."
4,On ira tous tous tous a Torre... Molinosssss!,"A must for all those looking for Belgian humor: nice songs, stupid and funny lyrics, ..."
5,Love Wigwam Ultimax,"I am a Wigwam addict. They last forever, are extremely comfortable, and I love the padded feel of the bottoms. They fit well with sneakers or regulr shoes. I buy men's even though I am a female - just for comfort and durability. I only there were more colors available."
4,Not Enough Batman,"Don't get me wrong, the story and artwork are very good, and Anarky is a very interesting ""villain"". But I wanted a little more Batman who takes a back seat in this one. That said, this book is a must for Anarky fans, and an interesting read for mature, die-hard Batman fans."
1,WHEN ANGELS CRY,"I have professionally worked as a film critic, so I know film, and let me tell you freinds: NEMESIS 4: CRY OF ANGELS is no film. Easily the worst entry in the series (which says a lot if you have seen the previous three)this movie manages to both confuse and sedate the viewer. People have fallen into comas over less than the effect of watching this wretched display of total incompetence. I would provide an overview of the plot and characters, but for the mental health and well-being of the reader I will refrain. Besides, exposure to such poison could cause more heads to explode than all of the SCANNERS films combined. Coincidentally, SCANNERS comes across as 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY when compared to this movie. Angels do indeed cry- every time a copy of NEMISIS 4 is put into a vcr."
1,you've got to be kidding!,"I have a hard time believing this is being sold as a ""book"", let alone for $32. I've read more in-depth material in a one-page column in the weekly trade rags. I returned my copy immediately."
3,Good and bad points,"First of all, I agree with the reviewer who said this sucker wasn't that easy to put together - after several frustrating attempts (the bars kept popping out of the frame), I finally glued it all together, and that did the trick. Once together, it's a really nice unit, easy to use, and huge storage capacity. However, I noticed early on that it looked like it was eventually going to collapse. I guess one could say I was overloading it, but I wasn't putting anything other than normal shoes on it, and I wasn't overpacking it. I attempted a few stopgap solutions, but finally the inevitable happened this past week. Quite the mess. And one of the stacking parts is broken right off, so it's really not repairable. I really liked the organizational benefits of the rack while it was up, so now I'm searching for something similar but a little bit sturdier."
2,DO NOT BUY,This item always collapsed and wasn't study at all. I was happy to have storage for so many shoes but it was useless because it kept falling apart.
3,Once together the product is wonderful.,"The shoe rack was not as ""easy to assemble"" as was indicated. I put it together and stacked my shoes on it and within an hour I heard a crash...it fell over. So I put it together again only this time I used a rubber mallet to ""help"" me. It is still together so either I needed the mallet to help with the assembly or I scared it into staying together."
2,"Sorry, it's too fast","Anyone who believes that Nielsen is not playing ""too fast"" needs to listen to Lamb himself on Smithsonian Folkways. This latter recording, made in 1959 when Lamb was 72 years old, exposes Neilson as a honky tonk tinkler. Nielsen comes close to getting it right on a couple of tunes (Ethiopia, Topliner Rag) but his excessive speed and heavy-handedness is no more apparent than on American Beauty Rag, a beautiful and subtle piece that is made frivolous and grating. If you want to hear Lamb's rags played correctly, go to Perfessor Bill Edward's website, where you can hear them in their entirety for free."
4,"Coherent, Readable Introduction To Religions","This was an articulate and easy to understand discourses of comparative religions with deeper insights. Provided clear summaries of religious thought, clearly intended for the lay person."
2,not the x-jet from X-MEN 2 Movie,"IF YOU ARE LOOKING OR THINK THIS IS THE X-JET FROM ""X2: X-MEN UNITED"" IT IS NOT!!!! WHEN IT WAS RECEIVED IT WAS THE CARTOON X-JET W/ THE WOLVERINE FROM THE COMICS/CARTOON SHOW.VERY DISAPOINTED AND MISLED BY AMAZON AND TRU!!!!"
1,Exercise Ball Disappointment,"Max Fitness 75cm Exercise Ball with Foot Pump (Black) was shipped to me. I opened the box and it looked like it may have been opened before now. I went ahead and took it out of the plastic and when I unfolded it, I saw a knick in the plastic material. This should not be and also there is a spot on it where it looks like it was used, deflated and then put back in the bag. I paid for a new ball but did not receive a new ball. I am going to return this for a new ball that I can inflate so I can have the same equipment that is found at physical therapy. I am disappointed with this inferior product."
2,no instructions,"Yes. I knew how to fill it with the foot pump. But how much? And there were no exercise suggestions. Never had one before. Getting a box with deflated balloon, basically."
1,Very bad experience,"Item wasn't shipped until after the original date it was supposed to be received and arrived two weeks late. Once opened, the pump included didn't even work. Upon closer inspection, the pump was sent with a shredded o-ring inside. Haven't heard back after emailing to resolve the problem yet"
5,Nice Ball,"There's really not a lot to say, it's just an exercise ball. I imagine they're all about the same and that I wasted an hour reading reviews on them, like a fool. That being said, it's everything I expected it to be and more. This has a cool look to it, it's not ugly looking like a lot of them and it holds air fine and came with all the parts. Maybe I'm nuts but I actually like the cheap little pump it came with, it worked fine and I wasn't buying a pump anyway, I was buying a ball.Pay attention to the sizing information, I ignored it, I'm 6ft. and the 75cm ball is too big for me so now I have to buy another ball. Since Max has the 65cm ball in white I'm going to buy the Tone ball so I can get blue. I did let some air out so I can work with this ball but I kind of want one that I can fully pressurize."
3,good product but...,"I like this ball now that I have it set up- it's great for stretching and even as a chair. However, when it arrived it had an oily residue all over it accompanied by a terrible chemical smell- maybe I'm just oversensitive to these things, but it was really overpowering. I washed it as best I could, and the smell has faded over time, but avoid this product if you have any sensitivity to smells or chemical.s"
3,Good ball...no plug,"I got this ball in a reasonable time to my APO address and the included pump was highly efficient as long as you use it with feet and not hands; HOWEVER comma there was no plug included, and I'm curious as to why I had to go and find a golf tee and some duck tape to ensure the air stayed in my brand new $20 exercise ball. Is this not a professional company that I purchased the ball from because my skepticism is at a concerning level."
5,Great Work Out,I bought this for my desk at work. It is the perfect height and allows me to get in sets of sit ups all day long. I may actually get rid of this gut! It's very durable. I am on it up to 8 hours a day and it is holding up well.
1,Buy the TKO,"It is not very sturdy, my boss bought the TKO brand for a few dollars cheaper and it is much more durable. This one feels like it will pop at some point."
3,Mobile Memory,"At a good price, this 2gb micro sd memory stick was just what i needed for my blackberry pearl."
1,Not for blackberries,"I purchased this item to use in a Blackberry Pearl. The Pearl would never read the media card. When contacted, ATT tech service said they were having problems with this brand, that we needed to try Sandisk, and sure enough that brand worked. I have since bought a Blackberry Curve, and it won't read this card either. I probably got a bad card, but from now on won't purchase Kingston."
2,good price but shipping takes forever,i ordered on the 31st and its is the 4th and it still is not here and it said 1 to 3 days expedited shipping this is bunk....
5,Good quality and good price,"I bought it for my T-mobile Dash, I only used it for a few days, it has worked great so far. One thing I need to point out is the label is little misleading and confusing, in Engligh, it writes ""Assemble in Japan"", but in Chinese, I happen to be a Chinese who can read Chinese, it says clearly ""Made in China"", ?!"
4,Meets All Expectations,"I bought this product for my phone. I plugged it in and it worked great, haven't had any problems with it yet."
3,"Speedy Delivery, Faulty Adapter","The shipping on this thing was amazing. I had ordered this item after another shipment, but it came weeks before the other one did. The only problem I had was that the Adapter to make it a regular SD card doesn't work. It stalls my computer, forcing me to eject it before it freezes up completely. The Micro SD card itself works beautifully. Had to get another adapter, though, which bugged me a little. I give it three stars, since the whole idea was to have that Micro SD card; the adapter was a bonus, even though it was faulty."
3,2gb not all there,this one and another one i bought dont have all the memory they say they have the sAndisk 2gb has the closest to 2gb i wouldnt recomend this one over a sandisk card.
1,Won't work with LG VX8350,"I actually tried this card twice, thinking the first card must have been defective. My phone did not recognize either card. I took the second card to the Verizon store and the tech that tried to test the card was unable to get their test equipment to recognize the card. I am very disappointed."
5,Works Great,This tiny memory card works great. I use in my Nokia n75 phone to hold pictures and music. I highly recommend it.
5,Excellent Product!,I have had this micro SD card for several months now and it has done everything that it describes it should do. I use it with my R4DS on my DS Lite and it works flawlessly. I will possibly be buying more of these or Imay be buying a 4GB Micro SD card from the same manufacturer.Kingston = cheap products and excellent quality!
5,Great memory card,Reviewing this is like reviewing a hammer....it just works and it gets the job done! :) Fast service!
5,Wonderful Memory Card for an Awesome Price,"2GB for a card that can be used in your cell phone, as well as in a digicam (because of the supplied adapter). This is a wonderful product for a wonderful value. I highly recommend it to anyone and everyone wanting to get a mini SD, or even a regular SD card!"
5,Works fine,"MicroSD card works fine in my Samsung Blast (although the phone itself has issues with the card), and the adapter works fine in my laptop."
5,Alltel - LG Scoop,"My wife and I just got LG Scoop slider phones, and I bought one of these cards for each for storing photos and music, they work great with these phones and 2GB is a ton of data for such a low price."
4,Kibby,"The memory card is nice, but the adapter is permanently on the lock position, so it is impossible to add or delete anything when you put it in the computer."
4,If Speed is Your Concern...,"I was hoping that I would get a made in Japan one, but I ended up receiving one that's made in Taiwan. I eventually got a made in Japan one from some other place. While both are fast (18.xMB/s MIT vs. 19.xMB/s MIJ) transfer speeds, this minor speed difference does make a difference for my purpose. If you know what I mean, then you're probably buying this for the same purpose. Newegg has the made in Japan ones."
5,Great Service!,Works great. Received this purchase quickly and the price was right. Thanks for the excellent service.
5,You get everything you could want!,If you are looking for a 2GB mirco SD card this is the one that you should get.It comes with everything you need for use in many different products so it makes this package even better.
4,Mini SD card with adapter,This works well for me. I keep the miniSD card in my cell phone and use the adapter to transfe pictures from my phone to my computer.
4,Kingston 2 GB,This is fully functional just make sure you do your research to make sure that its compatible with your phone/computer. It's a nifty little product and I've used two of this same brand and they both worked.
3,Getting better,"The splinter cell series on the whole has gotten a lot better with each installment. It manages to bring a little of the stealth entertainment value. But, and this is a big one, It is no Thief. Thief TMA and DS were the ultimate stealth action games. The splinter cell series has a long way to go to providing the immersive experience that haunts you for weeks afterward like thief. For those who don't believe me, get a copy of the latest (thief 3) and try the cradle level. There has been no stealth level made that will get under your skin like this.So although I applaud splinter cell for trying to further what has quickly become my favorite genre (stealth/action) they need to keep working on it."
4,Best Of The Three!,"I played and beat both of the previous two S.C. games and I have to say that this one outdoes the other two. Awesome game!!!My only gripe is that the minimum system requirements seem a bit on the low side. You need a good bit of horsepower to run this game and have it look decent.On a lighter note....to the Samewise guy...just curious, but if you didn't like the first two...why on earth would you spend another fifty dollars on the this one???"
2,Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell,Same as the first Clancy game I forgot I had not reviewed it. And like the frist I got tired of making the guy s arms and lags move. item was in good conditionccriderjohn
4,Best game of 2005,"This is the third game in the Splinter Cell series, and easily the best. Taking place in 2008, you once again play as secret agent Sam Fisher, with the task of eliminating the new threat of global information warfare.I played this on my inpiron 8600 laptop and the graphics, sound and speed are topnotch. There were some slowdowns but they were few and far between. The music really flows with the action and the detail is amazing. It is easy to see the team at ubisoft montreal took their time to perfect stealth movement and actions to make them realistic as possible.This is a game worth adding to your collection."
3,Needs a monster computer,"I did not buy this game after trying the demo. The graphics are excellent, but the system requirements are very misleading.Even on a Pentium 4 2.6 with 1GB of RAM and 5600 Geforce, with the miminal resolution, this game is SLOW. It feels like it is rendering at about 10 frames per second. Don't buy this game unless you have a computer 10x faster than the system I just mentioned. Otherwise, you will be frustrated."
5,Surprisingly useful,"It's amazing how many restaurants don't have fresh-ground pepper for breakfast eggs, or for a salad. I thought this was just a foodie joke, but it has come in useful so often that now my wife and I never go out without the pepper mill. It IS pocket sized, it fits fine in a shirt or pants pocket, and fits in any size purse."
1,Sucked,My wife bought this book. She said only a couple of the things in this book were funny. Most of them weren't funny or didn't make any sense. Returned with out a problem.
5,"Still the king, with some great support.","Nashville is good all the way through, and sometimes heartbreakingly great (Valley of Tears alone makes it a must have). Excellent support from Buddy Miller, Gillian Welch, Emmylou Harris and others. Along with Don't Give up on Me, his best late period work."
1,Disappointed,"I ordered this after reading that a critic reveiwed it as the best country album of the year. I was very disappointed. I didn't like the content at all, and the production sounded low-grade. For blues-based Americana, order MoFro instead."
5,This lion would be great as Aslan,"I read my class The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe, by C.S. Lewis every year, and this lion is perfect to play Aslan. Of course, there are lions in MANY children's books, and he'd make them all come alive. There is a Folkmanis mouse, too, so kids and teachers could act out the Aesop's fable about the Lion and the Mouse! Wonderful friend, teaching tool, reading motivator."
5,cool toy,"this toy is the best toy to come along. its so cuddly and soft. i love it. i mean, my kid brother loves it. everyone should buy this toy. its the bomb baby, the bomb!"
5,Perfect for the earthy couple,My husband and I are earth tone color people. We wanted a safari type theme even though we are having a girl. The thought of having a pink nursery made my stomach turn. This nursery set is perfect!
3,HABANA Mambo DVD,The VIDEO capture quality & the editing I geave 3 star as for the band it is to jazzy type I suspected to be more CUBAN ? CUBAN ? Like the BUENA VISTA Type if you like modern type of salsa this is for you.
1,tell the cameraman to stand still!,"love Kendall and Jen, and have enjoyed using the original Bodyshaping video, so thought this would be a good one to try. within the first few minutes had to stop the dvd because the camera was constantly bouncing, as tho the cameraman was doing the workout right along with them. unfortunatly im unable to give a review of the workout itself but it is probably good. i was quite upset at having to return this, and fortunately the place i got it allowed me a refund and i picked up a different dvd."
1,I wish I could give it zero stars,"This book is, simply put, a crime against humanity. It's very offensive. An Indian that shoots arrows while everyone else has machine guns? An Irishman that drinks and a proper British sharpshooter? The stereotyping is ridiculous.Aside from that, the writing is just terrible. There were four people credited with writing this thing and not one them said ""Wait a minute, this is terrible""?I suppose if you have no taste in literature whatsoever and like racism, this might be an okay book."
5,Last of the Three,"Please read my other 2 reviews on this story ... if you like Intrigue, mixed with history, romance and Christian reading this this series is something you are bound to like. I have to admit as I have stated over and over that I love this that Tracie does ... I have learned about railroads (that frankly I didn't think I had any interest in other than getting me from Portland, Or to Seattle, WA via Amtrak ...LOL .... but I found those 2 series so very interesting ... and I have read a few in Alaska... including some with the Gold Rush ... what great reading ... love the intrigue, although as I said I had it figured out very early in the book, but that did not lessen my interest in the books .. or my thrill in reading them. Very worthwhile reading in my opinion."
1,UNIMPRESSIVE,"Flowery, vague. Full of references, quotes and superficial historical clips. Nothing of great interet to lovers of Florence or tourists. Save you money."
4,Very slow...very mellow,"I too like most people purchased this disc after being re-introduced to The Church via Napster (imagine that). There is no real close comparison with this release to anything by The Church, nor any of his prior work. This is a very mellow, solid 14 songs release. At times the songs drag along like Magician Amongst the Spirits but overall it's more consistent than that. Sanctuary and Wreck make this release worthwhile, yet don't get this expecting Starfish or Rhyme. I would recommend his earlier CD's Rhyme & Spirit Level if your looking to expand from The Church into Marty's solo stuff. If your a big fan of his raw upbeat guitar work from earlier CD's or from The Church I would suggest his side project with the members of All About Eve called Seeing Stars (self titled). Last I heard from Marty it was set to be re-released...it's creative, upbeat & awsome! Other good side projects from The Church are SK's Slow Crack, Jack Frost's Snow Job and Peter Koppes Water Rites CD."
1,DON'T BE FOOLED BY THE ADS FOR THIS FILM,"I Rented this Film because I saw an Ad in a magazine that showed The Cover of the DVD Case with MORGAN FREEMAN Starring and saying what a Great Film it Was! THE AD AND DVD CASE IS VERY DECEIVING! This is By Far ONE OF THE WORST FILMS OF ALL TIME! First Off, if you are a Morgan Freeman Fan, please be aware that Morgan Freeman has a VERY SMALL PART and doesnt even appear until an hour into the film! This Film is so SHAMEFULLY BAD! It looks like it was shot with a Camcorder and the Editing is HORRIBLE! There are parts of the film in which the sound doesnt even match the scene! How a great actor of High Caliber such as Morgan Freeman got suckered into doing this film is beyond me. Maybe he was doing a relative or friend a favor by ""starring"" in it! The Acting is Terrible and there is NOT ONE REDEEMING QUALITY about this film! Save yourself the agonoy and the money and DO NOT BUY OR RENT THIS DVD! MORGAN FREEMAN, SHAME ON YOU!"
1,one star yeah right,"only gave one star because there was no choice for no star. i just wasted $$$ on this ..... saw morgan freemans face on cover though hey good movie. i was wrong. sadly mad movie and sadly hardly had freeman in it. very bad urban culture ""drug"" film. bad acting bad editing bad movie altoghether. dont waste your money like i did. DO NOT BUY OR RENT THIS WASTE OF TWO HOURS. and to morgan freeman i think much less of your credibility now. I dont believe i will buy anything with your face or name on it with out checking up on it from now on."
3,Good EP,"...right away i noticed that the songs on the EP were slightly softer than those of the full-length (omit permanent). They have more of an emo feel. anyway, four new songs doesn't permit a purchase in my book, bought i bought the songs via download and since then they've gotten some play on my media jukebox. Slightly different, but key for acceptance fans."
1,terrible,Will never buy Wolfgang Puck products again. This cookware was really bad. EVERYTHING stuck in them. I had to scrub and scrub everytime I used them.
4,"Beautiful music, hindered by a weak plot","Vaughan Williams himself realized that there were significant problems with the libretto for ""Hugh the Drover."" Nevertheless, that did not stop him from crafting a marvelous opera, with plenty of beautiful numbers for all involved. Bottone, Evans, and Walker all give radiant performances, and Opie and Van Allan plumb the villains' roles quite nicely, even if they are relatively thin characters.The Corydon Singers and Orchestra also perform admirably; it is to Best's credit that in the climactic fight scene at the end of Act I (Track 22), *all* the vocal lines--ten, IIRC--can be heard.A wonderful recording, and a must have for any fan of Vaughan Williams."
3,Funny and interesting but lacks punch and visuals,"It's a good movie, but it's not as exciting as advertised. It doesn't push any buttons, and it's not really sexy. It does have cool stories, but none of it feels edgy, or memorable. Too bad because I was really hyped about that movie until I watched it on Netflix. Save yourself the time, and watch Strictly Sex instead, unless you really have time to spare. In that case, make sure you watch Strictly Sex after you watch this.There's nothing unrated about it."
1,"Very few funny scenes. The acting does not look ""real."" The funniest thing is the cover of the DVD!","There are very few funny scenes. The acting does not look ""real"". Overall, it's boring. The funniest thing is the cover of the DVD!"
5,Great video!,"My 5 1/2 month old son loves this video. Of the three we have, the baby and I by far enjoy this one the most. It is always set in the VCR prepared for cranky time to settle him down. It is the perfect 30 minute babysitter so I can get some stuff done. Of the three-Mozart, Bach, and Einstein (I have not seen Shakespeare yet)- Mozart is by far the best. If you are a consumer trying to decide which one to buy, the decision has been made. Buy this one!"
5,Top of the line in educating young children,"We recently switched from watching the Baby Einstein video everyday to the Baby Mozart video. My 15 month old son, Eric loves it. In fact, when he is ready for a nap, he points to the television and says ""vee-oh"" to remind me to put in his favorite video ( Baby Mozart). We have had such fun watching and using your products. We are eagerly awaiting the delivery of the Baby Shakespeare video and the Baby Webster flash cards that I just ordered from your online store. Because Eric is taking in everything I can teach him, I am thankful for the additional tools that provided through the Baby Einstein Company."
5,I don't get it!,"My three month old is awed by this video and i just don't know how. It consists of soft music and moving pictures. It is very boring for a parent to watch, but somehow it entertains baby for almost the entire duration. My daughter loves the watch television and i would rather have her watch something like this and hear the classical music than to watch something else. The part with the barking dogs and animals came out of nowhere and may be a little scary to the younger babies, and moms who aren't expecting it like myself. Definitly a good buy to buy yourself time to make dinner or read a magazine."
5,Baby Mozart,"This was a gift that Mom loved, most important Mom thought this was educational not just a babysitter. The 3 month old baby also loved it"
4,Entertaining,"My daughter LOVES the Baby Einstein Beethoven, so we thought we would try this one and while she does enjoy it, it doesn't hold her attention the same as the other one."
5,Our Six-WEEK old LOVES this video,"Throughout my wife's pregnancy, we listended to Mozart. We are not classical music fans. But, we found that we enjoyed it. When our baby was born, someone gave us this video. Needless to say, we thought that we needed to wait several months before trying it. But, one night our daughter was colicky and completely inconsoleable. So we tried everything; why not the video. Well, it instantly soothed our baby. She loves the rythyms and we can see her eyes following all of the action on the screen."
1,Very insipid,I bought this and the baby einstein dvd for my kid and have been observing him. He is totally bored after a few minutes. I loaned it to a few friends hoping their kids might react differently. Nope. They are very bored as well.This might be a good one for a child less than 6 months old (not for toddlers).
5,Excellent!...well-written...it made sense,"This book, I'm telling you can't put it down until your finsish. When I first read this book, I have read all her other books and I'm waiting for the new one ""Easier to Kill"". Valerie is one of my favorite Afro-American authors. Other books/authors I recommend is Omar Tyree and Yolandoe Joe."
3,Pretty decent.,"I used this book for my introduction to electronics class.It was pretty good, but sometimes the explanations were a bit fuzzy.It's not a horrible book, but it's now a good bit out-of-date."
4,a good glance at Mogwai,"I think this is the most accessible Mogwai record to anyone.It is balanced with beautiful singing, nice tunes, atmospeherics, experimentation and offers classic Mogwai slow-build guitar playing.On the other hand, it may appear that Mogwai are going more into a mainstream direction at this point, having as a guest on track 4 the singer from Super Furry Animals.Overall the album works because there is something from everyone.Additionally, despite the fact that there is not much ""rock"" in this album, I recommend the album just for track 5 ""You don't know jesus"". This is one of the most powerful tracks ever done by any rock band."
4,Keep on Walkin,My Favorite Club/Pop song of all time and thats not the only song on this Cd good songs up tempo beats is the story of this album if you like early 90 club music get this!
4,Nice Package,"I bought the CD today and I love it because it has a nice blend of slow jamz and uptempo numbers. She is a house diva! So many house/R&B singers have tried to copy here to no success. I'd say she is a modern day Shannon (the girl who sang ""Let The Music Play"") because she created a sound that was unique and other wannabes hopped on board. I enjoy it very much and it is shame that Ms. Peniston is no longer on the charts. But I'll always remember growing up with her music and I think that matters more than being #1 all the time and coming out with unmemorable crap."
3,size,These are beautiful but closer to a dinner sized plate than salad plate. This Evening Sun line is far below the usual quality of Pfaltzgraff. It chips easily!
3,A Quiet Man,"The surprise ending saved this movie from receiving a two from me. Christian Slater stars as a pathetic worker in a cubicle who ends up being a hero after saving others from a workplace shooting. A girl who is shot and ends up quadraplegic becomes his friend. The movie drags in spots and is deliberately confusing in others. While there is some style to it, there is a lack of style in many of the scenes. I listened to the director's commentary for more insight but found someone who overestimated their achievement and had quite an inflated ego. I'm glad I didn't see this one in the movie theatre."
5,AWESOME book on vegetable gardening,I've learned so much from this book so far. Lots of nice photos and detailed descriptions of each type of vegetable. I've learned a lot that I didn't already know. I highly recommend this book to anyone who is serious about vegetable gardening.
5,Makes You Think...,"The first time I watched this film on Netflix I gave it 4 stars. I found myself coming back to this film and watching it again. After I watched it 3 times i gave it 5 stars.Things are not always what they seem....The things you do wrong in your life...all of us....it affects you for the rest of your life...This fantastic film that shows the immense guilt and sadness of one man and how it devastated his whole life. I'm not terribly religious, but this man, he found his salvation and in the end forgiveness. He did many good things in his later life, but these things could not heal him until he was forgiven in the end.There are many fine moments in this film some of which you may not understand in the first viewing."
3,Nice But Predictable,"The few Russian movies I have seen tend to telegraph the major story arc far in advance. This one has a confrontation in the first five minutes that is clearly not final. Yet it molds and shapes the main character's life in the worst kind of way. It would seem a monk who is not able to accept forgiveness over 30 years may have wasted everyone's time. The ""I am not worthy to be among the other monks"" mantra strikes me as a tremendous lack of faith."
5,Thought-Provoking and Illuminating,"""That's What the Man Said"" presents the essence of fifteen of Christ's teachings in a a clear and concise manner. Mr. Dunnam illustrates these lessons with real life scenarios that touch the heart and core of his readers. The result is a fascinating study that leads the reader down the path to comprehension and a spiritual awareness of what being a Christian means in our daily lives. Each chapter is accompanied by thought-provoking exercises drawing the lessons around us, prompting sustained conscious actions rather than spontaneous reactions.A thoroughly enjoyable working book."
1,Deceptive packaging,"I paid more $$ to get a Japanese card with a guaranteed speed rating, good brand name, etc. This is an excellent price for a 256MB card, but buyer beware: even though the company is Japanese, the packaging clearly says ""Made in Taiwan"" on the reverse. Even worse, once you crack open the seal, the card itself is not made in Japan or Taiwan, but in mainland China. According to multiple sources, SD cards made in China have the worst quality control and are unpredictable often resulting in loss of data or formatting. Better to skip this card unless Amazon or their subcontractors guarantee a card made in Japan or at least Taiwan."
2,Cartoon that time forgot- because its sucks...lol..,Im sorry I got this dvd....not the cartoons i really wanted. Not the sellers fault...Although a complete list of cartoon in description would have been a bonus!
3,Forgotten Cartoons,We gave this DVD to our 46 year old son for Christmas per his request.I'm sure he'll enjoy hours of enjoyment from these forgotten cartoons. This will be added to his DVD library of old cartoons.
1,(mumbles...) (mumbles...) (mumbles...),"When I first picked this up back in 2003 when 50 Cent was hot, I was thinking highly. I mean, a full-blown documentary, music videos, new songs and sessions@aol at my disposal. Once I saw the documentary, all I have to say is that I cant understand a damn thing that 50 Cent is saying. He cant speak English to save his life, and that destroyed everything because I couldn't hear a f***ing thing that he was talking about. As for the music videos, it was 50 Cent walking around with his ho's with his muscle shirt and his 9's with his g-unit gangstaz. The sessions@aol was a joke. The extra tracks sucked. All in all, a huge waste of money. So, it is used rehularly as a coaster."
2,Crap?,"Ok where to start? First off rappers need to leave the dvd scene alone, stick to music. This dvd is just hyped up. I could really care less if 50 cent got shot 9 times, big deal. All these suburban kids eat this stuff up because they want a taste of the ""street life"". I'll give 50 cent props because he is a decent artist, but he's no tupac. I don't see wasting money to see behind the scenes footage of 50 cent concerts and so on and so forth. And half the reviews i read on this dvd were just kids saying how much they love 50 cent. I suppose if you are a die hard 50 cent fan then you could waste your money on this but i wouldnt pay to see it myself."
4,in need of tracks for 5o cents album called: the new breed,"i enjoy 5o cent i think he is very cool and his music is really meaningful, wish i could get the tracks for the new breed, can't find them anywhere, if anyone can help me i'd surely be grateful."
2,MEXICAN SLANG: A GUIDE,"Disappointed in the book. It appears to be a home-made, unprofessional notebook which was typed similar in appearance to a rent receipt booklet. The terms are okay, but the book is simply too small and not worth the price. I'd recommend adding a few bucks and buying a proper book. It isn't a coincidence that the photo of the book is not shown."
2,Snooze,"Be warned. Despite South's outstanding musicianship and tremendous self-assurance, this album is so mellow that it might put you to sleep. South is being favorably compared to Coldplay, whose ""Parachutes"" album was favorably compared to Oasis, which seems more three sheets to the wind these days. But South is way off the map of rock; it's not trance-rock, it's sleep-rock. I think the litmus test for whether you like ""From Here On In"" is Radiohead's ""Kid A"" album; if you're impressed with ""Kid A,"" you might well like South. For me this stuff is annoying beyond belief."
5,Mighty Good Rock!,"Mic and the boys get better with each album. This one immediately established five new songs in my ""Favorite Mic songs"" playlist: Mighty Good Wine, Hey Driver, Mandie Mcmanus, The Only Road, and Wiser the Whiskey."
3,"AKA ""Blowin' Smoke""","This film is also available as ""Blowin' Smoke"" so visit that page on amazon.com to read reviews and comments, etc."
5,cat scratch fever,"I bought this sisal rope cat scratching post, even after reading that it tips over and is light wieght...and i am so glad i did! MY CAT LOVES IT! I had no problem keeping him off the couch after buying this. It IS lightwieght so i took a 2 lb. dumbell and it fits inside perfectly and gives it the wieght it needs. There is something about the rope that makes the kittys go crazy. He actually runs to it when i come home so he will start scratching and then expects me to pet him while he scratches and flips around...its a routine now. Anyway, i took the 2 lb. dumbell after turning the post upside down, and placed it in as far as it would got horizontally. Worked perfect for wieghing it down. My cat is a kitten but will be big soon and a big cat would scratch one time and knock it over...i have just never seen a cat go nuts over a post like this one.!!!"
5,PERFECT!,"The item was exactly as shown and described. The price was right, the shipping was fast and the overall buying experience was perfect! Thank you"
5,"Vittles Vault ""Jr""",This is a nice small container. It is a great size for traveling and provides protection against ants.
3,Don't Waste Your Money or Time,"This book was a nice fantasy read, about the so-called thrill-seeking gene and the Kennedy Curse, but I don't see how anyone could take it seriously. ..."
5,Super book for 2 to 5 y.o.,My son 2 y.o. loved it. Carries a book with him everywhere. Buy!!! A very good book. Super cover and content. We are from Belarus-learn english :)
5,TI is always great,"I had used a TI-83 calculator for collage, and then when I took calculus I was required to purchase a new calculator. The one I chose was the TI-86 because I liked the TIs so much. . A choice that I have not regretted since purchasing it in 1999. It is very well built, the features are clear and easy to learn and even after being dropped more than its fare share, this calculator for the last year has worked flawlessly. I would recommend this calculator to anyone that needs a calculator that can handle calculus."
5,A Great Calculator!,"The Ti-86 is a great calculator to have! It's got really powerful functions at a great price. It doesn't have Flash memory like the 83 Plus or silver edition but the 86 doesn't really need it! The 83 plus and silver edition aren't really useful for advanced math and science classes in high school so they,re just a big waste of money. But the 86 is can easily handle those subjects! Overally the Ti-86 is a great calculator!"
5,TI-86,this calculater is pretty cool it can do an awful lot of things that a 10 dollar calculator can not but if you dont need it dont waste the money
5,"You got to know whats up ( From a programmer, I know. )","I used to have a ti-83, and a ti-83+, but the 86 is the best of the three. I am real into programming the calculator. The 86 can have variables and Lbl's with up to 8 charectors, opposed to 2 for the 83, 83+. It can store almost unlimited amount of pics, unlike the 83,83+, which can only store 10. The calculator also does conversions. Everything from temp to energy to power, making it save all that time on tests and homework. I read another review that said it could not do absolute value(which is called abs), and convert fractions to decimals(>frac, and >dec), but it can. They aren't under a bunch of subfolders either, because you can easily create your own custom menu to paste anything you want on the screen. This way is even faster. It also comes with an excellent instructional manual. By far the best choice between 83, 83+, and 86."
4,Good for the price,"I have only used the TI-83 before purchasing the TI-86.From the few weeks that I have used this calculator, it has saved me a lot of time and effort. The biggest time saving thing on it is the solver and the simultaneous equation solver. What would take me tons of time and an entire page of writing, solving for 3 or even 4 unknowns, now just takes a few seconds. All I have to do is put it in and hit solve!Also, the vector function of this calculator is nice for my Calc III, statics, and Physics classes. It comes most handy when working in 3D. However, the interface is hard to work with and can take too much time. They should come up with a faster and easier to use menu to edit, enter, and use vectors.Other than these things, it does everything the TI-83 does without any trouble. It is a good scientific calculator, as long as your teacher allows it to be used!I am glad I made this purchase."
2,THIS IS BASICALLY AN ADVERTISEMENT FOR A BOOK,"While this DVD does have some B&W; footage of Pistol Pete, it is limited. I guess I shouldn't have been surprisedwhen it clocks in at 65 min. A good deal of the disc is the author talking to another guy about Pete. The footagethey have obtained isn't the most flattering, though on occasion you do see glimpses of his star power. I hopeone day we can really have a decent video of the Pistol."
3,Pistol Pete in College,"This appears to be a one hour television special with an interview of Mark Kriegel, who wrote a biography of Pete Maravich. Interspersed throughout the interview is B&W footage of his LSU games, including a few shots of his freshman year that I haven't seen anywhere else. The ""bonus"" feature is the second half of the Kentucky at LSU game of his senior year. It is disappointing in that the camera shots are long-range and there is no sound. Without commentary, it's sometimes hard to tell Pete from his teammates. Since the game was televised by CBS, I wish they had included that telecast with commentary. Maybe somebody will someday. If you're looking for your first ""Pistol"" DVD, I recommend ""The Night of Pistol Pete"" which covers his best game as a pro."
4,Foundations of Chinese Medicine,Product in good condition. Quick and easy company to deal with. Great savings!Delivery was slack. Delivered 5 days after the last dilervy date specified and left on door step in a dodgy neighbourhood without even knocking to see if I was home. Not good when you purchase a $300AU book
4,Very Good fin de scicle chamber music.,"For the musical omnivore who searches all the different corners of musical genres to see what there is to hear, these pieces are not as great on the ear as works from the contemporary 'greats' such as Wagner and Strauss, but they are very nice indeed, and have an amazing ring of modernity about them. I'm especially intranced by the combination of instruments, as the 20th century seemed to have forgotten how to write for the Organ. I'm also interested in contrasting these works to those of Busoni, Kurt Weill's mentor. Both have hints of early 20th century theatrical music, but here, the hints are faint. The only thing which distresses me about this CD from Amazon is the very high price. If you can get it for under its original list price of about 18 dollars, it's a bargain. For 85 bucks, one can get five or six excellent CD's from this period."
4,The Return of Jas. Hook,"Nicely presented CD of lesser-known English classical music, which is especially valuable for bringing unjustly neglected composer James Hook (from my home town of Norwich) back into the public eye. Very much in the style of Haydn with a 'folk-music' edge to it, Hook's Clarinet concerto is sure to delight."
2,Not What I Expected,"Having bought so many of the other Baby Einstein DVDs, I couldn't wait to watch this one with my 18 month old son. We were both very disappointed. My son could not ""get into"" this one. It is the only one in the series that he hasn't liked so far. I believe it may be that the visuals just don't match well with the music, and the whole dvd is quite dull."
3,"Another hit from Baby Einstein, but...","While my 11 month old daughter has enjoyed many of the offerings from Baby Einstein, this particular DVD has not 'wowed' her as much as some of the others have done. The music, as usual, is pleasant and enjoyable (I personally am a fan of Bach) and the visual aspects appealing, but she has responded with more enthusiasm to Baby Van Gogh and Baby Mozart, quite honestly. We will keep this in our library of 'baby friendly' videos, without question, but would probably reach for a more 'tried and true' favorite first before Baby Bach."
3,Acceptable if annoying,"While our 16 month old enjoys this video as much as Baby Mozart and has done so for the past four months it definitely has deficiencies. My principal objection is to the static shots of various musical instruments accompanied by snatches of music that could not have possibly issued from those pictured. To my mind it would have been more interesting to show individuals playing those instruments. There is a certain lifelessness to the video as a whole increased by an echo chamber quality in some of the music and voices. Still, there just aren't that many videos out there for kids that can't yet talk so I don't want to be overly critical. As far as the frequent footage of producer's daughters...well it certainly provides us parents with a warning that what we may find simply adorable in our children just might be grating to others. From now on I vow to limit the number of baby photos I carry and the footage of home movies I show should I ever purchase a camcorder."
1,Blech!,"I *love* Bach and the music selection for this video is hardly any of the best stuff he composed and so dumbed-down that it's downright bad (maybe it's not dumbed-down and the people who arranged it had a different idea for the figured-bass than most others have seen it but it still isn't appeasing to the ears). Also, like I've said in all my reviews of the composer vids, the timing is off for the vid portion and in a Bach video that's just not good. The Mozart vid is far better music wise but I suggest buying the c.d.s and forgoing the vids for this collection altogether."
3,Baby movies,"I watched this dvd with my 11 month old. It was ok, but she didn't seem as interested in it as the other Baby Einstein movies that we have. It just didn't grab her attention like some of the others."
2,Too Amateur,I received this video as a gift for my son at birth and was grossly disappointed. The quality of the video was such that I could've taken my own camera and videod his toys to music. I suppose I was expecting more...I'll try Baby Mozart.
1,Quality is missing - Skip this one,I like and own other Baby Einstein DVDs. The quality of production is missing in Baby Bach. The segments do not seem themed (as in the other DVDs). In fact it is annoying random as if it was just slapped together. There is too much of a reliance on still shots rather than moving ones that work with the music.And her kids are annoying at this point. I got the feeling they were being marketed to us as Adorable Kids. Too much.
5,Baby Bach,"My wife and I are parents of 6 1/2 month old twins. We have found Baby Bach and Baby Mozart to be wonderful in helping calm the kids down, and capturing their attention. They delight in the images, often giggling with joy. We highly recommend them to all our friends and aquaintances who have just had children!"
4,Baby Bach,"We bought this video and all of the other Baby Einstein DVDs when out daughter was about 2 months old. She absolutely loves Baby Bach. She's 10 months now and it is harder to hold her attention. But for the past 8 months, if we played that DVD, she'd stop what she was doing and be glued to the video. She becomes bored with the still pictures of the toys and the children playing. She loves the music of Bach. We purchased Baby Beethoven also, but Baby Bach is still her favorite. We're starting on all the other videos now, she really likes the puppets. We purchased those for her, they are a little disappointing compared to the fancier ones in the video, but she likes them anyway. Baby Einstein is a good purchase. I highly recommend the DVDs."
3,What???,"As soon as I flip through the book and saw all those blank pages, making the story less than the 194 pages I thought it was, I was disappointed.It took me a quick three hours to read this. The story itself had potential, the drama factor was there, but was lacking substance.And as for reality...who on earth would open their back door to someone who was being chased by police cars and helicopters?? The characters were underdeveloped, and there were too many unanswered questions. I was pissed when I got to the end and realized the authors left the story hanging...what was that all about? I would like to have a word with these authors to find out their reasoning behind this!Now, with two powerhouses like 50 cent and Nikki Turner I expected much, much more than this! These two are excellent in their respected crafts but together...I'd have to say two thumbs down on this one!LocksieARC Book Club Inc."
4,Interesting but its time for a change....,"The urban fiction genre is becoming redundant--Like why does every chick have to own a hair salon and why does every dude gotta hustle? I don't know, maybe its me...I give this book 4 stars because the story line was good and there was a lot of plot twists that kept it interesting...However I couldn't feel how Sunni flipped from money over men to running bath water and catering to Trill so easily--They could have built that up some because she seemed like a totally different character....This book defiinitely leaves you hanging and there are a lot of issues left open...Hopefully there will be a sequel"
5,Excellent work,"Just discovered the works of Shirley Jackson, although I'd been familiar with The Lottery since high school. Awesome, totally original writer. I will never tire of reading the first paragraph of ""The Haunting of Hill House."" The sheer skillful power of her writing ... as Stephen King wrote, she never had to raise her voice. Dug out a short, unsatisfying bio of Ms. Jackson by some German academic, then discovered Ms. Oppenheimer's work. A terrific biography, reads like a great story should. I can empathize somewhat with the Jackson offspring, since I, too, had a mother who was a writer and a giant personality and an overindulger in food and drink. But my mother cleaned up her health and lived till age 77 while Ms. Jackson's overworked heart gave out at age 49, truly a shame."
5,Unbelievable... fantastic,"Tad Hendrickson left only one thing out of his review. Yerba Buena is the S---!! Normally I try to present some sort of reasoned analysis in a review, but this album simply defies reason. Hits as hard as a Mack truck is right. It's the best thing I've heard in years."
3,Opera (Eye Witness Companion),"A Well written book. It had more prose about opera history and theory (well written) than I expected and shorter synopses (almost too brief) than I had hoped,"
3,Only for small fishing rods,"I bought this expecting to be able to store my 6' 6"" medium action (2 piece) rod. The tube inside the case is so small the bottom guide won't fit inside the tube. My light and ultra light rods fit, so all is not lost, but I am disappointed a standard medium rod is a no go. The inside diameter of the rod tube is approximately 2""."
2,Dull,"The previous reviewer was right about Faure's piano music being of ""introspective moods, rich chromatic textures, subtle expressivity and sheer tonal beauty"", however, I heard very little of that in Stott's playing.If lifelessness is what equates introspection for the critics that praised these recordings, then Stott's Faure deserves every award it's gotten. The fact is, her playing seriously lacks the ""chromatic textures, subtle expressivity and sheer tonal beauty"" that is so important for Faure, and the only reason these recordings are so highly praised is because of patriotic bias. Even the Naxos bargain offerings by Volondat is much better."
4,Great Sunday afternoon read,"I came to this book having read The Great Montana Cowboy Auction by Anne McAllister. I loved it - I read both books in one afternoon. The review below from word.weaving describes the plots surperbly so I won't repeat any of the stories. But you will be swept away by it all and personally, I can't wait to catch that flight to Jackson!"
5,Great!,Keep the cable close to the walls whether going up/down/left/right. Just what I was looking for. Prompt shipping and great price.
5,good purchase,the 90 degree coaxial connector worked perfectly for slim wall mount of led tv. channels cable nicely with no kink in the cable. works perfectly.
4,Coaxial Adapter,"perfect for wall mounted flat screen televisions,enables getting the cables closer to the set and really hug the wall when usingthe swivel wall mounts."
1,Broke right away,Felt solid when I received it but it didn't even last a whole day. The internals broke loose after a few hours with no abuse.Do not buy.
3,"Good Intent, average result.","With certainly good intent, this CD falls a bit flat: for instance, the Concerto for Piano and Strings doesn't compare to the gripping quality of Postnikova/Rozhdentvensky Erato version re-released on Apex, still the best recording of that piece. The orchestra is clumsy compared to that version and to that with Yuri Nikolaevsky conducting in Ponomareva version available on amazon canada.The Bosch piece are a nice addition and the other better known pieces are better handled on other recordings imo."
2,Egocentric,"First of all, I highly commend Mr. Piburn for having the courage to write his story. Although, the further I got into the book, the more egocentric his style of writing became. I felt like many times he was focusing more on how to say things than sharing what was really going on. When I arrived at the part in the book where he expresses that a man has to ejaculate sometimes, I could no longer read this. It sounded chauvinistic to me. As a female partner of someone with chronic pain, I can only say that I'm sure both sexes have a need to experience the release of orgasm. Maybe the book would be more helpful to a male who is the well spouse."
1,Shipping mistakes,Never received the item. Shipping and billing address are different and the system cannot handle processing.Very poor operation and will not use this seller again.
4,A Mellow Groove With the Essence of Morocco,"This cd took me quite by surprise when I first played it. I first heard of Imhotep from Cheb Mami song ""Parisian du Nord"". Upon further investigation found out about Iam. Since I love MC Solaar I thought I give this one a try. It isn't a hip-hop cd and goes along more with the likes of Digital Bled. Atmospheric grooves blended with the music and sounds of North Africa. It's sweet Cd that will remind one of a quiet Moroccan night whether it be in the desert or in a small coastal town."
5,"Good, only if taking higher lvl math classes","This calc is really useful when you're taking higher level maths (above Calculus 1,2,or 3) or higher level physics. Certainly this calc is of great help in Calculus, but only as a checking tool. Once your derivatives are a little too complex to integrate or analyze in certain intervals, it sure comes in handy. I don't reccomend it if you're taking college algebra or something similar."
5,great calculator.. but..,"no LOG button! which means no antilog, which you need in algebra 2 and chemistry! (unless of course im being extremely stupid and dont know how to do antilog). anyway. its annoying to scroll through the catalog or type log each time. also not a good calculator for stats (if you are using the workshop stats book), unless you are lucky enough to find all of the programs you need. i love this calculator. its quite easy to use.. not confusing at all. you just have to get sed to it. the 'window"" is great, makes everything a lot simpler. the text display is much better than the ti-83. super! Also, most teachers do not know how to use a Ti-89, so if you have issues with it, its basically your problem and you need to figure it out. Overall, GREAT calculator because its easy to use and has most of the functions i regularly use.."
1,"WOW, an expensive load of garbage","I bought this like 3-4 years ago and have hardly used it, and it worked great when I needed it, but just recently 1 day suddenly entire rows of pixels started dying on me (literally they started vanishing in front of me). The bottom most row where u enter data is fine, but several rows above it have died. I contacted TI and those thugs ask for 81 bucks for repair or replacement with a reconditioned model. Heck I'd much rather spend 81 bucks and buy some other companies product. Never going back again to TI's garbage again unless I need it for some course of mine. If I can find some alternate I'll definitely take that."
5,Love it but can't use it on all tests,"I love the TI-89, use it all the time and used it on the FE (fundamentals of engineering) exam this past spring. New regulations were just made that prohibit the use of the TI-89 and many other advanced calculators like this one on the FE and the PE exams starting with the Spring 2004 tests.If the main reason you are buying it is to take it into an exam, check if it is allowed before you waste all the money."
4,More than you need,"I'm goin to keep this short. Basically if your in high school, this calculator is more than you need. Im in college algebra in 10th grade and I'm not allowed to use it in class. The TI-89 contains a computer algebra system where you don't have to do any of the work. You just press the ""solve("" key, type in the problem then "",x"" or whatever other variable your working with and it does the whole problem for you. This is the same as cheating because it doesn't show the work just gives the answer. That's why its not allowed in most high school math classes. Also, the TI-89 is not allowed on the ACT so don't just buy it so you can cheat to get a good score. Ok i'm bein a little unfair. The TI-89 is an excellent calculator, one of the best i've ever seen. I just recommend it for 12th grade and up."
1,Misinformation,"I bought this used calculator for my daughter. The seller said it worked perfectly. It doesn't. Some screens are unreadable. Unfortunately I had to teach out of town and when I came back and discovered the problem and wrote to the seller, I was informed that my 14 days were up and therefore had no right to a refund. That's it. I would not buy from this seller again and do not advise anyone to do so. Misinformation should not have a time limit. That is dishonesty.This is the second time I have a problem with a merchandise sold through Amazon.Disappointed."
5,One of the best calculators ever made,"I recently bought the TI-89 and it's the most awesome one that I've ever had. There's SO much you can do with it. It has all the powers of the TI-92 except the keyboard and is handy too. It has much better games and better graphics than TI-83. For math students, it can solve equations,factorize and much more. It sure is a must-have for every-one."
5,Prestige Calculator For High School And College Use.,"I just recently bought the TI-89, and I was amazed by it's power, and capability's. My father thought the TI-89 wouldn't inprove my math grades, but ever since I got the TI-89 I haven't gotten any thing lower than an A. Meaning that I only get A's on my math tests, and quiz's, and my report card grade is also an A. The TI-89 is truely a must have instrument. I am far ahead of my class mates with this calculator. Every parent which wants there child to succeed in any math cource should definitely purchase this calculator for there child. My dad was a non believer in this calculator, but now he regrets not getting me the calculator sooner. This is truely some thing that you should not miss out on, and you will not regret purchasing this calculator."
2,Great item but was filthy when received.,"Item was as described however it was filthy, dust and dirt was all over the calculator and took a bit to get it cleaned up. Also, it had leaking batteries still in the device. Will not buy from this seller again."
5,German Musik,I loved this CD because it is in German. Musik from my youth. It was perfect I wish that I could find more without buying from overseas.
4,Great for the price,"not much to say here, for under $20 it is a decent ashtray. I haven't scratched mine, but I can see how that could happen. if you want something elegant, be prepared to spend some money, otherwise this works just fine and looks good. not a very large bowl though."
3,The Crystal Bible,"I purchased this book the same time i purchased ""The Book of Stones."" It has been a great guide to help with things that are not in the the other book. It is good when used in conjunction with The Book of Stones. Alone this book doesn't have the same impact as if used together. But it is a great little guide when you can't keep the bigger book around. I give this book 1 Thumb up."
5,EXCELLENT AND THOROUGH,I have several books on crystals but few contain the quality and quantity of information that Judy Hall does. Her pictures have helped me put names to stones I had given up hope on. A must have book for all crystal collectors
3,Just okay..,"Missing a lot of gemstones and definitions aren't that great. It's an okay book for beginners but will quickly grow out of it. If you are looking for indepth information, this is not the one."
5,Stunning for Christmas and beyond,"I am trying to put this CD away, as Christmas is past. However, I keep listening ""just one more time"". Under the direction of Stephen Layton, Polyphony is perfection. The carols from 19th and 20th century British composers are uniquely beautiful. This is a perfect example of the British choral art."
2,"Amazon needs to work on what ""fits""","Low rating due to Amazon, not the item itself.This is for a base model Sentra. What Amazon fails to recognize is that this WILL NOT fit the SE-R or SE-R Spec V, or any other model that has the factory strut bar. If you have a strut bar this item WILL NOT FIT."
