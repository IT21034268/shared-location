4,WHAT DRIVES YOU?,"I got this game for Christmas,and it is awesome.Great graphics.The ""In The Zone"" feature is great.The car takes damage easily but is still cool.So if anyone likes racing get this game,It totaly ROCKS!"
1,Why No Replacement Cover?,"Why would Aero Beds, a reputable company that makes high-quality products, market an expensive dog bed with no opportunity to purchase a replacement cover for the bed??? What a waste of the consumers' money and our natural resources. While we are washing and drying the cover, the bed is unusable. When the cover wears out or is destroyed, we have to throw out the plastic, inflatable bed and the electric pump. We've tried to contact Aero about this problem, but can't reach anyone but Customer Service, which states categorically that replacement covers are not available. Too bad! Our dogs think the bed is great."
4,comfy dog,"I bought this for my doxie who was having back problems. Thankfully she is better now, but all 3 of my dogs like this bed. I like the removable cover that goes right into the washer too. I do not put the cover in the dryer and so it does not shrink."
4,Excellent Song Writing and Guitar Work,"This CD stands right up there with the best artists in my collection. If you don't know these guys, you should. They offer up compelling lyrics and great guitar work that spans a variety of styles. It ranges from a homey Colorado accoustic style to a funky danceable sound that gets you up and going. All through the melodies are lyric and the guitar work is something that musicians will appreciate!If you haven't heard them yet, take a listen. Then keep your eyes out for more from this leading Colorado band."
5,Great album for easy listening music.,"I'm a big fan of light house family. This album is a ""Must have"" for their fan because they are not in the same band anymore. I can listen to this album over&over, never get tired. Most lyrics are so meaningful & romantic. I wish they may make a band together again, good Duo."
2,Blegh,"I expected more out of this book. It is very well written in that it is to the point and witty. However, I paid $[money] for alot of information that I already knew, and could find on the internet for free. Infact most of the sites the author gives you in the book are more informative than the actual text. I don't recomend this book unless your completely new to this type of lifestyle, then I would say it is a definate read."
4,Happy Day !,"Before reading this book, I thought my embarrasing problem would not go away. Then I tried a technique described and ended up having the best night of sex in the world. Not all information in the book will be useful to everyone, but it is definately worth looking at."
2,Will the real Dan Simmons please stand up.,"Up until this book I would have said no one can do it better than Mr. Simmons, and what a pleasure it was to discover this book on the shelves.Hmmm.In a nutshell, DB tells of a massive conspiracy to, yawn, rip off, the insurance industry, yawn, with our intrepid accident assesment..Well who cares. Look above for plot. Suffice to say this is a sloppy book, rife with fact-checked mistakes (Chapel Hill, South Carolina?) that seems, for all the world, more like an adaptation of a screenplay that didn't sell than a well-crafted novel by a Master."
1,"Good start, but downhill from there","It started off good and interesting and exciting, but then just kind of dwindled off. All the military and mathematical talk was a serious snorefest, and the way Darwin and Syd's relationship finally develops is just totally anti-climatic and disappointing."
4,A very entertaining read,"This is the best of Simmons books I have read including olympos and the hyperion series for pure entertainment, character development and interest. The story is about an accident investigator who is caught up in an insurance fraud scheme. That gives Simons the backdrop to tell a very entertaining tale in the form of a detective mistery.The characters here are just deep enough to be interesting without going into deep background that would bog down a story that runs at such a fast clip.Like all of the Simons books I have read so far, the book just kind of ends with simple resolutions, the guy gets girl, the bad guy dies, and we all go off in the sunset together.Simons is one of the most accmplished authors we have winning awards in Sci Fi, Horror, and now this first rate detective novel. Overall good show and it makes me want to buy ""the Crook Factory"" another in this genrea."
1,An evolutionary dead end ..,"Although Mr. Simmons presents an interesting plot idea in this crime/thriller, missing are his stylistic fingerprints and fully developed characters.As an avid reader of his work, whatever the genre, I was very disapointed by Darwin's Blade. The story is very linear, lacking the complex, converging plot threads that make his other novels so gripping. In truth, I struggled through many of the revelatory passages where the hero's past was explained and which, quite coincidentally, suited him exactly to combat the current situation. By the end of the book the abilities of the hero, rather awkwardly named ""Darwin Minor"", make the characters who inhabit the worlds of Clive Cussler and Tom Clancy look very unambitious."
4,pet dish,"got this to replace one that broke. The depth is a bit more than I expected, over an inch and a quarter deep, but does the job great. I got it for a dual purpose, out-of-doors feeding mealworms to ""bluebirds"" however the depth make it not where the fledging's can get the worms. The house pets luv it however !!! Is capacity is what was needed in here long ago. The weight makes it so it does not move around too much. I like the colors and that is why I bought 2. Good addition to feeding ""pets"" dishes."
5,Beautiful,"If you're a fan who hasn't owned this music or hasn't owned it in decades, you cannot go wrong with this. It is what it is - a collection of number ones, and a nice collection at that."
1,Not her best work,"While Nancy has done some stunning work in her career, this CD is not one of them. Nancy is one of those artists who needs a particular producer to work magic on record, and with Lee Hazlewood and Billy Starnge, she had just that. But the production values on this CD give it a bit of a ""karaoke"" feel, and needs a much more professional hand. Also, her vocal doesn't seem nearly as melodic as she used to be, many artists' pipes don't age well, and Nancy is unfortunately one of them."
2,Inferior Quality,"I am very disappointed in the quality of this model. I purchased two, and I'm returning both. Coverage is poor, and CID does not work in all outlets in my house. Very strange. Uniden customer service pretty much confirmed that this model isn't very good. I'm much more satisfied with my Panasonic. I'm going to order a couple more of them to replace the Unidens."
4,Stealiong Beauty soundtrack,"The music is awesome. Divirsified and perfect for a lazy afternoon/evening cooking at home with your significant other. The DVD has beautiful scenerey but a plot that sucked. So glad I watched the movie to hear the soundtrack, You won't be disapointed-it's ageless."
4,Roland Gift?,Where is the Roland Gift song that played during the credit? I won't buy the soundtrack (even though eclectic and wonderful) without it!
2,Out of Date Mapping Software,"Having used the Mapsend software though out the western U.S. I found that, if where you're going has been there for a least 10 years Magellan Mapsend Streets Gold will get you there otherwise get a map. It's hard to believe Magellan can make such a good GPS and support it with such a poor software package."
2,Wishing for a newer version,"I too bought the MapSend Streets for help in traveling. The item is hoplessly out of date. Streets that have been here for 7 years or more are not listed on the disk. I would hope they would provide an update but so far have not seen one. Other than being out of date, it does work fine, easy to use, but how dependable is it if it is that out of date?"
2,A washed-out read,"Although it's artfully conceived, The Marriage of the Sea suffers from jump-cutting between its characters, none of whom breathe and come to life. The most convincing players are the two cities in which the action takes place, Venice and New Orleans. And while setting and the author's clever asides on the arts and in-vitro fertilization might be enough to carry a short story, this tale is too meagre for a book-length format."
4,lovely,"If you've ever been to Venice and New Orleans, you'll love this book - not to say that it isn't lovely otherwise, but I found it marvelously evocative of place."
3,A hard to understand account of revolutions,"I read (well, tried to read) this book for a class on revolutions. I found it very confusing and hard to understand. Granted I 'm only a college undergrad, but I like to give myself some credtit. I think most of the people in my class found it confusing and only understood it after the professor explained it in about one page of notes. From what I understand, Brinton is a brillant man which may be why this book seems to be written for brillant people."
5,Ok... it was good.,"Brillant costuming, brillant acting, and just plain good. Talk about the dynamics of spite and revenege based on the exploitation of innocence and sexuality... The only disappointment was with the 5.1 soundtrack... it could have been much better. But, in all fairness, music was probably not considered to be showcased in this movie. Although it was ripe for it. An excellently portrayed escapade. Didn't these people ever have health problems from their promiscuity?"
3,Troublemaker.,"Dangerous Liaisons starring Glenn Close, John Malkovich, and Michelle Pfeiffer star in this classic film. All three stars bring excitement, strength, and charmisa to their roles. Keanu Reeves and Uma Thurman also star as supporting and naive characters. Close is no stranger to playing an unappealing dame. I like this film but the language and costumes are too distracting to fully enjoy this old-fashioned film."
5,This is by far the best movie of all time,There is so much more to this movie than what appears on the surface. Watch emotions on the faces of the main characters. It's incredible. I've seen this movie probably 6 or 7 times. I cry every time.It is classic manipulation and subterfuge. A must see. Truly.
3,Not as good as Valmont,"Dangerous Liaisons is a good movie but nothing like Valmont, the other film version of the same book. Dangerous Liaisons is emotionless and humourless. When I watch it, I really couldn't care less about the characters. The actors are good in both movies but in Valmont most of them fit their roles better."
5,a film of a our times...,"I saw many times this film since that one appeared. What can i say? Is one of the best films of our time and with a beautiful ""mise en scène"". The best work from Glenn Close..."
5,stunning,"i absolutely loved this movie. Full of deceit, lies, and sex. It captures all the combinations to make an excellent movie. If you like ""Angels and Insects"" or ""Cruel Intentions"" , you will completely enjoy this movie.The cast are miracle workers. With Glenn Close and John Malkovich, you will believe the story they are telling.A must buy."
5,"Call it not costume drama, but high art","Ever seen Cruel Intentions? Then you must watch this, the finest retelling of the 18th c. Choderlos de Laclos novel, to see how it's done. This film is in many ways more modern than its teen-spun counterpart, thanks to the director's sensitivity to the era and to period filmmaking. The characters behave like natural participants in their environment, which was after all a greedy and prestige-driven society much like that of the 1980s. The dialogue is often hilariously wicked and catty, the sets and costumes are obsessively accurate, and the sexual tension is kept at a fever pitch. This film is an ""owner"" for any intelligent fan of cinema."
2,Way too scattered,The topic is good but the author crams way too much reporting into the book rather than concentrating on a few chosen stories of families on the home front.
5,A Great Little Book,This book along with Dyers Being in Balance 9 Principles offers a great step on the road to understanding what life is all about. It's a quick easy read that you will find yourself referring to over and over again. Contains the same ideas as many of Dyers longer works just in a shorter form.
4,Refreshing,"I received this book as a gift recently and read it over several weeks, which may also be an effective use of it for small groups, giving individuals a shared space for reading, listening, reflecting, and voicing their own thoughts and intuitions in response. It's a beautifully packaged book, and quite refreshing when read in small bits, otherwise it begins to feel like another one-way event where a celebrity coach talks and an audience simply sits and watches."
3,Good but not original,"i found this to be a good book .Full of useful information . yet i have read all this before , It is Eastern Philosophy . Buddhist and Hindu ,,, i have no idea why DR. Dyer did not give credit to Buddha ,,,,,for the non-attachment... live in the present chapters.if you you are not familar with eastern philosophy this will be a good book ,,,if you are you will be wondering as i did why you purchased it ,,as you already know what will be the next line.i reccomend awaken your Buddhist heart by lama Ram Das for a deeper spiritual movement"
3,Doesn't provide specifics on HOW to change behavior,"Overall a good, quick read but Dyer suggests we should stop being resentful or offended but doesn't explain how to stop that behavior. If your entire life, you have been programmed to become annoyed when someone mistreats you, it is difficult to alter that behavior without specific ways of changing your outlook. So while I agree with his philosophy, it's a lot of ""You should do this ..."" sort of advice that is short on how to actually achieve this way of thinking."
4,Gleaned some good info,There were a few really great chapters in this book but this has been mostly forgotten as I started reading Power of Intention which is phenomenal comparatively.
3,What you are getting here,"What you are getting here is not the ""beautifully illustrated journal"" or the ""10 Secrets for Success and Inner Peace Cards"" that you see if you click on the words ""SEARCH INSIDE!"" on the picture of this item's box.What you are buying is a box of 20 notecards with envelopes to fill out and send to people. The outsides of the cards look a lot like the cover of the box shown (there are five cards each of four different designs). The inside of the cards are completely blank. The envelopes are decorated a bit as well. They are very nice notecards in a too nice of a box. I guess that's why they cost so much.If you want the actual ""cards"" Amazon has those too. Just do a search for ""10 Secrests for Success and Inner Peace Cards"" and you will find them. I saw them in a book store. They are very nice too."
1,Golgo 13 Professional,"This DVD was comic. When I purchased, it showed Ken Takakura who is famous Japanese movie actor and acually acted Golgo 13 movie. But, not this DVD."
4,FOR TRUE GOLGO 13 FANS ONLY,I am a true Golgo 13 fan and i did enjoy it it was the worst however friends of mine did not enjoy it saying movie evermade and people should be shot for making such garbage but i enjoyed it and fans of the manga and anime probably will to.
3,"nice, but somewhat disappointed","I love Mel Carter's voice and was always captivated by his style when I saw him perform on the Doo-Wop shows with his hit ""Hold me,Thrill me,Kiss me"" so I expected all of his songs to be of the same caliber. I suppose it is just a matter of taste, but of the 10 songs on this album, I would rate them 7 in quality & composition.Overall, it is a good album & I'm glad to have it in my collection."
4,Nice chain for price,"I think that if you are looking for a basic chain you will not be disappointed - very nice simple chain, durable, and a nice difference than the serpent type chain!"
4,Nearly perfect chain,"This chain is lovely and delicate, yet strong enough to hold a pendant or prayer box. Clasp could be larger and easier to open and close."
2,It's cheap because it's cheap.,"Started tarnishing the day I opened it. I've had it for three months and it looks like an old, ugly, gold chain; when it started out as a sparkly, shiny, silver chain! Don't get it unless you're prepared with Silver Jewelry cleaner on hand."
5,Pretty Little Necklace,Can't beat the quality or the price! Just a perfect little necklace sparking necklace for most of my pendants.
5,I love it,This is my favorite movie of all time.Gregory Peck was great as Hugh O' Flaghtery.The musical score is excellent as is the acting.A great film.
5,Not a combat film,For war movie fans who want battle sequences on the big screen and that alone forget about this movie. This is a movie for people who want to see a drama/thriller set on location during the time of war.Gregory Peck as Irishman Monsr. Hugh O'Flaherty wants to save Jews and Allied service men and Christopher Plummer as Col Kapler tries to stop him. Both are well supported by Sir John Gielgud as the Pope.This is a roller coaster ride of plot and sub plots and to highlight them here may take away some of the colour of the movie.The script is well written and shows the internal struggles at the time as well as man's inhumanity to man.It is always a pleasure to see great scripts given to outstanding actors.This is a movie that should be in every library and can be rewatched repeatedly.
2,Just a gorefest,"I had high expectations for this movie, so imagine my chagrin when I realized that the dog- ""Beast"", was the smartest character in the entire movie. Do you ever get so mad at the idiotic victims in a movie that you just want to kill them yourselves and improve the gene pool? Well, that's how I felt. It was just a gorefest and lacked any real depth or substance because all it relied on was the gore shock factor. I was entirely disappointed and disturbed by all the senseless gore. Don't get me wrong, I am all about gory movies like SAW, the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre-any movie that has some real substance and leaves you with an impression. This movie Sucked with a capital S. But some of you may like it, my misguided husband did:)"
4,"Why is the ""UNRATED"" dvd 7 minutes SHORTER that the regular ""R"" rated version??","The ""unrated"" version is 101 mins and the ""R"" rated version is 108 mins. You'd think it would be the other way around, does anyone know? I just bought the UNRATED version and haven't seen either version yet. Without explaining the story, is there really a difference between the two? I know that ""WOLF CREEK"" had two versions on DVD and the only difference was some extra dialog in the Director's Cut and wasn't any different gore or violence wise than the ""R"" rated version. So what's the deal with THE HILLS HAVE EYES? Help!"
1,sick,"I love scary movies. I rented this thinking it would be scary and wound up turning it off half way through if that. the people who made this movie weren't aiming for horror in the traditional scence, they were just trying to see how sick they could make this movie. true saw was sick, but it has a story, a meaning, and it screwed with your head. This movie was just plain sick."
1,Pathetic excuse for a horror movie,this was one sick movie. if all you need from a horror movie is blood and gore then this movie is for you. the acting from the family members in the movie wasnt too bad but as far as anything else in the movie it was just ridiculous. i like pshycological thrillers but this definitely was not one of those. i wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone
2,"Scary, exhilarating, good, you've got to be kidding!!!","I watched this flick with my 16-year-old daughter this weekend. I haven't had so much enjoyment poking fun at a Stupid ""Horror?"" ""Thriller?"" since I saw Friday the 13th in 3D in the theater originally with a group of drunk friends! C'mon it was just plain bad. I surmised from seeing the film that Mutants don't die because their organs must be different when stabbed, beaten, or shot in the head or heart. Was I watching living mutants or Dawn of the Dead zombies -- YIKES!!! My daughter didn't even frighten by this one, and the gore was just that, only gore! The family was so obnoxious and dumb, you actually rooted for the mutants. Only the baby was innocent, and a decent actor in this truly dumb flick. You want horror or terror or suspense, rent an old Karloff, Chaney Jr., or Lugosi movie. This generation doesn't have a clue when it comes to horror. This type of movie was old with Michael Meyers and Jason!"
1,Sucks!,This movie was so deranged and sadistic. It was awful! To think someone would even want to make something like this is awful. Now I remember why I don't watch 21st century horror movies because they keep getting worse and worse!
3,"Well, it depends on your taste..","If you enjoy slasher flicks, this remake is a five-star horror movie, in my opinion. The death scenes are brutal, the pacing is relentless, the sense of doom and carnage is overwhelming, the gore is palpable.If you enjoy a movie that tells a compelling story, however, this is a 0 stars movie.Since my rating of three stars."
3,Average At Best,"Trying to cash in on what the remake of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre had, they have done the remake of the Hills Have Eyes. It is an alright movie, but not anything that blows me away. It is just the typical remake with unimpressive mutants. As someone else I was with stated, it took almost half the movie just to see the freaks, which is the only reason to watch this movie since the plot is garbage. The dumbest thing is that the dad hates his daughters boyfriend because he is a liberal democrat and yet the dad says that he is married to a hippie! So, hippies in the 60s were republican?This is just your average film and your Hollywood trying to cash in on this decade where remakes are big money makers."
3,blu-ray review,"This remake is good. Better than the original,because that one looks very old and fake to me.Video and audio are good. Extra's didn't check."
1,Revolting,"I'm not gonna bash people for liking this movie. because i wanted to like it, its definately my kind of movie. but i nearly threw up with the trailer scene and the rape. i thought wes craven was pretty good at filmaking but to put this into a movie is disgusting. Most of the girls i know were haunted by that scene days afterwards. i certainly dont speak for all women, but i have never felt so degrated by watching that scene. i will never watch another wes craven movie again. i wonder if people would feel differently if a man was raped? maybe i'm being overly dramatic, but are we that desensitized to women being raped that watching a disgusting mutant commit the rape is entertainment? it makes me sick"
3,To be honest,"I am going to be honest here. The movie was okay, but it wasn't necessarily what I thought it would be. I gave it three stars. I actually thought seriously about giving it only two stars. I wasn't particularly crazy about the movie."
4,"just ""ok""","this movie was just okay.of course it being a remake there's not that much to say about if it was good or not.but i think the actors did an alright job of covering it.i've seen some poorly made films where the actors just were terrible.so the acting in this movie was good, and of course i can't really argue the plot due to it being a remake.overall i gave it 4 stars basically just for the acting.if i were to rate the plot i'd give it a 3."
4,good read all around,"good, rolicking fun..no suprises but a good one..kind of chaotic in the last few chapters...one of his better books, shame no sequel"
2,piece of junk,I bought this pistol a couple of months ago.When I first got it it worked fine.Then after a month it stared to shoot a little worse. I was back from walking in the woods. I had shot it a couple of times.When I tried to shoot it all I heard was click so I looked at it and there is something jammed in it. so the barrel can not go all the way forward so it can not shoot at all.the only good things are that i could hit a box from 20 yards running and 30 prone .so it can punch through a cardboard box from 5 feet. the good things are It came with 2 clips which is good for a side arm .the fps is 315 the box also included a target and 40 BB's.the pistol as iron sites and a safety. Cause when you have it on your belt you don't want it to go off.The clips are a bit hard to load. I bought it from a sporting goods dealer by my house It honestly was a waste off money so don't buy it.
3,"Great for wearer, but not for the person you are talking to...","These are the thrid bluetooth headsets that my husband and I have purchased. They sound great for the person wearing the headset, but awful for the person you are talking to. There is a ton of background noise and the headsets drop quite often. The pros are that the headsets are very easy to set up and they do not hurt your ear. This is an okay headset, but not worth the price tag."
4,"101 STRINGS - GOLDEN HITS, VOL. 1",TEN TRACKS:1. Memories Are MAde of This2. Tenderly3. Come Fly With Me4. SRO (Standing Room Only)5. American Trilogy6. Anever On Sunday7. Nancy's Song8. Elvira Madigan Theme9. Portrait of You10. The Girl From Ipanema
4,Most terrifying opening,"I have to talk about this movie because everytime a Jeff Bridges movie is on TV I'm blown away by how talented the guy is. He can literally play anything and he's so underrated. Although maybe he likes staying that way so that he's not bothered by media and can play what he wants. This movie is in the 80s and has one of the most terrifying opening scenes of all time. No matter how many times I watch it, it bothers me. A killer is in a house he shouldn't be and brutally kills a woman, sadistically teasing her with rape before he does so. You see things from both the killer and victim's perspective and it gets me every time. Bridges has a sure equal in Glenn Close in one of my favorite roles of hers (minus Fatal Attraction.) This movie might be a little bit dated and have some unrealistic sequences but you wont like it any less for them. It definitely keeps you guessing until the end. I know the end and I still keep guessing. If you like Jeff Bridges, you must see this one."
4,"I enjoyed this DVD because of the good acting from the cast. Keeps you guessing, suspenseful and entertaining.","four star rating, Jeff Bridges is one of my favorite actors, as is Glen Close. Keeped me at the edge of my seat."
5,Excellent ab tape.,I use to do this ab tape in high school and had excellent results on my stomach. 10 years and 2 kids later I hadn't done any ab exercises and looked online for workout videos. Any ab workouts I've done do not compare to this tape. I still remembered it from high school so went online and ordered it. I have had great results with it yet again and am very happy I ordered it. Denise has 3 different segments in this video and each is 10 minutes. However I really enjoy the first two (Classic Abs and Non-Stop Abs) I do both of them everyday. If you're not familiar with Denise Austin she encourages you throughout the workout and talks to you as she's preforming the exercise. She tells you you're doing great and that you're going to look great. She's not too forceful and constant with it in case some people are annoyed by that.
3,Not what I expected from denises hit the spot series,I ususally love denise austin with her goofy attitude and her energy. I also like the fact that im clumsy and have no dance skills she makes her choreography easy to follow. However i was a little dissapointed in this video. I didnt get a good ab work out. i thought it was ineffective and way too easy. the second and third session is somewhat challenging but ill stick with the firm 5 day abs.
1,Old Style Letterbox Video,"DON""T BUY!The specifications are incorrect. This DVD is letterboxed and when played on a widescreen TV, there is a black bar all around the picture. The reason for this is the video is setup as 4:3 with a 16:9 letterbox image in the middle of the frame.Stupid 1990s technology! I thought all this stuff was gone by now. Little wonder the US lags far behind the rest of the world."
5,Great Soundtrack!,"This is a really really really good soundtrack! At first, I didn't really like it that much. But it really grew on me. I love it, it really captures the overall essence of the movie. The high points are ""Lovefool"" (Track 7) performed by The Cardigans and ""You And Me Song"" (Track 13) performed by The Wannadies. ""Lovefool"" is the original reason I bought the CD, also hoping that I would like the soundtrack, for I really enjoyed the music from the movie. I also really like the song ""Talk Show Host"" (Track 11) performed by Radiohead. I heard it in the movie and REALLY liked it. I like listening to it when it's cloudy and rainy. This is a really good soundtrack that I reccomend to anyone. You will especially like this soundtrack if you enjoyed the movie, which I did. Enjoy!"
4,Good! Good!,good! good! i especially love the radiohead song.. its beautifuland the number by quindon tarver is gorgeous.. and the cardigans song.
5,"Please, odd-numbered tracks only.","The odd-numbered tracks rate 5 stars. The even-numbered tracks rate 1 star. Why overall rating of 5 stars? Because I never listen to the even-numbered tracks. If you are a Garbage fan, then #1 Crush (trk 1) is worth the price of admission. If you've ever had a super crush or been someone's crush you will absolutely love and laugh along with this song. Angel (trk 3) is a gem by a hitherto obscure artist, Gavin Friday. Kissing You (trk 5) the theme by Des'ree is quite lovely and haunting. One of the best and original love themes ever. Lovefool (trk 7) is an over-the-top guilty pleasure that you can't stop enjoying even though you'll never admit it. Radiohead normally bores me but their Talk Show Host (trk 11) is really exceptional."
3,I Really Love This CD!,"I think this is the best soundtrack ever! My Favroite songs on the Cd are Angel by Gavin Friday, Pretty Piece of Flesh by One Inch Punch, and the You and Me song by the Wannadies. I also liked Kissing you and Talk Show Host and Everybody Free. If you like music that is sad and funny and romantic all at the same time, then I suggest you get this CD today!"
2,A not so interesting attempt at Lesbian Sci-Fi,"I was very dissappointed with Forrest's attempt at Lesbian Sci-Fi. After being totally tantalized by Curious Wine, I had high expectations about her work. This book was odd, incestuous, and lacked suspence."
4,magic,"I liked this one really. Mystic, magic, circus like, i will use it in my work during building up theatre performances.Continue that expression."
5,Lyrical and Devastating,"An exploration of the undercurrents of human existance, The Nature of Air and Water tells a seductive and sensory tale that weaves around Ireland, the pull of the sea, and the pull of myth. Myth is, after all, a metaphor for truths in life, and the main character in this novel is nearly consumed by the search for truth of her origins. In her description of the Tinker life, McBride's prose is both lyrical and devastating - envoking a vision of Ireland that is both gritty and enchanting."
5,"Excellent Book, Beautiful, Poetic, Suspenseful...I loved it.","I really enjoyed this book and would read it again. The language is beautiful and the visual images are vivid. The story is suspenseful, intriguing, and surprising. Character development is very good and the relationships are bizarre, yet believable and interesting. I read this book over a year ago and have read many other books since. I remember this book fondly as one of the best I have read in a while. Definitely worth checking it out if you like serious literature."
5,Registry Review in Computed Tomography,This review book is jammed-packed with sample registry style questions organized in an easy to follow format. It remains to be seen how effective it is until after I've taken the registry! I expect it will have given me the edge I need to succeed.
1,Desperately Needs An Update,"Good for anatomy and physics review, but not much else. A lot has changed since the book was written in 1996--multi-slice hellical scanning is not even covered in this volume. The protocols are woefully outdated. I therefore do not reccommend this book for registry review; certainly not if you can only afford to buy one book."
2,Bland,"I learned from this book that sometimes you only have one good novel in you; that you can write your heart out and still not get anywhere; that dialect will betray your unfamiliarity with culture; that doing something just because no one has before isn't a good enough reason.Card writes involving fiction that has been great, but this novel seldom rises above embarrassing. He's a good storyteller, even when the writing is abysmal, but if this book is any evidence, he's no novelist."
1,Least favorite Orson Scott Card book,"I've read and enjoyed just about everything Orson Scott Card has written; however, this book falls far short of his usual riveting storytelling. I found myself looking forward to the end of the book, rather than wanting it to continue on forever like the Ender Series.His attempted use of cultural lingo just seemed to be a bit off. Rather than pulling me into the story, it just made me sigh and wish for characters that spoke clearly.I'll continue to buy and read his other works because he's still one of the most talented authors around, but rest assured I will not be buying any Magic Street sequel should he decide to pen one."
2,Blah,The outside is very soft but the memory foam was too hard. It made my neck feel terrible and in an awkward position. Too hard and thick. I ended up buying one with a beeded interior.
1,"Jam, Jam, Jam, Jam Jam",I have seen two or three of this model jam on almost every document larger than 10 pages. Mine finally jammed itself into the repair shop.
4,DOUBLE YOUR JOY... DOUBLE YOUR FUN...,"Some people have mixed feelings about these 2 albums... It certainly has her veering off into different musical territory but that isn't bad either... Admittedly not as good as her first 4 albums but the songs are still interesting and fun to 'try' to sing along to... With exception to the 'OOH, OOH SONG' (which I think stinks - in both languages!!) Alot of the songs are fairly good and I would take WAY 2 much time too mention them all but for the price it ain't too bad... I still have the out of print cassette tapes from when I bought them in '88 or '89 and I probably won't listen to them as much when my CD's come in soon... It's a different musical style than her first 4 but is still a worthy effort if you are die hard PB fan... Out of print in the USA for quite some time you won't see many of these songs on her greatest hits albums... Too bad since it is a decent twofer..."
3,A somewhat mixed performance,"These are Pat Benatar's sixth and seventh albums, remastered on a single CD. The sound quality on these BGO Records editions is outstanding. The music, however, was curiously uneven. After five successful hard rock albums (four studio, one live), Pat Benatar began to experiment with a different sound. Tropico was gentler, with semi-acoustic arrangements. The music was pleasant, relaxing, and much less powerful. On Seven the Hard Way, Pat went back to the harder style that had made her famous. There are several outstanding cuts here, notably Invincible and Sex as a Weapon, while songs like Le Bel Age and Walking in the Underground deserved more airplay. Unfortunately, this album also contained several tracks that fell flat. In sum, both albums were something of a mixed performance."
5,"a lot of helpful discussions, diagrams, explanations",This book is all about Explaning the theory behind the applications. Reading the chapters was like being taught by Chang himself. I found it very helpful.
3,This is a confusing and non-specific college text.,"I use this text in a college preporatory (A.P.) class and find it very confusing. For specific definitions of principles, it is vague and unclear. Clearer definitions would greatly improve this edition."
1,Do you already know how to read music?,"If so, this book is a total waste of money. You learn how to read notes, rhythms, intervals, accidentals, and eventually chords on all the clefs. Tenor and alto clefs can easily be Wikipedia-ed any time. The book also eventually teaches you analysis and figured bass, integrating music history and all that good stuff, but the bottom line is that if you've played an instrument to any level of competency before, or know any shred of music theory, this is a waste of your money."
1,I've heard better from unofficial video game remixers.,"In Clive Manor, Michael Hedstrom tries his hand at the gothic horror genre and gives his reputation a black eye. The first three songs on this album belie the fourth, which comes off as overly repetitive and stagnant.The obviously synthesized music comes off as very technically displeasing, as one does not expect (nor should expect) computers to do the work of old folklore, as their ability to scare is about as non-dimensional as their personality. Personally, I have seen better music from unsung heroes of television and movie fame as well as virtual unknowns in the music industry.The track titled ""Storm"" provides nothing more than about 3/4 of a second of fake rain sound on permanent loop and approximately three different lightning strike sound effects with only a hint of wind. This album is not one I could recommend unless paid for every copy sold. Do not go to a Michael Hedstrom Halloween party and expect outstanding music from him."
4,Helpful little item,"I bought these spoons for measuring out small amounts of supplements for my sick dog. Got them in 3 days. Most of the supplements were dosed for 60-100 pound dogs...my dog is about 11 pounds. The spoons are perfect for this. After reading reviews, I'll dry them off instead of air dry, mark true measurements on them as one reviewer did. They seem sturdy enough for the job intended. As for reviews that complain about quality...hey what do you want for $6? Silver spoons? I dropped one star only because of the measure markings."
4,Their Very Helpful,I actually needed these to measure out some supplements for my cats. I found them to be perfect and exactly what I needed to get the exact dose. I'm sure I will be using them for other types of measurings and I am glad I bought them.
3,"measures are ""cute""",these measures are perfect for what I purchased them for - doling out small amounts of stevia for hot beverages. and they are adorable. i'm sure i would find their cutsie labels frustrating for serious cooking.
2,Talk about taking a sudden stoopud turn...,"The first two novellas, dealing with Sos the Rope and Var the Stick, are good reads. The third novella, which tells the story of Neq the Sword, takes the most appallingly stupid plot twist I've ever seen in a novel. Neq loses his hands and has a sword grafted directly to his arm. Kind of grotesque, but I could live with that a as a plot device. Not too many pages later, he has a glockenspiel superglued to the sword and becomes Neq the Glockenspiel. I flung the book across the room in disgust. The book is worth a look for the first two installments, but don't say you haven't been warned about the third."
2,"2,5 stars",Ok its not one of their best albums. We all know how good they went in their following albums and especially their masterpiece Cruelty and the beast. This album is only for collectors and its the most album that is most close to classic black metal.
3,Not many hiking trails listed,The Map Send Topo software is disappointing in that it has very few hiking trails shown. I bought this to use with a Magellan GPS unit. I also have DeLorme Topo software and it is far superior in ease of use and detail - many more trails shown and better graphics.
1,"Map info is off! Magellan says ""sorry about that!!!!""","I bought the MapSend Topo software, along with a 32MB memory card, to use with my new Meridian Marine GPS. What I've found so far is that the map locations shown in detail on the GPS screen are consistently off from the actual location. In the Pacific NW the error is moderate--when I drive down a street it shows me off to one side--consistently. In California it showed me off consistently by 1/2 block. In Hawaii it was consistently off by 1/4 mile!!!! Not very good when using the map data for hiking.I talked to Thales Navigation's customer support and they are aware of this problem. There is nothing you can do to correct the map's offset from reality. This seems to be related to the low quality of map that the support person stated they get for free from someone. The CD lists Woodalls (as in RV and campground guides) as a co-conspiritor, so I suspect the map data is from them...."
1,Worst Topo Maps Available?,"I purchased the Magellan SporTrak Topo GPS with MapSend Topo software. The topo maps are almost useless. The first thing I did was load the software on my PC and went to maps of areas where I am very familiar with the terrain. One creek near my home in California is at the bottom of a canyon with at least a 200 foot drop in elevation from the road above, but appears on the ""topo"" map to be on level land. Another map in my favorite hunting area in Wyoming shows a ""road"" and 4WD trails where only horse trails exist. My house appears on the wrong side of the freeway. These maps could get someone in real trouble."
1,Missing the Game!!,This video is missing roughly the last 3:30 of the first quarter!! It cuts off when its 7-3 TCU and the Badgers are inside the five yard line. The second quarter starts and its 14-10! Anyone who ordered this and has this kind of copy should get a FREE update of the ENTIRE GAME!!
2,"Sammi, Shelby and very poor sound quality","I totally understand the indignation of other reviewers. The sound quality of this CD is truly not acceptable. Some of the tracks sound like poor MP3s of worn out cassette copies of vinyl.People with music blogs would apologize profusely if they SHARED something like this. Of course the songs are amazing. Sammi Smith and Shelby Lynne have a very similar, gorgeous, melancholy sound. I hope that a serious label will release a double CD, using the master tapes. I'm sure they exist. The lovely compilation CD ""Country Soul Sisters"" by the UK label Souljazzrecords for instance has a crystal clear version of the magnificent Saunders Ferry Lane."
3,Dreams or a Nightmare?,"Loving Luis Royo's art & his fascinating scenarios I'm quick to buy all of his books. This book really didn't have what I expected to find, but there were some plusses. It seems that most of the work in this book is from a collection of Royo's work over the years & not a whole lot of new. What I found that was a plus about the book are some of the step by step techniques behind his creation of a painting & a few paintings that caught my eye including the cover piece. If you're a fan of Royo, add it to your collection. If you just discovered Royo, start with Malefic, Secrets, or Third Millennium."
2,Dream,well I have to be the biggest luis royo fan but this book was a huge disappointment. the best images in this book are the front cover and back cover... but thoose images arent represented inside the book... inside you will find mostly chessy book cover work and my main gripe is many of the images are so tiny... if you're new to luis royo I say check out malefic and secrets.. if you're a big fan.. I guess you would still want to get this.. but give it a look at your local bookstore to make sure you want it
4,Combination of a couple different recordings,"I was hoping this would be the actual vinyl version that I was brought up on, but it seems to be an incomplete compilation. Sad, because I'm used to all of the original tracks in its proper tracking order. Verdeales, Gitaneras and Andaluza and La Emperaora are the only tunes from that original release (where are the rest?)."
2,Not what I expected,"At first glimpse I assumed the game was more of an RPG and you can choose the girls as individuals. Of course you can change the positions of the girls but it's basically a line up of three girls combined as one. The jokes in the game are slightly funny and ""cute"" but as far as a great, entertaining game. NO. It was fun for about an 1hr then it became repetitive and boring...So no I didn't like it."
1,need cocktails to really enjoy the sameness,This is the flatest of the six CDs I own in this Ultra Lounge series. I just didn't dig the vibe. I was expecting more Dean Martin meets the Playboy Bunny Club. I enjoyed the liner notes as always but this one is a Frisbee really.
3,Janet Evanovich Box Set,"Kind of disappointing that it was abridged. I don't like abridged books. The person narrating it also read it too fast, seemingly without the emotion it deserves."
4,good,the program loaded just fine. the only proplem i have is the cd has to be in the computer to play the game. that i don't like. other cd's i have bought once u load the program you dont need the cd.
2,Not for children,"It looks good.It is easy to adjust.Your child will put feet on stupid useless hook on the underside of the tray and PRESTO, tray will be free. (first time at 10 months)Added bonus... a real pain to clean tray and seat.Great for adults. (quick adjust... one hand blah blah blah.)NOT FOR CHILDREN."
1,Don't buy this,"My little girl loves music and has her own cd collection so I thought Id get this so she could listen to them over and over in her room ;) This cd player just frustrated her. It doesn't work well, the buttons don't always work and even when you could get the cds to play, the volume doesnt go up over a whisper."
4,Great Regional cd with a lot of big names,1. Desiree - Oblio Joes2. Chopped - Dripped3. Center of Mass - Sunbrain4. 1979 - Polecat5. Pain - Old Man6. Figure 8 - Smashmouth7. Cold Showers - Grumpy8. Lil Suzy - The Phoids9. Skategirl - The Union10. Obvious - Atticus Finch11. Bullet For Me - Fischer12. Great - The Butterflies13. Pay Per View - Commander Venus14. Han Solo - Carmine15. C.B. - Slowdown Virginia16. Clothes Off - Painting Churches17. Role Reversal - Major Nelson18. Red Balloons - Chump19. Wide Awake - Michael20. Fleshy From The Wetter - Blightobody21. Focus - Woodenhorse
4,GREAT READ,I would have given this book a five but one thing I notice that is not in the reviews didn't say or ask... WHO WAS SUE PERKINS??? Ok read the book and you will know what I'm asking
4,Shannon Hoon will be forever missed,"After Shannon Hoon overdosed on cocain and died, his band members released this album. It's full of b-sides (even a song recorded on an answering machine) that never made it to their other two studio albums (including soup). The name of the album is Shannon's daughter's name. This is mostly filled with gems. I suggest it if you are a Blind Melon fan."
3,Bittersweet reminders,"Some real gems underscore what made this band's convincing chemistry so contagious, but sadly the majority of tracks highlight its b-side nature."
5,Great Space Saver,Fits three racks of ice cubes stacked vertically on the freezer. Great for saving space and keeping those ice cubes easy to access!
4,Reading with Tequila,"Sprig Muslin was so far outside of my comfort zone I continually postponed reading it. Out of library renewals, I finally sat down and read the book and I am so glad I did. While I did have to spend some time looking up words and phrases like ""box her ears"", abigail and dropsy, I found myself swept away in a world very much like those created by Jane Austen and the Bronte sisters, but with a touch more adventure. Sir Gareth was very entertaining, but I spent most of the book wanting to smack Amanda right in the mouth. She was one of those characters that you hate, but know how necessary they are to the story. And what a good story it was, with an ending that could only be described as completely heartwarming."
5,Volume 9 is an Ultra Lounge Triumph!,"This is my first and absolute favorite lounge CD. From the swingin' ""You're My Thrill"" (my fave) to the smooth ""Cha Cha Cha D'amor"" (from the King of Cool himself, Dean Martin), the songs on this CD are perfect for any setting. Background at brunch...full blast in the car...for ambiance at a Martini party...these are all-around ""feel good"" tracks that will keep you snapping. Many of my friends are hip-hop fans - even still, I've managed to sway them over to the ""cool"" side from time to time, thanks in large part to Volume 9. Kudos to the Ultra Lounge gang for this one!"
1,What Does Everyone See In This Book?,"It is immature and terribly predictable, even for YA standards. I wanted so to like it, enjoying a good ghost story, but it just seemed to poorly executed. I think it would have been more interesting to me if the reader would not know the intentions of Noah. To take a ride with Catherine so to speak."
5,WOW,Strawberry wine is a great song! We danced anyway is even better! Deana Carter takes country music to new level and stays true to country's roots! I am wondering why I've loved enough to know was never realsed because it would have given her another number one hit! This album is full of upbe at and slow songs that are great! My favorite song is number 6 on the CD it wasn't even a single it is titled before we ever heard goodbye. This album deserved to be the album of the year and to sell even more copies! Go Deana!
5,Great Phone !,"Ok, I got it from the box. Opened it, found it prettier than the ugly picture amazon has.Plugged it in the wall, left it for 24 hours, came back and there I was, ready to try it.I walked away from my house, about 300 feet away, and I could still hear perfectly and as clear as if I were next to the phone.I sure doesnt have many features, but oh well, it does what it is supposed to do, and very well."
1,A waste of money!,"I bought this book for my toddler in hopes to get him more familiar with my native language of Bengali. I regret the purchase. The book obviously wasn't fact-checked or reviewed by a native Bengali speaker because there are glaring errors in the book! For example, ""car"" in Bengali is ""gari"" (rhymes with ""sari""); if you believed this so-called dictionary, you would think Bengalis went around calling vehicles ""car"", written out phonetically in Bengali! I'm letting my child flip through the book but I do NOT intend to use it to teach him the written Bengali language."
2,prepare yourself!,"This shower curtain is bright and happy--BUT the colors are not as shown online. Rather than being earthy and muted (teal, olive, mustard), the colors are neon-pastel, much more Barbie-fantasy than they appear in the photo. I ordered it for the colors, so I was very disappointed."
4,"my Boondocks,your boondocks",Icannot being to express my adulation regarding Right to be hostile.Aaron McGruder briliant insight to what my urban world is like and that he masterfully had placed the intimate details in the hands of these children who have surpassed their peers and taken a stance on racsim and fitting into the status quo of our oppressed society.Bravo to Brother McGruder-you have a loyal fan for life.
1,Correct sensor...wrong harness,"I'm not sure as to why, but the sensor only has a 6"" wiring harness. the problem is that it needs at LEAST an 18"" to get to the adapter for the Upstream in this particular truck model. Went and picked 1 up locally and the harness was correct. Even if I was sent the downstrean sensor, the harness is too short. I don't understand..."
2,I didn't think it was possible for them to disappoint me but,". . . unfortunately, they did. I was looking forward to the release of this album with great expectations, and found it to be over-produced and (much of the time) corny. The whole album sounds thrown together, and the unspeakable things they did to the classic ""Here Comes the Sun"" are simply unforgivable. Oh, what might have been! They could have made a masterpiece out of that song, and instead they made a mockery. Now, I'm not saying the album is terrible, just not up to their normal awe-inspiring standards. I did, however, adore Elliots exceedingly cool scat section on ""Summertime Blues"". Most of the songs were blended too well, keeping a cold distance from the audience. Thankfully, they will never be able to reproduce this over-blown sound in concert! And with regards to George, I will be diplomatic and simply say, Barry, you will be greatly missed!"
5,Great product from Jo Malone,"I love this product. I use it every morning and night. I enjoy the scent of rosemary and lavender combination, it is very refreshing. This size is great to take along for travel."
5,Great Halloween Costume,My grandson loved wearing this for Halloween and as many times as his Mom would allow.
4,Cute halloween costume,"The costume is super cute, the hat is cheap but overall happy with the costume. My son was the only Mike we saw this Halloween and he got lots of compliments and the kids loved it."
3,"Very cute, sizing off and quality mediocre","My son looked extremely cute in this outfit and got lots of positive comments at Halloween. He wears a size 4, and getting this (rated size 4-6) over his body was a difficult affair (too tight around the legs, no stretch getting the arms and head in). The eye and hard hat were dented when they arrived, but I could punch out most of the dents.For a class party and one Halloween it worked great. Don't expect to pass it down to friends or family though."
3,Runs small!,"Description claims this costume fits up to size 6 but my grandson who just turned 2 in July can barely fit into it. If it is chilly the night he wears it, I will have to open the arm holes to allow for a heavier sweatshirt underneath. The costume is adorable, but you would NEVER get a size 6 child into it!"
3,Decent movie,"I thought the movie was ok. It had a few twists. Hayden Panettiere as the victim was ok, but Tim Daly pulled the movie through wih his brilliant acting."
1,HORRIBLE BOOK,"This book is so straight-out-of-high-school, its absurd. Mediocre at best. If you would like a mediocre resume with mediocre results then go ahead. Im happy I was able to get this book from a friend and not purchase myself."
3,Agreed. Works but flimsy.,"Works fine for hobby stuff. You have to get the neck real tight, however, to keep the fan from falling forwards."
2,only redeeming quality is some boobs and even they are not that good,"This movie is very lame. Horrible script, horrible writing and horrible acting. Who wrote this thing? It's so corny, and I do NOT mean that in a good or funny way. The only redeeming quality is boobs right? Well, then they should have at least had some hotter girls with better boobs. The opening scene in the locker room is probably the highlight of the movie and it goes downhill from there."
4,Very Pleased,Great value and the kids find it very comfortable. Drinks holder a little flimsy but very minor point as the kids don't use it anyway.
1,Disappointed,"The good thing about this booster seat is that it is wider and will hold an older child. But, it is difficult to put protective cover on. Instructions are so-so. It is all plastic, not like the competitor's cloth seat. I am returning this booster. It is the same price as the Cosco and Graco and I like them much better"
4,Updating the theory of constraints,"I certainly like Goldratt's writings, however this book adds a new and supportive dimension to the Theory of Constraints. Where many other TOC books insist on using the novel structure to enhance readibility this book gives much needed information and depth without long winded characterisations and subplots.Read in conjunction with Eli's books it makes the whole theory more punchy and useful. Therefore the book is timely and certainly recommended. Eric Noreen and his fellow authors have done a good job."
4,A comprehensive overview of business ethics,"In Ethics and the Conduct of Business, Boatright presents a well thought out and comprehensive study of Business and Ethics. Tracing the historical foundations of business ethics and deeply examining the moral, legal, and economic prespectives proves to be a worthwhile reading experience. Sometimes and bit dry but easily understood with worthy case examples, I would reccomend this book to any interested party."
4,Business Ethics,This is a good book to start studying the Business Ethics. Kind of convoluted to learn about the business ethics theories. The cases presented are very well described and right to the point based on the topics covered.
5,Great text and fast read,"This book is an easy read and has very good case study and example of multinationals dealing with ethics issues. I suppose one challenge of the text is that it is outdated and many of the cases are from the late 90s, and there aren't any updates on what has happened to/with these cases since."
5,Excellent book,I know I'm going to have to go back and read the book preceeding this one and read them both. I enjoyed this book immensely. I enjoyed the book for the mystery surrounding the murder case and watching the characters grapple with their past and present. This book is one you won't want to put down until you read the last page!!! Excellent read.
4,great read,"A very good book,i would suggest this to any one into hunting or alaska,very easy to read.ill read more of reardens books"
5,Alaska's Wolf Man:The 1915-55 Wilderness Adventures of Frank Glaser,A must read for every serious sportsman who thinks he's tough! Great life story!
5,LOVE IT!,"I love this eye liner, i went to a bunch of store comparing prices. and nothing had a reasonable price."
1,Crap,This eyeliner is suppose to be waterproof and it smudges so easily! Isn't waterproof suppose to not smudge or move at all? This gives you raccoon eyes.
5,Great Book,"I love reading embarassing moment books so when I came accross this book I just had to read it. I read it in one day, as a great quick read. Some of the stories you can relate to or hope they never happen to you. Either way this book is a must read for anyone who wants a quick book that makes you laugh."
1,Not enough patience,"I'm sure these kids are pretty talented on their own, but the songs are just excrutiating. I can't listen to more than one song at a time."
5,It's ALL GOOD!!!,My kids are wearing out their Hello Kitty boom box with this CD. The music is definitely different than the usual kids stuff we are used to hearing and the whole family loves it!
4,good value,"Haven't had this long so don't know yet how it will hold up but it was easy to assemble, although there were no directions in the box. Started using it immediately and it handles well."
5,AWESOME!!!,"This is an AWESOME trombone!!! It is very easy to play yet it produces a great, bold sound!!! The fingerings are the same for all brass. It was especially helpful during marching band."
2,Not what we hoped for,"We loved the song ""Main Street"" which is why we bought the CD. Our local radio station played that song frequently on Jazz times. We found the CD to be kind of boring. But main street is an awesome cut!"
5,Amazon.com - Blossom Dearie's Our Favorite Songs,"I remember listening to Blossom Dearie KCRW radio station years ago and I loved her girlish little voice. She is a wonderful jazz pianist and most definately doing New York jazz. I was thrilled that I could find a CD of her music because everything I have of hers is on vinyl. I have missed hearing her. This is a wonderful CD with several of my favorite songs, ""Bernie My Attorny"", ""I'm Hip"", and Peel Me a Grape"" very funny song and appropriate theme song for any ""high maintenace girlfriend""."
4,Great Songs by Blossom Dearie,Great songs in a laid back atmosphere. It's ridiculous that I need 13 more words. la la la la la
1,High tech - Low quality,"I agree with the previous review that this phone has an impressive functional capability, but I think the one that I received was released from manufacturing on Quality Assurance's day off. Fresh out of the box, all audio information changed volume level in a random manner,with no programming.This includes receive signals well asinformational beeps. At times the received signal would fade away entirely; even with the user standing next to the base unit.While programming inputs to the Directory, the ""save"" key began sticking. Again, the occurence was random; at times it would operate properly and at other times the key would have to be pushed from two to six times before the command would be executed.I reluctantly concluded that this puppy was not going to heal itself and that my only re course was to box it up and return it. I am getting another model Panasonic and trust that it will perform up to my expectations since I have one other Panasonic that has been flawless."
1,Extremely disappointed,"This product had zero truffle flavor, and basically was one pound of butter with black specs that cost $60 per pound. I think that this product must be very old as I have found that truffle oils lose their flavor after a couple of months. I think D'Artagnon should have better quality control. I don't think I would ever buy gourmet, perishable foods from Amazon or D'Artagnan again."
4,Is it worth the price?,"Unlike the Glass Slipper EP and Plank Of Fire, this single might actually be worth buying. Here you get two bonus tracks that are not on Fall Of The Plastic Empire. They are ""Hybrid Moments"" and a great acoustic version of ""Arctic Snow"". ""Hybrid Moments"" is actually one of the first songs Burning Brides had. It was first available on a 7"" with Icarus Line that is very hard to find now. The song itself does not even reach 2 minutes, but that's neither here nor there. If you love the Burning Brides (like I do) and are looking for rare songs by them (also try the aforementioned singles and the Nirvana tribute Smells Like Bleach), then certainly buy this single. Either way, I highly recommend Fall Of The Plastic Empire to start."
1,Deep Cover Soundtrack,"Well where should I start this CD is worst than the movie. All the songs are weak. If you getting this Cd because you like Deep cover song, don't get this CD there are prenty more out there, that are better and sound better. Also I lisen to this CD four times and I haven't found the extra track that people are saying in on the CD. I couldn't find it so don't get this CD other wise you are ""getting Deep""If you know what I mean."
3,"not bad, not great...","Main saving grace is Laurence Fishburne, who's an excellent actor and a pleasure to watch. The rest of the film is competent and so-so, but did keep my attention most of the time. The plot is not all that original, and like most action flicks kind of falls apart during the last 15 minutes, flying off the cliff into total implausibility.Not totally stupid like most action flicks, have to grant it that much.Does have a nice soundtrack though, even for someone like me who's not a big fan of hip-hop. That, along with Fishburne and the MTV-ish cinematography, kept me from giving this one 2 stars."
4,Zune Dock Heaven.,I bought this and loved it. It fits my first generation 30g Zune as well as my Zune HD. I read the reviews and found out it didn't have any cables so I went ahead and bought the cables. I love it and use it whenever possible.
2,It's ok... just ok,"If you want to buy this from a box store, then you are going to spend WAY too much. It difficult to get the Zune into the cradle because of where the hook-up sits in the holding area. The remote sucks! You might as well walk the extra 2 feet and push the buttons on the Zune - which defeats the purpose of having the cradle in the first place. Yes, I changes the battery in the remote.The same cable that plugs into Zune plugs into the back of the dock, so if you can get your Zune to stand up upright then you have no reason to by the hockey puck holder. However, if you think I am idiot - at least buy it from here - it's a LOT cheaper than Best Buy and other electronics stores."
1,So not worth the money,"Once I opend the package everything was working perfectly, for about 3 weeks then the speaker connection did not work. Then about a day later it started working again. Thought all was good, so I continued to use, then the whole thing just ended up dead and now its a 15.00 dollar paper weight (yes i still have it, who knows it might start working again)so overall the product is as cheap as you are paying for.Hope this review helps"
2,This Is the Way It Went and Went and Went,"While I agree with the previous reviewer in the assessment that any prior output of Arlie Carstens is worth hunting down, I definitely disagree with his estimation of how this Plan relates to Carstens' later work.To me, A Plan to Increase is fundamentally at odds with the directness of Juno's two full-length recordings, with the possible exception of ""Things Gone and Things Still Here,"" which was a necessary part of A Future Lived in Past Tense. Whereas that foray into storytelling allowed Carstens a respite from the overwhelming, personal intensity found elsewhere in his catalog, it didn't reek of the escapism found here. While there are hints of his poetic lyricism found in the nonfiction prose found here, it completely ignores the problems at hand, departing from the foundational appeal of Carstens' writing.I certainly hope that Ghost Wars does not return to this style of escapist writing."
3,A different Stacey,"I was 10 when the BSC was first created so I grew up with the series and adored the characters. I was Stacey. She was my favorite character, and we looked a lot alike. The first early books about her were wonderful, but in this book this has got to be a different Stacey. She isn't the same. She is out of sorts. The book is well written but the reason I gave it only 3 stars was because it's not as good as the original books about Stacey and the gang.In this book Stacey makes poor choices and has some lousy friends who use her and she's an airhead about it. She is so naive when they are using her; she thinks they're still innocent. I'm glad Mrs. McGill disciplines Stacey and lectures her about wising up to these loser girls.It's a shame that this series had to change so much; they were wonderful in the beginning. It's not a bad book, and a good read, just kind of cheesy at times."
3,not great!,this book was not what i thought it was going to be.it could've had more about the girls being bad.yeah they snuck alchohol into a concert and stole but the way ann made it sound it wasn't all that great
1,"Oh, for heaven's sake!",Why did Stacey had to be so mean to the Baby Sitters Club!. Doesn't she ever know that Charlotte Johanssen misses her?. I wished to give this book a 0.
5,Let's get physical Daphne,"Let me start by saying the review written under kelbon,s name is not true. I enjoy listening to this soundtrack very much my favorite song on it is ""Be with you"" by Carmen Rasmusen. I enjoy all the other songs as well."
2,An unpalatable album which leaves a bitter aftertaste.,"This album is nowhere near as powerful as Rust In Peace but, for the record, it was never supposed to be. Oh yes, Megadeth has sold out, but it occurred quite a while before this release, and yet even at their worst, ie with Cryptic Writings, Megadeth is still much better than the ""new"" Metallica. You want real metal? You ain't gonna find it on MTV or from bands performing on WWF."
4,Yes it is a commercial release...,"and man what an above avg the band did on this. I have said for sometime that Mustaine and company have grown leaps and bounds ahead of Metallica in the last 15 yrs and that Megadeth has released better overall material than Hetfield and Ulrich have. What you get w/ Cryptic is a fine blend of melody and heavy metal. Mustaine imo can outwrite anyone this side of Sixx / Lawless, he is that good. I can not wait to see them in concert when they hit Austin in March 10."
2,Just not enough,"Some great Deth tunes rock, but there are other that bite. The weak songs just make you pull this out of the CD player. Put in ""Rust In Peace"" and you will listen to it for days on end, until it turns to years."
5,Good!!,This is another example of how good Megadeth is. Totally different then any other albums and it stil rocks. Megadeth are a great Metal band. Buy this album today!
4,MY FABULOUS MANDUKA YOGA MAT WORTH THE EXTRA $$$$,"I've been doing aggressive vinyasa flow level 2-3 yoga classes for three years now, and have gone through quite a few mats that start deteriorating quickly, slip when sweaty, and have little knee padding for some strenuous poses. I've been using the black 71"" Manduka mat for about 3 months now, and although I still slip a little bit when sweaty, the dense padding is worth the extra carrying around weight of this mat, as is the extra wide width. It truly is top quality, and I think it'll hold up for many years to come. I did have to purchase a new carrying bag to accommodate the longer length. So far it's the best mat I've owned. Impressive."
2,Too Hard,"I should've checked this out in a store before purchasing. I ended up selling it on Craigslist and buying a softer one.The mat is just too HARD for my taste. I've been doing yoga for 30+ years (I'm 51) and my body needs a thick, cushy mat. I bought a slightly cheaper (thicker) Manduka mat that is working just fine."
5,Best mat,I have skier and sports knees which get sore from time to time and this mat is super absorbant of the impact and really lessens the of the otherwise hardwood floor
4,Wonderful,"I am loving my new mat! It provides more cushioning for my knees which feels great. It is a bit slick at first, but with use and following the directions that came with the mat (as well as some of the suggestions made in other Amazon reviews)the slickness goes away."
3,No need to spend the money and VERY heavy,"I'm a yoga instructor and decided to treat myself to a primo yoga mat when my old mat started to wear thin. I ordered this one after reading the reviews but I guess it didn't sink in how heavy this baby is. If you only have to carry this to class, you're golden. In fact, you will get an excellent upper body workout just walking to class. If you are like me and have to carry extra yoga mats, eye pillows, a gym bag and a 13 month old, forget it. I just didn't see what was so great about this one. For that price it should do yoga FOR YOU. There are nice, thick yoga mats out there that cost half as much. Wai Lana makes some premium mats that are very nice. As for me, I think I'll try the Drishti next."
4,Job well done,"As a fan of Debbie Macomber, I wasn't suprised at how much I liked the book. I did find it a little unbelieveable how soon into the story Joy started to fall in love with Sloan. Other than that, this book is a good story. Joy Neilsen's character is easy to like!"
5,Full of Great ideas,"When I want to stretch the minds of my students, I grab a Blevins book. All of his recommendations are based on solid research and really work in the classroom."
4,Good Book,"This is a fair book for Phonemic Awareness Activities. However, As a reading specialist and first grade teacher, I prefer the two books below. I use them on a daily basis and find them indispensable! They both come with ready to use activities that are motivating and fun! The kids absolutely love the activities!!Quick Small Group Reading Activities for Struggling Students by Sandy TurleyQuick Small Group Reading Activities for Struggling StudentsANDPhonemic Awareness: Playing with Sounds to Strengthen Beginning Readers by Jo Fitzpatrick and Catherine YuhPhonemic Awareness: Playing With Sounds to Strengthen Beginning Reading Skills."
2,Buy it--but in the tube instead,"This is a wonderful product, but you should buy it in the plastic tube instead. The tin taints the scent and flavor of the lip gloss, and makes an otherwise wonderful product a little offensive."
4,Great quality but takes a bit to easily apply to lips,"I do animal rescue & am very anti cruelty. Luckily Burts Bees doesnt do animal testing & is a brand I can use.I love this kind because of the mint & because it (well every Burt's bees product really) keeps my lips moist & this one smells good to. My only complaint is that with every Burt's Bees Chapstick I get, I find myself pressing on my lips hard to apply it because the chapsticks do not warm up & melt off onto your lips very well. Its a mild annoyance & I still frequently buy Burt's Bees Chapstick products."
5,AMAZING,"I started using this product about a year ago, when i started using it, it burnt my lips. But, now my lips barely even have wrinkles and look perfect!!!!!!!!!! Thank you Burt's Bees!!!!"
2,"its ok.... follows the formula, nothing too special","i bought this cd looking for some feel good music, thought id enjoy it, but after a listen I can say there are about 3 good (not great but ok) songs, The Boy All the Bad Girls Want included. but 3/19 just doesnt' cut it. the songs are all normal, nothing out of the ordinary, and talk about the same replayed things. this is crappy poppunk."
4,Different . . .,"This book was OK, although I didn't like how it ended with Jason, Marissa is sooooo annoying! Overall, it was a great book and I recommend it to any SV fan :)"
2,Sorry but I am not been able to see the movie,"I don't know what to do, because I am not able to see the dvd, because it is said No on Region, So I can't play the dvd. What can I do? I would like to add that I am very please with Amazon and the prompt respond to delivery the products."
4,Selena,"Very close to the best movie i've seen, Selena is the story of the famous Latina singer who was gunned down at the peak of her skyrocketing career. Selena's story is one of the best known to all Latinos and because of this great movie many other people know about it too. The music and concert scenes are the best in this movie and are very well re-created and they can best be heard with a good Sourround Sound System. Jennifer Lopez, who is now the most well known Latina, is very convincing as Selena and gives a chilling interpretation of the diva's life. The DVD is one of the worst i own but it still gives some good information. This film is a must see for all."
5,A movie that impacts all of us,This movie depicts the life of Selena Quintilla-Perez from her rise to music as a child to her death at the tender age of 23. Director Gregory Nava couldn't have directed this movie better because he directed it perfectly. Jennifer Lopez did an A+ job portraying Selena and on top of that bares a striking resemblance to her. Edward James Olmos and Constance Marie were also great as Abraham and Marcella Quintilla. Edward James Olmos shows off his versatility and what a job they did with make-up and all that stuff for Constance Marie as her character got older on top of her top-notch performance. Jon Seda did a great as Selena's husband Chris along with Jacob Vargas playing A.B. and that actress who plays Suzie. The ending is sad but unforgetable and this is a top-tier movie that should have won some awards (Damn you Oscars!). This movie is jaw-dropping and heart-warming!
1,Salina. The real ife story as a movie of Salina,This item was bought for my 13yr old daughter for Christmas and it does not work in our DVD player. It comes up with a message like area zone not correct and then just doesn't play. I would like to return it and get it replaced with one that works but I dont know how to go about it. I think maybe the item is to play in an american type DVD player and I have an Australian DVD player???
3,Just OK,"For some reason this movie bored me and I restlessly waited for it to end. It's not like the acting was really bad or anything, I just didn't get in to it."
3,Documentation is hard to follow,I bought this as a novice to sewing. The documentation that comes with the machine is rather hard to understand. The controls can be confusing. I have figured it out now and I have to say the machine works great once you figure out how to use the controls. I didn't get much help from the book and just did some testing and troubleshooting on my own.
4,leon russell live,"classic sounds by an expert musician, mixes new with rock and jazz blends with a touch of the south creole style, hard to find in any other musician. The blend of his classic keyboard working the chords that blend with his own original southern twists make this a clssic album."
4,A Buried Treasure,"I first became familiar with Tony Guerrero a few years back when I heard Mysterie from this CD on Music Choice. I picked up this CD in a used CD store and it turned out to be a great find. There are a number of smooth and relaxing songs featuring flugelhorn on the CD including ""Mysterie"", ""Uptown"", ""Beautiful"", ""All Night Long"" and ""First Love"". This cd is usually only available used now and rather inexpensively I might add. Don't let the low price scare you as to its quality, it's very good."
5,Blossom Dearie should be re-issued.,"It's a shame that the Blossom Dearie CDs are no longer available. Daffodil Records was Blossom Dearie's own label, but it appears that she is no longer distributing her work. She's a brilliant jazz artist, and her work deserves to live on and to be available on Amazon. This CD, Et Tu Bruce, deserves the 5 star rating. It's witty and clever. Blossom Dearie is a unique jazz icon."
5,replacement for an older one,I had this one before.....without the stand. this is a great piece to use for wine....very easy and very efficient!!
1,The authors spammed me with an ad for this book,"I have not read the book but I have received email spam directly from the authors advertising this book.Apparently, the authors believe spamming is an acceptable way to advertise their book and spread their religion. I think that says it all about their ethics.I don't think spammers should be supported so I suggest, please do not buy this book."
1,Toxic to birds!,"When I received this product, I was shocked to read on the label that it is TOXIC TO BIRDS! How can a product be considered ""green"" if it kills birds?? How is it possible that the EPA is even allowing this product to be sold? I would imagine that pretty much every application for it is for an outdoor water feature and that birds are drinking from it regularly. Another reviewer mentioned that she had seen birds drinking from her pond while she's been using this and that there have been no problems. Well, how does she know? The birds are probably dying somewhere else. Unfortunately, they can't read the label to see that they're drinking poison. PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!"
5,At least three movies in one,"Bush League is a movie about international development wrapped in a movie about soccer, and much more besides. The film alternates easily between the practical challenges facing a small soccer team and a discussion of classic development challenges like getting community buy-in for a project that serves one group more than another. Should be required viewing by Peace Corps volunteers and USAID staffers. Some of the footage -- including the funeral of a five year old -- is riveting, and the discussion of HIV is masterful for its subtlety."
1,don't waste your money if you are a christian,turned it off half way....thought it might be good...it's not...very secular view..not for christians...wish i didnt waste my money.
1,Not satisfied with labeling on product or results,I am not pleased with the results of having used this product. I have taken for nearly a month with no good results. Also the product listings on the container are not clear and not specifically listed as to just what the product contains. Would not purchase again and I am sorry I purchased 2 bottles of this product.
5,PC-Cillin -- The Best Virus Control,"I have installed this product on all of our systems because it is the best protection available, user friendly, and able to meet the challanges of the the deranged who would try and mess up your system."
5,great product!,We are very happy with our purchase of PC-cillin 3 pak. Great price and fast delivery.
4,Three and a half stars,"This is pretty good. It's not smashing great, but it's certainly worth seeing for anyone that finds the premise interesting. I've never been a big Travolta fan, but I did enjoy him in this. His southern accent isn't bad, and it's nice to see him looking old and grey haired and ill for a change. I think Scarlett Johanson is even better, though. She quite a natural actor with an unusual, flawed beauty. She doesn't overdo the Southerness, but speaks with just enough inflection that you believe she's who she's supposed to be. The movie does tie things up sort of neatly by the end, redemption and peace all around, but that's okay. It didn't sing to me, and yet I do find it a competent movie, humrorous at times and certainly worth your time."
3,Better than you've heard,Damaged characters in NOLA. Before Katrina. Makes it even more interesting than anticipated. Travolta works well. Worth a look.
3,Only 3 videos out of 8 are actually cartoons.,"The only cartoons on the whole DVD are Hector's Hectic Life, The Shanty Where Santy Claus Lives, and Christmas Night. Everything else is either a puppet show (the second video) or live-action. Slightly annoying, but considering I only paid $0.28 (minus shipping charges) I can't be too angry."
3,No pinyin,"You are given the english word and the chinese character for each object. There is no pinyin pronunciation for each object. Unless you have an audio CD, you won't know how to say the Chinese character."
4,INFORMATIVE AND PRETTY!!!!!!!!!!,"The hardback edition of this book is one of the most beautiful I've ever seen! As for the contents, well, they're exceptional. It covers world records in sports, human endurance, nature, movies, tv, music, human achievement, and more. Who is the oldest living person? Find out in this book. What is the fastest speed attained by a jet? Find out in this informative publication. Who really has had the most gold records by a single male performer? All you have to do is get this book, and you'll know. There's loads of colorful pictures, and on pages that are made of good stock. The book is a trivia buffs dream. Other books I would recommend for trivia buffs, are The World Almanac, and the ESPN Sports Almanac. All three are superb. If you want to know what the world records are for an array of topics, please get this insightful publication."
2,Pricey and dries out fast,This ink is expensive and it will dry out unless you print discs all the time. I had to finally sell my Bravo because I was exasperated.
3,Cartridge was Replaced,"The cartridges that I previously ordered had an expired refund date. However, since the one cartridge was simply defective and wouldn't work I contacted Amazon and they promptly sent me another one. It's always a pleasure dealing with Amazon as they have the best customer service going."
2,"Short, simple but sweet","I played this simple adventure game with my 3 year old son and it took us about an hour. There are a few easy puzzles - find a key hidden in one of hour spots on screen, put a broken pot back together with the four pieces you have, find all the acorns scattered throughout the game, etc. There are several animated sequences with characters and voices from the Winnie-the-Pooh shows. The best part was the in-game painting activity that lets your mix your own colors and paint a variety of blank pages. Considering I paid $15 for this product I was disappointed. There are free ipad apps which are just as much fun and last longer."
5,A Fantastic Album,"In an age of pop music fluff with no meaning or heart the Smoking Popes touching ballads about love and life are brilliant insights. For everyone that's ever had unrequited love, buy this album."
2,Two thumbs down,"I've only listened to the whole thing in its entirety once, but my disappointment in it prevents me from wanting to hear it again. I suppose if I hear it more times it may grow on me, but for the most part, I want my money back. But like all reviews, that's just my opinion. ( ""let's hear it for love""? Hahaha what kind of corny title is that?)"
4,Gits - Cheap Indian Food,"If you can get over the fact this stuff was pooped out of a machine into a foil wrapper, so that it resembles astronaut food, it's the cheapest way to get Indian food. It actually tastes pretty good. I've tried other Gits food and they were all acceptable. It might even be a good thing to take camping because of its durability and low weight.My momma was too drunk to be an astronaut, but even she says Gits Palak Paneer is tasty stuff."
4,Good Sinatra Vehicle,Very well done and gripping. I liked how the main character is torn between the case and his wife's illness - two very different story lines that affect him deeply. Good thriller.
2,Sure cure for insomnia,"I think Frank Sinatra was a fine actor, better than he was given credit for. But here he just looks plain tired, and sleepwalks his way through the part. Not that it matters - the script is dreadful, silly, and boring. Don't waste your time."
4,Pleasantly surprised,"I'm always excited when I have a chance to review books from our readers. When SECOND CHANCES arrived, two things stood out to me: the beautiful rose on the cover and all those pages behind it! Once I started reading though, I forgot about all the length, due to the eye-easy large type and interesting story.Told through the first person, this story tells the tale of Denise Howard, a recently divorced mother of two, and the journey she takes through single parenthood, dating, and child custody battles.Determined to reach her dreams, long abandoned to embrace those of her husband, a well known politician, Denise sorts through her past, allowing God to direct her future. The lives of Denise's friends, Dee and Kim, make for interesting subplots as they too seek to embrace God's second chances after triumphs and tragedies in their own lives. An entertaining read.--Marilynn Griffith"
1,allergic,"I really liked the fragrance except when I wore it, it made me itch and I kind of broke out with a rash. I had to toss it."
3,"Well, if you love Alpha Centauri...","""Interesting"" little piece about Gaians first discovering the potential (and eventual) use of the mind worms as military units against the persistant Morgans. The airbrushed art is... quite dated and in some panels, they use actual screenshots from the game. LOL.As another review said, there are paragraphs of text sometimes.Ultimately, I would only recommend for people who love anything associated with SMAC. Casual likers can easily skip this expanded universe."
2,This doesn't sound christmasy or even wintery 4 that matter,"DIS-a-PPOIN-ting! Nevermind that they're mundane renditions of traditional carols -- this is the most unwintery-sounding ""winter"" CD I've ever heard. Too mediocre to replay, and not memorable enough to deserve a more detailed description, I sold it.I've heard lots of her other work, but I don't believe all the fuss over ""Loreena McKinnett"" is warranted. She's got some talent, but she doesn't enchant and enthrall me the way she apparently does others."
3,CD is not long enough,"Lest anyone mistake, I did not give this CD 3 Stars because it is subpar in quality. Rather, I was merely hoping for a longer album. It costs less than the rest of McKennitt's CDs, but is still a fairly steep price for only 22 or so minutes of music. It would have been nice to hear Mckennitt sing ""Silent Night"" and / or ""We Three Kings."" It also would have been a nice touch to tack on the ""Greensleeves"" track from her ""The Visit"" album, both because it would have fit the mood of this holiday CD, and it would have extended the rather terse playing time.In any case, what you do get with this CD is the same level of excellence that Mckennitt's fans have grown to expect. I have never been really big on albums which are totally dedicated to Christmas music, but made an exception in this case. If you don't mind that the CD is very brief in length, maybe you should, too."
4,"Good, but not perfect","Being a relatively new McKennitt fan, I had high expectations of this mini-album, especially for God rest ye merry gentlemen (one of my alltime Christmas favorites). The album didn't disappoint, but didn't manage to really blow me away either. Perhaps it has to grow on me, or maybe I'm just spoiled rotten with ""A celtic heartbeat Christmas"" on the Celtic Heartbeat label."
5,Perfect for Infants & Toddlers!,"My son loved this toy as infant and still enjoys it as a toddler. As an infant her enjoyed opening the door and placing the pieces in. As a toddler he likes to put the puzzle together and work on putting the letters through the sorter. This toy is great for hand eye coordination, fine and gross motor skill refinement, and challenges them to sort out while working through a small puzzle. It teaches them shapes, colors and animals as well. I love the price tag for all the educational quality that this toy has. It is also well made good quality toy. The handle is also great for toting it around. This is a fun and educational toy."
3,Just ok,"I gave this three starts because even though I was not super impressed with the toy, the price was still reasonable.I think the barn door could have been made a little easier to open with little fingers."
2,Not that great,"Very cute, but the colors of the letters don't match the color of the slots they go in. Seems like they should like the animals do. Also the door is very hard to open and our son dropped it and it popped off, now it's almost impossible to get back on. Look for a different shape sorter I suggest . . ."
5,You'll never think of caviar the same way again,"This is a great read, set a present-day thriller in the delta of California's Sacramento River. Russell gives us a powerful sense of place, confjures up a whole new breed of creey bad guys, and raises our environmental awareness without sounding like Al Gore on a bad day.The first thing I did when I finished the book was to make a reservation for brunch at the Ryde Hotel--mentioned twice in Dead Game--so I could head out to the delta and experience again the sights, sounds and smells Russell evokes in his book."
5,The movie ain't got nothin' on dis'!,"This was the first album I ever bought in 1998 and I'm glad that it was cuz this is soul/funk/rock at Ike and Tina's best, the movie angela bassett was in as tina ain'tgot nothin' on the real life goddess of rock Tina is. This is explosive and if you can't handle dynamite, don't pick it up!"
4,works,"This product arrived on time, was delivered as described, and completely met my expectations. No surprises, just a product that is as you would expect."
1,to small,My father has this release and i used it and liked it so i wanted to get one for myself but when it arrived it was a junior size made for a 4 year old and was not even close to fitting me but if you can get the adult size it is a nice release and is rather in inexpensive.
4,Very good,"This release is very good quality, I like the trigger action, sensitivity is just right. Easy to put on. I also have a more expensive Scott release and actually like this one more be cause of the single strap making it easier to put on."
1,"Good music, bad production","No complaints with the music itself but this CD sounds mediocre on my stereo. The instruments do not have a sharp, in the room with you sound. They sound muffled to me. I purchased Clinch Mountain Sweethearts at the same time. That CD I'm keeping. This one is (reluctantly) going in the trash due to its production quality, not Mr. Stanley's music."
2,A fair book,"This wasn't a favorite book of mine to read, though it was decent. I find myself questioning throughout the book if what we see in the book is how it really happened, or if it's just through Michal's mind, since she is the daughter of a king who went mad. I'm not sure if I would recommend it to others, though."
4,Entertaining but certainly revisionist,"India Edghill writes an entertaining story with her first book, Queenmaker. She writes of King David's first wife and daughter of King Saul, of which the Bible says very little. Some of the names of key players have been changed, as well as details that are very clear in the bible. The death of King Saul's first born to Bathsheba is completely ignored, and Jonathon's crippled son is given a new name. The story of Amnon, Tamar, and Absalom is completely re-written to reassign the roles of villain, protector, and victim. A good read, but don't take it for ""gospel"" that it's the true story."
2,Disappointing,"If you are a Christian and you are looking for a book that closely follows the story of David and his family as related in the Old Testament, then this is not a book for you. I was very disturbed by the way this tale portrays King David (as an egomaniac) and by the drastic changes made in the biblical accounts of his family members. In the same way that I found _The Red Tent_ to be anti-Christian, I feel likewise about this book and wish I had never read it. It is not a book I will keep and I could ever pass it along to a fellow Christian woman."
4,Warning: Fans of King David Might Not Like This Book,"Lovers of historical/Biblical fiction may very well adore this different version of the King David story. All most readers have to do to appreciate it is to keep an open mind, as the well-loved monarch is portrayed in a less-than-flattering light here. New twists on the story are also liberally sprinkled in along the way, to the possible dismay of those who want to read about the heroic David of the Bible. Significant events as we know them from the traditional tale remain the same. What gives this novel such a spin are the goings-on behind the scenes, where King Saul's daughter Michal appears to have the upper hand.Readers who hold more conservative views might prefer to skip this one, unless they remember it is but a fictionalized account, but more radical thinkers open to anything have nothing to lose by giving QUEENMAKER a try."
2,Inaccuracies hinder what could have been a great book,"Right away I was very distracted while reading the book. The author did not stay true to any of the Biblical story- save for the basic plot line (and she even changed parts of that too!). Every new chapter I liked the book less, even though her writing is phenomenal. It definitely drew me into the story and was very vivid and interesting...but I think that had she used more facts in the novel it could have been much much better. Historical fiction needs to contain enough truth to make it believable, and this just wasn't."
3,Definitely Not His Best,"As a long time fan of the 'Burke' novels and indeed all things 'Vachss' I started this novel with my usual eagerness. It started well, punchy, good plot etc., then slowly drifted off, going nowhere. First time ever finding myself bored with a Burke novel. The last third appeared rushed, and was definitely not anywhere near as tightly written as usual. The ending was simply dire, not worth the effort to get there. If you've never read anything by Andrew Vachss don't start with this, but do read him, his previous books are excellent. I look forward to a return to form."
5,Like a calming rain,"Remember when you were young and wanted to play in the rain? This is just like that. I bought some and installed one in each bathroom. I tightened them up with a wrench and had no leaking issues. Before I installed this I removed the low-flow element in the back and it really livened it up. It wal like a nice rainforest rain, warm and relaxing. By removing the element from the back(simply remove the black O-ring and then unscrew the white plastic piece from the head) it made the rain pour down so that it performed very well at cleaning you also(After all isn't that the point)"
5,A Beautiful Blu-ray Experience,"As a Blu-ray presentation you won't get much better than this. House of Flying Daggers on Blu-ray is a true HD remaster and you will know that as soon as it starts playing. After being burned myself on some BD releases that were barely upgraded from DVD, you can purchase this one with confidence.Along with a wonderful picture the disc includes an HD audio track in Chinese. If your system can play HD audio then that's the best way to watch this movie, even if you don't like subtitles. It's terrible that all BD releases don't have a HD audio track because it's really eye opening when you listen to it back to back with the regular 5.1.There are a few extras, though I don't pay attention to them so you'll have to discover them yourself. This film does not use any BD Live functions that I could find.If you want an entertaining movie that shows off the best your HDTV can offer then you can't go wrong here."
5,One of my favorite movies of all time,"I was blown away by this movie. The echo game scene is an amazing thing of beauty. I only wish there was some better bonus features on the disc, but still dont let that stop you from getting it. A must buy."
2,"Flying Daggers - Really, REALLY Bad Bluray Xfer!","Seeing this in the theaters years ago was a beautiful experience of deep color and fantastic images. Too bad Sony, who did a poor job on the dvd pass 5 years ago on this film, just dumped off their badly xfered hdcam to the new bluray format a few years ago. Such a shame to see such an amazing film just go into the gutter. This film looked fantastic in the theaters - it could look just the same on Bluray!Hopefully, this will not occur on the film Hero, a similarly shot martial arts film, which is due for a bluray xfer as well. Sure, a lot of the first titles to go out on Bluray years ago were poorly mastered - let's just hope this changes for the better - because so far there is only one chance to do it right!"
2,Overcooked and burning,"When you've seen Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, you've seen them all. Although I can't speak for Hero. That I have yet to see but for this movie, eh. I'm not impressed.Why? Well, the story was good, I'll give it that but how the characters met and the fighting scenes make this movie and unbelievable and over-done romp."
2,"This is no Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon...","As longtime fan of Hong Kong cinema, I really looked forward to seeing this in the theater. Unfortunately, while I like the stars of the film, I found the movie itself to be very tedious. The story was nothing new, the locations were uninteresting. I think the plot's problem is there are no good supporting players to make the stars shine. It's just the 3 of them.If you really want to see a good swordplay movie, check out the classics like Bride with White Hair, or the Swordsman trilogy. Other than CTHD, there are no good movies coming out of HK for a long time now. This movie was attempting to be pretty like CT,HD, but did not have the level of story telling at all."
3,This is HD (720P) not Full HD (1080P),"This is a beautiful movie with colorful costumes and sweet acting, but I was dissapointed to find that it was encoded in HD (1280 x 720) 720P format rather than Full HD (1920 x 1080) 1080P format. If you have an HD TV you will be fine, but if you have a Full HD 1080P TV you will not be seeing the best resolution possible for your TV. Apart from resolution, the color is very good."
3,"A bit disappointing, but good action",Not as good or moving as Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon. Characters lacked complexity and were a bit one dimensional.
2,This HD sux,I got this dvd because i was excepting sweet HD and didn't get it. The quality of the picture wasn't much better than a DVD. The storyline was okay but as far as next gen disks go it lacked.
2,Disappointing,"""Better than Crouching Tiger,"" they said. I couldn't wait.Eh.There are a couple of cool action sequences, but in the end you feel there should have been many more. Too much screen time is used to progress the love story, and the pace slackens then to a crawl. You feel as though the main body of the story is missing.There's a sequence at the beginning, the Echo Game, which is just terribly paced - minutes and minutes of slow-motion cloth-flinging. That was a really bad sign.The ending seems lazy in terms of choreography. A couple of nifty tricks, but a lot of rolling around in the snow.In the end, I preferred Crouching Tiger's amazing fights and its plot, leaving aside its overlong romantic excursions."
2,Beautifully composed trifle,"""House of Flying Daggers"" is a truly beautiful film. The color palettes for different scenes, the locations, the costuming - every visual element of this film was carefully selected and then used to its best advantage. The cinematography is spectacular. Each frame could almost be a painting.But all of this painstaking art is in service of a predictable and overly-long story. If you've ever watched a movie, you know about 5 minutes into this one where it's going and how it's going to end. And man, does this movie take its time getting there. When you essentially have 3 characters, it's tough to round out 2 hours of viewing time with those three people - especially when the story is nothing new.It's worth a rent if you're into Chinese cinema and aren't expecting epic kung-fu battles. Otherwise, ""Hero"" or ""Crouching Tiger"" might be better choices."
1,not the right bowl for bob,"so I was very excited about this purchase I wanted a tank that did not look cheap like all of the others, it is for my professional office. the ""light"" on this lamp is the size of a pin head and not changeable so when the light goes you are done. the fish bowl is acrylic and mine came with some sizable scratches in the surface so there are only a few points where I can see through. because the light is very small it only lights up a small part of the bowl and I can only see the fish when he swims through that part. Oh well I tried."
2,Worth the $$ for 'Devil Wind'..the rest is colorless rock,"Bob Welch did some very fine work with Fleetwood Mac, especially on their best non-Buckingham/Nicks album ""Mystery to Me"", but unfortunately on this follow-up disc to ""French Kiss"", Welch seems to have fallen into the sophomore slump. His superstar friends help out, and that provides some much-needed magic(Christine McVie adds her light, lively touch to ""Come Softly"" and Stevie Nicks is in full Gyspy spirit on ""Devil Wind""), but the rest of the songs are heavy and hookless, drawn out and a little dull. There were opportunities here for Welch to break out of the FM radio-rock rut, but with no charisma or showmanship, another ""Sentimental Lady"" fails to materialize."
3,Read all th way to the end of the story!,"This is a weird book. I generally love Carle, but this was a little strange. My daughter is 2 and she was definitely too young for this book, though she did love the flaps, but for myself, the story is just a little odd. It doesn't flow well. Also, I know a number of people who said it was a scary book, it's not, you have to read all the way to the end to see the giant is make believe the whole time. So at least read it all the way through!"
1,Flatland is boring,"Flatland is for advanced students -seniors and up- who are participating in a physchological study class. This book warps your thinking about the geometric rules. Unfortunately, it is written in such a way that even if you are a very concentrated reader, you cannot read a paragraph withouth being distracted. The diction in this story is made to be boring. A teacher assigned freshmen students-in high school- to read this and everyone complained because it literally takes and hour to get through a couple of pages. You must also reread the text to find some sort of meaning. This book is not meant for anyone under 18 and is certainly not enjoyable for leisurely purposes."
3,CLEP Prep,"if your looking for test practice, this is the book for you. but for me at the time i was looking for a more detail explanation, study, and learning instrument. hadn't taken a science class for well over 10 years and was looking for it to be speed taught to me for the exam. luckily i had bought this and another book for the exam....the other book had what i needed and then i just practice taking the exam with this one"
1,I agree- this product was misrepresented!,"I was comparing toy foods. I saw that the shipping info for this toy said it had a shipping weight of 8lbs. I assumed that it would mean that the pieces were heavier and a more solid construction. Little did I know, that you're paying a lot more for the same old plastic food pieces that you see everywhere. I am very disappointed since I paid 29.99 for cheap plastic pieces."
5,Ayaan Hirsi Ali has done again - A Master Piece,"Ayaan Ali brings to light the injust system imposed by Islamiic societies. As Ayaan Ali comes out of the Virgin's cage, she calls out to other Muslim women to stand out for their rights. Ayaan's contribution to ending the degrading treatment of Muslim women is already being felt around the world. Great, insightful reading."
1,culture vs. religion,"please do ur own research and read from reliable people who have proof to what they are saying. any one can claim anything they want and can write anything they want. for instance she says that fgm is in the quran, she should have said in which chapter and what verse (its NOT there!)im not saying that her story is not true...i know that in a lot of countries (muslim and non-muslim) there are horror stories about the treatment of women, but least try to separate culture from religion, the things that happened to her are cultural NOT religious!"
1,Non sense,"This book is non sense. These lady is not Arabic and not Muslim. So, do not let her mislead you. We, Americans, are used to learn from specialists and read only peer reviewed articles by professionals. In the 21st century, you can not believe anything you read without evidence. Generally, I think nobody from any where in the world will be proud and we be bragging with his friends if his daughter lost her virginity !!! We do not need a book for that. If she is proud of her lost virginity, this is her own problem !!!"
1,Shocking,"Shocking, ignorant and completely away from reality. Even the description says how horrible the content is. I wish I never even attempted to read this"
5,Cream of the crop,"I never heard of Joop Wolters til about a week ago. I ran across this album in the People who bought also bought this section. Joop writes highly enjoyable...hmmnnn... what I might call progressive shred with a soul. Nice tunes, wonderful chops and the musicians he plays with are talented and tasty. I played drums for many years and particularly like the incredibly tight performance the drummer turns in. His double bass technique synchronizes beautifully with the tight,enjoyable melodies. If you like it hard, heavy and fast this album will not let you down, but and here's the bonus if you like it lyrical, well performed with nice dynamics and a variety of styles then this album also delivers. For fans of hot guitar, progressive rock and a dash and a half of fusion you won't be disapointed with Joop Wolters in your music library."
4,Where is Recurring Dream?,"I love this compilation, however, am I the only one missing a certain song? From the Tequila Sunrise soundtrack? Which would be ""Recurring Dream""? What gives? I think that exclusion was either a glaring error or on purpose. Maybe there was an issue with film rights or something. Oh well. Enjoy your music without the hangover."
5,An entire CD that is very easy to listen to.,"This CD plays like an easy listening extravaganza. Every song is mellow and classic. The band is apparently from New Zealand/Australia, which may explain the subtle brit pop undertones.. not to mention the McCartney-esque style of a few tracks. Overall this CD is a great buy, you won't be disappointed."
4,life saver,"With two and a half year old twins and being pregnant and unable to move as fast as I used to be able to, I finally ""caved in"" and bought these for my twins. I had always been concerned about what seemed degrading to a child of being on a leash like an animal. However, my girls love these giraffes and are now no longer able to run away in public places, something that's a major safety issue. I do get plenty of looks from people in public when we're out, but I get way more compliments from people at how cute the giraffes are and what a good ldea it is than accusing glances. The reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because the straps, even tightened all the way, are still pretty loose. They do provide enough security to keep the giraffes on and my children safe, but are floppy and fall off one shoulder or the other frequently."
2,Too many dance moves-boring & hard to follow,"I was disappointed with this video. I was all fired up to burn some fat, but this video just didn't get my heart rate up much. There were way too many dance steps and little instruction. I felt like I was doing the cha-cha forever. Also, she didn't cue well from one move to the next."
1,Awful!,"I bought these for use on our Pack n Play changing table and HATED them! The flannel formed little pill-balls all over with the very FIRST washing, and it only got worse, even though I was following the manufacturer's cleaning instructions! I wouldn't even recommend these for use under a crib sheet, due to the poor washability. After only 3 weeks of light use (I rotated several brands), I bagged them up and returned them to the store. The pill-balls had gotten so bad, my baby's clothes seemed to ""cling"" to the pad when I laid him on it! I exchanged them for the BRU brand of quilted and reversible pads, which are so far performing much, much better."
5,"Smart, Open, and Honest","I first came to Geoffrey Brock through Poetry Daily, when they printed ""And Day Brought Back My Night."" I immediately glommed onto the fact that he was a member of the modern Rhyme-and-Meter gang and doing it superbly. I, for one, cannot do it without lapsing into either satire or wannabe-Wordsworth. Not Brock (and several others, including Robert Crawford). This sonnet is so straightforward, so natural, so conversational, so unselfconsciously self-doubting, that the fact that it is an Italian sonnet, conforming to the rules of line, meter, and rhyme, yes, but also the structure of the argument, could easily wisk by without notice in a reading. I immediately sent off for the book and was not disappointed. Here is a writer who lifts the personal to the level of art and, once they're settled, makes them talk to each other openly and honestly -- like friends who once had a big fight, parted company, and have come back together for the sake of the friendship."
2,Somewhat boring,"Granted that these books are meant for a young audience. But as we have seen with Harry Potter, you don't have to disintegrate into such simpering text. This particular book ranks as one of the worst books in this series.Wish that Dave (the one who wrote book number one) could've written the whole series."
4,More Thrills from Barton,"I liked this Barton book even better than High Rise. Perhaps it's the setting, the island paradise of Bermuda with its palm trees, pastel homes, and quaint names. Steve Kerns, aka Dr. Kevin Garrett is a DEA agent who's been put in the witness protection program. He's left behind a wife and three children who have been told he is dead. Kerns, though grieving the loss of his family, falls in love in Bermuda, with the wife of the govenor! Watch out for plot twists as Kerns uncovers a casino enterprise plot involving some high-placed powers in Bermuda and a New York crime boss. Add to that his wife's continued efforts to find out what really happened to him, and you have intriguing parallel plot lines. Ethical dilemmas abound! This story moves fast to a compelling end."
4,WORLDS BETTER THAN THE BBC SESSIONS.,"THE COMMENTS BY REVIEWERS ABOUT THE OVERDUBS ON THIS LIVE MATERIAL ARE NAIVE TO SAY THE LEAST. THIS HAS LONG BEEN A COMMON PRACTICE TO MAKE LIVE PERFORMANCES MORE POLISHED, ALMOST ALL OFICIAL LIVE LP'S USE THE PRACTICE, THE PERFORMANCES OF EXCLUSIVELY BADFINGER MATERIAL ON THIS CD MAKE IT PREFERABLE TO THE BBC SESSIONS WITH THEIR EMPHASIS ON DAVE MASON COVERS. THE CD INCLUDES MANY PERFORMANCES OF SONGS FROM THE OUT OF PRINT AND PAINFULLY UNDERATED ""BUM"" ALBUM, MAKING IT EVEN MORE OF A TREASURE. I'M DEDUCTING A HALF STAR FOR IT BEING TOO SHORT, THERE'S SO MUCH GREAT MATERIAL THAT ISN'T AVAILABLE YET."
3,Mixed Review,"I agree with the other reviewer. If you're using these while stationary they're fine but if you intend to move around a lot they're very painful. God forbid you tab the band while you're wearing them, it's like directly hammering into your eardrum.They effectively block out noise and are fine if you're staying in one spot for short amounts of time."
1,DO NOT BUY THESE!,"Unless you are eager to piss your money away, do not buy these piece-of-crap ear plugs. The ear pods themselves are too soft and shrink up after being exposed to air. The band itself has a weak weld at the midpoint which WILL break after a short time. There is nothing redeeming about these at all."
2,"Good CD,but Return to Innocence is ripped from the Taiwanese","Contrary to popular belief, Return to Innocence is a Taiwanese Ami Tribe song called Kulauwai Divertimento II. This is one of the three parts of the original song. It is usually performed by several senior tribesmen. One person leads then the others follow or improvise. . These chants are not performed by Native American(as stated in the printed intro), but rather by Taiwanese aborigines. But none the less, it is a descent CD with one ripped off song. But not as good as the live proformance by the"
3,Interesting but not Original,"I am Amazed that Enigma does not give credit to Klaus Schulze (the godfather of electronic music) or Pink Floyd (the godfathers of sykedelyk music) in most of their compositions. It's a well thought copy band of the 70's with a 90's flair into trance. Oh well, no wonder there are 260 sellers at 1 cent each."
5,"this is the best cd I have herd for a long time,","I love this d it is so cool and I will get it as soon as i can.I love the sond of this you did a great job keep up the good music.,"
3,"Pretty Darn Good, Minus the New Age-isms","The music for the Matrix Trailer and Return to Innocence are powerful, moving, and standout. Overall an excellent CD which avoids 1 of the 2 major traps that 'New Age' music tends to suffer from, that being 'relaxing' to the point of being mournful or bland.On the other hand, this CD does fall into the second trap, that of the New Age song cliche. References to opressed Native Americans, dolphins, crystals, the pacifistic ideals...and a truly annoying track called 'Out from the Deep' which deserves to be scratched from an otherwise marvelous album.Taken as a whole, you'll like this CD (as I did, for most of it)if you like Enya, Celtic Music, Pink Floyd, or if you share a kinship with the first reviewer of this CD, 'Athena Sunwolf'. (Just love that New Age name!)"
3,Much Better than the last one but that guys voice.........,"If the guy didn't sing the CD would be perfect! His voice is like fingernails on a chalkboard, but the rest of the songs he isn't in are great! Nothing is as good as MCMXC A.D. !! But this one is worth buying used. It still has some good songs on it."
1,Garage item,I thought I was buying a refurbished item but was just buying a used phone. It still had the previous persons greeting. It shot craps two months after purchase. I expect Ebay items to be used not Amazon items but now I know and 30 bucks is a relatively cheap lesson.
1,Mythic should have a couple servers without TOA,"Before TOA I would give this game a 4.5 star rating, after TOA released I will give it 0.5 stars. It would be nice if Mythic added a couple non TOA servers. I have five level 50 characters that I will not play much longer after my account expires. Since TOA released, the winner in RVR is not the best fighters, the winner is who has the most TOA artifacts. IMO took all the fun away from RvR. I would not suggest buying this game."
2,Mamet strikes out,"This is a beautifully filmed and well acted waste of time. The problem is with the script: it falters about half way through and in the end dies completely. The film is not, as advertised, a comedy. It's a fantasy about Chicago mobsters and a shoe shine man (Don Ameche) who is little livelier and more interesting than a scarecrow. The story is so poorly done that at one point the main gangster character steals a car by hot wiring it to take him and the scarecrow from Lake Tahoe to Chicago. Along the way they stop at a gas station, and there are now keys in the car, which are taken by an attendant in lieu of payment. Apparently hours later, the two men are back in Chicago. This after the gangster had left his jacket behind with the airline tickets. The worst part is the utterly absurd ending. I can imagine even art theater audiences, devoted to Mamet and ""fillum,"" groaning if not booing."
2,"I'm a Mamet fan, but this is probably his worst.","I gave this movie every chance, but the story is slow,the acting is liveless (Ameche is the only one half-waydecent), and the story turns out pointless. The ending doesn'treally make any sense or have any impact, and the vaguenessand indirection that is usually explained at some later pointin Mamet's films is never clarified here.Only watch if you're a die-hard Mamet fan so you can say at a dinner party, ""Yes, I saw that one, and I agree it was bad""."
1,klh ha7000,"The unit work fine for first 7 months. Then if I switch on the power indicator was coming little late. After a week, it stuck in the welcome screen and stop responding completely. So do not buy this.If any of you have the same issue please share the idea and solution for this.Icopied the above review- only change was his lasted 6 mos- mine 7-"
4,A must see for Halloween,Fascinating adaptation of the classic tale of Snow White. Laced with the right amount of horror and fantasy to be enjoyed during Halloween.
5,A Perfect Day for Salinger,"Even after decades, this is still appealing to people of all ages. I'm a teenager and I have always been more interested in reading more modern-day novels and short stories, but J.D. Salinger is among one of the few exceptions I have been willing to broaden my horizons for. ""A Perfect Day for Bananafish"" is by far my favorite of all the nine stories. There is a part where this little girl is talking to Seymour and she is wearing a canary-yellow swimsuit. Seymour commented on it, saying, ""I've always loved that color of blue on a bathing suit,"" and the little girl responded with, ""This is yellow!"" and Seymour said, ""So it is."" Eeek! The little things like that are what make me love Salinger and his writing so very much. Sorry that this was not much of a review with a plot summary or anything, but trust me, read this and you'll love it!!!"
2,None of these stories were of interest to me,"I like a wide variety of authors and types of books. Truthfully, this is the fIrst I have read of J.P.Salinger's books so it may just be the author's style of writing does not appeal to me."
3,A pretty good read,"This book was alright but a lot of people dont seem to understand that in Pretty Mouth and Green My Eyes that the guys wife is cheating on him with the friend that hes talking to on the phone. Shes the girl on the bed. See, the irony is that this poor guys been bleeding out his heart to his friend and his friend is sleeping with his wife.Thats why he wont let him come over to talk and why he is surprised when the guy calls back again and tells him that his wife came home.The poor guy is either very seriously deluding himself or he just wants to keep on pretending that everything is ok and he resents himself for spilling his feelings out to someone so hes going to try and repress them again. That was a good story but it wasnt half as good as a Perfect Day for Bananna Fish"
4,Nice story but was missing something...,"I liked the story the Exorcist. However, I wasn't as enthusiastic about this book as I was with the Omen (another horror novel of comparable size & content written in the same decade). Of course, the book was better than the movie and much better than some of the LONGER horror novels to hit the shelves. I've always been a believer of better quality rather than more quantity. In that respect, the book really delivers."
4,Great Popular Horror/Detective/Psychological Thriller,"1. Read it in one night, 2. Would have been 5 stars except writing sometimes cliche, dialogue sometimes unrealistic 3. Face it: movies and books can't be compared (apples and oranges), both will (or should) scare the crap out of you."
5,A Question of Faith,"A second reading of ""The Exorcist"" nearly 25 years after a first reading packs an even more gut-wrenching wallop! The sheer terror of supernatural evil glutches its victimized reader by the throat the first time around but rips him apart the second time around. Slightly beneath its surface of absolute horror, ""The Exorcist"" is a supernatural detective thriller. At its heart, though, it is really a challenge of faith that brings the question outside the realm of the supernatural and lays it on the doorstep of the conscience. There, on the threshhold of our own existence, we are commanded to validate our own divinity and measure its strength against the challenge of evil. Whether intentionally or not, Blatty challenges his reader to stand against more than terror: he challenges us to stand against our own demons."
3,It was pretty cool,I thought that this book had a lot to offer. it was full of impact and action. It made you expect the unexpected in the perspective that you never saw what was coming.
2,Did i read the right book,"I am in shock. if this is supposed to be the best hooror novel ever written we must be used to reading some weak stories. i have always wanted to read this book and looked forward to it, ater all my own mother threw her copy out of the window in fear but it was so lame. Most of it had nothing to do with Reagan and was concentrating on Detective Kinderman trying to solve the murder and Karls drugged up daughter. Nothing about it scared me and i appreciate that as i read it in just over 1 day some of it may have been lost on me but the ending was very rushed and left us with many questions. Nothing even made me think reagan was anything more than a disturbed child and i am perplexed at how it has been so popular over the years. If the book is better than the film then the film must be awful."
3,This an excellent book on demonic possession.,"I am 15 years old and I do not believe in the paranormal. In order to read this book, you must have beliefs of demons and the devil or otherwise it is not a good scare. I read the book several years ago and saw the movie soon after. The book was much more difficult to follow because of the advanced medical terms used throughout. I would not recommend this book to anyone under the age of 18 because of the profanity and vulgarity."
3,"horrifying, but not scary enough","this book is almost has horrifying as the movie. to see it in person, can't even compare to reading it, but the fright is still present. the author william peter blatty, definetly has a lot of experience with devil warship is my guess, since the book is discriptive of ruthless and unusal acts, that the movie features. anyway while playing with a wegie board [spelling is probably wrong ha ha] young raegon, becomes possessed by the devil spirt and strange accurences happen. she can spin her head around in a full circle, and her ruthless bashing to god is absolutely unheard of. the book is deeply religous, since the path of the book follows along roman catholic church, into catholic times and through hell and coming face to face with the devil. u really should stick to the movie though, because in this case, the movie is better then the book."
1,an anti-Catholic fantasy trivializing actual Catholic Exorcism,"Peter Blatty in my opinion, sold his pretend-fantasy about Exorcism, describing such in ways that dont even come close to the reality of Exorcism, which is profound and real in the Church. He sells out Catholic Church teachings about exorcism by making trivial and shallow assertions about it all. The church doesnt revolve around a guy who didnt make his hash marks as a writer with his one effort... it was the film maker who put the fantasy of 'exorcist' into pop culture, and the film is different than the book and shows true genius in film making. Regarding Blatty's writings trivializing exorcism, his book cant be put ahead of the real Christ that the real Church revolves around solely. In that way, the Exorcist book is uninformed and inaccurate in its ""facts"" about exorcism. The book is entertainment, but not in any way a serious portrayal of what is."
5,Old but in good shape,The feeder tape is sticky but after it move it the sound is that find and I give 6 stars!
5,Absolutely brilliant!,"Bob Brookmeyer is simply the finest composer working in jazz today. His understanding of form, orchestration, harmony, and improvisation is unmatched. This is essential listening!"
2,Misses some opportunities to be better,"I bought this laptop for my 4 1/2-year-old based on Amazon reviews by other parents with children this age saying it was great. It certainly has its moments, but I would add the caveat, so long as you are sitting at your child's elbow. It's hard to imagine a child playing with it independently, while still young enough for it to be called ""educational"". Simple touches, like arranging the activities so that the easiest ones appear first, would have helped a lot. But they appear to be in semi-random order, and I am left wandering through a cumbersome interface searching for things that it's possible for her to play. If you have a child who will let you hang over their shoulder (which my daughter, strong-willed and independent, doesn't always tolerate), and are willing to burn about half of their playtime dealing with poor design instead of playing, then there's some educational benefit to be gleaned in the end."
5,Love this movie,I love this movie its really interesting even though I am way past my teens I still enjoy this movie
4,GREAT toy! My daughters LOVE it!,"My daughters play with this talking tea set ALL the time! The tops of the lids can break off with any 'rough' play, but they really are very durable. In fact, one of their friends decided to pour real water in the hole on the top of the teapot and after waiting a couple weeks for the residual water to dry out, it worked perfectly again! Doesn't need batteries changed very frequently either and not ridiculously loud. -Two definite pluses for parents!!"
3,Great sound -- but uncomfortable to hold,"Just purchased this phone after reading the reviews. Sound quality is excellent; alas, the feel of the phone itself is not. The layout of the keypad is dazzlingly high tech, but decidedly confusing. For example, rarely-used functions have a big center key, while the all-important ""talk"" button is off to the side and too small for the job. But all this I could live with. The real problem is that the shape of the handset is wrong -- it is straight and rigid (hard plastic), and gets very uncomfortable held up to the ear for calls of more than a few minutes. In the end, we sent ours back, and have opted for the Sanyo CLT-937A instead."
1,"Obvious Copy of ""Brave New World""/ ""We""","The themes of this book are obviously inspired (copied) from the 1946 novel ""Brave New World"" by Aldous Huxley, which itself is claimed to be inspired by the 1921 book ""We"" by Yevgeny Zamyatin. Pulp fiction version, I guess. Not revolutionary or original, commercial. Movie was cool. Entertaining."
5,Doesn't get more bizarre than this,"Ok...most people over 30 (ironically) have seen ""Logan's Run"", and basically know what it's about.Now picture this...there are no domes, and the life expectancy of the citizens is 21. There is no carrousel, people just have to show up to the local 7-11 on the last day of their lives to die. Logan (3, not 5) visits a drug clinic (the opposite of what you're thinking of), a brothel made of glass, and a ""fire gallery"". To get the book started, Logan meets his contact at sort of a party for peeping toms.Sound bizarre? You're right, it is kinda strange, and it reads like it was written over a weekend. But it's compelling enough to option a script, and you can imagine how many rewrites it suffered to get to the screen.Keep running, Logan."
3,Have they added passing to pinochle yet?,"I have Hoyle Card Games 5, and enjoy it, but the Pinochle implementation does not include passing cards. That's the only reason I see to upgrade, so it would be a waste of money if it doesn't add that...Update: I recently inquired on the Hoyle forums, and the response was that Hoyle games follow Hoyle's Book of Rules and passing isn't in there, so it won't be in the game. I think they need to update their book, as everyone I know passes cards in pinochle, but there you have it..."
3,Very cute but flimsy,"I bought this for my dog (who is a size small), unfortunately she hated it. It was very cute for the amount of time I was able to get her to not shake it off.Though I must say, the connection of the buns and ketchup was kind of flimsy, moved around a lot and couldn't stay put even for the short amount of time my dog had it on."
3,Percy Sledge,"It's not quite the songs I expected, but I am able to listen the him and someof the songs were OK, but not all songs suited me. Would not recommend this assome of his favorites, but if you like Sledge a lot, you could try it."
3,Not as good as I thought,"I expected a bit more from this movie. The camera work was nice, but there's only so many slow zooms/pans I can take before I start wondering if there's anything else to the film. The acting was pretty good and I enjoyed the european feel, which I admire more and more with every low budget foreign film I check out. However, the pacing was way too slow, and 45 minutes into the movie my girlfriend starts giving me dirty looks for renting another obscure horror dud. When the zombie action begins, it begins in a big way, and the last half hour doesn't disappoint. It's a shame one has to wait so long to get to the violence and bloodshed expected from this type of film. Despite above-average acting and special effects, this movie is more of a sleeping pill than the all-out zombie massacre I expected."
2,"Last 10 minutes are great, but the whole movie is boring...","This movie's only real high point is the last 10 minutes or so. For the most part, it ""tries"" to be a ""real"" movie by holding off the major zombie scenes until near the end and throwing in an investigation plot (whiich totally blow). While the make-up and gore are pretty good, I would say rent it first before buying it (mind you. I am a hardcore zombie movie fan, so I bought it anyway)."
2,Torture,"No, I don't own this cd. I had the extreme misfortune of attending a party for airline employees (Daisy (my date at the time) coerced me) and you guessed it, they were playing this cd. Unfortunately, they weren't serving drinks quickly enough and I got a good, sober listen to this one. It's mawkish, boring, and dated. Do yourself a favor, don't buy this cd and avoid parties where they play this kind of music."
1,WTF?,"I love Jeff Berlin, Dennis Chambers, and T Lavitz, but I have to say in my opinion this is one of the worst CD's I ever heard! If I hadn't known who was playing on it I could never have guessed by the playing. I am a huge Jeff Berlin fan and also like Chambers and Lavitz, but this is nothing like I have heard. I have an open mind to new music but this is just not good. The guitarist sounded like he went to study with John McLaughlin and forgot his way to the lessons. Dennis Chambers could very well been replaced by a drum machine. T Lavitz sounded like random noise, and Berlin had a great bass tone, but played with absolutely no feeling. This music CD will be relagated to the back of my collection never to be played again. It should have never been released commercially. Being a musician myself I reiterate that I admire all of these players (except the guitarist, ehhhhh!) but if you enjoy these players don't buy this!"
5,Works great,"Haven't had any issues with it. First day I received it, I went out and took 400 some photos and still wasn't full. Perfect size for me."
4,Plenty fast,"I got this as part of a starter kit for a Canon 30D; there's no lag with the fast shooting mode (5 fps I think) ; reviewing images on the camera is nearly instantaneous; there is a 1 to 2 second lag when going from the latest image straight to the very first one on the card.I'm one of those people who want things ""now!"" and this is great; I'm sure there are newer, faster cards out there, but the price is even better than when I bought it; you may want to have several smaller, hopefully more reliable cards than a big fast one, the odds are better that the smaller ones won't all fail *at the same time*...My Adorama invoice says ""60x"" so I guess that's the max speed, compared to others going at 133x, 200x and faster... But again, this is plenty fast... Hope this helps."
4,Almost need more,"I purchased this card for my Rebel xti thinking that the card would be sufficiant, well i was wrong. I guess for most people a 2.0 is enough but if you shoot in a higher quality format and you take alot of pictures you should then look at a 4.0. Overall it's a memory card and it worked as it said it would."
1,"Went corrupt after only about 1,000 pictures!","I was very disappointed in this card. It worked OK at the start, but with no warning, suddenly became corrupted after only about 1,000 photos. I thought I was getting a good deal, but now have gone out and bought a more expensive brand. Losing photos isn't worth the savings."
1,Disgruntled,I paid an extra $17. to get it here in 1 day but it took 2 days and came at 7 p.m. on the second day. I was very unhappy. Then when I put it in the camera it said I had 000 pictures available. It won't work at all. I would like to send it back but can't figure out a way to do it. The website says returning is simple but I don't see where it says how to do it. I thought the price was too good to be true.
1,Original price is totally misleading.,"The item here is a slow (100 speed,15mb/s) small (2GB) CF card and it's not even UDMA, but the ""original price"" is $99. Baloney! Look around, there are faster cards with more capacity for a few dollars more, even here on Amazon. Uberi seems to be the problem in this, they have a lot of listings with ""big discounts"" but to me, is does not look right at all."
4,SanDisk 2G Ultra,"I found it to hold a lot of pictures, but it malfunctioned once, and I lost a whole day's worth of pictures. I had been in Europe on a once in a lifetime trip, and was disappointed. To be fair, it could have been battery problems (batteries were not purchased at Amazon.com). Hope that helps."
5,Great memory for my Nikon D70S + D200,"I'm very pleased with the price/performance of these cards, and have not had any card crashes with this brand. My Nikon D70S writes very quickly to this card, and haven't noticed any delays when shooting successive frames. And, based on testing I have read, this CF card should work well for my shooting style with my new D200. I would also recommend the SandDisk SDDR-92 (USB 2.0) card reader, which is very easy to use, and features great software for one-click file transfers. This card is a great value for the money, and Amazon offers a very competitive price."
4,Very Very Good,"When I heard the single ""Lulling Us to Sleep"" which is from this album, it blew me away. It's tough stuff pop and darn worth the money. Then I bought the album. Let me first say this album is very very good. The production values need a little work in my opinion. Some of the songs sound ""muddy"" and you have to concentrate on picking out the melodies or even vocals on a couple of the tracks. (This is a minor complaint, trust me) I highly recommend this CD. 85% of the tracks on this CD are HUGE gems. I do have one question though? The title of the album is directly from a bible verse that implys LOTS and LOTS of judgement, Yet the notes on the album sleeve and some of the lyrics imply ""judge not"". Is this a mixed message or what!!I'm not sure the artist understands the overall message he is sending, esp with the album title.Regarless of these elements, in which YES I have been rather picky, this IS an Excellent CD, A must have. I just hope to have given people some food for thought!Dan"
1,What were they smoking?,I wish i could give this game negative stars that is how poorly the makers did with this. i can help but wonder if they just decided to scrap production and rush the release with this mess of a program they call a game... Save your money like the last guy said and play lords of the realm 2. verry dissapointed and verry frustraited. i waited months for this release and what a let down. all you do is move a man here or there and thats is about it. no building no real managing nothing but an occasional battle. well let me tell you the battles in lords 2 are far more better than the mess in 3 sorly dissapointed. i think they should have paid me to buy that game
2,Not as expected,The game is basically boring unless you have a photogenic memory for all of the vassals and their powers. It moves too slow. Very disappointing.
1,Not worth even one star,"This is the wrst game ever. Over the last few years Sierra has really disappointed me by not producing any decent startegy game. Instead, we get this P.O.S. that barely lets you make any decisions. In the least, LOR III should have improved AI and graphics of LOR II.20$ price should have been a dead give away, I bought it anyway. 20 minutes later I threw it away, it was just that awful."
1,Worst Game EVER!,"As a long time gamer I must say that this is the epitome of a mediocre game. Bad graphics, bad gameplay, bad all. I looked forward to a Stronghold-like experience, where you got to build up your caste, instead, you get to ""upgrade your caste"" what the heck? this must be the single worst sim-game I have ever played.I read their forums. Everyone there was concerned about the announced price. It was supposedly a new ""marketing"" strategy, but its just a blunder dressed up with a tie.(...)NOT WORTH YOUR TIMENOT WORTH THE DRIVE TO YOUR GAME RETAIL STOREDONT BUY IT, PERIOD."
1,I want my money back.,"I didn't buy this game through Amazon - Maybe if I had looked here first I would have seen all the terrible reviews and saved myself $20.00. The graphics are the only improvement over Lords II, and as has been stated by others, they're still below par.Here I was, oh-boy all excited to play the next Lords Of The Realm game, and boy-oh-god what a dissapointment. Really, Sierra, how can you justify releasing a game in the Lords franchise that mocks everything that was good about its predecessor?I want my money back. I want my money, and the 2 hours I spent trying to get into the game. I suppose if I complain enough I might get the money back, but that two hours is gone. Forever."
1,WHY MUST STUPID PEOPLE RATE A GAME NOT OUT,"THIS IS TOWARD Pierre, games not out and you give it a five star rating.PLEAAAAASSSSEEE!!!!. Get the real deal not a beta version before rating, and dont rate it off of old games."
4,Can't Complain For The Price,"Hey, it does what its supposed to do. I have used this for a month and a half now with no problems. Yeah, the cord could be a little longer. I am thrilled that I found this one on Amazon instead of forking over $30+ for a new charger at the Sprint store."
3,ok,this item is ok my hamster does not know what to do in there and im afraid there is not enough air for her in it. This item is a rather large toy . and it just sits there not much for hamster to do but run in circles
1,Wheel exploded/fingers amputated!!!,Tire on this wagon inadvertently over inflated and chinese-mad wheel exploded severing tips of three fingers and complete severance of radial artery in right arm. My client nearly bled to death. Buy a cart with non-pneumatic tires!!!
2,Eureka! They've lost it!,"Seasons 1 through 3 were quite entertaining, so what happened to season 4? The writing is poorer, the acting is poorer, the directing is poorer, the cinamatography is poorer, ... Well, you get the idea. Each episode presents the viewer with a significant step backward well past mediocrity. By the time we reach the second ""Christmas Special,"" complete with its horrendous special effects and multiple forms of poorly executed animation, I felt like I had received a complete frontal lobotomy."
2,Missing Episodes,"If you're hoping to catch up to the series that began on 7/11/2011, you will be very disapointed. The last 3 episode that tie up last season to this are missing. Doesn't make a lot of sense. Love the show though..."
5,Good Start,"Nice book to introduce French to young one. Daughter is six, and she enjoys it. We have been playing more with the language, and this book is a freindly intro to more advanced textbooks."
5,"An excellent, readable history of the Corvette","This book covers the the car, and the people behind the car. Excellent reading about the automotive industry. Sure to please any auto enthusiast.It also covers models, options, serial numbers, production volumes and trivia."
5,Not so old...,"Indeed, if Empire Earth is currently an old game, it is always very easy and fun. Another good point is the multiplayers parts which permit doing very funny times."
5,Jack Hayford Never Disappoints You,"Pastor-Teacher Jack Hayford's teachings are so accurate and inspired that they never disappoint the reader who is hungry for a living God. Brother Jack lives on a fresh anointing every day and it is to our benefit to be able to absorb it on a daily basis. It is easy enough to understand to the comparative beginner, but challenging enough to make the reader hungry after more manna tomorrow. I am grateful to the Spirit Filled Bible, so much so that I felt compelled to give my most recent edition to a young soldier going off to war in Afghanistan for a 3 year tour. both are great publications to study and to share."
1,This toy should be sold in the dollar store,"We bought this toy for our son who will be three in January. We also got the construction set. This has got to be the cheapest toy I have ever purchased. Dollar store toys have better toys then this. It is so flimsy! My son tries to roll the fire engine down the ramp and it breaks and falls over. I want to take this toy back, but SANTA already threw the boxes out. It took my husband and his brother forever to put this together. The thing falls a part all the time. I cannot believe little tikes would sell something so poorly made. Save your money and Do not buy this."
1,Actually less than 1 star,"Opened fresh out of the bag, scanned just as advertised, but did not detect my 801.1g signal even when placed next to the wireless router. It's only an expensive key fob with lights."
4,"UNIQUE, WEIRD BUT AMAZING AT THE SAME TIME","I watched this movie out of curiousity, based on the reviews I've read onlines and based on the trailer I saw online somewhere. I can say that it is unique, weird, a bit scary and confusing, but at the same time, amazing story-telling. Nice overall."
3,Neil Gaiman Meets The Matrix,"Since everyone else appears to either love or hate this movie, I will give an indifferent opinion.Loads of spoilers now follow ...Intriguing at times, but sorry ending. Too many loose ties, but I loved music score, the cheap effects (were well done), the fact that it mostly tried to be original and the little girl Emma was cute.What was the purpose of the storyteller .. I missed something there? That Ink was the girls father .. good, but the connection between the father being with the girl in a coma and the girl in the 'dream' and both having to save her at the same time, even though time operates differently .. very tenuous. Why was the girl so important to everyone? How come all the fantasy figures had superhuman fighting powers? And so on.In summary, worth the time to watch, but not well thought out script.3 and 1/2 stars."
5,Fantastic!,"Beautiful, original, touching. An excellent story well told, with instantly lovable characters. A mind bender in the style of ""Dark City"" and ""Nine""."
3,Mr. Throat Warbler Mangrove,"That was the main thought running through my head while I watched this film. It's not a bad movie; certainly imaginative, and definitely filled with passion and serious purpose. However I found the story's loopiness to be distracting, and the messages the film contained came at you with about as much subtlety as a water-balloon attack by the neighbor kids. It's a good effort, and I imagine that the director will go places with a bigger budget and a better editor, but as a fantasy film it cribs more ideas than it develops, and I just found the characters to be more tedious than compelling."
2,Too big need sizes on amazon site,"Nowhere on your site did it give the dimensions of this disc. Consequently, the two that I ordered were too big for my dog and it isnot worth paying for shipping it back. Luckily, I ordered one of the smaller ones so we can play with my dog until she gets too many bite marks on it. My bad."
1,This isn't music,This cd is one of the most terrible things that I have ever listened to. Their lyrics suck and the beats suck. I'd much rather listen to NSYNC than this garbage!!! These guys need to get some talent and release a cd that is worthy of listening to.
2,well not much,this cd is kinda of a dissapointment.I am a huge eminemfan so this might not come to many people as a suprisebut just becous eminem hates somebody dose not mean i haveto right.i mean i can relate to this cd but then i can relate to eminem music more.i am not putting icp down i kindalike them.but just to be safe i would reccomend an eminem or d12 cd i mean even dr.dre 50 cent gunit thats me.
2,Why are you wondering about this CD.,"Why are you wondering about this CD. Sure there are some good songs on it. But how many, two, three, if that. Sure Bowling Balls is good. But that's why it's the single. The DVD has some good stuff but not much at all. The other ICP CDs are a lot better and funnier than this one. This one just tries too hard to be wicked and violent. I recommend picking up other ICP CDs before this one, including The Wraith: Shangri=La and the Forgotten Freshness CDs. Which isn't saying much for this CD. You'd be much better off staying away from these Detroit clowns from here on out. That is until they release a greatest hits CD, which doesn't seem far away based on how well their CDs sell now. But just know if you do buy this CD, I warned you ahead of time. So when you come wanting your money back, stay away from me. I warned you about this CD, but you obviously didn't listen. Hopefully ICP will become good again, because this CD is just bad."
3,Good But Not Great,"Most of the songs are OK, and the performances are good. However, it lacks the pizzazz and fire of most of Billy Cobham's work, at least the ones I have heard. It just isn't that exciting as the others have been."
4,great toy for disabled girls,great toy for disabled girls- my daughter is in a wheelchair. This toy gives her a sense of normalcy for the brief time she plays with it
5,Got me a job!,"I am about to graduate from New Mexico State University with a BS in Marketing. I bought this book, followed the directions, and I landed a cool job that I start right after graduation. The biggest thing I got out of it was how to approach interviews and sell myself to the interviewer."
4,Get this while you can ...,"'cuz it looks like it's disappearing.This is much in the style of E-L-B, following a path Le began in '89 with Miracles. (He has other, slightly more experimental efforts out there)If contemporary jazz guitar matters to you, Nguyn L will find favor in your collection. Even more so if you favor trios.If you don't have any of his releases, this is a good place to start. If you do, they you'll enjoy this one as well."
4,dranzer,hi i put 4 stars for fun becuase its relly fun exept that if u play with alot u might get a littel bored of it bythewayit is good becuase it raises ur blades attack def endu by 2 stars so my team 4 members we used to lose alot we only won 3 times and in the turnment we only won 7th place after that we made a new blads.every week we by a new beybladeand now our total blades are 12 so we costmized them andmade 4 blades out of them and we bought this luncher AND NOWWE NEVER LOST AFTER THAT DAY INFECT WE WILL NEVER LOSE AGAINSO IF U WANT PLAY AGANST US THE THE SHARP BLADERS COME TO LIVERPOOL STREET IN VIRGENIA ZIPCODE 22315 IF U NEVER LOST BEFORE COME BATTEL US.
1,Terribly Disturbing and Misleading to God's Truth,"Please use extreme discernment and wisdom in reading this book. It comes from an extreme Calvanistic point of view and although there are many good lessons to be learned from the studied scriptures, they are primarily based from a wrong foundation and on OPINION. If you are one who practices calvanism, then this is the book for you but from a Christian foundational standpoint, it is misleading and false. Just because someone says they are a Christian and writes a book based on scripture does not make it true. Be careful what you read! The only true author is God himself!!Kristine Simon"
4,For Fans Only,"This book is not a good introduction to Grace Brothers for the uninitiated. I enjoyed the stories very much, but I had long ago memorized every episode of the BBC series on which they were based. The stories differed in dialogue and small plot points with the episodes on which they were based, and it was those differences that kept me reading.Are You Being Served was genius because of its writing and the talents of the actors and actresses. In the written medium, only the former comes through, and without the timing of actors' execution, it seems a little wooden. Still, if you can supply their voices in your head, you'll probably enjoy it."
3,Not crazy about these HI-cut briefs.,"These are very, very thin and I will not purchase them again. Not worth the money, nor the price to mail them back."
4,A Different Sound for Hal,"This CD is somewhat of a different sound for Hal - but a good different. From what I understand, this is the first record that he produced himself. It is somewhat of a break from his previous music, but I like the direction that his music seems to be going. There are a few upbeat numbers on this CD, but for the most part, the music is a little more mellow and heartfelt. I really don't understand why Hal doesn't get more radio play - he has been one of my favorite country artists for over a decade now.Take a listen - I don't think you'll be disappointed!"
5,No bad songs.,"I enjoy almost all his music and this CD is no exception. Lots of energy, and his great voice."
2,Taste yucky,"Inexpensive and healthy but yucky ""whole grain"" tassting I wouldmt buy them again I want ones that taste like bread"
4,a great ending to a great series,"""Kim Possible: So The Drama"" is the finale to the Disney Channel's Emmy nominated series, ""Kim Possible"". The movie, much like the series it concludes, is smart, well-paced and written. The plot revolves around the heroic redhead Kim and her goofy sidekick Ron thwarting the evil Dr. Drakken and his assistant Shego, with a interesting subplot involving Ron developing feelings for Kim, and Kim's own romantic involvement with the new guy in town, Erik. However, Erik is not all he seems, and Ron must look past his own reservations to save his best friend. The action sequences are interesting and well thought out, the film's opening sequence in Tokyo a prime example. The romance subplot is also engaging, as longtime fans of the series will be happy to see the two young heroes finally expressing their love for each other. The film lends itself well to viewers of all ages, and is easy to recommend to the young, or the young at heart."
5,Vegan awesomeness,"Luna bars are delicious! And full of vitamins! And vegan! This is the second 15-pack I buy because I love them so much. I like the fact I can eat all of them without the worry of animal products or gaining weight. I buy other flavors as well to alternate, although white macadamia is my favorite! They're good to have any time of the day, I personally bought them because I stay up late often but didn't want to get fat with having calorie-rich midnight snacks."
3,Great Snack!,When you are trying to lose weight you constantly need snacks on hand. Luna Bars are one of the best. Cookies and cream are pretty good but my favorite are the Chocolate peppermint!
4,Luna Bars,"The order came in on a timely maner, the product is good and a good to go snack, useful for to put it on your lunch bag and just to be a carried as a healthy candy snak"
5,Yum.,"These are so delicious and hard to find in stores. They make a really good healthy substitute for dessert. My 8 year old daughter loves them and even my husband was eating them until we informed him that they are for ""women""."
2,Luna Bar Lemon Zest New Recipe Stinks!,Luna Bar decided to change the recipe for the Lemon Zest Bars. They are way less lemony - much more oily. Very disappointed in the change - were way better before.
2,Decent Product - Bad Delivery,"This is a product that I normally buy in my grocery store, so I know what fresh ones taste like. The ones delivered by Amazon.com were dry and broken up in pieces.This has never been my experience with other products from Amazon...."
5,safety snack,"Maybe a little too decadent, but it's got no refined sugar and is mostly organic. Great if you have blood sugar issues and also if you need to avoid eating on impulse (other more unhealthy things). I love all the Clif products."
1,Hexane,"Okay so I was loving Luna bars and eating them almost daily until I came across an article about the process of extracting soy protein isolate. Apparently, in this process a chemical called hexane is used which is a known neurotoxin. Unless the ingredients specifically state that it is organic then the soy protein isolate is most likely extracted using this chemical. I was eating these bars because I thought they were a great nutrition bar, but no longer. There is a list online entitled ""Guide to hexane-extracted soy in nutrition bars"" by the Cornucopia institute which rates these types of bars. Luna Bars are rated with a skull and crossbones. Lovely. I have written an inquiry to the company in order verify this information but they will not contact me back. I advise any eating Luna bars to consider this information and do some research. I personally do not want any extra chemicals in my body!"
3,"Good product, great price, but not so great packaging","I love Luna bars and for the price, these are great! My only complaint is the condition in which I received them. The outer shipping box was fine, but the actual box with the Luna bars was open and 2 of the bars had blue ink all over the front of the wrapper."
1,Not good for a Luna Bar,This is one of the worst Luna Bars I've tasted. The flavor is more like grape than raspberry. No almond flavor at all. Would not purchase again.
3,Toasted Nuts 'n' Cranberry - Edible But Nothing to Write Home About,"I tried the Toasted Nuts 'n' Cranberry flavor and was dissapointed. The taste is rather bland and tastes like what you might think of when you think of a health food bar. Hopefully I can find other people on camping, hiking, biking and skiing trips who like these things cause it will take me forever to eat them.On the other hand, I've tried a bunch of the Clif bars and they've all been awesome. If you are looking for good tasting snack bars for your outdoor adventures or just something to tide you over during the day go with Clif Bars & skip the Luna Bars or at least the Toasted Nuts 'n' Cranberry flavor."
4,A little too sweet,"I am a big fan of the Luna line of bars, and I love Cookies 'n' Cream ice cream, so I thought I would love these bars. However, I found them to be a bit too sweet for my tastes as a breakfast bar, which is how I usually eat them. The quality is up to Luna standards, but just a bit too sweet for me."
3,product ok,product reminded me a lot of a rice crispy treat with chocolate on one side. it tasted ok but I will be looking for a bar that is more filling and more protein in it
4,Cold UP DISCO!!!!,"Crown Heights Affair was one of the many elite bands of the 70's ,but they along with BT Express & Brass Construction,put down serious horn sessions along with heavy funk bass to drive their music to the top of R&B charts consistently. The 1st cut ""Dancin'"" will make you do just that-put it on at the next cook-out! My favorite is ""Far Out"", a supurb instrumental with tight vocal harmonics that still kicks after 29 years. Their music still has flow & would blow the current R&B out the water!I highly recommend that you pick this one up just to remind yourself of those 10 glorious years when the best music ever was recorded and feast on the giftings of one of the decade's best groups. You'll be glad you did!!!"
2,Needs editing,"Rodengen's facts are accurate and interesting, but I find the style of connected magazine articles to give too much redundancy. Background that was necessary for each magazine article is included over and over again in this book. The same point could be delivered with a book 60% to 70% the size. A lot of interesting information especially if you know little or nothing on this subject."
3,Half Road Trip Half Boredom,"Half of this book details the planning process of the road trip which is far from a rip roaring laugh out loud time. The road trip part of the book is somewhat interesting and there are a few good laugh out loud parts. It appears that Cahill was contracted to write a book and found out that he didn't have enough material from the road trip so he had to fill it with the thrilling money raising and visa application process. The ending is the classic ""need to get this finished before deadline"" and the last 3000? miles are glossed over in five pages. I like Cahill's writing style but this book is definitely lacking interesting material for him to use."
5,Where's Furry Fury?,"A wonderful telling of how two roto documentaros travel from the tip of Tierra del Fuego to the North Coast of Alaska while battling time, the elements, gasoline bandits, leftist revolutionaries, pit searches, PR men and the dangers of sparkling water based instant coffee. The surreal scene of the impromptu press conference in Quito, Ecuador, with our intrepid author fielding questions while Garry is busying promising death for the mechanic who modified the electrical system on the truck, is worth the price of admission. I'm only disappointed to see that Mr. Cahill has yet to finish the sure-fire bestseller Furry Fury which he gives a sypnosis for early in the book."
5,Road Fever - Tim Cahill,"This is one of the most hilarious books I've ever read. I read it three times in Dutch (my mothertongue)over the last 5 years and now I'm almost done reading it in English, and it cracks me up every time again. Having travelled through South-America and the fact that I've lived in Latin America now for 5 years, helps to understand the typical anecdotes Cahill discribes. Everybody who's been in Latin America and loves travel, MUST read this book."
3,Mostly boring with a few laughs,"I expected a lot out of this book, and maybe that is why I was slightly dissapointed. I didn't think this was a bad book per se, but it was a little painful toward the end for me b/c it felt like the same thing over and over. I have been to a few of the countries they drove through, so it was nice to read about their adventures and feel a been there done that feeling. It is not as funny for me as it was for the others. I can't say this is one I would urge a friend to read."
4,"A pure, basic, solid and excellent sweet stout","Admittedly, we tasted the results two days before it was fully conditioned.The malty baked-grain flavor was superior. The beer was earthy, very flavorful, hearty -- everything I'd expect from a solid stout. The carbonation was very light, and there was almost NO hop character.In the many dozens of stouts I've had, from the macro Guinness to USA, European and African micro-brewers to home-brewers, this ranked a 7.5-out-of-ten -- and I am very picky!Definitely something I'll purchase again. (Probably repeatedly) Worth the time, worth the price, worth the taste."
4,Buy this and avoid the bars,"Costs about a $1/glass. In these recessionary times, one can save alot of $. In a bar, you pay $3-4/glass, $1 for some music, and have to tip the bartender???!!!"
1,Would give it a higher rating if I got what I ordered,Ordered the item as a present for someone. Got the October fest beer re-fill instead. Too late for a replacement. I hear great things about this product but just be aware when purchasing you might not get what you order. I did see another review that noted this. If you do stick with what you get make sure to look to make sure you didn't over pay for the item. Currently the October fest is priced $2 less the the St. Patrick's Stout.Mr. Beer Octoberfest's Vienna Lager Refill Brew Pack
3,Controller cover for Wii,"I rated this a 3star only because you get what you pay for and I paid very little for this product. To describe the product in one word, ""CHEAP"" with very little protection offered due to how thin the cover is. I would not buy this product again nor would I recommend it AT ALL. Go with something more like the original. You will not be happy with the quality of this product."
1,Didn't work on my system,"I have Homeworld I, and it rocks. I had hoped Homeworld II would have been cool. WRONG! It loaded onto my machine, and played the opening storyline just fine. After that, it locked up. No matter what I did, nothing. Maybe I had a bad copy, I don't know. If you get this, you better be sure."
1,Homeworld2 Demo does not live up to the past!,After playing the demo I notice that Homeworld2 Sucks in comparison to Cataclysm or the original Homeworld. They changed the controls for the worst. The AI sucks it seems they removed what made the original so unique in the fact that Tactics were very important. This game has become a C&C; Copy. To win all you do is build up a massive fleet and in one big group you crush the other player the question is who builds and collects money the fastest. So unless Relic fixes the AI issue I would wait on this title till you see some real reviews. I could not believe how much they ruined the game! I was just Amazed at the incompetents of Relic or who ever actually created the game.They should have done more testing with actual gamers!
1,BEWARE! High system requirements!,"I wanted to play and waited to play homeworld 2 for quite some time, only to find that my computer was not up to par, even though its less than a year old. I went and bought it anyway and it didn't work :( Be shure you meen ALL the system requirements so you don't end up like me:("
4,Great sequel,Excellent upgrade for the best graphic game ever created. Homeworld has outstanding game play and Homeworld 2 made that even better with the added scrolling camera views. Gives you the real feeling of the vastness of space and the effects of not being limited to the basic 2D battlefields. Hope the developers expand and make it a triology. Greatly written storyline to keep up with the homeworld tradition.
4,Changed my view of church,"I can't tell you how much this book helped me to see what the church is supposed to be about. I read this because Rick Warren mentions the author in Purpose Driven Church. It took awhile to find a copy but it is well worth the effort. This book will help Pastors and church leadership to focus on what Jesus has called us to do and strip away everything that He hasn't. This is primarily a ""why"" book. The explanation of ""how"" is a little unclear at times but if you are already a Kingdom citizen you will be able to sharpen the vision on your own. This can be applied to any church situation... traditional, contemporary, Pentecostal or denominational. Easy to read with lots of stories from Pastor Mim's personal experiences in the ministry."
3,A beautiful love story set in a troubled future,"It's 2021 and earth is in trouble, experiencing weather anomalies and a reduction in the force of gravity. People are literally dropping dead in the streets from a ""heart disease"" that is the result of loneliness or the absence of friends and loved ones. John (Joaquin Phoenix) is meeting with his estranged wife, Elena (a famous figure skater) to get their divorce papers signed. He soon realizes that something is wrong; his wife is in danger. Johns goes into protector mode and as the two of them elude those who would harm her, their love is beautifully rekindled.I loved this movie even though it made me sad. I don't think one viewing is enough since some of its subtleties escaped me. But I got the gist (it really is all about love) and will not minding watching it a few more times to figure it out. The performances of Claire and Joaquin make that worthwhile and rewarding."
1,Forget about Dogma 95,"I believe I understood everything about the plot...I just don't think it's any good. Drama and psychology is hardly existant, but this is not a realistic movie;you could call it a post-modern pseudo-sf fairy tale melodrama...But I say - it's simple nonsense. Starting from flying Sean Penn as the symbol of alienation (or whatever), with East European clones, decrepit hit-man (Mr. Morrison), global freezing, flying Ugandans, suspicious and sneaky character of the heroin's brother Michael...You name it. It's all there and it's all equally unconvincing and uninteresting...I'm not saying that the director had to stick to his ""Dogma 95"" roots, I'm just saying this is a bad film."
3,COOL FILM!!,"Not the best film ever made, but i reckon it deserves five stars for its originality. It's visually beautiful, suspenseful and touching, and I've certainly seen worse films by Phoenix and Danes but if your'e after your average run of the mill predictable hollywood popcorn movie, I wouldn't recommend this one. Also a word of advice to you other reviewers, don't pay too much attention to reviews, otherwise you'll be watching the same movies as everyone else! Think for yourselves...I'm glad I did."
2,Move Me To Sleep,"Sorry Christina, I love your books but this one just didn't hit the spot at all. I want to know who the 'ghost' is and does he ever walk again...but I'm afraid I can't suffer through the book to find out. Usually Dodd's book captivate me so that I don't want to put it down. This one, I wanted to get to the end of the chapter just so I could justify putting the bookmark in it. Maybe I'll resume it later...but for now, it's back on the shelf."
4,Star Wars Jedi Apprentice (The Threat Within),"Title/Author Star Wars Jedi Apprentice The Threat WithinCharacters: Obiwan Kenobi/a jedi apprentice searching for a decison to capture a criminal. But thinks his master is not trusting him. He makes a choice and succeeds.Plot: Obiwan is strugguling to capture an escaping prisoner. But his master isn't really on his side. His master and everyone else don't believe that the prisoner escaped. Obiwan is left with two choices. So Obiwan sneaks off and fights the criminal and apparently Obiwan made the right choice.Setting: The story took place in the future. It took place in many different galaxies.Theme: Sometimes making choices is the best thing to do.I liked the story because it was exciting and kept me reading. I like the futuristic technology and hope to create something, like the swords they used, someday."
4,Great sounds!,"Adagio is a must have for your music library....great to play whether you're napping, reading or making dinner for company!"
4,This author's innovation and humor make her a must-read,"What I loved about this book is the way the author used a ""self-help"" or ""how To"" format to tell stories about love and relationships. These stories are not comforting, nor do they ""help"" in the way conventional ""confessional"" stories are intended to do. What's great is the intelligence, the shock of recognition, and -- not the least of it -- the wise use of bad puns. In short, the kind of book you want to keep and read again"
3,Enjoyable Short Stories,"Although I did not enjoy it quite as much as Birds of America, Moore is a talented writer, with vivid portrayals of people slightly off of center. Like many people we know... Should be enjoyed by a wide audience."
2,Didn't work,They tasted good but the nausea didn't go away. Instead it was sweet and nauseous. I wish they would have worked because I like them but not as more than just candy.
2,"Taste fine, did not work for me.","There was nothing wrong with this product except that it did not help with my morning sickness. Unfortunately for me, nothing that anyone recommended seemed to help - not these, not B vitamins, not anything short of prescription medicine. Zofran is a miracle drug. I still threw up even with the Zofran occasionally but it really helped. Even at 6 months pregnant, I still occasionally throw up, so I'm probably not very normal. This might work for you, but it didn't for me."
1,pop drops,Didn't work for me. Intact they made me feel worse. I don't know if its just me or they are supposed to be a placebo help.
5,MUST HAVE,"I had morning sickness like crazy during my first trimester. These were the only thing that got me through that time period! I definitely recommend these to anyone experiencing ""all day sickness""!!!!"
1,not great,"These were not that sour, and didn't taste very good. Not a big help for the nausea. Buy your favorite hard candy instead. I think lemon heads worked well."
3,Taste good,"The preggie pops do taste delicious. They are sour flavored and come in orange, lemon, apple, and a red perhaps cherry. They do temporarily help my morning sickness/ nausea, however, I personally have felt that as soon as the candy dissolves, my nausea comes back worse. Addtionally, the candies are not smooth and did rough up my inner mouth a bit while sucking them. Also, because of the sour flavor it caused a citric acid type of reaction which also rubbed my inner mouth raw. So I only was able to have 3 yesterday. There are probably 2-3 handfuls of candies in the package. Although they taste good, I am going to try jolly rangers hoping for the same or better results at a much cheaper price."
3,Just Eh,"The relief these pops gave me was so subtle, it was barely noticeable. That being said, ANY relief is welcome. They also reminded me a lot of Jolly Ranchers and I'm curious whether there's something specifically in preggie pops that helps morning sickness, or if it's just the fact that they're something sour to suck on. If it's the latter, I'm betting there are some less expensive alternatives out there. I imagine lifesavers makes a sour collection or something. Of course, everyone is different and when you have MS don't rule anything out until you've tried it yourself."
2,Did not provide relief,I was disappointed in the Preggie drops as I was really hoping to finally find something that helped my all day nausea. They actually hurt my teeth because they were so sweet.
1,Not for me,"I bought these candies because a friend had suggested them. I have been very sick this whole pregnancy so far and these candies didnt help at all. The smell of them killed me, and the flavors wernt that good. I would not recommend this product to anyone. It didnt help me at all."
5,Excellent for Morning Sickness and Labor,"I'll start this review by saying that I never had severe morning sickness. I had nagging nausea that didn't result in vomiting. If you are really, really sick these may not help much, but if you have that queasy feeling in your stomach they are fantastic. Not only were they great for nausea, they were the perfect thing to have with me during labor. Most hospitals won't let you eat, so the small sugar boost these give you are great and help with dry mouth. Plus, there were times in labor where I felt the same first-trimester nausea and these helped me keep it together :)"
2,Wish they worked for me,"I've had terrible ""all day"" sickness with this pregnancy and was hoping that Preggie Pop Drops would do wonders like everyone says. I was so excited when I received them that I opened the pack right up and ate one. The flavors are absolutely delicious. Even the lemon (which I normally hate) because it tasted like lemon meringue pie to me. The only problem is, that they seemed to actually make me worse. It might just be because of the sweetness. That seems to be something that's setting me off, so although they may be helpful to others, they are horrible for me. I actually felt so sick after eating one on my way to go shopping that I thought that I was going to pass out in the store. I haven't had any since then, so I wasted my money."
3,Sleeves Too Long,"I'm 5'2 about 125lbs. Medium fits perfectly except the sleeves are way too long. If you are tall or have abnormally long arms, this jacket would be perfect for you."
1,Ouch! Too hard on eye sockets!,"I was hoping these would fix two issues I had with my current goggles - pinched nose bridge and hard cups too close/on the eyeballs. The bridge is fine on this product, but the cups are hard and dig into my eyes and hurt. I also bought Ilidz Tanning Goggles, and those were great!"
2,they do the trick,"these goggles are okay but i do wish they were more comfortable...&the pictures are much different from the actual product...i got a bright red pair &the little circle in the center, or ""lens"" if you will, is black so you pretty much look wicked scary when you're wearing them-then again...if you're in a tanning booth, no one should be able to see you anyway. i just wish i got the black pair...there should be an option to choose what color you'd like. that's all."
4,The second book I read of Vandermeer.,"This fit more with what I read fantasy for, with more of an action orientation. Still has some trouble with suspension of disbelief as some of the images evoked in this book are frankly beyond the realm of possible even in fantasy. The story of a city in the middle of a wasteland and the people who inhabit it, along with a nightmare underworld of genetic experimentation, the idea was unusual enough to garner a look, but it didn't seem to fit the mold of such stories. Still an engaging story and it was interesting enough to keep me reading till the end. Vandermeer isn't for everyone, and I'm still not sure if he is for me. Have to admit the guy is a good writer and knows how to turn a phrase and present a dark and quirky sense of humor."
2,Worst Book Ever.,"Meerkat Manor meets Saw.Seriously.Is this supposed to be a serious piece of horror? Because it made me laugh.But whatever.This is not New Weird, it's just bad."
4,great piece of music history,"this is one of those records that you just have to own for the simple fact that it is such an historic release of ""off the wall"" rock. the lyrics alone are worth the purchase. that being said, i don't necessarily think its a great rock record. there are a few awesome songs, but mostly they are pretty average. still, even though i only listen to two or three songs on a regular basis, its worth owning."
3,Mothers,Used to have this as a teenager. Saw it and wanted to get it again. Brings back good memories of H.S.
1,Poor Answering Machine Sound Quality,The phone works ok but the answering machine sound quality is very poor. I returned it. It is definately not worth the money.
3,"Fans will enjoy but this isn't his ""Greatest Hits""","Growing up in Montreal, I was a big fan of Kim Mitchell's group MAX WEBSTER. And, to me, Kim Mitchell's solo albums were even better.As a big fan of Kim Mitchell I've got most of his CDs, so what interested me most about this compilation were the previously unreleased ""No More Walking Away"" and the different versions of old songs (""Rockland Wonderland"", ""Expedition Sailor"", ""Lager and Ale"" and ""Patio Lanterns""). I think Kim Mitchell fans who already have his other CDs will enjoy this one for the new material.This compilation is a bit of a problem, however, for people who are looking for just one Kim Mitchell CD with his best. Because of the alternate versions, it isn't really his ""greatest hits."" Also, one of Kim Mitchell's best tunes was ""Feel It Burn"" from his AKIMBO ALOGO album. The absence of ""Feel It Burn"" from this compilation is a glaring omission."
5,THANK YOU AMAZON FOR OFFERING THIS FABULOUS BOOK!,"I received my copy of ""Sewing Luxurious Pillows (Creative Designs for Home Decor)"" today. I opened the package, and sat down in my new recliner (one of the reasons I purchased this book), and began looking through it. I had thumbed through the first few pages, and I knew I had picked a winner! I was, for lack of a better term, impressed, not only with the vast selection of pillows that I can create using this book, but also with the very detailed instructions for crafting the fantastic pillows featured. The directions (including the illustrations) are invaluable for any seamstress. If anyone is looking for a book of pillow designs, this is it! It has designs and ideas for any taste and decor, from simple to luxurious, from art deco to Victorian. I especially liked the ""how to's"" for creating tassels and trims. I can't wait to get started!"
1,Too salty and dry!,I ordered these chips and found them to be very salty and dry! There was a huge amount of spices in a ball in one of the bags I opened.
2,Not that great,"These protein chips definately weren't that great. I can't say they were awful but they have a really grainy dry kinda taste. I think they would be good with dips, but I have only eaten them plain. I ordered the 12 pack and still have 11 boxes left lol. I would recommend sampling them somehow, try 1 box if you can, instead of 12!"
5,at last healthy snacks kids LOVE,We love these and my kids takes them to school and the class fights over them. It is nice not to worry that they are eating too much junk food!
4,Good snack food,"THe chips taste great i love them, the only problem i have witht hem and this i why i gave 4 stars instead of 5 is the chips are kinda small and some times its like eating crumbs because they get smushed easily. OTherwise the chips are great. nice little healthy snack. also the packaging of the 5 oz bags arent very good either, but the product taste is great."
1,Protein chips = bleech,"The spicy flavoring on the chips is not bad and the chips are nice and crunchy. The chips themselves though, taste terrible. Somewhere between plain flour and dirt with a chemical tinge. No thanks."
4,Prtein Chips,"As endorsed by Dr. Oz, these chips do satisfy and are quite tasty. They do not leave an after-taste and despite their small size, are filling enough to complement a meal."
3,way too salty,"These were ok but far too salty. Also, although it looks like it would be an individual serving, there are one and a half servings per bag. Since it is difficult for many of us to leave a third of a bag, we end up eating too many calories!"
2,Used to love these things...then they changed the recipe apparently,"I started eating these about a year and a half ago and really liked the taste and texture. They were crunchy, much more 'chip like'...but about 10 months ago they batches I started to receive were significantly different. Much more of a soft, puffy consistency. I was hoping that I just got a few bad batches in a row but it is now clear that they must have changed their recipe. I still enjoy the taste...but am really disappointed in the texture now."
4,Former Dancer,"Very good video, but gets less challenging after about a week or so. Very good for starters though."
2,Horrible Sound Quality,The excercises really do work but the sound quality on my tape is so poor that it is difficult to hear even with the sound cranked up. I ordered this tape out of a magazine and had no idea when I paid $34.99 that the qaulity would be so bad.
2,Only for high stamina people - It's all abs...,"Hi...If you want a video that will help you get in shape, do not invest in this one. It is all abs-based and if you are out of training, it will not help you but discourage you. I personally don't like the way Kries explains the exercises. I understand that this system does work for some people, but only if you are one of those high-stamina-give me abs kind of person. IF you want REAL work out, less strenuos but way more profound, check CALLANETICS. AFter one class of that I felt muscles I had never felt before, plus, you don't STRAIN yourself like with this one (back, neck, etc) - Check Callanetics!"
5,good video,"I use the ten minute, Toning essentials once a week. I like it very much. Toning essentials is for beginners while the second half of the video is about thirty minutes and it is the same as Toning essential and more pilate movements."
5,"Easier with time, but definately fun trying.","I have done other Pilates workouts before, but I find this one more enjoyable becaue Jennifer doesn't push you. She wants you to do the work, but repeatedly assures you that you'll get better. People who do not exercise at all will definately find this workout challenging, but it gets easier as you keep doing it. I imagine it is probably most difficult for those who can not hold their ankles while sitting on the floor. I enjoy Pilates much more than running around and sweating to death, and I definately feel like I've worked out at the end of this video. I would recommend it to those who want to increase flexibility. Now I feel good about working out instead of dreading it."
4,"Good, but not a total body workout","This is a good tape, but there is virtually nothing for the upper body. Also, the exercises mix the demos with the workout, so you see this graceful sequence at the beginning, but stop and start during the actual workout.This is a lot cheaper than taking a class, however. I wish they would put out this same video with a few more upper body exercises and a straight through workout.You might want to borrow/rent Denise Austin's Mat Workout Based on J.H. Pilates--it mixes a bit of Yoga in, and she is not the best on technique, but gives you a more or less straight through workout--before you buy. She is not nearly as flexible as Kries, which for the vast majority of us is a plus, because you can get discouraged watching Kries."
3,An ok workout,"I kind of like this workout. It is somewhat challenging, although I get bored with it quickly. I'm not particularly fond of Jennifer Kries' teaching methods either. I don't doubt that she is skilled in what she does, she's just very bland, as is the workout and the appearance of the set. This was the first pilates video I bought. I did it a couple of times, and then didn't do pilates again for almost a year. I would suggest starting with Ana Caban's beginners video if you are new to pilates."
2,"Beyond Good & Evil is the Phoenix, this album was the ashes","I'm a Cult fanatic, but I pride myself on being able to separate my personal feelings toward a band and the way I would review an album. Admittedly the self titled 'Cult' was a dramatic creative departure for Ian Astbury and crew, however, the album is essentially ""Coming Down"" and a lot of mediocre filler that never really gets you going. Even ""Coming Down"" is aggravating at times as the intro is too long, and the time between verses needed to be shortened (thankfully, the single version is MUCH more listenable, you'll find it on ""High Octane"")in order for it to have been radio friendly.Credit them for trying something different at the time, but I think they needed to hit bottom before a wild comeback in Beyond Good and Evil..."
4,Eye Candy is Creepy,"Eye Candy, another great read by author R.L. Stine, is as scary as it is precisely because it's plausible. Lindy and her room mates decide that she should put an ad on an Internet dating site. Her friend titles it ""Eye Candy,"" and before she can think, guys start to respond to her. She gets a phone message telling her ""Don't say no, Lindy. Don't ever say no to me!"" And so the conflict: she must go out with all the guys, even the boring one, so that she doesn't accidentally disobey the caller's threat. Soon, things go from bad to worse. Which guy is threatening her? Who, if anyone, can she trust? These questions will all be answered in Eye Candy!"
3,nostalgic...kind of,"I have to say, after spending about 5 hrs reading this, it brought back memories. When I discovered Fear Street in middle school, it was the greatest thing ever. They took no time to read, and were interesting, and every once in a while I'd get a little creeped out. That being said, when I found his two books for adults(this one and the Sitter), I was happy. It was once again an easy read, a little disturbing reading some of the stuff he wrote, thinking""wow, my favorite children's author uses those kinds of words"", but after all, it's for grown ups. It reminded me of favorite books from the 7th grade. If you get this book, remember one thing, so you're not criticizing it-remember who wrote this. A man who writes wonderful books, aimed at 7-14 year olds, depending on the series. It'll take you back, to a simpler time. And for that, I think RL Stine did a great job. As for the plot, a little out there, but worth it, if you're a true Stine fan."
3,Disapointment,Music for the Masses is great. I orderd Loud because I thought it was going to be more alien sound effects mixed with high energy beats like Music for the Masses. Instead it is loaded with boring sometimes annoying vocal tracks.
4,BOY GEROGE & CULTURE CLUB,I got this on albums in the early 80's when it frist release in the U.S. I'm a BIG fan of Culture Club. To get were Boy Geroge got. You would have great albums and single releasees. If you like 80's music this should be a part of it.
2,Not the product I wanted,"This was not the original Corel Draw program - it was some ""OCB"" edition that does not do what the draw/photopaint program is supposed to do. Instead of being able to edit the photo, it only allows you to do ""OCB"" on it (whatever that is). Very disappointing."
4,JumpStart Spanish a winner,"My 5 year old loves her new JumpStart Spanish program. She has learned to count in spanish and her colors so far. Very fun games and rewards. She is really picking things up fast. We have not had any real computer problems, it has locked up once, but that has happened on other software as well. The sound works well. For the price I would recommend this as a beginning spanish program."
5,Who remembered?,"I looked at this album with the intention of downloading a track or two. When I started playing samples, suddenly most of the songs sounded familiar and great!You can't go wrong at this price."
1,Worthless,"More faceless, worthless arena rock from the late70's/early 80's. Along with Styx, and Journey, REO Speedwagon represens the worst of a painfully bad genre, with each being fronted with a really bad lead singer whose vocals are even less pleasant than nails being scraped across a blackboard."
3,"Good, but only for Nikonos?? not Sea and Sea or others cams?","Maybe for those people that buy Nikonos cameras this book is Ok, but what happenned with those who have Sea & Sea or others amphibians cameras?? This book only explain how to use Nikonos cameras and show tables with accessories of Nikonos, not others... In page 19: ""For 90% of amateur photographers, the Nikonos system is probably the best choice"" maybe this was true in past time, but I'm sure that now this words are wrong, because Sea and Sea or others good cameras are bests buys and testers choices...In generals contents of UW Photography this book explain very good from basics to professionals tips."
2,Packed Poorly and Broken,"Received Fiestaware, after an earlier backorder, just before Christmas. The shakers were wrapped together in single sheet bubble wrap, taped, and tossed in the box. There was no other packaging material. They arrived broken. Sadly, had to substitute another gift quickly. One star is for the poor packaging .. the additional star is for how quickly new ones arrived ... after Christmas."
5,"Great product, very durable and long lasting","Bought for my step daughter for Christmas. She loved it, uses it daily. Loved the big size and ease of handling. Great product, great value."
1,won't even fit my konica charger.,"this is certainly no replacement for np400.the picture is the actual item - not the title of the item.purchased this on the off chance is was as stated. but, it doesn't fit my maxxum 5d. had to return for refund."
5,Rowetta is a revelation!,"rowetta was one of the better acts on the uk show the x-factor.she quickly became my favourite performer..on some weeks when she sang, my goosebumps got goosebumps!!!yes ro' is that good and i'm a hard person to please..rowetta's album is the BEST album i have bought in yearsgo with flow go with ro'you will not be disappointed"
2,Very disappointing...,"Almost unbelievably, Mr. Freeberg doesn't seem to have a lot to say. I am the worlds biggest hockey fan, and even I don't care about two-thirds of the stories in the book. I don't care about the size of the goal judges box, I don't care about Wild Wing (the Ducks mascot) being stuck. I want to hear good juicy stories from an NHL insider....and there are precious few in this book. And Freebergs posture of cowering in the corner everytime his penalty box door opened got real old, real fast. I have yet to hear of an off ice official being assulted by an NHL'er, so the visual was just plain silly the first time...as well as the tenth. There is enough in this book for a good artical in the Hockey News, nothing more."
1,Frustrating,"It is frustrating making cards with this product. Among its deficiencies:-- Many cards have text on the front that cannot be edited. Apparently, the text is in graphic form. For example, you cannot change ""To a great girl..."" to ""To a great boy..."".-- The program puts your mouse in super slow speed, a behavior that persists when you attempt to use other programs on the desktop.-- When you select 'Hallmark Card Studio Online' the program hijacks an open Internet browser rather than starting a new browser session to display the online help."
4,Easier to use than Greetings 2000,"In response to Christine Iacomini, the one great thing that this version has over Greetings 2000 is exactly what she didn't like about it: it's very simple.We have the original version of Card Studio (version 1.0a, which we got almost 8 years ago) and the one thing my wife (not very computer saavy) loved about the program is that it was really easy to use. In fact, when she tried to use Greetings 2000, she insisted I install the older version (which is still installed and works great).Anyway, Card Studio 2004 does have enhancements over previous versions, but it also brings back a much simpler interface compared to 2000. This may irk some people that want a lot of fine-tuned control over their creations, but it makes it easier for those people that want a program that you don't need to hunt through the controls to use!"
2,Lots of Bugs in this Software,"Unfortunatly, I have been very dissapointed with the features of this software. The cards themselves are lovely but it's hard to change the print settings and use non-hallmark cardstock. When making calendars you are also unable to reprint individual months if they get messed up...like mine did when my printer ran out of ink. I am actaully considering returning this software via Sierra's 90 day warranty."
3,"work for vacation snorkeling, but would buy others next time","Bought these fins for myself and the kids for a trip and used them during about two weeks (light wear). They work rather fine but tend to get loose shape: the fins bends backwards quite easily after limited wear.Next time around, I'll look for fins that have stronger supporting ""ribs"" that restrain bending. Otherwise material quality and fit was good."
3,Not for heavy use,"I have had this bible for about two years now and make good use of it every week. I keep the bible in a carry case which it comes out of when I use it. Unfortunately the bible is showing signs of heavy wear. There are bits of the 'bonded leather' starting to crack and split. The pages and binding seem to be holding out just fine. Other than that I have found the NASB to be an excellent translation, and the wide margins very useful."
5,The Bible is in great shape,The Bible was everything I expected it to be. I couldn't tell it from a new one. Thanks for providing an alternate method to purchasing a new one and at considerable less cost.
5,Will be published approximately 3rd week in March by Moody,"Checked with Moody, they say this will be reprinted approximately the third week in March 2000, as well as the forest green red letter, indexed bonded leather version."
5,A Good Read!,"More great short stories from Robert Benchley! Not as good as Ten Years in a Quandary, but still a great read nonetheless. I'd recommend it!"
1,Very very bad recording,"The music is beautiful, the interpretation is certainly pleasant, but the CD is so badly recorded that it destroys the quality of the work. I'd love to find another one."
1,"8"" high on a stock 10/22","Stay away from this thing if you can. On a stock 10/22 rifle it shoots 8"" high at the lowest adjustment. Truglow needs to make the front sight post a lot higher. Definately do not recommend this unit."
4,An excellent academic translation,"For those familiar with other works by Tsongkapa, this books follows his usual outline style. At times it is obscure, but the author had done a yeoman's job in researching the Tibetan literature which is relevant and clarifies the points.This is a what to do and not do instruction book on how one worships a guru.Some appears a bit protocolish...Do you prostrate to a lay guru if you are a monk?Other parts are excellent advice...the exact qualities of a guru, what do do if you can only find a deficient guru.It is a worthwhile read for the serious Buddhist student. It is probably too much depth and erudition for the person who has casual involvement in Buddhism."
1,Does not work with Windows Vista,"I wish someone would have told me that it would not work with Vista. It sounds like a great product, but it needs an upgrade (see [...] before purchasing)."
5,Great book!,It has lots of old ideas I'd forgotten from my own childhood and it has lots of new ideas. The writer understands the needs of children. They can behave a lot better if they have interesting little things to do like the ideas that are in this book.
2,Not a good purchase in my opinon,"I purchased this because I have other Hallmark programs, which I like very much. I am highly disappointed with this one. Every time I tried to make a card, my computer hung up. I had to use Control-Alt-Delete to get out of it. I never could get one to print. Also I tried to make a card to email - it created a .exe attachment. A lot of ISP's and spam control programs filter out emails with .exe attachments due to potential for viruses and other harmful files.I ended up uninstalling the program. It also takes up a very large amount of hard drive space. I might try it again after increasing my RAM. I've never had the same problems with any other programs, though, as I did with this one, and I've used a lot of memory intensive programs."
1,This product wasn't worth the price even with a $10 rebate!,Very disappointed when I got this home and tried to use it. You are very limited in the personalization and you cannot resize the cards from half-fold to quarter fold.
3,disapointing,I am a hardcore Cure fan but i find this cd kind of disappointing a lot of the synths sound bad like they only used one patch for the whole concert so the tone is exactly the same throughout.The sound quality is otherwise decent for the time period this cd was released but there's not a lot of energy or any new revelations to be found to make it worth more than a curiosity like most live albums.Their best live album by far is definitely Paris.
2,Somewhat improbable,"As a fan of God's earlier work in Mesopotamia, I was really looking forward when I heard He was coming out with this latest work. Unfortunately, I'm sorry to report it doesn't quite measure up. I found this particular work to be highly dirivitive of God's previous writings. His use of deux ex machina really detracted from the drama. I mean, come on--Jesus feeding a thousand people from two fish?? I can think of a ton of other slightly more probable endings that would still retain the drama. I suggest in the future God maybe should study up on a good story structure book (Robert Mckee's book on story is quite excellent) for tips on more believable scenarios. All in all, not bad, but maybe next time confer with an editor for tighter composition. A little rambly."
3,Unsure of Worth,"I just installed Clean Sweep and don't fully know it's capabilities, so it's possible I'll change my rating. However, if you are used to clearing your internet cache and thought this would do it in one click instead of several, think again. It clears the temporary folder of most files, but is does NOT clear cookies. You still have to go back and do that yourself."
5,First Step Into A Larger World,"...this is the first time I have read something from the Jedi Apprentice series. I thought it was a great book!At no time was I lost. Jude Watson provided enough information so I wasn't perplexed by what was going on. This is a great jumping on point for people who are interested in checking out the series.I liked this book so much, I have started reading the series from Book 1!One warning, but I don't think it will be a major issue, DECEPTIONS does reveal a lot of what happens in the regular series. When I saw Bruck in the first book, I already knew his fate. But then so do we with Anakin.Highly reccomended."
3,Mulching Blade for Mower,It looks good but have to try and use with my rider mower and then I can provide proper review.
1,Died within the first month,The adapter died within the first month of usage. I have to bang it against the floor for 5 minutes before I can get it to work. It sometimes just dies even if I don't move it.
5,Everything went perfectly,This product was shipped fast and was exactly how described. Had no problems with shipper or product. been using it for a couple weeks now and no side effects!
1,Very poor-quality product!,"I've encountered exactly the same problem as others are describing here - the cable just beyond the grey plug that fits into the laptop is weak and it constantly cuts the power. Even worse, this has occurred after only 3 months of use as an actual ""lap-top"" laptop (which has clearly accelerated the damage). You think this part is expensive? I'm currently looking at $60+ for a replacement in the UK... (although my adapter is a US model)"
1,lasted two weeks.,Shoddy product. Bought it for my Lenovo T400...it lasted exactly 2 weeks before the wires at the barrel head broke...just like the original that came with the computer...except that the original lasted 4 years. Am ordering another mark...Anker? Hope it lasts better
4,Charger,"Pretty standard charger. It gets hot sometimes but it's not a big deal. It's good quality for the price, for sure."
3,noisy adaptor,"I purchased this product after the one that my laptop came with originally got broken - the wires close to where you plug it in to the computer broke.This is a problem that almost every lenovo owner experienced according to previous reviews.Surprisingly the original charger lasted approximately 4 years without taking any special precautions.However, the one that I recently bought through Amazon, although it was charging my laptop with no problems, it was making a high frequency noise, often annoying. So I returned it within a month of purchase. Amazon processed the return quite fast and gave me a refund. I plan to buy another from the Lenovo website and I hope it is better."
3,electrical tape,The Lenovo ThinkPad power adapter lasts about 2 years. (I live on my laptop) Twice I have had to replace them. This time we wraped the end that breaks with LOTS of electical tape so that it won't bend and eventually break the wires.
5,BFG GeForce 7800 GTX 512MB,"Full Throttle Graphics with 512MB of Pure Power! The GeForce 7800 GTX 512MB pushes the vertices per second past the billion mark, at an unprecedented 1.16 billion! The increase in memory and core clock speed gives this new card a boost in performance that separates it from the pack in benchmarks, and more importantly, real-world game play. The graphics processing unit (GPU) is overclocked an additional 30MHz on the core and 50MHz on the memory to hit a blazing 580MHz/ 1750MHz."
3,good but....,"I love O.Henry but this was not his best work.It was cool to read his last and first stories.I just don't get 1800s humor sometimes,"
1,"Too Short, Not worth the money","This outfit looks great but is designed for children smaller than 48"" tall. My daughter is 54"" tall and it looks like a tea-length belle on her. The fabric is all but see through and the layers are horribly wrinkled. I am returning it for something else.... Not what I ordered."
3,Hmmm....,"I'm think of getting this for Halloween to depict a certain character from a book. But, it's a bit too... frilly, if you know what I mean. And expensive, too. And if I want to get it before Halloween, I'll have to pay $11 more. Is it worth it? Really? Is it worth the time and money?"
3,Halloween Costume,This is a darling costume but the top ruffle is not quite long enough to overlay the bottom ruffle and the hat does not stay on. I had to sew a tie onto the hat to keep it on my daughter's head.
1,Not pleased at all,Out of the package it was so wrinkled. It looked a wadded up shopping sack. Then the dress tore 2 hours into the ight.
3,"Recomended for any die hard ""Betty & Barney Hill"" fan.","I am proud and honored to own an original copy of this hard cover book that was released or printed in 1966... the first official book about the infamous ""Betty & Barney Hill"" case! When reading it literally puts me into the time frame of life and wonder from back in the mid '60's and the feeling of what it was like for the public back then to hear about such a bizzare and unbelievable thing to happen to a common responsible American couple. I was a little dissappointed to find out that this book doesn't contain the complete transcript from the tapes of Barney Hill's version of the abduction... mainly because of the time frame and censorship of the graphic details of the truth from what happened to him that was reveiled in a later book. GREAT book to have in my collection with a set of B/W original pictures in the center of the book."
2,Jumpstart Typing - not described adequately,"This product was to be used on a MAC.We selected this version of Jumpstart typing because it could be used both on a MAC and PC. However, it only works on a very limited number of MAC versions. Rather than send it back and go through that hassle, we installed it on my PC and have my son come to my office and use it there.My advice (for what it is worth) is to warn people that this software will not work on many versions of MAC software.Wes Weisenberger"
4,Good,Helped my 10 year boy improve his typing. But he eventually lost interest in it. Buy the latest version.
3,Not Free SF Reader,"An artificial intelligence escapes its creators, and has its own plans for what it wants to do, and it seems it is happy to be violent to get them done.A group of alien races work together, including humans, but have different political factions, with different ideas on how to deal with this. They decide to put a cross-race team together to handle it, but political infighting continues while these teams train for their mission.One of the members of this team is a retarded young man who undergoes treatment to bring him to normal intelligence and usefulness."
4,Faithless?,"OK, there is some good stuff on this double-album, but more or less nothing from Faithless as I was waiting for. Strange...."
1,I hate the new Leverlock for these reasons too,"I'm a carpenter and used the old style leverlock since the mid 90s. When they changed to the inferior new version, I stocked up on a whole bunch of the old ones but I've broken them all now. The new version INFURIATES me, on a daily basis. I agree with all the other excoriating reviews, and will add new reasons to hate it: 1) I am absolutely dependent on after-market tape measure scratch pads - but they are ROUND, and the place to put it on the new LeverLock is oval. UGH 2)For inside corner measurements, I like to lay the tape and tape measure out and add 3"" (conveniently the width of the old LeverLock). But the new one is all rounded-like, and it isn't possible to do the add-3""-trick DAMMIT.It wasn't broke - Stanley oh Stanley why did you have to fix it???"
4,Simple and effective,"Great tape measure. I love that I can just pull it out and not worry about trying to push a lock down. The only problem that I have encountered it that where the tape retracts into the case there is a lot of friction. This is due to the lever design, the black lever pushes the tape into the case. This is what takes the place of the locking mechanism. Anyways, this friction has worn down the ticks on the first 3 feet of my tape. As a result I find it very difficult to get an accurate measurement in these first few feet. Other than that I am completely satisfied. Would never go back to a 'traditional' tape ever again."
1,They Should Have Left Well-Enough Alone!,"This tape probably works fine for the homeowner. However, I'm a professional carpenter and I use a tape measure daily. I loved the old style of this tape - I HATE this one! It's awkward and fits in a tool-belt tape holder like a round peg in a square hole. I wish the ""think tank"", that probably never cut a piece of wood in their collective lives mind you, that had the idea to change the design of this tape, would just change it back."
1,Don't buy it. Go back to the old version.,Stanley listen to me. Go back to your old tape. The lock is weak. The spring is weak. The button on the back works only sometimes. The outline is fatter. Please bring back the old neon ones. They were the best.
5,Exactly As Expected,"Rhetorical Grammar, by Martha Kolln, is an excellent choice for anyone wanting to improve their English grammar. Each chapter brings valuable information to the reader, with exercises placed throughout, and answers to the odd numbered questions in the back. This handbook is easy to understand and has ideas that are easy to grasp. I'd definitely recommend it for teachers and students alike!"
4,A Linguistic Study of the Gospel of Matthew,"Tresmontant contends that Matthew was written originally in Hebrew and later translated into Greek. In this book, Tresmontant translates Matthew from Greek to Hebrew to English. In retroverting from Greek into Hebrew, he adheres to the lexicon used in translating the Septuagint from Hebrew into Greek. Thorough notes are provided which support his theory of an original Hebrew manuscript. I do not recommend this book for a general study of Matthew -- it's scope is too narrow. However, it is an excellent supplement for an in-depth study."
5,lovely sound making!,It is very easy to make lovely sound from low to high pitches. I recommend it as a must-have-item for clarinet users.
5,"Change is a good thing, this CD is one of their best.","The Samples haven't lost a step. From the somewhat dark and gripping opening track ""Black & White"" on, this CD is awesome. For those who disagree, I find it hard to believe you have truly listened to them over the years. #1) If you are looking for ""catchy and danceable"" you obviously aren't a true Samples fan. #2) If you think Kelly is in it for the money, you aren't a fan as well. True fans will appreciate this album, enough said."
2,Garden Shears,"These Shears broke in two pieces after about 10 minutes of use. The blade only goes up apprx. 1/4 inchinto the plastic and unless you are using this for ""dead-heading"" small blossoms I would not recommend this.I am a great big fan of Fiskars and almost all my tools for gardening are theirs, but they blew it on this one.I have since ordered ""Bonsai Shears"" which are from Japan they last for years, never get dull and will cut withease almost everything up to 1/4"" and cost less than #9638 floral shears."
2,Boring Elevator Music - barely metal,"Maybe it was the fact that I listened to this album right after listening to The Agony Scene's ""The darkest red"" album. Anyway, I thought it was boring and had very little redeeming moments. I played it all the way through and don't even remember any of the songs. You know how you usually listen to something ant at least a couple songs will stand out? Well not for me. The singer is ok, at time, everything else is boring. I also think some of the songs sounded the same. I think you could randomly spin this album and not guess which song you are listening to. Anyway, sorry, not my cup of tea"
4,Fun Facts,"This is a great book for any kid that likes interesting facts. It really does cover a wide range of topics. As an adult working in a library, I found that I couldn't put it down. I had to go out and get my own copy, and copies for my nieces and nephews."
2,"Cute, Fell Apart Quickly","My hound dog loves to play with stuffed animals. I was hoping for this to be a little bit well made since it is intended for dogs, but he had torn apart the seems with his ginger chewing in a matter of minutes.VERY tiny."
2,Dont waste your Money,If your lookin for guitar tricks-don't waste your money get Pantera or Steve Morse.This alblum sounds like a movie soundtrack not a guitar shred alblum.It Sucks!! I bought surfin with the alien-I thought it was great then I blew 100 bucks of hard earned cash on his other stuff and its a total disapointment-OUCH !!! EXPENSIVE JUNK!!
4,Nothing Strang Here!,"Satriani has always been my favorite among all the solo guitarist i.e., Steve Vai, Steve Morse, Gary Hoey, etc., etc. There's always been a certain passion that Satriani plays with. While Strange Beautiful Music may not be his most shredding of releases it has within it a detail that was lacking on other cd's. The recording itself is absolutely fantastic too. Very spacious sounding and a little warmer than other releases. It's great to see an artist take time to expand their horizons and be a little bit adventurous. This is truly one of Satch's best efforts."
3,wasn't worth waiting,"A big dissapointment,I give it 3 stars just for the old times sake.This doesnt sound like Satch,its so empty,no fresh ideas,sometimes boring.I only give 5 stars to ""oriental melody"".First""Engines of creation"",than this,what is happening with the master?He's gotta fuel his engines of creation,this is not worth of his name."
5,THE BOOK for casual & beginning birdwatchers in Illinois,"This pocket size book has the simplest identification method I can imagine. The birds are grouped by color, so no other knowledge of bird identification is needed. If the bird is mostly yellow, browse the yellow section, identify the bird from a full page color photo, and learn about the bird's habits, food preferences, range and other interesting information included on the facing page. I am only a casual birdwatcher, curious about the birds I encounter in my backyard and in my local area. This book meets my needs better than the more scholarly volumes I have purchased in the past. Stan's Notes included for each bird description contain ""I didn't know that"" information to enhance identification process. I recommend this book."
3,Basic screwdriver set at an affordable price,"If you are looking to put together a very basic toolkit for around the apartment or dorm, this screwdriver set is an OK deal. They are not great screwdrivers, but they will get the job done at an inexpensive price.Honestly, if you can afford a little bit more I would recommend going with craftsman hand tools. They will last a lot longer and at least in the US, you can walk into any Sears store and get a damaged tool replaced for free. I have no idea what it takes to replace a damaged Stanley tool."
5,The Very Best of Frank Sinatra,"Read Daniel Berger's review below and the Editor's review for excellent details. You'll usually find me reviewing math and physics books, but Sinatra, Jolson, Nat King Cole, Rodgers and Hammerstein, George M. Cohan, Bing Crosby, and a few others have a special place in Heaven. Sinatra's humanitarian work on behalf of the Italian American community was an incomparable tribute to the people descended from Leonardo Da Vinci, Michelangelo, Verdi, Rossini, Vivaldi, and countless other greats. As for claims that he associated with the wrong people, there is no such thing as guilt by association, especially in a nation that has almost continually cut the budget of its own Veterans Administration and where top political leaders are frequently caught with their pants down and the IRS has already lost its pants. Music, like baseball, doesn't follow a political agenda, and neither did Frank."
4,Enjoyable CD,"This is a great CD set, especially if you are a Frank Sinatra fan and don't already own a lot of his stuff. I only have one complaint (which is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5). When I listened to these CDs on my stereo at home, the balance between Sinatra's voice and the band was fine. But when I listened to it with headphones on my commute (on an MP3 player), the band way overpowered Sinatra. But this flaw outweighs the overall quality and enjoyment of the CDs."
5,Very Good,Very good . Lp sent on time as required. Good description. of Lp . Cannot be bought in UK or anywhere other than usa
3,Care Bear Sing A Long,"The bear is cute. If your child likes Care Bears, they will love this one. However, the Sing A Long part did not seem to capture my daughter's attention for very long. Not as long as I thought it would. Once she had 'used' it all once, she was fairly well done with the sing a long portion. If I had it to do again, I think I'd just get a plush care bear and forget the 'fancy' part."
3,Kiton - Same as Davidoff Cool Water,"I wish someone would have typed this to save me some dollars. Kiton is the same or incredibly similar fragrance to Davidoff's Cool Water. Nice, but there are better."
1,Mini-Fridge earns low spot,NO adapter comes with unit. Motor is only good for 1300 hours. Do not buy this. I was foolish.
5,Funny stuff,"My husband and I have read these tandem readings to our class and every time we do, the kids are giggling at the silliness of the characters. It helps you to have just one more way to teach the stories of the Bible. I reccommend it to anyone that teaches kids even up to middle school age.(My teenage daughter thinks they're funny as well.)"
3,"designed for looks, not ease of use","I have no complaints about the ability to find and hold a station. You must look at the sleek buttons, however, to turn it on/off, change stations, or switch between AM/FM. They are all right next to each other and feel identical. Switching between presets only works in one direction, so if you pass your station you have to cycle through the entire list. Also, the display lights up every time you touch a button, which is good in the dark but quickly drains batteries. Included earphones are uncomfortable."
1,Dysfunction. Probably will give it away. Read on.,"Like seek feature and general styling. But it has two severe problems that make it unusable. Reception is poor. But, especially bad, the electronic ""stepped"" volume control has about 30 steps. In a quiet environment, the first volume step is low, the second step is loud, the third step is too loud. The listenable volume should be spread out throughout the 30 steps. Basically, I had two choices with the volume: too low or loud. I'm looking for someone to give it away to. Maybe I'll sell it on Ebay."
1,Ate Batteries,Great price. Great design. Went through batteries at the rate about a set every two weeks...and I only used it about 2 hours a week.
2,Disappointing,This product is disappointing. The ear piece already doesn't work. It's bigger then expected and the radio station reception is not great.
1,insufficient sensitivity,This receiver doesn't work in rural areas. It doesn't work as well as a cheap battery powered fm radio.
2,Useable but needs two major improvements,"This is an ok radio except for the following:1) AM reception needs improvement. Sometimes you must hold the radio in your hand and angle it one direction, and then another, to keep reception on a somewhat even keel.2) Volume control is digital, controlled by two buttons. There are not enough volume settings. When the batteries are strong and you are in the vicinity of traffic noise, one volume setting is two low and the next one up is too high."
4,Decentish,I got this radio as a gift. It works alright. It has a problem with the volume though. It goes from quiet to loud in one increment. The next increment after the loud one is the same. Reception is average. I have had it for a few years.
1,Don't buy this,"Came as pictured, nice packaging but once I opened it up it didn't work - tried everything it was just a P.O.S.Don't buy it period, its not worth sending back."
4,"not excellent, but ok","The digital functions are good, reception is fine. But it is much more bigger than I saw from the pictures and the level of the sound is too coarse: at level 2, no sound at all, at level 3, too loud for me. The maximum level is 16! it might be designed for people have hearing problem..."
1,Wish I could give it 0,"This chalk line can be summed up in one word: terrible. Like other reviewers, I have numerous other FatMax tools, and all work well. This line is extremely sticky, making it VERY slow and cumbersome to let out and reel in. Chalk goes everywhere, line sucks, basically as soon as I get to the hardware store to buy a new one, this is going in the trash. Gimmicks include some Sharpie and a viewing window to see how much chalk you have. Do not fall for it.A true waste of 8 dollars or whatever it is."
2,Why pay this much for this board?,This product is way too overly priced for me to even think about getting it.
3,Found by mistake!,"I found this book by accident when looking for a copy of ""Flight"" by Vanna Bonta to give as a gift. I shouldn't compare but Ginger Strand's ""flight"" is hobbled compared to the quantum fiction Flight I've known and come to love over a decade of child-rearing. By comparison, as far as titles go, Bonta's Flight merits the title. If not for the misleading title I give this one 3 stars for some afternoon reading to pass the time, this book is home spun comfort food like Walmart."
4,"Good, cheap, and reliable.","Good monitor to get if you are on a budget. I have been very happy with the resolution, and the picture quality since purchasing this.No complaints about anything with this monitor...at least yet.I would recommend this monitor as a good value."
4,Mambo of the Fiftys,Good songs. Cherry Pink and Apple Bloosom White and one of my all time favorites--Donde Estabas Tu-- among others.
1,simply einstein by Dr. Wolfson,"I read all the reviews.....bought the book......but on page 137 I finally threw the book down in disgust. It does not clarify relativity.It is totally confusing as to which frame of reference he's using.Its use of diagrams as examples for clarity is laughable and not helpful. I made it through medical school so I can't think that I'm unteachable. I have Dr. Wolfson's teaching company dvd's and like him. BUT.....this book is of no help. I am utterly at a loss , using what I learned from this book, to explain relativity to someone. I cannot recommend this book. Those that have read this book, I defy you to explain length contraction to me clearly.I'm sending it back for a refund."
5,Fantastic,What a wonderful way to learn how versatile these lovely ladies can be. Fantastically done in traditional Na Leo style. Bravo!
1,not a cooler,"I drove for an hour with the cooler plugged in, and it did not get any cooler inside. It might keep frozen things from fully thawing, but a regular plastic cooler would do it too. Not worth the money."
2,You only get some of the stuff shown on the picture,Received the cooler - it works fine.Couple things to watch out for - no manual in the box.That is odd - toothbrush comes with one..AC adapter - shown on the web site - not in the box.There is word 'optional' on the box near the picture.No phone number or any other indication on how to order it.Not the best shopping experience.
5,My favorite book!!,"The book was a great way for me to learn more about the Oregon Trail. I understood everything, and it had a great plot. It included scarey times, sad times,and just plain old happy times. I really recommend it."
4,Lots and lots of easy recipes,"What I want out of a recipe book is quick, easy, and most importantly, delicious chicken recipes. The Betty Crocker book doees just that. All of the recipes are for normal people with normal kitchens. There aren't any specialty foods or equipment that you will need to prepare and of the dishes. If you want a chicken recipe book that will keep you happy for a couple of years, this is the one."
5,A Must Have,"This book is very high quality, and is a must for any F1 fan. There are many pictures not available anywhere else, and all the pictures in the book are of a high standard, comparable to those found in an autocourse. The text is informative and gives a brief insight into the events of each season for the Mclaren team, although doesn't get too indepth for the casual observer. Well worth getting for anyone with an interest in motorsport."
4,Good for learning the songs,"I like this book for it's simple piano music. Great if you are learning to sing these songs... I also enjoyed the bios and history of the play. BUT, why doesn't this book contain ""War is a Science""?"
5,Excellent Trumpet,I read several of the other reviews and decided this would be a good trumpet for my grandson. We purchased it for Christmas and he really liked it. It was about 3 weeks into the new year and he was moved to first chair in the school band. I can only assume that the trumpet improved his playing by being a better quality instrument. I have since found that this is an intermediate trumpet and I am happy to say did not come at the 4 digit prices that you have to pay for the really good trumpets. I would say I am glad we got this trumpet for him and that now he has returned his rental one to the music store.
3,Beautiful but small,"I bought this case for my fz7 with no information about it.On the website of Panasonic they don't give you any info, only type and if has beltloop. I decided to take a chance.The case is small and very sturdy. The camera fits very well. Looks nice too. But there is no space for anything else. The camera, and that's it. The strap of the camera barely fits in it. If it had extra room for a battery would have been great. Guess I will buy the soft-case."
4,Practical and Full of Examples,"You're a busy pastor and you are trying to find preaching styles that connect with your congregation. But, you don't have a lot of time to read each of the latest books on preaching, nor all of the preaching journals, nor do you have the time or money to attend all of the top preaching conferences. Then buy this book and try some different strategies over the next several months. Frick gives an overview of several differnt approaches to preaching, and, best of all, gives good examples for each one of them. This is a straightforward and very practical book for the busy preacher."
1,Sutherland is not Lucia -- she is far too old in this version,"and too large (compared to Edgardo). Even musically (closing one's eyes), Devia is much better in my view."
4,Great Prima donna,"Joan Sutherland as Lucia. I guess the only reason I can't give it a five star is because I have tapes of Sutherland in the 1960-1970 that puts the voice in a totally different category. Yes, she was still great here, 1983. But her performances in the complete bell telephone hour is so superior to the one here that you would not recognize it. But as huge fans of the Dame, of course we have to have everything that she ever did. But for the new opera buff who wants to see why Sutherland is widely regarded as the greatest coloratura of all time, I suggest he look elsewhere, such as the bell telephone hour set, or the age of bel canto set."
3,Only Okay,"I have two pair. One pair cuts better than the other. I'm very hard on shears and expect alot. If I'm trying to cut through a thick hunk of grass sometimes I'm not able to make the cut. Only the blades are metal the rest is plasic.I have had the blades pop out of the socket the holds them to the handle. My palm sometimes get pinched between the lower and upper hadles when cutting. Because I try to cut thick wads of grass, the plasic handle bends a little causing me not to be able to get maximun force on the cut like I think I could with all metal shears."
1,These Are Junk,"I bought these last fall thinking they'd be great to trim the grass along the walk way. I don't remember using them at all last year; today I pulled them out of the storage space in the garage and discovered the blades refuse to close together. They stay open about an inch and a half! There is no way to adjust the closure space so I guess I just paid for a piece of junk. Too bad, the other Fiskar products we have are great. They missed to boat on this one and need to go back to the drawing board."
4,MY FIRST FAVORITE BAND,"This takes me back to when I was 10-11 years old. They had the first concert on MTV. They were my first favorite band. I watched MTV hours on end just to see REO on TV. This album has one of the best power ballads of all time in ""Keep On Loving You."" Gary Richrath's ""Take it on the Run,"" is one of the best songs about infidelity I have ever heard. ""Tough Guys"" featuring the Little Rascals (TV show) beginning is neat. ""Out of Season"" is one of REO's best rockers. This album even has a neat Bruce Hall song ""Someone Tonight."" It has it all. Of course, the hits ""Don't Let Him Go"" and ""In Your Letter"" are included and make this a great novelty record. I like to imitate K. Cronin by putting this album on the record player. There is nothing like vinyl."
3,Wow!,A pretty darn solid album. The band is working like a well-oiled machine on this one. Has a couple of slow moments but all of the songs are still good and more than a handful are terriffic! If you're an REO fan you have to have this one. If you just want to know what REO is all about this is the one to buy.
2,Good for the most basic changes only,"I studied this book thoroughly and then attempted to make a pair of plain pants that FIT. I've been sewing for 40 years. I did not get a pair to fit, and after 6 muslins, bought PANTS FOR EVERY BODY. The problem was, I have specific, difficult fitting issues - flat, low seat, small waist, big thighs - which this book does not cover. So, if all you need to do is add width or length, this book is probably ok. It sounded great in theory - slide, mark, trace - but in reality I could not even come close to a good fit in pants."
2,Has anyone got a safety pin I can borrow?,"Oh I seeee, its a SPOOF of a punk band.Sorry I only just got it."
4,Still the same,Not only is Seger a great writer but his music has a feel to it that few can touch. On this album he strikes a great balance between ballads and rockers. Again for my money only Bruce Springsteen can sing about American dreams lost and found like Seger can
1,worst company ever,"never got my order, no communication after first pile of excuses.totally incompetent, and still trying to get refund for order not delivered. no luck so far. all positive reviews must be written by them"
4,Crucial book for understanding Nietzsche,"Kaufmann is one of the greatest translators of Neitzsche. This book gives the reader extra insight with which to approach N's texts... very helpful, and very reliable."
2,Kaufmann's Nietzsche,"For a man who translated ten of Nietzsche's books, Walter Kaufmann exhibits a poor understanding of what the great philosopher said. He almost seems bent on turning Nietzsche into a Christian as well as an acolyte of Socrates's. It's best to stick to Nietzsche's own books!"
2,religious need,"Intelligent persons like Kauffman are close to accept Nietzsche'sbelieves, but the religious need, blind their minds."
5,The best of Duran Duran's albums!,"Everytime I listen to this album the music is still great, especially the songs that were never in the top ten charts, but are very good just the same [""Lonely in Your Nightmare"", ""Hold Back the Rain"", and ""Last Chance on the Stairway""].Everything on this album reflects the time period well--from the cover portrait to the music. A must for any Duran Duran fan or 80s music fan (or both)."
4,ACCESS 97,BOOK CONTAINS A LOT OF PICTURES WHICH MAKES IT VERY EASY FOR THE BEGINNING USER TO FOLLOW.
2,Just a collection of AP articles,"This is a collection of articles and photos from the press covering Tiger Woods during the 4 continous major wins in 2000-2001. Though worth a reading, would recommend only for Tiger fans."
3,Good as a reference book needs reformatting for kindle,"I purchased this after watching a few of Dr Mattu's lectures. The Ecg are very instructive for a practicing emergency physician. Kindle formatting is horrible, as the readings from the Ecg (answers) aren't as easily found as in a physical book. It takes a big effort to see if you're reading them correctly and therefore limits the ebook's usefulness. I'd definitely recommend the content though."
5,LRB - THEIR BEST OF THE SEVENTIES WITH MORE TO COME,"Greatest hits collections are an odd commodity, typically assembled as artists have amassed 6 or more hit singles. They are chronicles celebrating past achievements in hopes of promoting future collections.This LRB collection focuses on their 70s output and with two exceptions (THE OTHER GUY and DOWN ON THE BORDER) spotlights the Shorrock-Birtles-Goble era...and a fine era it was. My review is for the original 12-track edition.LRB, my favorite pop-rock band, is noted for their impeccable vocal harmonies and expert musicianship. Especially notable, too, is bassist/vocalist Wayne Nelson's consistent presence throughout their many transformations. And of course John Farnham who led the band into the 80s with a distinctive and excellent change.What can one say about these 12 tunes that are exemplary of LRB's incomparable sound. Just that each song is simply amazing. LRB is truly a name synonymous with the best in contemporary pop music."
3,What more do you want from a free book?,"Honestly, I can't much complain- this is a free edition of a classic text. There are some spelling and grammatical errors, but nothing too awful. Unlike some free kindle books, it is readable."
3,Surprised,"If you really like grassroots stuff this is great but it is not the Gratefully DEADicated, I didn't research and should have..."
2,Too Much Crude Language,"Max and Laurie Darling are delightful and Henny, Miss Dora, and Laurel are equally annoying and amusing. But, BE WARNED, if you do not like crude language, this book contains a lot of it. Numerous characters curse up a storm. If it weren't for that, I'd have given the book a much higher rating."
4,Thoughtful and engaging,"This book is an extrememly thoughtful commentary on the nature of reading and what it means to be a bibliophile, especially in today's age. It can come across as somewhat stuffy and self-important, but Robertson Davies' thoughts and opinions are varied and resonating enough to overcome that. He doesn't capitulate to the lowest common denominator, or present reading as a pursuit only worthwhile if one reads a predetermined list of ""great books"". his chapter on humour and comedic writing throughout the ages is priceless. It isn't a book for everyone, but it's a welcome relief from the endless parade of critics who typecast the typical reader as ""nobody' if they haven't read a set list of prerequisite books."
4,They will do,"Just received these and desided to put them through the test. I rated them four stars but not sure if they completely reach that. They are sharp but not nearly as sharp as one would think or others are overly generous. I will be putting them on the stone to get them to the point they should be. I am very happy to get non-seriated blades so that I can make sure they stay razor sharp. A tad more heft in the handle would also be nice. But as the title says, they will do. After all, I don't eat steak or foods that need a very sharp knife at every meal."
2,Not worth the price,"The CD is very nice and quite relaxing. However, the cost is outrageous compared to value of the CD. For the amount of money I expected much more from such a talented artist. If you are considering purchasing the CD do not pay more than $15.00 for new."
4,A Taste of Brown Sugar,"This CD would have rated five stars if it contained more songs. I've seen D'Angelo perform live three times, including one of his first few live performances. He's only gotten better with time. This CD is good but does not include some of the great songs that D'Angelo sings in concert. I had the opportunity to meet D'Angelo in Washington DC at his first concert there, and he is nice as he is talented. If you have not seen D'Angelo live, this is a taste of what you missed!"
3,Deceptive Representation,"It may be a best of Paul, Linda and Wings. But not of Wings. Some of this songs are from RAM, etc... I would have prefered a Wings greatest, not a mix mach. Anyway, that is why I am not buying it. Thanks. Later..."
4,wrong weight listed,"arrived within the week. perfectly fine saw but 11 ounces, not 3.2 as listed. returned it, was looking for something very light for backpacking."
2,Lifetime Warrantee... Not!,"Guess what -- I just dealt with Fiskars for their folding saw. Turns out that lifetime does not mean lifetime on everything. What's the most important part of a folding saw -- the ability to actually cut. Well, you see, Fiskars does not feel that their cutting edge should be covered by a lifetime warrantee. When you hear such things, you suddenly take note of lots of other competitive alternatives."
1,Only kills bugs for the first 20 minutes,"We bought this and used it at the family reunion. It only killed the bugs for the first 20 minutes. After that, it just glows blue and attracts the bugs, but doesn't kill them. We though maybe it wasn't fully charged. After charging it all night and all day, when we took it out that evening and it still only zapped the first 20 minutes. What a waste!!! We tried this 5 nights in a row and finally put it in the dumpster. Good riddance. T"
2,No answers,I bought this study guide to help my child in high school with his/her physics class. The best way I learned physics was to see how problems were solved and then apply them to those that were assigned to me. This study guide is more of a reading guide. It is full of fill-in-the-blank type questions. It has no solved problems. I was very disappointed.
2,The Mis-Step,"AFter two very good albums, I feel this one just doesn't hold up. The lyrics seem forced, and the music simply doesn't do a good job of hiding this fact. There are a good songs here - ""New Moon on Monday"" and ""Tiger Tiger"" stand out, but other songs border on cringe-worthy (""Shadows on Your Side"")."
2,Presumptuous to the last.,"Ugh. Beyond ""The Reflex"" (whose remix for video and single release were *much* more listenable) and the moderately enjoyable ""Union of the Snake,"" unless you're a hardcore Duranie you should skip this album. It seems that by the time of this album's release, DD figured they could do no wrong. Oops. The songs seem hastily written and forced, and Nick Rhodes' synths dominate too often whereas in the past they mostly accented Andy and John Taylor's guitar and bass."
3,It's Hard to Follow 'RIO',"This is an album of mixed pleasures. Some great pop songs intersperced with some tracks that are at best B-Sides. Stand out tracks are New Moon on Monday, Union of the Snake, The Reflex (although this was remixed later as the band were unsure of this mix) and Seventh Stranger....The rest are forgettable and I am sure that the boys would agree, not anywhere near their best. It is always difficult to follow a classic album like RIO, and this does not compare. If you are an avid Duranie, you'll love it, otherwise not recommended."
2,rubber cracked on all three pairs I've had,"I've given up on Columbia's boots... I've had 3 pairs over the past few years and the rubber part over top of the foot has cracked open on all 3 letting snow/water in. It's too bad really because otherwise I liked them... they were warm and comfortable for long winter walks and snowshoeing. Anyway, they get a 2-star rating from me."
5,Truly a great soundtrack...,"When I first saw this movie, I loved it from the very beginning, it practically personifies the american dream... One of the most inspirational films in history.I remember running out and buying the soundtrack when it was first released, over the years it's become old and obsolete. So I decided to buy it on CD and the minute I played the first track, I felt the same way I did more than 20 years ago, If you've loved the film, I gurantee you'll love the soundtrack. Believe me, you won't be dissapointed..."
4,You Must Read This if you are a Fan,"There is a missing song from the movie that everyone didnt catch. Everyone confuses 'Reflections' as the song that is playing when Rocky comes home after the first fight and pops on a record then goes to the mirror. This is not true.The song that is playing and is absent from the Soundtrack is 'Summer Madness' by Kool & the Gang'-1974. It took me a long time to track down this song because I knew all these years that was not Reflections playing in that part.I gave this record a 4 star, but should've gave it a three after figuring out that Bill Conti may have wrote 'Reflections' to sound similar to 'Summer Madness' to maybe avoid putting someone else's song on his complete album. You can make up your own mind on that, but the album is not complete as Kool & the Gang was left off the album. Sorry to disappoint. Now go get that song and complete it yourself as i did."
3,A different but mediocre video.,"This is a good video if you'd like to try kickboxing. Kickboxing is fun and energizing and the steps in this video are easy to learn. However, Stephanie Steele does not have much of an ""on screen presence"" and her music leaves a lot to be desired. I like to exercise for at least 45 minutes and this one falls a bit short of that once you fast forward through the goofy introduction. Overall, not a bad workout."
2,Not exactly a knockout,"Stephanie Steele's instruction is less-than-inspiring. In a word, I'd call it 'boring.' Having previous experience with kickboxing, I was looking for a good supplement to my regular training -- something I could pop in my VCR at home if I couldn't get to the gym. This is definitely not what I was seeking. Steele doesn't do a good job of explaining or demonstrating proper technique, nor do you actually get a decent workout. It is fine for those who are curious about the basic kickboxing punches and kicks, but anyone who has actually had any kickboxing training will be greatly underwhelmed. A better choice for the kickboxing novice would be Kick Butt, a video with a European kickboxing champ, a soap opera actor and a woman who doesn't say much but at least smiles (something Steele never once does). At least their instruction is more engaging and energetic."
4,"Great Workout, but not really for beginners.","I have been using this tape for almost a year now and I love it. However, it does have a few problems. Ms. Steele does not adequately explain the correct stances you are supposed to use. If I had not already taken tae-kwon-do and known the basic moves, I think I would have had great difficulty figuring out the correct moves. Also, she continually instructs you to fully extend your arms and legs and to lock your legs when you are doing the various kickboxing moves. I have always been taught that locking your legs and arms when exercising will lead to injury. Since I already know how to exercise correctly, I know when to ignore such questionable advice when doing the tape. But someone who is not familiar with exercising and how to avoid injury might have a problem with this tape. If you already know kickboxing and how to exercise without injuring yourself, this is a good workout."
2,Not for the Uncoordinated,"This may be a good video for those who enjoy kickboxing, but for the beginner I found it difficult if not impossible to do. This may not be the video's fault; I'm the most uncoordinated person I know, but I definitely prefer ""Buns of Steel"" to kickboxing."
5,The story of a family.,"I truly enjoyed this book.Patrick Ryan uses a family as his cast, which allows him to focus on specific characters for different sections of the work. The result resembles a collection of short stories that often seem unrelated-- though they share common characters. Each chapter chooses different people to focus on, and jumps forward and back in time. In the end, the varying stories all help to illuminate the history of a remarkable family.In particular, I felt that the chapter entitled ""That Daring Young Man,"" was quite masterful. Not only does Ryan address the complex relationship between two brothers (one who is gay, the other also gay but closeted), but really gets at the desperation and frustration of discovering one's own sexuality. It was unlike any gay ""coming-of-age"" story I'd ever read-- truly unique.A unique and thoughtful read. Highly recommended."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS MOVIE,"I bought this film thinking it would be good due to the fact that it was based on one of the greatest books of all time, boy was I wrong. Before anyone buys this film they should know that many of the charectors are not animated and are cheapily produced versions of real people edited into the film. When they get to Bree all charectors asides from the main ones are real people edited in with the hobbits and dwarves there played by what appear to be midgets. Asides from outdated and flawed animation forms many important story elements are left out and the film itself is incomplete. This film at best would be entertaining to small children."
5,excellent,"If you like the Lord of the Rings, then I don't understand how you can't like this movie. It is one of the finest animated movies ever made, period. Yes, they cram two books into one two hour movie, who cares?? It is still the Lord of the Rings man! Also, we all have a picture in our minds of what things looked and sounded like from these incredible books, (as it should be) but are the drawings that far off?? Of course not, every single drawing I've ever seen from these books (about six artists worth) are all similar, and if you disagree, then you need to have your vision checked. To conclude: If you love Lord of the Rings, then you WILL enjoy this!!"
2,Please Note: THIS IS NOT THE SAME AS THE ANIMATED HOBBIT!!,"I purchased this DVD with the thought that it fit with the animated Hobbit and Return of the King, and I was rudely shocked. This was done by a different director, and is nothing like the other two. There are no clever songs. The animation is much poorer, incorporating some live action. This is not a quality film by any means, however, it is kind of amusing from a bad movie standpoint. Be forwarned before you buy."
1,Poor,"Maybe if you saw this when it was new, it was impressive or entertaining. Today, the animation is jittery and the rotoscoping is jarring, distracting and doesn't mesh with the rest of the animation. The storyline doesn't flow well, but jumps in fits and starts. And the character design is utterly atrocious and at in many cases is blatently at odds with the depictions in the books."
4,I remember liking this movie...,"I also enjoyed another Bakshi movie called ""Wizards"". I justwanted to relay what I heard years ago: the profits from Bakshi's first movie,which covers half of the Lord of the Rings, was supposed to finance the second half,but the first movie either lost money, or did not make enough to finance the second,and so the second was never made."
1,avoid,"Yes, I saw this as a kid. It [was bad] then, and it still [is]. The animation is horrible, the voice acting lousy, and the story disjointed and cut up poorly. It is a shame really as the books are one of the greatest examples of English prose. They should have had a much better treatment."
1,Strange graphics and even stranger hair,"Okay, first of all, these people have huge hair. Every last one of them. Don't even talk to me about Saruman (or Aruman, as Bakshi the Banshee half-puts it). I understand why he's leaning over like he is in the cartoon. Plus, that new animation they were trying. I can see why it never took flight. It really stinks. The Return of the King had better be much better."
2,Did we all see the same movie?,"I am no 'die-hard lotr fan', but I know a rotten movie when I see one. The quality came nowhere near 'THE HOBBIT' or even 'THE RETURN OF THE KING'. Gandalf and Saruman were horrable, and those orcs---. This is the kind of film that gives LOTR a bad name. On the good side...Gollum was as interesting as in the books, and (better still) therer was no sequal! This film is o.k. if you absolutely MUST watch all Tolkien-related stuff, but don't show it to the uninitiated. It will ruin any chance for you to get them to read the book!"
1,Horrible. Simply awful.,"Ralph Bakshi's version of TLoTR is a disgrace to mankind. Although I am a fan of Bakshi's work {especially ""wizards""}, I am left wondering what he was thinking when he released this garbage. Don't watch unless you are a huge Tolkien fan {like me}."
3,"Movie is OK, but BEWARE the Digital Copy","I loved this movie as a kid. I know it has its problems-the rotoscoping, the continuity in the animation, even the fact that Bashiki ran out of money and didn't finish the set so the movie stops short. I know the MOVIE. What I didn't like about this was that I mainly bought it for the digital Copy. It was something safe for the kids to watch on the road. Only to get home and find out the the digital copy is drm'd Windows Media Player only! And the WB digital download manager that you have to install to even get the download hit my virus checker with 2 different Trojan Horses! Needless to say, it doesn't say this on the packaging and I am disappointed.WB is going way down on my list due to DRM issues!"
1,Loyal adaptation doesn't mix with confusing execution...,"Ralph Bakshi's 70s film based on the first and some of the second books in the Lord of the Rings trilogy. While the adaptation is very loyal, the animation, particularly the retroscoping, lacks feeling or scope. Some of the scenes seem very hastily put together and many sequences are incredibly confusing, making this film hard to watch. The runtime, a lengthy two hours, stretches this movie out and soon the story drags on and gets very boring. Watching the film, one wishes Bakshi would have been given more money so that a better and possibly brighter look could have been presented. Instead, we get a long-winded and confusing couple of hours with animation that is very subpar."
5,Lord of the Rings,"A true classic. This animated video broke more ground than Disney had at the time. Some of the sequences trick you into thinking real actors were being filmed instead of just moving pictures. I recomend this film to everyone, except maybe small children because it may scare them in some places. I hope Hollywood does as good a job with the live action version!"
1,Lame,"It's not worth it. I didn't even buy it. My roommate did. I can't even sit through the entire thing. If you're a fan of The Lord of the Rings then put this back onto the shelf, or delete it from your shopping cart. Save yourself sanity and money."
3,Uhh......,"I bought this movie from wal-mart, because i liked lord of the rings a lot and had watched the movie. I thought it would be good. I was wrong. The cartoon was close to the newest movie's storyline, but the cartoon just looked plain weird. I was also disapointed when i saw Strider. He reminded me of an indian."
2,THE FUNNIEST $%@# THING I HAVE EVER SEEN!!!!!!!!!!!,"This movie had to be the cheapest, most horribly made LOTR translation ever made---this is what makes it so funny!! However, this does not mean I approve of it. Here's my list:1) WHAT THE HELL DID THEY DO TO SAM?!?! As stated by many, he is supposed to be a sturdy, loyal hobbit, not some weird, buck-toothed, babbling moron that is apparently gay!! He is my favorite character, and Bakshi does not do him justice by any means (for the best Sam, in my opinion, see PJ's film).2) Why was Boromir a Viking?? I don't ever recall reading about Vikings in Middle Earth...3) Gollum--enough said (again, see PJ's film for the best interperetation).4) Why was the Balrog a 8 foot tall man in bell-bottoms and a lion head? Again, does not do it justice.I know I am repeating many other reviews, but I wanted to stress this fact: don't buy/rent this movie unless you are in the mood for a laugh and have over 2 hours to spare."
4,Wish I've gone to Tomoe,"Totto-chan started going to Tomoe by accident, or to be exact, after being expelled by other ordinary schools. Tomoe was an elementary school started by headmaster Kobayashi before the war (in Japan) broke out. He loves children and uses all of his energy (he spent 2 years in Europe to study different methods of teaching) to make learning a wonderful experience to all his students. Her years at Tomoe deeply impacted Tetsuko Kuroyanagi (Totto-chan)that she wrote this wonderful endearing book that vividly follows her life and times there. This wonderful memoir can be a very nice addition to any library, especially to anyone who loves teaching little kids (6-12). The book is actually a compilation of short essays, so it's easy to follow Totto-chan from the day she entered Tomoe. I could only wish I had gone to this kind of school when I was her age!"
5,Great Watch,My husband couldn't be happier with his Seikoflex Watch. Easy reading and the flex band is great. The band on the old one (at least ten years old) was starting to wear. Thank you
4,ha ha! !,This book is a great joke. The first joke is the concept: that there are any women out there who want to 'stay single'. Hee hee hee!
2,The Children's Big Picture Book of Triathlon,This is too basic to be helpful. The author admits taking most of the training plans published from popular web sites where they are published. It spends sentences describing what other books spend chapters on. I recommend Triathlon 101 for beginners/intermediates and The Triathlete's Training Bible for experts/intermediates. Great pictures though (reason I gave it two stars instead of only one)?!?
4,My first Triathlon,"I have started to run half marathons and now would like to start on triathlon, as there were many questions I choose for this book, it is really ilustrative the way of training and the way of getting in shape injury free. This book is recommended for beginers and the ones that are coming back to this tri-sport. I'm giving it a 4 stars just because I'm strugling on how to combine the weight lifting weeks with the swiming, running and bike training sessions. Once I complete my first tri I'll be very happy with this book."
1,Completely unusable,The touch pad control for the Zen Micro is completely unusable. I tried the various sensitivity settings and it didn't make any difference. Creative's support line people suggested firmware upgrades but that didn't make any difference. I'm sending it back! I've used touch pads before on laptop computers without any problem.
2,Great when it functions,"I bought it from Amazon in February and the earphone jack failed in three months. Check Creative's forum to see how common this problem is.It was still under warranty and I sent it back for repair. They sent me another one with the disclaimer that this may be a refurbished unit. This one lasted about a month before the hard drive completely crashed. Again, check Creative's forums to see how common this problem is.The warranty is almost done on this product, so I'm looking at IPods now.When it actually works, it sounds great."
1,Does not use wma files,"The micro is my first mp3 player, but I have been putting all of my CDs on Windows Media Player for a long time. I cannot get my wma files (pretty much all of the CDs I copied to my computer) onto the creative software! It is not like I want to sit around and rip all of my CDs over again (some are so scratched I can't do that anyway). Otherwise this is a good product, but still this is a huge deal. Creative states that thier software can recognize wma and mp3 files. Liars!"
4,Good player with small issues,"Well..I received my player about 14 days ago and love it, except for one thing- The headphone jack is malfunctioning, it was shorting out. At first I thought it was my headphones, but after trying several pairs, the problem persisted. When researching this issue, it turns out that most of Creative's mp3 players have this same problem, and the only way to fix it is to return it for repair or exchange. That sucks. Also, the touch pad is really sensitive at times and at others, it won't respond at all. Other than that, it is a great little player, very easy to use."
4,"it was nice, and then it wasn't","after about a month it started freezing regularly when I tried to turn it off. The only way to unfreeze the thing was to take the battery out.Then, about a week later, it just completely froze, and the screen showed a picture of an unhappy zen micro...Well, obviously this wasn't normal, so I called Creative and they said normally they would replace it, but they discontinued the product. Oh well, I did get my money back, and the customer service was good, so 4 stars.I really liked it, and I would recommend it, I just hope it doesn't break."
5,Great!,"I did not order mine, so I do not know about the customer support, but it has worked exceptionally over the 2 months I've had it: high quality sound; easy-to-use and very responsive touchpad; hold very many tracks, and does much more than I had expected upon buying it.I hear a lot of talk about it freezing up, if it's just the touchpad freezing, then the knob at the top is pushed into the ""lock"" position.This is a great product!"
5,Waaaay Better Than an iPod...Yet Another Reason George Bush is an Idiot,"I got my Creative a few months ago, and I love it. It's really small, and easy to use. I don't really like the software that comes with the Creative, however. I would really reccomend using Windows Media Player instead of their own product. I also really appreciate the radio, the calendar, the clip, and the voice recorder that comes with it. The Creative wins over all MP3 players, hands down."
3,"Great player, poor software","I echo the sentiments of a previous June 2005 reviewer who had nothing but complaints about installing the software and getting the PC to recognize the ZEN Micro. I finally got all but the Explorer utility to work, but only after trying 2 different PC's and many hours of installing/uninstalling/rebooting/etc and time on the phone with Creative ""Help"" staff. This is ashame, because its got a lot going for it. Mine is going back to Amazon and I will wait for the 2nd generation to come out. I felt like a beta tester for ZEN!"
1,UGH,"I was so hopeful when I ordered my ZEN MICRO. It had issues right off the bat, with freezing up, staying in 'SHUTTING DOWN' mode, and just not functioning very well in general. The touch-pad would be a great thing if it worked well, and as I never had issues getting songs transferred to the player, I did have problems accessing them from the player.Many other reviewers are mentioning that they have had no problems at all> I would say that the main problem is that this player is just not made very well. It is the 'first generation' of the player, and while I still agree that it is a great alternative to the iPod, I think there are many others that would be a much better value for your buck.If someone asked me flat out, i'd say to go woth something else."
1,Thought I'd ignore advice,"I read all about the headphone plug in problem, but didn't know it was that bad. Horrible sounds quality unless you jiggle the plug only to get it working for 3 seconds. Trading in for ipod...you get what you pay for. Don't go cheap."
2,Seriously in need of help!!,"I really loved this mp3 player, it had great sound, useful features, and it held all the songs I wanted, but then, it started screwing up. I was listening to it and it just froze. It wouldn't turn off or respond to anything, so I took the battery out and put it back in. When it turned on, it was on recovery mode, and I don't know how to get out of it! I've tried letting the battery die and recharging it, rebooting, cleaning up, attaching it to the computer, reloading firmware, and pushing just about every button on there, but it still won't go away! I can't listen to anything until I can find a way out of the recovery screen. The exact same thing happened to my sister at about the same time. If you know how to fix this, send me an email at qwerpi@kiwibox.com. For anyone thinking of getting a zen micro,just pay for the ipod, it's worth it."
3,"Great Idea, Not sure about quality","It's hard for me to give much of review. I recieved my Zen one day, and the hard drive was shot the next. It just up and froze. I tried taking out the battery to reset it, but that did not work. I then waited for the battery to run out completely and then tried again. But no luck. So, sadly I just shipped it back to Amazon today. I was really excited about the fm recorder and the small design."
1,Faulty Headphone Jack -- once again,"Bought the Micro in Dec. 2004. Headphone jack conked out after 4 months. It took Creative 6 weeks to send me a new one. Now, 7 months later, headphone jack conked out again. I don't even use the thing a lot -- maybe a few hours a week. BUYER BEWARE."
4,If only...,"This MP3 player is definately an iPod mini killer. 25% more storage, FM tuner, microphone, radio recording, and personally i like the look of the zen better. I would give it a five but there is one MAJOR flaw. The program bundled with the zen is very, VERY hard to use. I do not understand half of the functions in the program. Ripping cds into the player is a big pain in the but because half of the cds i have (i own aout 92 cds) wont even rip all the way, the program rips all of them fine except the last song (i.e. Hoobastank The Reason, Korn Untouchables, Blink-182 Enemia of the State, amongst many other cds). This is very vey annoying. If anyone knows of another program that can put music on the zen micro, a referal would be nice. Also, I've tried putting music that i've ripped with iTunes onto it but the artist and album names are reversed. Except for the program i would give the Zen Micro a 5."
1,DO NOT BUY ZEN MICRO,"DO NOT BUY THIS MP3 PLAYER. Battery life is horrible and tech support was even worst when I called about the battery life. Creative claims that they have resolved the battery problem by introducing new firm ware. I downloaded it and the same problem. Many people have had trouble with this product, buy something else."
1,Disappointing,"It was easy to load songs onto this player. However, I had to return for refund within two weeks because the inner display screen cracked, making it impossible to see what was playing. Amazon replaced it, and two weeks later, I had a new problem--the headphone jack stopped working. This is not a well made item and I would recommend ipod or another player which has a better quality. The only good thing to come out of this was that Amazon proved to provide excellent customer service."
1,Not happy,"Hard to figure out and organize music... battery life not what is promised and needs to be changed often... don't recommend it. Very ""Not happy"""
1,WAY OVERPRICED,"You get 5GB(holds 1250-2500 songs) for $250 when you could have the Sony Digital Walkman 20GB(holds 13,000)for $350. About 10 times the # of songs for only $100 more. You can't play movies on it like you can with the 20GB RCA jukebox/media player,has a 3.5 inch flatscreen and can hold 80 hours of movies(about 11 3.5hr movies,40 2 hour movies)The Accessories not includedCase-$15-$45(included with Sony's and RCA's)USB cable-$30(included with Sony's and RCA's)No free songs(30 free with Sony's Walkman digital music player)Dock $40(included with Sony's and RCA's)"
1,Zen micro - poorly designed,"This player has a decent audio quality, but it has a lot of fatal flaws:1) Its headset socket is extremely poorly designed. It does not go through the PCB, so the factory soldering cannot keep it in place. I have re-soldered it once already and within 2-3 months it is back to the same problem.2) The radio is useless. I live in the Chicago metropolitan area and I cannot get any of the radio stations I normally listen to. Even in the gym where their transmitters are close enough I the FM tuner does not pick up the signal.3) It is extremely slow when booting up and navigating is slow.4) The keypad is a pain too, even though the sensitivity could be adjusted.I would not recommend this player to anyone."
1,Repeat after me...,"1) Poor construction: loose headphone jack due to poor soldering, resulting in warbly sound2) #1 is/was a widespread problem3) Poor customer service and proven poor track record in being accountable for fixing issues4) Microsoft ""Plays For Sure"" technology: Kludgy--doesn't work wellI did everything I could to not have to buy an iPod. But after a year-plus of frustration, I'm buying an iPod."
1,Disappointed,"This is the first MP3 player I have owned and I didn't want to be like everyone else and buy an iPod... but now I feel stupid. My Zen locks up all the time and I have to stop what I am doing, take it out of its case, remove the battery and pop it back in before it will work again. Also, the battery doesn't stay charged for more than a few days of non-use and it seems every time I really want to listen to music it's not charged. You only get phone support for 60 days so when it stops working completely after 60 days (like mine has) you have to use email support. I am very disappointed in this product."
2,Dead,"I killed these gloves in little under a month. To be fair I wore them a lot and was doing lots of brushing with them. They may be ok for construction, but I wouldn't buy them again."
1,Never downloaded,I am very frustrated with the downloads of tv shows. This one did not download at all. How can you remedy this situation and make it right?
4,Le Bar Soundtrack,"Decent tunes, good mix for a cocktail party. Embodies the vibe of Le Bar quite well."
5,Hug this book!,"I LOVED this board book, the first children's book I have ever read by Max Lucado. Immediately, I made a list of about 10 kids I wanted to send one to. Lucado, in his simple and warm style, explains what makes each of us special and unique, and links it with the concept of God and heaven. FOr those of you who struggle with how to introduce the concept of God to your young ones, this is the book for you!"
4,Dependable,"I have had this unit for over three years and it has never let me down. It held up against backpacking multiple days in freezing snow storms, albeit I was using lithium batteries in it at the time. I would buy again."
3,overpriced,"If I was to purchase a headlamp again, I'd just go to Walmart and get their 6 LED headlamp for $15. Why spend an additional $20 more for a similar product? I think Petzl is ripping us off."
5,A very fine product,"This is my first purchase of a headlamp so I didn't know what to expect. I am very pleased with the Perzl Tikka light. Although I am an outdoor activist I bought the light to use around the house. It frees up my hands to do things in dim light. Much better than a hand flashlight. The product is well made, light, and very comfortable on the head. The illumination of the lamp is sufficient for my needs."
5,dr_seuss@lajollashores.com,"This album deserves more than just five stars. It deserves a whole lot more. In fact, words can't describe just how powerful this album. And symbols like little stars and stuff can't describe it either. All I can say is that when I was sixteen, smoking loads of dope and completely out of my mind, this album made me realize that the best acid must've been around in the sixties. That part at the end of track three is especially trippy."
3,Half of This Albums Material Is Worth Of Saying Classic !,"Meddle has said to be Pink Floyd's best album after the Syd Barrett's time and before the Dark Side of the Moon. Maybe it is because I have heard only Meddle and Atom Heart Mother on this period. Meddle could be a classic album if you found more interesting and terrific songs as One of These Days and epic Echoes on this album. Unfortunaly, rest of the songs are a quite booring ballads as San Tropez and Seamus. These songs are not bad ones but they don't sit very well on this album. Of cource may people like this peaceful and beautiful songs but I am not one of them. Luckily, Echoes save this album! It is over 22 minutes musical travel trough many feelings and it really shows how skillful musicians Pink Floyd members are."
3,Cool little trick,"Hey- Many of you might already know this, but if you play this album's ""Echos"" at the same time as the segment of 2001: A Space Odyssey titled ""Jupiter and Beyond the Infinate,"" you'll see that it is a perfect match. The song was designed that way, so that the two are in synch. Many people know about the Dark Side of the Moon/Wizard of Oz connection, buy perhaps you haven't heard of this one. Check it out, it works!"
2,Disappointing,"Short and not-sweat.... A good song followed by ""The Beatles"", contiuning with possibly the WORST song I have ever heard or has been recorded and ending with a good song. From all the prior reviews that praised this album, I bought it and was totally disappointed."
2,Nahhhh...............,"Not even close to Dark Side of the Moon, Animals or The Wall, this album shows the Dark Side of PF -packing together 23 minutes of lame sound effects with a couple chords and calling it ""an epic song"" (also known as Echoes). Same can be said of the rest of the album. Oh well, they were good musicians indeed -but anybody can have a faux pas."
2,Slow and squeaky,"It had been years since I'd heard this and thought I would add it to my collection, now I know why it has been years since I listened to it, I'll continue with my CCW, Bob Seger, Fleetwood Mac..."
5,Oldie but goody,This has by far been one of my all time favorite albums...very mellow and precise with a flare for the unknown..
5,"Maybe not the Best Floyd CD, but very close","This is would be a great CD by any standard except when compared to Floyd's later works. If not for the mediocre ""Seamus"" and ""San Tropez"", this release may rank with their very best, but instead it lags just behind DSOTHM, WYWH, A, and TW. You can really hear David Gilmour making a bigger impact on this record. ""One of these Days"" just rocks and the accoustic ""Fearless"" is the best radio song on the album. But ""Echoes"" is a masterpiece. Clocking in around 18 minutes, it sets the stage for their future music on DSOTM and WYWH. I describe it as kind of a jammier, rawer version of ""Shine On.."" (but maybe better?). Meddle is certainly a must have and is worth buying the whole CD for Echoes if nothing else."
5,An echo of things to come...,"This Pink Floyd album is a masterpiece! There is so much range in emotions contained just within these six tracks. The opening track, 'One Of These Days', is a solid electrical soundscape that carries you into a few mellower acoustic tracks. Track 5 is an interesting blues jam complete with howling dog. And then...'Echoes.' This is one of the most amazing songs ever recorded. At 23min, 'Echoes' can take you on the best trip you've ever had OR it can take you on the worst trip you've have ever had (depending on your state of mind.) Don't listen to this song on acid or you may be damaged for life. Then again...Five years after recording Meddle, Pink Floyd once again captured the overall mood of 'Echoes' with the album, Animals. If you like Animals, you will love 'Echoes' and vice versa.Meddle is the perfect companion piece to DSOTM and Animals. Actually, it's the perfect companion piece to your CD-player!!! A must-have for any true music fan."
3,"It's all for ""Echoes""","Yea, I know I really probably shouldn't be reviewing this, since all I ever listen to on this cd is Echoes, but...I must say I've given the other songs their fair chance, and none of them stuck with me or interested me, even after repeat listenings. This is why it gets not 5 or 4 stars, but 3. BUT, if I didn't like Echoes is would get a 1. Echoes...how do you describe it? It starts off sounding like a dripping water faucet, then morphs into a poppy kind of tropical sound: ""Overhead the albatross hangs motionless upon the air"". (The words are great too.) Then the pop sound falls away into just a beat, and then an eerie sound like...well if fog could have a sound that would be it. I won't tell you the about the rest of it, the sounds in the fog, they're just too chilling to describe! So summary: first 5 songs are bland, #6 is a 23 minute long piece of heaven. (Oh...and by the way, listen to it with your eyes closed and the lights off.) Enjoy! :-D"
4,Great Floyd,"opens with Pink Floyd's, and the world's, greatest heavy rock song - One of These Days - an outstanding rollicking, heavy rock instrumental. Also a great opener to PF's ""Collection of Great Dance Songs"" superb compilation album.great PF album, good variety.Echoes is very good, in the early stages maybe the gensis of Dark Side of the Moon ? Later, the haunting strains of guitar and synthesisers. Enjoy this track, just lay back, close the eyes, and listen.Just get it !!"
4,The First Dark Side Of The Moon,"Meddle is not as good as Dark Side, but you could see PINK FLOYD was on to something brilliant, the flow is very smooth and before you know it, the album is over and PINK FLOYD has taken you on a journey, something they are just so amazing at. The album kicks off with a Rocker ONE OF THESE DAY'S a psycadelic grove machine that's led by David Gilmore's terrific slide work, the album get's very dreamy at time's folk like, A PILLOW OF WINDS is so comforting to hear, SAN TROPEZ is jazz lounge like, with a touch of humor, the album seems to have a great cadance to it. Echoes the last song is easily one of my favorite PINK FLOYD songs, i could spend a whole day writing about the song Echoes but i'll spare you, Echoes is part 1 of Dark Side Of The Moon, you can hear it, you can feel that they were on the brink of something truely incredible. Probably the most underated FLOYD album MEDDLE in my book is TOP'S."
4,Pardonable Lies,A great book! I love Maisie! However the Kindle version had so many typos and completly misspelled words. There were more in this book than any other book I've read.
5,I love Maisie Dobbs!,"As with all of the Maisie Dobbs books, this one is beautifully written and I couldn't put it down. The plot twist took me by surprise and I would recommend it to anyone with a taste for historical fiction and / or mystery. Fabulous read!"
4,wonderful novels,"I am enjoying the Masie Dobbs series of books enormously. Each is well crafted and offers an interesting look into England between the world wars. I do hope, though, that Masie finds more joy in the later books. Although, perhaps people who have such intimate knowledge of war cannot be really light hearted again."
2,predictable,"read this book only if you like to figure out your mysteries pages and pages in advance, and have surprise new bad guys thrown in at the end to tie up loose ends."
3,Love the Lady,"We need more inspiration with strong, smart women like Masie who is willing to step outside the mold. Her life experiences all help her to solve the case!"
4,An optimistic blast from the past!,"I admit it-- I really LIKED a lot of the music created for Saturday Morning TV in the late 60's. With that in mind, putting this CD on for the first time was like falling thru a time warp. Originally released in 1970 (between the 3rd & 4th ARCHIES albums) RON DANTE BRINGS YOU UP is an album that really lives up to its name. With the same singer, producer & musicians as THE ARCHIES, these songs are a powerful statement about joy and how wonderful life can be. It also stands as a reminder just how bad the ""kids"" of today really have it-- because no matter how you look at it, in reality there is NOTHING ""cool"" about being cynical and negative. Ron Dante's music is in the same vein as Britney Spears'-- if only HE was getting as much attention! And really-- somebody NEEDS to re-issue those 5 ARCHIE albums in their entirety. They're overdue, I think!"
4,Totally relaxing with a funky edge,I love this album. You can put it on while preparing to go out to get you going or when you are relaxing at home.It has a unique beats and the tunes are catchy but never tiresome.I thoroughly reccommend it as a MUST HAVE for your collection.
5,Timeless groove...,"Eagerly sought out after the 1st LP. D-I deliver the goods on their sophomore LP. There's a confidence and self assuredness in the arrangements and while the music is rooted in soul, there's no typecasting their sound. The band provide a history lesson by fluidly running through the spectrum of Funk. I would liken them to a modern day Rufus or Earth, Wind and Fire. Sarah Ann Webb's husky pipes and arrangements have improved especially on the jazz funk of ""Midnight"", the disco of ""Always"", the urgent aching balladry of ""Should I?"", the early 80's synth-funk of ""Phunky Times"" and the jazz torch swagger of ""Your All I Need"". There's even some Soca thrown in for good measure. Overlooked, underrated but highly recommended."
5,SIMPLY GREAT!!,"JEOPARDY IS MY ALWAYS FAVORITE TV GAME AND THIS IS THE WAY TO BE PART OF IT AND LEARN AT THE SAME TIME, I STRONGLY RECOMMEND IT."
1,Multiple Choice and no Alex kill this game,This game is worse than versions from 10 years ago. The questions are not read to you and it is MULTIPLE CHOICE. This game is nothing like Jeopardy.
3,Frustrating!,"I usually do pretty well with the TV version of Jeopardy. However, these questions are HARD! I don't mind the multiple choice because they aren't shown until you click 'respond' so you have to have somewhat of an idea before you choose to answer. I don't know a whole lot about kings and astrology and it seems a lot of hard categories come up. I'm a college graduate with a 4.0 and a teacher and in no way a dummy but this game frustrates me!"
2,Misrepresented,This is not the Jeopardy I was expecting! There is no multiple choice in Jeopardy! Where is Alex Trebeck? My old Jeopardy games (1998 and 2000 editions) were more along the lines of the original Jeopardy game where Alex Trebeck read the questions. I was very disappointed in this game. Is there another version of the real Jeopardy (no multiple choice) coming out in the near future? Thank you and I look forward to your reply.Marilyn Goodwinmimigoo416@yahoo.com
3,It's OK,"I played the Jeopardy online for a while with my family and after some time we reached a point where we went through all the categories and decided to buy this game. It is definitely better graphically than the online version with more questions, but we already had a few categories come up twice. That is kind of disappointing because the whole point of purchasing the new game was so that it asked new questions. We still haven't played long enough to go through all the categories, but I am hoping it doesn't happen soon."
1,Warning. Requires CD in computer everytime,"I get very irritated, when I have to find the CD, take it out of the case, insert it in the computer, play the game (the only part not irritating), eject the CD, put it in the case, store it where i can find next time. Then do all this again to play the next game."
3,good,its a good fun game but i have it only for about a month and when i play my computer freezes on me and can take a while till i can reboot
1,terriable!!!!!!!,I did all the research it was in consummer reports. I also read all the reviews. This car seat is a awful!!!!! My son hated it the minute I put him in it. The strapes kept falling off his shoulders. He could also wiggle through the double strap. If you need to clean this seat forget it you will never get the lower cushion off without unscrewing the back of the car seat. Also the knob to tighten the strapes is to hard to reach because it gets stuck into the seat. When I first bought this seat I thought it was great but once I needed to wash it and deal with the straps it became a night mare. I need to buy another car seat but I'm not sure what to do because I thought I did my home work for this seat and It turned out to be nothing but a hassle. Sorry evenflo this seat stinks!!!!!
1,Mom developed injury due to tension knob,"Got this seat in May, and by June I had bad wrist pain from the tension knob. In November I realized its from twisting the tension knob multiple times daily! I replaced the seat with the Cosco Alpha Omega (love this seat, no knob!)I saw an orthopedic physician & he said its De Quervain's disease. Yesterday I finally got a cortisone shot, as it got so bad I can't move my thumb, lift my baby without pain, or open a jar.And I'm a fitness instructor, so its not like I'm some weak whiner with fragile joints or anything!This seat was otherwise a great buy, and I put it in my husband's car, since he rarely uses it, but if you start to get achy wrists---exchange it! The only cure for De Quervain's is to stop the motion altogher. (mine went on for months before I figured it out, so if the cortisone shot doesn't work, I'll have to have surgery)I will be calling evenflo."
2,Difficult Harness,"I returned this seat after 1 day because the harness was way too difficult to tighten and loosen. Rather than pull the strap you have to turn a knob to tighten and push a lever to release. It was extremely hard to do and not worth that amount of effort! I went back to BRU to see if it was just ours that was possibly defective, and the salesman said people return this seat all the time for the same reason. So I bought the Britax Roundabout."
2,Hate the straps,"I also did a ton of research and saw that this and the Britax Marathon were equally rated, the only difference being price. So I purchased the Evenflo and loved the look and how cushy it was. However, after a few days of working the straps I'm just overly frustrated and am returning it for the Britax which has the strap adjustments same as my old Graco infant seat. With this seat rear facing I have a heck of a time turning the strap loosener because it's buried into my seat. And the whole double strap harness is just too much trouble. It seemed everytime I raised the strap to get my baby out, the straps tightened down even more to where I could barely get it buckled again, even though it is touted as a memory adjuster. Just too much trouble to deal with when I'm running 3-4 errands at a time."
1,safety concerns,I bought this car seat for my son who is now 13 months old when he was 7 months old. It is difficult to get the baby into and I also had a safety concern with this seat. My son would lift the cover and pick at the styrofoam. I had to call Evenflo and they sent me a replacement which is the newer model that has clips on the cover so baby cannot get to the styrofoam. If you are planning on buying this seat I would suggest buying the Envenflo Triumph and make sure there are clips to secure the cover.
3,This is too difficult!!,"My Husband and I bought this after looking at all the car seats. This one was the only one that had real padding and seemed to be comfortable. This was also supposed to be good in safety ratings. I have two complaints. 1.If you needed to pull the cover off to wash it you have to unscrew the back to get the cover and straps off. 2. The straps don't seem to come out very far and difficult to deal with. My daughter isn't small and it seems like she would out grow this too quickly. In all this car seat just seemed to be too difficult. We took it back and got the Eddie Bauer Manchester Car Seat. We had this one for my son who is now almost 5 and he still fits it. If the company would change a few things on this, I think it would be a great car seat."
5,Expensive brand names aren't always the best!!!!,"At 9 months my daughter was ready to move out of her infant seat and I was, like many others who have reviewed this car seat, ready to buy the Britax at $250-300. SO GLAD I RESEARCHED FURTHER!!!!!! Per Consumer Reports and many happy reviewers, this car seat is JUST AS GOOD, if not BETTER than the Britax. The Britax may have beat out the Evenflo by just a bit, but the Evenflo did BETTER in car crash testing and there is no comparison in comfort!!!!! I know every time I strap in my daughter she couldn't be in a safer seat . . . and the bonus - it was HALF the price of the BRITAX!!!!!!!The ONLY downside I've found so far, this seat is a bit on the heavy side. We rarely move it from my SUV since that's the vehicle we typically drive, so at this point it's not an issue. Worse case scenario, I'll buy another one and still not paid more than I would have for the Britax!!!!!"
5,By far the BEST car seat!,"My husband and I each have one in our car for our 15 month old daughter. I wish EvenFlo would come out with a PERFECT infant carrier so that we can purchase it when we have our next child.THis is by far the best carseat. It's easy to install, easy to clean, easy to adjust. Everything is EASY! I don't know who has to unscrew anything to get the cover off. We have no problem removing it. I recommend this to anyone who wants a safe and reliable car seat!"
4,Beautiful Uplifting Soundscapes from David Tibet,"This cd is a return to Tibet's earlier soundscape endeavor's, yet it is infused with Tibet's new uplifting sound. Those who liked the peice ""Sucking up Souls"" from _In Menstrual Nights_ and the ""hopeful"" sounds of _Thunder: Perfect Mind_ and _Of Ruine or Some Blazing Star_ should love this cd."
1,Bugs!!,"I was disgusted to see live bugs crawling around inside of the plastic of several of these packages!! (You should be aware that there are ten yellow frizbees filled with biscuits and covered with clear plastic.) I have no idea what kind of insects these are infested with, I just wanted them out of my house right away, YUCK!!!!! A most unpleasant experience!!!!!I have contacted Amazon and been assured of a full refund."
1,Doggie Treats,I purchased a case and the dogs loved them. The bad part is I had to throw them all away because they were infested with moths. However when the Doggie De Lite folks saw this review they contacted me and replaced my order. Great customer service and a great product.
3,It's ok,"Would have been great if... there wasn't a scratch in it. If one of the round discs glued to glass didn't come off! For as simple as it is, you would think they could have a better build quality."
2,Sharpeners are supposed to sharpen,"Wasn't able to sharpen my axe or any of my knives. Several different attempts and trials, all with no avail. Useless to me. Out to the goodwill it goes."
4,Handy axe sharpener,"I bought this sharpener together with my Fiskars X 27. It is lightweight, handy and easy to store. I've used it a few times on the X 27 and the resulting edge is very sharp and readily produced after only a few passes through the sharpener.So far so good."
4,Quick sharpener,"Does a pretty good job for quick sharpening in the field or on the fly. I use it for machetes and bush axes. Think for knives would want a better edge. As other reviewers mentioned, if you have a curved blade, it does cut into the plastic in the slot. Pretty good for around $10 though."
3,Fiskars Knife sharpener,"It is simple to use and relatively safe. I feel that it could do a better job of finish work on the blade of my pocket knife, though."
5,knives and axes?,eh? You seriously think I'm going to use the same thing to sharpen the Henckels 4 star knives I use to prepare family meals AND the axes I use to chop wood?Seriously. This sharpener will reset just about any blunted knife or axe to a finely honed edge.It does just a good a job on a fine filleting knife as it does on my favorte chopping axe - I just have to remember to clean it before I switch uses.Now if only they made a lawnmower that could julienne vegetables....
3,Ok,Wish it worked better on smaller knifes but does work well with my axe. It could just be the operator.
1,CHEAP,"JUNK. Good concept, poor performance. Barely sharpens hunting knife and takes forever to just notice a difference in the blade. Don't even try to do an ax blade (like it claims you can)...you will look like a fool fumbling with this little inferior piece of crap for hours. Perhaps it would work great on a little pocket knife...but a good rock would probably do just as well."
4,Good for the Price,If you are looking for a good sharpener in this price range then this is it. It does a good job on my Fiskars Chopping Axe. I am not sure how good it would do on knives. I have only used it on my axe. But for the price this is a good sharpener.
3,Good sharpener,"Got this to sharpen a Friskars axe I have. Does the job decently, not much more I can say about it."
4,Great sharpener,It's a little too big to take camping with you but it's great to keep in a survival kit. It has a stone wheel that sharpens both sides of the blade at once. The wheel is removable.
4,"Quick, easy, basic sharpener","This sharpener will put an edge on your axe pretty quickly. I took my Gerber Camp axe that was pretty dull and had it sharp in appx 50 back and forth strokes. Now, it's not shaving sharp, and I couldn't use it to shave, but it was plenty sharp enough for the purpose of chopping logs and cutting branches.The sharpener itself is a nice design that utilizes a roller mechanism that sharpens as you move the axe back and forth, so it sharpens fairly quickly. It has a removable sharpening mechanism that I guess is to clean and/or replace the sharpening blades at some point. As another viewer noted, the axe blade has the propensity to slice into the housing plastic over time, but this sharpener should last plenty long and does the job quickly and easily."
5,Brave Little Titmouse,"Dr. Grubb, the author, really gets inside the world of tufted titmice. This is everything you could ever hope to know about the brave, charming little bird and its habits, and with such glorious photographs besides. I got the book for my neighbor Karen who had a titmouse protecting his territory by flying into her window at his image -- which he thought was a rival. She loved the book. I highly recommend this thoroughly researched book."
4,Great cd for metal lovers,"Wow, I'm surprised at the above reviews for this great cd. Personally I think ""Doomed to Inherit"" is better than their first cd (Redemption) in the respect of musicianship and outside influences. And no one mentions the new drummer Elex Marquez? This guy smokes!!! Grind, death and extreme metal all combine to make this one hell of a release. I happily recommend it to all who want to list to some great heavy metal. Divine Empire has let go of the past and forge on with a metal sound all their own. Can't wait to see 'em live!!JW"
4,very helpful,"i don't know if i agree with all of the information, but the hints and tips to overcome them seemed sensible. (i haven't tried any yet, though)"
3,Heal your Body review,The book arrived in perfect shape and in reasonable amount of time. I am not sure about the accuracy of the content of the book.
3,"Great resource, indecipherable format.","I downloaded the Kindle edition of this book today and it's barely readable beyond the introductory pages. In the A-Z section, the three column set-up is mashed together and almost impossible at times to decipher. I'll be looking for a better format."
5,Great way to clear old patterns!,"If you have picked up this title you are probably familiar with Louise Hay's premise that all dis-ease, at is core, is a belief or thought one has within themselves. This book has the name of the dis-ease, the core possibility of belief and then a positive affirmation to re-direct that belief. That is great! It is simple, easy to understand and use as a reference book. Sometimes, I write the positive thought or affirmation many times over and over, only to discover that the ailment is gone. I definitely recommend anyone in alternative medicine or healing practice use this book as one for reference."
5,"Study Guide for ""Come into My Trading Room""",Study guide is a great complement to the book. It is a great help for digesting the material.
5,One of the most usefull studyguide I have ever seen...,"Above all the 2nd part of this StudyGuide is usefull and excellent, with many charts with entry/exit points.I would like here to underline, with regard to the first review, that Dr Elder never talked about Bollinger Bands but ONLY about Envelopes, a totally different concept. I can assure you that when there is a good trend to go long/short at the middle line with the take profit at the upper/lower band is definetely a good technique..."
5,The cable you need,The cable does exactly what it should do and the price is good. Metal clip is a big advantage.
5,Good Length,I thought it was not going to be long enough at 1st but it will run all the way to where I need in my tower so I guess my main point is it is exactly at it is described and does what it's supposed too.
1,A Huge Disappointment,"Like most people, I loved the original Friday - a true classic. I had heard that this one wasn't as good, so I rented a copy just to check it out for myself.This movie is straight-up garbage. Mike Epps can't carry Chris Tucker's jock. What a waste of what could have been a very good movie series.Stick with the original; don't waste your time or money on this one."
2,Funny,The DVD was in perfect condition. It was not as funny as Friday but was fun to watch.Friday was the best when they sat around the hood. Friday after Next was better than Next Friday.But it was good to see all three.
2,Disappointing,"As a very big fan of Friday, I was very disappointed that Next Friday did not provide the same laughs, or nearly as many. Don't get me wrong, it has its share of chuckles, but don't expect another riot like the original. I don't think that Mr. Cube compensated for the loss of Smokey."
5,Too Funny,"I saw, this today I liked, it lots of swearing NOT FOR LITTLE KIDS but funny, you'll laugh...."
5,"HELLO? the cast is great, but what about.....","JOKER? talk about someone making the movie, Jacob Vargas was great! If you went through the whole ""ghetto"" stage, as many young people do, you would remember him from ""Mi Vida Loca"". His appearance in this movie was a pleasant surprise & he was great! I didn't miss smokey at all, the new entertaining characters made up for it & then some, i was expecting a dull unneeded sequel, but was surprised by a movie funnier than the first!"
3,not bad,"This film was ok, but it could have been so much better. I think that some more time working on a better plot and some more comedy would have made this movie as good or better than the first."
1,THIS MOVIE SUX,"All I will do is name all funny bits: .......................THIS SUX, I advise anyone with half brain not to purchase this garbage. I actually used this disk as toilet paper, after I'd watched it once. Ice Cube is a dude, but this? Three Kings to This. No thats funny. The chris Tucker wannabe was so un funny that I scanned over his scenes. One thing this disk does do, is make an ideal frisby. This is one of those films you wait till it comes on tv to watch it again."
5,Great Bird ID guide,"This is my second purchase of this book as the first one was used so much it was in bad shape. I use it all the time to ID birds at my yard feeders. Clear photos of both male and female of each breed and detailed descriptions of the bird, their feeding habit and migration. Highly recommend for bird watchers."
4,A wonderful trip back in time -- with young singers as guides,"This is an amazing album, particularly to one unused to the form or the era. Listening with ""fresh ears,"" untainted by more traditional recordings of the works, I was astonished at the ability of the singers to create wonderful harmonies, soothing transitions, and yet articulate the words so clearly that they could be understood. The music itself transcends its time and space, and can speak to us now. The performances were superb."
5,An exceptional and Moving Experience,"This first offering from British vocal group stile antico is an exceptional listening experience. Beautiful and soothing, the vocals on this CD are ouststanding. This is a 5-star listen through and through. Also enjoyable is the booklet that comes with the CD explaining Compline and the 16th century composers whose music is featuered on the CD.Highly recommended. This is a 5 star treat, don't miss this one."
3,"Well, at least they're original","I'm not going to make a speech, but at least Pink Floyd was original enough to come up with thier own style"
5,"""...The lunatic is on the grass""","In my opinion, this is one album that EVERYONE should own. My mom is a huge Pink Floyd fan, so I grew up listening to this album more times than can be counted. Most concept albums are sort of a chore to sit through and the message is so confusing, it's hard to understand just what a band is trying to say. This is not the case with Dark Side of the Moon. Listening to this album all the way through is so great, that you wish there was MORE! Obviously there are some songs that stand out just as well by themselves (Time, Brain Damage) but they sound so much better being complimented by the instrumentals (The Great Gig In the Sky is such an amazing song). Personally, I think you will get a better sense of the band by buying this CD, rather than picking up their whopping 2 disc greatest hits collection. This is an album no music fan should be without. Go out and buy a copy for you and everyone you know."
2,Songs End Early on Live Versions,Why does every song end early on the live version? It ruins the music and leaves the listener hanging. Very poor...
5,Nice guitar work,"The guitar solos in ""Money"" outrank anything I've ever heard in rock. The piercing, squealing, wailing licks cut right through your head like an atomic laser through cotton candy. That's my story and I'm stickin' to it."
5,Why the 1 star?,"I know people have the right to their own opinions about music and that I should not criticize. However, giving Dark Side of the Moon only one star is really going too far! 1 star means a truly god-awful album. 5 would be outstanding. Okay, if you don't like it you don't like it, but DSoTM should be respected. If you don't believe me look at the album sales and how long it has been of the billboards."
2,Use only as directed,"All those people sitting around smoking pot (as you need to do to have the patience to sit through some of this stuff) and synchronising this thing to ""The Wizard of Oz"" need to get a life. It's probably a three star album, not a two, but the silly habits of its fans annoy me enough to pull a star."
5,I'll see you on the dark side of the moon.,the lunatic is on the grassthe lunatic is on the grassremembring games and daisy chains and laughsgot to keep the loonies on the paththe lunitic is in the hallthe lunitics are in my hallthe paper holds there folded faces to the floorevery day the paper boy brings moreand if the dam breaks open many years to soonand if there is no room upon the hilland if you head explodes with dark forbidings toi'll see you on the dark side of the moon
3,another reissue just for money...,"Dark Side of the Moon deserves 5 stars of course. The actual music content. As for this 'remastered' version, you aren't getting anything different than the original, which is fine. No need to change a flawless album, but don't reissue it for the 10th time then. Honestly, what got to me the most is the fact that the case is just paper and not an actual hard case. This is why people steal music is because it's not worth it to buy the physical album when they're as cheaply made as possible and they have no interest for the fan. I don't blame pink floyd, but whoever the publishers are.Anyways, in conclusion... legendary album as always, pointless remaster/reissue and flimsy cheap case."
4,"""I'll see you on the dark side of the moon.......""Great line........","This is by far one of the greatest albums of all time!Don't hate dark side finatics,but this is only my fourth favorite Pink Floyd album,beaten by The Wall(the greatest album ever)Meddle(musically the best album of all time)and Animals(musically the 2nd greatest album of all time).Sue me.Despite that,I reccomend this album to any fan of the oldies or just,ANYONE!!!!!!!!"
5,This is a must for any music collection,"David Gilmours solo in ""time"" is the most haunting, disturbing, and outstanding piece of guitar work I've ever heard. I believe it even surpasses his solos in ""comfortably numb"" from the Wall. This music is timeless, and appeals to a wide variety of listeners. If you don't have it, buy it!"
2,This is not the recent re-issue. This package is from a few years ago.,"This pressing is horrible. It is very noisy. Do not confuse this with the 2011 version, which by all accounts sounds great."
1,Don't Bother,"It was great to see this released on vinyl. Only problem is, I should have read the reviews before buying it. Sounds like the master they used to make this was someones old scratched version. Exchanged it for another, same problem. Getting a refund. It's great that Amazon stands behind what they sell. Don't waste your money on this one. PS - Got Wish You Were Here and it sounds great."
4,Another reason to buy: The Wizard of Oz phenomenon.,"I can't give any recommendation that the previous 530 reviewers have. But scrolling through their reviews I haven't seen any mention of the Wizard of Oz phenomenon.In a bizarre coincidence, the song program on 'Dark Side' synchronizes with some scene changes and plot turns in the classic movie 'Wizard of Oz'. You have to hit the 'start' button on the CD player at the right moment --- at the end of the MGM lion's third roar at the beginning of the film. I've done this and some of the coincidences are striking, especially the tornado/'Great Gig in the Sky' sequence.For more information, look on the internet. There are several sites devoted to this and other Pink Floyd/movie synchronicities. They give specific coincidences, including song lyrics which (supposedly) comment on the action in the film (stretching things a bit) but it helps to have a guide.Hey, another benefit of the CD for the undecided shopper."
3,"Different,,,,i'll give it that","After thoroughly listening to this album a couple times through, I just concluded that this is mediocre stuff at best. Sound effects override actual music, which is not too respectable for musicians. The first two tracks seem like something out of star wars or something. When I think of Lennon and Macca spending hours perfecting their harmony and writing melodies, this stuff seems extremely sophomoric. Lines like ""money, it's a gas, grab the cash with two hands and make a stash""---gag--- extremely lame lyrics. This album is NOT what it is reputed to be."
2,I just could never get into this album,"I was maybe, 17 when this album came out. Me and my friends were all into music and would proudly play our new albums to each other and go to the big concerts. I was the perfect target market at the time and I already liked pyschedelic music by Hendrix and others but somehow I could never get into this album and still don't care to listen to it even though it has been impossible to escape from at times. Maybe it was all the clanging clocks, the ""listen to what my new synth can do"" tracks or the chick in the shower vocal exercise that really turned me off, though there are some good pieces of music contained here; all this stuff just seemed like sound effects junk to me, and I can't really recommend this album as whole."
4,Why should I review this,"You've heard the songs one way or the other, you know what to expect except that they redid the album so that it would sound better so.....? Do I need to say anymore. Shall I mention that I love On The Run and no matter how I want to say I hate this since it's so popular I just can't. It's infectious but I still retain that this album is not as good as Meddle and any of the ones before this - it's not even as good as Animals but it is still really good. In the end - you will buy this album and despite trying to hate it you will actually possibly begin to like it and well......maybe reviews for this album are a pointless thing after allOh and let's set the record straight.....they were not on drugs...if you thought that they were I'd hate to imagine your reaction to Piper At The Gates Of Dawn.....that really was a druggy album but it was because of Syd Barrett and not the rest of the band but that's a different story"
5,My 45 minutes of Ecstacy,"Listening to Dark Side of the Moon is like eating chocolate for 45 minutes straight. I would have to say it is one of, if not THE best rock album ever recorded. Pink Floyd wonderfullly uses the element of timing, and waiting perfectly. They know exactly when to come in, for how long, and how to end it. The whole album is like a complete work, not a bunch of different songs, so, therefore there are no 'bad' songs. It all fits perfectly building up to the finale: Brain Damage/Eclipse. I have never heard Pink Floyd before, I picked up this album, and I was an instant fan. I was obsessed, I now have to buy every single album and know everything about them. ANYONE, with the exception of people with really bad taste (i.e. anyone that likes any of these sellout punk/rock bands) can cherish this album. I am 14 and I think this is a little bit of heaven--right next to Miles Davis's Kind Of Blue. THIS ALBUM IS A MUST FOR ANYONE! ANYONE!"
4,This is a good CD. A must for any classis rock collection.,"I tried to play this CD and watch The Wizard of Oz, and I only found it to coincide with the movie a few, seemingly coincidental, times. The music is excellent anyways, though. In fact, it is one of my favorite CDs. ""Money"" is a classic."
5,My favorite album of all time,"Dark Side of the Moon is the first Pink Floyd album I bought, and it's by far my favorite. This is the album that got me hooked to Floyd. Songs like ""Time"" and ""Brain Damage"" have a lilting tune to them that sticks in your mind, and the way each song blends with the rest is one of the things that makes this CD a masterpiece. The entire CD is almost like a story, and you can't help but listen to the whole thing at once. BUY THIS CD."
5,Floyd Rules,Possibly one of the best albums of all time. I can listen to this every day and still be amazed at Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon.
5,Quit reading and buy it,Quite simply the best audio i've ever heard. I NEVER get tired of listening to it in SACD. The best one out there hands down. Buy it now.
1,poor packaging - poor cd print,Poor Packaging and the CD's have a very very very low print quality. 120$ is too way expensive for this box.I do not recommend it.
1,"""Unbelievable"" quality",Just got my copy of this record. I was really hoping I wouldn't get damaged pressing as it has been with many unsatisfied customers whose complaints I have read here after I have ordered this item. But the miracle didn't happened. My copy of this record has many visible defects on its surface. You can almost constantly hear some disturbing noises during the process of playback on the both sides of the record. It is so frustrating. I am so disappointed with this purchase.
5,The Greatest Album of all Time,"This isn't 'one of the greatest albums of all time', it is THE greatest album of all time! I want this album to be played at my funeral. When you listen to this work of art, sit back with your eyes closed and think about your life. It will bring you to tears."
5,A Great Floyd,"If I had to rate a million stars on Dark Side Of The Moon, I would not hesitate. It's the progressive music on the highest path. If you have a discman, listen to it immediately and try to land on the nearest airport."
3,ONE OF THOSE ALBUMS...,"THis is one of those albums that, it seems, you're not aloud to give a review that not be a five stars rating. But I don't care. For me, this is just another great Floyd album, but THE WALL and even THE FINAL CUT are better."
1,Worst album of all-time!,"SNORE. I can't believe some of you dorky stoners trapped in the '70s have the nerve to call this album a ""masterpiece"" or ""one of the best albums of all-time""! LOL, MUSIC NERDS! You people can't be serious. They didn't even get any MTV or BET airplay. Therefore, they automatically are horrible. I suggest you listen to a great album like ""St.Anger"" by Metallica or ""Lost Highway"" by Bon Jovi if you want a taste of what real music should sound like."
1,Subversive communist filth,"This cacophony of commie buzz words and simplistic, condescending communist ideals both offends me as an American, and as a music listener. Should've been called Red Side Of the Moon."
5,Pink Floyd at its best,"As a huge Pink Floyd fan, I think Dark Side is one of the albums you must listen to. Its dark from beginning to end, but has some massive guitar riffs and pulsating lyrics."
3,Pink Floyd DSOM,The item was shipped on time and received in good shape. Thanks and keep up the professionalism you espouse to. I'm rebuilding my older record collection.Dave Iossi
5,Fantastic album,"Dark Side of the Moon is generally regarded as one of the greatest rock albums ever produced, and it's not hard to see why. Not a bad song on the entire album, it works best when you listen to it from start to end, uninterrupted. EVERYONE should have this album, Floyd fan or not. It's a concept album about all different areas of life; life, death, money, insanity,etc. 'Money' and 'Us and Them' are brilliant and world famous. 'Time' (the second song with singing) is also superb. My favourite is definitely 'Brain Damage', which contains my favourite line in music: ""And if the band you're in starts playing different tunes, (I'll see you on the dark side of the moon""). The way I figure it, if that happens, you're really stuffed! It's all finished off with the fantastic 'Eclipse', which sought of rounds up everything the album has been preaching. Simply brilliant, it is the best album to start with if you haven't heard (I feel sorry for you if you haven't) Pink Floyd before."
5,Holy cow!,"If you have never heard anything by Pink Floyd, Led Zeppelin, the Doors, or the like, listen to this and you are sold! If you sit down and listen to this from start to finish, it is almost frightening it can be (and is)."
5,Dark Side of the Moon was Digitally recorded,"--Genevieve Williams wrote:1973 was before the advent of digital recording techniques.Just to set the record straight, this album was digitally recorded in 1973, on digital tape and won a Grammy for Alan Parson for engineering.There are two versions for sale, analog and digital, get the digital version.Truly a classic.'Us and Them' is my fav.This album also adresses many social issues, as do 'Wish You Were Here' and 'The Wall'.They were years ahead of their time with regards to the digital age. I doubt many others were recorded digitally at that time.z1robbie"
3,Live version not too great.,"I bought this to get the live version of the album. Compared to ""Pulse"" album, it does not even come close in quality."
5,"The older I get, the better the album gets!","The Dark Side Of The Moon - one of the greatest albums ever made, if not THE GREATEST! In the list of best-selling albums, it comes in at number three, and that is up against some stiff competition. And how do you make an album like that even better? Remaster it!What can I say? You know who Pink Floyd are - those British masters of progressive rock. This is some of their greatest works - Money, Eclipse, and Us And Them (my absolute favorite song of all time). The nice thing is that the older I get, the better the album gets! I highly recommend it!"
2,Ummm...you mean this is it?,"When I first heard DSOFTM was going to be re-released in box form I was through the roof in excitement. I thought, finally they're gonna open the vaults. Well, that didn't happen. To all those hard core PF fans out there I say: Save your money! Unless of course your missing a scarf and marbles to add to your collection. You have heard EVERYTHING that is presented here before. The one piece of music that is truly great is the live disk, which is simply terrific. I was hoping to see more. More unreleased tracks, more alternative mixes... just more damn it! I love the Floyd and will always be a fan, but this is a huge disappointment and doesn't offer much more than what you've already heard. Damn, this could have been great."
4,Very Funny,I enjoyed the series on PBS in the early eighties (I believe it was filmed in the late seventies). It easily surpasses the typical TV sitcoms in comedic value. The actual rating should be four and a half stars. The only problem is that I cannot find the series on tape anywhere.Another viewer stated that this tape contains the first three shows; that is incorrect--this tape contains the first show only.
4,good,"lock is working fine for a few months, it is doing what it was intended to do and I have no complaints about it, jose"
1,"Don't get this, bought mine - just watched for 10minutes before switching it off","I wish I had read reviews on this before purchasing this DVD. I was hoping to watch a documentary about Tibet and not some person telling me how he got came to produce soundtracks with some visual that happened to be Tibet. Never in my imagination that some people would place this DVD for sale. It's likened to someone had just been to Tibet, captured some shots with his camcorder and decided to write some accompanying soundtrack to facilitate the whole viewing. There is nothing wrong with it - just that the viewer expects to know more about Tibet - it's places, how the natives live and not how he came to write his soundtrack. The DVD should be sold as soundtrack of xx with viewings of Tibet to accompany the album."
4,A very enjoyable read,"This was a very enjoyable read, as are many of Elena Greene's books. I especially liked the hero, Marcus. He was basically everything I would want in a romance hero.. I am tired of Regencies where the hero is a ""rake."" He seemed like a genuinely good guy, and multi-dimensional. It is a well written FULL length romance, and a steal at $.99"
1,Charming????,I'm sorry to say that this book was probably the driest book I've read in a long time. I have not read any other books by Elena Greene but I'm not tempted to read any more of them. I think the plot could have worked but somehow the heroine turns in to boring person after she leaves the opera and the hero into a ninny. There was no passion in this book and I really had to force myself to finish the book.
5,"Moving lyrics, powerful vocals, snappy melodies","Billy Mann's music connects with you in ways you can't imagine... Billy's words reach deep into your heart and make you feel happy, excited, nervous, and heart-broken. You'll marvel at how someone can write songs that talk to you the way Billy Mann does. His voice is phenomenal and the music sticks in your head. I hear something new everytime I listen..."
5,A voice and music that is both original and captivating.,"""Earthbound,"" Billy Mann's follow-up to his first cd, once again spotlights his ability to put creatively crafted lyrics and music together with his incredible voice. Backed by a talented group of musicians, Billy is a ""Storyteller"" whose stories should be heard by all."
3,"Bjork ""Hidden Place"" U.K. CD Single Part 1","This is a 3-Track CD single from the U.K. that comes in a standard album-style jewel case with a front insert (but no back insert). The tracks are as follows:1. Hidden Place (Edit): At my first listen I was thinking, ""wow this is really edited nicely, I can't even tell where they cut parts out of it""...utnil the end, whcih is the WORST ending they could have produced for this song. Instead of fading out, the song ABRUPTLY ends. It's like a slap in the face if you've heard the album version. I thought there was an error on my disc when i first heard the song end.2. Generous Palmstroke: Good B-Side. Kind of has an Asian vibe going.3. Verandi: Another B-Side. The previous one was softer than this one. This one has more beats."
1,Non-dancers need not apply!,"If you've never taken a dance class this video is not for you! The moves are complicated and change very quickly. The instructor in the second part (weights and aerobics) screws up and subsequently the class seems less than synchronized much of the time. The third part's instructor speaks too low to be heard so she wears a headset microphone. As a result, you hear every breath and ""popping p"" throughout the section.I'm sorry I bought this tape. Try The Firm videos instead, they really work."
4,Totally unique way of toning,"This tape is revolutionary in the way Jennifer Kries teaches you to tone your body. She incorporates many different styles (yoga, dance, Joseph Pilates) to give you an overall toned body. It is difficult to get used to in the first few workouts, but after that, you will be hooked!"
5,Great purchase,"This book was well worth the money. It not only includes great pictures of his work, it also includes information about his life. The order they are placed in allows you to compare his work that takes place around the same time. It also includes his other works, such as jewelry and sculptures. I would definitely suggest this for anyone who asks."
5,Excellently,"The detailed comments written with feeling.Illustrations reflect all stages of creativityThe book, worthy any collection"
3,SHAUN OF THE... BUGS?...,"Giant insectoids invade Earth, wrapping the populace in cocoons. A small band of survivors must try to repel the onslaught. This movie is sort of SHAUN OF THE DEAD w/ bugs instead of zombies, and far less humour. The critters are well-realized, but the story seems rather rushed, especially toward the end. Still, it's not a bad attempt at sci-fi / monster comedy..."
1,Buyer beware,"Ok. So I'm the lone descenting reviewer. The one saying- What movie are these other guys talking about. But these are the facts: This is not a Horror movie. It tries mostly to work as a comedy but fails at this as well. The creatures move aroung like big, wind-up toys. If you're a Horror fan, take a pass on this. I tried real hard to see this movie through but I had to eject it from my machine.I was lucky. I got this via Netflix and was glad to return it. I recommend you do the same before deciding to purchase."
1,Disappointing,"This book is disappointing for the hefty price tag. The book is not substantial and most of the exercises are gimicky, perhaps fun for someone who wants to create ""How did you do that photos"" but of little value for a serious photographer. Also, unlike most manuals in this price range, the exercises are not in the book but must be downloaded from a web site. Without a high speed hook up this is an arduous task. Plus you must buy Winzip for another $... if you don't have it."
4,great vacation book,"Pack this one in your suitcase. I did and it was great diversion on the plane. Couldn't put it down. The characters, while not as exciting as Katrina in the author's first book, really get to you and the plot is terrific."
2,Disappointing,"Though this book has its moments, it is more or less a pale imitation of Altman's first thriller, A GATHERING OF SPIES. It doesn't have the edge, the thrill of the chase so well done in the first book. All in all, it's slightly boring. Hope that #3 will again take us back to the excitement of A GATHERING OF SPIES."
2,Nice try but failed again!,"Safron's 1st novel, 'A Gathering of Spies' demonstrated his lack of knowledge of WWII. This book is equally as bad except for improved character development. This is a not a chapter turner, you can put this book down in the middle of a chapter and never even miss it.Ray Fisher, Auburn, NY"
1,These are Cosmetic Seconds,"In spite of what the description says, these socks are cosmetic seconds. They are clearly marked as such. They have defects. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!"
1,Worst zapper ever.,The plastic case surrounding the light has terribly small grid spacing... only the smallest gnats can actually make it to the coil. Unbelievably bad product.
1,Was great! For 2 weeks that is..,"This bug zapper was working great when I first got it. Within a few days, there were'nt any noticeable bugs flying around the house. After about 2 weeks though, the bulb is partially burnt out. It only glows in the center of the tube, and doenst attrack bugs anymore. I will be contacting the manufacturer to replace this for me, and I am dissapointed it's quality was so poor."
1,"""sparks"" non-stop","I think the unit is defective. It sparks every second it is plugged in, and it's not bugs making it spark. I unplugged it. Tonight: the trash bin."
3,Too far removed from the original story,"Hmm, for a series that started out strongly it sadly went a little off the rails in this final season in particular. I forgave the killing of Elizabeth as I thought Uncle Malcolm was fantastic - but this series has many storylines that were not in LM Montgomery's original novels and that taint the fantastic trilogy.I think my biggest problem is the dealing of Perry (one of my favourite characters) and the very adult themes in this series - it is no longer the family friendly series it began as. Also I didn't like that there was no firm conclusion to wrap things up the way it should have been.Watch it if you have followed the series - but be warned it is not in the spirit of Montgomery."
5,Against the Wind cd Bob Seger,"i am so grateful to add this to my music collection it has been one of my favorite Bob Segers release ..however i found out his newest releasefirst in a long while "" FACE THE PROMISE"" Bob shows his songwriting and singing have only gotten better with time ... worth the wait ....""Against the Wind"" will always have a special place in my heart..."
4,the best and the greatest !!,"i have had this album for years,now i own it on cd,and everybody should have a copy of this album in some way shape or form ,just fantastic,some of the best of bob seger,one of his greatest works,this albun is a must have for anyone that enjoys great classic soft and hard rock music,"
3,Against the Wind,"The CD I got is a ""digitally remastered"" version of the original. It seems to me that they took the opportunity to smooth out the rough edges in Seger's voice, like the used to do to Roger Daltry.I like the album but feel that it is missing something."
5,wore out the tape,"I like this album so much I wore out my tape years ago. It gives me hope comfort and energy. Most listeners who like the Seger, Mellancamp, and Petty will enjoy this too. Now I know why I could not find the cd - it was not released until 1998."
4,Fun but not fantastic,"This was another good game from Humongous, but not their best work. Still, Pajama Sam is an excellent character that we found our children identifying with as they played. The game kept them interested for many hours during the initial run (before solving the game) and then for a few more times as a repeat. But I would recommend the other Pajama Sam games ahead of this one. Also, if this is too easy for your child, try the Spy Fox series; and if it's a little too hard, check out Freddie Fish or even (for the young ones) Putt-Putt the Car. Although these titles are a little bit dated now, they still have excellent playability, kids can identify with the characters and they are VERY inexpensive."
3,Not really happy.,"My 5yr old loved Pajama Sam 1 & 3 so I thought we would try this one. We can only get a little way into the game and we are stuck, not nearly as good as the other 2."
3,Is one of us sleeping?,"I dozed off while reading this and dreamed of sailing. I awakened in that in-between state and I wasn't sure it was Gary dreaming of sailing or the sailor dreaming of Gary? So in this book, who is the real Jan; the swashbuckling adventurer, or the reclusive company head? This reminding me of Gurdjieff's notion that most human beings who are awake act as if they are asleep. The ""Tiger' part of the tales, were particularly well done, but I would have enjoyed more explanation of the conclusion. Mystery and a Jinnie with a bad attitude make for a fun read."
1,not as advertised,"the sellers marked the product as ""very good, like new.""Found the cover to be seriously cracked and the pages waterstained - will not order from them again."
3,"James Bond Collection Vol. 3, VHS","Not a bad collection of Bond material, however, this is a mix of various Bond movies with a variety of leading Bond actors. I recommend looking into the 1996 Collections that have the videos in chronological order and primarily by actor. JAMES BOND 007 Collector's Set, Vol. 1 includes all six Broccoli-produced Sean Connery Bond films, to include a 1995 documentary video. JAMES BOND 007 Collector's Set, Vol 2 includes all seven Roger Moore films and Timothy Dalton's first film. Although these sets are out-of-print, they are still available as used and collector's sets through Amazon.com's Marketplace. If you're like most fans, you'd prefer to have the movies that include your own favorite ""leading-Bond-man""!"
1,Duplication of dvd in a series,"I purchased The James Bond 007 Special Ed DVD CollectionVolume 1 and 2 from Amazon. Regretfully, Live and Let Die, On Her Majesty's Secret Service and Thunderball which were already part of previous collections are included again in Volume 3. I would not recommend buying the Vol 3 if you are collecting the James Bond Series."
3,Durable but shouldn't be 20 dollars or more,"I work at UPS as an unloader and I needed gloves for gripping packages and to protect my hands from splinters, cuts, etc. So picked these up and they worked very well.. for 3 weeks. I thought 20+ dollar gloves would last me longer but at the 3rd week the leather patches on the gloves started pulling apart and I got a huge hole in the palm. I thought id get rid of them but for 20 dollar gloves I decided to use them until they tore off my hands. Now at about a month in a half theres holes in both palms and in a few fingers but they still do the job for now. I like them but i don't think they were worth amount I paid."
4,Good stuff,"Paddy Casey's first CD, Amen: So Be It, was really well done. Mr. Casey (an admirer of the similarly multi-talented Prince) wrote the music, lyrics, and played the instruments. Here, on Living, he is joined by a group of excellent musicians and a very present producer. The result is a strong framework for his new stuff, but one that lacks a singular voice. Also, a few of the songs feature really clumsy lyrics (""Just get in your car / we can go and be a star"") that stick out like bad acting in a high school play.However, the CD as a whole is eminently listenable. The first three tracks are particularly strong--wonderful pop songs with great melodic hooks that linger for days. Casey seems to have left the busker/poet/songwriter thing behind, but Living is a great new statement for him. I'd love to hear him do these live--Paddy Casey: Unplugged. Enjoy!"
4,This cd is pretty good.the songs are better than I expected!,"i was watching the Mtv jams count down the other day and i heard ""are you that somebody"" I started to really like the beat!I really dont like rap alot(exept Will smith)But somehow i loved that song!It said it was from the Dr. dolittle Soundtrack so I went to amazon and bought it!! Theres a little to much rap but it's light so I can deal with it.""Are you that somebody is the best!"
5,love love love this movie,I went to see it in theaters and I was like oh yea getting it on blu ray when it comes out to add to my collection it was cheaper than the store prices too. can't wait for the 5th one although that should be the last IMO
4,Pirates,If you like the first three you'll probably like the fourth one. It's not quite as good but still has a lot of the same antics but with a much more villainous bad guy.
2,Least favorite by far,"What didn't I like about this movie? Where do I begin? Yes, there was plenty of action. But it seemed shallow and lacked the depth of the previous POTC. It wasn't fun and it also seemed absent of the light-heartedness of the the earlier ones. Maybe I missed Orlando Bloom and Kiera Knightly. After it was over...I just thought ""Meh"" and ""Glad that was a Rebox movie and I didn't actually purchase it"" -- I was thoroughly disappointed. But on the other hand, my husband enjoyed it. I didn't particularly like Penelope Cruz in it, either. Anyway, I could ramble on, but the bottom line was, I've always enjoyed the previous three. We own them. I will NOT be purchasing this one."
5,johnny depp is geniuis!!!,"I think PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN ON STRANGER TIDES is the BEST! POTC movie next to the 1st one PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN THE CURSE OF THE BLACK PEARL! JOHNNY DEPP! did a AWESOME JOB! again as CAPTAIN JACK SPARROW & PEONELOPE CRUZ did a GREAT JOB!as (JOHNNY DEPP) CAPTAIN JACK SPARROW""S love intreast as ANGELICA! I MEAN YES IT IS A LITTLE LONG BUT TOTALLY WORTH IT!! THE ONLY THING I WOULD CHANGE IS THE REALESE DATE!! CAUSE I CAN'T WAIT!!!!"
2,The Worst Pirates,"Here is a rule of thumb. Each Pirate movie is exponentially worse than the one previous. The first being a classic, the second being highly entertaining, but not quite as special as the first. The 3rd was a bloated mess. The 4th was worse yet with a pointless plot and phoned in performances by most of the acting core. I fear for the 5th, and based on my infallible observations, it will be less than garbage.Do not buy this unless you are a DEVOTED fan of the Pirates franchise."
2,Beware - disappointing,"All - I absolutely enjoyed the first movie in the serious - almost groundbreaking in it's storytelling and character development. This is the 4th (and hopefully final) movie in the serious and I found it to be very dull. I love the history of Blackbeard, but the way he is portrayed here in this movie is almost comical, which is completely not what he was in real life. Penelope Cruz does as good or better job in the leader female character role and shines, but the rest of the movie is very lackluster. Save your money and re-rent the first - you have been warned."
4,More Pirates!,"While the movie itself is in the same style as the other 3 before it, it fails to capture the same luster. Only Barbosa, Sparrow, Gibbs, and Teague return in this film. The others that made the cast to well rounded decided to move on. It's still a pretty good movie, but not nearly as exciting. The boxset is not bad, but Disney's failure to include Digital Copies with this Blu-Ray\DVD versions is so strange especially since everyone else does for the same price."
3,Enjoyable but not great,"It IS fun to watch Johnny Depp do Captain Jack, and to me it never gets old. However, this particualr outing was not the best in the series. Maybe it missed having some of the other characters in the mix, or maybe they are just running out of steam. Either way it is an obvious cash machine. If you have time to burn it is visually stunning, but most movies are nowadays. Nothing special here."
5,WOW!!,"Not what I expected, way more than I expected! It's one freaky funny and awesome movie! I would watch it over again and again till my husband hides it from me haha!"
2,Below Average,"Well, as it usually happens with continuation of the original brands, specially in Hollywood, the follow up parts tend to be worse than originals.I am a huge fan of the 1st movie, and the 2nd/3rd while not as dynamic as the 1st, was still good watch. The 4th movie however is just a mess of running around, rampage, things falling, out of place ""humor"", etc etc etc. There were a ton of characters and ""sides"" that participated in this so called ""adventure"" yet essentially resulted in nothing. The main villain, the Black Beard was far less fearsome and impressive than main villains from the previous movies. Barbosa was plain out of place, and Jack Sparrow was running around trying to fit in every scene, and drop few lines, before running off to next.Overall I was bored and disappointed. =("
3,Pirates of the Caribbean On Stranger Tides,"I thought it was pretty good, had stuff in the movie different from the others, like the mermaids. I enjoyed it. I know it got a lot of low reviews but I thought it was worth watching."
2,4th POTC,the story was redundant and long. I was yawning thru most of the movie. disney should stop this series b4 they end up making 6 more or something.
2,Buy the normal version.,"Don't buy this and if you do, insist on a tracking number. Three weeks have passed and I still don't have mine.The cost is soooo absurd too."
2,Confusing and Drawn Out,"This is 2 hours I will never get back of my life. The only people coming out ahead are the people involved in this movie since it made a major profit. I personally think they should have stopped at the third installment. This movie is NOT good at all. It's confusing, generic and VERY long. Thank goodness I rented this and did not buy it. I gave it a 2/5 because the mermaids were neat, but that's about the only thing that was neat. I don't even think kids would have the patience to watch all the talking in the film, let alone understand it. Thank goodness this is the last one. You have been warned."
1,I only watched this once. Bad movie. Story line is awful.,I watched this only once. That is a bad sign. There is no plot that I can tell. I should say it has less of a plot then the second and third movies.If you are going to buy or rent this movie then lower your expectations down to one star or less then you won't be too disappointed.So much talent in Johnny Depp. To bad he is forced to act with a poor script.
1,Whats with the release date>,"Ads on TV have this DVD being released yesterday, 10-18-11Why is Amazon not selling till November?I find this to be a bit odd."
1,ASPECT RATIO,"Seriously? 1.85:1 aspect ratio??!!! The earlier three movies in the ""Pirates"" series were 2.35:1. I am hoping that this is just an error in Amazon's product listing. If ""Stranger Tides"" is indeed in 1.85:1 aspect ratio I am not interested. Amazon: If it is 2.35:1 please correct your product listing. I will rent it first. If it is in 2.35:1 I will purchase the Blu Ray, if it is in 1.85:1, forget it."
3,not worthy of the series....,This movie pales in comparison to the first. It is not as good as the second or third either. It is bad enough that I actually had to stop watching it and take a break. It just seems cheesy to the point of being stupid. There are a few scenes that make it watchable though. The mermaid scene is really cool and reminds me of the quality of the first movie alot. Other than that it looks like this series has run its course.
2,"Too Long, Too Boring",I enjoyed the first of this set of movies but this was a real yawn from beginning to end. Jack Sparrow was even more one dimensional and the overall story just did not work. Not a good time.
3,Disappointed,"I have the first three pirate movies. Unfortunately this new release just doesn't stand up to the story line or the distinct quality of the first three. It is missing some memorable characters as well. Some folk's like this movie and rate it high, but we each have different thoughts and reasons behind our ratings. It was of course well done as movies go, but as for myself (an award winning author), I could have given them a much better story line sequal. I would not have bought it if I had seen it previously, but it does serve to complete the collection. Regretably, MST"
2,"No real plot, but it was only $1.99","This is by far the least entertaining of the the Pirates movies. It seems like there are too many pirate sword fighting scenes, which do not progress the plotline. Depp is still great as Jack Sparrow, but it looks like the writers have run out of ideas."
3,Meh...,The only reason this movie is even getting three stars from me is because I bought it as a digital download. It gets one star because I didn't pay theatre prices for it.
2,Disapointed,"I had missed this movie when it first came out. While it has Johny Dep in it, who I love as Captain Jack Sparrow, this movie was so so.I have loved all the Pirate movies, but this one was a cash grab using the Pirate name. It was nothing like the other movies, and it lacked the gusto the others had.Sadly speaking it just did not live up to my expectations. Stranger Tides yes I would say strange, but Pirate's it was not. Lack of a good plot and just thrown together action scenes just made this movie boring."
3,Pirates 4 was okay but,Pirates 4 was okay and it is always nice to see Depp as Jack Sparrow. My problem is with the variety of versions to purchase. Why no digital copy with the Blue-ray/DVD? Is it a way to make people who have no 3D buy the movie in 3D? Or just buy the package with the 3D? I didn't see the movie in 3D in the theater. Unless it is a special movie I find 3D distracting and painful. Seems just another way to eek more bucks out of people who like extras. Liked the chart though. I don't have to guess about what is included.
2,A warrior forgetting to bring his spear,"And that spear is wma format music. Everything else was good, up to the snuff, but once I found out Sony's products do not accept wma format, I decided to ""dump the baby"". What a stupid, or arrogant company Sony is! Everybody else can claim how good it is, (since they own it, they hate to hear bad things about it). I am honest, as wma becomes more popular and has a better sound quality, I cannot forgive Sony for its stupidity: I finally bought a different much nicer product..."
1,This cd seriously ...,"Alright, peep this~! ;xThis cd is not worth picking up, you might as well just download the only good songs which are ""this could be love"", ""solo star"", ""sky away"" and ""crush"" which is my personal favorite, the rest [arent great], the lyrics and the beats need serious help, and if it wasn't for her sister Beyonce, she wouldn't have a career in this industry. If I owned this cd, I would send it back to the record company. It's pretty bad when you have 22 songs on a cd and only 4 are worth listening to. For real, if you people like this cd you have some serious problems that are way deeper than you can imagine.I think I'm done . . ."
2,where are the funny parts?,"After seeing the 5 star reviews by other viewers here, I was prepared to laugh like never before. Boy, was I disapointed!!! Maybe this movie would have been funny if I was 10 years younger but this kind of comedy I've already seen a million times (i.e.,Air Plane, Naked Gun). I suggest saving your money and time by watching something more entertaining."
1,A Demoralizing Movie,"I can't believe how popular this movie is. It is the most numbing, obscence piece of trash I have ever had the unfortunate priviledge of watching.I have a great sense of humor, but the ""humor"" portrayed in this movie is just bathroom humor, down-in-the-gutter humor. There is not an honest joke throughout this entire mess.I watched it, and I only laughed once; even that was a mere chuckle. If you found this an exhilirating movie . . . GET A LIFE!"
4,Lots of Good Targets to Make Sport of,"Myers has chosen quite a few areas ripe for jokes. If you don't mind silly, you will probably laugh at this and it will become funnier when you talk about it with others that have seen this flick."
3,To innapropite!,"I watched this movie, well the begining with my friend Lesley and I was so disgusted with all the nonsense and sexual stuff in the movie. I was praying for her mother to come and take her and luckily she did. It was also disgusting. I am truely disappointed in Mike Myers. It's not a movie for kids. I do like Mike in other movies too, though. I like Shrek and the 2nd and I only saw some of so I married an axe murderer. I also liked Wayne`s world sort of the 2nd is okay. This movie is not for children!"
4,Hilarious!!,"I thought this was one of the funniest movies I've ever seen!! When I first saw it, I laughed so much I hurt!! The toilet scene with Tom Arnold was especially funny, and I broke into tears I cried so hard. Dr. Evil is one of the movies best parts, and I really wish this movie had more of him. His character is used more in the second movie, but unfortunately it isn't nearly as good as the first one."
2,An original movie but lacking in many areas,"I am a fan of Mike Myers and I thought Wayne's World and So I Married an Axe Murderer were both great movies. However I think that Austin Powers was not really ""laugh out loud"" funny and not really entertaining due to somewhat vulgar humor. There are other movies out there if you are looking for a comedy."
4,"It's Very Shagedelic, Baby!","Mike Myers has done his best work since Wayne's World. The funny SNL guy turns into Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery. Austin Powers has to save the world by stopping Dr. Evil, Austin's enemy. Dr. Evil, who is also played by Mike Myers, has an underground drill that will ruin the world!"
1,"Are you stupid, Baby?","Anybody who seriously likes this movie is insane, unethical, and has no morals. The movie was only funny because of how stupid it was and the plot was absolutely horrible. I gave it one star because the only good part were those that were in parody against other stupid pieces of work... Still, why make a stupid movie that makes fun of other stupid movies? This movie's rediculous-- Don't watch it."
4,Shagidelically funny!,"Austin powers international man of mystery is a hilarious movie! Lots of gross humor and slapstick comedy. Appropriately rated PG-13, this film will have you rolling of your seat whether it's Dr.Evil's cat Mr.Biggle'sworth or Austin power's libido!"
4,Groovy Baby!,"This is one of my favorite movies ever! I first saw it a few years ago, and loved it. However, within the last year, I've watched all 19 Bond movies, and now many more jokes in Austin Powers make sense. I now understand what was with the chairs dumping people into fire (similar to the electric chairs in Thunderball), Random Task's shoe throwing (Oddjob with his hat in Goldfinger), and where some of the villan's names came from (Random Task = Oddjob, Alotta Fagina = Pussy Galore, No. 2 = No. 2/Emilio Largo). I don't know about other people, but I also like this movie better than the sequel. The sequel isn't as funny or original, too much bathroom humor. The original Austin Powers is in my opinion one of the funniest movies I've seen."
4,Myers is a comedic genius.,I thought this movie was awesome. It was so funny. Mike Myers is such a great comedian when it comes to delivery and timing. I saw the sequel a couple of days ago and i have to say it was alot funnier. Mini-mi rules. I can't wait for the third Powers movie to come out.
2,Terrible Transfer,"I LOVE this movie, but I am reviewing the DVD, not the movie. The DVD transfer for this movie is atrocious. The aspect ratio is wrong. There are grainy scenes and scenes where the film was obviously dirty. Need a new transfer from the master laser disks."
2,Emperor's New Clothes,"Unfortunately, I did not see this until after two years of hype had gone on. Predictably, it did not live up to that hype. I like Mike Myers, and Austin is a great character for him, but the movie simply did not exploit either his talent or the Austin character.It had funny moments, but too few to hold the movie together. Hope they get better writers for future episodes."
5,this movie is good and the 2nd one should be better,this movie is funny and the 2nd austin powers should be better than this one
1,UTTERLY REPULSIVE,"This film is desperately unfunny, and derives nearly all of its ""humor"" from the bathrooom. Mike Meyers is a physically repulsive performer (both in and out of his Austin Powers role), and how he mangages to command a following is unfathomable to me."
1,I MUST BE GETTING OLD OR ARE OTHER PEOPLE REALLY THAT STUPID,"i'm 37 years old and watched this movie with 5 other people ranging in age from 27 to 75. you know when you watch a movie with others, you figure they may be enjoying it so you hang around the living room to be polite? at the end of this movie, we all must have had the same thoughts...we looked at each other and said ""did you enjoy this"", ""no, i thought you enjoyed it"", ""no, i didn't like it"", ""no me neither"". i wish someone would have spoke up so i could have saved 2 hours of my life. i guess the qualifications for watching this video is STUPIDITY. it's not funny, not even 3 stooges slapstick funny, it is just dumb! perhaps if you wear the ""in-style"" pants with your boxer shorts exposed you probably understand this movie and maybe can explain why you wear the pants that low if all day you are pulling them up...DUMB LIKE THE MOVIE!"
1,It taught them very little!,"My twin grandaughters, aged just 4, were bored. First, there was a 4+ minute intro of text and fiction (of 30- minutes total). The child was made up like a mannequin. At the dance studio, the teacher demonstrated some moves no beginner could do and showed no background demonstration or correction of the (adorable to a Nana) mis-steps of the tiny students, also wearing, not the usual practice outfits, but fancy costumes and much makeup. The exercise section was too short and only so-so, and the final ""talent show"" songs by each of the students was adorable, but a waste of the time of all but the children's parents and friends. All in all, a waste of time for anyone who wants to learn the proper technique to begin with, or even move along with the screen students."
5,EXCELENTE CD,"SOLO PUEDO DECIR QUE ME LLEGÓ EN EXCELENTE ESTADO Y EL CD ES MAGNIFICO, SOBRETODO CON LOS EXTRA TRACKS, MUY BUENA COMPRA!!!!"
4,"Great, it ROCKS!","Look, the majority of reviews go on and on about the re-recorded bass and drums. Yes it was wrong for the record company to not state that the album has been re-recorded in parts but as a recent Ozzy convert I haven't even heard the album in its earlier form so I can only comment on the new edition and it rocks. I don't have a problem with the drums or bass though at the same time I can't understand why they had to re-record the bass and drum tracks anyway. They surely knew it would upset Ozzy's legion of longtime fans..."
1,Yes it really is as bad as they say!,"The Re-Recorded Bass and Drums sound HORRIBLE, yeah some people might like A ""Fresh flavor of the month twist"" but personally I don't. This CD Was the worst purchase I made in my entire life, and I've bought Hundreds upon hundreds of Albums.What a shame that Lee Kerslake and Bob Daisley the original musicians must take Ozzy to court to earn royalties for what they played on."
1,ewwwwwwwwww!,"Spare me from this nightmare. How could Ozzy orSharon or the record company or whoever think this could possibly be a good idea? It's like finding Metallica's ""Kill 'Em All"" drumtracks on the ""Reload"" album, that wouldn't work, well, neither does this. This has to be the worst scam in the history of record making. These Ozzy albums were remastered just a few years ago, I bought them a second time then, now I gotta go out and spend my wad a third time to find this crap on 'em! What is the point here? You got my money, that's the point. I am livid over this little fiasco! 2002 drums and bass on a 1980 recording, this makes a lot of sense, yes sirrie! Ozzy has truly fried his brain."
5,Ozzy is the King!,This is the first album I have bought of Ozzy's solo career. I have to admit I absolutly love this CD. I especially look foward to the great Randy Rhodes guitar riffs and solos in every song. Pitty he only lived for 2 albums. Songs 7 and 9 are probally the only real week songs on the CD. I also recommend the great album Diary of the Madman.
1,Should be illegal,Do not buy this CD! It is not the original! It has been re-recorded! This is a terrible offense to all Ozzy fans and music fans in general. Reissuing albums like this should not be allowed and should not be tolerated. Demand that the original albums be put back in print!
1,Blizzard of Ozz,"I was at Hara Arena in Dayton Ohio on May 9 1981 and saw The Blizzard of Ozz Tour. The opening act that night, MotorHead. One of the best Metal Shows I've ever seen. I was a big Ozzy fan. Now, not so much. They have destroyed a Rock n Roll Master piece. Greed is an ugly monster. One star is one to many."
1,Fixing something not broken,"Blizzard of Ozz is one of the best heavy metal albums of all time, this isn't that album. The re-recording of the rhythm tracks and remix of this record ruins what was perfectly fine in the first place. Besides the duff modern sounding drums, which do not gell with the tracks from the original session, the guitar tones have somewhat different effects taking away from Randy Rhoads classic and unique tone. It wouldn't have been such a bad thing, if they would have had the remix/masters along with the original mix, like I have seen on some Deep Purple and Grand Funk Railroad reissues. As it is now, this is a piece of junk. Skip this one and look for the earlier masters."
1,Abominable,"It's been said before, it will be said again: DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME listening to this re-recorded trash. The original is, in my opinion, a work of the greatest brilliance, full of energy and spirit and perhaps one of the greatest rock albums of all time.Too bad it's been discontinued and replaced by this garbage. The re-recorded bass and drums sound awful, thick, ridiculous. Blizzard and Diary of a Madman have been ruined, and all that is left of their memory is the 1995 remaster. Hope somebody gets the clue and brings it back. This is no longer music. Removing Daisley and Kerslake from the CD is an offence to the fans, the art, and the ears. It's kind of like if Black Sabbath went back and changed all of Ozzy's vocals for Ronnie James Dio's. Why?!?!?Ozzy, your music was the best. Please give it back."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS!!!!!!!!!!!!,"... We should be told if parts are rerecorded or if we're not getting the original album remastered. Do not buy DIARY either,it is the same [situation]. I was fooled,so the best I can do is tell you not to buy this garbage. It's like painting a mustache on the Mona Lisa! Rating: Negative 1 Star!"
3,"Not as good as the original, but still worth buying","I bought this a while ago because I had heard of Randy Rhoads (RIP). The reissue blew my mind. I thought how could someone be this good at guitar. Than I heard about Ozzy putting a new rhythm section on the album. I found a 1995 reissue of Blizzard of Ozz for 7.00$. The bass isn't as modern sounding and the drummer sounds like a real drummer and less like a studio musician. My advice, try to find the originals. They are that much better. Also I think they might have tweaked Randy's guitar tone. It sounds better for some reason on my original copy. Hunt it down, worth it and they are getting rarer. ALSO, Randy Rhoads tribute (5 star), Diary of a Madman. And there is a Quiet Riot album called the Randy Rhoads years (he put out some records with them before he was with Ozzy that only got released in Japan). If you don't want to hunt down an album buy Randy Rhoads tribute it's incredible. This is still worth buying though."
1,Do NOT get fooled by this!,"As I wrote in the Diary of a Madman review, I love Ozzy. DOAM is my favorite, but this one ( the original ) is a very close second. However, I think Ozzy literally DESTROYED two masterpieces by re-recording them. If you are familiar with Bob Daisley bass playing you know it's NOT TRUE that the bass sound was improved. Even if it was, that is not the most decent thing to do to a musician who put his heart and soul into a project. That superfine bass playing is gone forever. Watching ""The Osbournes"" I am almost sure that this abomination has a ""Sharon finger"" on it. 5 star to the original, minus 100000 to this."
1,Disgraceful,"Straight to the point: Ozzy and Sharon are spineless cowards. Even if you assume the worst and it were true that Daisley and Kerslake were just trying to smooch unfair royalties (which I sincerely doubt), you don't defile two of metal's alltime masterpieces by re-recording them with other musicians. I can only assume that the Black Prince of Obedience and his Overlord Wench were worried about the outcome in court, and hence the ""re-master"" of the recordings. Buy the original recordings second hand, so they get no further royalties. Then go buy the Living Loud CD with Daisley and Kerslake playing their own Ozzy ""covers"" with Steve Morse on guitar so they can get some roylalties. Steve Morse is a nice guy, and I don't think he would associate himslef with a pair of smoochers, if you know what I mean?"
1,Punked,"First of all, I had both vinyls (Blizzard of Ozz, Diary of a Madman) in the eighties, but sadly I sold, trade and/or lost them.Tired of having sucky bad-compressed mp3s in my PC, I decided to order both by Amazon. Let's have both CDs! I saw that these were the 95 reissues (with Lee Kerslake & Bob Daisley in the rhythm section). It says here: ""original CD reissues from 1995"". Good deal because you can't find them anywhere.But - alas! - I received those goddamned 2002 versions with Sharon & Kelly on bass and drums!Like we say in my good ol'town: Punked!"
4,GET THIS ONE IF YOU CAN FIND IT,"Get this one if you can find it. Do NOT, repeat, do NOT, get the ""remastered version with additional tracks! It is one of the biggest ripoffs since George Harrison did his bit with ""My Sweet Lord"" - Ozzy (Sharon?) wiped Bob Daisley and Lee Kerslake from that ""remaster"". And the worst part is you don't know it until you buy it and get it home and notice how different it sounds. I found this used and it still sounds like 1981...and that's no bad thing as far as I'm concerned, digital age or not!My usual one-star knockoff for Ozzy not being much of a singer. He's an entertainer, this is most certainly true, but no singer."
5,Let the madness begin!!!,"Been listening to this cd for over 10 years; haven't had a suicidal thought yet! To the contrary, this album is not about death, it's about living. This was Ozzy's first solo CD and possibly his best. He gives us such inspirational lyrics as ""maybe it's not to late- to learn how to love and forget how to hate."" This is the true classic that has become an indispensable item for fans around the world."
1,More people need to know about this.,"I can think of very few acts more despicable than this in the annals of rock music. I hate Ozzy and his wife. This outrage needs to be more widely known. Sickening. Needless to say, don't buy this reissue with rerecorded drums and bass. The Osbournes' greed knows no limits."
1,Sacrilege,"1 : a technical and necessarily intrinsically outrageous violation (as improper reception of a sacrament) of what is sacred because consecrated to God2 : gross irreverence toward a hallowed person, place, or thing"
2,I can't use Biotin Tablets,"I took these tablits for about 15 days and I got an itchy rash and became constipated. They may work well for others but I'll never know since I had to stop taking them. When I stopped, everything cleared up."
5,"So far, so good","Any pills of this nature require patience as you have to wait for the new growth from your nailbed. At my dermatologists's recommendation, I started taking it for better hair health and observed new hair growth within a few weeks. After a few months, I can see an increase in my nail strength. I have always had very weak and flexible nails. They do not bend and split at the sides at the tip of my fingers like they have done all my life. Again, you have to be patient where nails are concerned. It takes a long time for new nail growth to reach the tips of your fingers all the way from the nail bed."
4,Great Product,I have only been taking this for about three weeks now. My nails were pretty weak and I could almost bend a couple of them. I have noticed a good improvemenet already in my nails so I can't wait to see after a couple of months. I would definitely recommend anyone with weak nails to give it a try. Also my mother in laws hairdresser recommened it for a thicker texture of her clients hair....
4,Works as promised,I've been using Appearex for several months and noticed a difference in my brittle nails after a few weeks. MUCH more ecconomical purchasing here in 84 tablet boxes.
5,Better Nails,"I bought this product after seeing it advertised in a woman's magazine. My fingernails had become weak and brittle. After taking Appearex for a few months not only did my nails become stronger and grow faster, my skin was less dry and my hairdresser noticed that my hair was thicker. I have been taking it for several years. No bad effects, only good ones!"
3,"Promising, but too soon to tell","I have seen minor improvement with the use of this product, but to be fair, it has only been one month and I suspect that it may take longer to gain benefits. I was pleased with the price, my doctor charged $30 for a 30 day supply."
5,"""SHE"" won't fade away","The quality of songs in this album is tremendouslyhigh, I must say. Included the new version of""BLACK ON BLACK"" from the movie ""9 1/2 WEEKS.""This is one of albums you can listen to again andagain and AGAIN."
5,"Inspirational, comprehensive - must have on your shelf","Brilliant. There's a 100-page intro, followed by short selections from every major Zionist thinker. Each selection is preceded by a 2-page synopsis of the thinker.Although compiled decades ago, the writings are timeless and the commentary feels fresh. This edition is from 1997, so maybe they did some edits to keep it fresh.This material is just begging to be read by anyone with even the vaguest interest in Israel. History repeats itself, and by reading this, it becomes clear that the struggle for the basic Jewish right to self-determination continues to this very day. The need for a Jewish homeland and the conflict in 2011 have both been ongoing since the inception of modern Zionism. Read for yourself.Make this available on the Kindle!"
1,Title is VERY Misleading,"I am very disappointed in this book ....... I cannot imagine how this book would help a truly phobic flyer. It is mostly about how emergency situations are handled, and how an informed passenger should behave during an emergency, like landing on water or fire on-board the plane. Duane Brown's book is truly for the fearful flyer, and there are a few others, but this is NOT one of them."
5,Slammin',Y'all should check this one out. This is Will Smith's best effort no fillers. Funky laid back production and dope rhymes.
4,WORTH THEMONEY,"DID A LOT OF SHOPPING AROUND AND COMPARISON BETWEEN PC CAPABLES ""FLAT TV'S"" AND TV CAPABLE ""FLAT MONITORS"" AND FOUND SCEPTRE TO BE A GOOD VALUE WHEN COMPARED TO HGHER PRICED UNITS.PROS: 16:9 ASPECT RATIO, LIGHT WEIGHT, REMOTE, PLENTY OF INPUTS.CONS: 1 YEAR WARRANTY, FLASHY-PLASTIC EXTERIOR, NO AUDIO OUTPUT,NO HDTV OR 1080i CAPABILITY."
5,Had to buy it!,"I picked this book up at the local library while I was looking for my first plane. After using up all my renewals and continually referring to it, I had to buy. It goes into much more detail than other books about what to expect during and after purchase."
1,Lacks imagination and poorly written,"After seeing all the rave reviews, we decided to buy these fairy books for our girls. I hoped it would be worth it, but boy was I wrong. My [...] daughters kept asking me what was happening in the story because the author simply couldn't write to save his life. The [...] kept pleading with me to stop and the [...] secretly threw the first book away so we wouldn't have to read any more. The story lacks imagination and talks down to readers, in short it is a complete waste of time. I tried to get our money back."
1,"Worked good for a while, then fizzled out.","This worked okay for about 6 months, then when my zune wouldn't charge in the car anymore, I thought the problem was with the zune. I hooked the zune up to my computer and realized it wasn't the zune, it was the car charger. Then, I found if I wiggled it and held it ""just so"" in the cigarette lighter, it might work, until I hit a bump in the road. And it wasn't the cigarette lighter, because other devices worked just fine. So would I recommend this product - uh, NO."
3,Good charger,Charge the Zune in the car without problem. However it would have been better if the cable came out at the end rather than the side for the cigarette adapter.
2,Fuse is internal!,"I have a stupid waterproof 12volt plug that has 1 white and 1 grey wire. Well, the thing got hooked up backwards and then the Zune charger was plugged into it . . . without the Zune attached. It seems to have blown the fuse, which is usually a screw off tip on the unit. Not this $30 unit. I can't replace the fuse so it's going to get returned, after I buy a new one. LOL Ohhhhh, BTW the white wire is - and the grey wire is +. Good thing my FM transmitter has a replaceable fuse.Other than the fuse being internal, this is a very nice charger. But, useless without a fuse."
3,bedtime stories...,Wow! Adam Sandler doesn't have to be crude! This is a cute family movie with hardly any stupid stuff.
1,Bedtime Stories,I think the product sent was technically defective. I could not watch it!!! It could not be opened.I would like to get a replacement or credit.
5,"Yes, parents, it is SAFE","Yes, it is safe to take the kids to this one! The whole family enjoyed it. We had left the 14 year old at home, but will rent it as soon as it comes out so she can see it too. The message is positive, the innuendos few, and the theme is just plain fun. Even the ""Paris"" character keeps things mostly covered. Nice change for a 21st Century film.The lead, though he starts out trying to manipulate life to go his materialistic ways, learns how to manipulate life to benefit all of those around him. He is just that kind of guy who never could have been the selfish fool. So, it really can be a great discussion starter for the family about morality, unselfishness, and proper behavior in community.On top of all that deep stuff, it is just hilariously funny! There were even some applause at the end when we watched it in the theater. It has been a long time since I've been in a movie where the audience was moved to applause."
2,Not up to standard,"One can be a passionate fan of Dan and still not embrace this particular work. On this one, the upbeat, carefree style which is so effectively conveyed in songs like Cowboy's Dream No. 19 and You Got To Believe sounds forced. The songs about Boogaloo Jones and Vinnie might fit the corresponding characters in Bakshi's cartoon, but that's not good. True to the Bakshi method, the portrayals are just blah stereotypes of street-wise hipsters. That is a major disappointment given how Hicks is otherwise so consistent in bringing his uniquely skewed sensibility to everything he touches. And last of all, the customary ensemble precision ain't there. The music sounds under-rehearsed. Mary Ann is flat on practically everything she sings. If you are a completest who must have every recording from this edition of the band, you'll of course want IHON. All others should look elsewhere."
3,Just as advertised,"Bought this DVD for my husband for father's day and it has turned out to be a mixed blessing. He loves it and watches DVDs till all hours. The unit works perfectly, the screen excellent for his over 75 eyes, and we are well satisfied!"
1,Seachoice Rod Holder,These rod holders are awful. I bought four of them and within the first week of having them three of the four broke. they are made very cheap and i will never buy them again. i do not recomend this product for anyone.
3,Sell Out City,"It's obvious that this album was only released to cash in on the success of THE OSBOURNES. Aside from stealing the title of the Cheap Trick classic the album is missing many excellent cuts, PARANOID is the only Sabbath song to make the disc and songs like SUICIDE SOLUTION, LIGHTNING STRIKES and OVER THE MOUNTAIN aren't even included, it centres more on the DOWN TO EARTH cd, which in my opinion is far from being Ozzy's best album. Zakk Wylde's hellacious fretwork is the only reason to buy BUDOKAN. Let's hope the next Sabbath album from the classic lineup does come out eventually. LIVE AT BUDOKAN is basically just a license for gullible kids turned on to Ozzy by TV to buy it now that it's cool to like him. Personally I preferred it back in the days when if you admitted to liking Sabbath or Ozzy people thought you were a satan worshipping freak."
5,Jeremy ROCKS,"Jeremy Northam has demonstrated that not only can he carry a picture, he will often be the best thing about it, as evidenced by this film. His acting is flawless and riveting, turning what could've been a masterpiece theatre weepie into a facinating story based on the true life saga of Peter Warlock. The young woman is replaceable, altho she holds her pluck in some scenes. I don't know how I missed this at my local art house, but am glad to own it and if you're a Northam fan, will be glad you do, too. He is turning into the Olivier of our time, performance after performance. Now if only he and Julienne Moore would get together:> - m."
5,Tina Turner - Break Every Rule,This is a fantastic CDIt is not seen very often which is a travesty.It took me a while to find a supplier and thenit took a while to be delivered.Great songs by a great artist.Worth the wait.
5,great product,This was a great product. After we put it in we noticed the mpg was a lot better on out truck.
3,Not just for chevy,"This one is Ok. It is known most for its title cut, and non of the other songs made it to the greatest hits album. But its still a decent album. I have always enjoyed bob's voice. The silver bullet band has always been great also."
4,Adjustment needed to fit firearm,It appears that this holster is made for several firearms.I had to adjust it several times for the release to be sufficiently easyto withdraw the F N H.
1,garbage,I don't think the replacements needed the songs to be covered this way. They are plenty raw and crude enough on the their own.
5,"Remembering Walt is an uplifting, insightful must read","Amy and Howard Green's book ""Remembering Walt"" is as inspiring as ever. Can any name other than Walt Disney conjure up memories that are solidified in all things good and decent and red, white, and blue American? This was not by accident, and this book is a must read to understand the genius of the man who continues to keep us forever young. An all-encompassing dream maker who endured, dispite the odds and naysayers. An inspiration for all Americans seeking successful role models."
2,This great lake deserved a great book,"Unfortunately, this is not it. One would figure that both the creation of Candlewood Lake, a project unsurpassed in its day--and its resulting splendor--would have resulted in a book packed with information and antidotal passages. What you will find is a book filled with black and white photographs, each with a brief caption underneath. At minimum, even these would have been enhanced if there had been a thumbnail of the map beside each caption which showed where these shots were taken. Strangely enough, however, the two maps of Candlewood (one prior to the lake's creation and the other a map of the lake today) are printed sideways (where west is at the top of the map) without any indication of where north is."
4,"Great CD, a little slow, though","This is an awesome CD, but there are waaaay too many slow songs on it. The only song that's a little more active is ""True to Your Heart"", and we've all heard that. But all the songs have good melodies and great lyrics. You guys still rock, though!"
4,Happy Shipped Fast,Cd came after 2 days of ordering it only problem is the case is cracked and they didn't state it was cracked other than that the cd is fine and sealed
5,I love their music!!!!!!!!!,"Okay, so I'm not really the boy band type. I usually stick to rap and stuff. But I have to admit 98 degrees can sing. And they are a little cute especially Nick! I hope that someday people other than their fans will understand that they are not a ""boy band""! But real cute singing guys!"
5,I Love 98 Degrees,98 Degrees have awesome songs and are all very hot!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5,ON FIRE!!!,"This is surely the hottest cd out there, heh, just look at the name. Not only are the guys hot but so is there music. Surely the best cd I have and the best song on the lp is ""The Hardest Thing."" That song just makes me cry!"
1,WHEN WILL THE BOY BAND MADNESS END?,"iTS FUNNY you girs who say I love you jeff or i love you justin timberlake. This band was started to gain mass profit and fame, not to express passion through music and give their hearts out. The shame of being actually in one of these bands is quickly overridden by the mass amounts of beautiful women(I cant blame em, as much as they do suck)They are money hungry and fame hungry,not caring like you think they are. They are probably very simple minded and boring, even though they are ""hot"". dont believe their lie. the only positive thing is that there are 4 guys instead of five, which shows some amount of individuality(not)"
5,More than pop!,"This album is a soul-filled look into the boy band scene. The exquisite harmonies and beautiful lyrics make this album hard to hate. Sure, the intro is corny and ""She's Out of My Life"" isn't original, but the blend of the group makes this album worth the while. I promise you that this cd is worth the money and time. :)"
1,A Simple Review,"I'm not going to waste a lot of time reviewing this crummy CD. 98 Degrees is the worst group EVER! They are the only group I ever have given 1 star, and the completely deserve it. They are so boring and sound like a bunch of girls on this CD. Their only bearable song ever was ""Give Me One Night (Una Noche)"" if you like it, though, DON'T buy this. It's not like anything on here."
1,Whats alll the hype?,"I really do not see what people see in this. They are no different the the backstreet boys, and n'sync. You can find a son about love any day, any time. Trust me, this is nothing even remotely close to special, or original. This is just another band that got caught up in the trend of ""boy bands"" or whatever you guys call it. 98 degrees will just be forgotten like any other band that sold out."
4,Rockin' Sound,"CD is not your typical boy-band CD....probably cause these guys don't really fit into the boyband formula. They have a different sound on a few songs from what you might find with BSB or NSYNC. Great tracks include an arrangement with Stevie Wonder (#10 ""True to your Heart"") and an acapella arrangement of ""She's Out of My Life"" (#13)."
4,Bianaca love you long time,I'd bought these towels cheaper in the past but for any amount of money they're the best!
4,"Solid First Effort, prose could be better","Don Corace has put together a decent book. The story line is strong, the character development is good, all together ""Offshore"" is an engaging read which teaches the laymen amongst us a thing or two about the offshore drilling industry. Though (by the writer's own admission) with not a lot of detail. The writer explains rather complex subject matter in very simplistic ways, it makes for a much easier read.Even though Offshore has a strong plot, the story is sometimes hurt by Mr. Corace's plodding prose. The book sort of reminds me of John Grisham's ""The Firm"", stellar plot, but the writer never completely wraps you up in the story. Perhaps a ghost writer would serve Mr. Corace well, he has a good mind for a story, but he may not be the best one to tell it.All and all a worthwhile read."
2,only 2 save the collection,"The only DVDs worth your money from this collection are Zig Ziglar's with an absolute 5 star and Tom Hopkins with a 4 star. The rest are really lame. Specially, the worst of all is the improvised speech by Qubein recommending to get the most expensive haircut in town to make you look as good as him and the story on how he purchased his two Mercedes Benz at the same time (where is the sales story here?). In the other two DVDs, half of the time the speakers waste time telling you personal family experiences that have nothing to do with sales at all. Including a 20 minute long recollection of how one of them survived an accident while flying his plane. Most DVDs are about one hour long."
2,dated,These songs don't pass the test of time. Basic and forgettable. Guess he needs the money. Always was overrated to begin with.
3,might wanna look for another live album,"Nine Tonight is a very uninteresting live album. It doesn't feel like Bob Seger went out of his way to make any of the songs exciting. It's more like a feeling of Bob and the rest of the band going through the motions, or a feeling of ""It's time to release a live album, and this is what we're giving you"". I don't believe the band was really feeling the excitement or the energy that made much of these songs sound so good in the studio. If you happen to own these songs on their regular studio albums, you'd be better off avoiding this album altogether and just sticking with what you have. Or better yet, look into some late 60's Bob Seger, which was the absolute high point of his career."
3,Better on tape,"This sounds live, in concert. Can't remember any songs that stand out. Good lead, cymbals on drum, and bass. Better when the tape don't break."
4,Heart of the 70s,"Steve Miller Band goes down easy. I can't say I was ever in love with them, but if you were around then, they were an integral part of the soundtrack. Yeah, so Rock'n Me and Jet Airliner are pretty much the same song. That's part of the charm. I see there's a critique on the crime of editing these songs down, which is certainly valid, but top-40 radio is pretty much how I experienced them, so I don't consider it a big loss."
3,good but flawed!,"Steve Miller Band's Greatest Hits 1974-1978 lives up to it's title for the most part except that ""The Joker"" is from 1973. While the album has Steve Miller's biggest radio hits, there is not much point to the album, other than ""The Joker"" the rest of the songs only come from two different albums,""Fly Like an Eagle and ""Book of Dreams"" and both of those albums are good enough that most fans would be pleased with those to albums. The other thing that counts against this album is the edited version of ""Jet Airliner"". I would recommend getting Fly like an Eagle, Book of Dreams, and the new Greatest Hits Cd that covers his whole career."
5,nostalgic fun for your summer picnic,"Steve Miller is just plain fun. Nothing very deep. A nice voice, but nothing that makes you sigh in ecstasy. He'd be so much fun to have at a barbecue. You just KNOW he'd be the guy spiking the watermelon, winking at the chicks.This CD contains ""The Joker,"" which has one of my favorite lines EVER in any song:""You're the cutest thing that I ever did see""Really love your peaches, want to shake your tree.""That makes it possible to forgive him for lines like this one, from ""Take the Money & Run"":""They headed down to old El Paso""That's where they ran into a great big hassle...""Yeah, well, we all have good days, bad days, and some of us just happen to memorialize those days in music....Crack open a Red Hook, pull out your lawn chair, and give ol' Stevie a listen on a cloudless August afternoon."
1,R-e-m-a-s-t-e-r,"Yes Capitol records,I broke it down so you could better understand what is required. I see this cd in everyones collection but man does this thing need to be improved. I suppose as long as it continues to sell they don't feel the need to improve the quality of the sound."
5,"Fly like an Eagle, let you spirit set you free.","A wonderful CD of some of Mr. Miller's best tunes. This is a staple for those times when you want to kick back and relax, and just fade into your memories. Super tunes."
4,splendid photography,"Barry Brukoff has done a truly fine job of capturing the essence of Machu Picchu. I've told many that you cannot convey the feeling of this place in photos, but Brukoff proves that you can. His photos made me feel as though I was back there, discovering the majesty of the site and indulging in a leisurely and personal exploration of the details that delighted me during my visit, details that those on quick tourist jaunts usually miss. Visually, this book is five stars. Neruda's poetry, however, missed the mark for me. An earlier reviewer picked out the best of it and included those lines in his review (see below). I only wish it all worked that well. Personally, I would have preferred excerpts from Neruda's work and excerpts from the writings of Hiram Bingham (Bingham was the man who discovered the site in 1911)."
5,The best Violin CD Ever,"I have looked for a long time to find a ""classical"" cd that I can listen to while doing homework. Unfortunately, they usually cause me to fall asleep. This cd is upbeat and fresh, and I don't have that problem anymore. I play the violin, and have for almost 6 years, and I wish that I could play even half as good as she sounds on Storm. I recommend this to anyone who is into classical music but needs a little more of an edge."
4,Vanessa rides the storm,This collection of Rock & classical music by the best violinist around only fails in so much that she doesn't write nearly enough of her own material and relies a bit on music already known by the people who listen to this album.(especially the older ones like me.However it does show her to have an amazing insight to the kind of album that her fans want to hear because there are so many different styles on it.Havin g seen her live 5 times already I can only say that she should really win more awards for her music because unlike other so called stars she really can play both live and on disc.Surely on the strength of this she has a sparkling career ahead of her.And she can only get better.!
3,Worth a Listen but Not the Wait,"Vanessa Mae's long awaited ""new"" CD ""Storm"" (its been available in Europe since November of last year) is a compilation of different styles and interpretations of various musical forms. Overall, the CD is enjoyable but so much of the material has appeared on other albums that the listener might wonder if this was put out to fulfill a contractual obligation rather than an attempt to create new material. The ""Violin Player"" CD was such a tour de force that anything after that must be compared with it. But Vanessa Mae's talent should allow her to create material that lives up to her promise. I enjoyed her singing and found ""Bach Street Prelude"" & ""Storm"" among the istrumentals to be especially good. Newcomers to Vanessa Mae should first purchase ""The Violin Player."" Her longtime fans will settle for ""Storm"" until her next (hopefully more even) CD comes out."
2,Not exactly what I expected,"This is my first Vanessa Mae CD and I am still wondering whether if it will be my last. I was expecting some nice violin music and I got what I call a lot of techno music. While I can tell that she plays very well and that she is very masterful in her playing, there are only a few tracks that I do enjoy. For me this is not music to relax to, but is music to keep you going while you are doing something and need to keep going. I may try one of her more classical CD collections, but after reading the online reviews here in Amazon I am leaning away from those also. This CD was truly disappointing for me."
3,Trashy when not transcendent,"3 1/2There are some brilliant, even innovative uses of Mea's very strong violin soloing throughout this Classical-breakaway disc. About half of the songs feature tremendous moments of power, where the violinist's passionate, fiery playing collides with a multitude of genres, including techno and rock. However, for all of it's calculated cool, the fusion does stumble at times with a sound that feels blatantly contrived (some of the mediocre overuse of House beats and silly sampling and come to mind)."
1,did not end up buying product,This was intended as a gift but ended up returning product as someone else purchased a screen.
3,Inconsequential,"In my opinion AHM is not a classic Pink Floyd album. Musically it's just not as sharp as its successors, Meddle, Dark Side of the Moon or Wish You Were Here. It is very similar to Meddlein its understatedness but lacks its consistency and strength (Roger Waters himself does not speak very highly of it at all). It is however, an important record in that it bridges the gap between early, psychedelic Floyd and the mid-seventies, FM-friendly period. It is the sound of a band leaving the 60s behind and consolidating their success with more....ahem...mature fare. The title track is highly unremarkable, with a brass band parping away at some inconsequential melody while the massed choir does its thing to equally negligible effect. Highpoints include Summer '68 and Fat Old Sun - the rest is filler. I know. Criticising Pink Floyd records is a very risky business but I genuinely believe that Pink Floyd's winning streak came with Meddle and ended with - at a push - Animals. oink, oink."
2,"""Rubbish""","Even Roger Waters himself suggested this to the worst Floyd album by calling it ""rubbish"". The only redeeming factors are the Atom Heart Mother Suit was some solid points and the song ""If"" which gives hints of Waters' future song writing potential. Who idea has it to put a microphone to somebody's face while chewing and dub it on the last track? It is terrible! Please don't base your judgements of Floyd on this rubbish! This was an experiment that failed."
2,Save this one for last,"I've been a Pink Floyd fan for many years - and for a while I was pretty much a fanatic. But there is one album I was never able to get into. And believe me I tried. I wanted to like it -I played it many times, hoping it would somehow click, but it just didn't.Yes - it is an important album in the history of Pink Floyd. Without Atom Heart Mother, there would probably be no Dark Side of the Moon. It kindof marks the signpost where the early Floyd turned into the fully realized Floyd. If you need to complete your Pink Floyd collection, by all means, get it.However, if you are new to Pink Floyd, or looking to expand beyond Dark Side of the Moon and The Wall, don't look here. You will be disappointed.With that said, it does have one of my all-time favorite album covers (for whatever that's worth)."
1,Impossible to listen without falling asleep,This CD is impossible to listen without falling asleep. YOu keep wondering all the time if: 1) The muscians are making a fool of you; 2) They are playing with their heads full of alcohol
2,Weirdness,"Another reviewer said ""Impossible to listen without falling asleep."" Exactly, I used to put it on when I got in bed, and it would do just that. I think people that honestly say they like it are just saying it because it was put out by PF. I mean, I am a PF freak as well, but I can also say this is one of my least fave albums, though the guitar work in the first song on the album is good (I am writing this without having listened to this album in a *long* time, which is why I don't remember the name of that first ""song!"")Unless you are a religious PF fan, or maybe just looking to waste money, I would not buy this album if I were you. Go buy Meddle or Animals or something else that PF did - you probably won't listen to this more than once."
2,Overrated album,"I am a Pink Floyd fan, but not in their early days. This album is highly rated by many people, maybe I am missing something but I just don't like it. I can listen to the title track but I call it ""The poor man Echoes""""If"" is a nice ballad. ""Summer of '68"" and ""Fat old sun"" are very poor.""Alan Psychedelic breakfast"" is just ok but half of the song is just sound effect....for early days fans of the 60's and die hard fans !"
2,Snore,"No doubt, Pink Floyd is/was one of the greatest rock bands, but the stuff they made before 'Dark Side..' is either extremely strange of just plain boring. 'Atom Heart Mother' is just plain boring. The title track grows on you after repeated listenings; it contains something new each time that you hadn't heard before, but the rest of the album is bad. The songs have no light or heart. I like the cover. Its kind of funny."
3,Get what you pay for,1st fan lasted a month and died. Just ordered another and it's working good.... for now. Hard to pass up at the price.
1,Another movie by the lake,"I've seen many movies boost the ""OFFICAL SELECTION OF..."" and then some well or lesser known festival title. It's always a hit or miss when it comes to festival selections; The English Patient and Ku Fu Panda were official selections, so movie quality based on the official selection title is purely subjective. The movie looks good but lacks a great script. I can't imagine many die hard horror fans loving this movie but as a horror buff I didn't enjoy it. I wish I fast forwarded through some of it but I give the moviemakers credit for effort."
2,Please enter a title for your review,"Why did a European metal label sign an American emo band? This isn't even decent emo. It's like alt-rock emo. Like they started with the pop-punk emo template, then removed the punky part, so they're left with something that sounds more like Creed than New Found Glory. It's sickening and pathetic and I hate it. The singer sucks too, he has no sense of melody and does all these long sustained notes that just sound like poop. I guess there's a bit of a Thursday and Finch influence, but this music has much less talent and emo credibility than even those bands."
3,a rather half-hearted effort..,"Although I am a big fan of Harlan Coben I have to admit 'The Final Detail' is among my least favorite of his works. Why? Firstly, the plot is not exactly enthralling. Sports agent's (Myron Bolitar) partner is falsely accused of murder under very dubious circumstances. In his search for the truth we encounter the usual mix of sexual kinkiness, death and violence. It *should* be good but it is all very formulaic. And surprisingly, the ending doesn't have the sometimes wild twists and turns found in other Harlan Coben books; it was actually a bit lame. Yet on a positive note, Harlan Coben does write some sparkling dialogue, often to very humorous effect.Bottom line: a disappointment that most Harlan Coben fans will find forgivable."
3,amusing thriller,"This is the first Coben book I have read from the sports agent series, and I did enjoy it. I especially liked the humor and secondary characters. This had more the feel of a Mike Lupica novel than a Harlan Coben book, based on the other Coben thrillers I have read. It was a light summer read, with a forgettable plot, but one I enjoyed while I read it. If you like mysteries that will make you smile a lot, this might be a good one for you."
3,Too confusing,"Despite the glowing reviews of other reviewers who are obviously fans of his hero, Myron Bolitar, as a first time reader of this series, I found that it was all too confusing, with frequent references to characters who have appeared in other books but who have been given no roles in this one, with suggestions made that their parts in Myrons' life have been major. A formerly well known sports star who is making a come back, is found, apparently murdered, with clues found leading to the arrest of Myrons' partner. Add some scenes with murderous transvestites creating havoc for Myron and his friends and the plot gets even more confusing. I'm sure that if you knew who the author was writing about, it would have been much more interesting so consequently can't give this book more than 3 stars."
4,Good read,Myron is a great character and the book is fun and of course suspenseful and flows well. I liked it.
5,The world of a sports agent,"This is an older Myron Bolitar novel. Myron disappeared for several weeks to an island hideaway, and things happened while he was gone, including the murder of his oldest client. The case is a murky tangle, going back to events early in his career as an agent. He has been known to cross the line while representing the interests of his clients, and things can come back to bite him.This is a well written novel with some interesting sidelights (how to cheat on a drug test) and some digressions into Myron's family. You will find a few details about cross dressers and such, and Myron picks up a few scars. Life goes on, but maybe not quite the same."
1,"Bad, bad, bad, bad, bad","This song is just bad. She just isn't convincing singing these words because she didn't write them, and therefore they have no meaning to her. She doesn't put enough emotion as this song deserves and her style of singing changes so many times that it's actually distracting. If you really like Britney, go buy the album. There are better songs by her on there. Don't buy this."
5,Lovely!!,"This is a great cd, i didnt like 'From the bottom of my broken heart' much on the album but it sounds better here, for a start its shorter and there is a new subtle beat thrown in (listen carefully!), the layout of the cd also helps. The 2 pictures of Britney are gorgeous she looks like a princess, and it completes the mood of the song. The song 'Thinkin about you' is on her first album but it still is a great song, although it would be nice to have something new instead. But the remix of Crazy compensates, it really is cracking!! The answering machine message is ok, most people wouldnt get too excited about it, but it does have its uses!! If you are thinking of buying this it is worth it for the remix of Crazy alone, and the pictures!!"
3,"Fast paced, but doesn't really go anywhere.","This book moves along quickly but get repetitive as it goes on. The story focuses on a Waco style showdown between religious fanatics and the military with the aditional problem that the Jesus freaks worship Jason as an avenging angel thrown in. It sounds a lot cooler than it is because as it goes on, there are just too many shoot outs and slaughters involving characters that are either underdeveloped or uninteresting. The story barely covers any ground in 400 pages basically substituting violence for a complex story.Lastly, my biggest problem with this book is that it uses the Jason that was in Freddy vs. Jason and Jason x. He's totally invulnerable and can be shot, stabbed, and whatever else without even being slowed down. This just gets kind of dull after a while. Still, it's a fairly cool little gorror book that can entertain without demanding your undivided attention."
1,Embarassing,"While most of these songs are vapid, the ""song"" ""Ruby Don't Take Your Love To Town"" is one of the most vulgar and backwards things ever written. His lack of tact is matched only by his lack of talent."
5,100% glad I bought it!,"Have had my Doughmakers cookie sheets for more than a year, and every time I use them I am happy about my purchase all over again! They bake evenly and clean easily. I would definitely buy these cookie sheets, and only these, again!"
3,thin lips,"The height of the rim on three edges is less than 1/4'. Not a problem for cookies but for alternative uses - quenching coffee beans perhaps - not so useful. Maybe this is why the sheet seems quite flexible. Also, burned bits get into the ""pebble grain"" pattern and won't come out - gets ugly after a while."
3,disappointing,"The three timelines are very confusing, and frankly after a while boring. Max's concern over age is boring. The story, once it finally starts, after about 120 pages, is good."
4,A good read,"Suzanne Brockmann has weitten an interesting book. This is my first encounter with her work and I enjoyed it. I would read another novel, mystery, by her without question.She managed to put together mystery and romance, which is ok for me and can be enjoyable which it is in this case.Some of the characters are a little extreme but the story does come together in an interesting way.J. Robert Ewbank author ""John Wesley, Natural Man, and the 'Isms'"""
3,OK action romance story,"I have not read any of the other books in this series, so I appreciated all the back story and found it helpful. While the writing is generally very good, I thought the story fell a little flat towards the end. Some of the action (like the simultaneous terrorist attacks) seem incidental to the story. I found this confusing. As a romance, I never really warmed up to Max and Gina but I did like the secondary characters Molly and Jones. Really liked the Jules character and would like to see more of him. Can anyone tell me what is up with these action heroes who never ever sleep? These guys are starting to get on my nerves..."
3,"Fun read, but no where near as good as some of her earlier books","I have to agree with many of the other reviewers out there...this book was just not up to Suz's regular quality of stories! The Max/Gina story had been developed over a long period of time, but I felt like the meaningful interactions between them all happened in previous books, not in this one. It was like this book was the last chapter, but all of the exciting interactions leading up to the happy ending had happened in other books. Jules is the best part, but he gets injured 2/3 of the way through and drops out of the story for a while. I would have liked a bit more on him and his feelings about Robin, especially as I assume they will both reappear in Suz's books at some point.That said, it's a fun read. Just don't expect to be hooked into the story and unable to put the book down."
3,confusing,I liked the story and the tension and the romance--but the hopping around on time periods made this book hard for me because it stopped me just at the point I should have been drawn into the next scene. I had to wonder--as have several other readers--why in the world did she write it this way? Didn't her editor or a few of her readers notice this was not a good technique? There must be some reason I've never read another book in my very LONG life as a rabid reader a book structured like this. Perhaps because it messes up the flow of the story?For me it was a big-named author attempting something creative (which I applaud) but which really messed up the book and continuity--which I can't praise.
5,Cobain Masterpiece,"This is the best $12 I have ever spent. As a die-hard Nirvana fan, I wanted to get my hands on this ASAP. It isn't at all what I expected, but with the beautiful backdrops and Kurt's voice-over, this truly is a masterpiece.There was so much I learned about his life I wasn't aware of beforehand. Growing up in Washington State, meeting Grohl and Novoselic, traveling, drugs, etc...Definitely get your hands on this one. You won't regret it..."
2,I must have missed something...,"I have been a Nirvana fan form the start but this dvd is nothing more than interviews that I have read before with boaring video of locations in Washington. The few stills of Nirvana and Kurt are pics that we have all seen before. If it was released as a cd, it might have been better. I was dissapointed."
1,too much,"you know when people joke about twitter and they talk about how nobody cares that they ate a sandwich, took a dump, had a beer and brushed their teeth. *sorry for the crudeness*thats what this dvd. its a full length dvd of kurt cobain taking a dump on his life. Every choice he made, every squat he stayed and not near as much about the man i recognize from nirvana. It took a few play backs because for the longest time i didnt even recognize his voice. To me it just didnt sound like him. The pictures shown in the film are random. Over an hour into it and not one picture of Kurt. After over an hour one picture of the top of Courtneys head supposebly as he says she reminded him of nancy spungen (who didnt she remind of nancy spungen). I had to watch this documentary over a number of sittings because it just didnt hold me.I expected alot. Ive been a nirvana fan since i was a kid. This documentary sucks."
3,ReHash,"I am a huge Nirvana and Kurt Cobain fan. I've read countless books and biographies. I have seen a lot of footage.This movie was unique in the way it was put together but if you know anything about Kurt Cobain or have read anything about him, this will be old news to you. The interviews used have been used before and I felt like I was watching old reruns. I actually fell asleep midway through and woke up toward the end to shut it off."
5,Amazing,"This is unique to the other million movies on Kurt Cobain. I enjoyed this very much, and after years of obsession it's nice to finally see something I never have before."
4,great purchase,I am truly satisfied with my purchase. the variety the price and the shipping. This is my first review ever . louie
1,Impossible diet to follow,"I commend the author for faithfully following the diet he prescribes in this book- but for the vast majority of people this diet is impossible to follow. He suggests an extremely low-carbohydrate diet, even more so than the south beach diet or the atkins diet. He says to follow a 12-6-6 diet, 12 grams of carbs for breakfast, and 6 grams for both lunch and dinner. I was hopeful that this book would give me a diet to follow, but his diet was just too strict, he doesn't even allow for milk- instead he has you use a little cream mixed into water! ick! I'm sure his diet of protein and vegetables would make anyone lose weight and be very healthy, but for the average person it is just not realistic to think that you can go through the rest of your life cutting out all carbs."
1,Not my cup of tea,"I was excited to purchase the book and began reading it as soon as it was delivered. However, this book was NOT my cup of tea. I don't think a diabetic person should have to give up entire food groups...fruits and veggies especially, in order to bring your sugar levels under control. I have lost 70 lbs simply by giving up processed foods and walking. Bad feet & knees prevent me from doing anything else but my A1C levels are tight, I'm off my blood pressure meds and I take one small pill per day for my diabetes. I'm totally off insulin and have been for a few years. We already have to deal with so much, and I'm not giving up healthy fruits & veggies on top of it all. I was disappointed in the book and sold it immediately."
2,Bad format translation ruins recipes,"This book is essentially two parts. The first part is about carbohydrates and diabetes, and I found it valuable. The second part is recipes, which I found largely useless, because of ingredients lists that contain measurements and amounts like ""H cups"" or ""H teaspoon."" I'm guessing that these ""H""s and similar puzzlements are actual amounts in the book's printed version, like perhaps 1/2 or 1/3, but who knows? In any case, the original text did not make it into the ebook. The publisher obviously didn't bother to proof the ebook, but charges a hefty price for it anyway. I wish the recipes were as useful as the money I spent to buy it."
1,Weird and disappointing,I bought this book before I learned how off-base Dr. Berstein is in the area of disbetes treatment. His suggestions are ultra low-carb and I believe dangerously low. If you are looking for a good reference on type-2 diabetes and how to treat I would NOT recommend this book. Try a publication from Joslin Diabetes Center.
5,great classic rock album,"One of rock musics hit makers of the 70's released a great album with all of there classic songs, cheaper than iTunes you can not go wrong with this purchase. Plus use of the Amazon Cloud and Cloud Player make this an even better buy"
4,Not as bad as some of the other reviewers say,"This book isn't so bad. It is true that the NBME is moving away from using buzzwords in their questions, but many of the questions in this book are useful to remind you of important facts. For example, the first question in the biochemistry section is ""What is the rate limiting step in glycolysis?"" Answer ""PFK-1"". If you're the type of person who likes to study by answering questions (which I do) this book will save you time. I normally make up my own questions as I go along but this book does it for me. And not all keywords are bad -- it's difficult to describe verbally what Howell-Jolly bodies in a manner that specifically hints at asplenia -- it's just plain easier to use the eponym. With those considerations in mind, I would recommend this book, not as a primary source for study, but a good way to form associations with material you've just studied and to remember important, frequently tested facts."
2,I was dissapointed ...,"I must admit, I bought this CD because of everyone's reviews. When I finally got it, I was a bit dissapointed. Almost all the songs have the same beat. Dahil Sa Yo...they dragged it out a bit too much. Voice V however, is a great filipina group...much better to listen to. Makes you proud to be a filipina!"
3,Life goes on,"Sure it's not Golden Earring at its peak.But can we really talk about a bad album here...I don't think so, the 80's have been though for all hard or metal bands and even if G.E. released some great stuffs in the 80's(CUT, SOMETHING HEAVY GOING DOWN),this album belongs to a less-inspired period but still carries on the flame of rock."
5,What if?,What if dave and the guys from metallica could've gotten along. two of the best metal bands of all time. peace sells... ranks right up there w/ master of puppets and arise by sepultura as one of greatest metal records of all time. buy this cd and enjoy!
5,Musically more interesting than 'Master of Puppets',"Metallica's 'Master of Puppets' was my intro to metal in 1986. But I can only bear the title track and 'Orion' these days because they are the most interesting, varied, and complex songs on the disc. In contrast, Megadeth's 'Peace Sells' provides that kind of complexity throughout. While Metallica's rhythms can be a little sterile at times, the tracks on 'Peace Sells' have snaky, tempo-changing grooves that still stand up today. Just try the opening track 'Wake Up Dead', or the title track, or 'Devil's Island'. 'My Last Words' has a climax that is almost classical in its construction, without losing its rip-n-snort. Dave Mustaine's lyrics are sometimes silly, but his delivery is both angry and funny at the same time. I haven't heard these tracks for over 15 years (lost the vinyl album), but they don't sound aged at all. Exemplary thrash metal, and a great counterpoint to Metallica."
5,"""Can You Put a Price on Peace?""","The album that made Megadeth one of the pioneers of the thrash era, ""Peace Sells...But Who's Buying"" remains Dave Mustaine's darkest, and one of his best works. ""Wake Up Dead"" is a true classic that you can't help but put the devil ears in the air and headbang to. The title track gives off a sort of punkish vibe and asks you ""Can You Put a Price on Peace?"" ""Black Friday"", ""My Last Words"", and ""Devil's Island"" are thrash classics, and this is one of Megadeth's best albums, only it was overshadowed by Megadeth's later better releases, 1990's ""Rust in Peace"", and 1992's classic ""Countdown to Extinction"". I suggest picking up all three for a thrashin good time."
2,Not Terrible - But Why Bother?,"This album isn't awful - it's just nothing incredibly special. Meddle, Dark Side, Piper, and Wish You Were Here are all 5-star monumental albums. Ummagumma, Atom Heart Mother, Animals and The Wall are also very good in their own way. But this album just isn't that great. If you're new to Floyd, DON'T buy this. Floyd fanatics who think all of their albums are brilliant are blind in their worship. Floyd is a great band, but this is one of their mediocre moments."
3,Good Album,"the Only reason I bout this CD was for Jugband Blues. Great song, rest of CD is pretty good too."
3,Finding their way...,"With ""A Saucerful of Secrets"" The Floyd carried on when they could have packed it in, and had to deal with the distraction of Barrett. Objectively it's really not that great of an album, arguably their worst (though my personal least favorite is the final cut). It's not that any of the songs are particularly bad...they each have their merits, but they were still finding their way as musicians, sounding a bit disjointed, the songs don't mesh together well, and some (Set the Controls comes to mind) tend to sound a little tedious. But they got better..."
4,Good blow away tunes,"My first delve into pre-Darkside Floyd. Good set of tunes to get blown away to, i.e., let your mind relax. I told my kids that you don't need drugs to get high; just listen to this. Be careful playing CD while driving."
2,Not received the correct product,"I apologize if my English is not good enough. When I purchase something, I expect to receive the correct product. I have not received an yellow vinyl record, but a pink one. There is no problem with the product at all. It is in a good condition, but when you show a specific product in your website you have to delivery exactly the showed one. Thanks."
5,2nd Best Floyd Album,"This album is the Floyd's second greatest creation(their greatest being ""Piper""). More heavily influenced by Syd than most people think, this album is The Pink Floyd when they were truly experimental and pcycadelic. It is a work by a band not afraid to venture a little beyond the realms of normal human experience."
4,I like it,"Wrights songs are very nice to listen to.. Water's Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun is great and Corporal Clegg is pretty good However, I find the title track boring and long.. Juggband Blues isn't all that great, but it's ok and the lyrics are nice"
4,Brother MFC-8820D,"I bought this unit last January. It was easy enough to hook up on my old Toshiba 4010CDT P2 266mgh laptop. Basically, the unit is fantastic EXCEPT for the scanner which still doesn't work properly. I must say that Brother support is not fantastic. I had several sorties with no postive outcome. I even offered to take both units to them even though I have bought an on site warranty. The support guy thinks my Windows 98 o/s is corrupted and suggested I format C and rebuild. This I do not believe as I have a friend who has exactly the same laptop as me and he had his rebuilt just a couple of weeks before. I borrowed his laptop and the scanning software perfomed very poorly. It was extraordinarily slow and cumbersome. My old HP5200 was fantastic as a scanner so I new what to expect. The real test will be when I buy a new laptop soon. If the scanner doesn't work I will take them to task."
4,Predates the Internet Revolution,"This is a good book except for one major problem. It is a book about the use of information systems in marketing that fails to mention the Internet. Written just before commercial use of the Internet was permitted, that omission from the book is an understandable but major flaw.If you want to read about how a firm can use internally-generated data to become closer to its customers, this is an informative book. It also includes some information about data sources that can be purchased from external sources, but that is not the strength of the book.The book appears to be aimed at people in marketing who don't know much about information technology and how the data in your information systems can be leveraged for competitive advantage."
3,No guitar tablature in this one,"This seems to be a good book, but unfortunately there's no guitar tablature. Very often there are two guitars on Cat Stevens' songs and it would have been nice to see both tablatures. Here, you only get the chords. The chords for the introductions are not there either. I know the intro to Father and son is G and C, so why not write it? Not a book for guitarists unless you are a musician that can read partitions."
3,I expected more,"The Naxos sound is first class, but the performance is no match for master Ansermet and his Orchestre de la Suisse Romande. This Sombrero promises a lot at the start with a fast-paced introduction, but from then on it is heartless, plodding and superficial."
2,Leather belt,"Belt is nice, but it doesn't come with a buckle (of any kind.) Now we have to find a buckle to fit it. Lame!"
1,Not Compatible With Vista,"The Amazon listing for this game shows compability with Windows XP, leading one to assume that it would be OK for Vista. Don't believe it - this game dates back to 1999 and was designed for Windows 95/98. It does not work with Vista (even after running through compability mode)- the cursor movement is totally off and makes the game impossible to play. The Windows XP designation should be removed from the listing, or at least provided with a conditional statement re Vista"
1,Parker Brothers Card Games,"Received wrong item, returned it and was not offered another chose with a different dealer. I was looking forward to playing my favorite card games."
4,Funny but strange,"If you like strange music, this CD is for you. Some of the songs may upset some people, but most will get a laugh from the."
5,Real life and hunting,"Great read for people who like to read about hunting and that maybe experiencing a difficult time in their life. Either way a great book. Mr. Chapman combines his hunts and true life stories on how hunting has put things into perspective for him and also how he has learned to appreciate family, life and things we have in such a limited amount of time. I would recommend it to anyone. I also purchased a copy for a dear friend and hunting partner who is minister. I haven't given it to him yet but I am sure he will enjoy it as much as I. THANKS"
2,Small book for the price,"This book looked amazing in the picture. However, when I received it in the mail, it was quite dinky. The price is too much for the size of the book. I bought it for my hunter-boyfriend. I was disappointed when I finally got it."
1,A LOOF AT LIFE FROM A DEER STAND,"Caution to all! This book is not what the title refers to, it is not about Deer Hunting. When looking for books on Deer Hunting I, thought this may be a good book for a first tim hunter. WRONG ! This book is about life,very LITTLE about Deer Hunting, or hunting from a deer or tree stand. I feel my money was wasted."
5,The Stagg Tele,I was stunned to see such a nice looking guitar in Tele style so inexpensive. Less than $90 for the entire package. I jumped to obtain it as I had been looking for a similar guitar in obtaining a Squire for that Twang but the Tele is simply beautiful and well made guitar. It will provide a nice diversion for sounds that utilize the blues style in our music!
5,THE BEST I'VE EVER READ,THE FIRST PAGE OF THE BOOK STARTS ABSORBING YOU U FIND IT IMPOSSIBLE TO STOP READING THE BOOK TILL THE LAST PAGE. SHE HAS NARRATED HER LIFE SO WELL THAT WHILE READING THE BOOK YOU CAN IMAGINE YOURSELF AS A CAMERA AND JUST RECORDING EVERYTHING THATS BEEN GOING ON WITH MOODY FROM THE AGE OF FOUR TILL SHE MOVES UP NORTH.
4,Review for Dubek,Anne Moody had to grow up fast and learn how to help provide for her family at a really young age. She had to learn the ways of the South and realize that life for the African-Americans were unfair and unjust. With all of the responsibility that she had to endure she still managed to make A's in school and get scholarships to college. While working with SNCC she risked her life to stand up for what she believed in.The strengths in this book are the fact that she was thorough in telling about her experiences. The one think I didn't like was after she join in the Movement she didn't let the readers know about how the rest of her college experiences was like. I would have liked to have known this.I would recomend this book to anyone who loves true stories and would like to read about African-American struggles in the 50's and 60's. This book would also be good for lesiure. I had to read this in my english class and I really enjoyed this book
4,Good read,"While a history text book is full of information on the Civil Rights, this book was a look behind what was going on in the black south and how one young woman struggled for their freedom. I really enjoyed it and would recommend anyone studying the Civil Rights, Malcom X, Black Panthers, Martin Luther King Jr. to read."
5,Grab me from the first page to the last page,"I really enjoyed reading this book. Myself growing up in the north, I did not see the problem of the African Americans in the South. I do understand it better."
2,Ok Gloves,The gloves worked great for about 2 days then started to rip at the seams on the fingers.Not worth the hassle of ordering online plus shipping rates.Would rather go to home center and find regular ones.Would not recommend to others.
5,Thank you Yoganandaji.,"Little did I realise that after reading Autobiography of a yogi my life would have taken the turn that it did.Words cannot express my gratitude and thanks to Yoganandaji. Scientific Healing Affirmations is a great book to those who want to learn and feel the power of God's love. Yoganandaji tells us that we are all made divine beings and we can reach our true potential in life by focusing within and releasing our true beauty, strength, love and power. This book used properly will take you there, I'm just beginning to realise the power of having a strong will and conviction. Thank you"
5,Perfect for decorating!,"I Love this little sifters! They are perfect when you just want to sprinkle a little cinnamon, cocoa, or sugar on cakes, cookies, coffee, etc. I keep 3 on my baking shelf; powdered sugar, cinnamon, and cocoa powder. When I just need a little sprinkle I grab one. The plastic cap seals pretty tightly for freshness. Beats having to take out the whole bag or container, pulling out a sifter, and creating a mess."
3,"One Road Man, the title cut, is awesome!","This is in many ways untraditional Ledoux but the best I have heard by far! One Road Man,the title cut, is probably my favorite on the CD. It just keeps getting better and better!"
3,Very Good but too mushy,"I liked the flavor and the texture but my husband didn't. He liked the flavor but called it mush because it was too soft and every time we ate it, we had to wash our hands afterwards because it kept falling apart. I will have to find another product because of it"
4,"Good, not great","I will preface this by saying that this is the first book I purchased on this subject, so I don't have a large pool of measurables to compare it to.That said, there was some good basic information in this book, and it's a good jumping off point. I liked that it gave some general overviews of plants the birds like, and when they bloom, etc.I would have liked a bit more on the specifics of the birds themselves... but perhaps that's best found in a book specific about birds, as opposed to the gardens that attract them. For some reason, I thought there might be a little more of that included though.Overall, I'll recommed it. As stated, it's a good place to start, and using this information along with information you get from your local nursery professional should give a place to begin bringing the bird to your yard."
5,Wanna Chilly Down?,"What to say... hmm.. Well, this CD is so damn good it's very hard to describe! There's no particular style to class it under, either... but this soundtrack seems to tell a story in itself, with the wonderful music of Trevor Jones and David Bowie. Both the instrumental and vocal pieces are not usual of late eighties music, in that they really aren't cheesy at all. You don't even need to see the movie Labyrinth (although you should) to appreciate the great music that comes along with it. If you have seen the lyrics, listen closely, as they reveal more about the characters... specifically Jareth. This wonderful CD is a mix of rock 'n' roll, almost-techno/trancey stuff and even some rosta-ish stuff (Chilly Down). Great for all ages, too."
3,Terrific soundtrack,"I have a tendency lately to purchase soundtracks to some of my favorite movies and I purchased this one specifically for the beauty of Bowie's ""As the World Falls Down"". I was mesmerized by the music in the film's ball scene and I find the music stands alone just as beautifully.This soundtrack is a return to 80's electronica (Trevor Jones) with Bowie vocals thrown in for really good measure. If you're a Bowie fan you'll be happy; his original lyrics/music are classic, even though they weren't chart toppers.Some of Jones' tracks are a little odd (as are some of the scenes in the film...I still don't like the freaky creatures who play basketball with their heads and the music is just as unpleasant to me), but all of Bowie's tracks are a pleasure to hear.Like I said, I purchased this primarily for the one track, but was happy with all of Bowie's productions."
3,The '80s will live forever!,"Some movies transcend the times and are cherished for what they are: The Wizard of Oz is one of those. Others, like Labyrinth, revel in their time period. In the decade of pure cheese (it was the height of slasher flicks, for crying out loud!), Labyrinth stood out as a marvel of technological wizardry, and its soundtrack (featuring star David Bowie, the king of 80s cheese) boasts some nice synth-heavy music, along with my personal favorite from the film, Dance Magic. Chilly Chilly, reminiscent of some Devo song, also stands out on the disc.Like the movie, the CD is a lot of fun, taken at face value. If you want great music, though, try Chopin. Personally, I like them both."
2,"Love Bowie, loved the movie","But the stand alone soundtrack wasn't worth buying. If you're used to loving every song on the CD that Bowie puts out, you'll be in for a big let down. Lets face it, David Bowie and opera just doesn't mix."
5,The Only TV Show,"The Nelsons have brought many great evenings of enjoyment and entertainment to millions around the globe. Theirs is a tale to share with young and old alike. It is a true treasure trove of learning lessons, listening to music, and becoming part of their family."
2,Corgiville Christmas,"I was somewhat disappointed in the drawings in this book, as they seemed not crisp and clear. Also it was apparent that one of the pages was out of order!Overall, this book did not measure up to expectations. Thank you for the opportunity to express my feelings!"
2,Tip Wires,I ordered three sizes of the tip wires in error. I ordered the wrong items and I returned them. Thank you for the quick replacement of the correct items.Peggy
1,MISSING BOX 1 OF 2,"YET ANOTHER UNHAPPY CUSTOMER WITH A HALF OF A BARCONA 10' ALASKAN DELUXE FIR CHRISTMAS TREE. YES, I HAVE BOX 2 OF 2 ONLY. CUSTOMER SERVICE WAS CLUELESS AND REALLY DIDN'T WANT TO BOTHER WITH LOCATING BOX 1 OF 2 FROM THE WAREHOUSE. I AM POSTING IN HOPES OF FINDING BOX 1 OF 2 AND MAYBE SOMEONE WILL BE ABLE TO ENJOY A WHOLE TREE. I AM HOPING AMAZON WILL TAKE THE TIME TO LOOK FOR THE SECOND BOX AND SEND IT TO ME BUT SINCE MY PAYMENT WAS REFUNDED, I WILL ASSUME THEY ARE DONE WITH THE TRANSACTION. NOW I HAVE A BIG BOX WITH A HALF OF A TREE SITTING IN MY GARAGE FOR ME TO DISPOSE OF. NOT GOOD! WHAT A WASTE!ANYONE HAVING THE SAME PROBLEM MIGHT WANT TO POST A REVIEW WITH INFORMATION INCLUDING THE BOX NUMBER THAT THEY RECEIVED. I INCLUDED MY EMAIL IN MY POST AND WAS CONTACTED BY SOMEONE WITH THE OTHER HALF OF THE TREE. IT WORKED OUT FOR ONE OF US TO HAVE A WHOLE TREE AND NOT DISPOSE OF THE TREE PARTS AS AMAZON SUGGESTED. THIS WAS A CREATIVE WAY TO RESOLVE THE PROBLEM."
1,Price was cheap and so was the quality,"I bought this as a replacement for my 89 civic hatchback passenger side mirror. I knew it wasn't going to be OEM quality, but I expected something a little better. I suggest getting OEM if you can afford to. The ""manual"" remote stick portion that you use to adjust the mirror didn't work properly. I had to drill out extra material around the knob to make it function correctly. If you absolutely have to have a mirror to pass an inspection and want to save every penny you can, then this one will work. I just don't suggest it to any who hope to retain factory fitment."
2,wrong title,"The title of this movie insinuates a story of a black man struggling trying to make it through society. This movie is about a lying drug dealer talking smooth then strong arms his way into this man's neighborhood store to use it as a front to sell drugs. The movie should have been titled ""Lying,Thieving Black Man"", the actings ok but it really could've been better. I wouldn't buy this film."
4,"Fun games, too bad only one works under Windows 7","I bought this package for purely nostalgic reasons, recalling all the fun I had playing some Simba's Pride game a long time ago. Only problem, I have a Windows 7 computer. Out of the three games only The Lion King II - Simba's Pride works properly for me, Gamebreak doesn't even start, and Disney's Adventures in Typing for some reason invert the colors, so everything is bright magenta. However, the games were not supposed to run under Win7 in the first place, so I can't really complain.Anyway, Simba's Pride activities are somewhat childish, but that's how I like them, so I had a lot of fun."
3,bags are not consistant,I had a problem with the sealing strip wearing out and burning the bags on my first vacuum sealer. The company replaced the item even though the guarantee had run out several months earlier. But I don't use the item often anymore. The vacuum seal works fine on canning jars but the heavy freezer bags tend to seperate while in the freezer allowing air to get to the food causing burns. I find that using 'Ziploc' types of freezer bags and sucking the air out with a straw works just as well.
4,Nice Key Organizer,"After studying a large number of key organizers, I found this one met my personal household needs. My wife and I have it mounted on the back of our garage entry closet door where it works well and suits our needs. Inside it has plenty of space to organize and store spare keys. The three ""cups"" on the front make it convenient to toss car and house keys."
5,Follow I...,"To go on a musical journey with that crazy dub innovator and certified legend: Lee 'Scratch' Perry! Get this cd right here to experience the genius of Lee Perry to the fullest. It has two absolutely classic and must-have records on one cd! 'Chapter 1 -The Upsetters' and 'Blackboard Jungle Dub'. Both are genuine gems from the vaults of roots dub history. I cannot emphasize it enough, this cd is a must-have for anyone and everyone. Please do yourself the favor of pickin up this cd, and you will take one step closer to Jah and Zion."
3,not a winner,"This ball is weighted, and it clunks around, so my cats can't really grab on to the tail to toss it around. They've sniffed at it a lot, but that's about it."
5,IT'S A COOL BOOK (maybe or probably),The book The Ruby Raven by Michael Dahl is a Suspensful and fun to read.This book starts out with a boy named Finn and his uncle Stoppard.They were entered in a contest for the ruby raven and a million dollars.They had to write a mystery book to enter.They traveled everywhere like Paris and Africa.Someone tries to kill uncle Stoppard in the story.When I started it was a little boring.As I went through it got a lot better.I learned stuff about places.There were sooo much mystery and red herrings.If you like mystery you'll love this book!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,Not worth it!,"Case tore while removing it after only a few days of use. It necessary to remove the case if you want to do anything with the camera except take and watch pics/movies (i.e. charging or downloading) One plus is that I dropped the camera on the cement after the case had already ripped, and it definitley saved me from getting a scratch."
4,WORKS BUT FIT IS A LITTLE OFF,"For a ""drop-able"" camera, this helps keep it from getting scratched in the dropping process! It works, but the fit is a little off, and you have to get used to which button does what before you start using it, since it obscures the buttons and makes them slightly more difficult to use. The manufacturer should have made cut-outs where the buttons are, and made the fit closer."
3,Where is Rondo?,"I usually welcome the fact that an artist tries something different. However, I think this is too radical, too different. Four songs don't sound like Rondo at all. Two others sound similar to previous compositions. However, this leaves the majority of the songs as very enjoyable to listen to. As an album though, I consider this one the weakest of the 12 that I own."
4,Really good!,"I wish I could give this 4.5 stars, because it was nearly perfect to me. I loved the characters, the dialogue was delicious (especially Caroline's internal conversation) and the ending was very satisfying. The only drawback (and it is a slight one and just based on personal preference) is that the plot is supposed to be about Braden giving Caroline ""lessons"" in how to please a man, but they only have two such lessons and and they are all about pleasing Caroline. I love Cabot's writing and really hoped to see a scene where Caroline got to explore Braden thoroughly. Just a small disappointment in an otherwise wonderful book."
2,The Morgesons...,"Terribly, terribly, terribly boring. I do not wish this torment on my worst enemy. Do not read it. There is not even a summary online, which means, nobody could endure the agony to finish this damn book."
5,Music that really moves you,"I'm not sure how else to explain this album other than the fact I was moved by it. I stumbled across it on a United Airlines flight from Portalnd to Chicago. The minute I heard Venice Maki singing - I immediately stopped what I was doing and listened to every word unitl my plane landed. When I checked into my hotel in Chicago the first thing I did was go online to ""try"" and buy the CD. See, this was about 7 months before the CD was released. For about 3 months I would get my Venice Maki ""fix"" whenever I flew United (fortunately, I travel a lot for work). About 3 months ago my wife surprised me by taking me to see him live in Portland - where I was able to finally get my hands on a demo CD! Now I can hear this incredibly talented and passionate musician in my house, in my car, on my laptop and on my iPod - and of course, on the plane.Trust me, his music is worth it and you won't have to experience my dilema."
4,good flow,This is the first book that I've read from this author.It's a good and interesting story;and the story telling has a good flow to it. most of the characters are not developed or not enough was told about them. The ending surprise me due to the fact that it has a last minute twist to it. Overall I recomend this book.
5,Excellent Service,This book arrived on-time and in the promised condition. I will do business with this seller again.
4,Good choice if you liked the movie,I really liked this cd -- I actually hadn't seen the movie in a LONG time and listened to the cd first and it paints such a vivid picture that I could easily recall many of the scenes in the movie that corresponded to the music. And take away the fact that its a soundtrack and the songs are still really great.
4,Beetlejuice,"While this film will never win an award, it is a lot of fun, and a little goofy. We have constant request from visitors to either watch the movie at our house, or to borrow it to watch themselves."
5,A great soundtrack!,"Danny Elfman provides an excellent score to Tim Burton's Beetlejuice (his second film, if I'm not mistaking). The music captures the comical elements of the film, but never loses the gothic theme which is now a trademark of a Burton/Elfman film. The two caribbean songs by Harry Belafonte (Day-O and Jump In The Line) are amusing and adds a nice diversity to the soundtrack, without breaking the ""feel"" of it. Tim Burton tried to add a musical number to Batman without succeeding to the fullest, here - luckily - it works absolutely fine. This is a great soundtrack, and you don't need to be an Elfman fan to appreciate it."
3,"My daughter loves it, but I find it dull.","Candy has a nice tone and a good PR man. My daughter loves this recording because she plays sax and needs role models. Since I'm an old guy, I don't relate to the music. There's not enough jazz in it for me. The dance rhythms are strong, though."
1,"8 Phones - 2 Dead LCDS, 8 dead batteries","We purchased the base station and 8 total phones. Sound quality is great, but after a few months the batteries started going bad. At this point we have replaced all of the batteries at least once - and the new ones are starting to go bad.Turns out they made a poor engineering decision to use Nicad batteries which are an outdated technology. The batteries basically stop taking a charge after a few months of use and have to be replaced.We also had the LCD go out on 2 of the phones.I expect all the positive reviews here are immediately after purchase. Wait a few months and your batteries will die.Also, Panasonic's customer support is not helpful. I have asked them multiple times to just send us new batteries under warrantee. They will not do this - they claim they aren't aware that this is a common problem and they refer you to a service center and it's at your expense to ship them the phones when all you need is a replacement battery."
1,No Parts,"This unit does not ship with the necessary parts. Even worse, the missing parts can be ordered only from Panasonic (Radio Shack will not know what you are talking about) for $30+ including shipping and handling. In early May, 2004 they are BACK ORDERED for over a month!The problem is that the base unit only has two ports for telephone cords. If you have two two-line telephone jacks in the wall, you are ok. If you have four wall jacks you will need two KX-J24 T-Adaptors plus two 2 wire telephone line cords. The T adaptors are available only from Panasonic. On May 3,2004 these were back ordered until June 6, 2004.This phone looks nice sitting on my desk, but until the parts arrive, it is only a two line phone.This is unacceptable -- a $500 piece of equipment that requires unusual adaptors that are not readily available."
1,LCD dies,"Enjoyed the phone, but the display on the handset is gone after 3 months, and I cannot correct it.. panasonic is no help, so I don't reccommend this phone."
2,Not worth the money,"I bought this to replace my 3-4 year old Panasonic 2.4 GHz which worked great all around. This one has some features that I like, but the Caller ID works only about 1/2 the time, even the base doesnt get it, and I get static from about 25 feet away.I thought the new frequency would be better, however it is actually worse in terms of noise, and range.If I could buy my old setup again, I would in a skinny minute, but alas, it is not availiable"
1,"Lots of features, but a poor cordless telephone","This cordless phone 'system' is loaded with features, but, in my opinion, is a poor example of a cordless telephone. I have 2 older Panasonic 900Mhz cordless phones, a KX-TCS970 (6 years old) and a KX-TC1801 (3 years old). Both of these older models are better cordless telephones in terms of general reception quality and the distance you can travel from the base and maintain acceptable sound quality and contact. I called Panasonic, and all they suggested is changing the 'Line Mode' from 'B' to 'A' (whatever that means!) ... unfortunately, it made no discernable difference. Other concerns include bulky handsets, and the handset 'Booster' feature must be turned on each time you picked up the remote handset."
1,Dead Battery Problem,"James Han's review is right on and let me add my own experience. When I bought this phone set, the features, price, handsfree headset, weight and everything seemed ideal. I was very happy. But now, less than 6 months after buying them, both handset batteries are dead and refuse to charge. What use are these features if I can't use them? I wish I could recommend another brand, but the most I can say is AVOID THIS PHONE AT ALL COSTS."
1,Battery is worthless.,"I purchased my phone about 9 months ago, and it will only hold about a 10 minute charge. Do not buy this product unless you want to go through the extremely painful process of sending it back to Panasonic."
4,Outstanding...,"To begin, I love this cd. However, I find it a bit difficult to listen to at times. Kruder's minimalist approach to this piece is definitely noticeable. I guess a way to describe it, is like K&D, only slightly more stripped down/toned down/ and laid back.You can still notice, or feel, the K&D approach, but...it's just different. NOT bad, don't get me wrong, just a different vibe pulses through this one than say any other K&D release, or any other TOSCA release for that matter.All said, this is certainly a very stellar piece of work. Adding to the whole package is the, rather brilliant, packaging concept.Very worth having. Just don't expect a regurgitation of K&D."
4,good replacement,Strap took a little strength to snap on but hopefully this makes it harder to come off. It is a good replacement for the straps that usually come with bags. It is thicker than the usual cushion and so is more comfortable.
1,I've heard better than this,"I bought the cd and played several times. It is already back to the cd cover. So far, between all the new standards cd that I've had bought, Cyndi Lauper's ""At Last"" and Harry Connick's are the best. Cyndi's new interpretations are something out of this world. Give Cyndi a try."
5,CD Collector,Michael McDonald is to Soul and Blues Music as Michael Bolton is to Soft Rock. The songs on this album are not orginials but sung by McDonald using the same inspirational voice as the orginial artist. This is a wonderful CD and great songs!!
1,Is This Really Necessary?,"Does the world really need Michael McDonald crooning songs that were already tired 20 years ago? Get back with the Doobies and do something interesting. This record is cornball and lame. I know, next he and Peabo Bryson can do a Disney's Greatest Hits collection."
5,This album is long overdue!,"As a fan of McDonald since his Doobie Bro days as well as solo career, I've heard it all--the '80's keyboard stuff, the Christmas Album and most importantly, his live concerts. Heard him sing ""When a Man Loves a Woman,"" which needed to be on this album... Anyway, this stuff is great. Its a boomer thing, you wouldn't understand.... There is still a place in pop music for this soulfull voice and this album provides the perfect vehicle for that voice. Sure, the voice shows some age, but I would hope I could sing like this when all my hair turns white, too!! This music is for mature audiences (in the truest sense of the word) only."
2,"Motown, Michael Mcdonald","A bone chilling, one of a kind voice that takes me down memory lane. He sings and expresses what I am feeling. Truly a voice gifted from God....."
1,One of the worst albums I've ever heard,"How did this album, sorry, CD - showing my age - get nominated for two, count them two, Grammy's? This is an awful record.The songs are classics, even the musical arrangements are passable, but Michael's vocal stylings are horrendous. His voice has aged, and not well.I never thought these songs could be sung so poorly by what was once a decent singer. He seems to sound like a bad mix of Michael Bolton and Barry White with a bit of Tom Waits thrown in as a growl. A horrible mix for these wonderful sould sounds.Even my 6 year old daugter hated it.Please, don't submit to the temptation to buy this album it is simply awful."
1,The wrath of Gordy...,"At last! Berry Gordy has achieved the ultimate goal. Motown has truly been assimilated into the collective consciousness of the pop music fans everywhere. The success of Mike's record irrefutably proves this. Instead of over-the-hill recording artists doing remakes of classic tunes like 'Misty', 'Girl from Ipanaema', and 'Autumn Leaves', now they're doing(or undoing, depending on your point of view) Motown standards. And just as they hacked-up and otherwise massacred those classic tunes, they'll surely do likewise to songs like 'My Girl' and 'Superstition'. Watered-down and devoid of any inkling of emotion, soulfullness or funkativity. Elevator-ready, if you will. But of course, in the eyes of the music industry big-wigs, its really more about money than art, isn't it? Long live Motown. Look out Hip-Hop! 'Rapper's Delight' and 'The Message' are next on the list."
2,The way he was ...,Mike's vocal production has developed into a terribly constipated sounding affair. Let's remember him the way he was.
4,CD is a must have,"The first 6 tracks on this cd are absolutely wonderful!!! That voice is phenomenal. Numbers 7 & 8 (Reflections and How Sweet it is) are okay. I never liked Reflections when the Supremes sang it, though. And he takes Sam Cooke's ""How Sweet it is"" through some changes I don't particularly like. Then tracks 9, 10, 11 and 12 bring what you'd expect a Motown/McDonald combination to sound like - perfect. I don't like what he does to ""Since I Lost My Baby"" on track 13. Seems it's missing something. Can't understand why he recorded the last track #14 ""Too High"" - a Stevie Wonder remake. It doesn't seem to mesh with his soulful voice. Overall, I loved 10 out of the 14 songs and it's a must have for me."
5,"5 stars -- puleeeze, more!","The lameness of the previous reviews motivates me to write. Truthfully, I have had the most awesome ""let's get back to roots"" emotions/physicalities experiences while listening to this CD. I had the privilege, as an out-of-towner, of experiencing MM perform at St. Louis' 4th of July festival. Talk about a tough crowd -- all walks of life, all types of ethnicities. Even the most reluctant of listeners was moved to move. You should too, with this recording!"
4,McDonald Does Motown,"I tried to listen to this album as objectively as possible. I am a huge fan of both McDonald and Motown, therefore it wasn't a very easy task. I believe that McDonald pulled off most of these songs very well. Standout cuts are You Are Everything (originally a Stylistics tune, not on Motown), Signed, Sealed, Delivered (I'm Yours) and Distant Lover. I, for one, surely hope that a Volume II follows and that among the covers is Let's Get It On, What Becomes of the Brokenhearted and If I Were Your Woman (changed for gender acceptance....of course)."
4,My Love is Alive...way down in my heart!,"I love this cd! I grew up listening to all of the motown groups and Michael has done a great job bringing back all of the wonderful music from that time. My favorite track? ""Ain't No Mountain High Enough"". I've played it over and over. That song just gets me going...way down in my heart! :-) My kids are about ready to throw me over a mountain. Great CD!"
5,SENSUAL AND RICH,OUTSTANDING ARRANGEMENTS OF MOTOWN CLASSICS. A REAL TRIBUTE WITH INCREDIBLE VOCALS!!
3,Good book but not enough to pass the exam,"I read all the book and I think it's good for beguinners BUT it's not enough to pass the exam if you are not experienced. The real CCNA exam is too hard to pass and the questions on book are easier to answer and give you false idea how the CCNA exame is. There are some few topics on the real exam that the book doesn't cover just like RIP version 2 and others. I think it's better to find other materials to study for the exam, not only this book."
4,A whisper in your ear,"This is a superb interpretation of Jobim's work. Most everything is done in her quiet, breathy soft-spoken singing style. And although her singing is not perfect, her emotion and mood is just perfect. Listening to her sing on headphones, ""Once I loved"" and ""How insensitive"" transport you to a Sao Paolo dusk, as a beautiful woman whispers in your ear, telling you a story, and occasionally brushing her lush lips on the edge of your ear. It makes you want to turn your head and find out how lush those lips are.Its that good."
3,PAT'S BEEN AROUND LONGER THAN TIMBUK 3,"After reading the other reviews I felt a need to write my own review. Unfortunately I have only just perchased this cd so I have yet to listen to it. I just wanted to state that Pat put out an album out sometime in the later 70's ""Pat MacDonald and the Essentials, Low Down"". This album was recorded at a small studio outside of Oshkosh WI. Some tracks are a little slow but one thing is certain, Pat's bluesey guitar playing along with harmonica and great lyrics won me into his listening audience. On all his timbuk 3 albums I can here the resemblance to his ""Low Down"" album and for my love of his style and playing I give this album three stars without ever hearing it. If Low Down is ever released again it will be a must buy for any fan of Timbuk three or Pat Macdonald"
5,Goat heads,"So far these are working great. I have tried every kind of tube and potion out there, but none have worked our goat heads must be left over from the stone age. I am confident that the killer goat heads will not be able to penetrate the tuffy liners, plus they were easy to install. I can not tell you what a huge relief it is to have this product for my sons bike tires. I am going to order them for mine as well now. Thank you tuffy and amazon."
3,After 5 rides... another flat,This product seems to work ok but I would not depend on it. It isn't too unlikely that a thorn will make it through this liner. It happened to me yesterday and it wasn't even a large thorn. I still give it a few stars because I have gone a few ride more without a flat than with no liner. I will probably kick the bucket and put slime in now.
2,First Happy than Horrible Disappointment,"When I first got the IPEVO phone I was really happy. The design was sleek. People no longer hear echo from my end.After a couple weeks of usage, problems begin to emerged. The driver crashes multiple times on a daily basis. People start to stay they hear distortion in my voice (at least once in every half hour long conversation). I thought this would be the perfect solution but turns out to be another huge disappointment."
4,Outstanding GPS device,"I have been using it a lot and i am amazed. Although it is not intended for beginners, it is a complete tool for fun and survival. The signal reception is good even indoors, what is a new thing for me. This is my third GPS device, and it is as tough as my early GPS12 and handful as my Ique 3600."
5,FEATURE RICH,I have used Garmin GPS units for many years and am impressed with the improved features of the 60CS model. It is as accurate - within 10 ft - as advertised.The USB port is especially handy for connecting the unit to my laptop and desktop to upload and download data points.The compass and altimeter are great features that grow in importance with use of the unit.No buyers remorse here!
