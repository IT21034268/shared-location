2,Not worth it to me,"When I first got this product I thought it was very good but now that I've had 2 of them fall apart on me I've changed my mind. I didn't realize how bad it really was until I bought a different brand. It freezes if you skip more than a few songs, It doesn't shuffle well at all, the wheel became difficult to turn on both of them, and if you don't pause it before you turn it off it will not go back to the same song that you last played. These are just a few of the issues that I can think of at the moment.The only reason I took a chance on buying a second one is because I was under the impression that Sansa worked the best with Rhapsody. Eventually someone advised me that the new Sony Walkman works well with it so I gave it a try and I love it. I will never purchase another Sansa product again."
3,SanDisk Sansa e280 8 GB MP3 Player,"Overall, the product is awesome in size, easy of use, available features...I was, however, very disappointed when it just died on me only after 3 weeks of use. It was very well maintained, I even bought a case and everything. Never been abused in any way. Apparently when I took in for a repair, the film inside caused the battery to slip? They just had to move the battery back in place, but wonder how often this would happen and whatelse could go wrong."
3,Ok for the Price,"I purchased a refurb for $25. It's more than I can ask for for $25. But there are many issues that needs to be addressed.1) When player is plugged to the computer to be syncup, and I am all done syncing, even after turning off my computer the player will not return to the main operation screen. I had to power down than back up to use the player.2) The buttons are hard to use for the exception of the center enter button. The others buttons are nearly impossible to use. I am NOT a huge guy, I can't image a person that has larger fingers than i do try to work this thing.Besides the above 2 issues, its a pretty decent player for $25. For the full value, I don't know if it can compete with the ZUNE or Ipod."
5,Great MP3 Player,"This is my first MP3 player, it is better than I tought it would be. Bought it refurbished and what a great deal! 5 Stars!"
1,Product Not Working,"I purchased this product for my son for Christmas. However, we have not been able to get it to work. When we called tech support they said to try it on one more computer (after trying two different computers). I would like to return it for a new one as soon as possible. I hope I don't have any difficulty returning it. I can't find the packing slip in all the Christmas confustion."
1,Mine worked for Four Whole Days!,"User friendly, looks good, great sound, and totally stopped working in less than a week."
4,Excellent product,"This product is great. It has an excellent selection of features on it, ease of use, and is very user-friendly. If there was one down-side I would point out it would be that the FM radio seems a bit weak at times. However, I expect it's based on where you are at the time. It works fine outside, but less good when I'm working (in and around a dairy cooler). Other than that, it's perfect and I'm extremely happy with it."
3,Battery Goes Quick...Won't turn on even when charging,"I give it 3 stars cause it is a decent player, has a large bright screen & is easy to use & load songs into; it holds over 1000. I thought though, for the price, I shouldn't have had to print the entire product booklet from the sansa website to trouble shoot the battery problem. There is no mention about how the player just shuts off when the battery symbol is at or past half way empty and it won't turn back on even while charging. I bought a griffin car/outlet charger. After about three days of charging it in the truck the player finally turned on. The processor in this 8gb isn't too fancy either; the shuffle option is mediocre. I have over 1300 songs in mine & it keeps playing the same songs. It also will always repeat the same mix it started with earlier that same day. This sansa brand is good besides these issues; although I'm going to find maybe a newer version with less gb."
4,SanDisk E280,"After reading all the reviews I decided on the Sandisk E280 8 gig unit. So far the unit has worked flawless. I have uploaded most of my songs and pictures. I still have some room left. The earbuds that come with the unit are not very comfortable, but I already had a good pair of Sony to use. The battery life seems ok so far but I have not really pushed it more than 4 hours. Recharging is quick and painless. I would recommend this unit to all."
4,Allow love to enter into your daily lived experiences,"This book of daily affirmations is valuable in the sense that it calls attention to pathways of allowing love to enter into one's life. Although people tend to define love in romantic terms, this book is also about the type of love that one would share with friends, coworkers, and even the woman behind the counter at the grocery store. It is about human love.I was fortunate enough to get this book about six months ago and it has proven to be an asset. It only takes a short time to read the daily passage and reflect upon it, but the benefits continue to reveal themselves. I have even earmarked my favorite passages and frequently return to them even though that peculiar day on the calendar has passed. In today's world of nonstop activity and individualism, it is beneficial to take time out and think about those things that matter the most - the sharing of love with other humans."
3,Plodding and Inaccurate,"Not to nit-pick, but Hitler was not the aspiring artist after WWI in Munich; it was before the war in Vienna from 1906 to about 1911. The German army was not broken by the Third Ypres campaign in 1917; it folded after its almost successful offensive in 1918 (broken by American soldiers and Marines). So it goes throughout this dull and uninteresting film. The idea of presenting a young Hitler was fine and daring but this movie is watchable only for the fine performance of Cusack as Max."
3,Jail is no place for Tracy,"Being a traditional blues purist and a blues vocalist of 20 years myself, I was disappointed in this cd by Tracy Nelson. She is a fantastic piano player, singer and song writer, but she often strays to other music genres that I simply am not interested in. This cd was not cell block material- does not compare in power at all to Big Mama Thornton's ""Jail""."
2,Bad Illustrations,"Although the idea of this book is excellent and the illustrations are creative, my son cannot tell that it is even food, so he will not even let me read it to him. He is an avid reader (2 yr old) and loves all of his books...except this one. I would love to see this series of books with a different type of illustration."
5,Mom's Family Calendar,Buy it once and you'll reorder every year as long as you've got kids in the house. Perfectly simple and practical. This calendar will be used daily. It's the best of its kind that I've seen over the years.
4,Interesting and Educational,"Full of documents and essays written by unknown people in the 19th and 20th century, you're given an insiders look at how the new nation was forming and becoming what it is today. It helps you understand more about the beginnings of this country. I find it pretty fun to read actually, a whole lot better than most textbooks out there."
3,Filler Up,"The Records did not produce a significant amount of material and never enjoyed a mainstream following of any kind, for better or worse. Their best song was Starry Eyes, an upbeat Beatle-esque rocker with a killer melody and sharp lyric. Starry Eyes initially appeared on the band's first album, The Records, and was a minor FM hit in the late 70s. There are other worthy moments here as well, but nothing to compete with Starry Eyes. In fact, the Records never again approached the quality of that song. As a result, Smashes, Crashes and Near Misses works best as an artifact of the new wave era. It's a valuable piece of rock history, but not a great stand alone album. Of course, hardcore new wave fans would be more apt to enjoy the offerings here and should definitely buy this CD."
4,Soaring Harmonies and Great Songcraft,"Here's the deal: if high pop harmony and solid songwriting is your forte, you can't lose with this one. Not only does their classic ""Starry Eyes"" illustrate this gift but others like ""Up All Night"", ""Girl In the Golden Disc"" and ""Hearts in Her Eyes"" shine and uplift. They simply have some of the most astonishingly beautiful harmonies ever created in pop music. They take thier cues from the Hollies but they even improve on them. You can sink into them and escape reality for a good 3 minutes."
5,the hardest choices,"The characters in this book were so real to me. I will never see the choices I make about family so simply again. The way one person affects a family, the way one family affects a town, this story was beautifully woven and so moving. You won't be able to put it down."
2,Unbelievable,"I bought this book not knowing much about the emotional side of adoption, but this novel left me with even less. Suan Merrell did not develop the characters, and I did not feel a connection to any of them. By the end of the book, I was honestly skimming over the words hoping to get over the fact that I paid ... on this book. Don't bother."
1,Miss lead,I was misinformed I thought the product was 6 items. Only 1 set came in the mail. Please be carefull when ordersing. I know it is only socks but I would not have bought this if know it was only 1.
5,they REALLY are the softest socks in the world!!,I have the womens' over-the-calf and they are amazing!!! They stay soft after washing and stay above the calf instead of falling down all day.Cheaper elsewhere on the net. Check The Sock Company.
5,HOLY COW!,"The question with Shakira is this. She is cute, but can she sing? Can she really contribute something good to the music world. Well, yes and no. Can she contibute something? Definately. Her sound on this album is adding something to the music landscape. It is definately different from the R&B pop world we currently live in. Way to go! However, she is also contributing to the continual objectifying of women. Men are happy she is. It seems most women are glad she is commfortable with her sexuality. Whatever the case, this has been going on forever in the music industry, and always will. madonna has made an entire career of showing more and more of her sexuality to sell record after record. But Madonna also puts out some dang good music. Does Shakira do the same? I say yes. She has some great music on this album. Surely enough to catch the publics attention again, and surely pop enough to find it's way on the radio."
2,Not Impressive,"I really hate to say this but I really did not like this album. I really love Shakira since her first on stage performance of Donde Estas on Siempre en Domingo with Raul Velasco, but she has really changed a lot. She was this really shy-talented woman that produced songs that would have you standing up dancing. Oral Fixation vol.2 is soooo mellow and sad that it's depressing to know that she went from pop/dance/arabic to early 80's American rock. Shakira, you are columbian, please stop trying to be somebody your not. Your songs will not change who you are inside, maybe just your 'appearance' but thats it. Sorry, I only say this so maybe her next album is more 'original'. Bring back the Shakira we danced to at home, in our cars, at work and in your concerts. Pleeeeaase bring her back!!!"
3,Oral Fixation vol. 2,"I found the album had only 3 songs I liked. Overall pretty good, not that impressed. The order was handled very well through Amazon, keep up the good work."
3,Not as amazing as her first one...,"I got this CD as a Christmas present, and was very excited to listen to it. I was, and still am, in love with her English debut, Laundry Service. I popped the CD in and was very disappointed with what I heard. Some tracks, like Don't Bother, Hips Don't Lie (which actually wasn't on my album), Animal City, and Timor(my personal favorite); are amazing! However, the album overall was too ballad heavy and, sadly, didn't sound very different from anything else out there. I loved Shakira's first album because the songs were different from anything else out there. Unfortunately, many of the song's melodies seemed recycled. I hope that Shakira will realize (especially with Hips Don't Lie at the top of the charts) that her sucess lies in the fun, unique songs that got her started."
3,Not overly impressed,"After putting out many albums, one would hope that an artist would grow and become better at their art. Well, don't look here for that. There were a few OK songs, one or two good songs, and that's it. The remainder of this album was boring beyond compare, and I'm sorry I wasted my money on it."
4,Awesome,"I'm not a huge fan of Shakira, but I do enjoy her music. This album in my opinion is way better than ""Laundry Service"". It sucks that the album is not selling very well, and I think I know the reason why: ""Don't Bother""! It's not a bad song, it was just a HORRIBLE choice for first single! It didn't work.Hands down the best songs on this album are track #1-""How Do You Do?"" which starts off sounds very gothic and spooky, and the other being track #3-""Illegal"". Such a soulful and gorgeous song! Amazing!"
5,super cd,"if you like shakira....this is one of the better cd's. a lot of great hits. my grandaughter listens to it all the time, and i never get tired of hearing it"
3,Don't like new greedy marketing,"I'm an over 40 Shakira fan, probably somewhat of a rarity. This CD is not as good as her Laundry Service, but has some bright moments. I like Timor and can picture the little dance she would do to it. What I don't like, however, is this new ploy where she recorded ""Hips Don't Lie"", and you have to either buy the CD all over again or download it. I don't really do MP3, since I have kids and don't use it on my stereo. It's just obnoxious to do this, whether it's as a test or not. I, of course, won't buy the CD again, nor will I bother to download it. I have a Mac, and her website for the download of the video didn't support Mac. I know she and her people want to be progressive, but leaving us old fogeys in the cold is not smart, especially considering we have more disposable dollars and buy concert tickets and music also, although our tastes are more discriminating...giggle."
5,Shakira is back!,"This Album Totaly Rocks! I tought ""Don't Bother"" was Going to be the best song...... guess what? NOT.. I was wrong!! It's just amazing to hears songs like ""How Do You Do"" and its gregorian choir. I'm truly not a Fan of Laundry Service at all. Laundry Service was Shakira's ""Britney Alike Album"" its just not my type. but the true shakira is back! If you like Real artist such as The Cure, The Cranberries, Courtney Love,Petula Clark...I recommend you this album.. It's a Masterpiece...Shakira has grown as a Women but also as a True Artist and not a POP tart.... I also recommend you ""Donde estan Los Ladrones"" & ""pies Decalzos"".... even tho i dont Understand a thing in spanish... the music is great!"
4,Nice mellow tracks,"I found this Cd one day, but I would buy it. Nice chillout complialtion featuring some very talented artists with some special guests(Amel Larrieux, Maxwell). The cd is very relaxing and nostalgic."
1,"A book about people? No, a book about stereotypes.","When I found this book in the library searching for information for a paper on transvestites, I thought that this would be the perfect book, based on the title. I was terribly wrong and disappointed. The book analyzes cross-dressers and defines the sub-categories as if it were decribing a species of animals! ""This means this"" and ""by this age the cross-dresser will have realized that."" I was disgusted by it!It seems to me that the author had no true interest in what he was writing about, he was just doing a scientific study. Looking at the subjects of his other books, I found no pattern whatsoever, which leads me to believe this was merely another piece of research he was getting paid for. It was not about a group of individuals, it was about a clan or herd; a ""type"" of people. Not at all a good source of information.Not every crossdresser follows the patterns that Talamini sets for them. They are individuals; people, not a species."
5,This is the God Staff or Staff of Smiting for a herd of 16 alpacas.,"This is being used at Hope Farm to control a herd of 16 alpacas, and two sheep,. The major problem is contolling motion of the alpaca herd and a few excessively agressive animals during morning and evening trips to and from the barn. It is recognized by the animals far better than the broom handle previously used. It has enough wallop to discourage the larger male alpaca from mounting the small young males. The herd is fine in pasture. The hook fits over stall and pen walls so it can be hung ready to use where needed. This is a very good quality shepard's tool."
3,Bean bag chair,This chair probably costs a little more than it is worth. It does not keep it's shape very well. Before our son sits in it each time we have to punch it back into the shape of a chair. Your child will most likely enjoy sitting in it and climbing on it but don't expect it to look like an actual chair most of the time.
5,Bugs Bunny at his Best,I just love this Video. My favorite Bugs cartoon of all time is on it! Hillbilly Hare is the best! Run out and get yourself a copy if you've never seen it!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,The Noisy Chair,"I was looking for a less expensive cair and I had read several good reviews on this chair so I went ahead and purchased it. Now I wish I had spent the extra money for a better chair. The other reviews failed to mention that it creaks everytime you rock. If you aren't in just the right, usually uncomfortable, position, the creaking will wake up the baby. I have resorted to using our office chair to rock my son to sleep since this chair just keeps waking him up. Bottom line, if you think you're getting a good deal, think again."
2,wood plugs come out,Be very careful with this rocker. I found my daughter putting one of the little wood plugs in her mouth when she was about 6 months old. I threw it away and in a few weeks I caught her holding another plug. I removed and threw away all the little wood plugs. I suggest you do the same.
3,Nice chair but...,"I loved this chair when it first arrived! It was exactly what I expected but after only a few weeks of average use, the seat sags horribly. I feel like I'm sitting in an inner tube. If the chair had better back and seat support, it would be perfect!"
1,Doesn't work!,"This is a software-controlled device, does not have any method to switch manually (as you might expect,) and does not come with any cables.The problem is that the device simply doesn't work: I have tried belkin's software, on both windows xp sp2, and mac os x 10.4. The device does not switch between port one and two--ever, it is stuck on port one.Save your money and buy something else, this is a bad deal."
4,Miles Davis Reborn,"I first heard Terrell Stafford on our cable's music jazz channel. Exceptional! Superb work! Although not a deep, serious jazz student this really caught my hear and was so good I bought the CD. Take a listen, you'll be pleased."
3,Not eay to...,"Call me slow, but I needed to watch the whole series twice until I caught the whole idea and got familiar with the characters. But it was worth it. The story follows a serial killer with an artistic and technological touch on the murders--I loved the figurines they use to represent the murders, wish I could have one. I loved the song, too, creepy as hell, and the excellent special effects."
3,old vs new,It was very interesting comparing the old one to the new one and how different they are. It was good but definetly different from the original.
5,You can teach yourself with this book.,"Our school used this book for calc 3 and I'm very happy with the selection.Our teacher taught the theory part of the material. He rarely taught how to do the work (he relied on the book to do that and it was very understandable and taught well). The teacher's theory helped to get the material to our long term memories so hopefully your teachers' are using the same method.So if you need a book to show you how to work through the problems of Calc 3, buy this one, it'll do the job."
1,jewelry roll by lewis N. Clark,The item was not as pictured. It is funky and of poor quality. The seller did not respond when I contacted him about this.
4,"Gorgeous novel, replete and finest kind","When I finished reading ""Edges"" I whispered to myself -- whoa, I hope she's got another one in the hopper because I very much want to hear more from this particular and fine voice. Israel and Palestine -- they would seem to be our eternally counterpointed voices -- but maybe not. Kudos to Skolkin-Smith for her vision. The voices here are finest kind. It's a 4.5 rating for me."
3,ok product,This is great for proping up your baby to sit up or lay back and play with the gym part but for nursing I give it thumbs down!!! I use the football position which is horrible with this pillow. Also I am a plus size woman and the pillow did not fit confortable at all around my waist! Use boston pillow(looks almost the same) which uses beans for the inside of it because it fits better and is even better to travel with!
2,"I didn't like it, nor did baby","I did not find the boppy pillow to be at all useful as a nursing pillow. We were having latch on trouble and I really needed the support. Baby would slide between me and the pillow. I ended up getting the harder to find 'my brest friend' nursing pillow, which I could not have done without. THAT pillow is awesome (it is flat and form fitting with a velcro belt). Also as a toy for baby the boppy is too awkward to lay baby in. I ended up attaching the top part to a blanket so she can lie under it. That works okay. I gave it 2 stars instead of one bcuz she ADORES the cloth blue dog rattle that came in the set. And I love it because it's washable. But that is one expensive rattle!"
5,This produce worked wonderful!,"I guess different strokes for different folks, even if they are little. My little girl just loved product. She would swat and stare at the mobile and be totally entertained. I didnt have any problems with the mobile or the objects being too heavy. I also used the pillow by itself as a nursing pillow and likewise felt it was a good product."
1,Barely distracted the dog,"We've used Bitter Apple in the past as a deterrent for our dog chewing at his paws and couldn't find it in our local pet store. So we tried Phooey instead. It barely got a negative reaction out of our dog. Moments later, he went back to chewing."
2,Great watch but the band falls apart,"I've had this watch for a few years now, and for the most part I love it. It's lightweight but durable, and feels very sturdy on my wrist. It goes with a suit or flannel and anything in between.The problem: every couple of months or so a pin just falls out of the band, and the watch just falls off! It's kind of irritating to pony up for a titanium watch and then have it fall apart due to poor assembly or poorly designed pins. If I knew that Seiko got their act together and figured out how to make this watch in a way that it stays in one piece, I'd recommend it whole-heartedly. Until then, however, I'd say keep looking. If you lose a pin in the wrong place you could wind up losing the whole watch."
4,Fast Moving Intrigue,"I read 'At Risk"" after reading Rimington's 2009 'Present Danger'. 'At Risk' takes you along with Liz Carlyle out of her London MI5 HQ to the Norfolk countryside. In parallel, we track the escapades of a terrorist and his accomplice, as they move towards their target. It is a gripping story that I read at home but just the sort of stuff I like to read on an international flight.One mess-up in transatlantic speak. It is 'Jeep Cherokee', not a 'Cherokee jeep'! There are some good quotes from Felix Dzerzhinsky (Father of the KGB) 'In any campaign, the first stronghold that you have to occupy is your enemy's consciousness'. And Tacitus, 'They make a desert and call it peace'. Think Warthog."
4,"This first of one hers is good, because she put her heart in it","Good book, even though she lacks writing technique. It's good, probably because she put her heart into it, and tried to show the seamier side of the business, where both good and evil intermix. In this alone she resembles the early Le Carre, before he went all polemic, and tried to proselytize for this or that point of view. But I do wish she tried to learn some more of the writer's fieldcraft-- the How, not just the What. For example, a scene must have a conflict. You don't give info until it is needed as ammo in the scene. And others such. Nevertheless, this first book of hers was fresh enough to stand out. Her later ones, unhappily work less well for me. Four stars."
3,Perhaps a knowledge of geography would help....,"Ms. Rimington has written a reasonably good spy story. But, that someone in her position, would not know the geography of Europe, is almost beyond belief... The Caravan network in the novel was moving Middle Eastern illegals at Esztergom, Hungary across the Morava River?! She might as well have written that the heroine of the book took the taxi in London, from MI-5 to MI-6, for lunch across the Seine... What is this? Are we British Old Boys (girls) who are proud to know nothing?... Oh, Stella, Stella..."
4,Good read by the former head of MI5.,"This is a well told story of a hunt for two young, intelligent terrorists, one home grown, by agents from the British MI5 & Mi6, as well as other law enforcement agencies. It provides some genuine insight into the making and motivation of such persons, the hunted and the hunters; and it set forth what seemed to this reader a quite realistic scenario."
3,"GOOD FOR MUSIC, LAME CAMERA","I did a lot of research before buying this cell phone, however I am disappointed with the photo quality, usually the photos are out of focus or blurry, I hate that, to listen to music it's a great device, I have almost 200 songs in it and it works great, the sofware to add music to the phone, (disc to phone) is a wonder...! So I recommend if you want a nice camera, forget about this phone, its not the best, but for music... its the Best."
5,mystery of cabin island,This was a great purchase for the quality and the price. I would definately recommend this item to anyone to buy.
2,Super Disappointed,"Although this book has a lot of information, it lacks examples and sample problems which help to provide the design confidence I was looking for in an HVAC text. In my opinion this books only value is as a reference for the experienced HVAC engineer."
2,Sunstroke Develops Little Heat,"I've never been an avid Johnathon Kellerman fan, so reluctantly purchased his son's book on a recommendation, I think, from FORBES, Facts and Comments column.Thankfully, Malcolm's take on the state of the economy is better than his taste in popular fiction.Stylistically, the book lacks punch and character development. The premise is strained, somewhat unbelievable. The characters unappealing enough that it's difficult to see why one should continue past the opening chapters.Kellerman seems to like unusual metaphors, many that miss the mark and made me wonder whether or not his interest in creating new ones took precedence over creating a mood to carry the story along.At one point, his trained nurse heroine, wonders how much blood the human body contains. Ah, she must have missed that class. But, nevertheless, she's inventive enough to figure it all out. The question is, does the reader really care?"
5,Great DVD,I had forgotten about this band and stumbled upon an old CD. I searched Amazon and found the DVD. I really enjoyed it. Brought back memories of the 70's.
2,At least it comes in brown.,"Goes on well, and looks good for a while, but the good stops there. It flakes off and causes me eye irritation. It doesn't wash off well with soap and water either, I almost always have to use eye makeup remover. I bought it because there were some good reviews, and I like brown mascara instead of black, but I would not buy this again."
3,really old product,this is the original voluminous mascara.... from like 2 years ago. The mascara went on different cause it was so old. Personally I'd say just go get it at the store.
1,albert the apple eating appaloosa,I ordered this book because my grandson loves horses and is having trouble with reading. I thought this would be a great book for him to practice his reading. I was so disappointed when the book arrived. The packaging was fine but the text was terrible. The stories were disjointed and made no sense. I would not recommend this book to anyone. I could have returned the book for a refund but chose to keep it and use it as an example of the worst writing I have ever read in a published book.
1,Save your money!!!! GO TO THE LIBRARY FOR THIS INFO!!,"If you truly want to learn about NFP, go to the library. There are TONS of accurate information in many books offered there. This book gave a fraction of the information needed to truly practice NFP, and the small amount of information given was very unclear and confusing. Had I not had prior NFP background, I would have read this book and said ""So basically, this book is telling me that there is no safe time of the month, and I can get pregnant at any time.""--information that any woman knows anyway. Save your money and go to the library, there is much more information there."
3,Not the Rick Sebak I know and love,"Saw broadcast on PBS last night. They traveled to new breakfast restaurants. Last 2 were in Portland -- brand new restaurants, trendy, ""hip"" serving veggie sausage and rosemary gravy, and a very strange clientele...... not that there's anything wrong with that.I'm not saying the show is bad... it's just not the nostalgic, Americana feel of Diners, Hot Dogs, Ice Cream, etc..... I hope this is not Mr. Sebak's new direction, I feel I've lost an old friend."
1,"QSU2DVR04 sucks, and q-see tech support too.","Hi, I bought this USB DVR because it has two audio channels, so it is supposed to record audio, but this feature is NOT true!!! This DVR really sucks and Q-See tech support is really POOR, I have been calling for three days and they never answer. Please don't waste your money on this poor DVR and buy a real one."
1,Will NOT work with Windows 7,SuperDVR software will not work with Windows 7 of any version. Customer support said that they will not work on a new driver until official release and that they are expecting March 2010. This is a poor way to run a company. My camera system has been rendered useless by no driver for this dvr. Customer support was abrupt and obviously not looking out for their customers after the sale.
2,"Historically Interesting, but otherwise boring","I love the interesting stories about Americas culinary history, but the recipes were rather uninteresting and rather ordinary. Chef Staib is a genius in the kitchen but I wish I had bought another of his cookbooks instead of this one."
1,Unreasonable format,"A total waste of my money.The format of the cookbook was confusing and frustrating--organized according to the season of the year, which may seem like a nice idea, but unrealistic. Trying to find something nice to cook for the evening's meal meant searching thru each season and then searching the dinners-only for that season. Finally, there just weren't many recipes offered.I wish I could have returned the book, but then I'd have to pay shipping again and it just wasn't worth the time & effort."
1,pathetic,This is the most disapointing cookbook I have ever purchased. I tore out one recipe I might use and threw the rest in the garbage. The ingredients are sometimes processed junk and things I cannot find in my conservative city. Don't waste your money.
3,Not what I expected,I was disappointed! I was expecting more of an actual cookbook. Great information but we need a cookbook for daily use as well as purchasing seasonal.
2,Not the best of cookbooks,"While the content is I'm sure ok, the book is a ""difficult read"" for a cookbook. I find it beneficial to have color pictures when looking through recipes, it helps give you ideas and half the joy of a good cookbook is the wonderful displays of the final dishes! This book had no pictures whatsoever. The display to view inside of the book was unavailable at the time. If it had been, I would not have made this purchase. It is not a cookbook that makes you want to return to it to pick out something wonderful to make. It makes me think of a boring textbook or a techie computer manual.I probably should have returned it, but I'm terrible at making returns. I would not recommend this cookbook to a friend. I purchased it about 5 years ago and have not used it once."
4,"Good recipes, easy to follow","The recipes are easy to follow and to make, and taste great. They certainly are healthy, but can't say if they help reduce your 'real age' any."
4,"Quality product, not big enough for our family","I wish this were bigger- It would be perfect if it were. The holes are the perfect size, the handles are nice and large, but they're almost sitting in the water because the diameter is smaller than i realized... I should have realized."
4,just what I needed.,I've been using an 8oz pitcher and it wasnt cutting the job. I needed a bigger pitcher two make two latte serving at once.This fits the bill and the job. Perfect for making two lattes.
5,Mamou Playboys Special IS!,"Track #1 The ""Mamou Playboys Special"" is about the most you can get out of a Cajun/Zydeco band! It has to be the most up and happy piece of music you want in this genre. Get it when you can. I have only been able to hear it all on KCMU 90.3 FM in Seattle, and on the web, since it is not available anymore. I keep coming back here to order it...."
1,sent the wrong ones,"it woog work if hard right febreze replacement filter for it , sent a 4 pack that don't fit , need the 3 pack"
5,the best dictionary Spanish English out there,"this is the second webster's i buy by mike gonzalez ,the first is old and some pages are missing so i have to get me a new one ,love it mikes gonzalez is the best spanish english dictionary in the market the best ."
5,Loved it!,"First, the bad things: The book was written by the developers of blogger.com (Pyra Software) and they advertize their creation throughout the book. I find it annoying.Now for the goodies: It's a readable book. I read every word without losing interest in it. That's something I could rarely say about a book that describes any technology. It tells the story of blogging, from the earliest days until the day it was published. There are tons of useful links in it and even a database design scheme, to show us how simple a blogging tool basically is. From a business point of view, there isn't much to read about, except for the fact that using weblogs in a business environment is something only few have done so far to tell about it. The book saved me a lot of googling, blog reading and note taking. It holds a massive amount of important links to useful web resources for bloggers and/or researchers. The book has a companion website in http://www.blogroots.com"
2,That book,You've heard that blogging is so simple (by design) that you don't even need a book...well this is that book.
2,What a disappointment !!!,"Waited long for this CD, but very disappointing.Where is Lisa's soul?The mixing is terrible. Lisa's voice gets buried by the music.The music is backward (think 70's disco...)The words ot he song are so simplistic.Hope the next one will be better.I gave it 2 stars because I like Lisa, otherwise it would be minus 2 stars."
4,"Stupid, funny, rockin'","I have watched this DVD 3 times already. It is so funny. Granted, it is a stupid movie but with Jack Black, rock and roll, and Kyle Gass, this is a fun movie. I am a Tenacious D fan and have both music cd's so I was eagerly awaiting the movie. I wasn't blown away but not disappointed either. Overall, just a fun and funny movie."
1,Tenaciously D issapointed,"This was not worth the money at all. I love rock-n-roll parady like SPINAL TAP, THE SCHOOL OF ROCK and really thought that this would be good and funny, boy was I wrong. It really sucked, way too stupid and way too immature, even for me a 46 yr old teenager. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY. Jack needs to go back to the drawingboard before attempting another one of these."
1,Wow.....just horrible,"I like some of Jack Black's movies and I enjoy strange off the wall type stuff. But this movie was horrible. It was not funny, creative, and rocked about as hard as a pixie playing a lute."
2,It was ok.,"The cameos from DIO, Meat Loaf, and the story of the pick kept my interest for a little while...but movie got lame after that. Funny to Dave Grohl from Nirvana playing metal.....but not that funny."
1,Defects all the way,"Russell Watson's singing technique is really very inadequate. He cannot singing loud and he cannot sing soft. He cannot sing long phrases and he cannot sing fast notes. Such defects are present by the bucket in this recording. Of course, Mr Watson can sing whatever he likes, but, to me at least, such substandard fare doesn't deserve to be released."
1,A lacklustre encore,"After a good debut in The Voice, Encore is acutely disappointing. The choice of music is uninspiring and, above all, the singing has less finesse. Maybe Watson is too complacent with his commercial success that he no longer devotes much thought into interpretation. I hope that Watson is an artist of integrity rather than a person who's only keen on making money. This is a lacklustre encore and, as a consumer, I'm not pleased with it."
1,not what I thought,"This DVD was not what I thought. It is not the TLC show ""Clean Sweep"". It is a movie made in Turkey about gambling, guns, etc. I cannot tell - the writing is all in a different alphabet altogether, and I did not watch it - I returned it. I'm writing this 'review' just to let any other unsuspecting person know a little something about this DVD. Since there is no image available, and there was no information to let buyers know what it was."
5,It's Israeli,"The movie is not Turkish, and it's not a TV show- so if you're looking for either of those you will be sadly disappointed.It's a classic Israeli Movie in Hebrew with English subtitles about, as the above person stated: gangs, etc.If you like international movies, it is a great movie, and I recomend it strongly."
3,This book was okay.,"This book was okay, but there are so many great books on writing that I wouldn't recommend this one unless the reader/writer is a huge Jenkins fan. I'm not. No complaints with this book, his suggestions are sound, but it wasn't the motivational-type writing book I was looking for."
5,Practical Advice from an Expert!,"For all of you writers out there...This is a helpful book from a Christian writer whose name speaks for itself. Great advice for novices, including snippets from his own writing career, celebrities he's met, and his journey from an early age Bible camp commitment to his calling as a Christian writer. Highly recommend it![...]."
2,TED BEAR,"I purcahsed this item and returned it . Because it didn't fit my unit, it had stated that it was a replacement item for the unit."
5,Krups Replacement Carafe,"I was happy to find this replacement carafe at Amazon. Krups makes a great coffee maker, but if you have it more than a year and need to replace the carafe, you generally can't find it without an long search. Every year or so, Krups carafes have a subtle change in either the pots or lids, and unless you find the one and only carafe designed exactly for your model of Krups coffee maker, you won't be able to use your the machine. For what even a bottom-of-the-line Krups coffee maker costs, the thing should last a lifetime with care--but don't break the carafe. If Krups no longer makes the model number you need, you're out of luck . . . unless you find the replacement part on Amazon!"
1,the greatest disappointment,"I bought this CD, and when I heard this der'mo, I got very sad.What happened to Sandra (and her yobar')?This CD is one of her worst albums.You should buy her albums 1985, 1988, 1992 and 1995 (if you wish to listen to her good songs).If you are NOT her fan, then you may buy this CD (and not to buy her other albums, because those CDs and this CD are not the same thing)."
5,What a stupid review from Sinitta...,"When I read the review of Sinitta, I had to laugh a little bit. She's writing stupid things.That album of Sandra reached the TOP 10 without any promotion, and it stayed there for a few weeks.She was nominated that year for the ""Echo"" which is the german music-award, comparing with the US-Grammy.To talk about that album as a ""flop"" is a crime.Sinitta, go home... and again I'm not proud to be a german..."
5,These are GREAT,"They do run at least a size small, but they are really nice slippers. These are some quality slippers. They are well made, soft and warm. Great deal at less than $23 shipped. They aren't as light colored in real life as they appear in the pictures. They have a richer color!Buy a size bigger than you normally wear, and you will be very happy."
5,The Best,"TO the point... This hands down, song for song, is the best album I've ever herd. Will always be #1 to me. You have to have this cd."
5,Incredible!,"This is my 3rd savatage album. The 1st being Sirens, and then Hall of the Mountain King. Major devolpment! I thought they would continue their thrash metal 30-minute album. Definite Improvement. Jon Oliva's voice is just.. i dont know, It's incredible. I know it's raspy, but he uses that raspy voice to a new level. Criss Oliva's guitar sound is very unique. Some may roll their eyes and say ""Musicman, the guitar sound soubded like every other guitarist from the 80s."" No, there's some fresh sound to it. Check out ""Ghost In The Ruins."" That's a good dark song. The ending is spectalauar. 2 songs with the limit of 9 minutes, has changed my life and influence. This is so amazing, it's just..words are not enough. JUST GET THE DAMN ALBUM!"
3,Great watch-not so much the bracelet though.,Very nice watch but the bracelet is a folded link style more seen on the lower priced Seiko 5 models. 2 stars deducted for the bracelet
5,great longterm value,"I have had this watch for 10 years, and apart from 2 battery changes, it has kept time flawlessly. I have used it for all types of water sports, without any problems. Despite heavy, daily use, and several drops on concrete, the crystal looks brand new. My only criticizm is the metal bracelet, two of which I have gone through due to bending of the link closest to the spring bar (a solid link would be better). I have switched to the rubber strap, which is very sturdy, although takes a little ""breaking in"" to get the stiffness out. The watch is heavy, which hasn't bothered me except for certain activities like tennis. Overall, great value for the money."
1,A waste of time.,"Fans of the first film can forget about this one cause it's nothing like part one. An overweight female serial killer who kills her victims off screen is creeped out when she keeps seeing a young boy in the background of the news broadcasts reporting her murders. Oddly enough the reporter on the TV is also her only friend and she has a guy friend who's interested in the plump girl. How exciting!After 70 minutes of pointless talking and long, boring scenes of nothing I turned this mess off. Forget it."
5,Worth every penny,"We got this chair for my daughter two years ago. Now we're using it for my son and it's still fabulous. It reclines in several positions to make feeding a small baby really easy. It also glides up and down on its supports, making it adjustable to your own table height (even coffee table height for movie night). Although it seems like the cotton cover would be a hastle, it's really easy to take care of and MUCH more comfortable than vinyl. I hand wash mine right after my son eats lunch and it's fully air-dried by dinner. It's machine-washable too. My only gripe is that the removable tray is too big for our dishwasher. Still, it's easier to take a removable tray to the sink to clean than to try to scrub it while its on the unit.UPDATE: 1/15/2009This chair has now been passed on to another family and has worked it's way through THEIR two children and still looks like it just came out of the box. Great chair."
4,Good Book,"I thought the book did a good explaining all the technologies needed to pass the exam. This along with Transcender or some other practice test software you should be ready for the exam. One thing about the book that I found odd - the book ended the last chapter (chapter 10) with this... ""In the next chapter, we are going to take a look at how you will implement an efficient IP addressing infrastructure."" Huh? My book only had 10 chapters. Maybe Chapter 11 got axed at the last moment??? Poor job of editing whatever the case."
3,"kids love it, parents not so much.","The toy itself is lots of fun for my 3 and 4 year olds. However, the train with 3 or 4 cars attached has a very hard time staying on the tracks. Every time it goes around a turn or up the hill the cars behind the engine fall off. The kids don't seem to mind, but I had hoped it would work better."
3,Good value,"This set is a good value for the price considering a battery power train alone costs around $[...] to start. The track is of good quality although does not fit easily with our existing other wooden track (from Ikea- great quality). Thomas comes with a caboose and they derailed at each corner as the turns were too tight. We tried to supplement with other track to widen the curves but they did not fit together well. After my 2 year old fit a couple of other cars making it four long, it seemed to do well. I guess the weight slowed down Thomas enough and held it down during turns. My son loves to turn the switch for Sir Topham Hatt on and off. Overall a good track and great starter set for anyone looking to start with Thomas. Just a few bugs though."
3,Disappointed !!!,I bought this set for my 3 yr old son for Christmas to go along with an old set I had for years and he was very happy until the engine stopped working.The old engine Ive had for years and went through two previous boys still worked but the brand new one lasted 1 day.Disappointed.
1,Terrible buy.,"Now i know why this was abruptly canceled on TV. Poor humor, poor taste. Save your time and money. Forget it."
3,"Recycling YES, Residue NO","I purchased this so that I could recycle my coffee grounds into the compost pile without the paper filter. It is serving that purpose perfectly. Only issue is that I now have a fine residue at the bottom of every cup and every pot of coffee. I am hoping that increasing the size of the grind will reduce or eliminate that problem. Since my compost pile is more important to me than the bottom of my coffee cup, I give it 3 stars."
3,Beware,"I purchased this as replacement and although it is a nice sturdy carafe, it will not work with model #134 as specified, unless you held on to your original lid. However, when I opened the box there was a note to call Krups if you need to use this carafe with models 134 & 135. Krups was very helpful in getting a cover sent to me at no extra charge, that would work with my model."
2,WARNING: this is BORING!!,"This album sure looks cool, but don't fall for it...I am a big fan of several of the artists/bands on this disk, but this particular selection is snoresville! Almost every track is boring..Its not terrible as background noise, but who needs background noise when you could have so much more?"
4,100 Watt Black Swingarm Lamp,"I bought this lamp over a year ago in hopes that it would last longer than the one I bought at Wallmart, (which I would have to replace in about a years time).This swing arm lamp was easy to set up, I knew I would not be moving the lamp so I permanently anchored it to the desk. I use a high efficiency 40 watt bulb, but, the lamp head will easily hold a larger 100 watt. I move this lamp all different directions, I swivel the head up to the ceiling and down at the desk, the head stays where you put it, it has yet to work itself loose. Good workmanship for a $20.00 lamp. I highly recommend it."
3,nice versatile clock,"I purchased this clock for my newborn's nursery. It is a perfect match to the colors that I used for his room. The tick-tocks are louder than I expected but he doesn't seem to mind; in fact, I think it helps him fall asleep. I wouldn't buy it for an older child, though, who may need a more quiet environment for sleeping. It works fine for what I bought it for."
5,Best TV series ever!,"This is my all time favorite TV show, but this box set does not include the TV movies that wrap up the story. We had to wait forever for this series to be relesed on DVD. Please relese the movies on DVD ASAP."
1,"Great series, lousy discs","This is perhaps the BEST sic-fi series ever. Thge problem is that half the dics in the set don't play. Not just on MY player, but on any of six different DVD players we tried.I'll be getting ahold of someone at FOX, and I WILL get discs that work. Yeah, I am PO'ed about this big time."
3,Alien Nation (tv),"I liked this series and was sorry it went off the air. Though not as good as the original movie, but I still enjoy it. The underlying themes of racism, stereotyping, and xenophobia were generally well-portrayed (perhaps with a little too heavy a hand, at times). The acting and dialogue were all tolerable."
3,Okay. But not as good as Drug Wars II.,"Drug Wars II was 10 times better than this one. If I could find it on dvd, I would get it. I thought this one would be similar. But, not really."
2,Not impressed,"This product got such rave reviews but I was not impressed at all. It definitely was not what I expected, the flavor was bland. I prefer the stella dora breadsticks and will not be ordering these again."
4,Beautiful,"How could this not win the National Book Award? This is one of if not the essential Just novel. It is beautiful and fleeting, like a dream. This is the District, mysterious and perfect and eternal."
5,Just what I wanted,"This inverter works great so far. I haven't used it in long-term applications, but thus far it does everything that it says it does. GFI, automatic temp control, decently high efficiency, etc.So great product, good price, I'm happy with it.oh and I'm sure most of you know, but you can't use it with induction-based appliances (e.g. refrigerators), since it's a modified sine-wave. But I use it for lights and powering my laptop and have had no problems so far."
5,I could taste the difference,"I only bought this as a filler item so I could get a promotional certificate, but it turned out to be a great purchase. I really enjoy good coffee but never realized my paper filters were preventing me from tasting the coffee as good as my maker could make it. It does make a difference, the coffee tastes better, and as more flavor. The oils make the difference I guess! Guests have also commented on the flavor of my coffee. Good coffee starts with good beans and good, cold, clean water. I think it also needs this type of filter."
2,Doesn't fit all Krups 10 cup coffee makers,"I was very unhappy to find that when I put the filter in the filter basket I was unable to close the filter door. It was just a bit too high. I have a aromacontrol 10 cup drip and I expected it to work, as stated, on all 10-12 cup drip coffee makers. Otherwise, I think I would have really liked it."
4,Cheap and let me overclock my Q6600 to 3 ghz.,"This is a nice cooler for the price. It will allow you to overclock a Q6600 Quad Core, Intel processor to 3ghz. Too bad it won't go any higher, but still better than 2.4 ghz."
2,Cooler,"Thermaltake CL-P0370 TMG i1 CPU Cooler for Intel LGA775, will not fit an HP Computer with an external HP Personal Media hard drive slot in the case. It will hit the wire connector of the external hard drive slot. Returned product."
1,Junk in a Box,"All I needed was a way to send a streaming video from my wireless security camera to the computer. I don't care about the software package or editing videos.But this USB capture device did nothing but bog down my capture software. Heck, it wouldn't even work with its own software that came in the box.The computer recognized the hardware just fine. Even my software recognized the name of the capture device. But it couldn't grab even one frame. It just basically froze after a few seconds of trying, giving me a blank screen instead of an image.I tried re-installing it a couple of times. I even went online and updated the driver. Nothing helped.All I can say is the people who rated this product with 4 or 5 stars were lucky. They accidentally bought a good one.My advice is that if you decide to buy this, keep your receipt. There's an excellent chance you'll be returning it, as I did."
1,i don&#65533;t know what happen,"It works well for 2 months. I did use it to record some surgical procedures with endoscopes, but suddenly it don?t work. I hope it has warranty."
1,The Worst Travel System Ever!!!,"I have to say that the only thing I like about this travel system is the print. I have been unhappy with everything. The base is awful to install. If you get the incline right then the base collapses when you tighten it. I had to put a pool noodle under it to keep it level. The car seat is terrible. It never seems to want to lock in the base. The straps aren't big enough and my baby is only 14 lbs. They always cut into her neck and they always get all twisted. They are awful to adjust. Her head always leans forward. It is way too heavy and the handle is awkward. It is almost impossible to get the handle up and down. The stroller is terrible to open and close. When you try to open it is always rubs the ground and it is all scratched up. Also, when you push the stroller it isn't smooth. It is real shakey. I haven't had the stroller collapse yet but I am really worried about it. I would never buy another Baby Trend Product."
1,California Highway Patrol rejected it,"I took the car seat base into the California Highway Patrol office to get it installed and watched two officers work for a half an hour trying to get the system tight enough to be safe. Every time they put their weight on the car seat to make sure the slack was completely gone, the seat would click to another notch in the back. My baby was born pre-term and must have the highest notch so that his head doesn't flop forward. After a half an hour I asked them what they thought and they told me that they had never had that problem before and didn't recommend me using it. I have yet to return the whole system, so I'll see how easy or hard that is, but I am definitely not using it now."
3,Not a true gel.,"I bought two pair of these for our tandem and although the are of nice quality, they are not a true ""gel"" grip. These are more like a medium rubber grip. They would be considered a ""firm"" on the gel scale."
1,Atencion !! Achtung !! Danger !!,El Cd es una cosa (Excelente) Pero este dvd no le hace honor al cd tiene un pesimo sonido (nada que ver con el cd) la imagen es pauperrima y la edición deja mucho que desear.No al Dvd y si al cd de este tributo
5,In my top 10 personal favorites,"I really love this movie.One of the things I like the best about it is how it jumps around a lot but several times things that seem not so related all unfold in one related incident.I just can't seem to watch this movie too many times, I really like the way it was done.I have never really explored the features on this particular DVD, I just got it to watch the movie, and I do that on a regular basis."
1,"Right, keep entertaining us.","The fifth element, the sixth sense, the seventh donnut. A string of movies that all are bad (well, the last one I think they are shooting now). Not to blame Bluce Willis but his charm cannot save the picture. Maybe he should be more careful with the scripts he accepts if he wants to consider himself a respectable actor. Well, who cares anyway. About halfway through the plot takes a nosedive and you really have to tie yourself to the chair to watch the end. Will appeal only to mediocre thrill seekers who have nothing better to do than watch anything that comes their way. There is bad taste in the title as well, the director announces that he has discovered the fifth element - fashion models or something like that. I did not see any women complaining in the reviews. Definitely not worth seeing or buying."
2,Weak plot and dialogue,"I was very disapointed in this film, mainly because it had such enormous potential (great special effects and actors), but stunk so bad. The plot and dialogue were very weak, and Chris Tucker (who is usually good)'s character was so annoying I couldn't stand it! The only reason I gave this movie two stars (instead of one) is because I must admit the effects (especially the city-scape) were very good. But they should've done a better job on the script. The writers could have taken a lesson from ""Stargate""."
2,Yet another load on the big budget sci-fi stinker pile,"A good side? Gary Oldman is good, but when isn't he? Pothead Milla Jovovich shows her breasts, if you really want to see them (you don't). Production Design very well done. Bad side? Willis walks through his role picking up his paycheck with the disinterest showing on his face much like his asteroid movie that came out later. Stoner Milla prattles on with her made up language, and acts as woodenly as if see was speaking english. No chemistry whatsoever between the two leads, alothough Willis tries a bit more. Chris Tucker whose great energy helped make Friday, brings this film to a screeching halt in a Jar-Jar/Prince combo that goes nowhere and adds nothing to the plot or other character development (not that there is any character development). The Professional was outstanding but a wrong turn here by the director. I heard Besson had this idea in high school when he was a teenager. It shows, badly."
2,"Fun Science Fiction Movie, But Disappointing","This was a fun movie to watch...at some parts. Others were pretty disappointing. I think the worst part of the movie is the very beginning. Just when you think a movie is at an all-time low, it gets even lower. I don't know about anyone else, but those aliens in the beginning were a major turn-off in the film. I mean, come on, they look like giant donuts! Give me a break! But, like I said, the movie does have some interesting parts, funny one-liners from Bruce Willis, and just downright ""cool"" scenes. Check it out...but take heed and fast forward through the first five or ten minutes...you'll be glad I warned you!"
1,I wanted to shoot myself ...,"my will to live was at its lowest ebb after sitting through this ""film""... perhaps the fact that its a science fiction film directed by a Frenchman can explain this movie ...hmmmmm....let me think of other great examples of French Sci Fi ......still thinking."
5,horray bluray,"Got it cheap and clear , highly enjoyable movie . Before that my DVD version from my country is hopeless , even though I am using 3 D smart tv"
5,The Fifth Element,"-----This is a fine movie: well written, well produced, well acted by all the actors. It has something for everyone. It is mostly not a serious movie, but largely a comedy. I have seen it over and over. I recommend it highly. Pop the popcorn and enjoy! ---Jim P.S. If you want to see Bruce Willis in a more serious movie, try ""Color of Night"" / Director's Cut with Jane March."
5,Fabulous Movie,"I consider this movie a classic among the sci-fi movies, Luc Besson did a great job, the movie units everything, action, sci-fi, comedy and love. It is a full package! Visual effects are simply amazing, the video and audio quality are even better than DVD version. I have watched this movie over and over, even so, every time I notice something new. This is a ""perfect"" movie and a real masterpiece!Mila and Bruce are great on this movie as well as Gary Oldman and Cris Tucker!"
3,A gag for Chris Tucker,"The movie started out as a good sci-fi flick, then degenerated into a SPACEBALLS meet DIEHARD. (I guess if you can't act -- the next best thing is being an action hero or an annoying screamer). Too bad for sci-fi lovers. As a previous reviewer said: Hey Hollywood; how about giving us sci-fi fans a break? Then again, we shouldn't expect too much out of the Hollywood crowd."
2,"Terrible movie, but the 1st five minutes was great","That pretty much sums it up. The first five minutes or so was really cool, with an interesting sci-fi premise, cool aliens and a nice look, than straight downhill, the rest of the movie was a complete disaster, the is a 'C' movie at best."
1,Highly Over-Rated,"This is one of the worst pieces of sci-fi schlock I've ever seen. I love sci-fi, but this was simply awful. The ""plot"", if you want to call it that, revolves around a cab driver in the 23rd century (really?) who is battling an evil entity during an apocalyptic war (yes, really) as he tries to find a ""fifth element"". Then there's the big ball heading toward earth (yawwwn).It is about as trite and unimaginative as a movie can get. I was utterly dumbfounded to learn that people not only sat through the whole movie, but actually liked it! If you're over 5 years old and haven't seen it, don't waste your money."
5,Eye candy,"Great action, beautiful atmosphere and effects, and a gorgeous alien chick combine to make a sci fi classic. A must have for any DVD collection."
4,Extremely entertaining,"A very entertaining movie, which is quite funny and has some great action scenes. The Jean-Paul Gaultier costumes look great as well as the settings, which are incredibly rich in color and detail. Ony let-down for this movie is the sometimes very apparent plastic outfits for the alien actors, especially the big smurf-woman who sings an aria. The top of her head is clearly made of some sort of rubber. The actors perform great, I especially like the bad guy Emmanuel Baptiste Zorg, who is portrayed by Gary Oldman."
5,I dont know what I loke so much about this...,"But, i do. A lot. On the surface, this movie seems very cheesy, light, and shoty, but if you look at the detail put into this movie it is astounding, from the basic story to the fact that there isnt even paper anymore. Bruce willis plays the usual burnt out cop, but with a little twist, and mila jovavich does a great job (especially since she had to recite a completely made up, but fully working language) I am a fan of sci-fi, and I have seen better, but i really do like this flick, and it is a main contender for DVD. Once again I dont know what i like so much about this movie, but i really do."
1,What a piece of crap movie,"This movie is bad. Horrible plot, bad special effects, bad villians, the whole thing sucked. I usually like Chris Tucker, but in this movie he is SO annoying. Boring in parts as well. Bruce Willis didn't help either. One of the worse sci fi movies I've seen. Want a good sci fi movie, go see Star Trek or Star Wars. Do not watch this."
1,Absolutely horrendous!,"You might like this if you are, say 11 to 15 - but that's about it. For an adult, it is really terrible: unintelligible plot, cheap looking plastic alien/monster costumes, and run of the mill acting. This is not a thoughtful sci fi movie in the vein of The Day the Earth Stood Still, or Star Wars. This is more a cartoon - but a poor one. I wouldn't recommend this movie for any living person over the age of 16!"
1,What a bunch of shills!,"Get a life! This was a piece of tripe and you know it. If the best thing you can say about this movie is Chris Tucker's performance, then you need to reformat your hardrive. Did Bruce Willis pay you to shill your five star reviews?"
5,"Anthony Michaels review of ""The Fifth Element""","Along with great masterpieces such as Forrest Gump, Frequency and others, The Fifth Element is there along with them. It's stunning visual effects along with average acting and a great script, The Fifth Element is worth your time. Trust me. Bruce Willis does a great job. Enjoy it.ALSO STARRING BRUCE WILLISThe Sixth SenseThe Kid12 Monkeys"
4,Wild,"Original, stylish, action packed and often funny; this movie is likely to make all who watch it happy. Willis is perfect as the unlikely hero and Oldman is the same as the sadistic yet humorous villian. This is sci-fi at it's best"
5,The Fifth Element,Amazing! Imaginative! Had the VHS so of course had to have the DVD before the tape collapsed. I wonder how long before it will be considered a classic.
4,Good fun.,"The right amount of humor, nice effects, interesting societal predictions. Poor Lilu gets lots of eye candy shots in tight, tight clothing, and ol' Bruce gets beat to pieces and survives, like always. To me the sound track was the best."
4,Excellent Action Adventure,"Excellent action adventure story of love and breath taking beauty that is not ruined by Chris Tucker, but almost."
2,A futuristic classic?...,...not so fast. This movie belongs in anybody's collection of otherwise good movies ruined by Chris Tucker's presence.
1,Pathetic,"You either love or hate this movie. I fall into the latter category.The effects are great. It's a wonderful transfer, and the sound is incredible, but let's face it, people, THIS MOVIE IS ONE OF THE WORST SCI/FI FILMS EVER MADE.ABSOLUTELY EMBARRASSING.Take a lighter and burn your $20. It'd be a better use of your money."
4,The Fifth Element: Ultimate Edition (2 discs),"The Fifth Element: Ultimate Edition (2 discs) for 1/11/05 at SRP $24.96-will include anamorphic widescreen, DD and DTS 5.1 audio, a factoid trivia track, 4 behind-the-scenes featurettes (The Star Element, The Visual Element, The Alien Element and The Digital Element), film galleries, camera, costume and set tests and more."
4,Blu-Ray Fifth Element,"I like the movie, but You cna clearly see the studio did not clean up this versino from the DVD version. I got this due to its price, and I enjoyed the movie itself."
1,Cant find words to describe my disappointment,"If one of your hobbies is to watch movies, take it from me that one will make you change it. The worst movie I have ever seen. I don't know how such movies can be produced in the year 2003.Cant tell how bad I feel for loosing money buying that movie, if I knew it was like that I wont take it even for free"
1,Coffee Pot Filter,"This filter is not, in my estimation, any good. It leaves a sediment , and the end product, the coffee, tastes terrible. Use paper filters insted for a great cup of coffee."
4,Connection,"Clearly unfinished and yet offers a timeless view of the coming of age saga. Desperate to differentiate herself in a world of appearances and debutante balls, Grady McNeil struggles with the responsibilities of her life versus her own expectations. These of course are hidden from her family and friends, even her best friend and fellow upper-crust outcast, Peter. The reoccurring themes of individual's secret struggles and eventual consequences are foreboding and ring true with modern readers.While not comparable to Capote's true masterpieces, this is not a work to discount. At times, the plot is thin; however, Capote's true story is and always will be with his characters. We are revealed enough to sate and stir our curiosity, simultaneously, while reviving one's own disappointments and all left unsaid."
5,Great album,"Charley Pride is my favorite country singer, so I really enjoy this album.. It arrived in great shape."
1,More Seasons,Lets get more seasons of this well done TV show. We have waited years for seasons 3 +. Where are they?
5,What a joy!,"At last it's made it to DVD! If you loved the show twenty years ago you won't be disappointed. Yes, it is clunky in parts but the human drama is still just as sharp, the storylines are intriguing but not overstretched and the characters are always pulling at your emotional strings. If you can ignore the dated costume (and strangely, this didn't really occur to me until my wife pointed it out) then sit back with a cup of coffee and relish in a series that spawned various imitations. And hey, let's be careful out there! (Couldn't resist it!)"
4,Book contents are wonderful.,"The contents of this book are outstanding, but I would rather have a hard bound edition. The pages are coming apart from the binding. We still use it for our homeschooling."
2,Expect better from Uniden,"This phone has many good features on it and some not that good.. No redial button on the phone, is one example. about 10 months into using this phone the receiver broke! Called Uniden they sais they will fix it, I expect a $150 Phone to last longer than a year!"
5,Uniden TRU8888 5.8Ghz Cordless Phone,"My descision of purchasing the Uniden TRU8888 was based on the user reviews I read. I'd have to say they are right on the money in explaining what to expect. My family has used the phone for approximately 1 month and we think it is great. The clarity and reception is the best I have ever had in a phone. Though we have never used a 2.4 Ghz phone system this 5.8 Ghz is unbelievably strong and clear.The only draw back is that the main station can not be atached/hung on the wall but rather used only on a desk/table. The volume of the ringer on the main base should have a MEDIUM choice rather than just Low and High.The cordless phone works just as great and the fact one can add as many as 10 cordless phones into this system is amazing.I would highly recommend the phone system. I found it well built, reception strong and clarity of voice so very clear."
2,Disappointed,"I recently purchased this phone and have to say that I am disappointed in the corded base phone. It sucks. For one, the mouth piece/microphone is several inches from my mouth because the overall handset is too short. Two, it has a strange echo sound to it that I immediately disliked. Three, why should I have to set the time and date on a caller ID phone? This phone was meant to replace my aging Nortel phone but it isn't even in the same ballpark. I am returning the phone and shopping on Ebay for another Nortel."
1,THEY LIE !!!!!!I IT IS NOT WALL MOUNTABLE!!!!!!!!,"I ordered this phone as a wall phone. Every website I checked, said it was wall mountable(including the Uniden site). When it came, I read the instruction booklet and is said wall mountable to any standard wall plate, but I couldn't figure out how to do it...so I called Uniden. Uniden claimed it must have been a misprint and they were not responsible for misprints. So it was my problem and they wished me luck getting my money back, but sorry it wasn't their problem. Gee,... just the kind of response that would make you really trust what that company has to say in the future. BE AWARE UNIDEN DOES NOT STAND BY WHAT THEY ADVERTISE FOR THEIR PRODUCTS.!!!!!!! WHAT ELSE DO THEY LIE ABOUT!!!!!"
2,Too Much Spanish,"I could't really enjoy this movie because the Spanish subtitles are distracting and there is no way to turn them off that I could find. Don't buy this movie unless you really like (or need) to read Spanish subtitles. [If you need to read Spanish subtitles, then buy your movies from Amazon Mexico or Spain, not Amazon UNITED STATES.]"
2,A rehash of Modern Formula 1 Race Car,By Modern Formula 1 race car it covers the area alot betterJoe
1,bad elevator music,"if you a tango dancer or like the music steer clear of this dog. If you are a restaurant owner who wants customers to linger over coffee and wine, maybe. Not dance material."
4,easy order on replacement coffee carafe,"I have had a Krups Cafe Duomo for 5 years - coffee for my husband - espresso for me. I have ordered replacement parts directly from the manufacturer, but this time I decided to shop around online since the replacemet carafe for the coffee pot is an odd size(8 cup)and shape. Stores just did not seem to carry it and if they did, it was the wrong color. I checked Amazon, it was available right away. The cost was lower than a store and less than the manufacturer. Thank you for the convenience."
4,Convenience product,"Certainly not the cheapest way to filter water for coffee, but makes a real difference in the taste without any trouble at all. We have a high-grade under-sink water filter and these Krups filters still make a difference in the taste of the coffee. For us, each filter lasts a couple of months, so it's $30 a year for better coffee. Compared with the prices at Starbucks..."
3,Krups coffee maker filter,"Let me get this straight - 2 filters for $15? Who do they think they are, Hewlett-Packard selling print cartridges??? The coffee pot works just fine (actually BETTER) without a filter. You can buy a Brita filter pot and pre-filter your water if it needs it, for a lot less money than $7.50 each for the Krups solution. Like P.T. Barnum, said, there's one born every minute...."
4,Good for the price,"Good for the price, though if I should have known they pads were MADE IN CHINA, I would have opted for Duralast Pads at Auto Zone. The fit is not exactly OEM and though all comes together well, as the brakes are easy to service, as compared to the original Brembro pads there is a rather evident quality gap.In terms of performance (and that is why I gave it a 4 star rating) they have been solid with far less dust that the original pads. This sure is a plus giving that the front wheels used to get rather nasty after few days of hard braking. Braking distance is unaffected and grip is as good as new."
3,not in very good condition,"The front cover was bent and it was torn at the spine, I taped the book where it torn, purchased as a gift"
4,Great Read. Lots of Blood and Guts!!!!,I liked this book series a lot and plan on reading more of his work. Thanks for the great read. Rick
2,Strictly for the Kids,"1941's THE INVISIBLE WOMAN hardly qualifies as a sequel to 1933's THE INVISIBLE MAN. It is strictly a lighthearted romp that is marginally entertaining as Kitty Carroll (Virginia Bruce) answers an advertisement for invisibility volunteers by the absentminded Professor Gibbs (John Barrymore). Some bad guys want to get hold of the secret and the results are predictable. Leading man John Howard is good but he is not given sufficient screen time to be effective. Charlie Ruggles as George his manservant grows unusually tiresome by the film's conclusion. However, there are enough amusing scenes and effects to keep younger viewers entertained. The one highlight is when an invisible Virginia Bruce pays a visit on her old boss."
1,"Bad History, Worse Fiction","I can't remember the last time a novel disappointed me as thoroughly as ""Brothers"". I was almost willing to overlook the contrived characterizations and their lack of depth, but I couldn't get past the sloppy history. Mao actually had four wives, not three, and the notion that he was grooming a successor is ridiculous. Mao's only concern for China was staying in power, and he couldn't have been less concerned about what would happen after his death. To top it all off, Chen portrays Vietnam and China at war in 1972, when both were allies fending off the U.S. in Southeast Asia. China's falling out with Vietnam actually took place in 1979, as a result of Vietnamese attempts to expand into Cambodia. Serious errors like this made finishing ""Brothers"" impossible for me."
3,Not Yu Hua's book?,"This is apparently NOT the book from Yu Hua, which was reviewed by the New York Times on August 30, 2006. That book has not yet been translated to my knowledge. I find it suspicious that these two books with the same title came out at the same time, although I could only speculate on what that means."
2,...,"i totally agree with jackie on their live shows. just saw em with flogging molly the other night. they had some odd theatrics, but it made for an energetic show. i'm not a big fan of punk to begin with, but i thought they had some pretty good talent."
2,"Great coffeemaker, but carafe is just too fragile!","We've had our Krups coffeemaker for a few years and it still works great. However, this is the 2nd time we've replaced the carafe. They are just way too fragile and break so easily! When this one breaks (which we know it will eventually), time for a new coffeemaker!"
4,Not as Pictured,"The product was fine and the box was what we ordered, however, what was in the box was not what was pictured. I don't htink it was the vedors fault but Krupts put the wrong product in the box, so it was returned."
1,Not for the average consumer,"I am very disappointed with this carafe. It is very difficult to clean this component and put the lid back on. In doing so, I recently broke the thin glass carafe. Ordering a replacement has been a nightmare. This piece is on back order. I wonder why. Makes me wonder if Krups designed the piece this way. It seems interesting that the replacement part is so expensive ([money]) AND on back order! I may not be the only customer having the same problem."
4,I liked it.,"I'm not an expert when it comes to cajun music, but I know what I like, and I like cajun style music. I heard Hadley J. Castille at the Alabama Crawfish Festival and knew I had to get his album. I enjoy listening to it often."
5,GREAT addition,"You'd think with the high price of the platypus insulator, this would come with it.It makes the hose easier to drinking out of due to the angle this valve creates and the shut off function is great.Your platypus hydration system isn't complete without one of these!"
4,"""Outstanding""","D.L. Menard does a great job as always on these classics. I have one concerned question, What happened to his version of Jole Blon - it's not on here. I feel that having that song missing is such a big deal that I can only give this otherwise Outstanding CD 2 stars!Enjoy & Merry Christmas (12/1/2005)Joe Kopeck - Parkville , MD"
1,Buyer Beware,"The 4 disc version that Amazon offers is a DVD-R set, and it comes in one case. For those not familiar, DVD-R's are the recordable DVD's that are sold in stores, with odd colors on the bottom side. Though it is guaranteed to play, realize that this also effects the potential resale value. Other major website retailers do not deal with this version, and second hand stores may not take it on trade. The 3 DVD set that comes in a 3-case box is the official version that one would expect, and is commonly sold throughout the market."
3,OK!!,Purchased The vidio as a present for the grandchildren. The price and delivery were as advertised. We have NOT seen the video yet.
5,I Love It!,Meerkats are some of my favorite animals.They are so cute!Their attitudes are allot like humans.My favorite character is Mozart.You should watch this show.It is a great show to watch with you're family!I can't give it less than 5 stars!
5,"Know the Story, Feel the Love","Don't start watching this if you don't want your life to be forever changed..this is REAL, Dramatic, Authentic and as Educational as it get's..It is a Wonderful and Painful journey..Be Brave it is Worth it..Most important DO NOT MISS the opportunity to know the Meerkats.Thanks to you, Tom Clutton-Brock you are So important to this world, Thank you for your Dedication, Insight and Passion for your work, and most of all for sharing it with the world....I'm humbled and inspired by this presentation.SincerelyA VERY Big Fan"
5,"Meerkat Manor, the continuing saga","The reality TV/soap opera format of Meerkat Manor is charming and makes it instantly addictive. I am a newcomer, as I only recently found out that for some reason, my otherwise Limited Basic Cable plays the Animal Planet channel. These are interesting animals, and I love the anthropomorphism of the starring meerkats. And the Frank Zappa and Hannibal the bully references--very clever. Sean Astin's narration is engaging, but Sean will always be Sam Gamgee in my mind. :-)"
3,Nice perspective of History of the Grand Canyon,"This is more a history lesson on the Grand Canyon than being one of ""Hidden Secrets"". Although quite informative, it only gives a brief history. The picture quality is pretty good. There are a few places where you can see it was taken directly from film or tape. Nonetheless, it is still very well photographed."
1,Disapointing video hampers film,"After the spectacular IMAX ""Super Speedway"" I looked forward to this DVD, but was sorely disappointed. Many shots have the look of being filmed a little soft, then digitally sharpened, producing a nasty ringing along edges. Also, the camera is clearly vibrating during many static shots, leaving the picture trembling and hard to watch. Moving shots are generally good, though the print shows evidence of dirt and streaks. Narration is pompous, and the attempt at narrative is like the worst educational films. Even the packaging has problems, listing chapters and times for the documentary supplement incorrectly. The only bright point was the sound, which was a quite good Dolby Digital 5.1 channel mix."
1,Another Rip-Off From Slingshot,"The narration is a bore. The transfer to DVD is horrendous...there is frequent flickering on the screen. I had hoped to see more of the Grand Canyon rather than more of the same type of idiocy that was in Slingshot's ""Yellowstone"". My one-star rating is super generous. If Amazon.com permitted me to do so, I'd give it a negative rating."
3,Grand Canyon: The Hidden Secrets,"This documentary is shown in the IMAX theater in Tusayan near the entrance of the Canyon. I like the opening line, ""Man clings to the edge of eternity."" The film focuses on human activity. The Anasazi were the first people in the Canyon. The Spaniards found it in 1540. John Wesley Powell, a one-armed Civil War veteran, navigated the Colorado River in 1869. I was waiting for geology. It never came. The producers aim for a big screen experience and ticket sales rather than trying to impart knowledge. I wondered about the film's subtitle. It seems the secrets might be the fossils buried in the Canyon walls."
1,Expired crippleware CDROM and insufficient depth/details.,"I was excited with the 5-user license trial CDROM of Netware 6 that comes with this book, but we soon found out that it actually IS crippleware! It expired last year in 2001, though we tried installing the trial CD only this year Nov2002! So the CD that comes with it is practically useless!. The book itself we found is not detailed enough, lacking in depth of information, as if it was written before Netware 6 was finally released and as if the author was not quite certain of all the details thereby ommitting many of them and leaving the reader in the dark.But seeing that its been about one year after Netware 6 was released but yet there is still a lack of detailed and user-friendly Novell-authorised Netware 6 books available in the world market right now, this book serves as a can-do, in-the-meantime, reference book we can get. Not the best so far though."
5,Helped a lot,"We really needed a new filter and our coffee tasted much better once we changed it out for the new one. With the filters so reasonably priced, we will switch it out more often."
4,I suppose that it works,I suppose that it works. What can you say about the required filter in a coffee pot? The vendor was johnny on the sop with the shipment. A good experience.
5,They are probably worth the cost,"It is a problem that in this part of the country, there's a lot of minerals in the water supply. This leads to the CALC flashing in my Krups. Changing these filters when I delime the coffee maker each 6 months may be insurance; then again they may be placebos. But Amazon is the best place to get them. And for $55 - $60 to replace the Krups, why not?"
4,Krups DuoFilters Review,I ordered these through amazon prime and they were delivered 2 days later. I have had my coffee maker for a year and hadn't changed the filter (my roommate was the only one using it). I wanted to start fresh and couldn't find these filters anywhere but online and amazon had the best price. They fit my coffee maker and work great.
1,Krupp bean grinder and coffee maker,Krupp bean and grind coffee maker -- very disappointed -- it broke down and would not brew regular coffee in less than one year. Would not recommend it.
3,the little unknowns,I have no idea if these custom made little packs of charcoal are doing anything positive for my morning coffee or not. They seemed to have designed this machine to incorporate them...so I use them as recommended.
5,Krups Filters - a good buy,"Since I can't buy these filters for my Home Cafe coffee maker locally, I finally checked Amazon. I should have known they would be here. If you can't find it - look on Amazon.com. They work great, delivered promptly, and in perfect condition. Easy to recommend."
5,A Great Collection of Essays,"This book gathers together several essays on contemporary Japanese authors. Most of the authors discussed herein are contemporary enough that they have received little if any attention thus far in the English-speaking world. In the niche of contemporary literary voices coming out of Japan, this collection really stands alone as a guide to many of these new and interesting talents.Although there is no unifying theme holding the individual essays together, each one is very informative and generally free of high-brow scholarly lingo, and thus very accessible. Each essayist is a leading scholar in the field of Japanese literature.A must-have for anyone studying contemporary Japanese literature."
4,"Sturdy, durable frother. Must have for espresso machines","Sturdy, durable frother. Must have for espresso machines. I upgraded my coffee mug makshift frother with this frother and feel it was the best purchase I have made for my morning espresso's."
1,just kill me already this album sucks reality ck what?,you no i thought he didnt need cash money or the hotboys till i heard this album bg my favorite anyway this album sucks if will ripe your guts out and feed them to you it was so bad i went into a depression cause i like the hot boys if they were still together gunit would be in alot of trouble and everbody else in the rap game
4,"Juvenile has grown musically, is back, and is better","Even though I think ""400 degreez"" has more solid hits in the form of 3 songs (Back that a** up, Ha (and the Jay-z remix), Follow me now), I still like this album. Juve seems to have grown in his lyrics and musical style. He explores more music themes instead of that hot-southern sound from Mannie Fresh. He also sounds angrier- actually like his voice sounds like he's growling most of the time.lol. My fave songs: What's happenin, Pop U, Rodeo. I think the album is very listenable and has at least one or more songs anyone would like."
4,Some Butterscotch some yellow like lemon!,Juve did it on this album. He kept it N.O fa sho! To me Reality Check is one of his better albums.
5,Highly recommended!,"This book is essential for any pathologist handling the complex resection specimens from the head and neck area. It presents the reader with a well thought-out plan to gain the best possible estimate of resection margins, relation to neighbouring structures et cetera. However, I highly recommend it to all head and neck surgeons as well, who are involved in cancer surgery. ""Surgical Pathological Anatomy"" will provide them with the insight, needed to discuss all pathologic reports from this area."
1,Not So Significant,"When I listen to music,I like it to make me really feel something. Well this made me feel something all right. It sort of scared me because if this is the best music that anyone can offer then I think music is officially approaching oblivion. The music stinks so bad that you can literally smell how putrid it is. The same can be said of the lyrics. If it's real music you're looking for, I suggest you try Nirvana,Hole,or L7. As for Limp Bizkit I suggest you stear clear of this pure junk."
4,"OH WELL, IT'S BETTER THAN THE FIRST CD","I gave the first CD a one star rating, but they sound like they are finally getting good."
4,"Softer then expected, but still good.","Significant Other was good, but I expected it to be better. Three Dollar Bill (The first album), was a hard hitting album that rocked all the way through. This one still rocks, but it seems like it gets softer in the middle of the songs, especially during the chorus. However Significant Other is a much deeper and much better written album then the first. Excellent tracks on this CD are ""Just Like This"", ""N 2 Gether Now"", ""Show Me What You Got"", ""No Sex"", and of course the smash hit, ""Nookie""."
1,why?,Why did I buy this? Nookie seemed like it was a good song when i purchased significant other. However listening to it for a few times got really boring. The other songs like re-arranged don't really help in the process because they too also get really boring.
5,Fan of Rap But this is Classic Metal Rock,I remember listening to this album not my copy but I Listend toit thought it was good and Nookie was on TRL.At the time Nookiewas there I loved the show Carson should come back.But Anywayhere our a few reviews of this Album.Without Limp Bizkit wewould not have any Linkin Park.So stop hating on this album.1.Nookie-I always thought this song was awesome 10/102.Breakstuff-Pretty Intense like a rapper 10/103.Re-Arranged-Pure Awesome Rock 10/104.N 2 Gether Now-Wasn't down with it that much 8/10Fred Durst and DJ Lethal are awesome just face it TheStrokes suck
3,this band is really popular but they are over rated,i bought this cd from my brother since he was tired of it. this cd is ok but for their popularity that they havee u'd think that they'd have good music. Some songs on this cd r good some really suck but overall i give it a 3/5 stars.
1,THIN,The music is catchy I'll say that. But you only need one song to hear the whole album. EVERY SONG HAS THE SAME BASIC GUITAR RIFF. Limp Bizkit found success in one song and they duplicated it. There is very little musical talent here.
2,pitiful,i've heard far better. they're trying to be cool or something putting out mindless lyrics and some semi interesting guitar riffs. the only song i found worth listening to is no sex but the rest are repetitive and sound the same. a waste of money in my opinion
2,"oh jesus, help me","this album was lagging behind Limp's debut album when it was in production. like many others comments may have said, this album has fairly pointless lyrics, all pretty much boasting their sexual appitude and what new friends and connections Fred Durst has made within the hip hop and metal community (method mad, Jon from KoRn, etc...)this album's musical content on the other hand is well put together on the plus side. Wes plays some fine guitar riffs to give a small minority of Limp's songs an edge over the next rap/metal clone.i bought this album expecting it to surpass the underground-gone-sellout first album, but it failed. fairly dismal"
5,Wow. Thats all there really is to say,"Basicly, this is a re-bearth for Fred and the guys. Altough some tracks are similar, there is a defiante varity that makes this album worth-while."
4,"Good...very, very good.","I have the entire ablum already and i must say it is great. My favorite song on it is ""Break Stuff"" it is completely comical...it's just Fred Durst being pissed off at everybody, then Matt Pinfield comes on and starts screaming and cussing everyone out that is tight. His song Shut the F*ck up with Method Man is tight, i was a little disappointed by Jon Davis and Scott Weiland on the album though. THe one thing i don't like is when Durst raps really old school it don't sound too good. Overall,this album is much more mellow than the first which i think is cool...because they are still one of the most entertaining bands around."
1,"Just what we need, More f**cked up sh** nu metal.","[...]Well limp biz-sh*t has done it again. They have released another album to disgrace metal or should I say music in general. If you people think this is real metal, you must be retards. I thought metal was Chunchy / sludgy guitar riffs, death, drugs, depression, humor, bluesy stuff, long hair, insane drumming, raging guitar solos, great vocals. Not this nu metal, rap, sh*t. This album sucks just like all of limp bizsh*ts albums. This music is annoying and a bunch of bull sh**. If you want real metal, get black sabbath, led zeppelin, ACDc, Alice in chains, Metallica, megadeth, pantera, Ozzy osbourne, even Rush and cream can be metal at times. All nu mtal sucks except for system of a down. I like them. But this is a disgrace. Limp bizkit sucks. Let Classic rock, Heavy and thrash metal, and grunge live on!"
2,"It could be worse, it could be KoRn","I feel impelled to speak up against the people who are saying Limp Bizshit are original. There have been rap-metal (yo-core) bands long before Korn and Bizkit, that have done it much better. Try checking out Downset or E-Town Concrete, theyve got actual thought out lyrics, focusing on things in society that need to be changed, not just whining about some girl that they wanted to get laid with. Oh, and why must people throw ""Fred is Hot"" in there, does someone being attractive automaticly make the band great? I think not..."
5,it's GREAT!,"If you want my advice, this album is the best I ever eard... The 2 best songs: N 2 Gether Now and ReArranged.... GREAT!"
1,What happened to Limp Bizkit?,"The only thing that keeps this album from getting 0 stars is Nookie..... What's with the weak songs?? I was highly impressed with LB's 1st album, but this... is... PATHETIC!! There is only 3 songs on here I can stand!! The rest are just plain crappy... like Rearranged... what a BS song!!! CRAP! It sounds like they are trying to be Limp Hanson!! This album was VERY disappointing... I must agree with an earlier review I read, and call this ""heavier Backstreet Boys""... BLAH!!"
3,Not as expected,"In the ""circus"" magazine interview with Durst, he said ""I came out of the studio and still can't stop listening to it, some other artists can't listen to what they do after they come out of the studio"" well, I think that dear Fred's taste in music has change because this cd got a some more Rap color. After the first time I heard to the songs I was a bit disapointed, POWER UP DEAR FRED!"
5,This CD is awesome!!!!!,Limp Bizkit used to be 3rd on my list behind Deftones and Korn. Now they're way above korn. Way. This album is 5 times better than Korn's Life is Peachy and 20 times better than Follow the Leader. It's awesome. (but no one will ever knock deftones outta the number one spot.)
3,I think it will be a good cd,it will be a good cd but it's just not like the first one it's more rap then it is rock
1,The worst band ever?,"Good points: Wu-Tang Clan's Method Man puts in an amusing cameo appearance on ""N 2 Gether Now"". Bad points: his performance only emphasizes how truly awful Limp Bizkit are without someone who actually understands hip hop lending a hand, and how lame Fred Durst is as a rapper and lyricist by comparison. Rap and Heavy Metal make a potent combination if done right (Rage Against The Machine, Faith No More, Anthrax & Public Enemy); this is a textbook example of how to do it wrong."
2,High Sell Out Potential,"The first Bizkit rocked so hard. What happened between then and now is not good. Significant Other is pure cheese. Quite frankly, it seems like the fame and money went straight to their heads, cause this album is plain uninspired and boring. Good guests though."
5,GREAT ALBUM!!!!,"this CD is on of the best i have heard in a long time, it is very good and MUCH better then thier first one, which is more of a ""scream a bunch of words and see if people understand it"" but the second one....you can actually understand what thier saying!!!! its a great record, and i command you to go and buy it! i commanded you to go buy it!! why are you still reading this?!!? go!!"
2,SELL OUTS! SELL OUTS!!!,"Thats what you'll say after listening to this piece of mindless crap. They try to be all melodic and crap and to tell the truth, they fail awfully while becoming a teeny boper band in the process. Dont say no, they did sell out to MTV. The fact that they are on MTV with nsuck and the backdoorboys means that they did. Limp needs to go old school, and totally screw MTV and the teenyboppers. If you want cool music buy $3 Dollar Bill Ya""ll."
1,"Um, there was no option for 0 stars.","Well, where do I begin? The lyrics seem to be written by a 4 year old. The riffs on this album can be played by anyone that has seen a guitar. The guest appearences are lame and probably thrown in as some way of crossing over to a hardcore rap audience (i.e. Method Man). Scott Weiland's cameo is unexplainable. I'd suggest to anyone that thinks this is the best group around to perhaps pick up something by Prong or Helmet."
1,No-Talent Hacks.,"This band is so terrible that I cannot describe it. I guess as long as you are trendy, you can get a record deal, because after listening to this music, it is obvious that you do not need any talent. The only reason that I give it 1 star is because they won't let me give it zero."
3,it's not worth all the hype,"I do have to say i am a bizkit fan but like the first album it seems like they rushed and didn't actually achieve an album where every song is worth listening to.Granted there are good songs on here like the first 5 songs or so,and then it seems to lose it until the end when there are a couple good songs."
1,I agreed with my kid's,"I agreed with my son Earl100%. My daughter Stacey isreal upset because someonecursed her out E-mail style.This was because he hated myson's review.Yes im gonna saythis guy is gonna wind up inBurger King again, working.And I feel sorry for all theone's that E-mail other's toball em out. NO CLASS CITY."
4,Limp's best album and worth every penny!,"If you've heard Nookie on the radio or somewhere you know this cd is gonna be awesome, and don't think for a second your the least bit wrong. Also, other releases like N2gether, Break Stuff, and re-Arranged are excellent. Featured artists include Method Man and Jonathan from KoRn. Over an hour of great stuff."
1,Rap metal=Crap Metal DIE,this album sucks i would never buy it......i heard it at my friends house and i have their old album.......limp bizkit has to be THE worst band ever......fred durst is a complete idiot with an annoying voice who cant write lyrics.....i mean break stuff....if u want violence listen to cannibal corpse....this is an album full of pure crap on plastic the only reason id buy this is to break it
1,SHALLOW LYRICS. HORRIBLE SOUND. VERY DISAPPOINTING.........,"I thought I listened to all the bad music out there until I listened to this CD. I first thought Limp Bizkit was one of the distinctive and powerful groups which stood out from those trendy music crowd of the 90s. I guess I was wrong. I liked some songs like ""Re-arranged"" and ""n 2 gether now."" But they got old after listening to it couple of times. Other songs ranged from simply horrible to fair. I think it is because they have very immature, and shallow music and lyrics, uninteresting at best. The voice of the lead singer is annoying and overly repetitive(no creativity) and the guitarist is simply not skilled enough to make good music. He just cranks up the bass and distortion and plays simple, plain, boring riffs over and over. The bassist is pretty good though. I think this group can be great if they improve on their horrible musical skills instead of just trying to be bad who wants to get laid too much....(just my opinion people.)"
1,(In)Significant Other,"Let me tell you a story. It's about a band that becomes a megamillion dollar commercial success, using only a mangled cover of a George Michael song and some whiny, childish, badly-mixed wanna-be rap tracks. Sound like a fairy tale?Sorry. It's Significant Other from Florida's very own Limp Bizkit.Yeah, I respect everybody else's tastes, but the lyrics really aren't clever or profound like I've heard some people say, and Limp Bizkit could use a good, old-fashioned dose of talent. Just my thoughts. +=SrCosmo"
1,what an impovement!,"i didnt think limp bizkit could do any more to destroy rock, or music in general, but with this album, they have obtained the ample achievment of makeing 3 of the worst cds in history....in a row. this is probably the most unwanted birthday present available. the best song on this cd is break stuff, i took its advice, and this cd is no longer in one peice. maybe if LB one day grow up and stop pretending to be depressed and get a real job AND STOP WEARING HATS and start makeing clever music, they will one day make a cd that is listenable, until then, stick with other bands."
5,Limp Mutha F@%$ing Bizkit RULEZ,I have a stolen copy of this CD and it kicks ass I love it Trust is soo sweet and so is nobody like you feat Jon davis I love it!
4,Good CD,"Limp Bizkit's latest effort blends Alternative, Rap and Metal and does it very well. There are many great tracks on this CD, most of which are pretty heavy. This CD will definitely grow on you after a listen or two even if you aren't crazy about this new music movement. This CD will appeal to fans of Kid Rock, Korn and Nine Inch Nails. WARNING: Once you put it in your CD player, it wont come back out! Yes, its that good! If you are a fan of any of the above bands, or heavy Rock, I highly recommend this CD!"
1,Don't waste your money!!,"These guys have to be the single most over rated band in the history of rock & roll.I get the feeling alot of people buy their CD's just to look cool at the checkout counter.There is not one good song on this CD and Durst's vocals are some of the worst I have ever heard.His Rymes border on funny ,though he is trying to be serious.The riffs try to be hard but they sound flat.The drummer has some talent but he needs to join a better band ...one that allowes him to display his talents.This Band is yet another MTV sellout ala- Britny Spears,NSYNK ,and the backstreet boys.This record is a joke made for posers ....but hey...Im sure it will make Fred Durst alot of money."
3,Surprised me...,"I'll admit, I started out hating Limp Bizkit. It seemed like they were ""lucky"" to catch the current rap-metal trend (which is something I'll stand by, because it DID help them a lot), and they had no talent. And when I listened to this CD, I was looking forward to being able to say I'd heard it, and it was TRULY horrible. However, they actually DO have some good songs; the (real) opener ""Just Like This"", ""Rearranged"" and even ""Nookie"" (as stupid as it is, lyrically, it IS catchy). A few on here, like ""Break Stuff"" and all the interlude tracks, I still hate, but I've got to give the guys credit for doing something decent. It didn't 'rock my world', but it didn't make me shut it off in disgust, and I was interested enough to finish most of the album."
1,This is one of the worst cd that I have herd in along while,One of my friends has this CD and I cringe every time they play it.I just want to say my impression of Limp Bizkit is not to high after listening to Significant Other I can't even tolerate what they are singing.I wouldn't spend a Nickle on this CD some one would have to pay me alot of Money to even think about purchasing this.Whoever you people are that are purchasing this CD you have to be crazy.I don't see what you see in this CD!I would just like to say don't bother listening to Significant Other.I don't ever what to hear any of the songs that are on there ever again.
2,"Yep, This CD definetly was ""Limp""","All of the songs on this album are average at best. It seems everything on the album has been turned into a bunch of B.S. now that Fred is MTV's new poster child. If you are a hardcore Limp Bizkit fan (then something is wrong with you) this CD might peak your interest, otherwise get something from a real band like Slipknot (band that Fred thought got big cuz of him. What an ego.)or Disturbed."
1,Rap/metal the most overrated concept of rock history,"Its amazing how many people enjoy this cd.. but its obvous to me that those people are nothing but sheep that are blindedly led by the record companies and radio stations and such.... limp bizkit is the most overrated group there is and they're pointless lyrics which are nothing but rhymes which have no meaning or history behind them... The only reason this cd gets 1 star is cuz their best song ""rearranged"" is the only song where fred durst isn't whining like a little school girl.. I think sarah mclaughlin said it best when she said ""limp bizkit fans are young males who get everything in life and for some reason still have a reason to be angry"" which was incidented by the riots and woodstock.. i will be surprised if limp bizkit lasts another year if they keep churning out the useless gibberish like their past 2 albums."
5,This album comes with so many diffrerent type of sonds,"Limp Bizkit's ""Significant Other"", is one of the best albums ever written, performed, ad put together. They come out with something a whole lot different than the first and it turns out to be a great album!"
1,I can't belive I have to give this a star!,Limp Bizkit is the worst all he does is talk it isn't even muisc and he obsessed with bad words. And he bad as heck!
3,I think its explicit yet good,"i really have not listened to the whole cd myself, so i just know some of the songs but what i've heard really kicks, and thats all i have to say. i just wanna say that this is a stupid um website thing cuz it doesn't let you listen to the cd before you buy it and if it does then i sure didn't iknow it but whatever..i must go on ot finish recording our new song ""romanoff and the family"""
3,Filler album,"It's not that bad, but there is nothing that we are going to remember ten years from now. LB is a fad, a filler band in between the true true trendsetters. They may be good, but definatly nothing remarkable."
4,limp bizkit kiks it,"I've been listening to this band since their first album three dollar bill came out, and they have always been awesome. I love the way they integrate hip hop and rock, something that should be done by more bands and probably will be. They are reminiscent of Sublime in that way. Their first album is a little more hardcore, than their new cd, but I actually really like the new one. I read some articles before it came out on their new songs, and the artists they were working with. Wu-tang is so tight, and I was getting really excited to hear their new sound. They definitely have something good going on here, and although they're getting a little played out because of demented dj's, I am still lovin' it. I'm happy for them to be getting so much attention and I don't think they've sold out. As long as they're still writing their own songs, staying true to themselves, and pushing the limits of musical style and trends, they're cool in my book."
3,rock n' rap,"Before buying Significant Other I was quite aware that Limp Bizkit was one of the bands that enjoyed blening elements of different music together. But, this CD has only 2 songs actually sung by Fred and rest are rapped by him. I'm a rock fan more than rap and found it a bit disappointing. Fred can sing, and I think he can use those skills more."
1,pure garbage,How anyone can support these bunch of no talents is beyond me. This disc is a shining example of how far the music business has fallen. L.B. are an amalgamation of about five different bands which they poorly imitate.
1,Wow Im disappointed in andreaabs...,"I thought he liked real metal and then gives this 4 stars??? Hmmm, very odd.But seriously what else did you expect me to give this dreck??!! Why did Fred have to always act like an obnoxious a-hole all the time and try to be tough? I don't get it man, I just don,t and never did either, even back in 8th/9th grade when this came out. I have to admit I think metalcore is worst though and so is Kanye Waste. I hate when those metalcore fa**ots scream like p*ssies, it pisses me off. DIE LIMP BIZKIT DIE! LONG LIVE REAL METAL!!!!!Bizquick fans please do yourself a favor and buy real metal like Slayer, Anthrax, Metallica (80s) Megadeth, etc. LATER."
1,Try - Hard's,"I think people who enjoy listening to Limp Bizkit must have been dropped at birth. How can someone say they have a message in their lyrics ' I did it all for the nookie'?, come on! The only thing this band has going for them is they look like they have a pretty talented drummer ( even though he looks a bit like a monkey )."
4,I Dit it all for the...,"Comin' off ""Three Dollar Bill Y'all $"" This Cd's not what you would expect from LB. Some off the tracks are hot though, ""n 2gether now"" with the Meth, ""Nobody Like You"" w/ Jon Davis and ""Just Like This"". Go out and buy it...you need this CD."
1,[bad],"i dont like this cd. this band just gets worse and worse. Wes, being the only talented member of this group, was smart for leaving. the hip-hop direction and Fred's ego dont work at all for this band. they should have stayed more rock like on 3DB. thats all im saying on this one. peace."
1,This is NOT the best!!!,"For all you fans of Limp Bizkit out there, I say you can do better. There are so many better groups out there. First of all I don't understand why they have to cuss so much, it shows their lack of talent for writting lyrics. If you want to hear a truly good Hip-Hop Hardcore band try ""The Fundamental Elements of Southtown,"" by P.O.D. (Payable On Death). They formed in 1992, so they are technically the first Rap-core band. So instead of ""Limp Bizkit, Kid Rock, KoRn, Deftones, or Rage Against The Machine,"" try ""P.O.D."""
1,What are they saying????,I do it for the nookie?So you can have a cookie?Stinkin' up your hand?That's my best guess. Even if I'm wrong...this is bad.
2,A Disgrace to the name of rock,"That's right. I just can't stand this CD. For the the information of everyone who likes this trash passed of as rock, this isn't real hard rock or metal. It's much better defined as TRASH. that's right, TRASH. The definition of real hard rock is deep powerful songwriting combined with explosive guitars and that all-powerful edge that comes with it-not some guys in tattoos screaming about sex and women and throwing together this garbage in one month. You want real hard rock? Try CDs like Metallica:The black Album. Metallica:Ride the Lightning. Guns N Roses:Appetite for Destruction. Nirvana:Nevermind, for a few examples."
3,it's ok...,"This CD is ok it's one of those where you really like it or you really don't it's not as 'hardcore' as ""3 Dollar Bill, Y'all"" obviously they have officially strayed from that 'hardcore' path into a realm of lighter more corny sound that's catchy to most teens but it retains enough cursing to worry most parental groups most of the songs on this CD have to do with Fred's past lovers in some way or another then followed by his constant excuses of why he did something (Example: Nookie) so if you are a teenybopper or are a sporty person i suggest you buy this CD (if you haven't already) and if you can't buy ICP's latest 'hit' because of it's content or something close to that i suggest you try this band out"
4,i recomend it,"this is a great cd. it should go diamond its so good. it never gets old. if ur looking 4 a good rock album, this is what ur looking 4. if any1 tries 2 copy limp they will never be as good. and thats a fact!"
2,Junk,"I don't care what others think. Some songs on this CD are good, but just hearing ""'n together now"" with Method Man makes my stomach turn. HOW COULD FRED DURST MAKE A RAP SONG? Rap with a great guitar in the backround is fine but REAL PURE RAP is just sick. A lot of other bombed songs like Nookie and No Sex really makes this album junk."
1,Don't Bother. Much better hardcore out there,"Wow, the The ""New Kids On The Block"" phoenomenon has struck America's youth again. A talentless group of ""bad boys"" use a couple of catch phrases to become trendy, and soon all the misunderstood kids start following like sheep. How sad. The Fred Durst Abomination (otherwise known as Limpbizkit) could not dissapear soon enough. If you want to hear true rage and passion in hardcore music, throw on Slipknot's new one or even an old Helmet album. Skip this overhyped pile of monkey waste and try growing a brain. And remember kids, just because its on MTV doesn't mean its good."
1,Limp Bizkit: Poseurs of the Century,"Significant Other is a boring dose of cliche MTV rap-metal. This one sounds even more commercial and radio-friendly (is that possible?) than Limp Bizkits debut. I would say these guys sold out, but they never had an ounce of musical integrity to begin with. Wes Borland still quite hasn't found out how to operate the basic mechanics of the guitar, with the most repetitive and simple riffs I have ever heard. And of course wigger Fred Durst yells the typical inane lyrics that make surburban white kids drool. Overall a pitiful excuse for an album (does make for a nice coaster though). If you are a true independent-thinker you will not let MTV dictate what you listen to and reject all the weak trends the corporate suits of the industry spew. Don't allow yourself to be just another sheep in the herd, skip pass this album and search for music you like. In a few years Limp Bizkit will be laughed at just like Vanilla Ice and Milli Vanilli are now."
4,I used to enjoyed it very much . . .,". . . but now this album isn't as great as I thought they were back in the days. ""Three Dollar Bill Y'all"" was heavy, probably the heaviest album Limp Bizkit has ever released. And it had depressing moments found in songs like ""Stalemate"" and ""Nobody Loves Me"". Here, the depression is smaller, and the crazy liveliness found in ""Chocolate Starfish"" is becoming more constant. I now have mixed feelings about this album. Songs like ""I'm Broke"" and ""Don't Go Off Wandering"" have that familiar Three Dollar Bill heaviness, which I admire very much. ""Just Like This"", ""N 2 Gether Now"" and ""Nookie"" just don't add up. And ""No Sex"" is just downright crappy.In short, this just isn't as good as Limp Bizkit's first album. But it doesn't go downhill from here; it does in ""Chocolate Starfish.""Grade: B-"
5,The best cd ever made!,"WOW! what a great cd! I loved it, The lyrics to the songs were great! Iam now playin the electric guitar because of them. The beats were amazing! everything on the cd was amazing! I fell in love with this band the day I heard them! It's one of those cds where you like every song on the whole album and don't skip any songs."
1,one of the worst cds of all time,"This is like the worst cd with the exception of maybe nsync or kidrock.It was making me sick reading some good reviews on this cd.Most new music besides deftones and a couple of other bands sucks but limp bizkit is one of the worst bands.The lyrics are terrible.You can tell just by reading the song titles like nookie and break stuff.Its stupid.Limp bizkit and almost every band thats popular now is just a total rippoff of rage(who have been around since 91) Whatever happened to bands like nirvana and soundgarden.Good bands that had good lyrics,guitar solos and actually sang(not just rapped or screamed about meaningless crap) limp bizkit have no talent or passion.They just play their music(if you want to call it that) to get a lot of money so when some new fad comes along and no one cares about them anymore they can still buy their expensive clothes.Why did i give this one star?Because they wont let me give it negative numbers."
4,it is da domb. i like NOOKIE too.,nookie is awesome. i wanted to see the concert in houston but i had to work.
1,"Not Hard, Not Funky, Not Good","I happened to listen to a copy of Significant Other recently. It was wholly laughable. I thought they were bad before, but now they have sunk to a new low. I saw them on MTV recently claiming that they had ""matured."" HA! Their songs are still common aggro-rock, And Fred has no lyrical skill whatsoever. He raps like a 13 year old kid at a school talent show. Hamfisted guitar work, and beats that I've heard on a dozen other albums. I don't care what they say, they have no sense of expanding melody. And a quick word of advice to DJ Lethal, and the rest of the band. Scratching the band's name and Method Man's name is not clever. It makes you look like the self-praising, attention-grubbing fad followers you are. To All The Limp Bizkit Fans: Keep It REAL!!!!"
2,OK,"This CD is not even comparable to there first release. It does have some good songs, but this type of music is not exactly what I was looking for from limp bizkit. I hope they do better next time."
1,Worst of the Worst,"Warning: to people who appreciate good music, do NOT waste your time with this piece of... Everything with the cd is just so horrible, I only listened to it because everybody was saying how great they are. Fred Durst is one of the worst singers I have ever heard. This band is so incredibly horrible, I did not like one song on here. They are an un original rap-rock band,... With all the buzz I was hearing I expected something more, but I was dreadfully wrong, and you do not want to listen to this horrible cd. It is not even worthy of getting one star in its review, but it's required. It should be zero stars. Out of all the bad music that is surfacing and supposedly ""great,"" this is by far the worst of the pop-rock bands out."
3,Top-Selling CD of 99,"Limp Bizkit successfully pulls of a rap/rock mix with Fred Durst's vocals and DJ Lethal's mixing combined with the guitars, bass and drums of Wes Borland, Mark Rivers and John Otto (who is awesome, by the way). Unfortunately, the majority of the songs on this CD do not stick in my mind as outstanding. Best tracks: Nookie and Break Stuff."
2,THis Cd does not compare to the first one,"Limp bizkit screw it up big time their only like 5 cool tracks, the others are like rap and i hate that s%$t. Now we have to wait 3 years for the other one."
2,"Eminem is supposed to be on this, I'm ticked-off.","I purchased this cd thinking my boy Slim Shady does a song on it and I have yet to find it, I'm pretty ticked about that, but the cd is pretty cool still."
3,okey-dokey,"Hmm. I dunno. `Nookie' and `Break Stuff' are great but I've been listening to the rest of the album for some time and its failing to hit me g-spot. Limp Bizkit don't seem to have a style set in concrete, they vary - which is fine but the whole hip-hop and rap element to a lot of their stuff makes my interest pretty shortlived. But then if thats what turns you on its for you, metal with elements of other genres. Damn good idea - but for me a bit of raging Machine Head puts me more in the mood."
1,Keep HipHop Pure definitely!,"Limp Bizkit is okay on rapping but I know that DJ Primo laced the wax perfectly for the track N 2gether now which is definitely the best sounding track on the whole album. I would recommend just getting this track only and rest of it is mediocre because I don't think that the metal element ought to belong in the rap game, ya'll know. Keep hiphop pure!"
1,....wow...,"I must say, I didn't enjoy listening to this album at all. I rememberd hearing Break stuff from a friend and enjoying it, so i went, wut the hell and tried this album out.....and did i ever regret it.I heard this band was a huge band in europe, and I honestly thought that these nations over seas didnt have very good music. Yeah, this album is just that brokenSereously, dont buy this album. Its a waste."
1,"lamest, fakest, worst music in decades...","this is the problem with most of today's music, namely the bands who try to mix rap & rock: they are people from states like florida and nebraska, using lyrics which make them sound ""bad"" like they're from new york or LA. they end up tricking a lot of people by being posers, and those people become fans. limp bizkit has no talent: they don't write good songs, they can't play good guitar riffs, and fred durst can't sing. and you can figure out what kind of people listen to this garbage (the people who spell everything wrong in their reviews, even the band's name; girls who use the excuse ""fred durst is soooooo hot"") i don't like anything like limp bizkit or korn or kid rock, nor do i listen to the backstreet boys or anything like that. the truth is, the rock 'n roll genre is on a landslide, and the only good music came from before the mtv generation, and before all the bands were selling out to it."
2,No-talent album,"I do not automatically dislike any music classified as ""rap-metal,"" but like any genre of music, there are good bands and there are not-so-good bands. LB tries to play music that is both rap and metal, but their music fails to sound good in either genre. The guitar riffs are some of the worst in the genre, and the singing is not true ""rapping"" either. The good production, synthesizers, & ""scratching"" (what a gimmmick!) cannot disguise the essential lack of talent. Other ""rap-metal"" type bands, notably Korn, Slipknot, & Run-DMC (I love their song ""Raising Hell"") are far better than this. (The songs from LB's debut album that I've heard are considerably better, but still not great, btw.) The reason that this gets 2 stars instead of 1 is because the band plays their own music unlike you-know-who. If they improve their songwriting & guitar playing skills, they could record a good album, but this one shows that they are not skilled enough yet."
1,Just a teeny bopper fad,"Their first album was ok and showed some potential. But then they decided to kiss up to MTV and become rock's version of N'SYNC. On this album, you can tell that Fred Durst and buddies are very limited musically, all you hear is crap mixed with very weak rock. The reason why these guys are popular is because they write safe, conforming, uncreative songs that appeal to MTV's mindless teenybopper audience. The only good thing about this band is that they won't be around when the crap-rock fad dies in a few years.If you like c-rap then, you might like this album, but if you like real rock or metal, then stay away from this."
3,Um.......don't know what to say..........,"Overall I rate this CD as OK, BUT COULD BE BETTER. Limp has a lot of talent, but I feel some of it was wasted on this CD. A few songs are excellent, another few are just good, and a couple suck. It is worth buying for those few excellent songs though!"
5,"The Limp B-I-Z-K-I-T make a ""Significant"" new record","This is the CD of the summer, possibly of the year. Gone is the more agonized sound of Bizkit from Three Dollar Bill, Yall$ with a new organized rap-metal sound. In some ways, you might miss the screaming, but Fred Durst's new style will have you hooked. This CD includes songs with Method Man and DJ Premier, of GangStarr, (n 2gether now) and Scott Wylen (from STP) and Jonathon Davis (KORN) both on No One Like You. The best tracks would have to be #2, Just Like This, and probably #9, nineteen 90nine, where Fred Durst showcases his MC skills. Also, if you ever have a chance to see Limp Bizkit in concert, pay whatever the price is, because it's worth it. I saw Bizkit, Kid Rock, and Staind in St. Paul on the Limptropolis tour and it was the most fun I've ever had. 5 stars for the CD and 10 for the concerts. You won't regret buying this CD."
2,What does cookie mean??? Dick???,"Hmmmmm....can you say over-produced trash for trendies and pop-culture sponges coming from a fake band with not much musical talent aimed at stupid teenagers and you know something's wrong when in the reviews for BSB it is littered with ""Nookie is my favorite song."" Before I begin sounding like a 50 year old man, let me tell you I'm a 14 y/o girl. (Just wanted to clear that up.)Um, nevermind. (Nevermind is a great album.) Want rap-metal??? Get Rage Against the Machine. If you are a teenybopper, go buy this album along with Hanson's Middle of Nowhere.Oh, and I give it two stars because I hate watching a band sell-out. In otherwords, I'm being sympathetic."
2,Dribble glass,"If you're looking for a *replacement* carafe and already own the coffee-maker then you probably already know this, but in case you don't then be aware that this model has a ""dribble"" problem.Especially when the carafe is full, the coffee tends to overflow either side of the spout and run down the side of the carafe onto the table/counter/floor/etc.The carafe looks nice, but too much consideration was given to aesthetics and not enough to functionality."
3,Good Carafe,"The carafe pot was decent, but the black removable top does not fit on it. It's loose and comes off very easily unless your hand is holding it down at all times. Slight inconvenience but other than that not too bad!"
2,Lid Falls Off,"Seeing we had broken our previous carafe, it was nice to have another one. But there are two plastic notches on the back of the lid that hold it in place. One was broken and causes the lid to fall off when you are pouring. Shipment was quick."
5,Moore Quality Television,"What good news! The Mary Tyler Moore show was one of the highest quality sitcoms produced during the past 34 years, and it has astonished me that it has taken so long for these shows (barring Season 1) to be released on DVD. With all of the absolute junk out there being released (I guess it's a matter of taste, which doesn't speak too highly of our culture :-)), I simply can't believe all of the MTM seasons aren't out yet. Both Seasons 1 and 2 contain such good material, and Season 3 promises to be just as enjoyable. If you like The MTM Show, buy all three seasons (great discounts on Seasons 1 & 2 at Amazon). Let's get Season 4 out before too long!"
4,Not the Mary Tyler Moore I Remember from my Childhood,"My sisters and I grew up watching MTM and admiring her for all her beautiful clothes and handsome boyfriends so I was thrilled to receive these DVDs of Season 3 for Christmas. What surprised me is that as an adult I have a whole different perception of Mary. Yes, the program was extremely funny and the cast was outstanding, but I found that Mary was not the independent, confident heroine that I remembered. Instead she's mostly insecure and unable to stand up for herself and DEATHLY afraid of commitment. That definitely took some of the fun out of watching these old favorites."
5,Transaction could not have been better!,This transaction could not have gone better. I received the product in the condition described and much faster than promised.
3,SOPHOMORE SLUMP,"In its second season, THE PRETENDER suffered from an overabundance of all the things that were fresh in the first season that became redundant and tedious the second time around. Jarod's predilection to obsess on new things, like chocolate milk, twinkies, etc. didn't seem as fun as before; Miss Parker's attempts to be sympathetic died when she returned to her former cool demeanor, although she has some great lines; Broots' nerdiness is now annoying; Mr. Raines the Nosferatu like villain and newcomers Mr. Lyle and Brigitte cartoonish villains; and the show just doesn't want to get rid of them, even though they've worn out their welcome. Jarod's angelic stature is also getting monotonous. But in spite of all this, the show still remains kind of addictive; we want to know where Jarod's family is and who killed Miss Parker's mother, and it does end with an explosive cliffhanger. Just wish they'd try to branch out a little more."
1,Good advice,"I am so glad I read the review with 1 star. Having been uncoordinated all my life, I have trouble with 2 sided discs. Thank you for saving me money. Have a healthy life."
5,The Pretender - The Complete Second Season,"""a very good series, It is ashame that they didn't continue the series further"". I have seen all four seasons and the two movies and thoroughly enjoyed them"
4,Enter Mr. Lyle,"Though the show takes a bit of a darker tone this season with the addition of Mr. Lyle (played by James Denton of ""Desperate Housewives""), the mystery of Jared's and Miss Parker's pasts will keep you interested. The season finale ""Bloodlines"" is one of the best season finales I've ever seen and features an appearance by Hayley Joel Osment.If all you've seen is the newer made-for-cable movies (the second of which was not very well done), you need to check out this season."
4,Good stuff,"We enjoyed The Pretender very much when it was on the air, and we were disappointed when it was cancelled. It's nice to have access to the show via DVD recordings. Jarod is a real ""good guy"" and goes around helping other people while carrying out his quest to find his family, all the while evading thugs from The Centre.This is a good show for depicting good versus evil, and overall, it's a decent family program. There are a few 'adult situations' but those will often go over the heads of younger children. For the most part, the whole Pretender series is fun, exciting, often humorous, and gratifying. Each episode has elements of redemption. Good is vindicated, and the bad guys get justice. Two thumbs up!"
1,Bulb is not replaceable,"I had this lantern for over 5 years. Used mainly for camping. The unit is great and durable. BUT now that the bulb is burnt, I disassembled the unit to get to the bulb. The bulb attached by wire to the battery unit. I research replacement bulbs and guess what - there is no replacement. Now this unit will go into the trash and fill the land field. How sad when the problem could be resolved by buying another build. Don't waste you're hard money on this unit. BAD CALL GE!"
3,Great until non-replacable bulb burns out,"This lantern is fantastic in almost every way. Bright and efficient. Doesn't hurt to look directly at it. Handle converts into a hook for hanging. Works well with D batteries or AA Eneloops in D-cell adapters. Used it many times camping on the picnic table, in the tent, and hanging from the camp kitchen light pole. Also used for many power outages at home.But it's one fatal flaw is that the bulb is not replaceable. My lamp is now headed for the landfill. In fact, since I cannot figure out how to open it (it must be glued?), the toxic CFL bulb in going in the landfill with it."
2,Not exactly an emergency light,"This can be described as a glorified flashlight. Emergency lights come on automatically when the power goes off. With this product, you need to switch it on as it is powered by 4 D-batteries. Not to mentioned the batteries are not included, so you are looking at buying batteries and keeping them handy when the power goes off. The latern looks nice - has a classic look. For me or if you are aged, for example, you don't want to go search for this light when you have no power, I would like the place around me light up so I can be safe. If you are going camping, then you might find the product claimed 18 hour battery life useful. I returned the product."
4,Weber 9985 Grill cover for Genesis E310/320 grill,Nice looking cover. Fits grill perfectly. Seems to be of good quality. We'll see what the winters in Pa. do to it now.
3,"Unsure about design, so I returned it","Like so many others, I instinctively bought the 7553 cover thinking it was exactly what I needed to protect my new Genesis S-310. After seeing the envelope-sized vents above the side trays (and the gas controls), I was skeptical. I don't want to criticize Weber yet about this design without having some long-term evidence, but I'm not willing to take any chances with water standing on my grill. So I took this back and fortunately found the 9985 cover at my local True Value for $60. The 9985 has an the elongated vent along the backside of the grill box. This seems to be a better design. Hopefully I made the right choice."
2,Side vents - poor design,"Purchased this cover without reading the other very helpful reviews!I assumed that the cover would protect my brand new Genesis from all elements. It doesn't :-( I live in Ireland and the main reason for covering the bbq is to keep it dry. The vents at the side mean that both side tables accumulate water and it pools around the right-hand side controls. I have had to resort to using my old generic bbq-cover which which isn't tall enough and the then put the Weber one over that to cover the lower parts. The description needs to be updated to say that it protects from falling leaves/bird droppings and that it is not dustproof showerproof, rainproof, snowproof or hailproof.Wish I had read the other reviews prior to purchasing."
2,Studying Joseki will make you 2 Stones weaker,"As a beginning Go player, you always seem to get the short end of the stick in the corners - a very compelling reason to buy this book, but be warned that you will only learn enough to get into trouble. Eventually you will need to get the classic (but slightly dated) 3 volume ""Dictionary of Basic Joseki"". 38 Basic Joseki is decent for the beginning go player on a budget who need to get an idea what joseki is all about, but it tells you too little. As you progress through the ranks, it will collect dust on the shelf, something which ""Dictionary of Basic Joseki"" will never do."
1,ESPN Fast Action Football,The system stopped working correctly within days of powering it on. There are lights that no longer turn on. Not worth the money I spent on it.
3,If You Own The 1st - Add this to the set!,"Granted, its not as classically fun as the originally, but it still is worth having in your collection. The random stars in this movie make it worth it also. Linda Blair is HOT in this movie, and Lyle Alzado makes for an extra side to this sequel.""First comes the women,then the whiskey"""
1,LAME!,"Zapped which is the original movie isn't the best movie ever made but it had a charm to it and is worth at least 3 stars but Zapped Again the sequel is lame, lame lame!"
4,"Daniel Green Women's Teresa Washable Slipper,Pink,9.5 W","I have a high instep and the slippers are very hard to get on. Once on, they are very comfortable."
3,Daniel Green Slipper White,"Daniel Green Slipper, White: Adorable little slipper, well made, warm and toasty, but beware: the sizing is off and the slipper is much smaller than it should be. I wear a size 7, ordered a size 8, and this was still too small so I returned it. The return process was relatively painless, and I was refunded my money quickly, but still..."
1,help?,I was about to buy one but not after hearing its not titanium? can anyone help me out with a reply if its a legitimate watch??
1,Coasters,"I ain't a mathematician, but all 5 discs being coasters isn't a good ratio. Just stick with better brands like verbatim."
5,Loomis keeps you involved.,"The Julian Secret is an incredible blend of facts and story telling. I could not put the book down. As a father of three, I am constantly involved in ""kid madness"". The day I picked up this book became ""family reading/book day"". Details you can smell and touch. This book keeps your attention and takes you on a great journey."
2,"For DSi, not DS","Not sure whether they screwed up the description here, or the shipping, but the kit we received was for a DSi not a DS - so the charger and the docking station weren't functional for a DS."
5,Great Book for beginners!,"This is a really good for a beginner to learn SQL using Oracle. The authors have very clearly explained the complicated terms and concepts, in a fashion we are used to learn in class rooms.It can also be used as a reference book or as a quick refresher course for someone who have not used SQL in a few years or so.I strongly recommend this book to everyone interested to learn SQL using Oracle."
1,This book is outdated,"i bought this book to learn SQL two year ago. The SQL table that comes with the book was meant for Oracle 8 and when i started learning SQL the version was 9 , so this book did not serve any purpose to me."
3,"A bit flimsy, color runs","They are somewhat flimsy, the waffle weave catches on things easily. Also the color runs a LOT. Even after using them to wash several things they still bleed color."
1,"Oh Dear, God!!","This poor excuse for entertainment was recently released here in the UK on dvd.A really bad pilot for a tv show that I hope is cancelled before it gets started.I can only guess that Mel Gibson and Jet Li, who both have production credits, are sitting in a corner somewhere, laughing their heads off at this monstrosity. Bad acting, terrible dialogue, and martial arts, that looks like it's been choreographed by Kevin Smith,(you know what I mean).Billy Zane plays it for laughs, but certainly dosen't escape unscathed from this mess."
1,Painful,"I cannot say enough bad things about this movie. I thought the fact that Billy Zane was the main character would be enough to make it a good movie. If I had any doubts then, they were put down by the words at the top of the case: ""Produced by Jet Li and Mel Gibson."" How can it be a bad movie? THEY FOUND A WAY! This just goes to prove that you can't judge a book by its cover. I never liked the Power Rangers. Why would grown men, all of whom are famous actors, want their names associated with a movie like this?"
1,"too much obscure, needless information","I just took the clep test for engl. lit and Amer. lit. It was much easier than I expected, and I vastly overstudied, due in part to being psyched out by these study guides. I thought I needed to know every silly little obscure thing they covered . To prepare for these tests, I'd recommend instead that you buy the Barron's easy key (about 6 bucks), then look over the list of books covered by either Cliff notes or Barron's book notes ( Barron's is better written) and make a list of the titles they list. Now, armed with that list of commonly assigned books, go to your library and look at the ""Magill"" masterplots, for an excellent 2-3 page synopsis and critque of these titles. You will save alot of time and money this way -- Zero in on the pertinent stuff and don't get thrown by Rudman's --"
2,Hollywood Crap!,"Hello... Does anyone get the advertising here? I felt like I was being blasted by commercials. How much did EBay pay for advertising on this movie? The whole movie is filled with commercials for everything from electronics to movies and even a television show clip? They had no clue what to do with the character, one minute he's pure and childlike and the next he is smoking weed, getting drunk and calling women ho's? This movie has no heart and tries way to hard to make imature, lazy, dope smoking, drunks who abuse women funny. What is up with 4and 5 stars on this one?"
2,"Too much, too little, too late to fall...","This movie stunk up the room more than my rear-emissions following a heavy Mexican meal. Steven Carell is a funny and handsome man, and in shows like ""The Office"" or ""Bruce Almighty"" he is just the ticket to wash those ""break-up"" blues away (something I've been enduring more than my share of lately). But I don't know why dumb moviegoers flocked to see him in this tasteless consolation prize grab-bag. Don't get me wrong, I like weird, sick comedies as much as the next gal (check my reviews for proof). But this one made me feel like I was sacrificing my intelligence, and that's where I draw the line."
2,17 more minutes? Could have been 30 minutes less,"I cant remember why I got this film. I think I heard it was a funny movie and it got some good reviews so I got it. First off, comedy movies should never exceed the two hour mark. I really cant think of a comedy that lasted more then two hours, maybe some Amazon reader can help me out on that. I laughed only a few times during the whole film but it wasnt really long laughs. I heard the theater version is much better then this version which would make sense. The added 17 minutes puts it over two hours and most of the scenes could have been deleted. If this movie was about an hour and forty minutes, I probably would have enjoyed it more."
2,Just... Bad,"I really enjoyed the acting of actor Steve Carell in The Office, but this movie, the 40 Year Old Virgin, was just... bad. Crude, rude, ... bad acting, bad dialogue, terrible treatment of women...Steve Carell, I didn't know you were so hard up for money. Please don't do it again. Yes, there are some dramatic scenes, but they can't save the movie.I need to go now and wash my eyes..."
3,Not as Good as Wedding Crashers,"This film has its moments that will make you laugh out loud. I saw it shortly after the superior ""Wedding Crashers,"" however, and so I was a bit disappointed.As the film's title strongly implies, the film is about a 40 year old sales clerk who is still a virgin. When his co-workers find out, they try to get him laid. He finally meets the woman of his dreams but they decide to wait until twenty dates before they have sex. The movie kind of drags on, however, and most viewers will wish that they had decided to do it after only ten dates.The film is still an above average comedy that is worth watching."
3,good comedy,"good comedy a little much on the graphic language in the begining, not sure it needed it to be funny, but i guess they were going for shock value. if you like that, you will love the movie, really gets funny after the first 30 mins."
2,One of the most highly overrated movies of all time,"Have you ever seen a kid, typically five or six years of age, who has discovered that acting a certain way and doing certain things evokes a specific response from adults: ""Oh, isn't that funny and cute!"" And the kid plays up this behavior over and over and over again, to the point that it's no longer funny and cute, but excruciatingly obnoxious and irritating?That in a nutshell is ""40 Year-old Virgin"".The film takes a set of lines and situations which range from tired to moderately clever, and overplays them literally to death. Almost every scene is too long, the ad libbing is 95% needless and flat, and by the end of the first half-hour the ""Aw, gee, isn't Andy cute?"" mantra has worn a hole in your head the size of a dinner plate.Just for kicks I may buy a copy of ""40 Year-old Virgin"" and edit it down to a 9 or 10 minute short story. It would likely work a lot better."
2,J.W.,"SO THIS MOVIE CAME OUT IN 2005 .I NEVER RENTED ( I DID JUST PURCHASE IT OFF HERE AND FRANKLY CANT WAIT TO PASS IT ON) IT BUT ITS ALL I HEARD ABOUT AS IF IT WAS THE GREATEST COMEDY MOVIE EVER MADE...ALL I CAN SAY IS WHAT THE HECK WERE ALL THESE PEOPLE ON WHEN THEY WERE WATCHING THIS??? I LAUGHED MAYBE ONCE ,EVER OTHER WORD WAS THE F BOMB JUST STRAIGHT UP STUPID.IF YOU TRULY WANTTO SEE IT JUST RENT IT AT THE CHEAPEST PLACE YOU CAN FIND. NOT A GREAT COMEDY, NOT A GREAT MOVIE.I WILL SAY ITS GOOD TO WATCH STEVE CARELL NOW AND SEE HIM IN GOOD MOVIES WITH ACTUAL PLOTS."
4,Pretty good if you're a guy.,"Funny, guy-humor. Sometimes crude and witty at the same time. Waxing scene is classic. All in all, fun to watch."
3,Twisted Humor,This movie was cute in it's own way but not worth buying. You have to have somewhat of a twisted sense of humor to appreciate it. Don't waste your money rent it instead.
1,40 years before we had good movies!,"Is this the new talent from Hollywood? Where is the acting? Where is the story line? Where are the production values?We can only hope that Hollywood will be the next big disaster. I think it's funny when these people ""think"" they are stars. The day of the talented Hollywood is over. Don't waste your money on this trash. Go see a good foreign film. America doesn't have a clue."
1,Painful movie. I wish I skipped it.,"My boyfriend and I went to this movie we both hated it. It was really pathetic. Perhaps the fact that we actually know men who are engineers and physicsts who are like this is part of it. Yeah there are people who cannot interact with women or people. It is pathetic. I would feel sorry for anywoman dating this man or any man like this because they lack confidence and are so hard to deal with. Low self esteem. Do you want to see a pathetic portion of the population yeah this is them there are actually people like this. Perhaps it is funny, but just do not be around one of these people in reality. It is a painful reminder of how screwed up they are. Not all men are virgins like this man, but some might as well be because they have no clue about women. they do not know how to open a door or hold a hand."
3,2nding the notion that the unrated version pales in comparison to the original,"This is one of the funniest movies I've had the pleasure of catching at a movie theater in a long time. I thought I was purchasing more laughs for my buck buying the UNRATED version, but much to my disappointment this is definitely a case of MORE is LESS. The added scenes do nothing to enhance the original; in fact, I'd say 90% of these added scenes should have been left as ""deleted scenes."" They hurt the comedic pacing of the original. If you thoroughly enjoyed the original at the theaters, stay away from this unrated version. In fact, I'm so disappointed in this unrated version, I'm tempted to buy the r-rated ""original"" version even though it only comes in full screen (why the original is unavailable in the widescreen format is also cause for this fan to roll his eyes in disbelief)."
3,Inexperienced dork falls for over-experienced shrew,This is a horror film about a naive forty-year old who gets suckered into marrying a dried up old shrew who chews men up and spits them out.Stay single man!(It's also damn funny.)
3,Rated MUCH better than Unrated,"I loved this film in the theaters, I thought it was overwhelmingly funny. I saw it again, on DVD, with the extra footage, and after having hyped it to everyone around, me, I was sorely disappointed, and they thought I'd lost my taste in movies.The extra footage was cut from the movie on purpose. It ruins the pace of many of the jokes, some of it just isn't funny to begin with.Thankfully, they saw fit to release the theatrical version as well."
2,Juvenile and Vulgar,"I was severely disheartened to see my current favorite actress, Catherine Keener, involved in such a juvenile, vulgar and surprisingly unfunny movie. To her credit, it was mostly tolerable when she was on screen. I can only hope that she was not aware of how badly improvised this movie would be and accepted based on some other factor.This may appeal to 15-year-old virgins since they may find the quality of humor directly proportional to the amount of expletives used. I was merely annoyed and bored."
2,Crass and stupid movie.,"This movie was a complete disappointment. There were maybe two funny scenes. The rest was nothing but pathetic, offensive scenes full of swears. My husband could not even finish watching the movie because it was boring and a complete waste of time."
2,Forrest Gump for Nerds,"so I finally sat down&watched this film which has gotten so much hype.after watching it I felt like it was the Nappolian Dynimite for 05. every year there is that Underdog Movie that catches on&generates buzz.it's not so much the film is so great or good,but the Main Character seems to strike a chord.this film feels like a Music video with alot of the same formula of playing songs from the past to try to create a scene or something more which just ain't there.it had a few moments,but if this is the film that generated buzz at the Box office than the Hollywood film studios are in trouble.because this film will be done again&again&again."
4,Put It On A Pedestal...,"If you want a comedy, a real comedy that deals with a lot of the questions many face in their daily lives, than this is a movie for you!First of all, the entire cast is superb. Every character in this movie plays off of every other character so well, at times you may forget that you're watching a movie and feel like you're actively THERE with these guys! Second, the movie itself has a great message in the undertone; and that is that everyone is different and should live their life, with THEIR own goals and dreams.This movie also has some of the best one-liners to come out in a long time, and led by the master of improv comedy in Steve Carell, with great supporting cast members; this movie will have you laughing out loud the entire time!Classic movie, I watch it everyitme it's on tv even though I own the DVD becuase its just...that...funny!!! Put it on a pedestal, you won't regret it!"
1,Sad humor,"I gave it one star for the song he sang at the end of the movie. That was funny. I rented this movie after all the hype from the reviews on TV. I took it back (the long version) to the store because it was disgusting. I was told the long version was ""over the top"". Well the regular version was just as bad. Why we have to laugh at this kind of humor is just beyond me. I guess there are alot of people out there (just like the men in this movie) who are so bored with their lives that they have to laugh at this type of humor.It could have been a clever movie if they had cut the porn and sick humor. It was nothing more than a glorified porn movie. Call it what it is."
4,"Chuck the Unrated version in the trash, this one is the right one","I saw this movie in the theater originally, and had nothing but a great time watching it. It was a truly great comedy. Then I saw the Unrated version, and was very disappointed. The additional 17 minutes or whatever of footage was sometimes funny, but ultimately destroyed the movie's pacing and beauty. It trashed it up a little bit too much, where the theatrical version had enough heart to redeem itself as a complete film. This version, the original theatrical version, is the one you want to see. Don't buy the other one."
4,Probably better shorter,"""40 yr old Virgin"" is a romantic comedy/buddy movie, that exposes male behavior at its best--and worst. We saw the long version, and I suspect that a lot of the silly grossness that seemed to go on too long came from the added material. BUT--the scene where the ""big day"" finally arrives for Andy is as true a picture of male ambivalence as I've seen in a long time. It was worth it for that!"
4,Loveable Geek Paves the Way for a New Kind of Man,"The 40-Year-Old Virgin is literally that. Additionally, he is beset by the usual symptoms of arrested development--an addiction to computer games, toy figurines wrapped in original boxes to maximize their value, arcane knowledge of magic, Star Trek etc. But he is not a creep. Rather, he has a romantic at heart and is waiting for a woman who, unlike the fast-paced vulgarians around him, is worthy of his affections. Until that woman comes, the Virgin is bullied by his co-workers into losing his virginity. They give him all sorts of predictable advice and here the film works as a parody of hyper-masculinity. While a lot of gags are familiar, Steve Carell has exceptional comedic skill and he wins you over so that even though you know you're watching an adolescent farce, you still root for Correll to find his true love."
2,Slapstick at best,"Ok, ok, so everyone loves Steve Carell. I like him too, but I think this movie was more slapstick than a really great comedy. All the funny parts were in the previews with an all to obvious storyline, and slow painful attempts at humor sometimes. I guess I just need something a little more quality. I'm all for a laugh and a good time, but tired joked, and boob and penis humor are played out."
1,Not What People Say...,"This movie was not funny at all. I have read alot of reviews from people saying it was soooo great and hilarious. So, I made my mother buy it for me for Chirstmas. I wish she could have gotten her money back. This movie is over-rated to be something it's not. There were a few funny parts in the film, and I do mean a few. The rest of the movie was boring and too long. I don't like movies that take too long to get to the point. Steve Carell had a few moments, but that was it. The chest hair waxing part of the movie wasn't funny at all. I actually almost went to sleep on it. This movie is a great disappointment. It could have been alot better. Don't buy this...it's a waste of money."
2,Only plus is it's cheap!,Maximum volume is insufficient for speaker phone which will only operate when handset is in place covering speaker. Neither party can hear very well on speaker phone. Would not buy again or recommend.
2,John Deere should re-make toy more functional for a child,"I bought a similiar John Deere ""Gator 4X2"" yesterday at Walmart.Fist thing I noticed was the wheels do not turn when steering. You can not even turn a corner.My son has hurt his feet on the edges/sides when trying to push and he just ran into the door and hurt his inner thigh on the yellow knob.A horn and a seat that lifts up for hidden storage would be nice also and maybe some headlights that actually light up. As far as size goes it is a little small for my 2 1/2 year old.This vehicle needs a total re-evaluation from John Deere and I think it should be re-called.We will be returning John Deere today, even though it has already been used, but moslty due to my child being hurt.I will also be contacting John Deere to file a complaint."
1,It didn't work,"I followed this routine presicely as this book instructs for nearly three months. In that time I made huge gains in static strength in most of the exercises. I then went back to see how much my strength had increased with normal lifting technique. My strength had decreased as if I had done no lifting in that time. In addition, I gained no muscle. I wonder if these other reviews were simply written by the authors to help them sell books. It seems odd that these two non-physiolygist guys would discover something that qulaified researchers hadn't. The book contradicts many common assumptions about nutrition and lifting. I tried to ask them a question at their web site, but they wouldn't write back. Bottom line: it didn't work. I think these guys may be con-artists."
1,NOTHING BUT A HYPE.....,"after reading this book,i can't believe what the author is recommending about the training program. no matter how i think about the training there no way you will get big with this kind of training..ofcourse you will add weight with the program co'z your not doing a full range motion. but the truth is, you will loose a lot of strenght once you go back to regular training.. you guys outthere giving this book a 5 star think about this, if this training is so effective how come Mr. yates did not discover this when he was looking to change his training instead he looked up to Mike Mentzer for solution...i'm returning this book after i read the dorian yates book the warrior and watch the blood and guts video it's worth to keep , you might as well invest in this book and video than waist your time reading this book... it'not worth.GO BUY THE MIKE MENTZER BOOK HEAVY DUTY 1&2 OR BLOOD GUTS VIDEO OF DORIAN YATES...."
1,"Black streaks ended up in the ground product, even the finest setting does not produce powder","I ended up returning this product because even after 4 cups of grains that I put through it the flour had streaks of black which smelled like motor oil.I tried making superfine flour, but it came out coarse (like store bought whole wheat flour, not whole wheat pastry flour) even after running the same batch through twice. So if your goal is super fine flour, this mill might not be for you."
2,blendtec - the kitchen mill: Disappointing product,"The mill works to some extent, but it is by far not what you would expect a commercial product to be:- rather slow- so slow that the machine gets hot enough you have to stop it (just making a single bread...)- almost comically cumbersome emptying- sprays flour if not closed very carefully- variation of milling granularity does not work"
1,waste of money,"this book doesn't give you any background or theory on how to create a terrain engine. insted it only shows you code, code and more code!The little theory presented here seems to be the one in DirectX SDK documentation and it only uses of D3DX functions...Well... don't buy it!"
2,Good book but fairly old,"Although the 3D demo is quite ugly, the ideas inside are pretty interesting. The most interesting part is the engine development, which turns out really useful and its encapsulation allows you to improve your terrain optimization algorithm very easily."
5,A solid performance,"I know Callas' Norma has always been highly acclaimed. I do not deny that Callas is magnificent in this recording (watch out: recorded live! The sound is passable, but do not expect it to be flawless). Yet, there is no Norma like Monserrat Cabelle."
1,Right tool?,Not sure if this is the correct tool. Tried to remove my Ford Escape radio with these and I still haven't been able to get it out of the dash.
3,Works but...,"There are better ones out there. It toke me a few tries, but after applying a fair amount of pressure i was able to get the radio out."
5,Funny!,"Purchased as a gift and it went over quite well. Very funny and easy to read. Make you laugh out loud and say ""did someone really complain about that?"" Great pick me up when the stresses of life are too much."
2,Disappointed,"This is an out right lie. This is not 'imported German chocolate'. Once you buy the product and read where it's made, it says ""Made in POLAND"". ""Kinder"" is a German chocolate but if it is not made there, the chocolate is worthless. It is the milk and the coccao from Switzerland, France, Belgium & Germany that makes their chocolates the finest in the world.Be honest to your customers. Say it's made in Poland.Buyer beware. Also if you're looking at the ""MILKA"" chocolates.They claim it's from Switzerland....a lie again. It's Polish junk. It tasted like wax. If I want wax tasting chocolate....I'll go and buy the much cheeper and domestic Hershey's. Chocolate lovers...go buy LINDT. It's truly excellent, and made in Switzerland."
2,Soul Mate,"This book is written with Biblical principals from a Christian perspective and the author's own personal experience. It works if you're committed to abstinence, but it isn't a book for someone who is interested in being intimate before marriage. A lot of her advice is standard common sense, but the admonition of this book is to be celibate. It reminds me of a book that tries to cure you of an addiction."
4,Fuji S6000 is still a good one.,I am pleased with my used Fuji S6000 purchased Oct 2011. It's an oldy buy goody.Strengths:-good image quality.-unusually good high ISO shots for a compactWeakness:-xD cards-not as small as today's compacts
5,Easy Choice,"No regrets, here were my criteria- 10+ zoom- fast response- manual zoom (tired of flimsy and inaccurate zoom buttons)- AA batteries (no more proprietary batteries that die after a year)- good indoor shots (where many cameras fail)- less than $350The only other camera that I considered was the Panasonic FZ30. It has image stabilization, greater zoom, and is faster but uses proprietary batteries and from what I've read, already starts suffering from noise at ISO 80.With image stabilization this would be a perfect camera. For now I am completely satisfied with high light sensitivity and RAW mode shooting."
1,How dare she record Norma?,An insult to the art of bel canto!!! THE ugliest voice I've eve heard. And I'm an opera singer!!!
4,The handbook for Hawaii Kayakers. A must read before you go,"This is an update of her popular First Edition. As part of a group of long time kayakers in Hawaii, we always read what Audrey Sutherland has to say about a route before undertaking extended kayak trips along the coasts and between the islands of Hawaii. Her hints on preparation are always a good review on what to take and prepare for on a trip. This book is a good companion to her Paddling My Own Canoe which never ceases to inspire one to take a chance to experience the beauty and wildness of Hawaii's shores."
4,River Dawn,I listen to this cd almost every day to wind down. It's very soothing and relaxing. Its various passages repeat yet it's never boring... I work in a pretty hectic and fast paced environment and this music allows me to quickly change pace and concentrate on the things that are important.
3,River Dawn: Piano Meditations,Delightful arrangement. Soothing music for massage. Volume of this copy very poor. I must turn my CD volume control high in order to hear it.
2,Better than Dracula 3000,"Dracula 2 Ascension although not breaking any new ground is an entertaining enough vampire flick.Jason Scott Lee played a cool enough vampire hunter, but his character just doesn't make any sense, are we supposed to believe that he just happens to show up at the tail end of events from ""Dracula 1""?And please, no human being alive no matter what the reason or rationale would attempt to revive what they believe to be a ""dead"" vampire. Yeah sure, dropping the crispy count into the vat of blood was a good idea, but really, you don't try to revive a vampire under any circumstances, sorry, but that's just not credible."
2,CHANGED DISK,I own the DVD and when the Blue Ray became available I ordered. I was surprised because the documentary portion is totally eliminated and much of the music was also left out. I do not understand why the change but the dvd is better!
2,don't live up to the name,"The first time I wore the socks I got a nice blister within 5 miles, and had to end my hike early. I like the sock in general for the gym or whatever... but they didn't prevent any blisters..."
1,To Dream Again,Very disappointing. Was eager to read this book after reading and thoroughly enjoying Conor s Way. Loved character Nathional and story line had a lot of `promise. but female lead spoiled it all.. am unable to articulate what Nathanial saw in her. ugh! Could not read every page. Would not recommend.B. Boyle
3,"Quick read, great interviews, but not comprehensive enough","A capable and often engaging account of the Toronto Raptors. The subtitle -- Inside the Toronto Raptors' First Season -- is misleading. Jack Batten discusses the team from before they were even created until the end of their second season. The most interesting stuff in the book lies in the discussion of schmoozing with David Stern and the other NBA bigwigs in trying to lure the NBA to Toronto. Batten covers the usual expansion woes -- bad players doing bad things -- with flair. He interviewed all of the key people involved.The drawbacks of this book are many: no index, no stats, only eight pages of photos (and black-and-white ones at that), and the ending just hangs out there, with the drafting of Marcus Camby. The book tries to be a little too much, and ends up being a little less."
3,Political and Emotional Passion,"Not my invention for a title, but grabbed from the jacket. Fallaci's book is all and everything that reviewers have claimed for it, and it's been such a widespread read that it probably doesn't deserve my bleatings. But. No one seems to mention how this breathless pursuit of Alexander Panagoulis's trappings is a rather over-blown and over-written account. If you like the relentless, detail-swollen sort of thing, replete with repetitive outcries, then the drama of it all will carry you through to the end. Inspite of admiring the courage of this man and what he stood for, I found myself wilting by about the 300th page, and shamefully wished to be rid of him. This rhetorical style of writing is unlikely to send me in search of other writing by the author."
5,A Real Workhorse,My dad has let me borrow this unit several times. It is a real time saver and a real workhorse. It is very lightweight but has a lot of power. It gets the job done. Very dependable and convenient to use.
3,trimmer fine but battery not up to snuff,The trimmer is fine but obviously the battery wasn't up to snuff. I charged it as instructed before using but it still runs the unit slower than my old exactly same model. Such is life.
1,Where's the 3-D?,"The 3-D was so bad that you couldn't even tell it was filmed in 3-D. All attempts at using 3-D were blurry and out of convergence, so no perception of depth whatsoever. I am a 3-D afficiondo, so I know how to set up the TV for it. The movies were useless, the story horrible, and the humor unfunny. Almost no nudity despite supposedly being a ""softcore porn"" flick. This was the worst waste of money that I have ever experienced."
2,M The 3D Movie/ Playmates,i just got it and looked at it with my new hard plasic 3d red blue glasses upside down the problem is on lolipop that the story is stupid and the 3D is uneven the soft version of joey silvera scene and cut john holmes sceneand a few gags do pop out but other scenes are just tolerable in play mates a phoney documentary about swingers and about a prudish sexologist whose still a virgin ms jane kinsey the story more fair but 3d is also uneven some scenes arnt shot in 3d the day dream seqeunces except for the camelot one the ending wasnt shot at a good angle and tv cue cards were flat too unpurposely but a few 3dshots make it tolerable the only saving grace of these features if something wierd video would only release the hard core versions the 3d uneveness andstupid story would not be a bother much since the sex would throw it off
5,good & live,"I love this album. Saw the ""Plugged"" show when it first aired, liked alot of the tunes that MTV nor radio would normally play.... ""Living Proof"" really kicks me in the gut every time I hear it, and the very riled-up version of ""Light of Day"" makes me laugh."
2,CAUTION,"My Daughter loved this toy as an infant and would continue to enjoy it but I had to take it away. As her fingers got just a little bigger (around 14 months), they get stuck under the lions mane. If you buy this for your infant, be sure to take it away before the fingers can get stuck."
4,Excellent Bottle Carrier!,"Well built, quality materials, and very attractive look. The bottle opener is a bit cheap but I wasn't buying the case for the bottle opener."
3,The Greatest American Hero - Season Three,"What a blast from the past, found this series rather good at the time I first saw it in the 80's as I grew up, watching it this time I found it to be rather disapointing due to the level of voilence, and shooting that was in it, Another example for what the times were like in the 80's"
4,Good set for those who loved the show.,"I loved this show when it was first on, and it's still good. Many of the social situations dealt with on the show are still very valid today. The video and audio is very good considering how old the tapes were when it was put on dvd. The lack of extras was a bit disappointing however, some interviews with the stars or guest stars reminiscing about their time on the show would've been nice.Please note: the episodes for season 3 are out of broadcast sequence in the 2005 dvd set, which threw me at first. One episode they were married, then the next they weren't. If you want to watch them in the same order in which they were originally broadcast you will be playing musical discs, but then the show's story progression makes a lot more sense. Still worth having in your dvd collection!"
4,Greatest American Hero Comeback,I loved this show back in the 80's and I was so glad when it was released on DVD. This was one of my all-time favorite TV Shows. The DVD is packed with up-to-date interviews with the stars of the show and gives insight into what they are doing now. I can't wait to get Season 2 and Season 3 on DVD.
5,lucky guy,a story about an average guy that finds a suit and becomes a superhero. this superhero is not from any comic company do not believe. full of great laughs. if you like superman then you may like this hero series.
3,Don't be Clueless!,"Sellin and Winters provide a concise overview of things you probably never think of that affect communication between people from different cultures. Their book is easily understood with clear examples and sensible suggestions. Though not a substitute for real life, the book does draw from the authors' extensive overseas experience and may save many a business person from costly clueless blundering."
4,good,"This book is a pain in the ass, but the disk it comes with can be quite useful to help you learn how to use the system."
4,excellent,"This is an excellent movie. Yes, as the reviewer below me stes, it is meant to be a spoof, and as such, it excels. I have not much to add, except that its brilliance is found in its ability to make us laugh and be scared at the same time. This film is artistically silly (which sounds outlandish, but that's the only way to put it) and effectively scary. You'll be smiling and shivering, what else could you want."
2,Very disappointed,These are some of my favorite actors and I love Old Time horror and I didn't think I could go wrong by ordering this video but I was wrong.
1,coloring book,I was disapointed when I looked at this book. The paper is nice but it has alot of weird pictures. I give it one because of the paper quality. It cost to much for what you get.
1,PURE JUNK,"Brand new. Took it out of the box. Inserted knife blades into handle. Plugged it in, started to slice a loaf of homemade bread, it stopped working during the 4th slice, and electrical smoke was coming from the inside of the handle. I'm disgusted. Absolute junk."
3,Expected better.,"This is a pleasant balsamic, but only that. It has a pronounced flavor profile that begins enjoyably enough, but becomes reminiscent of molasses or burnt caramel. I wonder at the methods used to create it's silkiness and body, especially given its youthful age. As another reviewer mentioned, it tastes cooked. It's a decent balsamic, there are simply better choices available for the price."
3,A bit slow in response,"I have a bluetooth headset and There is a lag between system and the headset when listening to songs. The lag increases with time, listening for 1 hr, there will be a lag around 5 secs. Good for short term data transfer I guess"
4,Works for me.,"I bought two of them. Both worked fine on my XP machines. Not sure why other customers are having driver issues, but driver issues are common with cheaper products so I cannot discount their troubles. Maybe lower SP? The mini CD does have some junkware that I avoided."
1,useless bluetooth usb stick,The software that comes with these units wont load on any of my XP machines. Latest software is expensive. Waste of money.
1,amazon instant video is a horrible service,"i have had more problems than pleasure with this service. it was fun and enjoyable at first. it no longer is. i am fast approaching having more errors pop up of different kinds when i try to play an instant video than having videos play. it is not fun, and it is not enjoyable. not only should i not have to suffer issue after issue for why amazon cannot deliver the content it promises, i should also not have to anticipate having to call customer support every time i want to watch a video"
3,"The Time Tunnel, Rendezvous with Yesterday","I purchased because I remembered watching this episode in my youth. I have always been fasinated with time travel and the story of the Titanic. It was fun to see it again. The special effects back in the 1960's are so lame now, but at the time I originally watched this TV show I thought it was pretty cool. I also thought it was funny they didn't take a bit more time to make it more historically accurate."
4,A TV SCIFI CLASSIC,I absolutely enjoyed this dvd set. The show hasn't been televised much since 1968 and now is the perfect way to view it! This show was a landmark for scifi television in it's time period of the late 60's. Excellent use of bright colors in it's filming and the transfer to dvd is crisp. I never really got into other Irwin Allen shows as much as The Time Tunnel. I rank it among one of my favorite 60's tv shows along other great shows like The Prisoner and UFO.
1,Thumbs Down,"I did not grow up watching Time Tunnel when it originally aired but wanted to see this series because I love time travel themed stories. The first episode (Titanic) was fun but every episode after that seemed like a carbon copy. Every episode follows the same pattern: duo lands somewhere in time (on the Titanic, at the Alamo) where a bad event is going to happen; they attempt to tell someone of the bad event so they can prevent it; that someone thinks they're crazy and locks them up; they finally get someone to believe them and escape; they are unable to stop the bad event from happening; they are then transported to a new period of time; repeat episode. After a few episodes it got pretty boring. Since I don't have the same nostalgia for it as probably most of the viewers buying this set I guess I didn't appreciate it as much. I wanted to like it but can't recommend it. If you've never seen the series I'd say rent it but hold off on buying it."
4,"Split season sets actually cost less, are no rip off","This is the model FOX followed for the last two seasons of LOST IN SPACE, splitting the seasons into two releases. At first I thought it was a ripoff, but when I compared what season one of LOST IN SPACE cost to the combined total of both parts of season two, the split sets actually cost less.FOX does this because many retailers won't carry high priced DVD sets. They do not do it to rip you off, as I previously thought."
5,Great Stuff,I remember watching this show as a kid. It was great fun. The stories were very entertaining.
5,See this one for James Darren,James Darren was the star of this Irwin Allen Classic. I used to call it the clip show. Allen would take footage from old films to match them up with the episode written. This saved production costs when he had a lot of movies to choose from. There are quite a few good guest stars from 60's Tv that have already been mentioned here...I also liked Lee Meriweather (Catwoman in Batman) as one of the stars in the Time Tunnel control room. Although her figure was well hidden by a white lab coat!
3,DVD blunder,I recieved 2 of the discs in the box that were episodes 9-17. When you get this item at a store...check for this error.
5,"The ""Time Tunnel"" holds up great, a must buy!","I watched the ""Time Tunnel"" when I was a kid, and was glued to it after just the first episode. The best thing is, watching them again on remastered DVDs is really like seeing them for the first time all over again! This show holds up well, there's some history in each episode, and it makes you wonder about what would happen if time travel were really possible, what choices would one make? Would we murder the infant Adolf Hitler? Would we get in the way of JFK's Dallas motorcade? Bottom line, these are truly great shows, and the ""Time Tunnel"" set is one of the best in the history of network TV - it's a must buy!"
4,Nice and sturdy,"These were from warehouse deals and on Amazon, showed removed for review. Not sure what the issue was but these look fine and are must sturdier than the thin clear plastic trays. I brought in from outside all the plants so they'll be protected from the winter weather and these will work great underneath some heavy pots."
2,very okay,"I appreciate what the guy is trying to do, it's just that he's not that funny. I don't have a lot of in depth criticism - his humor is just kind of dorky and average. He's very likeable, however. Like one of his jokes is:""What if horses could talk, but all they said was just stupid, like 'I can hear the radio!' and you'd be like, 'you're magic for this?! what a waste!""You'll probably finish listening to this CD with a feeling of ambivalence towards him."
1,Not very funny.,"Seventeen tracks -- but maybe three decent jokes, tops. Eugene Mirman is in the comedy business the same way a barnacle is in the overseas shipping business."
5,Blackberry Wine,My favorite book by her. I liked it better than Chocolat for some reason. Maybe it is because of the ending (don't want to say too much) and it also revisits some of the characters from Chocolat.
3,Fun read,"A fun read and I was sad when the book came to the end. I had grown fond of the characters (excluding Kerry, who I found utterly irritating) and wanted to know what came next. I could feel the main characters disappointment, his fears and loneliness. I enjoyed how the book balanced between the main characters childhood and adulthood, 1975 to 1999. It was wonderful to see the character develop throughout the story. And of course, there was Joe, the most colorful character of all. His presence throughout the book, even in spirit was truly charming. I certainly recommend this book and cannot understand why some people gave it only 1 or 2 stars. Perhaps because there is a certain level of predictability. I definitely plan to order more of Joanne Harris' books based of reading this one."
3,So Close,"If you were also delighted by Chocolat, you may be somewhat disappointed in Joanne Harris's latest. Parts of the book were incredibly imaginative and wonderful, but I found the last portion of the book disappointing. The ending seemed hasty, nothing like the well-crafted beggining. I especially found the situation at the end with Rosa, Kerry and the grandmother to be quite unbelievable and silly. It was a fun read and had all the potential of being spectacular, but I felt it came up short."
3,No sparkle in this wine...,"A bought this on a friend's recommendation and was excited about reading it. I hadn't read Harris' first book Chocolat, but I enjoyed the movie. When I feel asleep after reading the first few chapters, I knew I was in trouble. Harris mixes together two stories, one from the protagonist's childhood and one from his present. The chapters of story intersperse each other, one to one. For me, this had the effect of pulling me out of each story, just as I was becoming involved. I found that I wasn't concerned with the dilemmas of the novel (writing a second novel and reconciling his past), possibly because of the way the stories were constructed. I finished the book simply because stories nag at me when I don't finish them."
4,Quirky & Dark,"This is my favorite of the Joanne Harris books I've read. I read Chocolate; then Five Quarters of the Orange; then this book. I found all to be dark and quirky as they tell the tale of ordinary people whose lives are affected by exotic people or circumstances...in this case the most notable is the ""talking"" wine. This is a tale of the low places in life...places people don't want to be...places not to be recalled happily. We follow the main character, Jay, in his quirky childhood experiences and into his choice to uproot himself from a stagnate urban life without the hope for a future - it is almost just a different setting in which to be stagnant. Jay's dark life changes slowly with no great effort on his part as he becomes aware of a world outside of himself. On the ""dark & quirky"" scale - Five Quarters is off the chart; Chocolate is slightly more whimsical, though still very dark; and Blackberry Wine is more quirky than dark."
2,Disappointed,"I was looking for a decent set of backup headphones to use when my Bluetooth is on the charger. These had decent reviews, but I am very disappointed. They turned out to be identical in sound and quality to a $5.00 pair I bought at Walmart. They sound okay but not great."
3,"Okay at first, not that great afterwards","I bought these earphones around a year ago, I believe. They were great at first. The three sizes for the earbuds ensure that you have a proper, comfortable fit. The sound was much clearer than my previous earphones.A few months later, the sound got a bit fuzzier. Not by much, but you could hear it, especially when a track would go silent. Then, around two months ago, the left earphone just completely died out. And a few weeks after that, the right one fizzled out.They were good while they lasted, but alas, they don't have much of a lifespan. Also, the wires are made of a felt/cloth-like material, which makes it prone to clinging to things. They'll easily get tangled, or they'll cling to something so that when you move, they fall out.Other than that, they're okay. Better than some earphones, but I wouldn't say it's one of the best.[Why is it so hard to find a good, inexpensive pair of earphones? *sigh*]"
5,a lot of sound for the investment..,"I have been buying ear canal phones recently and unwilling to pay the big bucks, I have targeted phones in the sub $75 range. These diminutive little guys have a very good sound. The low end is tight and not at all exaggerated. The mids and highs are surprisingly smooth compared to the competition and I find myself able to listen for extended periods without fatigue. Sibilance is often times an issue with inexpensive phones but not with these. I have owned them for just a short time so cannot comment on their durability. They seem small and perhaps even fragile but quality of construct seems very good. The only thing I would have preferred is a more substantial cord. This is one of those small gauge limp numbers and tangling could be an issue. But for $24 folks, you can't go wrong. The previous negative comments regarding these phones are unwarranted. You can buy them with confidence."
2,Ear buds not a great concept?,"I was disappointed as these are only a little better than the ear buds that came with my iPod. None of the three sizes of foam ear pieces are all that comfortable or secure in my ears, and are only marginally better than the iPod version at noise-canceling. My $15 Sony MDR A-35 conventional style headset has much better tone, stereo separation, and comfort. Maybe ear buds are just not that great a concept. I could have spent a lot more on ear buds, but I see no reason to - I'll stick with my conventional Sonys."
4,Not a cliched religious experience.......,"Although she does seem to have a tendency to go off on a tangent, for me, this book confirms what I've known and felt for years - underrepresented in most organized religions and totally out-of-place in Christianity, period. After reading this book, I think I'm ready to 'come out' and tell family and friends what I've known for several years - I'm Pagan as the day is long and secure in my beliefs and religion!"
4,Durable and so much fun...Keeps kids active,"The item was just how it was described. It is very durable and I have a pretty rambunctious little girl who is very active and this toy did just that. I love the pink and purple colors that are so girly, but just as fun as any other glove and ball."
5,Become Bedazzled,"Wow, besides being a fun movie with a great cast and story, for anyone from Orange County California, think THE IRVINE FAMILY RANCH....It will give you a whole new story to think about. Would love to know if anyone else sees the similarities...."
5,Glad to have this,This will help me immensely when I need to shut down the toilets. My arm just does not turn to the left and behind the toilet. thanks for your product.
5,Sand Creek -- Characters!,"This book was similar to Tony Hillerman books, but even better! It is more contemporary, and very nicely written. I liked the comfortable chapter development, so that I could set it down, and yet still finish it in a few days. Linden really turns out some interesting ideas and phrases, and he uses intriguing imagery of the Southwest. Also, it is very culturally revealing - I mean, haven't you just wondered what modern rodeo cowboys might be like? Or how the Native American peoples might live today -- their personalities, their unique traditions? If you live in the southwest, and you know some cowboys and indigenous people, then can you imagine how these people interact? With cleverness and humor, by Lindens account! I'm not really much of a reader, but this book I just loved! I plan to read the continuing series, as it comes out, because the quality appears certain to me. It has what I like in a book --no wasted words, no repetition -- it was just right."
3,Not bad,Does not cool as well as I would have liked. The temperature is near 40 degrees celsius at idle. The fan protection plastic ring partly broke off in shipping and could not glue back on for some reason?I think there are better coolers out there but maybe not for this compact of size. The bracket holding the cooler to the processor base is attached only on the middle base piece and not on the other two available base pieces ; which I found not the best bracing system but is on there just not real tight fit.
3,Okay,"The lemon drops are not as I hoped for. These are not as tart as I like with lemon drops. The coating actually has a weird taste initially - then okay as it disolves in your mouth. I am keeping them, but would not buy them again. I was planning on getting the raspberry ones, but now I will not get this brand again."
4,Great Scholarly work on the God Incarnate,"Good scholarly work on the great saint and god incarnate Sri Sai Baba of Shirdi. This books dealt with the life and teachings of Sri Sai Baba of Shirdi from different angles - Hindu Mysticism, Dualism, Sufism, Chisti Brotherhoods etc. and provide great insights into the beliefs around the holy man. Considered as an incarnation in the Avadhuta tradition of Masters - Lord Dattatreya, Sri Sripada Srivallaba, Sri Narasimha Sarswathi, Sri Manik Prabhu Maharaj and Swami Samardha of Akkalkot, Sri Sai Baba of Shirdi is a living god for millions of Indians now who take care of their problems and show the path of deliverance from his holy tomb in Shirdi. Most of the literature available about the great Guru deals with devotional insights more and not many scholarly works had been taken up to describe him from different angles of religious and philosophical insights."
5,Great traveling companion.,"Excellent clock. Easy to read, easy to set. Unlike the Cascio, the lettering on the setting controls is white andeasily seen and understood."
1,Don't Buy,"Don't buy this product. I wanted a replacement for my last travel clock that I had also used daily on my nightstand. I couldn't find another just like it so took a chance on this Westclox Travelmate Folding Alarm Clock. Although it keeps time well, you can't see the display. It's simply too dark. You can't read it in the daytime and you can't read it at night, even if you depress the Snooze/Light button. So, what's the point in having it?!"
3,Decent liltte alarm clock but buy back up batteries!,This is a nice economical alarm clock good for travel. The alarm gives a gradual increasing beeping sound and goes for about one minute. It does shut off on its own so if you are a deep sleeper this alarm might not be for you. My recommendation is to buy extra batteries immediately. I placed the battery in backwards so that it wouldn't die out when I went on trips and upon going on my first business trip the battery was dead. So much for the alarm clock. When not in use my recommendation is to take the battery out.
4,Good Travel Clock,"I think its a good travel clock and certainly easy to set, etc. However, it is impossible to read the time in the dark and that would be the only improvement needed to give it 5 stars. So far, I've taken it on two trips and it performs just fine."
5,Basic,"This sturdy travel alarm gaves the time and has an alarm function. No weather, phases of the moon, etc. I had one before; but droped it on a hard surface & lent it to some one who packed it with the alarm set (& burning out that function on a long flight from Asia). Even after that, it still kept keeping time for a few years.I was very happy a found it again on Amazon."
4,Very functional,"Little bigger than I thought it'd be, but works great and loud enough to wake me up."
3,Reliable alarm clock,"I've had this alarm clock for years. Pros: reliable; does not glow in the dark; alarm is a simple beep sound that is not overly loud; clock stays standing on night stand and is unobtrusive; clock folds up and travels well. Cons: requires a funky battery,though I've needed to replace it infrequently; the clock really does not illuminate well enough to read in the dark when you want to check the time. For this reason I give the clock 3 stars."
2,Backlight Very Dim,"This was such a great buy and I received it in record timing according to the shipping estimate. However, I'm quite disappointed in the backlight of the clock. It is too dim. Perhaps, mine is defective because the numbers are unreadable even when the light is on. I need to turn the light on in the room to see them and that defeats the purpose of having a backlight. At least that's how my clocks have worked in the past.I would not repurchase this because I'm unable to determine if the light would be bright enough for visibility in the dark."
1,Disappointed in backlight,The back lighting on this clock is horrible. There are two small LEDs on the left and right side and they barely light up. This makes it impossible to see the time in a dark room. Wasted my money. This clock is going into the trash.
4,travel alarm isn't alarming enough!,"Great little clock, compact, easy to read, but not loud enough to wake me up! Probably fine for people with no hearing loss."
3,Westclox Travelmate Folding Alarm Clock,"Folds flat for packing, and settings are easy to use, but light that illuminates screen is so faint it can hardly be seen when you wake up at night and want to tell the time."
4,Westclox Travelmate,"WE had one for years and it finally gave out - this is a good replacement but we miss the extra feature of the former one that was the abiity to set increments of 15 minutes for short naps. Otherwise it is great. Dependable, light and convenient."
4,Found a much better price,Just bought this very same travel clock for $6.75 plus tax at my local hardware store.Haven't tried it yet...hence only 4 stars.
4,Affordable compact Home Theater,This 5.1 is priced for the budget minded person for personal or entertainment use. This is the perfect combination for the College student. With the tuner added in there are no additional expenses.A quality product that is afforadable yet dependable.
3,Decent for the price.,"First off the center channel didn't work at all, and if I plugged in the center channel it would mess up the left channel also. I stripped off the RCA plugs, and found the speaker wire to be quite thin, and easily breakable. The means that it'll be common for these speakers to loose connection if you bend the wire enough times, or get it pinched by furniture.Other than that I was surprised with the volume of the speakers which seem to fit anywhere, and can easily fill up a 256sqft room, but anything larger than that might have problems. The individual volume knobs work great for balancing out channels, but there's no total volume, or left right balance. Only 2 inputs both of which are RCA, and there's no easy way to switch between inputs either.Overall it's worth the price, but will be a hassle if you try using it for more than 1 device."
4,Never Forget,I want to thank the author for telling her story.It is important to read survivor stories.I did not care for the poetry sections.It made the account a little too melodramatic.
4,The best basketball book,"This excellent and appealing story deals with cultural differences,moving,and basketball. An eight grader,Lincoln mendoza and his mother have just moved from barriot to sycamore,due to a robberie.Lincoln misses his old neighborhood and old dirty freinds.He also misses the fights that would occur in barriot.The reason i gave this book four stars was becuase it had good parts.My favorite part in this book was the part when he played against the other team because it was all his freinds. The arthur desribed this book so great.At his new school he is playing on there basketball team which happens to play against his old school franklin he is very nervous and why does his coach dislike him?????"
4,It's a good read,This Mexican-American story is a great piece of literature. It's easy to read and it gives children of Mexican heritage an engaging story with a character whose traditions they can share in.
2,TAKING SIDES,I KINDOF LIKED THIS BOOK .THIS BOOK WAS ABOUT LINCOLN THE MAIN CHARECTER. AND SOME OF HIS FRIENDS. IT TALKS ABOUT HOW LINCOLN WENT TO A POOR SCHOOL AND THEN MOVED CAUSE HIS MOM GOT A GOOD JOB.AND THEN HE MOVEDTO A RICH SCHOOL. THREE REASONS I LIKEDTHIS BOOK IS.THIS KIND OF STUFF HAPPENS IN EVERYDAY LIFE. 2 IS THAT THIS BOOK HAS BASKETBALL INIT AND THAT IS MY FAVORITESPORT.AND THE 3RD REASON I LIKED THIS BOOK IS THAT IT WAS ABOUT BESTFRIENDS. I HAD A BESTFRIEND AND IHAD TO MOVE AND IT [STUNK].NOW I GOT A NEW BESTFRIEND .THE PART OF THIS BOOK THAT I ENJOYED .WHEBN THAT BURGULERCAME TO LINCOLNS HOUSEAND LINCOLN THREW HIS MOMS CUP .IT MISSED THE BUSGLER. I REALLY WOULDENT RECOMEND THIS BOOK.IT IS REALLY BOARING. IT REALLY DOESNT HAVE A LOT ADVENTURE.THE ONLY PEOPLE THAT WOULD RECOMEND THIS BOOK TO IS PEOPLE THAT LIKE BOARING BOOKS.
2,The Psychobabble continues,"Marianne Williamson's take on grace, mysticism, miracles, and so forth are an attempt to bring feel good spirituality into life. Williamson's text, A Course in Miracles, is the basis point for her teachings. Everyday grace is one of the more recent hodge podges of spirituality offered in an eclectic mix from Williamson whose mantra of love casts out all fear continues in her theological constructs. The one thing is .... everyday grace is far more simple than it seems. Everyday grace is about being in the flow. Williamson conjures up more feel good spirituality which she is known for."
1,really really BAD BOOK,"The Everyday Grace is written help you come back to your spiritual source, exploring ways in which we can nurture our soul. On page 4 she tells of her journey in magic, philosophy, astrology, tarot, the I Ching, she looked into Christianity, Judaism and more.As you read this book, you will see that she mixes ideas/beliefs she found in magic, philosophy, astrology, tarot, the I Ching, Christianity, Judaism, course of miracles... Now the question is this, are you OK with this book feeding you with nonsense she build up from her experience in different religions? This would be like a cake that has meat, sweets, vegetables, fruits, and dirt all in one.Bottom line: Occasional good thought does not make this a good book when it contains spiritual poison."
4,"Comforting, life-enriching","Another winner by Marianne Williamson. This book is about the themes of having hope (and maintaining it), creating happiness and forgiving the hurts of the past. Of course, these are not new themes, especially from Marianne Williamson, but it's always so soothing and renewing to read her words.Lightly touching on ""A Course in Miracles,"" Williamson shows how we can reframe our view of the universe and how we fit in it. She's right on about how many of us start our day--getting wrapped up in hectic news and things outside of us. A good day, and a good life, starts from within.I always appreciate references to spiritual texts of all faiths, but this book also used Cinderella and Snow White as metaphors, which I found elementary and perhaps even forced. Also, the use of techniques being called ""wands"" (as in magic wands) was strange and not really necessary."
3,Nothing wrong with this book.,"If you have read, A Return to Love, you don't really need this book. But I like it because it gives me a little spiritual lift each night before I go to bed. I would recommend reading A Return to Love instead of this one."
3,The Epitome of Grace,"Marianne Williamson has written a piece that is enjoyable, warm, and inspiring yet she uses a style of prose that isn't syrupy, nor riddled with platitudes and condescension. Ms. Williamson leans on ""A Course in Miracles"" and other sources either as fodder for introducing a thought or to illustrate a point already in progress. As well, the book cleverly uses the folk tale ""Cinderella"" to bolster and illumine the author's perspective from an unexpected but welcome angle. To be sure, this is a fine work and an enjoyable read that held my attention all the way through, yet I must admit that it left me wanting. There was no ""wow factor"" for me; in other words, as opposed to some of Sri Yogananda's or Neale Donald Walsch's works for example, I see no reason to read this book again, although I will give other works by Marianne a try. 3 and stars, with a 3 on the board from me."
1,BLAND,We have found Green Mountain's BREAKFAST BLEND to be VERY BLAND. Timothy's BREAKFAST BLEND is an EXCELLENT alternative.
5,Green Mountain Breakfast Blend Coffee,Very good. Green Mountain K-Cups are a good choice for the Keurig brewers. The have a wide variety of other flavors to fit most any taste.
3,The first album is much better,"Ashanti lost much of her style in this album. And it is too Murder-Inc-Publiciting! The album would be much cooler if the track ""Shany's World"" was shorter, cos it is too much time hearing []talkin! And also if the Black Child and Sugar Sack skits were cut off. Irv Gotti, stop trying to make your label even more famous through being mentioned in the albums and try having more different guest appearances in the albums, not just Murder Inc. It is getting boring..."
1,Save your money !,"I will admit that I bought this CD the first day it was released because of it's sale price and out of curiousity. After all the fuss that was made about her not being able to sing, I was prepared to hear Ashanti prove her critics wrong. Unfortunately, in my opinion, I thought the CD was horrible. I couldn't get through a single song without skipping ahead. Throughout the CD you'll hear the other artist say how beautiful and talented Ashanti is. Don't believe the hype."
2,AVERAGE AND FORGETTABLE,"How can I explain this to you without saying that this album is just average...hummm..well I guess I can't, this album has as many albums today a great hit single ""Rock Wit U Awwwwwww Baby"", I just love the Awwwww Baby thang!, and other fairly good tracks like ""Rain On Me"", but almost all the album sounds like the late 70's early 80's music. The songs fades fast out of memory and is full with promotion to other artist, whassup with that?!. I have hear to it several times and I can only remember the sounds or chorus lines of ""Break Up"" and the other one that saids ""Dreammaker make my dreams come true...."", all the songs sound the same. Well so sad that singles are not longer available!, this album is not that good as the first one and Ashanti should head up to the studio, cuz I don't see anymore hit singles in here."
2,c'mon 80's back!!!!!!,"horrible the word that can describe this awful album, her first album was ok but this is like a copy of mary j blige in her early years c'mon. the inly reason i bought this album was ""ROCK WIT U"" but the others songs , no at all. don't spend your bucks in this abum no!!!!!, (...)"
1,Please!! No More Chapters!!,"I hate to beat a dead horse, but this is hands down the worst cd of the year for 2003 and we are only half way in the year. Its hard for me to write this because I know Ashanti is trying really hard, but she just don't have it. She has a nice tone, but she has no range. Her songwriting is worst on this album,than on her last album. And once again, she is sampling every song from back in the day. No Growth. Plus, she has those annoying skits with that guy name Chink Santana (who made you want to scream, ""Shut Up all that noise""!!!). I am not hating on this girl, I really tried to like this album, but this album doesn't cut it. Despite the fact I didn't like her last (first) album, I went out like a dummy and purchased this one. Never again will I do that. This cd is a dub."
2,2 Star Effort,"Don't get me wrong Ashanti is very attractive but uh thats where is ends when I heard Rock Wit U I was like damn maybe the new cd might be something go out and cop when i went into Best Buy this summer to get it and saw that it was 9.99 i was like damn let me scoop it quick and still not knowing why there were tons on the self got home and was like what the.....the joint put me to sleep now i see why its ten dollars thats just to get it to sell to hit platinum status the cd was some real shizt for real i bareley listen to it the only songs that were good are ""Rain"" and track 2 the infamus ""ROCK awwwwwww baby"" Ashanti you say you are taking it to the next level but uh this joint is on some high school level and the skit with you and sis why? try again murder inc"
1,the best album in the world,I hope you didn't think I was serious. It sucks! Whoever considers this good music must have been deprived of real r&b/soul music sang by singers who can sing and write meaningful lyrics
2,bad,I expected so much more from her second album. CD ruined by too many skits and too much murder inc references.
1,This CD got 1 star because you're not allowed to give a zero,"This CD is straight Garbage. I don't hate Ashanti, and I caught myself dancing to the last one every now and then, BUT I can't stand this one. The only reason I bought it was because of 4 good songs. Rain On Me...definately a great song, would have helped if Irv Gotti didn't do that all-too stupid evil laugh at the beginning. The other good songs rotate between Aww...baby(the rock wit me song...), Ohhh Ahhh, and I don't mind. Other than that, Ashanti needs to REALLY listen to the people who said she couldn't sing last year. Although she says no one ever came up to her and told her she sounded terrible, she needs to take the hint from us on the Internet. Ashanti, you sound terrible. Terrible..."
1,I Love U Babygirl but this album is so bad,"I like Ashanti, just because she is not Beyonce.I love her voice. She can sing.The reason I give 1 star is just Rock Wit U (Awww baby) (It peaked #2 at billboard Hot 100) It could have been included in her first record.This album is so bad. No collabos! Bad Skits. Bad lyrics.Breakup to Makeup is aight.Get other producers.Collectables includes Rain On Me Remix!!!!!! And it's much better than the original"
2,"Still not original, some people will never change","I believe that this cd was thrown together, the first cd was better and it wasn't even that good. Murder Inc wanted to put the cd out before her fans forgot about her. They know what they are doing they release the one good song on the album (which isn't really even that good, kind of annoying (AWWW Baby what the? ) so that everyone will get excited about it. Ashanti did say that they were using the same formula to make the second album. Which is sampling, using electronics to make her voice sound better, and use the word baby in every song. She incorporates interludes that don't fit the record. She took music from the 70's/80's to use in her songs. It's not that hard to rewrite lyrics to old music. Sampling is okay but does it really need to be done for the majority of the record. She uses the word baby in 90% of her songs. She needs to find a new word to use. There's about 14 songs on the cd that I like 3."
5,Shes is da bomg,"Ashanti is such an amazing and talented artist.I luv her music and gurls especially can related to her music.I can wait til the next album,or when she gets into a movies sometime.She is so lucky to work with the murder inc family.She is a really good artist like i said before.I think her and ja rule work really good togeher too.Lata"
2,My Review,"Well After Viewing or Listening To The Cd I Kinda Couldn't Get Into The Songs She Had It's Like She Changed The Flow Up On Her Songs, Rain On Me Is Good That's Probably The Only Song I Listen To. It's Like This Album She Got Too Deep Into Soul Of R&B, And Jus't Couldn't Keep That Style She Had I Think Next Time Around She Will Know Not To Try Making A Albumb Like This. But Hey If You Like Soul R&B You Might Like It If Not Naw"
2,Chapter II &*$% ?,"This is a major step down from her first cd. I like her style and she can write but her record label is a joke and they are making her into a joke. I really like Rain on Me and Break up part 2, the rest is a waste."
1,TERRIBLE!,"This albums is horrifically horrible. I can't believe that her record label allowed her to put this album out. I loved her last album, but this one blows big time!"
2,"A Downfall from ""Ashanti""","I'm so disappointed in my girl Ashanti for making this record. If it weren't for ""Rain On Me"" and ""Rock Wit U (Awww Baby!)"", i'd have sold this album a long time ago. Hopefully her upcoming record, ""Concrete Rose"" is way better than this one. If this entire album were as good as the first 2 singles, this would've been terrific. This album just seems like it was so forced, and that it took no thought or effort. I'm happy that her vocals have improved though. I'm still a fan Ashanti!!! Better luck next time!"
1,Schyt!,"Dumb lyrics, no substance, pretentious predictable production, this CD is just terrible! Avoid at all costs!"
1,"Umm, not so good!","To tell you the truth Ashanti's new album isn't all that. I did not expect it to be like this. I would not recommend it at all, who ever wants to enjoy her music should download it online.On the other hand, Beyonce's ""Crazy in love"" & Mya's ""Moodring"" is amazing. Mya's new album to be out on July 22, is the best. The songs in it are woooo!"
2,Not happy with her this time around.,Now dont get me wrong I love Ashanti. Her whole style and everthing but this time around the CD wasn't hot. She only has like three good songs on it. And I wouldn't spend 15 dollars for 3 good songs. Her first CD was wayyyyy better. I say burn the cd off the friend and save your money for a rainy day.
2,Have you ever,"I love the music of Brandy more than that of any female musical ""Have you ever"". I will rate that album number one any female musical ever sang. I can live and end for that album because is moving and spirit lifting up music."
1,Hated It!!!!!,"All I can say is garbage. This CD is only taking up a slot in my cd holder. I've tried to listen to this cd several times and I've come to the conclusion that this is just Garbage. Good thing she has the hype, to help sell her records."
2,THE NIGHTMARE CONTINUES.....,"After I listened and did'nt like what I heard in Concrete Rose.I thought Ashanti would at least exceed my expectations with this album,unfortunately I was proved wrong(again!).The lead single,""Rock Wit' U"" is a nice song,but I got annoyed by the way she moans every two seconds of the song.The second single,""Rain on Me"" is without a doubt, a beautiful song,with solid,well-thought lyrics-something which lacks on this album.""Break up 2 Make Up"" has a good beat,but the lyrics are a different story altogether.Otherwise it just goes downhill from there.She still applies the same old formula:terrible skits and mundane songs.Ashanti has a great voice,but as I wrote before,she wastes it on crappy material,I sometimes wish there was a law protecting music-lovers from bad albums ,such as this one.Yawn."
5,It's About Time,"There is no better time in American (or global) history to tell this story. This is the most important part of US history, it needs to be understood by everyone, and needs to be understood now. Church's theatrical description of this story will be easily understood and appreciated by all. I will listen to it several times, as I have the two previous stories (Fame of Our Fathers and Road to Independence) by the King Dude."
5,U PEOPLE R OFF UR HEADS!!!,"As n english peep i wanna throw up over every1 who disses michelle mcmanus, sure she overweight its obvios but her voice is AMAZING d albums shokingly brilliant n shes realy nice n pretty n 4 ur infomation shes on a diet n alredi looks GREAT!! so shut up n sort your selfs out, shell be back in fighting force!!!!!!!!!!"
3,Sucker Move,"Wayne does a bid for a crime he did not do. Thinking that his girl Nadine will be down for him; she does the unthinkable and crosses the line. Nadine gets with Wayne's best friend/cousin Bobo, which also happens to be her best friend's boyfriend.Well Wayne gets out of prison and Bobo goes in. Guess who Nadine wants to be with now. Instead of Wayne following his head and staying away from Nadine, he does the sucker move, he reconciles with her.Well Nadine has a secret or two that she is keeping from Wayne, which ends up leading to disaster.After it was all said and done. Bobo and Wayne found out who was really down for them.The book was O.K and there were a few surprises. The editing was horrible, but you still get the meaning."
2,Weber 9989 Premium BBQ Cover,"Purchased cover to protect BBQ from the elements in the Pacific NW. Cover was not inexpensive and I expected more. Two open vent pockets are on the top, on each side, allowing rain to penetrate the cover. I sent an email to Weber, suggesting that if vents are needed that they make the cover with a three sided flap covering the vent, like on boat covers, so that the rain does not penetrate the cover. In exisiting design the cover defeats the purpose of protection, in that water enters and remains trappped inside. No reply from Weber."
3,Jim Jarmusch is an idiot,"nice album. Some typical filler tracks that are more like interludes. Mastering is non existant. doesn't break new ground? God, if that was the criteria for a good album....Anyway, biggest question is why do all the chords come on the downbeat of every measure???? Tom created such movement/syncopation on his earlier ""jazzier"" work. Oh well, time to go lip sync to ""50 cycles."""
1,Er...,What is this? Some kind of compilation of unreleased Marilyn Manson songs? Because that's all it sounds like. Just some spooky kids trying to sound like Marilyn Manson. Bleeh.
5,Great book and illustrations,The book includes English and Spanish translations of Goya's Disaster's of War series. Great collection of work by Goya about Spanish culture. I believe most are from the Napoleonic occupation of Spain of what Goya witnessed.
3,Great Read - Lousy Publisher,"I have enjoyed reading the Starbridge series and was hoping to finish them all on my eReader. They have good plots, great character development, and a truly interesting theme with excellent potential. Indeed, the books themselves earn a consistent five star rating in my opinion.Unfortunately, they are being published by Ridan Publishing - a small publishing house that has consistently promised to release books and consistently failed to do so, even when the books have long since been written. The Starbridge series is a case in point - it was promised for release around Christmas, 2011 and despite the books actually having been written years back... they remain `pending.'I do recommend this series, but caution that starting it before all are released is probably best avoided. Hopefully, Ms. Crispin will either change publishers, self publish via Amazon, or force Ridan to finish the series."
1,Unhappy customer,"Twice I had to return this Rod Stewart CD. Both CDs were defective. I do want this specific CD, but was told that it could not be replaced again. Am very disappointed and would still like a replacement. I found it very difficult getting my message across to a ""human being"" at Amazon. I gave up in total frustration!!!!"
4,"WHERE IS ""Stay with me""-------REALLY ?????","Someone, please someone......get this record label and ROD to add the song ""STAY WITH ME "",.....on this great album. NOW !!! Re-release this with the SONG. Maybe remaster as well. MAN, OH-MAN....what a serious left off-of mess-up. THIS SONG IS WHAT ROD IS KNOWN FOR. Fix it now !!!!"
5,axmen,"The axmen DVD was great for my husband.It was delivered before the date stated, so that was great.He loved watching."
5,This CD is excellent!Ce CD est excellent!!,"Hi! Lorie's first CD is a big success. She offers her awesome voice to give francophones the liberty of finding themselves in the french musique passion. She is the Britney Spears in french...she's sexy, blonde, all-around good sport and very talented, but she doesn't sell herself butt-naked(opposed to Britney). It's excellent to have this artist in the business!Allo! Le premier disque(album) de Lorie est un grand succes. Lorie prete sa voiz magnifique pour offrir au francophones la liberter de se retrouver dans la passion de la musique francaise! Elle est la Britney Spears francophone...elle est sexy, blonde et tres talenter, mais elle ne vend vend pas sans linge(opposer a Britney). C'est excellent d'avoir cette artiste dans cette ""business""!"
4,Pretty good,"This book was a neat concept, in that we get to see these two characters in two different times. I didn't exactly love the beginning part where they fall in love in the present time. I thought it was a bit rushed and a bit too giggly and perfect. Reed's acceptance of the future and his ability to blend in was a little unbelievable, especially the driving part. But, just when I thought it was getting too silly, he disappears, and then when Elise goes back to his time and discovers that he doesn't remember her, that is when it starts to get good. Your emotions then go up and down with Elise's as she desperately tries to get her own husband to remember her before he marries someone else. The ending was great, but I wish that it had continued on a few more pages after Reed remembers her, that way you felt a complete ending to the story. Overall a good read."
5,The best of all her books.,"It was my favorite of her books... especially since ""Don and Jan"" are my parents in real life!"
5,This game is dope,"I just bought this game today and it is awesome. All the teams, all the action, good commentary, all the qualifying you could want - just a sick game."
3,stone is big,With this ring is only problem stone is too big. I expect something stylish and elegant. It is not it.
4,Nice Scent...Great for winter.,"I think this is a great fall/winter scent. It is warm and as a great aroma. I get compliments a lot of this fragrance and I think the price is right. I am also in my 20's and have never heard of it being a ""old lady"" scent. I think it is a more adult scent...not young and fruity. I also think it is a scent that a lot of different people enjoy. I give it a lot as a gift. Try it!"
2,Poor choice of wording.,"If it weren't for the use of the word ""dumb"" in this book, I would give it 5 stars.My son loves this books and picks it out at the library, and asks me to get it for him. The story has a wonderful playful rhythm to it as it is read aloud, and this makes it quite fun to read, but thanks to this book, my son is now familiar with name-calling and the word ""dumb"". Very disappointing. I have tried to substitute the word with something else, but know my son knows it too well. I explain to him that we don't use this word in our family and that it is a bad word to use, and he seems to understand that, but how sad to learn name-calling in a children's book. Although Rosemary Wells may have thought that kids learn to say these things anyhow from other kids, why help perpetuate it? Because the word ""dumb"" is part of the rhyming nature of the book, it is hard to come up with a substitute, and I can't help but wonder why the Wells didn't use the word ""glum"" or something else less hurtful."
2,Russ,"I had my s9100 for one months now and here is my opinion. It has many nice features, bells and whistles as they say, but the picture quality is not there, it is soft. It doesn't have the sharpness, saturation, and contrast (even when the mode is set on hard in the menu) that I want in a picture. It might pass on the monitor or TV but not anything larger than 6 x 4 in. in print. My first digital camera, Olympus C-4000 4.0 mp ($600) and my small Concord 3340z 3.1 mp ($99) which is strapped to my belt like a cell phone, outperforms this digital camera as far as image quality, sad to say."
5,"Great,easy to use camera.","This camera is easy to operate.Takes excellent pictures.Just like cameras you add lens to,all in one,no need to remove lens.Great wide angle and zoom.Camera auto focus is noisy.When using it in a quiet place where people are trying to listen,they will look at you trying to find out where the noise is coming from,(at church service).I just love this camera,and I can over look the noise.Takes great pictures with telescopic add on lens accessory(X3.22)."
2,"Great Point and Shoot, Relatively Low Noise, Horrible Customer Service","The Fuji 9000 family is a great camera for individuals looking for ""near"" entry level SLR performance with a great fixed lens along with decent movie capability. The SuperCCD offers excellent well balanced images and the manual focus ring is extremely responsive.Just pray that nothing goes wrong with camera, Fuji doesn't stand behind their product or warranty. I had a knob break off from the camera during normal use (switching from between modes). I had used the camera almost daily for 4 months and the unit was still under warranty.After shipping the unit back to Fuji I recieved a bill several weeks later stating the fault was caused by impact damage (load of c%*p) and I had to pay $120 to get my camera back.This is in stark contrast to my experience with Panasonic customer service, where I've recieved a replacement camera in as little as 5 days from them under their warranty policy."
3,Could be sturdier..,The hoop is just not quite sturdy enough and I need to be very careful with it to keep it from snapping.
4,"Murder, He Said...","I love Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds, but this CD scared the crap out of me...I mean really, literally, turning the lights on and checking in the dark closets with a baseball bat scared...and I was pretty freaked out right up to track ten where Nick and company turn around and suddenly make the last 55 minutes of blood, violence, gore, mayhem and murder seem to somehow be O.K. Brilliant! And a happy ending from Nick Cave. Who would have thunk it?!?"
2,Totally overrated,"If Metallica's beer-drinking lead singer called this one of his favorite albums because of its ""gory details"", then you know something must be wrong.This is one of Mr.Cave's weakest albums not only because some of the lyrics are simply too cheesy to take them seriously(unless you're a goth teenager), but also because Cave made this record just to have fun with his buddies and girlfriends. The band never went on tour to support this album; they were exhausted after the Lollapalooza and Henry's Dream tours. They needed to relax. And that is exactly what they did in ""Murder Ballads"".The only good thing about this album was the fact that Mr.Cave and his Seeds got a wider exposure here in the U.S. without having to sell out.If I'm giving ""Murder Ballads"" two stars is simply because ""Stagger Lee"" is way too cool. Specially live.Check out Your Funeral, My Trial, Tender Prey, or The Good Son if you really want to know what made Nick Cave and the Bad Seed legends."
3,Not for the dilettante....,"This collection is definitely NOT for the casual disco lover, but I do like it because it features some hard-to-find songs by artists I enjoy. Amii Stewart and Candi Staton are better known for their hits, ""Knock On Wood"" (also in this collection) and ""Young Hearts, Run Free"" respectively. This compilation includes their covers of the Doors' ""Light My Fire"" and Elvis Presley's ""Suspicious Minds"". Other highlights include Dynasty's ""I Don't Want to Be a Freak"", Lonnie Youngblood's ""Gonna Fly Now"" ('Rocky' Disco-style!), and Carrie Lucas' ""Dance With You"". Not a great starter kit for the disco fan, but a good way to fill out your collection with some rarer tunes!"
3,Johnny Depp Illustrated Biography,I liked the photos as some were ones that I had never seen before. The information was basically what I already learned from the Johnny Depp Photo Album by Christopher Heard and that remains my favorite Johnny Depp book.
3,Excitingly Amazing,"Once I finished this book I was amazed that it pleased me so much. For one thing I really don't like the way Cash treats Mariah, but because of all that he has been through you can't help unserstand his wariness. It should me that even through all of lifes troubles you can still look past them and trust again. The book is also amusing at times. And I also like it that they're out in the wilderness away from all the ohter people and the world."
4,Yes Twenty-One Is Legal,"To me this album is for people Who love to party and dance. There are only two tracks that I truly enjoy on the album and they are ""Just Can't Let You Go"". I for some reason love the drums the bass in that song. The other song is called ""DO It"". And as much as it pain's me to admit this, the reason I like the song is because of the hook the young lady sings on the song along with the ridiculous beat. For the track ""Ice Box"" I not only enjoy the message of the song ,but I also enjoyed the beat of the song as well. What I did not appreciate about the track was being called out my name towards the end of the tack. If you are looking for a song that is true to life then, the track ""What Are We Doing"" is for you as far as relationships are concerned. What I do think is missing from this album is a beauitful ballad. But, I will say this to MR.Omarion I do thank you for holding your own on this album and by that,I mean there are no guess appearances you stand alone as an artist."
1,im disapointed.....,more and more this year i am seeing copiers and personally omarions new album is a bunch of crap that song icebox sounds alot like b5s song erica kane if u really listen to b5s song and then listen to his u can tell omarions has some hits but when he came out with cd it disappointed me alot of people are copying b5's style and well they to be promoted better omarion is talented and cute as can be but he dont need to be copying others people style he has his own smooth style thankin yo for takin the time to read this revies
3,Its a good starting point but it doesn't cover everything,"This book is great for beginners. It covers nearly every kind of hardware that has ever gone in a standard PC. It does a great job of explaining old/obsolete/outdated hardware as well. However, information on new stuff, like PCIe, SATA and DDR2, is pretty scarce.The troubleshooting charts and techniques are a little thin and there is very little coverage of troubleshooting techniques for the operating system.If you want to learn about computer hardware, this book is everything you are looking for and more. If you are looking for a complete book on troubleshooting & fixing computers, it is a good starting point, but you will need another book to help you with OS problems."
1,"bad, bad album","Do not take this artist seriously. He is just an invention of Brazilian press. Bad, very bad album."
4,Dean Stockwell... son of Yog-Sothoth?,"Given the time that this was made, it isn't bad.. shame they didn't touch more on the mythos in it, but I think that is because HPL wasn't something that sold easily in the 70's, so they made it more of a ""devil cult"" film in the hope of cashing in on that craze.For fans of HPL, it is ok. I think Dean Stockwell did what he could with the role, and Sandra Dee was obviously brought in for sex appeal.I bought this movie more out of nostalgia than anything else, having viewed it at midnight showings over the years, and I wanted it for my home theater collection. The reseller I purchased it from was the fastest response from a reseller I have ever gotten from Amazon."
4,enjoyable nonsense,"Lovecraft might roll in his grave, but if you can forget it is based on his brilliant works, and just kick back, it's not that bad. Beautifully, though cheaply filmed, and hurt by the poor, monotone performances of Sandra Dee and Dean Stockwell...the movie is still good for a late night horrorfest!Would recommend it for purchase to only ardent horror fans, as others may not want repeat viewing, feeling once is enough.Much better done as Haunted Palace with Price"
3,Decent DVD,"I really liked this DVD. However, my advice is to buy it for ""Die Monster Die!"". Boris plays an awesome roll as always, one of the few last films before he passed away, and Nick Adams, a truly awesome actor, who is sadly missed, who knows what kind of ""star"" level this actor would have today if he was still alive, but, his acting will truly be missed.However, the second film is just a pure dud to be honest. I would have given it a 4 if it wasn't for this film. I like Stockwell, but, this isn't one of his best films..and the late Sandra Dee in a horror film?..you got to be kidding!..anyways, this film is nothing but a filler at best."
1,0 STARS: A nice cure for insomnia,"It was on Halloween night that I watched this movie called ""The Dunwich Horror"" and maybe I was just overexpecting, but 30 minutes into the movie, I just got bored stiff watching it. In fact, I fell asleep, something I hadn't been able to do recently before actually viewing this sleep aid. Thanks to ""The Dunwich Horror"", my insomnia has been cured! Other than that, I would say it's best to leave ""The Dunwich Horror"" on the video store shelf."
2,"Amazon 5 stars, microsoft 1 star",Amazon was great for the fact that the return was so easy. Microsoft only gets 1 star for the fact the brand new product was defective. Amazon sent a replacement that worked right away.
1,"One battery, not two. Very dishonest advertising.","Pictures in this add show two rechargeable batteries, but only one is in the package.Nothing in the description says different.False advertising and very deceptive. Not happy with this type of practice."
1,"Don't waste your money, these batteries don't hold a charge","People - don't buy this product. It's a complete rip off for 2 reasons.First of all, the batteries do not hold a charge at all. If you let this sit around for even just one week without using it, all the juice will be gone.Second, it's no cheaper than standard rechargeable batteries, so why not just use those to begin with? Not only will they work better, but you can also use them with any other product. This battery pack is propietary and only works with 360 controllers. If it was insanely awesome battery time it might be worth it, but it's not, so don't waste your money!"
1,Dont waste money,"Why spend $30 dollars on this battery charger that can only charge batteries for one purpose, the 360 controller. For half the price you can buy a charger and 4 AA rechargable batteries at walmart or amazon. Its half the price, you get two sets of batteries for the remote if thats all you will use them for, or you can also use the batteries in anything in your home like remotes or mp3 players. So spend half the price, get twice the functionality and be a smarter person."
1,Out of Date,There are so many new roads in Costa Rica and so many roads that have recently been paved that a road map of Costa Rica published in 2005 is out of date. This map must be updated every year or two to be accurate.
4,Good map,The map was very handy navigating around Costa Rica. More detailed and sturdy than the maps given out at the rental car agency or hotels.
5,Excellent Map,"Good detail and waterproof, (but not with a heavy laminate, more like a waxy coating). Highly functional."
3,Good map but leaves out important info,"This is a good map. Gas station icons would be a helpful addition. Also, the map could better indicate road condition including the need to drive through rivers. I did a great deal of research that caused me to rule out trip alternatives. Using the map as my primary reference, thinking I could take off and drive the roads indicated, would be a big mistake."
5,Great Map,"This is the first map I have found of Costa Rica that shows smaller roads. It is great and the waterproof property is fantastic. Not only will it resist the rain, it doesn't tear."
5,Very helpful! Best map!,"Very helpful! Best map!GPS is still a must as it tells you all about one ways, bumps, best routs, etc."
5,Get serious.,"This is Steve McQueen.As the Pastel Six said in their 1962 hit, The Cinnamon Cinder, ""You either got it or you don't.""Well, do you?Get it."
5,MVP,"I think MVP by Douglas Evans was a very suspenseful book that captivated my attention and interest until the very end. Readers who enjoy exotic books will like this adventerous fiction tale of MVP. This time seeking book is about Adam Story and other twelve-year-olds racing around the world, with no adults, in forty days or less. If you reach home base traveling by land and water only, you recieve $4 million. Adam gets challenged by Prince Olioli Oh to travel for his Magellan Voyage Project in the Great Global Game. On a scale from 0-5, I would give this outrageous story a 5 star rating. I would give MVP a 5 star rating because it made me feel like I was a player in the competition, trying to race around the world in 40 summer days! If you like traveling, learning new things, and are up for a competition, pick up a copy of MVP, the worldwide journey of twelve-year-olds."
5,Around the World!,"This is a great fast read. A twelve-year-old boy travels around the world by taking trains, ships, and buses only. Read how he does it in 40 days! This book came out a few years ago and I'm glad I found it. Like other reviews say, it would make a great movie!"
1,same as the printed verson of the on line doc.,When using the book to set up a new NetWare6 server what the book said to do is the same as what is on the screen. this was my first time setting up a server and to have Zero back ground in netware the book was hard to use.
2,Soft content -- not meaty enough for exam prep,"The SQL Server 6.5 Administration Study Guide presents information in a clear and consise manner. Questions are provided at the end of each chapter for review. However, neither the questions nor the content prepare you for the actual exam questions. I found that little of the material covered was up to the caliber of the actual test questions. I do not recommend this as the sole study guide for the SQL Server 6.5 Admin exam."
5,Made for a Gentleman,"When I ordered this product I was kinda skeptic but I was well pleased.It looks very elegant and made with the looks of a polished,expensive merchandise.I highly recommend it for anyone wanting to give a nice attractive gift."
3,"Understanding the ""other side""","Amity Pierce Buxton's book is a good resource, to a point, for spouses who find themselves in a mixed-orientation marriage. While I found that the stories were somewhat outdated and I had difficulty relating to them, the statistical information in the book makes it worth the read. It reads a bit like a scholarly textbook outside the personal testimonies, so expect it to be dry in places.But it does provide information and stats to the straight spouse. Some of these statistics can be pretty depressing, and I found that the book does not really cover all of the different types of mixed-orientation marriages, and the ways that many couples come up with to retain a relationship with their spouses.All in all, an interesting and informative read, but somewhat outdated."
1,Go online for headhunter info. Its free and more up to date.,"This was totally useless information. I do not recommend that anyone buy this book. Go online and get free headhunter information, and save yourself the agony of reading this outdated job search info. What a waste."
4,Really Helps,"One of the few resources, along with Vaultreports.com, that I have seen which provides great preparation for the recuruitment and hiring process."
2,DVD STRUCTURE PROBLEMS AND SOLUTION,"It's not the Movie that I rate but the DVD itself.I received this item 3x times form amazon.All three DVD's have DVDstucture problems/faults.I tested it on different region free players and PC and when I click on play movie or go to chapters when I see the menu for the first time, it will play the extra's or it freezes/black screen.Luckily there is a workaround for this. For more people having these problems to this:Go to Bonus Features and then click op set-up and choose Wideschreen movie or Fullscreen movie (doesn't matter which one you choose) then go back to the main menu and the buttons play movie and chapters work and you can watch your favourite G.i. Joe movie!This is ofcourse not the way how it supposed to work but atleast you can watch the movie!"
5,A bridge turned into a spider... and THEN things got wierd,"While this finale of the 80's animated series did end on a very trippy note, it's still well worth watching. As kids, we found this awesome... as adults, we can see it as a comedy. The movie introduces new characters while ushering out some old favorites (though a re-edit changes one popular character's death into ""just a coma"") and gives the audience plenty of quotable moments. Watch with friends, drinks, and with a lack of seriousness."
5,GI Joe the Movie,This movie changed GI Joe after it was shown. I think the cartoon series would have lasted much longer if the movie had not come out.
1,would not play,bought this early for our son for xmas. he opened it and it will not play. When you hit play on the menu it simply stops the dvd and does nothing else. we bought to early and are not eligible for a return.
4,Good '80s action cartoon,In the mid eighties when I was a kid I enjoyed seeing the G.i. joe cartoons every day of the week with great adventures and lot of thrills.They were a bunch of heroes fighting against their mortal foes the Cobra terrorist organization where nobody dies(except in the movie) and the Cobra commander always escaped from the joes.When I see that the GIjoe movie was avaliable on Dvd I thought what movie was because this movie wasn't avaliable on Spain and I never see any long feature only the weekly episodes of 30 minutes long.The plot is good with great action good secuences and good f/x.Good dvd.
2,yuck!,"Hey, I'm a fan ... but I just could not get over that stupid Cobra-la-la-la-la crap. The story is moronic, the only saving grace is that you get to see some of the neat toys in action. 'Nuf said."
5,Simply awesome,"After years of hiding, superman comes back with the justice league after kansas is destroyed. The story is told through the eyes of a preacher after the spectre tells him he will judge armeggedon. The book is armeggedon superhero style and has fantastic artwork to boot. Simply put, Buy This Book."
2,Story had me at a total loss,"Reading other reviews, it seems like I'm the exception for not liking this story. When I began to read this story, I saw immediately how different the comic art was compared to other books I've read. I did not like the realness of the artwork, but I still decided to give it a chance. From the very beginning, there was alot of biblical context in this story and that was also a turn off for me. 40 pages in, I still had no idea what was going on because I had trouble identifying the characters because of the realistic artwork. Enough was enough for me because I couldn't follow this story anymore. I'm not saying that I didn't like Kingdom Come, but it was very difficult for me to follow who was who and what exactly was going on. I know this was supposed to be in the DC Universe future, but maybe because of the other stories I'm currently reading, this one made no sense. Overall, I would not try to read this story again until I got some more DC knowledge under my belt."
2,Comic books are awful on the kindle app,"I purchased this to see how comic books read on the kindle app for my asus tablet and the experience is terrible, I couldn't pinch to zoom and the predetermined zooms for the word balloons didn't include much of the art, also the app didn't allow for screen rotation. All in all very counterintuitive, its a shame too because the prices for some of these trades are very fair. Thankfully Amazon fulfilled an immediate refund."
5,Restores the Heroic Ideal,"In years gone by I read Darknight, Watchmen, et. al. and loved them. However, as time went on, it seemed that all comics had to offer audiences any more were brutal worlds full of brutal villains being fought by ""heroes"" who don't win until they finally decide to be as brutal as their opponents. Somewhere along the way, something higher was being ignored. It was one thing to LET the heroes make hobsonian choices, but it's quite another to not be able to write stories about them doing anything else. Now that's changed. This comic has a world as dark and desperate as any, but unlike other comics, does not conclude that this means that the heroic ideal is dead, but rather that it is more needed than ever."
2,Just not that good,Beautiful art but the story and particularly the dialogue are weak. Alan Moore set the benchmark for this kind of thing years ago and Kingdom Come does not measure up.
5,Blessed Assurance,"This is one of many great works by Lloyd-Jones. Though 672 pages might seem excessive to devote to one chapter of one book in the Bible, each page is filled with spiritual truths presented for laymen, but with scholarship. I believe that the subject of assurance is one of the most overlooked and misunderstood Christian doctrines. This book gives glory to the Lord our God, Jesus Christ who is the author and perfecter of our salvation, and comfort to those whom he has saved."
5,If you don't have it..BUY IT!!!!,"I'll keep it simple. This is the kind of CD that can get people into Drum & Bass even if they have never heard it before. I work in a record shop, and when this came out I sold a ton of them just by having it play in the store. The Cd doesn't dissappoint ....and as a collector of tunes I LOVE the fact that this turned me on to a couple of gems that I had overlooked. tracks like ""Esfera"", ""Futures Call"" with MC Conrad,""81 is the Number"",and the Amazing ""Torch of Freedom"" with Cleveland watkiss on vocals, just put you right on the beach, as far away from your troubles as you could get! It is a true reminder that Drum & Bass is ""MUSIC"" and reaches beyond just hard beats and bass...right to the SOUL! This is the music I will play my grandchildren when I tell them what Pop Pop likes to hear :)"
5,Always makes me feel good,"So much fun. Have watched this film over and over and it still makes me laugh. If you want a light hearted frolic through silly moments, memorable quotes and fab dance sequences then look no further. In my humble opinion this film is destined to be a classic for this generation."
1,Disappointment,I was not happy at all with this product. I have dark circles under both eyes which have only appeared over the last couple of years. (I am 39)...I had been hoping for a great product to lighten them a bit and this did nothing and cost a fortune. I would not recommend this product at all.
5,The music is hot!!!!!!,"I had the pleasure of checking out the tracks on this album @ http://www.diamondworkproductions.com/compilation.htm ,and I must say the sh** is tight !If you like that down south style of rap,then this is one you must add to your collection!!!"
5,Dr.Wolff challenges you to think for yourself .,"Dr.Wolff starts with well-known phyical laws and demonstrates their logic, but he then leads you into new areas of analysis and controversy. This is an excellent book for the student who wants to extend his exploration of physics from first principles!"
5,arrived on time in good condition thanks for the speedy shipment,"I started this little book yesterday, and since I am into lots of history at the present time, I think it will add to my knowledge of the early history of America"
1,Not worth the price,"I cannot believe that am giving this to my girl. The picture looks way better than the necklace itself. an 18 inch necklace shouldn't be so small, yet it is.One more thing, the crystals do not seem as big as the picture.The metal that connects the crystals together; looks very cheap, very durable, could break/bend by any slight force. My water bottle's cap looks more expensive than this metal.what else can I say about this cheap product. I've just received this and am very very very disappointed and upset about it."
1,Ugh!!,"Worst baseball game out there.... Every pitch you make a strike they hit ,they never swing at balls..You have no movement of the ball ,but some how the computer does...I just busted my game today..You can never throw a no hitter and you have to score over 10 or more runs to win..."
4,Low To The Ground - a very good debut album,"It's hard to believe that this is the debut album for Stockcar Named Desire. The songs are excellent and fun to dance to or just listen to. The lyrics are fun and humorous. The tunes are great - classic yet original. I think this band will go far, and anyone with a soft spot for rockabilly music, or just has a wide variety of music that they listen to should definitely buy this CD. With top notch instrumentals and first class singing talent, this is an excellent album that anyone can appreciate. So crank it up and have fun!"
3,Almost a great product,"Many of the other reviews are correct, wait for MoGo to perfect the optical tracker. It works well for everyday tasks like navigating trough files, writing word document, and working on spread sheets, but if you do precision work like I do it becomes a pain. The curser can be a little jittery and when I am working in Illustrator or ArcMap it becomes a real pain. If you put down a sheet of plain white paper I find it drastically reduces the jittery movements, but they are still there. Everything else about the mouse works great. It easily finds my computer when I turn it on and I haven't had any power issues. If the next version improves tracking I will gladly buy it. Oh, and a scroll bar/wheel would be nice."
3,It was missing a booklet,it didn't have a booklet inside the boxset and i love to read the booklet so I'm disappointed about that
1,"NO stars, actually","I don't know what this product's propellant is but it left my !edible! work smelling as strong as butane or acetone. Honestly, a HazMat situation."
4,A Spiritual Approach to Parenting,"This book is a gem camoflaged in a boring paper back cover. I owned this book for six months before I ever even cracked the cover. It poses some of the most profound questions mothers (and fathers) might ever ask... and then it points to scripture that addresses those concerns. The topics range from dealing with a short temper to worrying about a child's safety to guilt about mistakes made in the heat of parental battle. Whether you are facing a crisis or just seeking counsel for your daily choices for your child, you can turn here to learn what scripture advises you to do and pray, and also what scripture promises God will bring to pass. This is a must have for parents who want to rear Godly children."
2,"Not Astro City, Not Marvels","I recently discovered Busiek's Astro City, and I ordered this graphic novel expecting a much, much deeper story.This is a straightforward Avenger's comic book, written in a comic-book style (with excellent comic-book art by Perez). It's not in any sense groundbreaking, it doesn't offer a novel view point, and it doesn't develop the characters to any great degree. Everything's spelled out in captions, thought balloons, and comic-book dialog, with little subtext. It's not very ""Busiek"".I heartily recommend Busiek's Astro City works and his amazing Marvels too. I don't recommend Avengers: The Morgan Conquest unless you're a mainstream comic fan looking for more Avengers action."
2,More bad than good.,"I didn't really have high hopes coming into this movie. It had it's moments, but, overall, it was cheesy, corny, and just not great."
3,Acceptable at best,Pros: Is cool. Other humidifiers I have had heated up the room with steam. Easier to clean than most.Cons: No humidity indicator. No steam and although the reservoir is empty after a days run I cannot feel moisture in the air. I have to assume it is there though because that water had to go somewhere.
4,Great fun at a great price!,"My daughter, 9, received this for Easter this year. She loves horses and very much enjoys My Little Pony. Of all the ""stuff"" she got in her Easter basket this was the biggest hit.Three ponies get to have a wonderful eloquent picnic with all the accessories. It was packaged perfectly for spring/Easter, in a basket with green grass.I purchased mine at a grocery store and the price was $10.00. Very affordable for what it comes with. Even at $15 it is worth the price.This would be great also as a birthday gift.I think any little girl into horses/ponies would love to have this"
2,"Great Title, But Too Much of a Narrow Focus","I loved the title, and the book was recommended to me as an ""alternative health"" book, but it seems the author is totally hung up on megadoses of Vitamin C and juicing vegetables for health. Not much help."
3,Use with Medical Supervision,"I appreciate Dr. Saul's research in his area of study and have followed some of his advice with great success. I would only suggest, as he does in his book, that you find a licensed medical practitioner that is integrative in his or her approach to ALL forms of medical therapy since your standard allopathic care physician may not be supportive of the advice Dr. Saul has in his book."
2,Disappointed in content,"This book did not meet my expectations. It was not throughly done and many common ailments were not addressed. It is not a book I will use as a reference, and I'd get my money back if I could."
3,HArd to rate,The other reviews were correct. My wife is a size 2 so I went with the recommended sizing on the item. It was wrong. I had to return the brace for a larger one. I will update the review whe the new one returns.
3,Almost perfect!,"This lid is great. I live in germany, and bought mine several years before it was available in the States. It is easy to use and works better than anything other lid out there. The problems come later. The handle is held on be only one screw. it is designed to spin as the user needs it to, but the screw becomes loose and the hande then spins to fast and to often, causing the lid to become unstable and unpredictable. Also, the non-stick coating doesn't stay on very long. Between the hot oil and the dishwasher, this thing started rusting after about 6 months of use. So while I love useing the handle, and nothing I've ever seen works better, it does not hold up like other Silit products I own have. I still recomend other Silit products, but not this one."
3,an annoying disgrace,u see a lil girl murdered and you think itll be scary but then the rest of the game is u trying to hide from an annoying freddy kruger wannabe with a beergut who says the same stupid alyssa were are u over and over every 5 seconds u dont fight u simply hide in places until he goes away if it was pulled off well it might work but the graphics are level after level of grey desolate wastelands and the sounds regrettable at best dont buy this heck resident evil on playstation 1 is better no joke playing this games about as fun as watching reruns of mork and mindy this pile of crap is best used as a frisbee
2,Kinda stupid,"Clock Tower 3 is fun at first and really is scary. you will not play this game alone, i guarentee you. the weird creatures with hammers chase you around and call for your name ""Alyssa where are you"" when you are hiding in a locker, phone booth Etc. It is fun if you are planning on breaking your PS2, because this game will make you do just that. The game is impossible to beat and you can't take five steps before you hear the creepy music, which means a monster is nearby and is looking for you. amd when they are gone you will see them disappear through a blue portal that came out of nowhere.Though the game is fun, rent it, don't buy it."
1,Can't get past the intense anal sex scene,"Rented this for a date night with my wife, have liked most all of Jim Carry movies. All was good until the ""intense"" anal sex scene. We try and be open minded but that was as far as we could go. Maybe this is a good story line...but will never know. Just wasn't expecting this...."
5,An exceptionally comprehensive volume,"It's not for beginners ? ok, it's not.It's mainly for intermediate readers and it goes reasonably deep and covers an impressive wide range of topics.It's not an reference guide, if you need one, get the ActionScript reference guide from Macromedia.If you want to learn Object-Oriented Development with ActionScript 2.0 the Moock's book is the best choice. For me, the ActionScript Bible and the Moock's book are special volumes."
3,This book is not for beginners!,"I am no dummy when it comes to using software or teaching books, but this one is over my head. I am a beginner with Flash MX 2004. I would prefer hands on, step by step tutorials....at least until I have a grasp of the basics. At over 1200 pages, I am sure that I will be using this book as a reference in the future. For now, I need to start a little slower."
4,Not bad at all,I can't complain about this one. Why? Because of how cheap it is. The audio is great and the video (something no CD has) gives you the chance to see Steve at work. So what if he's only guitar-synching.
3,Another Jodi Picoult Masterpiece,"Although I am only 60% into this book, I want to say something about it. Jodi Picoult really delves into some issues, researches them thoroughly, and brings them to life in her well-developed characters. This one truly takes us to the dark side and gives me the chills during the dog days of summer. Parts of this book, however, are done in a graphic novel format which is lost to me in the Kindle edition. If I had this book to buy over again, it would be in a paper format."
2,Disappointing,"Like alot of other reviewers of this book, I've read everything Jodi Picoult has written. I absolutely loved The Pact, My Sister's Keeper, Keeping Faith, Salem Falls, and Second Glance. I've hated Perfect Match, Picture Perfect, Vanishing Acts, and now this, The Tenth Circle. Okay, maybe hate is too strong a word for this one. The first two thirds were well-written and made sense (for the most part.) The last third was a complete mess. I really wish Jodi would stop the gimmicks, like going to Alaska (why???) and just tell the damn story. By the end I honestly didn't care what happened, I just wanted it to be over. It was too convoluted and over-the-top. It's too bad, but I think quality has been sacrificed for quantity. Maybe it's not possible to write great books if you're cranking them out once a year. I don't know. It's a shame, because some of her books are so great. But this one... if you're going to read it, check it out from the library, don't buy it."
2,This Book Was Bewildering,"While I usually enjoy Jodi Picoult's books, this one I didn't get. There was something mystical about it... something not quite properly believable. Now, others of her books also bear a sense of unreality, and yet I was able to love them (the one with the Lia... I forget the title... is a great example), but this one somehow missed artfulness and fell into wispiness. It reminded me on some level of the end of Tess of the D'Urbervilles in, its attempt to be impressive, to be tragic, to be significant. Maybe Ms. Picoult had to finish it for a deadline? But as she did so, her heart wasn't in it; her audience moreso endures it to the end rather than joining her in a cathartic finish."
4,Very well done. Crappy ending.,I really liked this book except for the ending. I didn't like how she just left you hanging on the whole situation. There needed to be more of a relationship between Trixie and Willie. The ending seemed very rushed and understated.
2,"Love Jodi Picoult, but not this book!!","I began reading this and called a few friends to recommend it. It started out great. Picoult did a great job of introducing us to the characters. I couldn't put the book down for the first half. Once I got close to the end I couldn't believe how twisted and boring it got. I'm still not really sure what happened!! It was almost as if Picoult had to rush to get the book to the publisher so she just threw something together. I've never been disappointed with her until this book came along. Usually after I read her books it takes me a week or two before I stop thinking about the book that I just read. This book was very forgettable. I've heard great things about Nineteen Minutes but this book was so bad that I'm not sure I want to waste anytime trying it out.Jodi Picoult is a great author, but I highly recommend skipping this book!"
3,Not all that good,I love Jodi Picoult. She is such a wonderful writer! I didn't really like this book but I will definitely continue to read her work. They can't all be 5 stars.
2,Frustrated with the ending,"I've read a number of books that grab my attention and keep me going, but then drop me flat at the conclusion. It is almost as if the author got tired of the book and quickly tied up the loose ends with one big band-aid, just to get it over with. The Tenth Circle was that way for me. Like other reviewers, I felt a lot of the high school angst was overdone, the sex-drugs-mean girls stuff portrayed the teen environment in the small town as a real awful place to grow up. I liked Daniel, but never found out if he finished his work on time for the publisher, wanted to shake some sense in Trixie, and found the involvement of Laura with the hockey player's demise very contrived. I've liked other Picoult books but this one made me glad when it was over."
4,agree with previous reviews,I think that some of the over-the-top parts of the story might be inspired by the imaginative and saga-like comic style. Entertained.
3,not what I expected,"I guess I should know better than to compare any of Jodi Picoult's work with My Sister's Keeper. There is no comparison to that book. I really enjoyed the first 3/4 of The Tenth Circle but the last fourth left something to be desired. The ending teetered on cheesy and certainly could have been more exciting. Jodi Picoult is talented, no doubt about it, but this book just left me as a reader high and dry. I will read her other works as I have been impressed by the others I have read but I need to get this book out of my head first."
3,Disappointing,"This is my least favorite Picoult book. I could not conjure up any sympathy for Trixie with regard to her ""date rape"", the validity of which is questionable, considering the circumstances. I didn't feel a lot of connection to any of the characters in this book, which is unusual for one of Jodi Picoult's books."
2,Disappointed in Picoult,"I could not wait to read this novel, since I loved others by this author. The first few chapters were interesting, but as the novel continued, I found myself wanting to edit a lot of it. The Alaska information was not relevant and seemed to be a chance for the author to show how much research she had done on that culture. It just did not ring true to me. And this is a family who needs a serious few years in marital and family counseling.I read other reviews and was so relieved to see that I am not the only disappointed Picoult fan. As the plot winds down, I find myself praying that they find some redemption, but I have read enough reviews to learn they don't. That was my one reason for sticking with this novel. I have had enough."
2,Not her best book.,"(MAY contain some spoiler information...)I only finished reading this book because once I start a book I feel bad putting it down without at least knowing how it ends. At the end of the book I wanted to throw it against the wall. Not because it had such a cliffhanger ending or a depressing ending as is common with her books. Because I couldn't stand the main character or her family and I couldn't stand how things were handled through out the book. The book was made to inform about rape and how women have to fight as the victim, however in the end she makes a mockery of the rave ""victim"" if she can even be called that by the end. I feel that she went into it very well and the first 1/2 did go into good information about rape and what it does to women, however by the end I began to side with the boy! I would never recommend this book to anyone."
3,Interesting,"After reading My Sister's Keeper by Jodi Piccoult, I decided to read The Tenth Circle because I wanted to read more of her work. While the topic of the book was interesting, I have to say that I wasn't blown away as I was with the previous book. It was interesting enough to finish the book, but didn't provoke any reflection in my part after reading a book. If you haven't read any of Piccoult books I would suggest reading another of her books before dabbing into this one."
5,Kudos!,"I really enjoyed this book!This was my second Jodi Picoult book and I couldn't put it down. I think Picoult developed the characters well, although I was left with a couple of questions.The book did have a couple of plot twists, like most of her books, and they were clever. I enjoy trying to figure out the twists, and I found this book to be more of a challenge.If you have read and enjoyed Picoult's other novels, you will enjoy this one as well."
4,New Fan,"I had never read any books buy Jodi before and found it quite interesting. Tackling the topic of rape and making the emtions and anger come through are not easy. The comic book aspect was a little annoying, although I do understand the premise behind including it. How the book was tied into Dante's Inferno made for a thought provoking spin. She has found a new fan in me and I look forward to reading more of her efforts."
3,Enjoyable,"I enjoyed the book on some level, but it didn't have a very strong ending. It seemed like Picoult got bored of writing, and decided to end it. Other than that, it was a good read."
3,"Not bad, but not my favorite Jodi","Jodi Picoult is by far my favorite author. I love everything she has written. The Tenth Circle is not my favorite of her books. Though I would reccommend it over most other best sellers, I wouldn't recommend it over any of her other books. If this is your first time reading Jodi, I'd recommend you try her others, they are much better."
3,Just an okay book,"I was looking for a new author to become obsessed with and a friend recommended Jodi Picoult. I read one of her books called Perfect Match and I greatly enjoyed it. So, I bought this book along with the Pact. So far, I am disappointed. This book was a bit boring and without the wow factor I got from her other novel. It seemed as if the whole comic book theme was not integrated well into the story and you had to keep going back and forth between the two. Also, the characters you end up not caring much about. I will try one more of her books hoping that this was the only disappointment in the bunch."
3,"Love you, Jodi, but this is a bit disappointing!","I, like so many others, am an avid Jodi Picoult fan. I will continue to buy and read her books, period. But...while The Tenth Circle is fairly riveting and full of Jodi's trademark interesting research tidbits...it is both highly predictable and certainly less than believable. The graphic novel piece seems a bit gimmicky, too. An adventure in teen angst that will wring out most parents (especially of teen girls!), this book is frighteningly realistic at times, but mostly too melodramatic and unlikely to swallow. Recommended only for die-hard Picoult devotees!"
2,Another Dysfunctional Family...,"East, West, Muslim or Christian, this book proves the rule that the majority of abusive-slash-dysfunctional families are basically the same. While Living in Hell rides on the recent wave of first person accounts of Iran written by women, it falls far short of their benchmark.Mildly sensationalist, most of the book is one, (yawn) long, intensely detailed, lament about an abusive and deprived childhood and young adulthood, exacerbated by repressive cultural conditions. It is, however, interspersed with occassional interesting and colorful bits about Persian history, folklore, costume and architecture. Unfortunately, this book is dominated by the author's extremely narrow social outlook (which living in Canada has not overcome) and completely subjective view of her country and history.Possibly good reading for college level, social studies students. Or for those who enjoy long, rambling, weepy stories.As a counterpoint I highly recommend reading Lipstick Jihad instead."
3,Nice meaning behind the information but.......,"But, what I did not like so much about the book, was that it was too wordy like a previous reviewer mentioned, and that I personally feel that Belleruth kept repeating herself over, and over, and over again.... After a while, it really got to be sorta over worded, too much repeating.... I think she had great ideas, and the meaning of the open heart etc was Great! I would give the book alltogether 3 stars, but I would Give the inductions/excercises in the book 5 stars! The inductions/excercises were terrific, very heart opening, but too much of the same info was being repeated unfortunetly."
3,Seiko #SNA410,"Not so hot. Alarm is so faint that it is more of a joke.Appearance is so,so. Not the easiest to read the time as the dial is busy."
4,better price,"I found this at a tourist place and decided that I needed it, but not at the price in the tourist store. Interesting reading. A friend is a realtor in Tacoma, and has found a few of the Sears homes up there. It's a good book for when you have some time to kill, but don't want to get wrapped up in a novel."
4,Saturday Morning Fears,"I have to disagree with the previous reviewer. ""Gnelfs"" is a solid book, though I did Like Williams' ""Blood Hunter"" and ""Night Brother"" better. ""Gnelfs"" is told, in part, from the point of view of a very young child, a girl named Heaven who is only four and a half. People who have difficulty putting themselves into the mind of such a young one may have trouble with this book. Personally, I loved that quality. ""Gnelfs"" is a story about what happens when a saturday morning cartoon gets out of hand. It's an original story with some genuinely frightening moments. I recommend it."
1,The worst book I've ever read!,Don't waste your time or money on this book. The plot is stupid and the characters are hollow and unbelievable. I had no sympathy for the main characters. Save the money from the price of the book and pay a bill or something. It will be more entertaining
4,"good product,","the product is very good, but the wireless speed is not good for videos, but for power point its perfect"
3,hey guys another fifa game within 6 months!!!!!!,"ok its the basically the same game as fifa rtfwc. its ridiculas. EA whips out darn sports games 20 times a year and ppl still buy them THEY ARE ALL THE SAME. This one still has the horrible AI that Road had and the graphics are not improved. Why are the other versions 30$ and the xbox 360 version 60$ explain to me Ea why u create the same games over and over again and dont change a da#n thing? Example, madden...nba live. they are all the same. dont buy this, its the same as road to fifa."
3,"Really, the sun stops shining at night?","This is a great little book, but the examples leave something to be desired.The suggestion in the ""It must make sense"" section that the Sun is not shining at night is ludicrous and wrong... I don't understand how this made it into the book. The sun can shine for months at night depending on your location (distance from polar circle). Actually, it always shines, even at night, but you can't see it because the earth gets in the way. Of all the examples of ""logical"" thought, this is the best the author could come up with. It just doesn't make sense :-)Similarly, I find the ""Keep it simple"" (occam's razor) example quite weak as well. How is gravity (and the ill-advised definition in this book for kids) any simpler than invisible birds? Why is gravity not questioned the way the invisible birds are. Perhaps the author should have kept it simple himself, and used an example of some 'certainty' a kid is already familiar with."
2,worst game ever!,this game is so stupid! please save yourslef the 50 bucks of complete pointlesness! the only reason i didnt give it 1 star is because of the online play. its the only +.Pros:Online playCons:everything elseplease do not buy this game
1,auto modellista,This is the absolute worst game i have ever played. I also feel that it totally ruins the online experience. Whoever made this game should really consider another line of work. If you want a good game go get SOCOM navy seals. Best game they ever made.
1,Motor stops working after a few weeks,"This swing would be great if the motor worked. On the swing levels 1 and 2 it has issues, will stop working and slows down. We called customer service and they sent us a new motor. That one worked fine for awhile but now it is having the same problem. Guess I will make a second call to them...how frustrating. SO overall this swing works fine for awhile but will most likely have motor problems."
1,does NOT vibrate,"We purchased this swing because it vibrated for our daughter. The review said it vibrated and the Lovin Hug Swing listed on the ToysRus website (not in pink, the neutral one)also said it vibrated. The swing came and it did not come with the part that vibrates and attaches to the front of the seat, it wasnt even listed in the instruction manual. We had to return it and go to ToysRus to get the swing.If you are purchasing this swing becuase it vibrates do not!"
1,Woah! this was bad !,"This was the worst book Nora Roberts has ever written, and the other entries were just as bad. I'm still amazed a week after throwing this away. Whewh!"
5,Almost As Good As Neville,"Joseph Murphy and Neville Goddard were both taught by the same person. I am a big fan of Neville and so I wanted to look into Murphy as well.This is a really good book. It takes a different tack than Neville. Murphy is more analytical than Neville and offers many examples. Some of Murphy seems a bit outdated and perhaps a bit too enthusiastic. But, it is almost always best to read the original. He and Neville are both labeled as New Thought or as New Thinking.I'll be honest. I like Neville a lot more. Neville is more poetic and more inspirational. And, to me Neville is more practical.Whatever floats your boat. You can't go wrong with either if you are open to a new way of thinking, new even though this is a 1963 book."
4,Always informative,"Joseph Murphy has a wonderfully easy way of conveying information in his writings. I feel that he is to the point in making everything understandable. In The Power of the Subconscious Mind, he brings to light how our thoughts make our life experience what it is. What we believe, we achieve, whether negative or positive. We attract to us what we send out to the Universe. So, if we don't like how our lives are going, we must change our thoughts to correspond with what we want instead. Easy to read, easy to apply. I read this book many years ago and have proven over and over how to apply its teachings. I lost my copy and purchased a new one so that I could re-read it. I am a spiritual counselor and his teachings are wonderful to use in helping others to over come their situations. I have given this book to several people, who have discovered a new way of thinking, thus a better way of living."
1,typos galore,"This publication of this book has an unreal number of mistakes. It is really not fit to be sold. The original publication of this book did not have the errors - so they have created errors. The paper and cover are of nice quality, and the size of the type set is pleasing."
4,The Power of Your Subconscious Mind,"It is a must read for anyone seeking success in the many spheres of human life. The pages of this book are filled with valuable concepts, ideas and examples of how we can program ourselves painlessly and effectively to achieve our objective in life.I recommend this book to any student of life. Young and old. To read these pages not once but many times. Because many of the ideas are hidden and do not reveal themselves to the reader on the first read, reading it more than once becomes the gift that keeps on giving."
5,"Understanding the Meaning of life, that there is no meaning.","I now feel an inner peace after reading this book. I feel in unison with everyone. It has made me understand that we are all part of the one Spirit and that we truly hold great powers. Life has no meaning, it just is."
3,This seems to be a different book!,"When I read this book 18 years ago or so it left a powerful impression. I still use the methods quite effectively, and at that time I often had a lot of success with them. However, recently buying and re-reading it, it seems to be quite a different book. There is a lot more biblical content, certain stories don't figure at all, and it just isn't as accessible or catchy. Was it really totally revised and when? WHY? And does anyone know where I can get an unrevised copy.... or is it my bad memory? There were some very inspirational angles I enjoyed, which are now lacking. This book does not seem to offer what the original did..."
4,Simple and Powerful,"This is a must read for everyone. It has a powerful yet simple message that the power lies in your subconscious mind on whatever you want to accomplish or bring into your life whether it is inspiration, health, courage, wealth, peace, motivation, success or love. It tells you that your negative thoughts are the only thing between you and your achievement and gain of all of the above. Joseph Murphy gives great personal stories, stories of his clients, lectures and simple explanations of ideas and he understands what the average person usually thinks about different situations. He offers steps to achieving it all. This book will change your life and put you on the right path to freedom to gain anything you want. The only criteria is you must desire the things you want badly enough to want to exercise the power of your subconscious mind."
2,Expected More Interesting Book,"After reading all reviews, I decided to buy it. The book was rather disappointing. The book tends to say the same thing over and over and it requires rather common magical thinking."
5,Like it!,It promotes a good understanding of how subconscious mind works. I enjoyed reading it. This book is one of the books that I want to re read.
1,Just a list of all chapters in the book,"I did not realize this product was just a list of all the chapters in Joseph Murphy's book, The Power of Your Subconscious Mind. I returned this and was charged a $10.00 fee for returning the item which I think is totally horrible."
3,At Least The Crab Was Funny,"I'm not sure if the reviewer Mr. Buttersworth was being ironic or is mentally unbalanced. This stuff is ANYTHING but High Art. I don't doubt Ms. Bradford is a very nice person and a friend to all. She also appears in the ""Belle's Sing Me A Story"" tapes from Disney. Her performance in this video and the Disney projects is 100% average. With memorable lines such as ""Way to go"" and ""Yeah, you can't give up now"", her part could be played by any random kid from the block. She MAY be the 2nd coming but you'd never know it from this work. If you buy the tape, be advised that it's aimed at not-very-picky preteens and that the puppet crab playing the Sea Captain is a real hoot. In fact there's some real nice puppet work thoughout and it's the best part of the show. Is it worth a couple of bucks and 30 minutes of your life? Immediate family members of the cast would probably say YES!...For everybody else it's a wash"
5,Living every birder's dream,"Kingbird Highway is a book that captures the imagination of birders certainly, but it is also a travel book and an excellently written narrative of a young man's journey into his passion and himself. The adventures and excitement of Kenn Kaufman's quest for his Big Year are presented in a captivating style that urges the reader to continue reading on into the night. Unfortunately, it's one of those books where you start to slow down toward the end because you just don't want your relationship with this story and this young man to be over. Kingbird Highway is one of the few books that I plan to re-read -- more than once!"
5,Instrumental in My Recovery,This book was instrumental in my recovery during and after divorce. It was given to me by a coworker who had read it and found it most helpful. I had no idea that verbal abuse was this prevalant in our society. The book really helped me gain insight into my ex husband and consistently provided me with reassurance that I made the right decision to leave the relationship. Please consider purchasing The Verbally Abusive Relationship for yourself or for someone you love. I am buying a third copy to give to a coworker whose sister is just emerging from a toxic relationship. This book was the key that opened the door to my new life.
4,"Haven't Finished this, but so far, it's really accurate!","Hi. Bought this on recommendation of someone who has read it. So far, it's right on target. I have already learned what part I play in the continuation of the problem and also that I am also guilty of not being super nice all the time either! So, I think it was well worth the investment."
5,great book,Super fast shippingas the book came faster than expected. It was like brand new. I gave it as a gift so I hope they understand the messaging. Easy reading and very profound.
2,wait for the movie or give it to the kids...,The definitive biography of Janet Renos tenure as the firstwoman US attorney-general has yet to be written. Hopefully it will bewritten by the lady herself before she succumbs to the parkinsons disease which has been her close companion these last few years. The inside facts on the Waco debacle and of course the Elian Gonzales incident. Give this one a miss or else give it to the kids.
3,Deming Review,"The new economics was a great book to read, however it was very repetitive. Deming thinks that the current system we are in needs to be changed because its individual based, and needs to be changed to more of a team approach. He wants to get rid of the grading system because it prevents those who have low grades from becoming better because of humiliation. I thought it should be a book for everyone to read not just those in the statistics field.Furthermore, I thought that Deming brought too much of his personal life into the book. Almost half of the book was just about him and his wife and their personal problems."
5,Waited so long,"A few years ago I was saying how much I missed the familiar guitars, beats, and sounds -- and hearing them in new ways. Granted, after Disintegration I wandered away from the Cure, thinking they had finally sold out (Bloodflowers delightedly proved me wrong). For anyone who has memorized (almost) all Cure songs available to the human ear (in one form or another), you have got to get this. It's a blissful revisiting of the past, and a deft mix for the future."
3,Go to Napster and buy the whole thing for $10,"I really really love this album. With that said, you must be wondering why I'm giving it 3 stars. Well ... the entire first disc of b-sides is amazing, while the other 3 quickly dive from ""ho-hum"" to the point where you're scrapping the barrel for good tracks.... AND this would have gotten 5 stars if it were the first (essential) disc for only $10. After breaking the first disc, I pondered whether or not to buy the whole thing new. And then I found it on Napster for $10; think of it as a ""great b-side album from 3IB - Head Cure + 3 bonus discs.""Yay!"
5,"FANTASTIC 4 CD BOX SET FROM THE KING OF ""GOTH"" ROCK!!!","GREAT BOX SET PERIOD!!! This box set contains 4 cd's of B-sides, rarities, and previouly unreleased material. It also contains a booklet inside, that explains the songs,and a message from Robert Smith. There are some great songs in this set, including some different versions of some songs previously released, plus, there are some ""Cure"" versions of some Jimi Hendrix's songs. If you like the ""Cure"", this is a must have CD box set!!!"
3,It works but they could do better,Pros- Compact and looks good.- Easy installation with provided screws- Appears sturdy enough to prevent prying open.Cons- Instructions for setting the combination are poor- Any sequence of the combination will open the lock- Need to hold the open button while removing the key or re-set the combination to close cover
3,Stinks,"While I was impressed with the condition of my dogs coat after a couple of uses, the product stinks incredibly bad with what I would call a 'skunky' smell. I used this about half-way through and tossed it. The smell of washing my dog gagged me too much."
3,Clean inside,"The inside of this book is very clean, but the book is not very stable. Some corners are abraded. But these are not important, I focus on the contents."
1,First book I have never finished,"This is the first book I never finished. It is also the first book I have ever thrown out rather then sell back to half Priced Books.I purchased it for 3$ and it was so bad, I had to actually find the book to review it, and have thrown the book out to keep another from reading it.I realize this may actually draw the curious, but you have been warned."
3,Interesting but long,"The Book was well written with a lot of explaining,but too long paragraphs to catch the attention andalso to follow this type of loving concepts.Interesting but a bit long and with few pictures.Still a good book to read and ponder over."
2,nope,Way too short. I guess if ur looking for sumthn like to read n quickly before intamacy. It has no like hints or topical information.
1,Warning: Pornographic - not for family fun,"I accidently bought this game for my family to play. Yikes! We got it out and there are recommendations for ""role play"" dares such as ""clothed lap dance with person of same sex"". Yuck. Filled with drinking and nudity jokes. I put it in the trash. Figured it was one less game in circulation."
3,Totally Disgusting Fun!,"I was surprisingly a little disappointed. I usually can handle anything, but it was so disgusting I could hardly read some without gagging. Many were the same concept, but with different gross object i.e. pus, snot, etc. We found it more fun to just read through the cards than try to play the game. All in all, if you like the grossness, its really fun, otherwise, get the original."
4,Fun for awhile,I bought this game because I heard about it on Bob and Tom. At first it was alot of fun but some of the questions seem to keep repeating in some way or another. Still very funny though I do get alot of good laughs.
4,Not a family game,"This is a fun game for adults. Bought it for a Christmas present, and they said they loved it, and had a great time with it."
1,Disconnected,"This book doesn't know what it wants to be when it grows up. The first half rambles on personal life, the second half preaches on public affairs, and the whole thing peters out in a dull ending."
3,disappointing effort,"I finished this book with a vague feeling of disappointment. The first half of the book is the best, detailing Cronkites early experiences in the war. The last half loses steam. Would have benefitted from a co-writer to polish some chapters"
5,A good book by the best news man ever!,"I've always been a big fan of Walter Cronkite (I even got to meet and interview him while I was in college), but I wasn't sure what to expect from this book. I was not disappointed. Cronkite takes the reader through his start in journalism and through all of the important events that he reported on while serving as managing editor of the CBS Evening News. He does jump around a little bit, but that is a very, very minor complaint.What I like most about the book is that Cronkite is honestly and genuinely modest. If there ever was a news man that would have cause to brag and take stock in his accomplishments in a high-handed manner, it's Cronkite, but he does not at all. Uncle Walter writes his book like he conducted his broadcasts - he just tells it like it is. This is a wonderful book not only for newshounds and journalism aficionados, but also for anyone who would like to read about a figure of Americana. Highly recommended."
1,Did Not Work,"Extech MO100 did not work. It was tested against two other professional instruments and did not provide anywhere near the correct reading. It was returned and a refund was made. While the product did not work, returning it and receiving a refund went very smoothly and I am pleased with their willingness to deal fairly."
4,Too expense,"The toy was great, my son loves it but the site I brought it from sold everything too expense. I was shopping around and I saw all of the items 50% less then what I brought for. Everything I saw was not on sale and when it was it was even cheaper."
5,Brewer is the Devilfish Boy,"The most underrated book of poetry of 1999. Read it . Brewer is a master of the dark phrase, the tough-as-hell line, the chiseled image. Every poem is a surprise here, an antidote to the status quo of the poetry scene."
5,Nice Biblical Research Tool,Great tool for understanding why things are related as they are.nnnnnnnnnn nnnnnnnnn nnnnnnnnn nnnnnnnnnnnnn nnnnnnnnnnnnnnn nnnnnnnn nnnn nnnnn nnnnn nnnnn
5,Xenosaga: One of the best games this year,"This game is amazing in all areas. First, it has 50 hours+ gameplay,although there is alot of CGS and story telling. Next the Grapics use about all the power of the PS2 and in my opinion surpasses that of the X-Box. Lastly the story is alluring even though there is alot of twists and mystories surrounding KOS-MOS, the girl on the cover art, who is an android in a time when androids are considered a little archic and old technology, and there are many more mysteries surounding the entire party. This game is a must buy for all PS2 gamers as well as anyone who is into RPG/actions or just the general player."
2,Not worth it...,"I bought this game due to how much hype was behind it's origin, Xenogears, and due to the advertised hours of gameplay and great story. I was extremely wrong.The game has terrible play with a very dull, very long story. It takes around 10 hours just to get INTO the game, and to be able to actually DO anything. Some may say just to buy it to see a great ""movie-game"", but it would not even qualify for that. The ""cutescenes"" are non-cinematic and are much too long to keep your interest.The only thing GOOD I would say about the game is the fact that it keeps stupid gamers busy playing it while the more sophisticated, real gamers are talking about (and playing) the REAL games."
5,Great game,This is a great game and the service was very quick.The write up amazon provided is exactly what my brother told me about the game before I bought it.He has been playing this game since it came out. I am very happy with my purchase. Thanks again Amazon
3,Great RPG for any RPG gamer,"First off, this game has the MOST cut scenes I have ever seen in one game. The good news is, you can skip them if you like. Other than the extremly long cutscenes, the game is great.This game is you basic turn based rpg which I rather enjoy. Gives me time to figure out what my next move will be. The enemies appear on your map so you always know if you're going to run into one. The enemies don't just pop up when you're walking around. I like that. Anyway, the characters are wonderful along with the graphics. Voice work couldn't have been better.You learn cool techniques that you can even have your other team members learn. You can also transform into the really big machines(been a while since I've played it, I don't remember what they are called) but it's awesome.The side quests in the game are really fun also.This games is really a must for any RPG lover. IF you can sit throught all the cutscenes and not get discouraged, this game is really great."
3,Not Bad but not indepth to take you far.,This was a good start to php but I found that at the end of it I had a working web site but a lot of what was done was not explained. It leads you step by step but doesn't tell you the why behind it. If you want something more advanced to take you deeper this is not the book for you.
1,Keep Looking,"I haven't finished the book yet -- and probably won't. It is absolutely the most dreadful development/learning book I've come across yet (in almost 30 years of playing with computers). Some instructions are missing steps. Others are plain flat-out wrong. Finally, the authors make way too many assumptions about users' abilities and machine-specific setups. Do yourself a favor and find another book."
1,"All windows, No Mac","If your doing development on a Mac, this book is NOT for you. I started reading the intro chapter 1, which did mention how to configure PHP on Mac OSX, but when i got to chapter 2, installing and configuring MySQL, everythign was windows related. So that leaves me with a worthless book. Ive been workign with HTML and Flash for a few years and really want to start using the dynamic aspects of site development instead of hiring out every time i need PHP or server tech done. On my own again...."
3,Protector collar,It's quality made but wouldn't recommend it for big dogs. My rottweiler is only a year and a half and can't even wear the biggest size they have. The spikes are pointy so if you plan on leaving it on all the time I would suggest a softer spike. Other than this I would recommend it to someone that has a dog that's fully grown and make sure you add some inches to it b/c it is shorter than stated!
3,Spine Aligner,"The Spine Aligner is a fair product, it seems to work better one other parts of the body then the back.It slips when you are using it on the floor, but rolling it the legs works great."
1,Poor Design,"The first thing I noticed when I tried out the Maxi Backsie was that it pressed hard against my spine, which I consider very bad, esp. for the lower spine. I wouldn't want to whittle it down, either, because there would not be enough wood to withstand much weight and it's made of two pieces. I'm quite thin; maybe a fat man wouldn't mind the pressure."
1,Didn't match picture,"The item I received did not match the picture shown on the site at the time I ordered (and the time of this review). The item pictured has rubber rings on the ends of the roller and smooth, angled slopes from edge to inner track. The item I received had no rubber rings and a ridged flat slope from edge to inner track. Consequently, the roller I received slipped easily and after several uses the ridged portion began to cut my back. Home Naturals Inc.'s customer service rep was polite, but not terribly helpful. Amazon's customer service rep was fantastic though and resolved things to my satisfaction. I subsequently ordered theBody Back Company Back Rollersold through Amazon directly (which has the exact same item pictured for a couple of bucks more - unsurprisingly Amazon actually sent the item pictured instead of a poor substitute ;-) which I've found to work very nicely."
5,A great functioning belt pack,"I was a little leery of buying this product because it's made of neoprene. I wondered how sturdy it would be. Ultimately, it has worked out great. Easy to adjust, the stretchy-ness of the neoprene makes it comfortable to wear, and it's easy to load the player into it. I'm really pleased with it."
5,Just right,I love the ability to exercise and keep a bulkier music player safely inside the carrier. I recommend it to anyone.
1,Tune Belt CD Carrier,"The way carrier was described appeared just right for my needs. When item arrived, the only person it would fit in my family was my 7 year old son, who had no idea what it was and didn't want anything to do with it. Misleading advertisements do no one any good especially merchants pushing things like this."
1,NOT ORIGINAL RECORDINGS,I waited a month to get this CD only to find out that they are Newly Recorded songs and NOT the Originals. A waste of money...
2,Don't Waste Your Time,"This isn't really a ""book"" as much as it is just some brief articles and bulleted points thrown together. It keeps referring you to the author's website, [...], which in turn tells you to buy this book for more detailed information. There is no detailed information, it's just a quick reference to a lot of information that has already been written about elsewhere, better, and in more detail. Don't waste your time. Definately not worth the money."
3,Not Recommendable,With the pace that updates are introduced to RealStudio this book too far out of date to be helpful. Anyone transitioning from VB Studio will find it somewhat helpful. Novices will not find this helpful.
4,Good Examples...,"When I purchased this book at a B&M, I was somewhat concerned after I read the reviews on this site. I decided to read the book and make my own judgements. Boy, I'm glad I did. The book has many good examples, and aside from the mistake in code for chapter 3 (the only reason it didn't get 5 stars), I think it does a good job of teaching REALbasic.Would definitely recommend it."
2,Disappointing,"This book reads like an extended high school term paper. Some of the biographies could qualify for an entry to the wikipedia- others barely merit an entry in a bibliography...for a high school term paper. The illustrations are inked by the same undistinctive hand- which is rather sad and occasionally pathetic. The absence of context- the absence of variety, the absence of flavor all make for a very dull and uniforming ""encyclopedia"" indeed. I shudder to think of the school papers that will be written using this book as source material.Are the authors and editors that worked on this project so uninspired by this field?"
5,Great health info,This book is a great book that overviews a fantastic technique that can eliminate illnesses due to allergies. A must read for persons searching for answers to unexplained illness that their medical providers haven't been able to cure...or people who look first for complimentary ways to address illness.
3,He came a long way from this album to his Pink Floyd days.,Not very impressed at all. I love him with Floyd but could do without this disc.The seller was great and ship as stated just didn't care much for the album as a whole.Some do love it but just not me.
5,One of the best books I've ever read,"Kiyosaki has written a page-turning guide to investing, purhcasing real estate, getting wealthy, etc. He challenges you to think and shed your old restricting thought processes, and he shares with you new opportunities. They are so profound yet so simple that you will wonder why we were never taught these strategies when we were younger. Even after years of college and further education, we are still not taught these techniques by our traditional educational system.Read this book. Your mind will be changed forever, and so will your pocketbook. I have already taken the necessary steps to begin amassing my wealth--thanks in great part to Kiyosaki's philosophies."
4,Good book with simple truths that really motivate.,"A previous review questions why the author would be peddeling books, seminars, games etc. if he were so rich. Here's another question: Why would Bill Gates still be selling software? There's more to earning money than just reaching a certain point--like $1 million. Once you get in the swing of things you want to keep going. The simple truths in this book can change your live if you apply them. Finding great deals has always been tough, but then again so are most things that pay handsome rewards. One thing is for sure, if you don't try, you'll never make it. If you do, you have a chance. If you give it ALL you've got, you'll make out just fine. S.R.S."
3,born to do business,"... but most people doesn't born so. Most people, when looking at land, sea, a mountain, a lake or a building sees only the shape, colour, size...But there exists between us a few people which don't see the same things as the majority of us or at less I think so. But don't forget, they are few. One of these rarely clever persons is Mr. Kiyosaki. His book doesn't contains complicate ideas. By the contrary, these are very easy to understand (to put in practice is another thing), but I believe he, when looking at a house or a terrain doesn't see nothing of the anterior qualities: instead he see dollars, or euros if you want, this is cash, and that is a talent that can be perfected if you have a natural ability for business, but not practicable with success by everybody. Mr. Kiyosaki has demonstrated how he's worth in making money between other facts in selling thousands of copies of this book, but how many people has attained to get rich after reading? I think very few."
3,rich dad,"Be careful if you decide to order any books or tapes directly from the auther's office when you see an ad in his book, which says that you only need to pay a few dolloars for handling fee!!! (It is much better to buy from Amazon[.com] or a bookstore even with paying more.) I did about 2 years ago, and the tapes I paid for handling fee are still not here! Please let me if anyone here has the same experience like my. I wonder if it was an innocent mistake or a way to make $$$.I gave 3 stars for the valiable lesson I learned."
4,Good Motivational/ Reference Tool,"If you want a motivational tool to assist you in overcoming financial illiteracy, advice on what to do with money once you make it, how to keep people from taking money from you, how to make your money work for you and see how highly educated professionals get locked into the rat race...this book is for you.I saw Robert T. Kiyosaki on Oprah discussing this book. I purchased the book days after the interview. This is a book that you want to purchase extra copies for your friends and loved ones that do not have six figure incomes. You will not want to loan your copy out and you may want to have a highlighter handy once you begin reading it.If you are a person that makes a six figure salary...this book is NOT for you (you should already know the basic financial principles, have a financial planner and accountant) unless you just want to add it to your resource library and write it off on your taxes."
1,useless catchphrases,"This book has some pretty interesting stories, but nothing you can really use to get wealthy yourself. It seems like the author just thought of 5 or 6 catchphrases and repeated them over and over without really telling you how to make them work. They might be good in theory, but he does not show you how to apply them to your life.Whether or not the stories in here are true, you won't be able to use them as examples, because the circumstances were so rare and specific that you'll never have the opportunity.If you want to read some interesting stories on how one person made money, it's an ok book. But if you want actual advice on how to get there yourself, it seems like the only lesson is to create an overhyped book and convince other people to buy it"
4,Thought provoking approach to finance and a quick read,"This is a very quick, enjoyable read. This book focuses on an issue I had never really thought about: breaking the cycle of working at a job for a living. Ironically, he recommends you do just that while you start your own business on the side.He does brag about some of his investments even though he says he doesn't mean to. He also has some ""unique"" and speculative investing strategies like tax receipts. But the focus of this book should be on changing the cycle of living up to your salary and instead saving money for investing. He is a conservative man who leverages his winnings, evidently quite successfully. Should be required reading for all college graduates and is the next present for my daughter."
4,One of the Best Personal Finance Books Available,"""Rich Dad, Poor Dad"" is always one of the first books I recommend to my financial planning clients. By contrasting the financial principles he was taught by his rich dad to those of his poor dad, Kiyosaki manages to teach his reader the secrets of effective money management in an easy to understand and entertaining manner. Although Kiyosaki does make several specific recommendations, his primary emphasis is on general principles of creating wealth rather than the ""how-to"" approach of other books. The book also offers a large motivational benefit for anyone with an entrepreneurial interest. The one flaw in this book is that Kiyosaki advocates a relatively high-risk approach to money management that may not be suitable for every reader."
1,Are you kidding?,"The reason this book was so cheap is because the book is only two inches by two inches. I don't recall the size of the book being anywhere on the product description. Don't see the point of the book, they left out about half of the content."
4,Bestselling for a reason.,"This book gives a brand new perspective on how to view money in general. I recommend everyone to read this book.But whilst this book gives great insights into how the rich thinks and works, the writing itself is pretty bad. The author sometimes tell long stories that seem almost irrelevant to the point, making the reading sometimes tedious.Also, the book is fairly vague in its ideas. Although it tells you how to think like the rich, it doesn't even give you examples of how they accomplished their success.But like the author says, you don't have to write a ""best writing book,"" you just need to write a ""best-selling book"". The book is a great way to start your journey to better manage your wealth."
1,Poor Author -> Rich Author,"In 2004, Mr. Kiyosaki made lecture tours in Asia. In Hong Kong, thousands attended his lecture. The ticket price for the event was a toweing 2500 Chinese dollars, which was the equivalent of 250 US Dollars! The audience came out of the lecture largely disappointed. Most claimed it was a superficial event, in which Mr. Kiyosaki bragged about his own success as an author and povided almost no valuable insight into anything else.While we are enjoying the book Rich Dad, Poor dad. Mr. Kiyosaki is certainly enjoying his climb to the top with outrageously priced worthless lectures...The guy deserves a hand of applause"
1,Not worth it,I don't understand why people recommend this book. It is filled with useless information. Throughout the book I kept waiting for a useful tip. This book wasn't worth my time.
2,Simplistic,"Some interesting philosophies. I couldn't agree more that people live beyond their means by adjusting their spending to their income. Basically we do not save enough in an effort to keep up with the Joneses. I am not sure I needed a book to tell me that.As far as his advice, I felt like I was reading an infomercial about buying and leveraging real estate. Works if you know that you are doing and the timing is right, but taking your savings and leveraging it into a downpayment on a distressed piece of real estate is marginal investment advice at best. In the next downturn many foreclosure companies are bound to make a mint if people follow this advice. It is kind of like doubling your bet everytime you win in Vegas. It can make you tremendously wealthy until the inevitable time when you lose and there is nothing left."
4,A Little Redundant,The author repeats himself too much. Overall the book has some good insights. Of course buying and reading this book will only make the author rich. It is a good starting point for those of us that have had bad financial training throughout our lives.
1,This is pure blather...,"Save your money! Whatever you pay for this book is probably too much. It is full of useless rhetoric, and appears to be written at a very low level. It is full of examples which just seem to farfetched to be believed."
5,Great book,"Very good advice. The first two chapters were slow for me, so I jumped to chapter 3 and read from there. After I finished reading to the end, I jumped back to chapters 1 and 2 to get the background information. Good solid advice about personal finance. I enjoy Robert's explanations of financial concepts. I purchased a copy of this book for my brothers and friends."
4,Kiyosaki is a genius,"This is not the type of book I would read. I had to read it for an assignement. Kiyosaki speaks to everyone, not matter what your age is. Reading it now, I feel like I could be a millionaire by the age of 27. Its definitely something I would teach my kids, from the school aspect of it to the taxes. Read it, it will give you great knowlege which you could use for the rest of your life!!!"
1,Not worth the money,Basically he says prepare for the future and know how to find get rich quick schemes. That's it. The rest of the book is just filler.
1,So little offered,Not worth the time really. I was given the book or would not have otherwise read it. I found many words with very little actually being said.Wealthy Barber at least gets you pointed safely in the right direction without filling your head with dreams of wealth and power untold.
1,I thought that I would learn something valuable. I found the book quite disappointing.,"I thought I would give this book a try since it appeared to get good reviews. Unfortunately, I would not recommend this book to anyone."
5,"Easy to read, digest and motivates!","I am a middle class small business owner. Although I am not a paycheck to paycheck employee (which this book is mainly targeted toward), I did get a huge wakeup call with this book. I am now committed to investing in income producing assets to gain financial freedom. This book discusses financial freedom in a way that cannot be ignored. I recommend another book, Optimal Thinking--How to Be Your Best Self as a companion to this book. In my opinion, Optimal Thinking is the Think and Grow Rich of this millenium. It shows you how to make the most of your mind and create the best possible results in any situation."
1,Moderately Interesting,I fell for the TV talk show hype and bought this book. It's not very good although it may have some financial advice buried in it somewhere. The book was hard to read - Kiyosaku is not a professional writer and it shows. It's not clear what his credentials are but maybe the secret to wealth generation is to do what he did and write a book about making money.
2,Don't waste your time or your money on this book!,"This book was recommended at an investment seminar so I checked it out at the library (thank God for libraries!). The one good but certainly not ORIGINAL idea is that you shouldn't work for money but let your money work for you. And that's true, if you have any savings, it's folly to leave them earn 2% somewhere and then be taxed on that ""income."" Anyway, the tone of the book is most irritating and condescending, but there is one part that is extremely telling, when he advises an author to take a sales course if she wants to sell her books. She gets annoyed at him for suggesting such a thing to a litterata, but that's exactly what Kiyosaki has done with his books, he's SOLD them well despite all the drivel. Live and learn..."
1,Scam,"Want to get rich? Write a book about it. This guy doesn't know what he is talking about. I started reading the book and became skeptical to say the least. A quick search on Google will uncover some interesting notes. Check out the link below. If you really want to get on the right path, check out Dave Ramsey or Mary Hunt.http://www.johntreed.com/Kiyosaki.html"
2,Only good if you haven't read anything else,"While this is a pleasant book, the stories are not exactly believable, a little longer than they need to be, and not necessarily applicable to most people's real life.There are better financial management books, real estate books, and 'life philosophy' books."
5,One of the Best Books Ever Read,"This is a wonderful book. Wish I had it before marriage, kids and the such. Life would be so much better, only if I would have heeded to the words at an earlier age, if had the book. But it's never too late. Hey, same thing as the Bible. Apply within and all will go well. For best results follow these instructions."
5,A must read for beginners,"I heard about this book from a friend, I didn't rush out to buy it but I should have. I had no desire what so ever for investing. This book opened my eyes, in the 3 months since finishing ""Rich Dad, Poor Dad,"" I have read 5 more books on investing and purchased a total of 9 more. Soon after finishing the book, I started watching real estate sales and paying more attention to stocks and bonds. When starting the book, I had nothing invested and less then a few hundred saved. Remembering I've only had 3 months since the book reading, I now have $500 in stocks and bonds and have made an unspeakable ammount from real estate purchase and reselling. I had absolutely no motivation for money or investing until I read this book, now it's made me rich."
5,A Lesson That Will Never Cease,"I completely loved the book Rich Dad Poor Dad. This book reveals the major problems with America's financial problems, their lack of intelligence towards the subject. This book will not give people all the answers in getting rich, though it challenges a person to find them out on their own.Brittney Bailey"
5,"Very motivational, life-changing & reality checking","I am 22 years old and I felt that with our ever-changing world of business, wealth and finance that I needed to read this book. I was recommended this by a friend. Although this is controversial among most people, Kiyosaki gives you his thoughts about how he did it and what the reader shall do. This book does not guarantee the reader will get rich, but offers some great ideas (you'll just have to read on!). I was very touched by some of the points that he gave.Okay, now for my gut-spilling: There is speculation stating whether Rich Dad exists. Whether or not he does, this book should still help out the individual! And some believe Kiyosaki is involved with controversial businesses like Amway. Who the heck cares? That is his business, and it doesn't have to be yours. After all, it's not even mentioned in the book."
3,So teach me,"I am still waiting for the lesson. So the guy got lucky by marketing the velcro wallet, and was able to reinvest it wisely. He does point out some obvious blunders people make, but how about how to correct them. The 16% solution, is mentioned in his book, but he doesn't put it in his book recommendations. He promotes his playing game throughout the book, which I perferred he didn't. Overall, it was a fairly decent book, but as for the lesson to be learned, it is not lacking. Your house is your greatest investment, don't ever look at as a liability."
4,Great book for beginners,"You should start reading a book like this to begin your journey in financial world , but it doesn't give you everything to start, so you need to read more books and then start."
1,More comments,I've read this book and come across Kiyosaki on tv as well. All I can say is that I completely back the reviewer who posted before me. I've even decided to investigate Kiyosaki online. A quick web search will quickly deflate the hype that this book is. Save your time and avoid the hype.
4,Listen to the man!,"If people tell ou that this book it useless and that kiyosaki is a loonatic, do NOT listen to them, i mean, a millionare himslef, kiyosaki has experience in these sorts of things and will give you the fianancial know-how in this great little read,Rich Dad, Poor Dad: What the Rich Teach Their Kids About Money--That the Poor and Middle Class Do Not!What he means by poor dad rich dad, is that his poor dad, a friends dad, and also a high school drop out, taught him everyhting that he needs to know about buisness, and that his rich dad is ow becoming one of the ,ost succesfull men in Hawayi.In these controversial financial know-how books, kiyosaki gives you the loadown on buisness, and everyhting about buisness."
2,Could have been said in 20 pages,"Several hundred pages of 'Buy assets. Don't buy liabilities. Go look for good investments rather than sitting around and drinking beer all the time. People who aren't rich are only not rich because they don't choose to be rich, so use them to help you get rich since they won't think for themselves.' It has some useful info, but no more than 20 pages worth."
2,A disappointing read,"This book left me frustrated. It tells all about what you *should* do and *should* get in order to have a cycle of passive income, but does not tell you HOW!Anyone with an interest in finances already knows what they should do and should have. What's the ""down & dirty"" of HOW?"
3,Think and grow Rich?,"I took the book out of the library (as a previous reviewer suggested). There are many how-to-get-rich books in print. All of them seem to take one or maybe two ideas that could be part of an over all strategy and base the whole book on them. This book isn't really any different. It isn't a comprehensive investment guide. It's a couple of good ideas immersed in a great deal of motivation. Motivation is great, but hard facts are what's needed to keep you going after the motivation wears off. This book is scant on them. If you need something to get you going, then great, this is the book for you. If you need something to keep you going (like actual financial advice) after the euphoria of trying to strike it rich wears off, then look for some solid financial planning books."
1,To Be Avoided At All Costs,"I will not waste more space on this work except to say that the review by John Reed at http://www.johntreed.com/Kiyosaki.html sums up everything I might have said. Vague or false statements, espousing the view that the chief goal of education is the amassing of wealth, advocating possibly illegal practices such as insider trading, and contradictory statements sometimes on the same page all point to one conclusion: do not bother with this book or this man's views in any way, shape, or form. There is very sound and intelligent real estate investment advice to be had.....elsewhere."
5,What I should have been taught in school,The financial wisdom in this book is exactly what I have found life has taught me. I echo every thought in it. He's right on.
5,LIFE CHANGING!,"Rich Dad Poor Dad was the BEST book I have ever read. It is a ""must read"" for College Students and people who want to START OVER. Once I picked it up, I just couldn't put it down! The wisdom that he shares with readers is incredible. After reading this book, I also bought Cashflow Quadrant and Rich Dads Guide to Investing. If you want to read a book that will give a new view on life and the difference between the Wealthy and the Poor... READ THIS BOOK! It's not luck, It is a lifestyle that makes the difference. Get in the game. Bye for now, Ray webguy@ipa.net www.goforstuff.com"
5,Beyond the investments hints,"This book is an outstanding and remarkable hit. The style is simple so every kind of reader could understand. The theme is treated with professionalism and a flavour of common sense dominate it. More than investments hints the book try to lead you to overcome work frustrations, finantial crisis and the efects of those problems. The author take the reader and place him into a new context, a one of deal with life. How to invest is not the main point. The strongest point is to develop the power to think about how money can work for people.If you are looking for a book that overcome the traditional style. If you need some kind of advice about how to change your personal finantials problems, learning how to use the common sense. If you want to lear how to think in a powerful way and make things work for you...this is the book. Try it!"
4,Great Book!,Rich people make their money to work for them. Rich people build a portfolio of cash producing assets. You must be willing to take risks to be successful. You need to learn become financially independent.Learn about investing. That is the message in this book and it is very well said.
3,Rich Dad Poor Dad,"The book is good for people who do not think outside the box, despite any income bracket. If you think outside the box, this book is definitely not for you!!!"
5,Rich Dad Poor Dad=Rich Students!,"I have read many books on personal finance and wealth building, but this one by Kiyosaki is the very best. Why? Because it deals with the single most important quality to achieve succe$$;philosophy. How the wealthy think and what makes them different from, well, let's face it, the average and the broke.Like others, I have read those 1,000 page finance books loaded with frivilous information and written by magazine writers who know nothing about how to create wealth and like the others, have been dissappointed and ended up broke and embarrassed.Rich Dad Poor Dad is different and actually delivers on it's promises. If youw ant wealth, read Rich Dad Poor Dad. If you want to continue to be broke and embarrassed, read those ridiculous 1,000 page worthless tomes."
3,It was good,Kiyosaki did an amazing job teaching people about money. He uses simple language and understandable examples that anybody can understand. He has taught me so much about how i can become wealthy. All we need to do is become financial literate and not be scared to take a risk. Most people are scared to lose money and work for money. We must be like the rich and let money make money for us!
2,Save your money,"This book basically tells you to invest in rental property with no real explanation, just buy several houses and rent them out for instant income. Nothing in life is that easy, especially when it comes to making money."
1,just another pep talk,"This book is very overrated! Kiyosaki briefly mentions things like investing in tax liens, but he doesn't say how to do it. The book is 99% pep talk."
1,A forgettable book in a nutshell,"I read this book several years back, and frankly remember very little of it. In a nutshell, the real lesson of the book is that the poor buy necessities (food, clothing, etc.) the middle class buy liabilities (cars, boats, etc.) while the rich buy assets (stocks, bonds, real estate)."
2,Helpful or not?,"This book was a little helpful but honestly I do not think i will use any of his advice. Throughout the book her would just repeat over and over the same things!!! it got kind of boring..But there were some things that he said that made me think of what I spend my money on, and how i can save by making small changes. But overall this book was not as good as i expected."
2,"""POOR"" is all I saw","This book is poorly written and has even worse advice. I will never forgive the friend who highly recommended it! Actually from looking at the other reviews I must be blind because I am obviously in the minority. I will say, if this is your FIRST book on money and personal financial freedom... you probably will do ""okay"" but if you are a guru to these kind of books you could do so MUCH better. I highly recommend The Millionaire Next Door and Motley Fool's - You Have More Than You Think. If you read these and THEN pick up this book you will understand how it pales in comparison. The author here spends most of his time bragging with no real advice for the inexperienced. This is not a ""rags to riches stories"" but instead a riches to bragging story. The goal of this book is to try and sell you the gimmick of a game at the end. Look elsewhere FIRST before you buy this personal finance book!"
4,great book written with great marketing,"I really enjoyed reading this book. It was an easy read with a lot of substance. I have always said ""I need more money."" What I need is a finacial education. Reading this book has helped me change my way of thinking about money and just getting more jobs. I have always wanted to have my own business, but thought it was impossible unless you have lots of money or loans. Robert does mention that 9 out of 10 businesses fail in the 1st year and 9 out of 10 that succeed fail in the 1st 5 years. I knew this already and figured I would never be able to do it, but he points out that the main reason for this is because we have not been taught about money and most people to not know how to successfully manage finacially. I thought there would be more ""how to's"" included in this book, and what it left me with is wanting more information and more of his books. What a great marketing technique! I would love to attend one of his classes/seminars."
4,OUCH! - This probably hits too many folks too close to home,"My husband and I have read both this book and ""Cashflow Quadrant"" and found them common sense guides to personal financial freedom. We have personally followed many of the guidelines presented in this book for years and are continually surprised by the many numbers of people we know(both affluent and struggling)who do not and who feel that being constantly in debt is the ""American way-of-life"". I suspect that those who didn't care for this book found that it hit a little too close to home and made them take a good look into the personal financial mirror. Granted, there are no finely detailed plans for investing and income-growth, but this is a great book to start someone on the track to reviewing their situation and taking the steps necessary to achieve financial freedom. I intend to give copies of both books to family and friends graduating in hopes they can start out on the right financial foot."
3,Why all the bells and whistles ?,"I attended a number(3) of Robert's courses in the mid 80's entitled Money and You/Creating Wealth.This book ties a lot of those ideas together. If Robert is so rich, why the hell is he still flogging seminars,board games, shares in start ups and generally hussling as hard as ever. Something about him does not ring true for me.There is a touch of the ""Amways"" about him that is unsettling"
3,"Rich Dad, Poor Dad review","I personally found the book repetitive in style. The key concepts were actually interesting and worded simply enough for me (a person who is not very knowledgeable about economics and financial matters) to grasp. Because the stories about the lessons were put very simply, the book was not a difficult read, but some of the underlying concepts, as in the ideas beneath the simple words, were a little harder for me to understand. Part of the reason that I find it hard to accept some of what Kiyosaki talks about is that I see people around me falling into the pattern of the rat-race but I can't really understand how wanting to play it ""safe"", in terms of avoiding sudden financial crashes, is necessarily a bad thing. I'm not sure if I like the idea of letting investments run their course in hopes that they bring in money because of the insecurity I attach to investing money in different businesses, stocks, etc."
4,Rich Dad Poor Dad,I truely enjoyed reading this book. I found both of the fathers perspectives on financial situations and wealth extremely interesting and helpful. This book can definately give individuals who do not have any knowledge about money a different outlook on the way that they spend their money and finances. I would recommend this book to all.
1,Fraud Alert,"He's a fraud. Yes I bought the book and curious I did a lot of searching on the Internet. Turns out the ""Rich Dad"" in Hawaii doesn't exit. Also Kiyosaki's real father, the ""Poor Dad"" from his book was very well off. He comes from money and has a ""gift"" for selling his Jibber Jabber to the masses. Just a year or so ago there was a big rift between he and his wife and their partner and the partner told all. He lives in Phoenix (Paradise Valley if I remember correctly), not far from where I live.Honestly, he makes his money from selling gimmicks. Ask yourself, if YOU had the great ""secret"" to financial wealth, why would you bother traveling the country doing the seminar circuit hawking books and board games extolling the principles of wealth generation? If you felt so grateful for that gift of knowledge wouldn't you just want to give it away? Post it all on a website for the world to read?Before wasting your money on another get-rich gimmick, think before you click."
2,Too much filler too little substance,I am not impressed with these rich dad poor dads series. They offer very little practical advice. I would stay away from the whole series. I buy books so I can learn ways to improve my financial situation not finance books for stories. there are a few decent tips in here but overall the book is a waste of paper and kiyoski has been proven a liar and a phoney. go to google and type it in and you will find stuff about him.
2,Adequate book for beginners,"Kiyosaki provides some helpful information in this book. However, he could have summarized the information much more concisely. He spends a considerable amount of time focusing on a few key instructions: acquire assets and not liabilites, make money work for you, don't get caught up in the ""rat race,"" don't waste your time on traditional education, and become financially literate. He does not go in depth with any of these ideas; if you're looking for a how-to book, this one is not for you. Additionally, he supports his ideas about financial success with only moderately interesting and not at all engaging stories from his childhood.Kiyosaki repeats a few select, vague ideas over and over again. For that reason, I cannot recommend the book. It's only redeeming quality is that it does teach something about economics. If you're looking for a general, base-line instruction on how to be rich, this book would be worthwhile."
1,rich dad poor dad BULLSHIT,"Everyone has a long review, but I'll keep this one short...Robert Kiyosaki made his money from this one book because he was on the Oprah show.If it wasnt for that, he would'nt be rich as he is today. Oprah made him."
2,Infomercial Huckster,Robert Kiyosaki is a great marketeer. This is his latest product--a book that has one good idea (buy income generating assets) and repeats it over and over. Kiyosaki's real genius is using this book to push the other products he sells.Here's a free income generating tip from me to all you readers. Write a simplistic book about getting rich and hire Kiyosaki to market it for you. Good luck.
4,Good basic advice,I think this book should be required reading for any parent and even the grown children should probably read it. In my view the advice is a little basic for someone who is experienced in investing and money management however it's still worth a read.
2,Motivation (Hype?) but nothing else....,"This book opens your mind to the educational system flaws and other norms regarding career paths. This book also gets you excited about working for yourself and the ""ownership society"". But I'm afraid it does little else. It provides a lot of hype and tells no details of how to accomplish anything. Stories of making thousands of dollars off forclosures in only hours. Buying luxury cars after purchasing your first rental income property. This sounds more like an infomercial than learning material. If you read this book I recommend you immediately read The Millionaire Mind and The Unofficial Guide to Real Estate Investing. These two books will take your head out of the clouds and give you some good instruction on making money in real estate. Also stop buying books here and get them at your local library. All the new releases are there for free."
3,Dissapointed,"I am an avid reader of personal finance books. I can say after reading this and a few other books on the subject that this one falls flat. Rich Dad Poor Dad has a lot of fans but also a lot of critics, and I'm on the critics side. I lot of the content I felt like wasn't new or innovative. Maybe it's that my expectations were too high, but all in all there's more hype that help in Rich Dad."
5,this book change your mind,This book is owesome.It really change my way of thinking.Robert show us one and the best way to be rich.
3,"Finance 001 ""Light""","I liked his stories, and the idea of his two dads (let me give away what took at least 10 pages for the author to tell us--one of ""his"" dads is really his friend's dad) is a nice twist, but, in all seriousness, this book could have been written in a total of about 10 pages. He basically preaches investing in real estate and making sure you live within your means. Hardly anything new. That said, like a reviewer of the Quadrant book wrote, there is some useful info, and it is a VERY quick read, so it's worth the price, especially for younger investors."
1,99% of this book is a waste of time,"This book contains a lot of nothing, but the author sure likes to talk about himself. His message takes up 1% of the book, and his book is 99% filler. I am a Christian, and I also picked up anti-Christian themes throughout the book. I would not recommend this book for people who love something other than money."
3,"Very Good ""Starter Book"" on Financial Knowledge","Rich Dad Poor Dad gives the readera really good foundation of financial knowlegde.I gave this book 3 stars because while it teaches you solid foundational financial knowledge, it fails to give ""YOU"" a ""game-plan""After reading this book, I felt inspired to write a book that shows you ""everything"" you need to know, to go from Broke to Billionaire. My book is titled ""Pennies to Billions"". My advise, read Rich Dad, Poor Dad to get the foundational knowldge, then pick up my book and learn the steps to take, and the ""stages"" to go through, to create a perfect financial plan for yourself, to create unlimited wealth!"
2,"Same story, different author","This book was purchased after a friend recommend I take a look at it. After the first few pages, I became a little bored. The book appeared to be more along the lines of what a motivational speaker would present to people who pay ridiculous amounts for the obvious. There may be something in it for someone, but for me, I didn't find anything that I didn't learn (just about on my own) through general life experiences. By the way, I had to stop reading it half-way through.If you need help putting your thoughts into perspective, it might be good to read. Otherwise, use that money for a subscription to Fortune magazine."
4,"Very worth while reading, but . . . . .","Like Kiyosaki, I retired financially in my mid-forties after making money by creating and running my own business while, in parallel, investing in real estate. Understanding money and how to make it is key to financial independence and Kiyosaki's advice is very valuable. However, hanging onto it once made is just as serious a business. Kiyosaki (and others) seem blind to the INEVITABLE massive depression looming just a few years down the line that is going to blindside so many and rob them of their money and assets. Read THE GREAT BUST AHEAD by Daniel Arnold too (still an Amazon strong seller for over a year it seems - a book's best recommendation), and marry this with Kiyosaki's advice. Together you will have a good closed end set of advice for both making (although there are now precious few years left to make it), and then not losing your net worth."
1,tiny book!,"The book I received was tiny, almost joke like. I would have never ordered this book if I knew the actual size of it. It was actually quite ludacris. Do not order the miniature version, you’ll be extremely disappointed. The seller didn’t make it clear that the book was a miniature. Very disappointed!I would not recommend!"
5,Oh My Freaking God! Can you Believe this Book! I did not even have to Shave my Head!,"This book is AWESOME. I loved how it is so down to earth and speaks to each person who reads it in there own way.While I do not agree 100% with all that Robert says, overall the message behind the book totally rocks!It is a breath of fresh air to those with Wide Open Eyes.If you only Read One book this year, make sure it is this one!"
4,Rich Content,"Gives good food for thought concerning personal finance, careers and wealth. Good for adults to consider how they think about and handle money and also parents for how they teach their children about money. Not a step-by-step, DIY book, but a thought-inducer."
4,This Book Is Really Quite Valuable,"It is about money-producing assets and about money-wasting assets. It is about knowing the difference and developing the discipline to spend your hard earned dollars on assets that grow and not spending them on assets that waste. If you have discipline and some basic knowledge of money you can have money work for you. There is no point of working for a significent amount of money unless you learn to have money work for you. If not, you will be a slave to money which is typical of many workaholics."
3,Too much repetition,"I think some of the points he made are quite interesting. However, it could have been said in less than 50 pages.If you are looking for an easy read and some general knowledge of how SOME rich people leave, than you should buy this book. Remember that the author doesn't go into details. He wants you to buy his other books as well as tapes. What a salesman, indeed - as he claims to be."
1,If I hated someone and wanted to make them poor I'd give them this.,"Robert Kiyosaki has made a fortune from his books. After reading this I doubt he has made much money from any of his investments. The stories are suspiciously vague and even the title is misleading. Anybody thinking that the authors have done any research with lots of wealthy people to find out how they teach their kids about money will be disappointed. Most of the financial advice give here is general, off the cuff and toxic; basically real estate and stock speculation. The authors also encourage financing this through debt. The only other bit of advice is to incorporate to avoid taxes. Anybody who follows this advice is just gambling."
4,Good but not a instruction book,"This book is pretty good because the basics it mentions are fairly good.Its true that 90% of America does not know the different between a true asset and a liability. Financial money management is missing from most of education. If you listen to Dave Ramsey, he says many of the same things.As for the tax advice and deferrments in this book, I wouldn't bet the farm on it. Yes, things like 1031 do exist but some of the advice like buying a corporate car with a personal corporation is illegal(although the accounting advisor at H&R; block did inform me last year before I read the book that deducting mileage and gas on my car was a legal option). You can defer taxes forever on a few things, but not many of them and overall, taxes in America are progressive, not regressive as the author claims.I did learn and was reminded of many important principles by this book and book series, but I'd take a much closer look at tax law before deducting anything."
4,Talk about life changing?!?!?!,"Well, I was a little suprised that more effort was not put into making the book flow more eloquently. Other than that I absolutely loved every morsel of information. This book has really prepared me to take the proper steps to avoid another genreation of poverty in my family. I know now what it takes and am prepared to do it, all thanks to Kiyosaki and Letcher"
5,Yeah--what did happen to the five star reviews???,"(...)Regarding Rich Dad Poor Dad....a new and different philosphy that actually works. (...)buy this book. More importantly, apply the concepts(...)Why read and follow Kiyosaki? There is a philosophy that I believe in; if you keep on doing what you have always done you will keep on getting what you have always got. The traditional ways of doing things does not work. (...) for those of us who are more ethical and believe in the American Free Enterprise system, Kiyoaski offers another, better, more ethical way...and it really works.Ask the 13 year old who bought a 3/2 rental or the 65 year who with no retirement left, created a retirement income in record time.Also recommend Rich Dad's Success Stories(...)Thank you Mr. Kiyosaki!Thank you Rich Dad!(...)"
3,"I mean, it's alright","This is an easy read (completed it in two days)Most of the book is just emphasizing to take huge risks in order to be rich. I understand the principle, but this book is by no means a good tool to get rich. However, it is a good tool to motivate you to do something about it!"
3,Not a bad start,"I think this book does a good job of getting someone started in thinking the right way about money and how it works. He does a good job using examples to demonstrate some great concepts in ""Financial Literacy"". I like how he focuses on the mindset of how you should view money."
2,"Okay, but not the answer.","This was not a very good self-help type of program. Usable advice, enthusiasm, and some worthy points make it average, but it hardly reflects the title. Sorry guys, I'd pass on this one. Read Cyber-Psychonetics instead."
3,Okay.,"This is an okay book. I had a hard time reading this one. Normally, I can read a book in a matter of hours, but it took me a week to get into this book. I kept putting it down, which is unusual for me. For those looking for good financial advice, I recommend buying, ""The Richest Man in Babylon"" It's a very short but very good life changing book. Buy this one if you like a challenge."
3,"Inspiration writing book, but not easy to follow.","I found the author is a very good seller. He wrote the book with pretty interesting tone...(He also mentioned why he choose the title ""Rich Dad, Poor Dad..."". He said it will get people's attention, which confirm that he's a good seller.). However, the content is quite far from realistic. Not many people can success like him. The story is too ""in dream"". But if you're bored about life, it's ok to read this book. Overall, I rate this book 3 stars."
1,The book that they sent I could fit in the palm of hand!,The book was purchased for a friend who want to become so I they sent me a mininature version instead of the regular size it was a insult!
3,"Long-winded ""GEM"" of Wisdom","I can't give credit to the author for being a talented writer (albeit it was his first book), but the information - as basic as it was - is absolutely worth the time to plow through the storyline. I finished the book in 3 days because I couldn't put it down - and I am NOT a fast reader by any means. (granted, the line spacing helped)Anyway - If you're considering this book, take the time to follow the story - don't just accept a summary given by someone else."
5,"Great points without the hype of a ""secret strategy""","Most books written about building wealth are generally infomercials in print. This book, however, makes very good points without a lot of hype.Rich Dad Poor Dad shows a unique contrast between two key figures in the author's life. The book isn't just a motivational book, like an infomercial, and also doesn't just have some fail-safe plan to follow to riches.The author made the book concise, had excellent points that really made me think about my view on wealth-building, and still inspired me enough to try to change my financial course. I highly recommend this book to anyone sincerely seeking financial security and freedom."
2,Do you fit in this category?,"- Unhappy with your current financial situation- Sick of working for ""the man""- Extremely low financial IQIf so, congratulations. You are Robert Kiyosaki's target audience for this extremely simple book. I give it two stars only because it seems to make people start to think about what they are using their money for. But, did you really need a book to do that? More importantly, after you have read this do you feel like you have a good game plan for investing in appreciating assets?Take a minute to think about it. Did you learn anything, or were you simply pumped up to quit your day job (don't do it) by a total stranger who details nothing of HOW to become independently wealthy?You also may be interested to learn that much like James Frey's book, a lot of this (possibly even the ""Rich Dad"" character) was made up. http://www.johntreed.com/Kiyosaki.html"
4,Very Good!!,There are some good things in this book. People will have to rethink whether thier house is a Asset and the way they approach thier life and job.Except for this book please donot buy any of his other books because it is just a repeat of this one.
4,It's more 3.5 than 4,I don't know why amazon doesn't let you give 1/2 stars. In the same vane of many books with the aim to change your mindset to an investing type millionaire philosophy. I think it's important to read these books as motivation to keep trying. Nothing ground breaking or earth shattering but good advice.
3,"Rich Dad, Poor Dad","Robert T. Kiyosaki's Rich Dad, Poor Dad presents the differences between the ways the rich and the poor and middle class think. Growing up with two dads, his own educated dad, and his friends rich dad, he is able to compare the two groups mindsets and presents his reader with ways to approach money. He emphasizes the fact that today's normal education is not enough because it does not teach people enough about money, rather is teaches people how to get safe secure jobs. One of the main problems he suggests is the different classes understanding of assets and liabilities. He also explains that people need to take risks by investing in things such as stocks, mutual funds, and real estate in order to make money. The book presents ways that one should approach money and change their actions and thinking in order to be more successful in attaining money. The book is interesting but how much of it is realistic is probable debatable."
1,Dangerous book based on a lie,"Kiyosaki made up the character ""Rich Dad"", he never existed period.Kiyosaki is a failed businessowner who excels is lying and exploiting peoples dreams of becoming rich.This book WON'T make you rich, it contains no guides on how to become rich, just general advice that's been around for decades.His advice to speculate on real estate may very well been the cause of the financial crisis US is currently in, Kiyosaki effectively fueled the housing bubble the taxpayers are now paying for in trillions of dollars.This book is so irresponsible, wrong and full of lies that it sickens me. If you want someone to blame for all those foreclosures and subprime disasters, Kiyosaki is your best bet."
4,Get Rich or Get Smart,"Along with my colleagues, this book is not for the ""Get Rich"" crowd. This book is for people who want to be smart about money. Instead of working for Uncle Sam, learn how to name Abraham Linclon, George Washington, Benjamin Franklin and other monetary celebrities as employees of your corporation. Take a seat and learn Financial Ed 101."
3,OK Read,"Perhaps a little long winded in narrative, but good in telling how to rethink money, professions and raising kids."
2,"Materialsm, pure and simple","This is one sick capitalist puppy. Mr. Kiyosaki has so fully embraced the religion of money, he has forgotten some of the truly important things in life. I know its all been said before, but money really isn't everything. Certainly it's important - everything is easier when you don't have to worry about providing for your family, but when everything else, even spending money, is seen as secondary to accumulating it, I think a question of priorities should be posed."
1,This book is a joke right?,"Poor writing with no practical advise at all. A few common sense ideas that you already know. Don't waste your money, this book is a liability not an asset!"
3,A Valid but Wordy Message,"As a high school student I found this book to be very insightful. I learned that a college education is not enough to enough to make one rich since school educates students to be good employees rather than successful moneymakers. This realization has caused me to really think about my future. I will continue to work hard in the classroom, but I will also make an effort to financially educate myself.Although the book taught me this valuable lesson, I was disappointed in the way it was written. Kiyosaki is extremely redundant making the book a lot longer than it needed to be."
4,motivational,"I recently purchased this book for my husband as well as several other books in the series. My husband is in the military and also takes a big interest in real estate. Since giving him the books several of the other guys in his platoon have borrowed the books and have found new passion and insite not only in real estate but their personal goals in life. Although most books in the series expand on the writers experiences in real estate, the principals can be applied to many different occupations, personal and professional goals. I highly reccomend this book to anyone feeling the ""hamster in the wheel"" syndrome, (running real fast but getting no where) and anyone re-evaluating or concidering a career move. If anything, it may motivate you to make a change. Maybe not into real estate but a change to better your situation."
2,Skeptical,"I had heard great things about this book, and I was very disappointed when I read it. I have serious doubts about the credibility of Robert Kiyosaki. I don't think he made money in real estate, he made money by selling get rich books.Half of the book is empty advice filled with cliche stories. I think he made most of it up. The rest of the text is a sales pitch for his board game and seminars.There is no secret to getting rich. It just takes discipline."
3,"Great start, if you like real estate","First half of this book is a great read. Then the rest goes on and on about real estate. He even says don't do real estate unless you love it and then rambles on about all the real estate he has bought or helped friends bought. I have no interest in real estate and if I had I would most likely be bankrupt at this point considering the housing market in Michigan. This was all probably sound advice in the 90's, but with the housing and credit markets the way they are now, only a few with enough cash put away could benefit from his real estate tips. I say either borrow a copy of Rich Dad Poor Dad or buy it used. I won't be bothering with the many other spinoffs from this book either as I'm sure they're just filled with the same stuff. And seriously, almost $200 for the Cashflow game?"
4,An easy read!,"I enjoyed reading Robert Kiyosaki's life experiences. I've learned from this that ultimately, you have to expand on who you want to learn from if you desire to get to that next level. You can always learn more from a different culture, family, value system, standard, and so on - just remember to maintain your course and never stop learning!"
2,"Generalities, but no specific info","Dissappointed in this book.......it was highly recommended, but I didn't even finish it."
5,Rich Dad Poor Dad,"This book has revolutionized our life and the lives of our kids and business associates, we highly recommend it."
1,morally repugnant,"this book makes me want to vomit. from the beginning of the book, you get to hear the story of this guy's dad, and how wise he was to not pay someone any more money than they asked for, because they deserved to be poor. that's right, guys! according to this book, the poor deserve to be poor! i suggest the author take a trip to some place like africa, and visit any of the MILLIONS of poor people on this planet (after all, us well-off americans are the vast minority) and tell them to their face that it's their fault. hey, maybe it's God's plan! after all, this is a CHRISTIAN book, right? gee, i thought God was supposed to be against greed, and for treating people right. guess i was wrong. a great primer on how to treat people like dogs and have a heart of pure stone. Godly? HA!"
1,No advise is better than False advise,"If you want to read about lies, bogus claims andwrong advise...then buy the book.Stay away from this crook..."
1,WANT TO MAKE MONEY? RESELL THIS BOOK!,"After having resisted this book and finally reading it, I know why I put it off for so long: this guy is a fraud! He offers no practical advice on money management and his ""Secrets"" have underlying moral decay to them. If you really want to make money, buy this book used and then sell it for more than you paid for! At least someone like Suze Orman gives you advice based on reality...this guy seems to live in a fantasy land!"
1,Bought as a gift for my son.,I bought this as a gift for my son. He read it and thought that it was a complete joke.
1,VERY mini,did not realize this was a miniature addition since it was the same price as the regular addition. Lesson learned - pay attention to detail.
3,Only mildly interesting,"Although I love her ""WOLF"" series, with some minor reservations, I subsequently have been reading her other efforts and these look to be more like a beginers attempts at serious writing."
4,DualJack Comes Through,"When a client called to run a phone line from her basement to her home office through a stone wall, I blanched. The work required to run the line exceeded my initial cost estimates by several times. Searching online for an alternative, I came across DualJack and was impressed by the overwhelmingly positive response it garnered from users.Once installed - and working properly (the dip switches had to be set precisely for the brand of phone being used) - the noise level on the line was no worse than you'd expect from a long line length. Only the faintest hiss could be heard in the background, and was entirely undetectable during a phone call.I highly recommend the DualJack - it comes through with flying colors."
3,DTX WIRELESS PHONE JACK,"i bought this for use with my wireless laptop. i guess i will need the 4 wire jack for it to work correctly because it won't connect. There was a small shipping problem but Danny went the extra mile so i would give them an ""Excellent"" on service. Hopefully the different wire will solve my problem."
1,not happy at all,"I used this to connect my satellite dish to a phone line. At first it worked; for perhaps 2 or three months when I began to get a message that I didn't have phone connection to my satellite provider. I didn't worry too much or try to figure out what was wrong immediately. I did then try everything to find the problem (new phone cords, new locations) then wrote to the seller and to Amazon describing what I had done and asking for advice and what the return policy would be. That was about a month ago and I have never heard a thing from the seller although I did get a response from Amazon. Very unsatisfactory."
5,legands and headliners,"I have visted Shore Acres twice and both times never wanted to leave, why? The same reason Cassie Simpson nerver wanted to leave. The beauty the scenery possesed and the connection of feeling of one. This book sent me to tears at the end. I have a book I purchased on one of my adventures to shore Acres and I knew of the ending but this Author is one of the best i have EVER come across who's words touched me so deeply. looking forward to reading all of her books, now on my 3rd. book. and who better to tell of the great people who are legands and headliners that shapped the state i live in."
4,A practical approach to physical immortality,"I liked this book allot. It is straight forward, easy to read and quite enjoyable. I finished it in one day and began to immediately implement the ideas in my life. Be prepared to do some work however, this is no magic pill, but a daily action plan to be followed that gives hope from real life examples living now. Read it anyway, well worth it to expand your horizons."
5,very sturdy!,These are super sturdy and great for outdoor playing in the dirt. I love that they are made of wood and metal. I think they are going to last us a long time.
5,Very Nice,This was a birthday present for my two year old grandson. He loves to dig in the dirt and this will be perfect come summer.
5,Our 4 year grandson LOVES them,They are just like his mom's. Well made and quite durable. He works along side his mom in the gardens using these tools
4,Excellent quality for the price; functional but also lightweight and small handles,This is a great set of tools for your young gardener to be. The packaging says 5 plus. But with supervision this could be used by much younger children. As many of the reviews point out these are metal not plastic. Which makes them more functional. But the designers still made them very lightweight with small enough handles that most 18 months old and certainly 2 year olds could use them as well.But the trade off is that you have to use these in good soil. An already tilled flower bed or a vegetable garden. They are just too lightweight for medium or more gardening jobs. I was very pleased with the price on Amazon and you get your money's worth with these. Recommended.
4,Not the dog it was supposed to be,"NO, they didn't use a Skye Terrier as the story is about, but the Westy star is a winner, bordering on ""too cute"" at times. For a film company to want to redo this story to be more accurate, as they touted, this story isn't as strong or any closer to the real story than Disney's version. Still, it's beautifully filmed, heart-warming, and enjoyable."
5,Delightful True Story about a Dog who Changes a City!,"This movie is most charming. At first the Scottish accents are so strong that it is difficult to understand. However, just turn the volume up and then things start to fall into place. It is the true story of how a dog's loyalty to his deceased master becomes a rallying cry for the poorer inhabitants of Edinburgh to contradict the local mill boss. It is very moving and conveys a message of hope against all odds. This movie makes for a wonderful family evening. A very recommendable and clean film."
4,Adventures of Greyfriars Bobbyh,"A lovely story, based on a true story of a little dog in Scotland. It was interesting and a little different from the other telling of this story, Greyfriars Bobby."
5,Moliere's got the right stuff,"Richard Wilbur has created a wonderful translation of these two comedies, but even if you're not big on poetry (because it is Wilbur's capturing of the poetry that make these masterful translations), you can still enjoy Moliere's characters: the misanthrope Alceste, who derides others' weaknesses while having some of them himself, and Tartuffe, a type of hypocritical scoundrel that still roams the earth and causes everyone else problems. These plays are all about relationships with characters who are always with us, no matter the time and place.I would love to see these plays made into modern movies. With a little adjustment to the script, these characters fit into any time and place, including the 21st century when royalty is mostly an amusement park ride for the rest of us."
2,some good tips,"Just finished scanning this book. As a home schooler, it seems to have a very good list of phonics facts. I did find however the continuous references to war and violence when the author was illustrating a point-a bit - no, very tiresome. Perhaps the gulf war was of special interest to the author or perhaps it was a conscious effort to make the book appear timely. In my humble opinion it was just plain annoying.As a Canadian, I found bits and pieces of useful information. I will NOT use this book as my only resource - but will keep it for reference."
5,"Damn, I Still Can't Play Like Him.","I'd like to say this DVD made all the difference in my playing, but I'd have to be John Entwistle to figure it all out. The DVD is great because it is an archive of the creative process of a lost musical genius. Getting past the few practicable tricks, there's some of John's musical philosophies saved for future generations. I know it sounds silly, but imagine having Hendrix sit down and dissect his playing, or Mozart discuss his thoughts on composition with someone who asks the questions you would.Its also amazing how video production has changes over the past 20 years. The picture is good, but you can see the improvements in cameras and tapes."
1,Stateside Long Distance Genealogy,The title of this book is very misleading as I expected more coverage than just U.S.A. long distance.A description of this product needs clarification to prevent a useless book from just occupying space on your bookshelf.
5,Song of Norway,I have loved this recording for 65 years. I was estatic to find the one I loved on CD. I listen to it every night.
5,How Not to Look Fat,Great little book. A lot of information given in a very entertaining way. Very helpful and fun at the same time!
5,The Evolution of Chess,"Who better to write about the History of Chess than a chess master and well established historian? In Eales' 'Chess - The History of a Game', we are taken through the various influences that cultures and social circles have had on chess through the years. Not only will this book interest the regular chess enthusiast - it will also provide a fascinating read for anyone interested in the evolution of a game - a game that ' has been variously described as a sport, a science or an art' and has captivated peoples for over a thousand years."
5,How to see the full uncut intestines scene on this DVD,"First of all this is a good movie by Wes Craven. This washis first movie. Anyway all you need to do is go on to the documentary ""Forbidden Footage"" while Wes is talking it goes intothat seen and you see a lot more than you do on the movie. So this DVD is basically uncut but to get a pinch more go on to ""Forbidden Footage"". Most people should know this but if you don't than know you know. Just so you know the VHS IS cut and the DVD is pretty much uncut..."
4,This is what Wes Craven was about.,"Wes Craven is one of the biggest genre defining directors of our time. It pains me to see him responsible for such [...] as the scream trilogy and shall we mention ""Cursed"".This is one of those movies that i had to take a shower after watching, it leaves you with that weird cramp in the pit of your stomach.Its not so much scary(scary to think that this kind of thing actaully happens) as it is disturbing, gritty, and realistic.If you call yourself a horror fan and have not seen this movie, pick it up, its well worth the 12 bucks that amazon has it listed for currently."
2,Overrated,"I had heard so much about this film. ""Its so violent, its so disturbing, blah, blah, blah."" I finally went out and rented it. What a disappointment! The story is good enough: Two girls go the city to see a concert, try buying some pot, and end up being kidnapped by some escaped cons. The girls are eventually killed and the killers end up hiding, unknowingly, at one of the girl's parents' home, where the parents take their revenge. But the camera work is awful, the music is stupid, and the acting is average at best. The two bumbling cops are completely unnecessary and unfunny. I constantly see this film mentioned in the same company as ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"", which is an insult to TCM. Fred Lincoln, who plays one of the convicts, once said this is the only movie he made that he wished he hadn't, and he went on to make ""adult"" films! Wes Craven went on to make some good films, but this one is lame."
1,1.5 stars,"Last house on the left sucked. Story was about 2 girls who get kidnapped and then try to get away from these psycho druggys and end up dead, then the family of the girls seek revenge. I saw this film once, i could not beleive wes craven did this. This film is horrible, and not cause its low budget either, texas chainsaw massacre was low budget and was an excellent film. I dont know how anyone can find this movie scary, the end of the film isnt shocking at all its just some father coming after them with a chainsaw and then it ends. The characters in texas chainsaw massacre were scary and disturbing and in some parts funny but these characters had no charm or scaryness about them and they certainly are not memorable, just a group of drugged up whackos. I cant see how this is groundbreaking , maybe for the genre it was but this film is very bad. Not recomended at all."
3,Good movie,"Yes,it's dated and I actually haven't seen it in a while.But let me just say this is a sickening movie. Yes, Iunderstand that it probably isn't these days becausethese sickening things you see and hear about everyday.We live in a culture were things like this simply don'tseem like a big deal anymore. People just shut off the TV'sand forget about it.I first seen this film as a youngster in the middle 80's andit was rather gruesome. The rape and the revenge are equallyrepugnant, and it's almost like Wes Craven is seeing into thefuture of what america would be like, and it's basically whatit has become now so people aren't so effected. America reallydoesn't have any innocence left, so I guess it isn't surprising.I don't think this movie is worth buying, but if you see it forrent then it will be worth checking out."
3,Don't Believe the Hype,"The Last House on the Left fell horribly short. Lines are awkward, acting terrible, and the plot was that of a third grader. . This movie is not scarey, not explicit or even half GOOD! I would have given it less stars but factoring in that it was Wes Cravens first movie and filmed in the early seventies it was probably scarey and horrible to audiences."
1,Not worth a dollar.,"I really thought this movie was going to be great. I watched it, and I was very dissapointed. The main menu of the DVD is better than the whole movie. I thought the story line was horrible, the acting was worse. The score was absolutely terrible. There were scenes in the movie where the girl was running from the killer, and it was some upbeat banjo song. How bad is that. I want to give this movie a zero star rating as well. I really wish I could take it back and get my money back, but I can't. I wouldnt even pick it up at a garage sale for a quarter. This movie is horrible. Dont waste your time, or money."
2,"Lame...Boring, Too much ... Circus Benny Hill Music","I have already watched the new 2009 version and really liked it. This original version is boring, i actually fell asleep 4 times. I had to stop it and come back to watch the rest the next day. This is supposed to be a horror/thriller movie, but then the benny hill type circus soundtrack is horrible. Some of the scenes are even humorous, like the police officers trying to hitchhike after they ran out of gas. The new modern version is much better. Oh ... and what's with their daughter refusing to wear a bra and showing her breasts in front of her father ... ? That was creepy."
3,Wes Craven's Directoral Debut,"Though this movie is for the most part, a very low-budget, amateurish, & slightly comedic, LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT is also a very disturbing, twisted, & nightmarish horror film. Wes Craven's first effort, along with Tobe Hooper's TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE & George Romero's NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD, ushered in a new breed of horror film. Films that leaves the audience sick to their stomachs & makes them feel very dirty after watching them. When PSYCHO made audiences stay away from the showers, LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT made them RUN TO the showers. This movie featured very graphic details of horror & violence. Though not as polished as his later films, LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT introduced Wes Craven to the unsuspecting world as a very imaginative & talented filmmaker."
2,My Friend & I saw this in the 70's.......,"...and I can remember some of the scenes to this day (i'm 49 now). I was 16;my friend,17 at the time. I used to hitchhike to and from her house a lot in those days,and after that movie, I didn't-for a long time. At the time it was a really scary film,and the urban legend at the time was that it was based on a true story,which only added to the starkness of it. Of course,as some have opined here, what is perceived as horrifying then and what's considered horrifying now is like comparing oranges and rutabagas.""Horror-and-brutality technology"" in films has definitely-and I use this word wryly-evolved."
1,Im so glad this movie is so old so people can forget it,"Lurid junk. The scenes in this film are disturbing yet the horrible acting is even more so disturbing.If you are to view this movie take into mind that its very primitive and savage. I don't think but about 000000000.1% of people alive today remember this. Heck, even Wes Craven forgot he made this pile or atleast he wants to forget."
1,A Wonderful Example of Man's Inhumanity to Women,"In watching this low-budget horror flick, one can't help but wonder how many violent acts against women it and other similar movies have spawned."
3,disturbing or one of a kind?,"this movie is a disturbing movie right from the beginning, even if it a very disturbing movie its concept is very one of a kind. if u have a weak stomach i suggest you dont watch this movie. it starts of with two girls that are going to a concert but run into an escape confict and wish to buy drugs. this leads to their kidnap, rape, and murder. the murderers end up staying at one of the girls house and her parents realize that they had killed their daughter. they take matters into their own hands which is unbelivable they way they handle it."
1,The Lame House on the Left,"I know a lot of people who love this movie and swear its the best thing since Suspiria. NOT TRUE!! At least in my humble opinion. I watched it when it came on demand (cable people know) and I am so glad I did not waste my money on this ridiculous movie.Two idiot girls are chased and raped and everything else by these dumb convicts. Unless I am wrong, and believe me, I tried to give it a fair chance and watched it twice, I just don't see what all the fuss is about. Proven by the fact that every used dvd store in my area has a hundred copies. Don't waste your money unless you like low budget torture movies with a ridiculous plot."
1,WHAT A WASTE!!! LAST TURKEY ON THE LEFT,"Let's hope this is truly the last house on the left, and that there aren't any others! I cannot even sit still long enough to get through this tripe. Bad acting, horrible music, and that's just in the first half hour! The extras are downright disgusting, like we really need to see someone have their bowels fondled by some crazy sexually confused psycho-chick. UGH! Thought that scene would never end. PLEASE spend your hard earned cash on something a little more worthy than this trash. Any of the NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET flix come to mind...If I could, I wouldn't even give this one star..."
2,Ummmm,"I read reviews b4 i watched this and i tried to keep in mind how old this movie is. I thought the music definately ruined it. It made it more corny than anything. I don't really have too much to say on this one. If u want to watch it, watch the remake. It was definately better in my notion."
4,Last House on the Left(1972),"Last House on the Left(1972) is a bone crunching 1970's exploitation film directed by Wes Craven. The film's tone is all over the place. It goes from silly to shocking to sad to violent! A mild mannered couple hunt a gang leader after he rapes and kills their daughter! Wes Craven was trying to shock people living in the Nixon era. Last House on the Left was put on the UK's ""Video Nasties"". This film was remade in 2008 or so with Sara Paxton. Last House on the Left is similar to Sam Peckinpah's violent drama Straw Dogs(1971). A young Martin Kove plays a police officer in the film. Last House on the Left is classic exploitation."
4,still powerful horror,"Watching THE LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT is like watching a snuff movie: It was cheaply produced and has a grainy quality, which only adds to the feel. The actors are horrifyingly realistic whether playing the victims or the sadists. This isn't horror in the sense of ""OOH... that was scary."" It does, however, define the word ""Horror."" You often can't believe what you're seeing, and often don't want to see anymore. It's an attack on your senses: moral, emotional, sexual... It's a great psychological piece and whether you love it or hate it, you can't deny its impact on the viewer, nor its importance in the history of horror cinema as one of the most violent films ever made. Without it, there probably wouldn't be a TEXAS CHAINSAW or FRIDAY THE 13th. While definitely not for everyone, I would still definitely recommend checking it out."
1,The last Dvd on the shelf,"This movie came unrated, but if i was going to put a rating on it today it would be R13 Max. The movie left everthing to the imagination and failed to deliver on any real Horror/Violence level."
4,"""THE SEX CRIME OF THE CENTURY""","Wes Craven's first film ""LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT"" is one of the very first reality horror films! It is also one of the very best reality horror movies! Before ""MANIAC"" ""HENRY:portrait of a serial killer"" ""AMERICAN PSYCHO"" & ""SCRAP BOOK"" there was ""LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT"""
1,Gutter Trash,"As close to snuff as any film in the seventies managed, technically inept, a pornographic rip-off of Bergman's ""Virgin Spring,"" and overall, just hideous. Yes, the brutality left an impression. Is that what you are looking for?"
2,Lame,"Two problems.First problem. Let's say you're the typical kidnapper-rapist-killer. For fun and out of postmodern boredom, you kidnap two girls off the street in New York City. What are the odds that your randomly-chosen getaway and killing spot is going to be exactly where one of the girls lives, 60 or 70 miles away? One in ten million? Twenty million?Second problem. The movie, even with a run time of an otherwise-short 84 minutes, doesn't have enough action or development to fill the void. In short, it's boring, and in several scenes where Craven seems more interested in the bucolic Wechester County scenery than moving the plot along, I found myself reaching for the fast-forward."
3,game guid,"its a good material for new players but unfortunately for myself I didn't find much about what I wanted for the ""very hard"" mode."
2,young literary tigers overreach their hoop and hit flames,"this was obviously written by two smart alecky publishing types--it reeks of the stale air and desperate humor found in the slushpile trenches. (how can something be both pile and trench? when it's slushy, i guess.) but it's pretty funny. in a puerile way. if you're the kind of person who likes to get stoned and play star wars trivial pursuit, i guess. it tries a little too hard, though. especially in the wyndham lewis sections. and i could have done without the homage to jerry lewis, not to mention the alexander pope/elton john/kissinger conspiracy theory. the movie reviews are great! but I don't think either author ever had a dog."
4,Old Children's Songs,"With a new grandbaby in the family, I enjoyed brushing up on some old children's songs. Some of these I had forgotten. This CD will help me teach the songs to our little one as she grows. Nice selection on this CD."
3,Good for a Refresher but not an Introduction.,"I purchased this book after I had already taken a class in Differential Equations and several upper level undergraduate physics courses. While I found the easy access to quick explanations and examples useful, I feel that the range of topics was slightly limited and that there did need to be more examples. If I had been studying this subject for the first time, I would not have found this book nearly as useful as the majority of the Schaum's Outlines have proved to be."
3,Not for beginners,"Although I'm taking a medium-level differential equations class now, we have still not covered much of the material in this book. The cover falsely advertizes this book as something that can be used with an intro calculus class or AP calculus class. This book is the last book you will want to buy to help you for one of those classes. If you're taking an intermediate to upper level differential equations class, think about buying this book. Otherwise forget it."
5,High Hopes,"Had high hopes that this would work as I do not tolerate pesticides at all and mites were a problem. It does seem to work well, and I seem to tolerate it OK (not smelly). It's not immediate, but does work."
1,Did nothing for me,I like to leave the best reviews I can on Amazon and this is probably only my second 1 star review. This stuff did nothing for me at all. Nothing. Used it twice and then trashed it. Smells like vinegar
5,Kills bird mites and a whole lot more,"This stuff is AWESOME. One of my cats killed and brought in a bird that was infested with mites. I used this stuff to dip my cats who all managed to get the mites, spray their beds (and ours), scratching posts and I used it to clean all the wire racks in the linen closet. It works great! And most importantly, it is non-toxic, so my cats despite being dipped in it are fine and mite free as is the rest of my house."
2,Doesn't clean,"I tried this for general cleaning and found it doesn't really do much of anything. I was trying to get rid of fleas my indoor cats had somehow gotten, but this didn't even clean any surface dirt. Waste of money."
4,Smells Funny But It Works,"We have serious dust allergies, so we decided to buy some of this stuff as a Fabreze replacement, since it can also be used for cleaning as well as clothing. Basically, we've been mixing it 4 to 1 with water and put it in a spray bottle for easy use. We spray it on clothes that are clean, but perhaps a little dusty because they haven't been worn for a couple weeks between washings. The spray works well, but does dry slowly and smells a but funny. But it does work and helps cut down on dust mites. You can even spray a little on your skin if you're getting itchy bites, and it does help a lot. We even add it to our mop bucket to help sanitize the hardwood floors. It's a bit pricey, and doesn't have any frills like a pleasing scent, but it does work. Not sure if I'd buy again or not, but it's a decent enough product and I like having some on hand."
1,"VEGETARIAN??? Um, NO.","Nice. They have ""vegetarian"" right in the title of the product, and it has BEEF in it! WTF?!?!?!"
2,Danzig's Worst Album,"Danzig is a Big 3 on the Glenn Danzig Band Scale (1 Misfits, 2 Samhain, 3 Danzig), but this album is bad, really bad. The best song on it in my opinion is either 04 Going Down To Die, or 11 Stalker Song, and even at that, they are both 3/5. Also, if your playing it in a continuous loop, the extra tracks come in as a big hassle. It is cool when you put the album in your stereo, and it displays, 6664:43 or something like that because there is 66 tracks and the cd is an hour and some odd minutes long, BUT THAT IS IT!!! All and All the cd blows, and I'd recommend Danzig 3: How the Gods Kill as the best Danzig Album to buy"
2,Confusing,"First of all, i'm not really a fan of world music, so my review is biased.I bought the album solely because I wanted a track by Peter Gabriel that was supposed to be on the album.I listened to the CD all the way through (twice!) and didn't find it although he is mentioned on the CD information.I found the CD to be repetitive and not too inspired.Also, I was frustrated by the lack of information on the CD cover; no track names, times, artists, etc.I guess that this type of info may not be important to a concept CD, but for someone trying to find a specific track it was a pain!"
3,CAVEAT EMPTOR,"In 1997, the complete ""The Concerts in China"" was exquisitely remastered by Sony and released, at least in Europe, on a single disc. As far as I know, this remastering is only available in that form, and does not apply to this product (Dreyfus; ASIN: B000001ZS7). I strongly recommend seeking out the Sony remaster, because the sound quality difference is not subtle."
1,my order,I bought a dvd and it doesnt work in any of the dvd players. i would like to maybe get it on vhs.
3,Small rooms only,"I agree with other reviewers who have said this fan runs quietly and is well constructed. I also agree that this is best for a bedroom or small office. Not powerful enough for a livingroom, playroom, hot kitchen, etc. I ended up returning it to buy a larger, more powerful model, but otherwise this is a good product."
4,Duracraft DY-012 Oscillating 3-Speed Tower Fan,"Speedy delivery, well packaged. Couldn't ask for anything more.Duracraft DY-012 Oscillating 3-Speed Tower Fan"
3,Low-Octane Fan,"The highest setting is basically a mild breeze. It's not very strong at all, but at the very least it's quiet, it's small enough to squeeze into a corner, and to a certain extent, gets the job of airflow done (I'm therefore keeping it, I'm also too lazy to return it...). I wouldn't suggest it for a room that needs a lot of air current though. This is a relatively weak fan."
1,"Loud, Rattling Noise Right Out of Box, 2 Attempts","I bought this product for my girlfriend who needs ""white noise"" to sleep. Her previous fan of 5 years gave out so I decided to get this one. It was cheap enough....you get what you pay for! She was looking for ""white noise"", this was more like a jet engine with a loose screw. The unit shakes and rattles HORRIBLY. I submitted for a return and got a 2nd one within a week. Same problem. This fan is not worth a dime! I will probably try to return it for a full refund this time instead of an exchange. I have bought many items from Amazon and this is the first time I'm ever writing a review urging people to stay away! STAY AWAY, this unit is awful and I gave them 2 attempts. It is just poorly designed and cheaply put together."
4,Powerful air flow and slim design,"I'm a city dweller who lives on the third floor of an apartment building (with an attic) that was built in the 1930s and was last modernized in the early 1970s. I simply suffer in summer.I bought this fan one night during a fan-buying binge (the 100 degree day high made me do it).For the price, this is a great little fan. I set mine up in the hallway to help air traffic. It has three speed settings and oscillates.The downside is that there is some assembly required. You have to secure the fan to a mount with three screws (included) and secure the extension cord. It's not too difficult to do, but it does require some awkward balancing of parts and a Philips screwdriver."
3,pretty good for the price,"My thought behind buying this is two fold. First I wanted a fan to circulate air so I can use my air conditioner less. And second, on those sweltering days I put it in front of the air conditioner and it helps circulate the cool air from the air conditioner. It's a tad shorter that the one my husband bought for the living room, but it's also a third the price so..."
2,Just alright. Short lived.,"I bought this fan about a year ago and would just use it a couple of hours each night in my living room while I watched TV before bedtime. During the summer only. It quit working last night. I was never impressed with the air output to begin with, even on the highest setting. I think I was actually relieved it broke down. It gave me an excuse run out to Bed Bath and Beyond. I picked up a simple Lasko table fan for $17. The air output on this one totally blows away (no pun intended) that of the more expensive Duracraft Tower Fan."
5,An excellent blend of business savvy and specifics tuned,"Any interested in studio photography as a business will find Edward Lilley's Business Of Studio Photography to be an important guide to building a studio photography venture from the ground up. From choosing a location and equipping it to pricing work and catering to the wedding, portrait or commercial markets, Business Of Studio Photography provides an excellent blend of business savvy and specifics tuned to the studio photography world."
3,Outdated,This book was revised in 2002. There is still plenty of good advise and a great place to start. But every time you come across something that you know is out dated you start wondering what else you might be missing or worse wasting time on. Having said that there is plenty of good sound business practice advise that will always be relevant.
3,Very well written,"Tempered Hearts was written in a strong voice that spoke volumes to 'Christian' fiction. It was realistic and romantic, but without overwhelming us with too much 'morality checking'. The story was allowed to shine through the message. I have to hand it to Pam, the book was a good read, one I encouraged my daughters to enjoy."
2,Thought was good stuff,"Moves a whole lot of water and should not be considered for small tanks under 55gal. as splashing may result. A good power head for larger under-gravel filters or foam block bacteriological filtering. Parts are readily available, impeller etc.. One caveat, it appears it is too easy to break off the tabs that secure the impeller assembly rendering the entire device trash.Update after 9 months of use............The tabs securing the impeller assembly to the head have begun to spread causing the jet direction to change while in use, very frustrating. One one occasion the unit came apart in the tank. I am already looking to find a more durable replacement after just 9 months of use."
4,Don't wash this book,"....Keith Knight's book is a madcap look into his world of public transportation, psycho roommates, dating, and cartooning, as well as being an insightful, intelligent look at racism, social politics, and other issues. I especially love the ones about riding the bus and about when Keith and a friend went to a gay bar. My jaw still hurts from laughing. ...."
3,Pretty book,Not exactly what I thought it would be. This is completely my fault as I undoubtedly didn't read the synopsis closely enough.
5,WOW,"WOW! That's all I can say. This is a traditional drama, slow in the building and then it just pops. An amazingly emotional movie, heart-felt, gut-wrenching, stunning, I can't say enough. Yes, it is slow in the beginning, for a purpose though. It's a slow simmer/burn that leads to an ending you can't forget.Truly amazing. The acting, script, story, everything...finally!! A good drama out of Hollywood, the land of bubbles and bs...they finally have a winner!"
4,Loving Pattinson,"The movie ""Remember Me"" was absolutely great. Touched you with emotions of love, anger, doubt and loss, just to name a view.Pattinson was foudroyant in his performance, bringing all the emotions to the screen. The whole cast was wonderful and the story has you so engrossed in what is happening in their lives. Not knowing what the title of the movie actually means until the very end was heart wrenching."
2,A forgettable movie,When I went to review this movie I couldn't even remember what it was about. I remember the actors but not the story line. I guess the movie is begging to be remembered because it wasn't very good.
3,Remember Me,This was not only a bit unusual but I was not prepared for the ending and I honestly believe that if I had known it was set around 9/11 I would not have watched it. Robert Pattinson did a wonderful job of portraying his character but it was somewhat dark with all the family discord and his own demons that he was dealing with. I have to say that I sat with clenched teeth at the ending of the movie. I was a very unhappy person and even though I own this DVD I doubt that I will ever watch it again and I would not recommend it to others. Of course this is just one person's opinion. Others may thoroughly enjoy it.
5,What great real life interaction of young people.,Portrays real life problems of young people growing up. Shows there is always hope in real life situations. Even when hope seems impossible.
2,Everything's forgettable but the ending,"Watching Remember Me is a strange and frustrating experience.For most of the time, it's a generic romantic movie about a brooding and troubled guy (Robert Pattinson) falling in love with a cute blonde (Emile de Ravin) and how that love helps lift him out of his funk to become the man we always knew he could be. It's crap, but it's well crafted crap.[...]"
4,For Rob Fanatics Only,"It's just a pleasure to watch him, and Emelie's really good too. (Better acting than what's-her-name with the blinking thing and too-fast-delivery from Twilight). The ending is just a full thud dud though. I mean, all that sexual tension and emotional build up and he's nixed?? I liked everything up to that point but it would have been better if dad Brosnan was killed just when he's coming around to being more of a real father, or Rob is one of the ones who escapes the tower and the father has an anguished wait with Emelie to find out if his other son is dead too....this was just gratuitous. Cop out on the writer/director's part. Wait for it to go on sale."
5,movie mom,"I went into this movie thinking i would like it, and knowing that the ""professional"" reviewers who gave it gastly reviews were merly being a little tough. But after watching it I knew they were not only dead wrong, they were just being mean for the sake of being mean.I found this to be a wonderful movie that not only delt with every emotion there is, but handled them with such grace that it could take your breath away.I also found the ending not olny supriseing (in who) but very well done and bitter sweet. I felt all of the actors did an amazing job, especially the males and the little sister (an unbelievabl little actor, also on Nurse Jackie).I would say see it, buy it! I have, and have already given it as a gift several times, and plan to keep doing so.Wonderful movie!"
4,Bought for someone else,I purchased this as a gift for someone and have never seen the film myself. She was quite pleased to receive it though. It was a great price and arrived quickly.
4,"""Great Little Movie""","Its not often I give four stars to a movie these days, but this is a clear exception. Whether you are male or female, it makes no difference on this one. Its what I call a ""sleeper"". I don't recall any big promotional pushes or any academy award nominations for this, but here it is.....one of the best films I have seen in recent years.What you have here is a great story, with great actors, and great directing. When you get this combination of ingredients, it becomes film magic. This one is at the Harry Houdini, or David Copperfield level.Multiple, believable characters, each with their own story line combine to produce a fascinating movie that holds your interest and keeps you guessing where it is going to wind up. The ending is an emotional ""high impact"", take your breath away, winner!"
2,What the?,"Rambling story, terrible plot line. It started out good, then lost its way and didn't seem to know what it was really about. Pattison's acting was better than expected, it could have been a better movie with a tighter story line."
3,It was just okay,"Seems to have taken to long to get into the story, and then when it did, it was over. It was just not that great."
1,Forget me...,"My favorite part about this movie was watching the ""Haunted Flower"" review it.HORRIBLE MOVIE!!!!!! BEWARE!!!!!!1. No plot2. No character development3. SELF PITY4. SELF PITY5. SELF PITY6. SELF PITY7. No virtue in any of the characters except the little girl8. SELF PITY9. I think the script of the movie was 5 pages long... NO DIALOGUE10. WinyThis is in my top 5 WORST FILMS EVER SEEN!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,Delzen,"Acting was a little staged and ending was predictable , very sad. How much sadness can one take in an escape movie?"
5,THIS GIVES NEW AGE A NEW IMAGE,This is one of the best recordings and it has been very hard to find. This is the Jean Michel Jarre Masterpiece that all fans must have!!!! Please take the opprotunity to buy this now because when they run out of reissues then that is the end and you will not be able to find this. I have been looking for over 10 years and finally found it here on Amazon.comThanks
5,"Solid, but listen to the disc 2 as well","Nicely summarizes Jarre's earlier works, as well as giving us some original tracks as well. It's a pity, though, that they didn't make this and Disc 2 into a single double-CD set. I also like nice little touches such as clips from the publie Chinese radio broadcast on Jarre's show. I would love to own a video of this historic event in pre-capitalist China."
3,CAVEAT EMPTOR,"In 1997, the complete ""The Concerts in China"" was exquisitely remastered by Sony and released, at least in Europe, on a single disc. As far as I know, this remastering is only available in that form, and does not apply to this product (Dreyfus; ASIN: B000001ZS6). I strongly recommend seeking out the Sony remaster, because the sound quality difference is not subtle."
5,Great for blemishes,"Anne F. Pagan, New York City-This is the second time I purchase this product, and its great for your facial and body skin. It makes your skin soft, smooth, and blemish free as a baby's skin. I use this product when I make my natural mask that consist of sweet almond oil, rose hip oil, and honey. I use it under as a light moisturizer around my eyes, face, the neck and any facial blemish at night. The almond oil lightens, a lot, the blemish area. You cannot even notice you had an acne or scar blemish. Its even great to place a small drop or two in your bath and great for massages."
3,Odorless,This oil is odorless. I bought it thinking it would smell like sweet almond but it doesn't. You could probably add your favorite fragrance essential oil to this to create your own blend.
4,Happy with these.,"My sister wanted mason drinking jars for Christmas. I found these on Amazon and ordered them because they were ""plain"". They didn't have any writing or logo on them. When I got them, I thought they looked small, but they are 16 ounces (although they don't look it). She loved them!"
2,"Nice unit, but","I really liked the design and size of the unit, but it was just not accurate. I have been monitoring my blood pressure for years and it has never been low. This unit gave me low readings most of the time. I liked the readings, but I know they were not true."
1,"Inaccurate, misleading","This monitor is off by at least 30. My BP is shown constantly normal using the monitor, but every visit to doctor office, or even the free BP monitors at drug stores telling total different stories. Some folks said it might be the proper way to use, e.g. relax hand, sit still with back supported, support front arm with heart level...etc etc. I believe I attempted the best possible position to use the monitor according to its manual, but the readings are still way off from reality. I do NOT recommend anyone to use it."
4,One of the Better Chan Films,"CHARLIE CHAN IN PARIS is one of the better entries in the Chan series. It is the tenth Charlie Chan film and the seventh in which Warner Oland plays the role of the venerable detective. It marks the first appearance of Keye Luke as Lee Chan, Charlie's number one son.Philip MacDonald wrote the screenplay. Earl Derr Biggers, the author of the six Charlie Chan books, had died in 1933."
3,Not for the amateur,"My goal in buying this book was to attempt a little self analysis and psychotherapy. Well, it's a great book I suppose but not for the amateur. I suspect it is required reading for graduate level mental health professionals.It's very readable however; nicely organized. I am just in over my head with this one!"
5,Excellent; A worthwhile read,"Our Inner Conflicts offers fascinating insight into the conflicts which frustrate all of us to some extent, as well as a look into the psychology of the people that tend to frustrate us. I have read this book several times over the years, and each time have taken away something new. While this book is not as detailed as Horney's Neurosis and Human Growth, it is certainly more accessible. I recommend reading them both."
4,Rendezvous,Rendezvous~ Jean-Michel Jarre is a very nice album from Jarre. The laser harp tracks are truly amazing and set the tone. Some of the sounds used on tracks like the fourth rendezvous sound very dated and as if he was using toy keyboards instead of the expensive keyboards listed on the album. It has definite vibes of the space music that he created on Equionoxe and some of the sounds harken back all the way back to Oxygene. Still I feel that it is not nearly as even or creative as his prior releases and one wonders aloud if he has become a bit lazy and creates just enough to sell albums instead of the masterworks of the past.
4,Great album,Got this to round out my Jean-Michael collection. I really like most of his work. You can build a cheap collection if you buy used. Just make sure to test the CD right away.
4,"Great for baking, but entrees bland by current standards","As would explain the disparate ratings here, I'd like to point out that the book dates from the late 19th Century. Despite updating, most of the entrees are of the bland, old WASP variety. In general, they are not spicy enough for cosmopolitan people used to ethnic foods. That said, it's a great resource for deserts/baked goods."
2,At best bland food.,"I am a 18 year old college student and novice cook. I was excited about this cookbook because of its reputation and comprehensiveness. But after trying 5 recipes that all stinked I found myself sorely disappointed and questioning my ability to cook. The family-favorite deemed recipe for Fish with Polenta and Spinach was horrible and gave my house a foul odor for 2 days. Fortunately, I tried other cookbooks and had more success. My boyfriend's mother received a copy of Fannie Farmer twenty years ago as a young bride and she did not have any success with it either. My recommendation of the Fannie Farmer Cookbook: stay away."
4,This is a good CD,"Jean Michel Jarre is an artist who gets ridiculed by some people in the music industry . It is unfair of them to think that because much of his material is outstanding and truly moving . This CD is no exception . Although having said that you can see why people tend to criticize him on this album . There is a couple of tracks on it where they don't get the imagination going and in the case of part 5 , it is an utter joke .... a horrible mess that sounds like it was played on some kid's toy piano . But other than that the album is very good but I would advise you to start elsewhere if you are thinking of buying a Jean Michel Jarre album"
3,First album to use digital synths,"Magnetic Fields is a highly charged studio album from the start of the eighties. It consists of 5 parts performed on new digital synths the ""Fairlight"" which Jarre was one of the first people to get his hands on. It's a good album, but one of Jarre's weakest studio turnouts.Magnetic Fields 2 is perhaps the most well known track from the album but sounds quite cheesy and along with part 5 (The Last Rhumba) are what bring the album down. Sound quality still sounds as bright and as energetic as anything made today - amazing."
4,Finally a Book that Focuses on Great Society Programs,"Andrew has written an interesting and informative book about some of the programs that created vital opportunities for indigent people to escape poverty. Andrew discusses the key laws Johnson passed to improve the lives of Americans, including Civil Rights Act of 1964, Medicaid, Medicare, Head Start and many others. As a historical account of legislative acts it is excellent, and on that point it deserves five stars. However, when Andrew discusses how the Great Society affect later laws, the book becomes quite week. In fact it seems like Andrew wrote the bulk of the work in the eighties and only later interspersed a few sentences about the nineties. The index is also a bit sparse and could have been more detailed. This book is, nevertheless, a good read and deserves the attention of persons interested in the Johnson administration."
4,The Great Society,"The book is quite comprehensive to be so small. I was expecting a big wordy book with a lot of adjectives but it turned out to be compact with about the right amount of detail to get the point across. Great reading for anyone that lived through the initial phases of the Great Society, especially in the southern states. It shows you how destructive social engineering is and how bad things can get when you grant priviledge and status to an underclass."
3,"""I'M GOING TO MAKE YOU BEAUTIFUL WITH THE BLOOD OF BRIDES""","As you know in the early forties Bela Lugosi was lesser known and Lon Chaney Jr. took over. Lugosi agreed to many poverty row films also known as ""quickies"". ""The corpse vanishes"" is one of them, Usually a quicky is dull and boring and bad acting! But this film is more enjoyable I think. It involves a mad doctor {Lugosi}, Who is trying to restore his old wife's youth. By doing this he must murder young brides and inject their blood into his wife's! Soon a police reporter notices that all the brides died from a rare flower, She traces the flower back to the mad doctor's house. Once spending a night in his old mansion she knows he is responsible for the deaths. But his wife's youth will not last forever, She consistantly needs new blood! Starring Bela Lugosi, Luana Walters, Tristrom Coffin, Elizabeth Russell and Frank Morgan. 64 minutes, Directed by Wallace Fox."
3,Monogram Madness,"Bela Lugosi gave his all in every film he made. ""The Corpse Vanishes,"" a 1942 Monogram quickie produced by Sam Katzman, is no exception. In this 64-minute gem, the horror icon plays Dr. Lorenz, a scientist who kidnaps young brides for the purpose of providing body fluids to restore the beauty of his 80-year-old wife. Bela is in his element - whether sleeping next to his wife in matching coffins or searching for new brides with his tiny assistant (Angelo Rossitto of ""Freaks"" fame). Elizabeth Russell stands out among the supporting players as the aging countess. Though the Lugosi Monograms are hardly classics, they remain a schlock lover's delight."
2,Don't bother,"Pre-80' accent spelling, and a lot of focus on that which leaves little room for actual beginner's inferences as goes grammar. Too many generalizing statements, that lead the beginner learner astray and do not leave room for exceptions as one goes further with study.I do not recommend this book."
1,Only worth the 'used' price,"I am Greek, someone who went through K-8 in Greece (but hardly paid attention in Grammar class). I thought this would give me a good memory jog. For my purposes, it was an OK book, but I would certainly not spend 5 bucks to get a new one. The book still uses the polytonic system (something no longer used in modern Greek), and there are some mis-translations in the book. The translations are technically correct, but not semantically correct. If you want a good, solid grammar book for Greek, this isn't it."
2,"okay, but some problems encountered","One annoying problem: when the mic is plugged into the iPod for more than a few minutes without recording, the iPod freaks out and freezes. You'll have to reset the iPod, pressing play and the middle button on the scroll wheel. Unless you are ready to record, don't plug the mic in. Quite annoying. I am not the only one who encountered this problem."
1,FALSE ADVERTISEMENT OF PRODUCT,"This product F8E462 is incorrectly advertised as to its iPod compatibility! If you are like me & numerous others that were duped into the purchase of this item thinking it was functional with iPod 2G (as is listed in the seller's item description), well then you should know that when you receive this product its packaging insert states that it is ONLY compatible with ""iPod 4G, 3G, photo"". So BEWARE of the false product description by this seller. Otherwise you will be stuck with an item you cannot use with your iPod 2G just like so many others of us!!!"
1,Beware of this product,"Not only does this product completely freeze your iPod if it's plugged in for more than a few minutes if you don't record anything, but the recording quality is AWFUL. Tons of static... can't hear anything. We ordered & returned THREE of these Belkin voice recorders just to make sure the product is as bad as it seems to be."
3,Good for musicians,"This was the first Beatles book I ever bought, and it nearly put me off them for life.This book is or musicians only!I don't say that because the book is bad - it isn't - but it's very focused on the musicianship. General readers who approach this with a mind to finding out the meaning behind the songs, or the history of the band, will be sorely disappointed. Riley concentrates almost entirely on the musical structure. That is great if you are playing along on your guitar, but not if you're tone deaf like me.So I recommend you steer clear of this book if you don't know your semi-quavers from your elbow. But if you know what he's talking about, then it's probably a great read."
4,the first of many,this was the first readable analysis of the beatles music which deserves to be updated. this is a crowded field these days but reilly was the first and for that he should recieve congratulations.heisnt afraid to take the beatles to task for any misteps they might have taken along the way and his comments on beatle literature are insightful and right on the mark.
2,How serious can you get?,"Remember that famous review of ""Not a Second Time"" which mentioned ""aeolian cadencies"" and the like? Now imagine ALL Beatles songs analyzed in that sort of language! And each and every lyric - even the simple ones from their early years - scrutinized word by word? How much can you read into a lyric like ""She Loves You""? I think not even the Beatles themselves took their music that seriously."
1,My mistake.,The pokemon on the sides are not fake. They are:Paras(left)And Parasect(right).(I think.) They still look phony!
1,"I don't like this book I think it is fake,",I know about all 151 Pokemon and the Pokémon on the cover are not real.I haven't read the book but judging from the fake Pokémon cover this could be a fake Pokémon book.
3,"Relatively decent, pared down Powell","During Powell's years in Paris in the 1960s, he continued to play and perform, occasionally emerging with solid recordings (""Don Byas/Bud Powell-A Tribute to Cannonball"", Dexter Gordon- ""Our Man in Paris"", ""Bud Powell in Paris"", etc.). While still formidable, Powell's playing during this period was pared down. The jaw dropping and otherworldly pre-1953 brilliance was evident only occasionally. Replacing it was a more spare, more Monk-like sound and approach, a tendency for slow and medium tempos and very little left hand. This recording is a good example. A flash of the old Powell on ""52nd St Theme"". The late Powell everywhere else."
4,Delightfully witty,Kinley MacGregor is a spirited new voice in adventure romance. The delightfully witty repartee between Serenity and Morgan will bring a smile to your lips; their sexual tension and adventures will keep you glued to the page. Keep your eye on Ms. MacGregor.
5,This book is one of the best I've ever read,"I didn't want to put it down! I loved the wit, sense of adventure and compelling story. When a book can make me laugh, cry and feel good, that is the kind of book I want to enjoy reading again and again and never want to give up. I have many books in my library, and this one will definitely be well used. Thank you for the pleasure of reading!"
1,You'll find yourself skimming this one.,"Why do so many books meant to ""inspire"" teachers end up sounding the same? And why do so many of them take 150 pages to convey information that, at best, might be the basis of an article? Intrator's book is one of these; you'll find yourself skimming after the first fifty pages. One of the arguments of the book is the importance of engaging students in their study of literature by connecting it to their own lives. Another is the importance of treating students with respect and acknowledging their ideas. Kind of obvious, huh? If you need this book, get it used."
3,original was better,"One of my friends has this copy, I have the imported one which is the original track list. This one has a few remixes instead of the original versions, which really, the original versions are better then the remixes.Zoolook itself is a very intellegent album that Jarre has done, he did a lot of exploring in this one.Later."
4,Ground-breaking...for the time,"One of the pioneering releases which introduced samplers to a wider public. I was only about 16 at the time and I remember at first hating and then growing to love this album. Interestingly it is the non-sampled elements of this music which sound the most dated today while many of the sampled sounds still sound quite fresh.One thing I've noticed is that many children LOVE ""Blah Blah Cafe"" (2nd to last track). Put it on the stereo at a birthday party full of 5-year olds and watch them go wild!"
5,Talented,"This album really opens my mind to an unexplainable realm. I am an artist (in my own mind) and this album is definaetly music to draw to, because I draw abstract and his music is very abstract. This album is good as far as Im concerned, hmmm ok thats it."
2,The BEST Jarre Album,"As a teenager, I listened to Jean-Michel Jarre's music endlessly. My first concert was one of his, and anyone else's work was, well, just not worth listening to. Equinoxe was then, and remains, his best work.So why only two stars? Well, in retrospect, I can now see that I fawned over my JMJ tapes not because they were good, but because I didn't know any better. The reality is that anyone with a decent synth and editor could cobble this kind of stuff together in their back bedroom. You can't even say it was ahead of its time, as plenty of other artists were using the technology.The best track is probably #5, which opens with the crack of thunder and downpour of rain. It's a shame the rest of the album isn't more ambient or I might still have been listening to it."
4,From a novice POV...,"I searched high and low for a copy of ""The Divine Nine"" in my area in hopes of learning more about all of the black greek letter organizations. Having no direct affiliation, I hoped that the book would give me valuable information in my hunt for the right organization for me. I was so hungry for information that I read the book in its entirety in about 2 days. I was not disappointed. Despite the fact that interjecting segments (ie. Tidbits, Famous Brothers/Sorors) were somewhat distracting, this did not deter me from getting what I ahd planned to from the book. I highly recommend ""The Divine Nine"" to anyone who is even beginning to think of joining a black greek letter organization!"
5,The Divine Nine: The History of African American Fraternities and Sororities,"I think the transaction was wonderful. I received the book in a timely fashion and it looked brand new, no torn pages, highlighted pages... exactly as it was described."
3,GREAT BUT NOT EXCELLENT,"I ENJOYED THE BOOK AND IT WAS HELPFUL. HOWEVER, I WOULD HAVE ENJOYED IT MORE IF ROSS WOULD HAVE VARIED THE QUESTIONS HE ASK THE CHAPTERS INSTEAD OF THE SAME QUESTIONS EVERY SINGLE TIME. IN ADDITION THERE WERE MANY ERRORS THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN TAKING CARE OF BEFORE PUBLISHING. IN SAYING ALL THIS I STILL INTEND ON PASSING THE KNOWLEDGE OF THIS BOOK ON TO OTHERS CAUSE I STILL FOUND IT VERY HELPFUL."
4,"Cute costume, but a snug fit","I bought this costume for my soon-to-be 4 year old daughter for halloween. Since she is taking ballet and loves dress-up, I figured she could continue to use the costume for play. The costume is well-made and a good valude for the price. At first I was disappointed with the wings, which looked sort of wilted. But, the benefit is that she could easily wear a coat without removing them, since they are so flexible. My only real complaint is that the size is misleading. My daughter only weighs 31 pounds and 4T clothing is often too big. But this 4-6X was actually a bit snug worn by itself. It was very cold on halloween and she had to wear an undershirt and shirt underneath, which made the costume even tighter. Part of that is the design of the bodice, which is spandex and the sewn on panty (leotard style). I really don't see how it would fit her if she were wearing size 5 or 6 clothes. But, my daughter loves the costume and is still playing with it."
2,Just okay,This item is just okay. Not exactly as pictured but close. My biggest complaint is with the wings. They are so small on the actual costume and they don't stand up like the picture. Also the tutu is made of very soft material so it does not puff up.
5,The Chronicles of Narnia,"Great movie, my son loves it. It's nice to have something other than regular Disney characters out there - and a classic at that! I would highly recommend."
1,wrong item sent,"Am trying to return this. I wanted the book, not DVD. Never herd from either you ORE the seller. Somebody please help.Mary Jones"
5,Wonderful movie!,"This blue ray disc is a must buy! Not only is the movie amazing, the quality that the blue ray adds is astounding!"
5,"Great movie, even better special effects","This movie is based on the book of the same title. The movie fills in some of the original story that is untold. Very little of the original novel is different from the movie. The special effects were amazing and breath taking in parts. While this is a childrens movie, the story line is easy and fun to follow for any age. This was one of the best movies ever based off a novel. Viewers do not walk away thinking ""What book was this movie based on?"""
5,Great for Narnia Lovers,"Good Gift for any Narnia Lover. However not the pack to get for someone who may not like, or hasn't seen the movie/read the book. Disc One has the movie, commentary, and bloopers. It also has the extended version with additional scenes. Disc Two- In depth look at the worlds of Narnia.Disc Three- About C.S. Lewis the man who created Narnia.Disc Four- Behind the Battle, Art, and Visuals. Comes with nice case. [...]"
2,Under cooked!!,"Am I the only one that thinks this looks like straight to DVD Disney fluff!! It is for sure a children's movie.. nothing here for adults I just came to find out! The effects are under cooked.. this includes the unfinished looking make-up, set decor, CGI, ect.. oh and dont forget the bad green screen. Just not impressed what so ever! So to end this right now I say.. if you have preschoolers to entertain.. go for it but, they will proberly get bored. So who is this movie made for?"
4,Narnia,I loved the movie and the battle seen oh that was the best battle seen and the stone place that was cool too I would go see it again and again and again
5,Narnia Rules!,"I have to say that this film was tops for my 11 year old daughter and me. The talking animals were depicted so lifelike and the script stuck close to the original book. I enjoyed the BBC mini-series of the Chronicles of Narnia that came out many years ago and would still recommemd it for children under 9, as this film had slightly more real looking scarey creatures who served the white witch. I will definitely see this again before it leaves the theaters!"
2,Not that great,"I didn't find this movie entertaining at all, but then I've never been a huge fan of CS Lewis' stories. The special effects were okay, but the plot didn't seem to move very well and I never felt for the characters the way I did watching Lord of the Rings."
2,chronicles of borenia,"I don't know what all the hype is about. I watched the first 48 minutesof this movie. It's slow, predictable, poorly written, with inauthentic characters. The children interact like robots and transmit no real excitement, curiousity, or surprise. The story about the lost king and evil snow queen seems terribly simplistic and well-trodden. This screenplay has to be a disservice to Lewis' work. Stone cold dull."
1,wait for the extended version,"Don't waste your time on this Blu-Ray one, wait for the Blu-Ray of the extended release. Worth it."
4,Chronicles of Narnia,Overall the movie is quite good and conveys Lewis's story line. The added / altered scenes (such as the flight of the children with Mr. and Mrs. Beaver) are not need but do not retract too much from the original story.
2,Barbie-Narnia: No soul and too short,"Comparing to the older UK TV series this is dull business. The actors are too perfectionistic, they are almost boasting of their acting skills. The story is cut short. The story is less true to C.S. Lewis poetic ""message"" or inner world. And the effects just add an effect to this dull movie, like plastic on a plastic cake called Barbie-Narnia. I am laughing.Sincerly,A norwegian"
4,Better late than never,"I'm very well satisfied with the DVD, however it did arrive late. The original order never made it thanks to USPS but imediately upon contacting customer service at Amazon they got a replacement sent out to me. The long and short of it is that I'm satisfied both with the product and with Amazon's customer service and not real happy with USPS."
3,Thank goodness it was a free rental,"I love the Narnia books, but I was disappointed. not because of any plots changes or anything, but just because it could have been so much better. I guess being a british kid doesn't mean you can act. The acting was just horrible (especially Lucy). It could have been saved if they had directed the movie with some dramatic sense, but it just never really got fast paced or exciting. The entire first half of the final battle was scored with music that was underwhelming. Perhaps most will like it, but if you're a discerning movie fan, be prepared for an underwhelming experience (and long at almost 2:30). Still, I imagine kids will love it, which is all that matters in the end, isn't it? :)"
5,An Epic Tale,"This classic, beloved C.S. Lewis novel comes to life on the big screen. Unlike with most movies this follows the book seamlessly. A wonderfully directed classic fully alive with breath taking effects and plenty of action. This movie is a perfect complimentary addition to the classic novel I recommend it for children and adults alike"
2,"the lion, the witch, and the wardrobe is a good movie","the lion the witch and the wardrobe;is a good movie for people who look for advinture, action and talking animals u should see this movie because if u don't then your missing all those thing's I siad."
3,It's done well enough.,"It's done well enough, but like most of C.S. Lewis' writings or J.R.R. Tolkien's, the books are far better if you have even half an imagination. The movie spoils that part of it for me. Also the fact, that they only have the one from the series completed yet, and like most everything C.S. Lewis or J.R.R. Tolkien wrote, you need to read the set to understand the message and story fully."
4,Unfair to compare it to Rings,"The first book in the Chronicles of Narnia series, the Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe takes us to a magical land of talking beasts, enchanted forests, a mysterious but benevolent lion, and an evil witch who rules with an eternal winter. It is up to four young people to stop her so Narnia can be freed of her tyranny.I absolutely loved this film and I think Adamson did a great job showcasing the magic of New Zealand. The battle scenes are terrific, especially the sequence involving the griffons, which I thought was extremely original. Thankfully, we don't see a lot of blood because of the Disney nature of the film but I can forgive them for that.I do have to admit that I don't think it's on the same level as the Lord of the Rings. Unfortunately, any fantasy film made today will always be compared to Jackson's masterpiece. Still, Narnia makes an admirable effort and should be considered a classic among the Disney features."
5,"AWESOME, must-have for any Narnia fan!!!!","If I could give it more than 5 stars, I certainly would! I'm a pretty big Narnia fan, and very much enjoyed the extra footage offered in this version. One of the DVDs in this 4-disc set is loaded with information on the man who wrote the book the film is based on, C. S. Lewis. It comes in a really nice box that would be great for gift-giving, too.Definitely has a place of honor on my DVD shelf. :-)"
3,I will watch anything that has Tilda Swinton in it.,"I am not a huge fan of children's fantasy movies. I didn't even care to watch anymore Harry Potter after the first two. I did enjoyed Narnia, because it's a visually stunning film and it's got great action and special effects all over. I am a huge fan of Tilda Swinton and have seen most of her stuff since Orlando, but her best work is still The Deep End. I love her icy mysterious looks, very glamorous and powerful. Her porcelain dool face is perfect to play the witch, and she's proven to be a very versatile actress. I also enjoyed the limited participation of Jim Broadbent, who's probably the most overexposed British actor these days, but he's an amazing actor, and I also loved him Art School Confidential. I can't believe enjoyed a children's film."
2,Well... I bet the president liked it.,It looked like recycled garbage from other fantasy movies with a spoonful of christianity crammed down our throat.This is why you RENT the dvd before you waste ten dollars at the threater or thirty dollars buying it.1 star for the Lord of the Rings which without this movie would be nothing and 1 star to all of the video stores around the world that have saved people hundreds of dollars on boring junk they will soon forget.
4,"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch & the Wardrobe","Not in HD, which was disappointing, but price was so much cheaper that VUDU. Grandkids enjoyed it and that's what counts"
5,I love this edition!,"I love this Bible edition because of the added devotional readings accompanying almost every chapter. The readings give added meaning to the chapters and are relative to todays world. They also make an excellent basis for Bible study group discussions. Most are written by well-known Christian writers such Debby Boone, Ruth Graham, and Luci Swindoll. I would reccommend this editon to anyone looking for a new Bible."
4,It's good theatre. And I love theatrics.,All three of them tell a good story. Naraya does a wonderful job of the story of Solome (if I spelled it right?!!). I have not use it for any training purposes yet. But maybe when I get some more technique that I seek on a daily bases. Watching Darshan made me go out side at night and dance my prayers.
3,Ambient water music,"Waiting for Cousteau sounds very ""digital"" all the instruments used are very clean and sharp. The first 3 parts, Calpyso 1,2,3 are fine if slightly cheesy. A lot of people complain about the 46 minute ""Waiting for Cousteau"" track being so long and slow but it's the highlight of the album. To me, it's the most thoughtful and relaxing piece of music I've heard and an interesting departure for Jarre."
5,One of his best,"especially the log melody ""En attendant Cousteau"" will provide you with endless hours of relaxation and posibly meditation too."
3,not what I expected,"I was looking for something that would help my ESE students comprehend algebra in a different way. This book is nearly as tedious as the textbook, with very few different approaches to solving the problems than those presented in the textbook. We stayed with the textbook version."
3,Press To Play - Paul McCartney,"Not the best Paul album, but has a couple of very good songs. Paul tries a techno sound on some songs working with Eric Stewart. Only one of those worked very well, Pretty Little Head. There are two superb songs on this CD that have a more traditional Paul sound, Only Love Remains and Once Upon A Long Ago. Both were top 40 hits in the UK with Once Upon A Long Ago going Top 10."
1,One Good Song,"This album only has one good thing about it, ""Spies Like Us"". I would never have bought this album if it didn't have ""Spies Like Us"" on it, because I could not find this song any where or I would have bought the soundtrack or a compilation that had the song. ""Press Play"" is a OK song other than that the album is a dud."
3,Pretty good,"This album is okay. Not on of my favorite Paul albums though. I do however like it more than ""Wild Life"" and ""Pipes of Peace"". Still though, as I look at the track list a bunch of the songs stand out to me."
5,oxygene,"i purchased this 8-track when it first cam out and wanted to hear the remastering of this album, still trippy and the sound was exellent,loved it"
5,Absolutely Mind Blowing!!!!,Absolutely Mind Blowing!!!! Total Trance-out! Another world. I usually listen to Pink Floyd and Psychedelic 60s and stuff like that but then I found this Jean Michel Jarre artist and was shocked. Equinoxe is another great album. I think this one is more detailed in spaceyness. Well hope this review helped out.
5,Obra poética.,"Example 1: ""Un cuerpo, un cuerpo solo, sólo un cuerpo,/un cuerpo como día derramado/y noche devorada"". Example 2: ""Lates entre la sombra/blanca y desnuda: río."" Octavio Paz is one of the first voices of the xxth century mexican poetry. He is the most important blend between clasicism and the modern trends in poetical expresion. He lived in France and thus, he experienced surrealism and mingled with the likes of Breton, Éluard, et al. In México he estimulated the literary critic and reviews to new standars of excelence. Read O. Paz."
4,The only brush that works,"I have a standard Yorkie and they not only have hair, but fur underneath that hair especially on the rump area.This is the only brush that will remove the fur that is starting to mat from underneath.The pins do fall out after a while and the brush will not last forever, but should last at least a year, so get more than one. I normally brush my dog once or twice a day as he has two acres to frolic in and gather weeds all over himself; he does have a good time at it.The brushing is usually done outside or in a room without a carpeted floor just for the above stated reasons."
3,Does not work for my shorthair,"I can't rate this product with zero stars as its probably my fault for not knowing better, but this brush does not work whatsoever on/for my short haired Shep/Terr mix."
3,"Sized Right, But White is Still Thin","I bought the white tank top for part of a costume project, and was hoping that, based on the details and reviews, it would be of thicker material than a typical undershirt. Unfortunately, the white one is only marginally thicker than an undershirt.While I am not all that modest or a prude by any stretch of the imagination, out of respect for the public, I would not wear the white by itself out in public. With my darker skin tone, it is nearly see-through.Sizing is true-to-size, at least."
5,Great tank-top..but buy size small if you wear medium..,Very well-made tank-tops but they run larger than the size listed..and they don't shrink in the wash..The colors don't fade either..I live in South Florida and wear tank-tops all the time. I know a quality made one.. Well worth the price.
1,Prepare to modify your battery,"At $8.95, when similar generics are $30+, I guess I can't complain too much.I can only speak for the Pentax Optio WP (5mp version). The TechPower batteries seemed to come DOA after an overnight charge on each (I bought two). I was about to return them I decided to try something. I inserted a battery into my camera, and wedged in a tiny piece of paper over the battery and closed the battery door. Sure enough, it worked.The contacts on the TechPower are almost less then a millimeter shorter than my other Optio 3rd party and OEM batteries. But it was enough to cause the batteries not to connect.So I cut a few strips from a pizza box (little thicker, and locks the battery in better), and set it on top each time I put the battery in. So far so good."
3,"15 pounds worth, could be clearer","I took 3 hours this past weekend to quickly read through this one and decided to send it back. Each of the sections doesn't work with the others & I didn't find the sample applications very helpful. It's got a great deal of information, it just needs to be organized more clearly."
5,Great,The Matza crackers we ordered came very fsat and were fresh as if I had bought them in a store
5,Multifaceted vocalist,"If you like Jazz in all his genres, you will appreciate her last release. The first half of the album is Smooth Jazz, the second half more classic Jazz. A nice mixture for those, loving both.HBH"
4,Not her best...but,"Jean is one fantastic talent! She can put any female singer to shame. Of course she never got the credit she should have, but true fans know. Ms. Carne's best work was on the Philly Int. label."
1,Not worth the time,"Although this book displays the civil war prejudice and hardships people of that time endured, this book is not worded and written in a way that you are just engrossed in reading the text. When I read a book, I have to be interested in it from the get-go. When reading this book, you'll have to be patient for it to become the least bit interesting."
3,Good for when your angry,"Having seen these guys on 'Later' and having quite enjoyed them (even though the lead singer thinks he is Mick Jagger) decided to buy their album. It is good for when your angry, just turn up and let the raw guitars play. Unfortunately, I believe that after a while the songs get a bit repetitive and turn into a mass of noises. Personally I prefer The Strokes."
1,Credibility,"One of the authors of this book is Mr. Philip Watts, chairman of Shell until 2003. He left the company after it was revealed that under his mandate, Shell has inflated its oil reserves by 20%, with his knowledge and influence. Although the book seems consistent and based on real facts, his presence as an author make it a bit unreliable. I did not realize he is one of the authors. If I knew it, I would never buy it. Check ""Chapter 2 - The Right Framework"", particulalrly the item ""Transparency and Accountability"" and then check the reports on Mr Watts' activities and behaviour at Shell. How can one trust on what reads??"
5,Yes!,These are the best-tasting protein bars I've had. And the CLIF brand gives me confident that they are also healthy (at least compared to the competition). 20g is a lot and I really look forward to having one before an hour of basketball.
1,Did not like Vanilla Almond at all,"This item arrived and it was not past it's due date... but it sure tasted like it was! It did not taste like vanilla or almond. It was more like a chalky, powdered whey flavor with a layer of goo on top. The worst bar I have ever had. I've tried and enjoyed many bars, even the less palate-friendly high-protein ones. Thumbs down to the vanilla almond!"
4,Clif Bar Builder's Bar Vanilla Almond 12 Count,The vanilla almond flavor is my favorite builder bar. I am already placing my second order for these. Perfect as a meal replacement when I only have a minute or two spare to eat.
4,HUSBAND'S STAPLE,WE LOVE THE CLIFF PEANUT BUTTER BARS BUT WERE EXCITED TO SEE THE ADDED PROTEIN IN THE BUILDER BARS! WE HAVE THESE ON SUBSCRIPTION!!
4,Great protein bar,"I eat 3 to 4 of these a week and the subscribe and save price makes it usually cheaper than buying locally. The taste is very good, protein is high, carbs could be lower but I know that is not easy to do."
1,BEWARE,"I had been purchasing Clif bars for awhile thru Amazon with no problem. I ended up throwing away my last order...I had ordered in August 2009, but didn't need to open box until end of Sept (past the return date). All 3 boxes in the order EXPIRED in 2008 ! I opened a few individual bars - they were dried up and made a mess! My error in not checking order immediately."
5,power bars,"They are great, eat 1-2 a dayClif Bar Builder's Bar, Peanut Butter, 2.4-Ounce Bars, Pack of 12"
3,"Bars are Great, But Arrived Melted!","Clif's Builder's Bars are great, and Peanut Butter and Cookies and Cream are arguably the best flavors. Unfortunately, I ordered two boxes and they took over two weeks to arrive and had obviously melted then reformed in their wrappers due to poor temperature handling by Amazon or their affiliate merchant.Hopefully Amazon can resolve these issues in the future!"
5,My preferred Builder's Bar flavor.,"Convenient and tasty meal supplement/after gym snack. Product gets five stars, though purchasing this online was more expensive than buying at grocery store (available at Wegmans 12/12 for $1.20/bar vs. $1.58/bar, with the option of mixing and matching flavors)."
2,"20g Sugar, too much!","It tastes great and fills you up, but it's loaded with sugar. Two out of top three ingredients are syrups. A candy Snicker bar (junk food) has 13g sugar, this one has 20g sugar.For muscle recovery, I've switched from this tothinkThin Protein Bar, Chunky Peanut Butter, Gluten Free, 10 - 2.1-Ounce Bars. ThinkThin uses sugar alcohol instead of conventional sugar. Google sugar alcohol, if you're not familiar with it. And ThinkThin use whey protein as a part of its protein blend. Whey protein is the best protein for muscle recovery.The best protein bars for muscle recovery are homemade, it's super easy to make (a bit messy). There are a tone of recipes on the net."
2,Melted during shipping?,"Although these bars have been a favorite of my husband and I, the two boxes that were shipped to us were so crumbly, we couldn't open the package without a napkin underneath. And, the taste just wasn't as fresh as buying them off the shelf. We love the fact that these bars don't have the bad ingredients a number of other bars have, and we love that the bars fill the appetite void, but the freshness and crumbling state will probably cause us to rethink buying them through Amazon, even though it is cheaper than buying them off the shelf."
5,Great. Tried all but Lemon,"Peanut Butter ... 5 stars. Others (didn't try lemon) 4.5 stars. More fiber than PowerBar Protein Plus but more fat & sugar and less protein, though the price for a 12 bar box from the bulk retailers is proportionate to the protein content. I'll update this after I've tried the PowerBars. Solid products."
2,Heat Damaged,I really like these bars. I eat one everyday with a piece of fruit. My wife ordered them online with Amazon because of the price. While it was cost effective and convenient to have them delivered right to our door the bars were a bit heat damaged. We will not order this type of product on Amazon again.
2,Don't buy unless you like the taste,"I couldn't take the mint it has...may be good product, but I would buy after tasting it. Too late to realize that they don't have return policy on this."
3,Great Tasting Bar,I am now worried about high amount of arsenic in brown rice syrup used in this product.Cliff should switch back to normal sugar
5,"Excellent taste, excellent food.","I've tried a lot of protein bars in my day and have never been very happy with the flavor, texture and ingredients until I found the Clif bars, especially the chocolate, I actually enjoy eating it!"
5,superbly written and factual,The author describes the development of mountain sources of water and the tunnels and ditches that brought it to the sugar plantations. Then she weaves in the history of the sugar industry which changed the subsistence economy of the Hawaiians forever and brought Hawaii into the modern world. While doing this skillfully in a clear style she also weaves in much of the history of the islands. If you have any interest in Hawaii the book will fascinate you.
3,Fromm my but!,"It's NOT Fromm. It's Illinous razor strop company. Decent strop, a bit longer and wider than the import russian leather ones. Needs a fair amount of strop dressing to soften it though.Good performer in spite of that though. My primary one, this one is a gift to a friend. Disappointed in the misadvertisement of the brand though!"
4,Good historic reference,There are modern books that are more practical but this guy is the father of beekeping and anyone interested in the art should read it even if it is out of curiosity.
2,They don't stick,"These look really nice and the size was just right, but the two big ones peeled right off and blew away in the wind while I was riding - the same day I put them on. My motorcycle is black, maybe the plastic got too hot in the Brazilian sun, or maybe the glue is just too weak. The medium ones hasn't come off so far though, after more than a month. I'm glad they were cheap."
1,Who wants what where?,"Just a quick word to warn the silent film fans to stay away. The film is almost nonexistent - there's no the slightest hint of any kind of direction, and if there are good actors, the copy is so miserable that you just won't be able to see. It's a mediocre story of a woman and a bad, corrupt man, and somehow the moral seems to be ""Votes for Women!"". How it ever got there, beats me, since my attention faded very soon. Too bad."
2,Dated and condescending,"This book does have a little useful cultural and historical information but the author's biting criticisms of the culture made me wince as I read it. Can you say arrogant American? (Although he writes as if he was British.) I don't understand why, if he hated the country so, he stayed there so long. Buyer beware: although the publication date is 2008, it appears to merely be a reprint of the original 2004 without edits. There is no indication as to when he made his observations of Japan. Case in point: the book talks about using AOL for internet service and how mobile phones are gaining in popularity. I've traveled in Japan in 2009 and 2010 and it is not the backwards country he makes it sound like. I would look elsewhere if you want a less biased but more informative book on Japanese culture."
2,Disconnect Switch Poor Design,"After waiting with much anticipation, I was so very disappointed to see that the disconnect switch was broken off. After inspecting the broken switch, I see that it is plastic inside the phone and metal only covers the visible part. Too bad what a poor design. The phone is really quite nice looking. But because of this flaw I will not order another and do not recommend this item."
1,What a shame.....,"We just bought this for our twins and only two of the cards work correctly. It's obvious by the others who reviewed this product that this toy just plain DOESN'T WORK!! It's too bad I didn't see this review before I purchased it, I will be returning it. This toy needs to come off the shelf and be redesigned because it could be a great toy! (if it worked!)"
1,doesn't work,I'm another person with the same problem. It only reads one card and I'm going to try and return it even though it was a gift and I don't have the receipt. It seems like it would be fun if it worked.
1,Recipes don't work,"I found this pretty-looking book in a used book store for a quarter. It looked brand new. The photographs are lovely, and the varieties endless (500? What more could you want?) So I wondered. What was it doing in a used book store? I found out fast. The recipes don't work. Maybe 500 recipes are too many to test. The measurements are off, making the batter too thick or too runny. Other times, whole steps are left out. It tells you to chop dried apricots, for example, but never mentions them again, so you're not sure whether to add them to the batter early, or at the very end (if you remember to add them at all). Steer clear of this book. Better 25 tried and true recipes than 500 flawed ones that waste precious time and money."
2,A great idea... but fails,"I bought this book over a year ago, thrilled at the thought of 500 cupcake recipes. I'd read the reviews which stated there were a lot of muffin recipes, but I was ok with that- they're not cupcakes, but I do like a good muffin now and then. There are some great ideas in this book, with a lot of flavor combinations that I never would have thought of.However, my gripe with the book is that I have yet to have a recipe turn out well. They are almost always dry and tasteless. I have been baking for many years, especially cupcakes, so I know my technique is not the issue. I haven't yet nailed down what the problem with the recipes is, but I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone, unless you're just looking for some inspiration."
3,Slayer freak,"This is the worst allbum they ever done, the songs is to short like 1 minute,but i like it anyways u can hear that it's slayer, they have never done a bad allbum but this is pretty close, but give it a try anyways! what can i say i'm a slayer freak so a bought it!"
1,WHY?,"WHY DO PEOPLE LISTEN TO SLAYER? BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE RETARDED!! EVERY ALBUM SLAYER PUT OUT SUCKED, AND THIS RIGHT HERE IS THE WORST ALBUM EVER MADE!! CONGRATULATIONS, SLAYER JUST WON AN AWARD FOR WORST BAND EVER!!!METALLICA RULES"
4,4 stars for the album 5 stars for Gemini,"This is a good album but i recommend if you are just getting into slayer do not start with this album. most of the songs are remakes done as only slayer can do them, but what makes this album great is the last track Gemini it starts out slow and heavy and the intro is long enough to get you into a groove and then if takes off and rocks like only slayer can and it is even more brutal live, but then what slayer song isn't live."
5,Recommended,"One of the best Jarre compilations, this features some of his best tunes (Chronologie 2, 3 and the outstanding Chronologie 4, Oxygene, Equinoxe, Magnetic Fields and so on), as well as completely unique bits and pieces. Jarre's music is always refreshingly orginal, and this CD is both atmospheric and uplifting."
1,what good is cookbook with incorrect ingredient lists?,"I am not Korean, but my dear friend is. She doesn't have any written recipes, so I bought this to try to learn some of the great things she made while we were roomates.Well, the seaweed soup recipe calls for so much seaweed that it's ludicrous and possibly physically impossible to get that much dried seaweed in that amount of water. Luckily I was able to call my friend for help.The second recipe I tried, for bulgogi, had no where near the amount of seasoning one would typically use... based on my friend & on many korean restaurants I've been to.Did she just not pay attention when writing these recipes? The ingredients are correct, and the stories are nice, but the directions and quantities are way off."
1,Contents is different from what the title says.,I do not recommend this book to any programmer. Its more suited for business or executive person to decide on what technology to use. Hardly any programming snippets.
3,Seems to give consistently low readings,"This blood pressure monitor is easy to use and has lots of nice features. However, it seems to be giving me consistently low blood pressure readings. My arm is small (~8.5"" in circumference), but still within the recommended arm sizes for the monitor. I've compared the readings for this monitor with my doctor's as well as other blood monitor devices that friends own, and it seems to be low by about 10-20 for each reading? This makes me think I can't really trust it's results, and this would be really bad for someone that actually has high blood pressure as you may get a false sense that things are going ok when they are not. I plan to see if I can return/exchange this one in case it's just this particular one that is defective or something."
3,"Highly entertaining, but falls short on the philosophy side","For anyone who enjoys being surprised by little facts, this book is wonderful. Don't expect too much on the philosophical side, however - the book brings a lot of old and rather superficial views as if they were new finds, and definitely falls short on defending them against the critiques that have accumulated in time. If you are knowledgeable in the issues that is probably no problem, but it would be a pity if a non-philosophically-versed reader came out with the impression that this is the level at which philosophers were dealing.Forget about the word ""philosophy"", and think of it as ""musings of an intelligent layman on the big whys in life"", and you have a wonderful book that will set your thoughts off on unexpected track after unexpected track.So, with the caveat about the word ""philosophy"", if you are in the general Gardner/Hofstadter corner of taste, you'll enjoy this!"
4,Nice reading...,"It is a very nice book to read and it spans an enormous variety of topics, facts and ideas.Since the books, in fact, is a collection of more or less loosely related essays, it's difficult to discuss all of them as a whole, though, in general, the book is a very amusing reading.However, amusing as it may be, the book lacks a dedication to a clearly defined set of ideas and as a result it lacks a kind of depth that a more serious reader would desire. (BTW, I think it's typical of Gardner's books: width and variety at the expence of some depth).Still I've read and re-read this book for a number of times and enjoyed it again and again."
5,Great starter kit for kids,"Great for home cuts for kids.Moms, do you really want to spend 25+ dollars for akids cut at a hair place? Unless you need styling for girls cut, this is the one for your little man. Easy to use. GReat way to learn on easy kids cut. So you can cut your husbands as well and save $20 a month. MAKE SURE YOU HAVE A CHILD THAT WILL CO-OPERATE WITH YOU! Make it into a game. Great for touch ups as well. I use it for my side burns and triming the sides. Nice ans small, easy to use.Good Luck to you!"
2,Not what i expected,"I wish i'd looked through this in a bookstore before purchasing. I'm a fan of his other two books, but this one was disappointing overall. Not enough info to justify the price, and much of what's there is already in his other book. I'm not sure that I will be motivated to actually use this book as the author intended."
3,Not pleased with the publisher of this book,I am writing this not to review this book as such...... I found the quality of the story very well written and extremely interesting...... But The quality of the publishing had a lot to be desired. I bought 5 books all published by Kappa Books Inc. and all of them had so many errors that I was disappointed in reading them. I have spent over 3 hours trying to find a web address for this company so I could ask them personaly for an explaination but my search has been fruitless.Thank you for the time. Josee
5,It's an Inexpensive Component Cable for Wii,"There isn't much to this product: it worked for me without any fuss, and made my Wii's picture look better, at the console's full 480p. It is much less expensive than the official brand cable, and I have been using it for a few weeks without any issues. This purchase seemed a little bit risky, due to bad reviews of off-brand HD cables, but it was a good choice."
1,So much for so little. . .,"I looked high and low for a functional traffic light for my son. This was the first ""non-train set"" light I could find. Priced at more than $30 - I assumed it would be operational or battery powered. Instead it is cumbersome to operate and nearly kills the fun that it was supposed to create. If this toy was priced appropriately it would have cost less than $15. Its over priced and under functional. This purchase made me feel totally taken advantage of and my son's not too happy about it either."
5,LOVE THIS SHOW,"There's not too many shows these days that a family can watch together, but ""My Wife & Kids"" is a great one. It arrived on time. I ordered Season 1 and I had to have Season 2. Will they be coming out with the rest of the seasons of this show....I REALLY HOPE SO."
3,Just okay.,"Bought these because they are one a few phthalate free dinosaur toys. They look nice. The moveable legs are fun, but the moveable jaws fall off all the time. Pretty frustrating for my 4 year old, she won't play with them anymore. I wouldn't buy these again."
5,that one kid,"ok, this album is that one kid. you know, you're 26 or 27 and you go to a house show at your friends' house. and at the show there is a high school kid whom no one seems to know who is staging an enormous, beautiful and breathtaking play; a theatrical production on a shoestring budget that nobody in your town has seen the likes of. And this play instantly puts everyone else's work to shame, casting a light of sincerity and imagination on the show that is inescapable.Immediately, the scenesters and post modern elite begin telling everyone, especially the beautiful girls, everything that is wrong with this kid's play, desperately trying to ignore and draw attention away from the simple truth of the situation. That is, that this kid has made something so gorgeous and honest in world that least expected it.This album is that kid."
2,front floor liner,"floor liner with ""tray"" effect keeping getting cauht and my foot as my foot enters vehicles. After one week, I replaced the floor liner."
5,wtf is going on?,"At first I thought I though KA had gotten the worst ghost writer ever.Then I realized she was a freakin genius. Or they were. Or whatever.This book is TOTALLY awesome. Insane, hilarious and also really interesting. One of my favorite Animorphs ever."
5,Exciting book,This exciting book starts when Keith Steadman drops the winning pass. He decides not to play football anymore because he feels like a loser. He has nightmares every night about the dropped pass. It is a good story because it shows how he overcomes his mistake with his family's help. I think you should read this book to find out more!
3,Football Nightmare Review,"Have your nightmares ever haunted you? Well, Keith Stedman in Football Nightmare by Matt Christopher lives a life-like nightmare. This book is about Keith's life on and off of the football field. Being discouraged by Larry Vincent a kid who wants the starting slot instead of him and encouraged by his family but especially his little sister Traci. Will Keith to play, or will he just try to forget about his whole football past."
2,SOFTBALL,Mr Matthews should stick to his TV program. I can't imagine why my daughter's social studies teacher felt compelled to assign this book. Mind numbingly dull would be the best way to describe it. My 17 yr old was required to read it; I gave up half way through.
5,Chris Mathews Book Hardball,"This book is a must for anyone running for election or for anyone working with a candidate. It is full of practical do's and don'ts..things that are obvious when they are read, but that do not come to most people spontaneously.READ THIS BOOK"
1,Terrible,This guy is a joke. He said he was happy hurricane Sandy hit for political gains. I can not believe they make kids read this in school.
5,'Hardball' is an updated version of 'The Prince',"Whether you want to apply the techniques in this book to business, the bedroom, or the boardroom really doesn't matter. The soundness of them makes them applicable across all of life's battlefields. Like Machiavelli 500 years before him, Mathews reveals through examples like Ronald Reagan, Winston Churchill and John F. Kennedy how to get, keep and wield power."
4,No Bonus Tracks on 2007 Album,"The 2007 version of this great album does not include some 10-16 bonus tracks available on other versions of this album (such as 1998). Many reviewers find the bonus tracks to be equal in quality to the main album. Don't be misled by other comments -- they are commenting on the versions containing bonus tracks. That said, it's still a great album."
1,terrible book,I am taking Java part 1 now. ITs a good thing my teacher knows her stuff. This book is terrible. The arthur seems to forget alot of times that the reader is mostly new to this language. Most the examples are terrible too
3,too dim,this mirror looks great and mounts easily but only comes with a 15 watt bulb and cautions not to use any thing brighter! I added a 60 watt bulb and it's much better but I'm afraid it's going to explode someday.
3,Revlon RV976 lighted wall mounted mirror,Excellent quality.The short fall is the mirror.My wife wished it could have been a little larger to see more area of her face.
2,"Bad movie, but Wendy KICKS ASS!!","You gotta see this movie for Wendy O! Reform School Girls is full of male fantasy, 'caged women', violence, suggested rape, and bad acting. Wendy O Williams steals the show! She is so bad-ass. She's really playing herself instead of the character of Charlie. She did her own stunt in the last scene in one take! If that isn't bad-ass I don't know what is! END"
4,"""Alright ladies....lets play the name game ""","Reform School girls is an over the top woman in prison cult classic that is FUN FUN FUN to watch. I watched this movie 100's of times growing up in the mid 80's, and it still pleases today. Wendy O Williams is completely mesmerizing to watch, although her acting is pretty bad to say the least. Still the film manages to entertain with its completely unbelievable premise. I love this movie. Pat Ast and Wendy O Williams make this movie what it is, and why Sybil Danning got the DVD cover I'll never know (she's barely in the film).Pat and Wendy (both who have since passed) make great villains though, and are thoroughly enjoyable to watch over and over again. If you like low budget, entertaining prison films with lots of women, violence & nudity, then you will love Reform School Girls. The soundtrack is pretty awesome too, and showcases W.O.W's real talent as a musician and performer.CHECK OUT THE DVD COMMENTARY! IT'S PRETTY FUNNY AND ENTERTAINING TO LISTEN TO!"
5,I lost on the 2 nd day of having it,the item came on time and in one piece. This is a awsome P R O D U C T
5,this changed my life,"Jokes, but seriously, if you like having a toothpick handy, but hate the pesky plastic wrapped toothpics, get one of these and set it and forget it."
4,High School Musical Collection,It was great getting these all together. The only disappointing thing was that High School Musical 3 was not the extended version as 1 & 2. Otherwise a great deal!
4,"Great, different music that Furs fans and non-fans will love","I guess I lived in a cave in the 80s because I never heard too much of the Psychedelic Furs, Richard Butler's old band. But when I heard the Love Spit Love songs, ""Change in the Weather"" and ""Am I Wrong,"" I fell in love with Richard Butler, Love Spit Love and the Psychedelic Furs. His voice is so different than any other singer and the music is different and exciting. The lyrics are intriguing. I had the hardest time finding this cd a few years back, and now it's easy to get here. I highly recommend that you give this band a chance. You won't be disappointed!"
3,At Least the CD is Better than the Band's Name,"Four songs are keepers in Love Spit Love. Half a Life and Am I Wrong are first-rate by any standard, filled with ringing vocals and wonderful guitars and hooks that replay in your head for hours. More and Please are a cut below, though still well-worth repeated listenings. The rest of the CD is weak, competently played, but the songs are overblown, postured and just way too aware of being ""art."" Listen carefully before you buy. Simply being a Psychedelic Furs fan will not guarantee your appreciation for LSL."
3,Decent band-more for fans of Love Spit Love,"I enjoyed tracks 4, 8 and 10. One thing I can say with honesty is that Love Spit Love is a fantastic band. They perform well consistently. The singing and music is solid. They have a lot of talent. The rest of the songs on this CD just don't appeal to me. My favorite song by them all time is ""How Soon Is Now."" This track is on the soundtrack for the movie ""The Craft."" That soundtrack is 5 star and so is the movie. Especially for film fans like myself who like sci-fi, horror, and witchcraft. Happy movie watching and music listening!!Norman"
3,bonsai,I was upset because they sent me bamboo plants instead of Bonsai. When I notified Hirt's they wanted me to send a picture of what they sent. I did. It was an inconvenience because I had to borrow a camera to send he picture. They made the mistake and they quesioned my integrity
4,Very accurate,"This is a very helpful dictionary of symbols. Most of the time, I can easily get an interpretation of a dream I had. I highly recommend this book.My only gripe is that sometimes the author says ""this dream is an omen"" or ""this symbol predicts"". I am still not convinced that dreams can tell the future."
2,Provides a strong Christian basis for dream interpretation,"This book was published by Pilgrim Press/The United Church Board for Homeland Ministries. As such, it has a pretty strong Christian slant when interpreting the dream symbols, often quoting Biblical scripture to explain its interpretations.This may make the book ideal for Christian readers, but I found myself disagreeing with many of the book's interpretations as a result of this."
1,"Bad Costumes, Bad Direction, uh...Just Bad all around","Lordy. I remember watching this when I was a kid and then I saw it on TV again a few weeks ago. There were really, really hokey special effects that I could spot when I was a child. There were weird actors. The Meteor/Deep Impact/Armageddon story line make this a depressing visitation to a time when science fiction was still looked at as Sunday pulp. Somehow with all this, this Green Slime gets on one of the Astronauts, and then grows into a bunch of what looks like kids in bad alien costumes with big red eyes. If I can remember properly, this crud was produced and filmed in Japan with American actors, and it was completed quickly to try to beat 2001 to theatres. Cripes, I can still see the poor Japanese children draped in foam rubber with tentacles a danglin, getting shot by weird white dudes. I can't really recommend this for anyone who hasn't seen it when they were a kid."
4,"Good read, good writer, interesting tale.","I wasn't sure what to expect when I read this; I had bought it on the strength of some reviews I read. I wasn't disappointed; Atkinson is a fine writer and the book is very interesting in its plot twists and character interactions. I felt there were perhaps too many characters and a little too much going on, but that's really my only criticism. I felt it was a real page-turner and I read it quickly to find out what was going to happen. After reading this one, I went out and bought several other Atkinson books to read and I am currently reading her short story collection, Not the End of the World. It's also very interesting. It's rare to be a good storyteller AND a good stylist - most writers seem to be one or the other, and Atkinson is definitely both. Give her a try and see what you think."
