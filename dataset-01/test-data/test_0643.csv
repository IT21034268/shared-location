3,Not the most absorbant in the world.,"These could absorb a lot better. They don't really pack much of a punch. Keep trying, 7th Generation."
3,Readable But Not Up to Stark Standards,"This latest Parker novel is entertaining, but the two plots that make up the book are a bit scrawny and the focus of the book wanders just a bit too much from Parker to the less intriguing Larry Lloyd. There is a sense, as the Amazon review notes, that Lloyd wandered in from a Westlake book and stayed around. The result is a rather jarring mix of characters.Parker is still very much himself, thankfully, but even the caper is a bit flat. At times, Parker seems to be a bystander. I wonder if perhaps after reviving Parker and the Stark name, Westlake has again begun to tire of the noir world.Still, you can do a lot worse. This should make fine beach reading."
1,Jams constantly,"Absolute rubbish.Jams constantly.Jams every 3 to 4 days.Has not fixable jams every 2 weeks.Jams in inaccessible parts of the paper path, requiring it to be sent back to the supplier. We use this at work in a vertical market health application and have had to get a second back up printer to use when this is back being repaired during its regular outages. This in in a low intensity application that generates around 150 A4 pages a day. We have tried different paper qualities and sizes with no improvement.We would not use this if we were not contstrained to use it by the stupid vertical market application that we have that ties us to it."
1,worst printer ever made,this printer has the same problem as Lexmark E232 and gives a lot of paper jam.we bought 10 of this printers 4 months ago and only 3 of them are working fine.
3,Only a book of spells.,"This book is only a book and spells. It will not aid beginners in practising Wicca:If a person does not know how to raise and direct power, the most ancient of spells wil be ineffective.If you already practise Wicca please ignore my comments above.The Reviewer from Ohio listed below is unaware of how Wicca works.1. Every Wicca practitioner is a priest or priestess.2. The term High Priest or High Priestess is a meaningless term. The HP or HPS is the person that leads the ceremonies. It in no way means that person is able to direct more power than other members.For beginners wishing to explore Wicca. I would recommend ""Wicca: A Guide for the Solitary Practitioner"" Scott Cunningham.If you have comments or questions; E-Mail me. Two Bears.Wah doh Ogedoda"
1,Uh Uh!,"Better find another way to prosper Silver Ravenwolf, change your name and start over like alot of others do. Or better yet find a new profession because no one is going to believe this that has any common sense about ritual work. This book is another joke put out to make the community look stupid and mythical. Let me assure you that the community of Pagans are alive and very well. We don't need books like this filled with made up nonsense. It doesn't even deserve a one rating."
4,well the spells really didnt appeal to me,"i myself much rather write my own spells, but i must say i did enjoy all the nifty ideas she put in this book to help save you money and banish your debts, its more of a fun book than something to take really seriously, i personally think she is having writers block and i wonder if there is gonna be anymore books in her 2 series, like i said this book is just for fun nothing more"
5,"Simple, elegant, easy to use","This is my second set. I love these, especially for their long handles.The only negative is that the handle broke off on one of the old cups. But I think that was a freak thing since the others were fine."
2,Handle broke off,"With all of the many people, me included, that complain of the handles breaking loose you'd think AMCO would improve their design or quality control. Apparently not."
1,"Handle broke off within a week of using, don't borther","Like many other reviewers have said, the handles on the cups break off with the slightest resistance. I'm not talking about yanking on it or anything, I was cleaning the cups in a normal fashion when the handle came off. I'm very disappointed with these cups and shocked that Cook's Illustrated would recommend them. I will think twice before listening to their advice on equipment in the future."
3,Was great...at first,"When I picked out this bag I was very excited. It had everything I wanted, my husband wouldn't be embarrassed to carry it, and it looked durable. I started using it in October and by November the pocket in the flap had a huge hole in it (I only put keys and my wallet in that area). I also found that it never stayed shut due to the velcro closure on the flap. On the upside the bag had lots of room to store and many different compartments. I still wouldn't recommend it. Instead I have been using the one I got for free from the hospital!"
3,Mediocre Bag,"This bag only lasted about a year for us. While the backpack styling was convenient and easy to carry it just did not hold up very well. The seams started to give out and finally the tie closure part just ripped away from the bag. We did not carry very much stuff in it either. We liked the way it looked, especially my husband, but the quality was just not there."
4,Fun for Grad Party,"I graduated in 2001 and the 2001 graduation CD hadn't come out yet, so I bought this one (I later bought the 2nd one, too).My one complaint with this CD is that the artists covering these sounds don't sound like the original artist. In most cases they did a good job. Mambo #5 was really bad, but Freshman sounds better than the original artist."
4,A good art book,I have purchased many of the How to draw manga books and a few from other how to art books. This one includes many useful costumes to add to your characters wardrob. The content of this book is in color to help the artist make color illustrations. Like many how to books it does not tell you how to do every detail step by step. It is like many from this series that expects you to have some artistic skill before you picked up this book. Intended for intermediate to advanced artists but could be usefull to new artists as practice material. You will get better with practice and there is good content in this book to help you improve.
1,very disappointing,"My 4-year-old son and I really love the ""original"" Magic School Bus books by Cole & Degan. They are all great books which introduce science concepts in a way kids can grasp. The Scholastic knock-offs from the TV show seem to be very variable in quality - some are good and some fail. As a series they all lack the depth of information which is the hallmark of the Cole & Degan books.This is one of the worst from the Scholastic series. I realize that they are just making books directly from the TV series scripts, but the writing in this one is poor. It doesn't flow well and had a ""fingernails on a blackboard"" quality for me."
4,"Buy, sell, travel and make a fortune!","I bought this game for my [...] year old boy. He liked it a lot more than I expected. He made a fortune selling and buying spices, tea, wine etc... and best of all he got to destroy pirates ships by building his own powerful armada. So why 4 stars and not 5? I just think the graphics could be improved. Other than that: it's a great game."
3,"Was excited about getting this CD, until I did...","I was bummed with this CD. I was expecting the orginal artist to perform the songs, e.g., Thriller - Michael Jackson, etc. Actually, it's not the original artist, but someone who they tried to make it sound like the orginal artist."
4,Perfect for on the go reading,"I bought this book when on a cross-country jaunt last year before leaving Seattle. I had finished the books I'd brought with me and now just wanted some short, light-hearted stories about other travelers and their misadventures. I agree with other reviewers in that you don't really want to read these stories all the time, as they get old quickly. However, for times when you just want something to engross you for a while when you're one the road and leave you with some chuckles, it's a good buy. I enjoyed this book thoroughly and look forward to contributing my own misadventures someday. Don't get it if you're expecting some life-changing views on other cultures or travel in general, but get ready to laugh a bit and pass your time with this book in a pleasant way."
4,"Great read, good laughs.","I stumbled upon this book in our local ""Booksmart"" bookstore. The first story I browsed was entitled ""The Big O"". I laughed so loud that the owner of the bookstore came to see what was up. I couldn't stop laughing. There are many funny stories, some less funny than others. Overall a great book. Great travel stories, from places I never even heard. Each story is original and well told. A great read, good laughs."
1,Not good,I really like the sugarfree red vines and love the red scotty dogs. Bought 5# of this and nobody in my family will eat them. They are chewy but very little flavor. Thought I could save a few bucks but this one was a mistake...
2,FLAT TASTING,"They have a flat taste to them,Vines are much better,Won't buy then again, Won't suggest the to any body I know eho uses sugar free candy"
3,Not a lot of flavor,"Came relatively quickly in a gigantic plastic bag that closed with a twist-tie. It didn't have a lot of flavor but was OK in general. I doubt if I'd buy it again because it was fairly expensive and I was expecting something a little tastier. It was fresh and not stale at all. So, overall, it was fair, I'd say. Not outstanding, but not horrible either."
4,lady who never became a victim,marie never let any man make a victim out her.the prince of wale was a spoiled brat who fell more in love with her than she in him.she survived 2 husband befor prince of wales lost heart to her.she made sure she got a wedding ring own her finger even with her marriage to the prince being illegal in the eyes of the crown.in the end her place in prince life change she made sure her and her childern recieve money to live comfortable lives from the crown.
3,Squeaker in tail didn't last a week,The Rat Dog squeaker in the tail didn't last a week. The sound within the body of the toy works fine but my 70 pound dog prefers toys that he can get into his mouth. This toy is much too large for him to grab unto so next time I will get a smaller toy.
4,Incredibly sexy boot but needs insoles,"I've never thought that anything with a 4 inch heel on it would be comfortable, so I wasn't disappointed with these boots. They are ""dead sexy"" (in the words of my boyfriend) and not unreasonably uncomfortable if you add a gel insole. I don't care that they aren't real suede, they still look hot. And besides, the stretch in the fabric helps make them more comfortable. I wouldn't wear them dancing or out sightseeing or anything, but for a dinner date or even for work, these boots are fab."
3,Good idea.,"This item is light and great for travel plans with toddlers. I gave it 3 stars because the mattress does not self inflate and did not even work with a manual or electrical pump. I took a little mattress so my baby would be comfy, if not he would be sleeping on the floor with the mattress that came with this product."
3,Linnen cabinet,"This cabinet was somewhat challenging to assemble (took about 4 hours), but is as described. It's good quality, but not top quality, which you wouldn't expect for the price. It was the perfect size to store linnens in our little bathroom, and looks good there."
5,Robert Turner: Clay Supreme,"The book is excellent, especially for a potter like I strive to become. It is a beautiful book full of beautiful objects and pictures of Turner and his surroundings."
1,"DISKETTE MEANS 3.5"" FLOPPY DISK!","Don't waste your money unless you just want the book! Their ""diskette"" is obsolete! Even when I did find a computer with a 3.5"" disc drive, I couldn't open many of the outdated Windows files even in compatibility mode with Windows 7. I copied the usable files to my thumb drive but most of the files I wanted were unusable."
1,Way OUTDATED,"This publication is way out of current conditions. It contains a ""diskett"" if that gives you any idea. (1999)"
3,Homemade pizza dough recipe lacking accurate flour measure.,"The cookbook overall is filled with mouth-watering recipes and easy to follow directions and layout.Major disappointment came, however, in the homemade pizza dough recipe (page 141)... Seems to be a ""typo"" in the flour quantity. The recipe requires one cup of flour, but with 2/3 cup warm water doesn't seem to be accurate. When preparing this recipe I had to trial-and-error the quantity of flour myself.This recipe was very important to me, for pizzas, but also for bread when shaped into a short loaf, the one I tried to prepare first, and one which didn't quite turn out, hence my disappointment.The apple chutney, on the other hand, was quite a success."
2,Too complicated for the mid-level cook.,"While the pictures are pretty, anyone who's cooking experience is less than chef level will find these recipes a bit ridiculous. If you like the food, go to the restaurant. The incredibly loud atmosphere will be less of an annoyance if you must have this overrated, lackluster and overpriced food."
2,A very interesting book; it's a pity it's badly written and there are so many inaccuracies,"This was a compulsively readable book of death trivia, well-illustrated, with numerous interesting tales of people who died in unusual ways. I noticed several inaccuracies, however, and some sentences that were so grammatically flawed they made me wince. There are better books of death trivia out there; I recommendThis Will Kill You: A Guide to the Ways in Which We GoandCause of Death: A Perfect Little Guide to What Kills Us. For some tangential death-related trivia,After the Funeral: The Posthumous Adventures of Famous CorpsesandExtreme Encounters: How It Feels to Be Drowned in Quicksand, Shredded by Piranhas, Swept Up in a Tornado, and Dozens of Other Unpleasant Experiencesare both awesome."
4,another gift from blizzard,"like diablo2 exclusive gift set which came out 2 years ago, it's also a gift set, including: one cdrom of warcraft3, an official strategy guide, a beautiful?? cinematic dvd and warcraft2 battle.net edition. (now nobody wants to play it on bnet tho..) well, it's really a nice gift cuz warcraft3 is pretty great, so, buy it for either yourself or ur children, DON'T MISS IT!! but if u ALREADY have any of the other 2 editions, SAVE THE MONEY!"
2,2 stars,"Although the main characters were somewhat likable, I just couldn't finish this book. As other reviewers mentioned, there were horrible formatting issues that bothered me. But my main reason for disliking the book is that the author used way too many of the possible suspense-producing plot lines found in historical romances. 1) Hero making bet with good friend about winning the hand of the heroine--check. 2) Father bribing hero to marry heroine--check. 3) Runaway carriage--check. And then I stopped reading. I'm glad it was free, but still won't waste any more of my time reading it."
4,1 of 2days male underated vocalist,"OMG Man I love music, this kid here who jsut turned 20..Is touched by GOD his voice... Someone earlier mention Lfye Jennings inthe making nahhh..Lyfe has an anoying voice, and songs wasnt allthat..This lil kat here he gives you5 worth songs to listen to..And last but not least Im so glad they put ""WHERE WERE YOU"" on this album, cause that song needs 2 be listend to , it makes me think back in my younger days although im 23.....I ve lost friends since some of the things he mention, and many other close peeps to me...."
3,Dropped toy and sound stopped,The toy was great when it worked correctly! The games on the toy are fun. The small round size is more difficult to use than the longer pill shaped version. We dropped the toy once and then the sound stopped. My son doesn't enjoy the game without sound.
4,Great Tear jerker,Here is a family movie that will keep you is suspense and on a emotional roller coaster ride. This is not your run of the mill standard lay out for a movie. We have a Have a husband and wife that want a child and end up with one then they lose him because of the government then the get him back and loose him again then the twist of an ending. Will bring tears to your eyes. Like I said a family movie. Can't find too many of those these days.
5,one bright actor,"Oliver Barret is the same actor that played in Neverending Story and did a great job in that movie. He is already grown up, but he'll be my buddy for life. I like how natural Oiver Barret was in this movie. He played the part of a boy who had a ""brain chip"" implant, this gave him extraordinary abilities. He was eventually reclaimed by the government taken from his adopted family. Even though some of the technology is outdated like seeing an old-fashioned Atari computer the movie is still fun to see. I hope a DVD version comes out. I dearly love this movie to pieces, but I want a DVD copy for myself.If I had any kids I would definitely allow them to see this one entertaining movie. You're the best Oliver Barret. THANK YOU"
3,"Funny, but a little crude.","This book is very funny if you don't mind reading for 5 minutes about a boy who needs to pee. My son thinks it's hilarious, but then he's 12 and a little crude sometimes himself. I don't read it to my preschool class, because it does not convey an attitude that I want them to have. Also, some parents might find it a little offensive. All in all, it is funny but not for a group."
3,"Colors very light or too dark, but good overall value","Well made, but colors were a bit dissapointing. The garnet is almost black. Still a good value for the money."
5,beautiful,Loved these earrings. The stones were larger than I expected and very clear. The amethyst is a little pale but still a lovely color.
2,nope,"Did not like I returned them, beware look pretty but, not at all, watch out, delelivery was okay but nothing else."
4,"Cheap, but that's my little secret!!!","I got these as a lightning deal to round out my personal jewelry collection. I wasn't sure what to expect at this price point, but when the sets arrived I was pleasnatly surprised. These are much better quality that what you would normally find for this price.The stones shine brilliantly with an impressive size and weight. The color and clarity of the stones are also impressive. The only shortcoming are the garnets - they look more like a dull brown than the rich, deep red pictured and sparkle noticeably less than the others. I probably won;t wear the garnets too often for that reason. That being said, I still feel that my money was well spent.I bought the matching pendant collection as well, but honestly the earrings look just as beautiful worn alone or with a second set of earrings (I like them worn with sterling silver hoops)."
3,Too heavy on the ear,"I agree that these are a great bargain, and the stones are all beautiful. The only problem is that they flop over on the earlobe because they are so heavy. They also are set very high, so from the side you mainly see the silver setting. I bought these for my sister, and she didn't end up keeping them because they sagged downward on her ear lobe. I tried them on and they worked ok for me. I guess one just needs to have thick and short earlobes to make these heavy earrings sit properly on the ear."
2,Almost unwearable,"I saw these and immediately saw what a great deal they were for the price for authentic gemstones. However, when my wife wore them we both realized that the combination of the large stones with the high setting pushes the earring so far from the ear that it droops. At this point we're considering making them into so other piece of jewelry since they're not really useful as earrings. Too bad since they were such a great idea."
5,Gem Earrings,Excellent quality earrings. Very nicely detailed and gems are bright and precisely cut.
4,Nice!,"These are just the ticket if you need attractive small earrings for daily wear. I was pleased with the look, quality, and value and variety of colors and different shapes. They fit comfortably and also fit the bill for an attractive small stud earring. LH"
1,Do Not Buy!,"I have used this product on my dog for years and it always worked miracles. However, after I started using this particular bottle I noticed that my dog became extremely itchy. After a trip to the vet I learned that this shampoo was the culprit to an allergic reaction and the cause of hair loss on all 4 of his paws. His poor little tail was so swollen from biting at it and he was even losing hair under his face from scratching. Once I stopped this product the issues went away. Again, I never had any issues with this product in the past and I wonder if I really bough Malaseb or was it something else?!"
5,Great book on using win32 API in windows CE OS,"Note that he doesn't claim to cover GUI programming. It is great in its explanation of thread synchronization, accessing drivers, and differences between CE and desktop Windows."
4,"Not well made, but did the job.","My son wanted lots of ninja weapons for his Halloween costume, and was thrilled with this set. He didn't mind that the sword came apart rather easily, and I didn't mind when the stars started disappearing as he lost them."
5,Fantastic book. This is how to change your life. The answer!,"Do you want energy and better quality of life? read this book! No more starvation diets that set you up to fail, no more counting calories and more food than you ever thought possible. Did you know you can loose waight by eating at least 2000 calories????"
4,Excellent but expensive,"This product is excellent to prevent dry skin. Use it after, but while you're still in the shower.There are generic products available from all the major drug stores, but none have as pleasant a scent. The generic always seem to have a hint of rancid vegetable oil."
5,Dry Skin Relief,"I am so glad to find Alpha Keri bath oil on Amazon, and I found a ""two-pack"" that is even more reasonable since first ordering this. It is hard to find this in stores. Great for Montana winters; leave on instead of rinsing for especially dry skin. Light scent and does not feel greasy after shower/bath."
5,David Klass is a great author and this book was excellent.,"Even if you don't enjoy basketball, this book should be read by any teen. It provides great moral standards and i couldn't put the book down. It was definetly an all-time favorite of mine:)"
4,A Fun Book To Read,"It's about a boy name Jim who plays basketball in Minnesota. He has special powers that help him make shots. Some people came and asked him something about him. I recommend this book to anybody because it's easy to read, and the author writes like the character is thinking. It's not boring, if you like basketball."
3,Danger Zone Review,"In the book Danger Zone, there is alot of Racism because of the members on Jimmy Doyle's USA Basketball team. It was well written by David Klass with all the different dialouge in it. There is alot of things that people don't like in this book. The players got over everything and played well. This is a good book for Young Adults to read."
2,"You Need It, But It's A Pain...","Let me just say that not only is this figure unattractive -- even as monsters go -- but it refuses to cooperate with the little stand post it comes with. I have lost count of how many times it's fallen off my shelf! For some reason, the figure is misproportioned and provides hours of frustration as you try to position it. Yeah, you need it for your collection....but still..."
2,Boring,"I don't mind it's in black and white. What gets me is the lack of enthusiasm. With exception of the drummer, the band seems like they're just going through the motions. Lemmy can keep this one."
4,Tools required for assembly.,"Seriously, I'm not joking. Bring Pliers.The box is great. It comes in 3 pieces, the box itself, the divider and the lid. And for some silly reason they were all stapled together. So after digging around for a pair of needle nose pliers, I was able to separate them and assemble the box. It's sturdy and holds cards as advertised. So aside from the strange stapling issue it's everything you would expect from a piece of cardboard."
1,Worst packing I have ever seen,"This was the worst packaging i have ever seen. Item arrived unassmbled so it was a flat piece of cardboard but it was just loosely wrapped in plastic wrap and tape. Im serious it was like they took plastic wrap from the kitchen, wrapped the flat box a couple times and stuck some tape on it. My second favortie part was the 20+ stamps! They put an old 37 cent stamp on it and then went to town with 2 cent stamps. it arrived bent and unusable but hey at least I got a miniature stamp collection out of the deal, wasn't even worth my time returning."
3,Not as good as the unabridged version,"For adults, not as good as the unabridged Martyrs Mirror, however it would be a fine book for any youth."
3,Suave but lackadaisical readings of saucy pieces,"David Hurwitz thinks that ""boeuf"" means cow and that Milhaud relished the ""sites and sounds"" of Brazil? Oh well. Kent Nagano has paired Milhaud's two most famous pieces--and almost the only ones that survive from this overly prolific composer, who looked like a dapper French Buddha.Devoted as Nagano has been to the Gallic cause, he misfires in both works. ""La Creation"" is far too careful, and not nearly jazzy enough. ""Boeuf"" starts off in the right lively vein, but we quickly leave Rio behind and find ourselves in a stuffy ocncert hall. The charming but negligible Harp Concerto also gets a sweet, rather bland reading, but that's in the nature of the piece. (Anyone seeking a lively Boeuf sur le Toit should look to violinist Arnaud Capucon's quirky re-mix with rising conductor Daniel Harding.)"
4,Frighteningly exciting.,CCCOOOOOOLLLLL!!!!!!!!!! I would definitely reccomend this book to anyone who likes Goosebumps.
5,Yard lights controller,"After checking the internet for a remote controlled controller for our yard lighting, I was pleased to find the HW 21090 Heavy Duty Remote Control, now we can turn the lights on or off as we wish, rather then having to rely on an automatic timer which more often then not is out of wack.."
2,Defective,"I wanted to use this for an outdoor fountain. Remote was supposed to work from 150 feet, but it only worked from 10 ft away! I will be returning it."
2,Do Not use for motors,"I just bought the HW2190 Heavy Duty Remote Control for my Dust Control System and it burned up only after 4 uses. It said ""Heavy Duty"" and I assumed it would work to turn on the Vacuum. I can hear it clicking on and off, but no power and no reset. I'm very disappointed."
3,Remote Control,"This is a good item. I purchased 2 units and this applies to both items. They are well made, nothing cheap about them. It can be remotely turned ""On"" from a long distance. Inside my house it will work about 60 ft through 3 walls. Outside up to 110 ft. The problem is turning it ""Off"" with the remore controller. Standing 15 feet from the unit with one wall in between it is difficult to get the units to respond to the ""Off"" button. I have to press the ""Off"" button 3-4 times and then I am still not sure that the unit turned off. It is the best ""remote control"" I have found, just not Great."
2,O.K. Book (from 13 y.o. bookworm),"I thought this was an O.K. book. It took a LONG time to get going, though. I felt that this book never had a real plot. It got sort of boring. This book is about a girl that really wants adventure,(she's the daughter of a very wealthy family in Venice) so, she sneaks out one day and meets this guy. She's disguised as a boy this whole time. She keeps sneaking out to the 'poor' or normal place in town until her parents catch her. A bunch of other stuff happens too. I thought it was an alright book. Defidentily not on my favorites list, though. I wouldn't want to read it again."
2,"Argh, why the five point harness?","If your baby is one of those well behaved ones that don't squirm as you try to position him/her into place, you may want to consider this swing. My two star rating is due to the simple fact that the safety belts are infuriatingly diffult to clasp, especially if the baby is resisting your effots. We've tried to use this twice. Exasperated, we gave it away."
3,Not the best in the series,"Although the desciptions and details of this Civil War mystery were very interesting and obviously well-researched, the plot was not as tight as previous Tonneman books. While character development was fair, not great, the very short chapters seemed to jump from place to place in the city - a little helter skelter. Overall I would recommend this book, but again, the earlier ones are better."
2,Too big!,"I got this diaper bag before my 6 month old son was born and have used it less than 10 times. It is simply too big and the material is too stiff. I would prefer a backpack that is soft-sided so that it fits easily in the stroller basket or in the car when space is tight. I've been using my free Enfamil bag forever, but I need to find something else!"
5,BUY THIS BAG,"My husband registered for this backpack so he'd have something ""manly"" to carry while toting our son around town. It's been hanging in the closet ever since the shower because we've just been using my bag (which I now realize is completely inferior).I pulled out this backpack last week because I was taking our son for a weeklong trip to visit with family who live out of town. Oh my gosh -- this bag is so awesome! I couldn't believe how much I was able to fit in it. There's room for everything (except big, bulky blankets). I was able to pack all of his clothes and socks, bath supplies, burp cloths, and bibs. It really helped lighten my load.Another plus is the fact that I can carry it as a backpack, freeing up my hands and arms to tend to my son. It's not easy carrying your child around when you've got a bag on your shoulder that keeps slipping off!Make sure to check out this bag. It's been a lifesaver for me!"
1,Not impressed,"I ordered this bag online before I had my daughter. I've probably only used it a handful of times & when I did it was very inconvenient! It's so confining, everything was so difficult to access!"
5,STEPPING UP!,"I've been wearing Birks since 1999 and I absolutely love them. They are very well made, suit the contours of my feet and I have high arches and are so extremely comfortable for the wide foot as well. Whether with or without socks, they are a great fit. They last a long time and tolerate any kind of weather conditions. Slip out the insert and you could walk through water with them. Love them and look forward to staying in them for years to come."
3,Birki's clog,"Great color and fit, but if youre going to be ON YOUR FEET all day, I dont recommend these. Theyre not as comfortable as I had hoped. My feet ache at the end of the day :("
3,comfortable,"These shoes are comfortable to wear for long periods of time, especially standing. The only draw back is the ventilation. They really don't breath and cause stinky feet."
4,"Good, but could have been better, I think.","Having studied the Tao, I enjoyed the book, but felt the aspects of the Tao could have been covered better. I had the feeling the Author was rushed & ""winging it."" Still, 4 stars."
4,Good Product,"Let me start by saying this is better than Apple TV...While Apple Tv is easy to use, it just doesn't do very much. The EVA8000 is easy to use and has alot to offer. I use it to display photos and digital movies and it works great. The ineternet radio function is very cool but if you want to add a station it is not as easy as they make it seem. At least, they give you a bunch of pre loaded options.Negatives would be a bit pricey and better intergration with my PC."
3,Works alright,"This device works as described, and has a lot of power but the interface for setup and operation modes is somewhat limited. The web interface is nice to have, but it is not nearly powerful enough to make up for the onscreen interface problems. The machine occasionally fails to respond to the remote, and had difficulty catalogging some items. Rebuilding the library by rescanning the media storage locations solved that problem."
3,Sweet and sour,"I am using the unit wireless and a lot of my problems would probably be resolved with a network cable but with me that is not an option. Pictures work fine and a lot of video files look great until I lose my connection and have to start over. The view of the desktop from the TV is poor but again this could be my connection. In fairness with Netgear I am still learning, and some of these problems may be resolved with a call to the company. I like it more than dislike the unit, but there is plenty of room for improvement."
1,Starts okay but then....,"The book started out fine. I liked the first half - then it was boring, badly written, and way too self indulgent. I too bought it based on the comments on the front and back cover and thought a NY Times book reviewer probably knew what a good book was. The last half needed to be much shorter - somewhat of a clever idea but didn't quite work in reality."
2,What a waste of my subway commutes....,"I couldn't bring myself to finish the last 30 pages. I did try, really. But it's empty drivel that I find unremarkable in so many ways. The only reason he could even get a book published is the fact that he was a book reviewer for some big papers. No wonder the New York Times Book Review gave it a rave review....the punk worked for them and must not have burned any bridges on his way OUT. I SUM IT UP AS BEING 220 PAGES TOO LONG. I still feel cheated spending $...for the paperback at The Strand!!"
2,Not great,"I wasn't very impressed with this bottle drying rack. Not many things fit on this giant item. Things slide off because of the sloped surface. And it isn't very organized. You just dump the stuff in a pile. It looks very messy to me. There is only room for 6 bottles. I'm a breastfeeding Mom, but I use it to dry my pump collection bottles as well and there is just no room for everything. The only reason I didn't rate this 1 star is because the rack is sturdy."
5,"Reminiscent of other top female indie-folk, but unique enough to be completely her own style","Beautifully executed album will make you remember why it used to be worth buying an entire album for $12-16, because every song was good AND different - though cohesive and thematic. Sound and lyrics are rich and full of 'heart'. A recent lucky find. Thanks Pandora."
5,One of the best albums of the year.,I have purchased a large number of albums and this is the only review I have ever posted on Amazon. It is very rare to find a CD that every song is great. I honestly had this CD in my car for a week straight and never got tired of it. In fact the more I heard the songs the more I feel in love with them. I wish more people would buy this album and hear for themselves one of the best albums to be released this year.
3,Nice to Have,"I use this bracelet when I am going out so if I lose track of time or forget what side I nursed on last, I can just look at the bracelet. I've noticed that this bracelet is a great conversation starter - a lot of people ask ""What's that bracelet for?""My only complaint is it's a little too big for my wrist and will sometimes turn itself inside out. So, now I just move the bracelet from wrist to wrist."
4,"Great idea, but the clips keep breaking.","My wife is using this with our second child. This is a great idea, but the clips keep breaking. They probably should have been made of metal."
5,Great Resource!,"This book is an excellent resource for studying period fashion. Unlike so many period fashion books, which focus on evening wear or the clothing of the wealthy, this book gives great examples of what the general population wore every day. It will be extremely useful to costumers and fashion students."
1,poorly written and uninformative,"Canyon Adams is not an author. He shouldn't write books and then contrive a bunch of good reviews to try and make it sell. This book misses every mark and standard for a serious expose of our president. I challenge anyone who buys this book to write their review here, and then Mr. Adams might be hard pressed to keep up writing phony reviews to keep his average star rating above one star. Actually I hope not that many people were fooled into buying this book."
5,Great Christmas Devotion!,"This series of books is a favorite for our family. The stories are exciting as well as biblically sound. We have been reading Jotham's Journey and Tabitha's Travels during Advent for several years now. This year we were unable to do it and the kids, ages 16 and 13, said Christmas was just not the same without it! We're looking forward to reading this in Christmas 2010."
3,Not for desktops...,"This is a great tool, but it won't fit in any of the five desktop computers I've tried it in. It places a lot of bulk right around the USB port, so it really only works for a laptop. It's a great product, but don't buy it to use with a desktop."
4,Evolution,"This is one of the best swing CDs I've purchased. First heard one of his tunes on the album Jive's Alive and loved it, searched out this album, and haven't looked back. Its swing; heart and sould and beat, but with 'attitude'. A definite change from the mainstream swing and well worth a listen."
1,WARNING--CULT MATERIAL,This book is written by a well known mind control cult with child abuse scandals. Research before you get involved![..]
5,A Boy and His Tiger,"""Yukon Ho!"" is a collection of daily and Sunday ""Calvin and Hobbes"" comic strips. Since the dates have not been left in the strips, it is difficult to determine the time frame involved. But that doesn't really matter, because this strip is as fresh and funny today, years after Bill Watterson ended the strip, as it was back in the day.If you have never heard of Calvin and his adventures with his stuffed tiger, Hobbes, pick this book up today and become hooked with the rest of us."
4,New Mom,I really like this bag because of the design. My only disappointment was that it was NAVY BLUE and I wanted a black diaper bag.
4,In love with this bag!!!,"My husband calls me a ""diaper bag addict!"" This is like my 5th one and I can say I'm in love with this one! It's small and very fashion. Although on the inside it's a little bit small to put my daughter's cloth in (leave a 2nd bag for extra clothes in the car!), the extra side pockets will help and for the price, what more can you ask for?"
1,Instant waste of money,I purchased Instant Architect because it was cheap & boy did I get what I paid for. It doesn't do any kind of 3d views & it's very difficult to use. Unless you want to spend many many hours trying to learn this software I would suggest you save your money & buy something better.
5,I read it...... and was there again.,"I was the Platoon right guide and assisted Langone in hurding the guys into the swamp. I was thinking that they were fooling around with the ""Help me! "" routine. But it was for real, Guys were going down. Mr. Stevens did his homework and produced and admirable piece of work. I look foward to some sort of follow-up on what the rest of the guys are doing. Some say it was our platoon that slightly changed the way the Corps operates at that entry level, but I would like to believe that nothing changed because that is the way it worked before we came along. Mac was just unfortunate that this happened and got out to the press of the 1950's south. Not a very nice place at the time, as I can recall."
1,Don't be fooled!,"They look very nice in the pictures. I bought the necklace and the matching earrings. But when I received the real things, they look so crappie. The necklace is only 14"" long. The metal parts and chain have sharp edges all over the places. The ""Black-Diamond Crystal"" are actually cheap plastic beads with big molding offset edges. The service from the seller is even worse. I complained about the length and the quality of the item and want to have them returned for refund. The seller asked me to have them shipped back at my cost. I paid for shipping and have the item returned the next day but only got 60% of my money back. Don't be fooled!"
4,Great for beginners,I have another older one and seen this one on a youtube vid and thought it was cute and got it. It's lighter than my old one but sounds just as good. The book is helpful but could use a couple more songs. As a novelty gift I loved the fact that it resembles a tall one lol.
5,EXCELLENT!,"Wow, the best diaper bag we've had!1. Excellent, versatile color!2. Washable material that keeps it's shape and doesn't fade!3. Can look, 'Manly' and 'Feminine' depending on who carries it!4. All the perfect pockets for everything at your fingertips!5. Our friends like it so much, they've bought matching Colorado totes and backpacks!!Can't go wrong with this one, it's one of our favourite baby items! :)"
5,THREE Years and still going great!,"I've had this bag for three years and it is still in great condition. I swear it never gets dirty! My friends are amazed at how old the bag is yet it still looks new. The color of the bag camouflages the dirt. It's a very well-made bag. I'm always abusing this bag, but it never get damaged or worn out. It has tons of pockets and I use every single one of them. It has places to hold bottle, cups, diapers, personal items, etc. The big outside pocket is great for throwing last-minute items into the bag. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this bag!"
1,Looks Roomier Than Actually Is,"I know that we're in the minority, but my husband and I don't find this bag roomy in the slightest. If you put anything at all in the inside pockets, there is no 'middle' left to speak of! We'd like to be able to carry a lightweight blanket with us most places we go and if we do, the bag is bulging with just the few items we put inside: bottle, formula holder, diapers, flat wipes dispenser and an extra set of clothes. Forget trying to actually fit any toys inside the bag. We've just accepted them spilling over and hardly ever zip the top. We're actually considering purchasing another bag for travel and using this one for quick trips to the grocery, etc. It doesn't help that the bag is black inside making locating anything a challenge. Overall assessment: Disappointed."
5,"Excellent storyline, very engaging","It's very entertaining story, and has funny verbal banter between characters. It is not a slapstick comedy, so expect to be all ears when you watch it, or you will miss out on the best dialogs."
2,More irritating than funny,"I've only watched the first 3 in the first of the series and I'm hoping it picks up at some point. The gal who plays his secretary is absolutely obnoxious.....she's really over the top--rude and doesn't care a fig about doing a good job....I can't even enjoy her. I find the people in town also extremely rude. The only person I like (other than the dr, who I like a lot and wonder why he doesn't just leave and go someplace where people at least use their brains) is the man who has throat cancer. He at least has some substance."
5,doc martin,i love this program on iptv.so i looked on amazon and seen they have the series.i bought the 1st. series and intend to purchase the rest of them later. they were very well priced.it came in a box and was packed in bubble.i was very pleased.will refer to others.
5,Review of Doc Martin,"I discovered the Mini series about 5 months ago and i cant get enought. It was showing on a public station where i live for a short time but stopped. I was so excited that i could order season one on Amazon.com and im really looking forward to Season 2 coming July 30th. I have told my friends, family and Co-workers that have to see it. Doc Martin is a Top doctor in London when all of sudden he starts to have Panic attacks when he sees blood."
5,One of the funniest anti-social characters ever created!,"He is socially inept, but wonderfully human! Doc Martin is a very funny series with a master actor in charge of the difficult task of making this seemingly unfeeling, insensitive, poor-bedside-mannered, blood-fearing physician come across a an endearing and (sometimes sympathetic) loveable human being who truly shows that perserverance and a bit of prodding from family and friends can lead to happiness and love...with a great deal of humor along the way! A special kudos to the wonderful Stephanie Cole who is absolutley wonderful as Martin's aunt, Joan!"
2,Not compatiable with the world of wireless web and phones,"I was really excited about the concept... I like to listen to internet radio, but get stuck in my computer room/office. So I bought these at a local retailer, boy was I disappointed. The product was reasonably priced and included everythign (remote, wireless receiver and sender,etc). A good value for all you get. But everything in my home interfered with the sound. The 2.4GHZ range is alot more crowded these days...and I could not get a clear signal from even 10 feet away. I am going back to good old cabling to send the audio feed from my computer to my hi-fi system."
2,Poor sound quality,"Low expectations key to avoiding disappointement. At least in an appartment building where the neighbors employ a variety of electronic devices the sound quality was poor, the songs sounded like they were coming from a dusty sratched up record spinning on a turntable. Changing channels (there are four) didn't help. Oh, and there were some minor problems too: couldn't get the remote to work, one cable was missing from the package while another came with a duplicate, only two batteries were included instead of four. Had to return the product. Maybe someone else with more patience and better luck will be able to get satisfactory performance out of this thing."
4,The Best film of Afterdark III,"This one was easily the best movie of this year's entries. It had solid acting, story and a cool twist ending. Definitely check this one out."
3,Not as good as Combat Mission series,"Combat Mission Afrika Korps is a much older--and better--game. If you need to own every decent wargame ever published and can find it for $20 or less, than it's a good buy. Compared to the CM Series, this game and the previous one is a bit clunky and buggy.What does set it apart from CM is that you can go into the text files and pretty much change any weapon system right down to the caliber, range and hitting power of a tank's 2nd machine gun. So if you enjoy that sort of thing, you'll ignore the game's other weaknesses."
3,Too pricey,"They r out of their minds. The costs of these 'toys' no longer makes it a toy but a collectors item for adult big boys. They are made for 5.00 over seas and marked 3,000 percent to take advantage of us Americans. Not a good buy. BEsides they put it together once and after a week 300.00 is wasted put it toward ur kids education or take them to Disney. or buy them the We2"
4,Nice but expensive.,"My 6 year old likes it but one of the first things he said, when it was finished, is that he thought it would be bigger. We have built other Lego items that had as many pieces but cost less than half the price. For the price, I would recommend buying a premade castle and formed characters - it would be bigger, stronger and more realistic"
3,Overpriced and too big,This small Spanish guide doesn't have much information for the price AND it is too big to easily fit into a pocket or purse.
2,Disappointed,"I have read every book Ann Rule has written and she is one of the greatest crime writers of all. This book doen't cut it. Although I know truth can be stranger than fiction, this fiction is not believable."
4,Part of a good series,"I'm surprised to find that this book is out of print. If you can track down the books of this series, I definitely recommend buying them. Each book is written by a different author, but there is good consistency among them. I'm normally a science fiction fan, and this series provides a great combination of science fiction, aliens, time travel, historical themes, and even throws in a bit of Dante's Inferno. Definitely worth the time to read."
3,quality nice but too pricey,Product quality was good but item was not as pictured (One not three items per price listed). No warning in description of fewer sold than shown. Felt cheated. Too expensive for just one. Okay price if were two or more. Company return policy not to my liking.
3,Nice!,I bought this for my daughter for Christmas. A light fragrance. She liked it and so did I. I plan on getting more very soon.
1,completely ruined the book,"I thought this movie was gonna be one of the best i'd ever see......boy was I WRONG!!!!I CAN NOT believe that Jodi Picoult allowed these people to ruin a good novel like this. 1) They left out one of the best characters in the book; Campbell Alexander's ex-girlfriend/girlfriend, Julia Romano and most disapointing 2) They completely reversed the ending...it was Anna that was supposed to die...NOT Kate!!! Anna dying was one of the unexpected scenes in the book that made the novel's originality!!! I thought it was SO ""gag-me"" and ""sappy"" when Kate died after she talked to her mom about ""letter her go."" I thought that was a joke!!! And they left out some of Campbell's best excuses for his dog, Judge.I HIGHLY, STRONGLY recommend reading the book if you haven't already...and just forget the movie!!! My only praise is that the actors did a really good job...but the producers RUINED the original storyline!!!"
5,Better than the book!,"Not too often that I say a movie is better than the book, but this is one of those cases. I was very disappointed in the way the ending of the book was handled. The movie did what the book should have. Next time I read the book, I think I'll stop at the end and just watch the movie's ending to finish it off."
2,Boo hiss!,"I am amazed at how much this film managed to be worse than the book. Most of the acting is terrible...in fact, I think the best performance is given by the canine who played Judge the service dog. The film totally deviates from the plot of the book, which focuses more on Anna's quest to obtain medical emancipation from her parents. However, the movie is much more about Kate's struggle with leukemia. Many of the things that occur in the film have nothing to do with the book, and the ending is completely rewritten from the novel for reasons that I will never understand. Bottom line? This movie pretty much sucks. I have lost two hours of my life that I will never get back!"
3,Good but not true to the book. SPOILERS!!!!!!!!!!,"This was a good movie and I enjoyed it very much. The problem is that they didn't stay true to the twist at the end of the book. The acting was good, the writing was good except for the end. If you didn't read the book you will love this movie and not scratch your head at the end when the wrong sister dies."
2,Why Did They Change They Ending?,"I was enjoying this movie -- until I got to the ending. In the book, the ending was a stunner: surprising and very thought-provoking. I have no idea why they decided to alter the ending which, in my opinion, totally ruined the movie. Do yourself a favor and read the book instead."
3,My Sister's Keeper,"The movie was ok. It was a little hard to know if the scenes were in the past or present because it switched back and forth so much. It was a little sad. The mom was really mean. I was watching it with my 14 year old and don't like sex scenes and even though it was a PG-13 you can't trust them. I was not sure what was coming when they left the dance but they didn't really show anything but you just knew and they talked about it later. So, I could have done without that scene or the beginning part when they are talking about how a baby is formed."
2,It Was Baaaaddddd News!,"Before i purchased this software i was seriously excited, and thought ' Wow know i can carry on doing what i do, and continue and maybe extend my music making capabilities.' The day i recieved this product i picked it up and installed it. Straight away My 500 odd ram pc was saving it to my drive, v....e....r.....y..... slowly, but i thought it was normal. Then when i turned the software on, the large picture came on, making me think this software was going to be fun, easy and very user friendly, but guess what? IT WASN'T! It has a very difficult setting and is very hard to use and even though i read the manual i still didn't know how to use that thing!!!!!!!!! I would definetly suggest purchasing ""magix music maker 5 delux"" it is WEEEEYYYYY better!"
4,There is so little recorded music of James Booker...,"There is so little recorded music of James Booker that anything I come across is interesting.This is not a good introduction for a new Booker fan, but someone familiar with Booker's work will certainly enjoy this. You'll have to put up with some loud crowd conversation at times, some microphone feedback in the later tracks, and the amateurish cover artwork.However, I prefer his live recordings because I love to hear how he interacts with the crowd, and their response to his sudden tempo and emotional shifts. This recording gives you all that and plenty more. It's another little slice of his tremendous technique, puzzling mind, and infatuation with the ""CIA"".Kudo's to Document for finding/resurrecting this recording."
2,Not so great,This brush is okay. It does the job but every time I use it some hairs fall out. I Would never buy this one again.
2,"Double extend, I don't like it.","I usually use Double Extend Beauty Tubes, but thought I'd try the regular double extend. I'm disappointed and wasted my money. What I love about the tubes is that it truly extends and is very easy to clean off."
5,Great length and no smudging!,"I have been using this mascara for a few years now since I got it free to try as a BzzAgent. I have chronic dry eye due to LASIK vision correction, and I use eye drops SEVERAL times daily. L'Oreal Double Extend Mascara (and its sister product in the red tube) is the only mascara that doesn't smudge no matter how many times I apply eye drops. And I get super thick, yet natural-looking, lashes with NO CLUMPING! It also washes off very easily and thoroughly with the very gentle face wash I use daily. No need for expensive eye makeup remover. If this product ever gets discontinued, I don't know what I'll do!"
2,Not for volume,"After using this product, my eyelashes look so long and clumpy, it was awful! I can't believe that I wasted my money on this!"
2,TOO MUCH ANALYSIS FOR ME!,"The author deals not only with the concept of Christian Heaven, but some other religions as well. This would be a good book for someone who'se doing a study of beliefs of different religious groups on the subject of Heaven. Un- fortunately, that is not what I was looking for. The book is well written, but as far as I could tell as I tried to drag through all the psychology, it wasn't what I was expecting. Joseph Stowell's ""eternity"" is still my favorite. It deals much more on the spiritual level on the subject of Heaven. I'm not willing to completely give up on finishing this book, but it's not one you read in one sitting!"
1,Not his best work,"This is not Nance's best work, but it's a quick read and enjoyable for the most part. Parts a bit too far-fetched, even for non-pilots."
1,This only Jumps on the Hemingway Bandwagon,"Extremely disappointing. This was not interesting hardly at all, and it was a shameless cash-in on exploiting the Hemingway name. If you want to know about Cuba, The Buena Vista Social Club is a far better film. Seems like pre war Cuba would be quite the interesting topic, but this will not enlighten you to that. Bur you can learn how to make a good Mojito."
1,Norton Internet Security 2006 Ruined My Life for 2 Months,"I was running Norton Internet Security 2004, but I upgraded to Norton Internet Security 2006 when my subscription to Norton Anti-Virus lapsed. Rather than catalog all of the dozens of problems this program caused on my computer, I will simply advise anyone reading this to stay well away from it. It caused worse problems than any virus or trojan I have ever had. In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if their competitor's products started detective it as a virus in the future. I wasted so much time trying to get this product to work on my computer. I lost so much data. Just thinking about never using Norton products again makes me smile. Do not purchase this product unless you are a masochist and enjoy pain and suffering."
1,HORRIBLE SOFTWARE!,"not only does it slow my computer WAY down, but (like another reviewer said) it does not detect the spyware that i bought (that SYMANTEC TOLD ME TO BUY) it for! i told tech support at symantec my problem and they told me to buy this package and that it would get rid of it. i spent $130 on it and now another $300 to have a professional remove the spyware! as far as the antispam goes, it does not detect the real spam, but instead reports my emails to my boss as spam. it's the most ridiculous thing i've ever seen. stick with McAfee!"
1,Absolutely DO NOT download or install this product??,Unless you are a stand alone home user this is not a good product for a small business!!! The performance is choked after the initial software update. You cannot use a software loaded on your server. It totally locks up your system. You will need to reload Windows to get it back to a state where you can use your 2005 Symantecs.Please please be ware!!!
1,I'd rather have a virus,"Count on this software suite to take over your computer and slow it down to the point of being unbearable. I wish I had read the reviews here before buying it! I have had a few viruses, adware, spyware problems in the past but never did they frustrate me like this. In fact, I was always able to prevent and/or solve them with the help of a free anti-virus program available on the internet."
1,Don't say you weren't warned!,"I have used and endorsed Norton products for years, but no more. If you have any other norton products on your computer you will first need to uninstall them before installin NIS 2006 because they are not compatible. If you do not; you may find your computer unuseable. I have had numerous calls for help with failed installations and have had limited success repairing the damage done. Don't play Russian Roulette with your computer, there are better products out there for less money."
2,Lots of Problems,"Having used multiple copies of Norton Anti-Virus and Internet Security for years, I finally got fed up. Endless problems and lots of time spent with Indian tech support personnel. Conflicts with other software (particularly Microsoft Outlook), and blocking various things that shouldn't be blocked. The capper was the impossibility of uninstalling the 2003 and 2004 NAV products without calling technical support!Norton looks good and consistently gets the best reviews. However, the reviewers are not having to live with the endless problems associated with owning and using these products.After enduring this travesty for years, I recently switched to PC-cillin. it's a huge improvement. As stated by other reviewers, it doesn't hog resources and runs quietly in the background, getting the job done. What a relief!"
1,Awful,"As a (formerly) faithful and dedicated user of Symantec products I ignored the bad reviews and purchased and installed the 2006 version of NIS. What a mistake! I've had nothing but problems from scripting errors, adware getting through, the pc starting up in safe mode... I never had this problem before. The folks in San Jose must be asleep. Go with another product."
1,Norton has become garbage,"I used to love this product. Then I paid to renew my subscription, and now it throws a ""Key Abuse"" error.None of the solutions I've found on the web work, and there's no way to get ahold of anyone at Norton, unless you want to pay $50 to talk to someone with poor English skills and no technical skills.I'm forced to remove it and search elsewhere. Too bad, since I've used it for four years, but Norton has really gone downhill."
4,check indicator stays on?,"Pedal is fun...Jerry Garcia used one I believe. My concern is: When I am using an AC adaptor the ""check"" indicator light only dims when the effect is disengaged, rather than going completely out like other BOSS pedals I own. Is this YOUR experience? I am concerned about the implications for other connection in this particular pedal and the power waste/sheilding issues."
2,I Had High Hopes...,"I had High hopes for This Lord of The Rings Game.It started out beautifully. Vivid graphics, beautiful landscapes to explore. But by the 3rd level or so you start to realize the repetiveness in the game. The battle play was awesome for Aragon and The Grey Wizard, but Frodo's battle play was lack luster and boring. The story line lacked much compared to the books and the movie. And the enemies were easy to moderate in difficulty.This game had a chopped up ending aswell. An easy to beat Boss at the end and an ending that wasn't even half as desent as the ending of the acctual Fellowship.It left much to be desired."
4,Works fine but insanely loud,"It works as promised. Charge it up with your car (DC) or in your house (AC). But note that it WILL NOT run directly from AC current - you can only run it directly with DC current.This is because the AC/DC converter is small and cheap, so it does not have enough amps to run the pump directly. Note that this also means it charges MUCH more slowly on AC current vs DC (by a factor of 6 I believe). If you really care you can always find a more powerful AC/DC converter to overcome these limitations.One big complaint is that there is no smart charging circuitry, so you have to be careful not to overcharge it. A better device would let you plug it in whenever, for how ever long you want (like a cell phone) without hurting the batteries.Also, this thing is ridiculously loud, especially when the airflow is difficult (such as when your airbed is full). I have considered wearing earplugs but I'm not quite anal enough to remember them."
2,The pieces are sealed in bags. The kings top crown was seared off when we received it. Considering gluing it or returning it.,"Large chess set. Just started opening the packages.The black king has its head seared off before its baggie was opened.I opened the bags holding the pieces with my hands so know it was sent to us this way. My son does not want me to return it so we may keep it as it is. Still, I was not anticipating trying to glue something I just received. A little disappointing for me not too big of a deal to my little boy."
2,Delightful Adventure!,"""Meggie the Pup's Summer Adventure"" is a delightful adventure for dog lovers of all ages. The inventive and funny story is written in a way that makes you want to read more. And it gives you a great look inside your dog's emotions. Recommended both for reading to young children and for children who are starting to read...Dr. Kathleen Kain, scientist and educator."
3,Enjoyable,"Meant for teens but this old lady read it and enjoyed it. And the day to day pagan aspects are blended in the story well and very realistic. But then Silver is a bit of an expert on her path of paganism. And she always writes with integrity, clarity, simplicity and honesty."
5,Like all Silver's Books-Wonderful!,"Silver RavenWolf is my favorite author! All her books are filled with her good humor and marvelous talent. This book gave me chills! I was out on the edge of my seat throughout the WHOLE read! It kepted my attention and it was amazing! Again a wonderful experience! I recommend this book to anyone out there! I know you all love Silver, so get out there and buy this book! It is well worth the small fee!"
5,R.I.P. Doc,"If you didn't know, Vader drummer Doc has passed away. Read about at (...). Damn, why all of a sudden are all these great metal monsters dying? Doc was an amazing drummer. He had more talent in his nuts than every single nu-metal, metalcore, and emo band combined. He is gone buy certainly not forgotten. R.I.P. Doc. As for the album buy NOT JUST because it's awesome, buy it to keep Doc's memory alive. R.I.P. Doc :'("
3,Too Short.,"Great Game, but I only gave it 3 stars since the game was way to short. I finished this game in two days, about 4 hours. If you are into Mutiplayer, you will probably get a lot more play time from the game.Other than the game being short, I didn't find anything wrong and it was a lot of fun while it lasted."
1,Why don't you mention that this is an expansion pack?,"I bought this game as a pre-order and I checked, even more then once, that it doesn't say anywhere on the Amazon site that this is an add-on (expansion pack) and that it requires the Delta Force Black Hawk Down.Now, after waiting for so long, I realize that I have nothing to do with this game without the previous one...I think that it's not fair and that it is amazon's responsibility to provide me with this information before I'm buying..."
1,2 of a kind,can't rate! never got team sabre. i recieved 2 black hawk down instead. i don't know how that can get messed up.
3,Great art but not very helpful,This book is definitely not for beginners. I recommend this for skilled or somewhat intermediate artists.This book is good as a reference and nothing more. I wouldn't call this book instructive at all. The How to Draw Manga title is misleading. How to Draw implies instruction this book is more of a reference than instructional.
2,HOW TO COPY MANGA: ILLISTRATING BATTLES,"I looked forward to getting this book after I first ordered it.But to tell the truth, this book is just a giant reference. Dont you hate it when that happens.I mean, its always good to have a reference on hand, when you know what you are doing. But even ifyou are an expert, its a good idea to surround yourself with something you can always look back on andlearn from.So this book is good if you want to copy someoneelse's work, but if you are original then keep looking."
4,Good practice tests,"This book helped me to prepare for the NBCOT exam. The questions in the practice tests were formatted like on the NBCOT exam. Even though there were totally different questions on the NBCOT exam, I was able to reason through the questions from practicing these exams. There is one thing I didn't like about this book. It advertises over 1000 exam questions, however I noticed that after taking the first exam, some of the questions appeared in the remaining exams in the book. The fifth exam in the book contained no new questions, just questions from the first four exams that I had already seen before and knew the answers too."
2,Not that helpful,"Book itself was a little cumbersome to use. CD was better. Overall, questions did not even seem remotely similiar to the test exam questions. Unfortunately, there is not much better out there either."
3,Not all that and a bag of chips...,"The recipes in Cooking Light really weren't that light for me. Yes, they were definitely reduced from what the original recipe's dietary count was but, not the fat and calorie content I was looking for. I am trying to loose weight using a point system and, the calculated points for the recommended portions were quite large. I also found that many ingredients were hard to find in my area, if at all. Though, the recipes that I did make were all delicious."
2,It took forever!,"One evening, a very nice woman called me from New Mexico (I live in Virginia) saying that she had received a cookbook that I had ordered. Her name was on the shipping label and my name was on the packing slip. She had to return the book to the dealer and then they sent it to me, all of which took a very long time.Her order had been sent elsewhere - who knows where it landed. I will not order anything from this company in the future."
2,Very misleading name!,"Since being diagnosed with diabetes a while back, and being a dedicated foodie and decent cook, I've been collecting recipes appropriate to my new situation. Happily, there's quite a bit out there, and I had hopes for this nicely illustrated collection since it's published by one of the most popular food magazines around. Instead, I'm appalled at what they consider ""light"" cooking! ""Roasted Vegetable Pitas"" at 5 grams of fat and 54 grams of carbohydrates each! ""Broccoli-Rice Casserole"" at 7 fat and 48 carbs per serving! ""Mocha Fudge Pie"" at 7 fat and 52 carbs per slice! They also seem to consider ""one serving"" of pasta as being about three times the usual recommended amount -- 1-1/2 cups instead cup. I don't think they understand what's really needed by those trying to cut back on fat, starch, and sugar, or else their name is meaningless."
2,poorly designed product,"The DeLonghi 4 Cup Coffee Maker has a nice stainless carafe but otherwise is not worth the money. The lid is sealed with a flimsy elastic band which is displaced when removing and replacing the lid. When displaced the carafe will not fit in the coffee maker and it drips badly when attempting to pour into a cup. I finally had to remove the seal and pour with the lid off. The machine cuts off after brewing the coffee - no warming plate - coffee soon cold. There are no indicators for making a single cup of coffee - only a ""Max"" sign. The top to the coffee maker (where water is poured) is poorly fitted. And then, one of my pet peeves, there is a sticker which leaves a sticky residue when removed. Finally, the carafe lid cannot be placed in the dishwasher. Stay away from this one!"
2,Coffee simply was not hot enough!,"I bought this coffee maker online from ABT electronics. After using it for about 4 days, I had reached the conclusion that it was not going to work for me. While some folks might like their coffee served at a temperature just slightly above lukewarm, I am not one of them. I was thankful that ABT had a very friendly, no-questions-asked return policy. It is going back to them in the morning. Now, I just have to decide on another 4 cup coffeemaker to take its place."
1,Plastic Taste,"We have used this coffee maker for 2 weeks and can't get rid of the plastic taste to our coffee. We use Gevalia so its premium coffee. DeLonghi offered to send a new coffee maker, but wanted to charge a fee of $7. Also the lid to the carafe is too tight to remove without spilling the contents. Finally, the carafe is not truly a thermal carafe as it cools rahter quickly. Less aggravation just to throw out the coffee maker"
2,Took a Risk and Losing So Far...but rebounded!,"I read the reviews on this coffee maker and put it on my Christmas list anyway. I had a lot of trouble getting the carafe lid off and on, to the point where I wondered whether it was even supposed to come off! After only a couple of uses, the rubber seal on the lid broke. I am going to call customer service to see about getting it replaced. I'll update this review if I have any luck. UPDATE: GOT A REPLACEMENT PROMPTLY FROM CUSTOMER SERVICE, HAVE USED IT EVER SINCE (OVER A YEAR NOW) AND IT WORKS PERFECTLY. CHANGE MY RATING FROM A 2 TO A 4.Other than that, I love the look and compact design (I'm the only coffee drinker in my household), and it makes piping hot coffee! Brew process is slower than average, though."
1,Gave up,This book was very boring and filled with romantic cliches. I only got about half way through it and gave up.
3,Nice but not quite me.,I ordered this scent unsmelled based on the notes. It is a nice fragrance but not quite as sweet as I like them to be. I will probably wear it sometimes on winter evenings.
3,GOOD NEWS BIBLE.,"GOOD NEWS BIBLE,I PURCHASED MY BIBLES (2) OF THEM,ONE WAS ACCEPTABLE,BUT THE OTHER WAS UNACCEPTABLE,I WAS REALLY DISAPPOINTED AT THE CONDITION OF THEONE BIBLE."
3,Hot coffee,doesn`t live up to claim of keeping coffee hot for short period of time. Cools off too fast!
2,"Coffee maker okay, cup lid leaks",I have no complaints with the coffee maker however if you intend to use the carafe as a cup look elsewhere. The lid leaks and you will have coffee dripping down your shirt. A better design would be a lid you screw on similar to a hot thermos. Instead this lid 'snaps' on and is sealed with a rubber washer.I've given this 2 stars since a company like Delonghi should have figured this out before releasing the product. Remember functionality first then style.
2,Stomach-turning narration,"""Let's Roll"" is the story of the lives of Lisa Beamer of her husband Todd, who was killed aboard United Flight 93 on September 11th, 2001. See my review of the hard cover for details.The two stars are for the horrendous job of narration. Lisa Helms gives Lisa Beamer a voice that is so chirpy, perky and mindless that I could hardly stomach the book. The first 3-4 CDs were so relentlessly cute and smug that I almost couldn't stand listending to more. Only when the book rolled around the describing the events of 9/11 and its aftermatch did Helms calm down enough to be tolerable.Read the book, or skip the first 4 CDs if you have a weak stomach for saccharin."
4,Reverent,"I have enjoyed listening to this CD as I drop off to sleep, or when I wake up. It is very reverent and the tunes and words are very memorable. It uses a number of different instruments, as well as various soloists or groups singing throughout the CD. Variety, yet in good taste, is key here. I would rate the words and tunes as rating 5 stars, while the quality of some of the vocals occasionally drop down to about 3 stars. Instrumental, I would rate 4 stars. Overall I am very glad to have and to be able to listen to this CD."
2,"Got for free, not very good","This book is not the best, got it for free on my kindle but didnt help with the research paper I was writing."
4,Blinded by the Light (of the LEDs),"The lights on this mixer are far too bright. They're blinding if you're looking right at them!Aside from that, the quality is fine for the price, the features are decent, it's functional and sounds good enough for what I'm using it for. But I make no emotional connection with this hardware; I don't feel any loyalty to the product. If I were to lose it or it died, I would probably buy something different mostly because of the blinding lights.There is no reason not to buy this if you're looking for a cheap mixer at this price point. I'm using it as a line mixer so I can't speak to the quality of the mic pres."
1,Echo chamber,"It looks good but I get a constant echo. I had to go back to my old mixing board, money wasted I have never had problems with products I bought on Amazon but this is a reject."
4,Good Book for the buck.,Not enough pictures. Good information some I didn't know I would not recommend it to my friends . Just okay
2,Looks good. Brews bad.,"My wife searched low and high for a good coffeemaker to replace our free Gevalia automatic coffee maker. We couldn't find everything we wanted (12 cup, carafe, automatic timer) in one item, but the DeLonghi looked good. Starbucks' new line of coffemakers was supposedly going to be made by DeLonghi, so we figured it had to be good. We got it and it looked good. However, it never worked right. The carafe release that allows you to pour during brewing did not fit correctly and the coffee would back up in the funnel until it overpoured. I finally took the piece out so that it would flow directly into the pot even though I couldn't pour during the brew cycle. But even then, the filter would back up and allow grounds into the coffee pot. I'm getting rid of this lemon and recommend that you be careful before buying this product."
4,"Works very well, for me.","This unit seems to give fairly accurate results when compared to lab readings on my last CBC work-up. I needed to modify the blood sampling procedure, leaving out the pipette step by applying the blood drop directly to the testing strip, but once I got my routine down, it was very easy to run tests. I recommend this unit, as long as you are wiling to take the time to read, and understand, the manual and take the time to take, and apply, good samples. The lancette device is relatively pain-free, but you must be willing to hold it firmly against your finger and be ready for that little jump when it makes contact. Once I got used to everything, I was very glad I bought this unit. After almost two years, it still gives me reliable service."
2,It SUcked,"well...I've read all of feists books and I know how good of an author he is...but when i read this book I new it had everything to do with making the money and little to do about the book...It was the most boring feist book I've read...the game was great, but he should have left the game seperate andthe book seperate.."
1,"Oh my god ,Feist is well thought of ?","This was truly awful.To be frank,it was junk.There was nothing in his chapters but action .Action action action.Too much action.No character detail ,no good plot ,just fight fight fight.It seemed to me like Feist could think of nothing to put in but fighting.Is Feist as weak minded as that ?Well,it seems so.Feist is one of the top fantasy authors .I've never seen this before."
2,What Happened?,"I have read the first four books by REF and i loved them. So my addiction took me to BookStop where i picked up Krondor The Betrayal...WHAT HAPPENED FEIST? I thought you were interesting, with in-depth characters and meaningful plot. Apparently not. The characters are always traveling and i feel like most of the book is made up of isolated scenes with some new incompetent ""assasins"" to fight. This book deserves 1 star. The 2nd is for bringing back memories of the once great characters Pug and Jimmy. REF---->You could have done *much* better."
1,This stinks,"The book is horrible. It's about the video game, and money. It reads like a video game. HELlO? That's wrong. That's bad.When the plot is: ""In order to pass by, you must complete a mission..."" over, and over, and over, it's time to laugh or cry with Raymond Feist.I was a fan, but now I'm going back to Mystery section, and yes...Non-fiction. I blame the corporate money grabbers for ruining the name of Science Fiction!"
4,Read it if you miss your Riftwar friends.,"Though not as masterful as his original Riftwar Saga, or even the Serpentwar Saga that followed, this tale of the events that took place ten years beyond the Riftwar is a good read for a Feist fan.Those who are not Riftwar afficionados, but are looking for a good fantasy read would be best suited to begin with the Riftwar Saga itself or at least one of the other side sagas, as this book is definitely NOT a standalone."
3,Mediocre,"This book was written like a computer game. Not really surprising since it was based on one but computer games do not make good books. I have never play the game myself , though I intend to, and looking at this book from a completely objective standpoint it just wasn't very good. I really enjoyed reading ""Magician"" and the serpent war saga but this book doesn't hold a candle to any of his other works. It seemed as if it was written for a thirteen year old. Perhaps I have been spoiled by reading books by people like David Eddings, C.S. Freidman, Robin Hobb and Robert Jordan, just to name a few, but I think that the writing of this book could be improved a great deal. Despite how it might sound I did enjoy this book and while perhaps I wouldn't buy it, it is worth a look."
2,Krondor the Betrayal,"Ehh its a god book..but leaves much untouched like who the new charcter...(Crawler, and the suspose dead Dark elf cheiftain) (...) I gives this a two only beause it a new book to a new seris and lacks lots of surpirses and and fun that happen with the Riftwar saga. So im looking forward to book 2 and seeing if my question can come anwser"
5,Excellent in some respects,"Althoug the story does not go with the over all stories of midkemia it is a great story. It has to do with the lifestone at sethanon and the Moredehel. The story is, as usual for fiest, good and I would recomend it for anyone who wants to start reading about the magical world of Midkemia."
4,The Best Diet,I would recommend this product to anyone (young and old) for losing weight. The book guides you step by step on how to increase daily activities and the pedometer motivates you to make additional steps. I love it!
2,Never did get it to calculate correctly,"I tried several different positions and the steps were always off, sometimes by quite a bit. I started using my android instead. It's much more accurate."
3,good product but overpriced,"The rug is very nice and it is obviously of high quality. However, I don't think it is $165 worth of quality. I wish I would've just bought the gel mats they sell at Lowe's."
4,Gelpro Mats,"Mats are great, but we bought 3 small ones for our kitchen & wish we had bought larger ones. They feel nice, but do slide a bit on the floor."
5,Gelpro mat is fantastic!,"Absolutely fabulous! It has really saved my back and legs during holiday cooking. I highly recommend this product! It took me a long time to talk myself into spending that much money for a mat, but it is well worth every penny."
5,"Love them, surprised most don't","My husband insisted on purchasing two of these mats for my kitchen. I have MS and Fibromyalgia making it difficult to stand in front of the sink or stove for an extended period of time. These mats make my chores much more comfortable. They are heavy, which can make it hard for me to move and clean but worth it for the added comfort."
5,Schütz: Symphoni Sacr III,"Schütz: Symphoni Sacr III is a 2005 Harmonia Mundi recording under the direction of Konrad Junghängel who leads the Cantus Cölln & Concerto Palatino. Peter Wollny has written the music notes and Charles Johnston has translated them into English. Lyrics are available in German, French and English. Amazing painting on the cover. Being a very devout person the lyrics had a significant meaning to me. Highly recommended indeed. 5/5"
4,Very Helpful Book,"This is a very helpful book for anyone working to implement the Capability Maturity Model. The author describes the culture that is necessary for effective process improvement, and clarifies the CMM terms, making them easier to use. He also describes the need for metrics in process improvement, and recommends methods for capturing and using the information you collect. There is also a very helpful chapter on assessments. Overall I found the book informative and easy to read."
1,Disjointed writing,"Quite a story, deserving a better writer. The second half of the book is about a man drafted into the Vietnam war. Be advised."
2,Great 10 years ago!,"If you are a new MT, an updated version of this book will be of help you. If you are a senior MT, as I am, and transcribe many operative reports, I recommend the Stedman's books: Stedman's Surgery Words, and Stedman's Equipment Words."
3,Nice looking but flimsy,"Looks very neat, quite small, but the material is so light that it doesn't sit flush with the wall (it's a little warped). Also, it comes with velcro strips to hang with, but they don't withstand much weight - I used a couple of tacks instead."
2,Be carefull it may not be the right one for your car,Be careful when you order this I have 1992 300zx Twin Turbo with a flush mount wing that comes all the way down to the trunk lip. This spoiler is a flush mount but does not come all the way down to the lip of the trunk I called the company and they are working to resolve the problem. I had to reorder through another vender. The pictures were just not clear enough and it said it surpassed OEM. Be clear on what you need The company only has this style and one that sets on pedestal legs.
1,Ummm...NO!,"Pool of Radiance was entertaining even though it was simple; Pools of Darkness is just plain dumb. Maybe Jane Cooper Hong should've helped on this one too. The idea of a Red Mage powerful enough to transport an entire city to an underground cavern is hard to believe. However, if your imagination and faith in magic's power let you get over that, then you have to believe that he is too weak to conquer it himself and needs to rely on armies of humanoid thugs to do it for him. Obviously, Phlan's Captain of the Guard has read the player's handbook and DMG rulebooks from Advanced Dungeons and Dragons. Read the book and you will know what I mean.I'm getting sick reviewing this book so I will quit.Basically, DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME WITH THIS ONE!"
3,Inspired by ancient music more than a reconstruction,"This is interesting work, but not quite what one might expect. Other CD's of ""Ancient Greek music"" are attempts to play what scraps remain of written musical notation survives (more than a dozen such pieces are extant). This CD features music played by reconstructed instruments, but the compositions are fanciful. A few feature lyrics from archaic Greek poetry (Anacreon, Alcaeus, Sappho, Archilochus, Bacchylides and the Homeric Hymn to Sleep), but none tackle ancient musical compositions. That said, the music is pleasant, and if you want to hear what some of the instruments sound like, this is useful. But there's not much reason to think this is what ancient Greek MUSIC would have sounded like, more like later music played on ancient Greek instruments."
4,outside the souvlaki box,"not your ""never on sunday"" style music. some very unique sounds, melodies and chords. enjoy as you read the fagles' homer trnslations."
2,Half Way Job,"These do exactly what they're intended for: to save your slide from dents. What isn't mentioned; though, is the fact that they will not stay put on your horn, instead, they will scratch the finish on the slide. The $4 plastic tubes eventually will make a $600 slide look like a horn that has been through 8+ years rough of marching band. However, this is perfect for marching band trombone slides."
2,Don't Bother,"It is generally not regarded as a good idea to add weight to your slide. However, these barely weigh anything. For me, their biggest discouragement to use was in the fact that I used them on my marching horn and if it rained, water could work its way underneath the ends of these and I'd have to remove them to dry, which was a pain. I ultimately decided to leave these off."
5,The Star,"Because of the title, I got Skibbins' #4 Tarot related book, ""The Hanged Man,"" first - then I found out about his other books, all with the name of a Tarot card for a title, now have all four. They are independent, but run in a series. ""The Star"" is as good as the other three. Now I will read ""The Hanged Man"" again!Easy to read amateur detective story, interesting main character, probably influenced by the author's alter-ego. The main protagonist, Warren Ritter, does Tarot readings on the side, doesn't believe in it as real, but then, just maybe once in a while. That is what drew me in, but his cast of characters are interesting, and the books are a lot of fun. Great diversion, and just a bit inspiring, as well. I'd like to meet the author.Waiting for ""The Tower"", his next.Larry Heath"
3,"Slow, but intelligent read","I studied political science in college and consider myself to be interested in politics, especially foreign policy. Despite that, I found it very difficult to make may way through this book. While the subject matter was interesting, the style made it difficult to read large portions of the book in a single sitting. However, that should not take away from the obvious intelligence and research that went into this book. The description of the four various school of foreign policy is quite thorough and sheds light on how both the public and elected officials view the United States' role in the world. The book provides an excellent description and history of foreign policy, but those looking for a prediction on the 21st century will be disappointed. Those who have only a cursory interest in foreign policy should look elsewhere. Those who read anything they can get their hands on in terms of foreign policy would benefit the most from this book."
5,laugh oiut loud,"I've shown this book to many friends. Watching as they look through it, I have yet to find one person who does not laugh out loud, usually within the first few pages, and then it gets louder. Callahan spoofs holy cows others dare not touch."
2,Unreadable,"The text tries to do a good job at citing sources, but it unreadable. There is very little content in the text. There are words; not meaning."
1,False advertising,"This oven is NOT easy to clean! I have the AD 1079 Model which is TOP of the line. They say the interior is Dura-stone... what they DON'T tell you that's ONLY the sides and the pans. The top of the interior is RAW METAL... impossible to clean! The metal absorbs all splatters and turns them black so you look like you have a peppered oven. One use of the rotisserie and the interior is shot. You can NOT use scouring pads or oven cleaners. The oven functions fine so far but with the grease build up on the top I can only assume it's performance will deteriorate. I would never purchase a Delonghi product again. I called them and they said ""well, we didn't specifically say the top was Dura-stone!"".For the price I feel ""ripped off""! And the exterior is NOT ""cool touch"". It produces more heat than my oven does. I am VERY disappointed. Look at the other less expensive brands. You will get NO satisfaction from Delonghi."
2,Dont pull the middle tray out!,"This oven does cook well but mine has a serious flaw. If you are cooking on the middle shelf and pull it out to check or remove, the tray will fall to the side and spill the pan contents and possibly burn the cook in the process. The interior of the unit is wider than the tray when it is pulled out. With the tray completely recessed it does stay in the track. just don't pull it out! This is hazardous and a significant flaw in the ergonomic design."
1,Yuk! Not enough Merle Too Much Chester,"Don't bother purchasing ""California Blend"". Don't get me wrong. I love Merle Haggard music. His CD ""Peer Sessions"" is the best I've ever heard. ""California Blend"", however, does not have enough Merle in it to save it. Chester just ain't that good. Period. The first couple of cuts featuring Merle are OK, then the CD dies - quickly. Skip this one. Save your money for ""Peer Sessions""."
3,Not an action flick,"Not sure why I went into this film thinking it was a fists of fury action flick in the spirit of Jet Li or Tony Jaa. If thats what your looking for then this film is definitely not going to satisfy you. It has a decent bar fight but other than that the few fight scenes are very muted and are definitely geared towards the artistic, symbolic theme which is perfectly fine but unfortunately I was geared up to watch some good old fashioned action and this was the wrong movie to see. I still give it three stars because I liked the actor who plays the instructor and there were enough twists to keep me somewhat interested."
5,Realistic Martial Arts Drama,"The best martial arts movie I have ever seen. The story was realistic and the fight scenes were too, no strings, CGI, and one of the best endings I have ever seen! The acting by the lead role was outstanding. Martial artists will relate and appreciate!"
2,too much to take in,"There always seems to be one too many ideas in an Egan novel. For me there always seems to be a point when things just get too strange or too unbelievable and I mentally pop out of the story like a penguin popping out of the sea onto an ice floe. This happens even in the Egan novels that I like, like Teranesia with the madcap biotech being done in a dinghy out on the open sea. Or in Permutation City with the ""dust theory"". In this novel the vendeks and their universe with its strange physics eventually became too strange and tedious to keep me engaged. And it all was a bit too easy. If it is so simple to create a new universe teeming with life, then such life is too cheap to be worth the weighty discussions and agonizing that filled half this book. If it's them or us, then I choose us. Kill them all, and redo the experiment with better controls. The fact that the characters couldn't make this simple decision made the novel a very tough read."
2,Rocket Downer,"This took a long time to put together and was pretty complicated. Most children will need their parents help. You need to use vinegar with the rocket which, of course, is very smelly as well as baking soda. The biggest problem with the rocket was it did go up but it didn't glide thru the air it just came crashing down and the wings kept breaking off. We've flown it that one day and it sits in the corner of the garage probably never to be used again."
1,This belongs in a garbage can,"You would think a cardboard storage box would be a simple enough product, but not this BCW Monster 4 Row Storage Box. While it took over *a month* to arrive, when I finally got it all it was was 4 cardboard panels in a plastic bag. No instructions on how to assemble it anywhere to be found. I expected to receive the box fully assembled, but I guess not. I wouldn't have had a problem with assembly if I had any instructions, but no. You're just sent four cardboard panels with perforations all over them and not a clue given as to how to assemble it.Thanks for nothing I guess."
4,nice work,"a most enjoyable, penetrating look into the mind of a genius. We see the beauty of Laing's thought and his amazing contributions to the field of mental health. We are treated to a thorough character assessment and loving, if at times probing, analysis of what Laing was all about.This work is written in a conversational but educated tone that lends itself nicely to the subject matter.Highly recommended if you have not read all the others."
3,Cheaply made!,Spring popped off and needle went to 900* . Had to put back together and bend back side of pointer to hold it in place. Seems fine now but should have ordered another Rutland.
5,Very well made high quality part,"Wish everything were designed and made so well. Looks great, feels great. Works perfectly. Highly recommend. If only the female connector was so well made."
1,"Fake QURAN UL HAKIM, stay away","After such a bloody controversy of cartoons of PROPHET(nauazo billah),Amazon.com should not have placed such items on their web site,being a well wisher just wanna suggest that plz remove this item from here ASAP, as this is not true QURAN UL HAKIM.Due to growing tensions between muslims and non muslims this site should try to bridge that gap,whereas such publications will widen the gap bc Quran Ul Hkim can never be changed its saved in our hearts,plz dont ignore this..........."
1,A Failed Attempt to Appease Christians and Possible tool of USA propaganda,"""The True Furqan"" is being described as the ayats of the Shaytan and Al-Furqan weekly magazine has found out that the two American printing companies;'Omega 2001' and 'Wine Press' are involved in the publishing of 'The True Furqan', a book which has also been titled 'The 21st Century Quran'!It is being distributed to children in Kuwait in the private English schools!The book contains 77 Surats, which include Al-Fatiha, Al-Janaand Al-Injil.Instead of Bismillah, each Surat begins with a longer version of this incorporating the Christian belief of the trinity, And this so called Poetry opposes many Islamic beliefs. in one of its Verses it describes having more than one wife as fornication, divorce being non-permissable and it uses a new system for the sharing out of the will, opposing the currentone.It states that Jihad is forbidden.All this is poisoning our children."
1,Dont give your opinion about others religin without knowing it,All those who have a bad opinion about islam i would say such people to first read holy Quran. You will change your view on islam
1,Seems to be a trick,Hello.Seems to be a big trick that some people have purported the real Holy Quran for heinious reasons and want their own ideas poisoning the tender minds of children and even most adults.Please boycott this quran and let as many poeple know about this as u can.May this come to an end and may the author realise whats he doin
1,Caution,"I managed to get access to a copy of this startling interpretation on my recent visit to Kuwait. I have to say for anybody wanting to read the Quran, this may be a dissapointment.It is a collection of certain verses from the Quran with a collection of what can only be recognised as a philosophers attempt to write poetry. This book is most definately not the Quran, so I cannot see the value in its acquisition for that purpose, The Holy Qur'an: Text, Translation & Commentary, would be better for that, also available at amazon; [...]However it would be interesting to see a genuine attempt by the american publishers of this book and its writer, to try and change the core of the beliefs of Muslims.'Freedom', 'Civilisation', & 'Liberty' ahhh, bliss. God Bless America!"
1,Worst Translation Ever!,"I don't claim to be an expert in the science of translation or Arabic or even English for that matter but I can easily see that this is the worst translation of the Quraan ever, and I have seen some pretty weak translations. I held it up to a fully Arabic Quraan and it literally means something completely different. It even has half of the pages of the real Quraan. How can the author expect to fill both English and Arabic in only 300 pages when it would require at least 1000?! Ignore this book completely! How do I select ""0 stars""?"
1,God's answer to it.,"""Fain would they extinquish God's Light with their utterance, for God will fulfill His Light though Unbelievers resist it. He it is Who sent His Messenger with Guidance and the religion of Truth that it may be proclaimed over all religion though polytheists desist."" (Surah 61:8-9)."
1,Fake,"This is so untrue. It doesn't even have a normal arabic poetic style. There absolutely no comparison between the Quran and this fake book which i like to call al-batil instead furqan because it does not deserve the name furqan. I read most of it, and all of what it says does not make sense."
1,"RUBBISH ,","This is true waste of time, spoilt effort and totally nonsense.Idiot tried to produce and twisted divine words. If you looking for right path and true direction follow one and only, unchanged, true words spooken by Allah Almighty through his Prophet Muhammad PBUH, HOLY QURAN. Rest is Devil production better than nothing.No one can produce a single word of Holy Quran.This book is useless."
1,HOW SAD!,"Subhan Allah, Truly it is very sad. I converted to Islam 11 years ago and someone at my father's church gave him this book for me to read. I read the first few chapters and even as a new Muslim I started laughing. Certainly people are intimidated by the perfection of Islam that they have to expend time and energy creating ""The true Furqan"". It is so obviosly written by Christians and that is the saddest part. You are spreading a lie against GOD, against YOUR OWN GOD! Do you not know that there is ONLY ONE GOD? Any how, we shall see the outcome of this. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY PEOPLE. IF you truly want to read the Qur'an get one translated by Yusuf Ali or simply look up and call the nearest MOsque around you. They will be so happy to give you a REAL Qur'an. Then... you decide for yourselves. May Allah (GOD) guide us All. Very sad that Christians have come this low."
1,shame on the publishers,"Shame on all of the publishers, do u think u can change the word of the words of THE GLORIFIED,THE HOLY, THE SUBDUER,THE WISE, THE POWERFUL, THE FULFILLER, THE GUARANTOR,THE HELPFUL, THE WATCHFUL, THE ALL-AWARE, THE MOST FORGIVING, THE EVER EXISTING, THE CREATOR, THE MAKER,THE PROTECTOR, THE NOBLE, THE ONE FREE FROM ALL THAT IS ATTRIBUTED TO HIM, THE LORD OF THE GREATEST THRONE, THE LORD OF THE WORLDS AND THE SEVEN HEAVENS, THE UNIQUE, THE MOST GENEROUS, THE CREATOR OF CREATIONS, THE LORD OF AWE AND POWER, THE POSESSOR OF POWER AND AUTHORITY? No. Allah promised to guide The Holy Qura'an till the last day. Nobody on earth can temper wit the wasaal talk mo' of the harruf.This is to the publishers;-you idiots may your souls perish in the blazing hellfire. Ameeni'm even ashamed of rating this 1 star, its cos i hav to post a review to help muslims. may Almighty Allah forgive my soul, Ameen"
1,Qur'an is unique and and variants of them can not be thought...,"Is this a joke? Is this a caricature?Anyone who knows some about Islam, knows that there have been one type of Qur'an since it was written other variants cannot be thought. You can change the font family of letters and maybe change the thickness of the cover but you cannot play with its inside.if you erase or change even one letter you change the whole meaning of a verse.As muslims we behave so sensitive even we are buying a commentary of Quran,we musn't do what they wan't,please do not buy this product.MA'A EL SELAMEH. FI'MAN ALLAH.SALAM ALEYQUM,BAYRAM"
1,YOU WILL GO TO HELL,"FROM THE REAL QURAN:ALLAH C.C. SAYS YOU INFIDEL!!SURAH AL-HIJR PART 14 AYET 9VERILY, WE, IT IS WE WHO HAVE SENT DOWN THE QURAN AND SURELY, WE WILL GUARD IT..IT S ENOUGH FOR YOU"
1,Total waste!,"This is not a book to be read nor to be listened to. Total waste of time and money.Instead, read and listen to the real Al-Qur'an.Anwar Buchoo"
1,this book is utterly stupid,Do not think that you will succeed in your goal. SUrely Allah will destroy you ppl. And you will for sure see the Hellfire.
5,"It's a good book, why all the negativity","[...] This is an arabic poetry book which [...] is trying to unite Christianity and Islam by showing what the two largest religions have in common with one another. I read the book online myself, but I certainly would recommend it to people who enjoy reading poetry or people who want to know how much Islam and Christianity agree with each other. It gets 5 stars from me because it's a good book."
1,SHOULD BE BANNED FROM PUBLICATION,"ALL I CAN SAY IS THAT ALLAH WILL NOT LET THIS GO ON ANY FURTHER. AND FOR WHOEVER WROTE IT, THEY WILL BE JUDGED AND PUNISHED BY ALLAH. ALL I CAN SAY IS THAT ALL MUSLIMS MUST GET TOGETHER AND ACT ON THIS!!! I AM DISGUSTED JUST BY HEARING FROM THIS BOOK OF ALL THE FALSE AND MISLEAD INTERPRETATION OF THE REAL QURAN. OH AND BY THE WAY THIS BOOK DOES NOT EVEN DESERVE A STAR"
1,its the Devil game ... again and again,"i m not going to waste my time in reading such a book which will be full of flaws and ignorance.The reason is,this book namely (The True Furqan)is being written by man ( bunch of rascals) and the real Quran is being written by Great Allah Almighty (all praise to him)and even an idiot knows that God is creator and creator is always superior than his creation..... so how this book can be compared with the real one ""Quran"" .... think.."
1,Excuse me for NOT rating this book.,"I will not rate this book(but i choose one since i should to be able to comment) cuz i didnt read it and i dont think that i will ever do. Why comparing this book with Quran and why saying that its better?!! since when humans words are better than God's?! And please dont use muslim fake names to write your reviews about this book, if you publish it and believe that it is the right one then use your real name and publish your comment since you think that what's written in it is good and worth reading. This book wont ever change a true muslim mind and no good muslim will ever believe in what's written in it even if its written in a nice and beautiful way. A true muslim wont ever leave the ONLY QURAN to this non titled book."
1,found bugs in it..,"I should say I loved it when I bought it a while ago, but never looked so close at it! My wife showed me a few very small bugs floating on the water in the rice cooker. Not going to send them back since I did used some of it and not worth the try. Hope that it was in a batch of it and the manufacturer can read and figure out this. not going to buy it again."
3,Well....,"It didn't really look like the picture at all and it looks kind of thin. It's still really pretty and my girlfriend liked it so that was a plus. It did arrive in a timely fashion but the part about it shipping within 24 hours is a lie. Overall, I'm satisfied with this ring."
5,Silver really comes through with this one!,"I have all of Silver's books, and many, many others. When I'm in a pinch, this is the one I always go to first. The ""Stop a Bad Case of Gossip"" is great!"
1,NOT helpful advice...,"This book panders to the emotional insecurities of youth. The instances of ""psychic attack"" which are actual, are a minute percentage compared to those claimed by teen-aged drama queens. SRW tends [especially with this work] to cater to the dramatics of the teen-aged mentality.If you are searching for a serious book concerning protection for home, land, and psyche, I highly recommend ""Psychic Protection: Creating Positive Energies for People and Places,"" by William Bloom [ISBN: 0684835193], instead of a book which preys on the fears and insecurities of a juvenille mind.While Bloom isn't my favorite author on any subject, at least he isn't selling poison to children."
1,Not the best Dead Sea Scrolls video,"In a class I saw a fascinating 2-hour Discovery Channel video about what the Dead Sea Scrolls say -- competing cults attacking each other, destroying each others' sacred documents, turning myths into stories of real events and real events into myths, all shedding insights into the origins of the New Testament. I mistakenly bought this video instead. This video is 50 minutes about students from Brigham Young University trying various high-tech stuff at the Qumran archeological site. Analyzing the jars, and discovering that the clay came from the area where the jars were found. Gee, wow. This tape is boring. There is nothing on this video about what the Dead Sea Scrolls say.--Review by Thomas David Kehoe..."
2,"Some challenge, but went to fast ...","I hoped that this would had been a bit more of a challenge. Granted some of the puzzles were challenging, but the next puzzle to come along in the same style/format ... you knew what to do. I also hoped I would not complete this book in less than a single afternoon. I see this book more challenging for Teenagers and Young Adults. Hope this helps."
4,I Love These Puzzles!,"This is a great puzzle book. The puzzles are not so hard that I can't figure them out, but still challenging. I would recommend it."
5,Best Wooden Train Ever!,"This is a fabulous train set, suitable for children as young as my grandson, who is not quite two years old. It has a wonderful variety of tracks and cars, as well as lovely trees, street signs and other accessories. It is very, very durable, yet is simple to put together, especially the cars, which simply click together via magnets. Personally, I think it's one of the best toys I've seen for interactive play! You can make a simple circle line or an elaborate railway system, or you can just play with the engines and cars, alone. Such versatility and allowance for imagiative play is refreshing. The wood is smooth (so no splinters) and the colors are very nice. I highly recommend this set, which is moderately priced, for anyone who wants to have years of fun with his/her child(ren)."
4,train review,Great birthday gift for a two year old. My husband built an amazing train table and it fit perfectly. Kids are having fun on it and it is quite durable.
4,"Nice set, but won't work with Thomas metal trains","Very good set, great value, works nicely with wooden Thomas trains, but if you have the take-along metal Thomas trains they won't fit on these tracks. That was a big surprise and disappointment. However, my son has enough wooden trains to still enjoy these tracks. His gray plastic tracks accommodate both the wooden and metal trains, as do our neighbor's more expensive wooden set. You may be better off buying a set that accommodates both wooden and metal. I would probably return this and get the other wooden tracks if I had the time to do this."
3,hope you have patience...,"We got this for my 2yo. It took my husband and I over an hour to put it together. Many of the pieces just did not fit. I was a good thing we had some other Brio and Thomas tracks to substitute. And don't even bother trying to follow the diagram tht comes with it. It's not even close. It was such a pain that once we got it assembled, we decided to glue it to the train table because I didn't EVER want to do that again. Also, the quality of the trains are not as good as the Thomas ones. However, at $90, it was much more affordable than Thomas. That being said, both my 2 and 4 year old LOVE it and play with it for hours."
4,BEYOND KENPO,Fast effective techniques that are revolutionary in increasing speed and brutality. The moves can standup to takedowns from jujitsu and other arts. Then you add a knife or stick and you have a complete fighting system without having to learn new forms for weapons use.
4,Finally! A book to help dreaming Anime-artists,I've been looking for a long time to find a book to assist me in drawing proper anime women. This is the book!
2,what happened to Joe?,"People ask,""What happened to Joe Farrell, why didn't he get the fame he deserved?"" This album makes it all clear. Disco happened to Joe. It doesn't matter how good his solos are; when packaged in a disco format, they're as solid as Twinkies. Did Joe follow his heart? If you like Washington Jr., you'll like this... maybe. If you like open ended jazz from when Joe remembered hard bob and added space, look for Outback, or Quartet (sometimes called Follow Your Heart, or Song of the Wind)when Chick Corea kept things real. Of course, La Caterdral El Toro may be better to dance to..."
2,a nightmare.....,"I bought two of the product with intention of networking my XP laptop to my wifes Win98 PC. I give Netgear the merit of having decent customer support. They got the product to work.... at the expense of all other network connections. Since I installed the product, I had to reinstall Win XP Home Edition twice, after countless errors. Also, my wife's Win 98SE was not able to recognize her printer since the install of the network. I uninstalled the product from both computers. Thank God my laptop is fine (after the reinstall and loss of info). My wifes PC STILL has problems with finding the printer.I dont recommend this product to anyone..."
1,A disappointment,"I bought this book hoping it would help me understand end time prophecy, especially the 70th week of Daniel. I read other materials on the subject, which were well researched and worth the read. This book was not in the same league - I could not finish it. The book IS NOT scholarly, it gives no historical support for its interpretations. Hated the tone, too. The author is expressing his subjective opinion about the end times, and makes a lot of assumptions about what the prophecy text means, without any support."
1,Disappointing text selection,"You will not learn what you need to know from this text. It is terribly written and does not give clear definitions or examples. Get something else, especially if you have to use this for a class. You will be lost without an exceptional instructor."
1,Don't waste your money....stick with your hard copy,This Ebook Bible I have found does not work AT ALL!!! The only thing that will come up is the Table of Contents. You touch a Chapter...it immediately takes you back to the table of contents.....no matter what you do....it takes you to the Table of Contents.....At one point it did take me to the book of Genesis..butI have no idea how I finally arrived there. This is not user friendly....or user at all..in fact it is useless......It is ashame that you can not get refunds on ebooks. Would not recommend this ebook bible to anyone. I gave it one star only because I had to.
1,NIV Study Bible is dsappointing,I too wish I had read the reviews before I bought this Bible. Didn't think I'd need to since I've used a hard copy of this version for years. But the Kindle version is a major let down. Why indicate study notes and not show them? Why can't I search for a specific scripture? And why can't small graphics be zoomed up to full screen? All are features available in the ESV study Bible. Amazon should tell customers study notes are not available in the Kindle version or get the publisher to fix it. I really feel ripped off by this purchase.
5,Grand Minor League truly is Grand!,"In this book, Dick Dobbins took a cue from the book, ""The Glory of Their Times,"" interviewing numerous ex-PCL players and umpires about the league. This oral history of the league is an excellent look back. Reading this book takes you back to a different era of baseball and shows why the PCL deserved to be called the ""Grand Minor League.""The book has chapters on the league's various ballparks over the years, the league's great teams and rivalries. There are numerous pictures of various players, managers, umpires and team owners throughout the book. There are also pictures of various teams' uniforms, hats and other assorted memorabilia.Dick Dobbins put a lot of hard work and dedication into this book and it shows. Any baseball history fan will love this book."
1,"Beware - If you love animals this is NOT a ""classic"" !!","While talking up the author and this ""wonderful"" book, no one seems to think about mentioning the fact that there is some very graphic writing about animals being killed. Granted, most of these ""killings"" are necessary for food, but some are not. At the very least, a warning should be given to children, and adults for that matter, that this is NOT a light-hearted story about a boy and his fawn. While I could accept most of the hardness of the story, the ending is so traumatic that I wouldn't suggest anyone with a love for animals read this book. Or watch the movie either. You're much better off with something along the lines of Lassie!"
3,Interesting but not what I expected,"I am an adult with Asperger's Syndrome with children on the spectrum. I found this book interesting but difficult to read. Mrs. Cutler has classical literary aspirations that made the style of writing a bit rambly and metaphorical. I felt I had to decode it as I read, but maybe NTs would not have to. I was disappointed by the way that she repeatedly said that people with autism were ""missing"" certain NT traits. She seemed to feel sorry for all of us, not just the children who were poorly treated by psychiatrists in the past. Many of us are full of joy to see the world in a different way and would never wish to be like everyone else.--K. A. Quinn"
4,Classic piston 3,"I was advised by a horn collector that this was the best oil for antique horns. I have several middle-range horns that the regular valve oil didn't work well with. This product is synthetic oil and indeed works well for the older instruments. I have noticed, though, that #3 needs to be applied almost daily."
2,Barely works,"I bought this for my 8 year-old for his birthday. Huge disappointment. While the set is made very well, don't expect it to work very well. Either the bow is not strong enough to launch the arrows properly, or the arrows are too heavy for the strength of the bow. Take your pick. I tried to tighten the string on the bow but that didn't help. We put up the target in the family room and the arrows barely flew ten feet. And that was flying like a rainbow, not straight. They also wobble horribly during flight, making it almost impossible to stick to anything upon landing. If you just want something for ""pretending"" and something ""very safe"", this is the set for you. Otherwise, look elsewhere."
3,Good shampoo for kitten,"We rescued a three month old kitten that has round rough scaly patches on his back. After reading reviews of several products on amazon.com, I decided to orderEQyss Micro-Tek Medicated Pet Shampoo, 16-Ounce,Keratolux Shampoo 16oz, andNaturasil Homoeopathic Remedies for Pet Mange, 60 ml, 2 Ounce. First I used the EQyss shampoo twice in one week, and the kitten's one rough scaly patch escalated to three patches. Next I used the Keratolux shampoo twice in one week, and the patches started receding, and his fur began to grow back, but the rough scaly patches remained. Today I used the Naturasil product, and was astonished to see the scaly debris coming loose from his skin. The EQyss shampoo left the kitten fresh smelling, and we'll definitely be able to use it for normal bathing of other cats."
4,Good stuff,"Got this for my dog, because of a yeast infection. It seems to work great. Nice shine. It keeps her coat looking better, for over a week."
5,Great book for all levels of collectors,"Being a 'newbie' to View-Master collecting this was one of the first books I picked up. It is very informative, well laid out and a terrific reference book. I've been able to classify my collection with ease. A must have!"
3,"Entertaining, but series is running out of steam.","Somehow between ""The Chairman"" and this book, Christian Gillette morphed from a cutthroat chairman looking to protect himself from other nefarious characters and cutthroats, a truly fascinating enigma - into a hero-for-everyman type of character. The book still kept me interested, but the series' high note was the 1st book, and the overall quality of the story has descended steadily since. Hopefully, ""The Successor"" will reverse that trend."
2,The cassete tape is better and has all songs -the good ones,I puchased this cd- becuase I had the same title in cassete and my copy got old and worn out- so when I saw this I thought I can replace my old one. Well to my surpise the cd/dvd package is not good- it has some good favorites but too many new and bad songs. The dvd is short and has two good videos/the rest suck/ especially with the new band members- not the hot boys ones from earlier!!! Do not waste you money!!!
4,Porduct worked as stated,"The Pocket Talker arrived on time and in perfect condition. It performs well and it is the quality that I expected. I think it is a bit expensive but there is little out there in the market to help people that are hard of hearing that actually works that is not expensive. I bought this in combination with a Bluetooth transmitter to send to a Bluetooth headset. My mom wanted something that could help her hear that did not look like a hearing aid. She is always wearing her cell phone Bluetooth headset so this worked out well; the Pocket Talker can hang out in her purse. Those products that are sold to boost sound that look like a Bluetooth headset (sonic ear, etc.) do not really work adequately. It is a versatile product that works exactly how you would expect it to from the product documentation,"
1,GeForce is the gamers card?,"First of all the GeForce is a realy fast in 3D games, but that is all.You may experience a lot of problems until you start your favorite game. Mixed out textures or total crash is posible if you do not have the latest patches for the games. The quality of the TV out is the worst of all video cards I have ever seen, even if you are using the S-out conector.It is imposible to match the picture on the TV screen.The image is near to MPEG1 than to DVD. That is all, the GeForce is fast(very fast) but I prefer Voodoo 3 3000- it is a litle bit slower but is not so expensive an there is no problems at all."
2,"Lousy firewall, good router","I ordered this router so that my computers could share a cable modem and be protected by one firewall. If you are using this device as a router, its great. It took less then ten minutes for me to set it up and configure it with my cable modem and three computers. However, as a firewall it is utterly useless. There is viturally no documentation on configuring a firewall, the instructions suggest you go out and buy a book about firewall so that you can set this device up properly. Its definitely not worth the money."
5,This one actually works!,This router is the best works with anything and NetGear has a 5 year warrenty too! NetGear is what my whole network is based around and wouldnt use anyone else after useing linksys which was the absoutly worst hardware in the world.. NetGear makes great products!
1,Horrible,I wasn't going to write a review about it but I never read such a horrible fantasy book before.By end of the book (first one that is) there wasn't a single character that I was rooting for. Needless to say I never made it to the second book.
3,"Great story, uninspiring writing","While reading this book I was very distracted from the story by the authors stilted and forced language and grammatical errors. There were times it seemed she was writing for a very young audience, and times there was a ""romance novel"" style. Despite this however, I really enjoyed the story itself. By the end of the book the characters flesh out considerably from their two dimensional beginnings, and while there are some very predictable threads in the book, there are also some original takes on the epic fantasy-good vs. evil genre. I am anxiously awaiting the next book, in which I believe Ms. Douglass' writing will mature and present us with another installment in this fascinating story."
4,A realistic fantasy,"This was great! The characters show more complexity than is usual in fantasy. They grapple with questions we all face, and answer them as we do -- that is to say, not always well! I can hardly wait until the rest of the series is available."
1,Drivel,"Okay, so the plot wasn't bad, but the writer needs a new editor, someone to point out that too many ""sweet childs"" and ""dear ones"" can ruin a book. The style is very awkward. Friedman here.) But not bad enough not to finish the first one. (Or maybe it is just morbid curiosity...)Reads like a very young person's first attempt at a book with a really incompetent editor...can't believe Tor published this...and it is an insult to compare the writer to Terry Goodkind or David Eddings (back cover blurb), as both are excellent writers... Nice cover art, but a big disappointment!"
2,Not as good as the next two...,"This novel is a rocky start for an otherwise well-written fantasy series. I found the characters to lack depth, the dialogue to be incredibly cheesey, and the plot to be overly cliched.It is, however, the basis for the next two books where Douglass truly shines. The characters become vastly more intruiging, the relationships between them are both surprising in their intricacies and in their dynamics.If you are looking for a good fantasy BOOK, look elsewhere; if it is a SERIES you're after, suffer through this book, and come to love Tencendor in the second and third installments."
2,Uggh,"This book was written poorly. There, I've said it. The first half of the book has enough of an intriguing plot, that kept me going. But it slowly faded away and all that was left was more poor writing. The plot wasn't good enough for me to read the next books in the trilogy. I confess that I sort of bought this book by the sexy cover. My biggest pet peeve is all of the BIG word naming. Why does everything have to have a long, BIG worded, confusing name - it makes it difficult to keep track of and severely interferes with the plot. In the end, the plot gave it one more star than it needs."
5,Relief,A friend gave me this to try. I was skeptical since i have had neck pain forever. I was very surprized at how effective it has been in reducing my pain and relaxing my neck and shoulders.
5,vatican II,Reliving the time of Vatican II and enjoying it. Taking a class at church to tryand help us all figure out the changes in the church and how we can bring backsome good old tradiions...VBronga
5,I can't believe it worked so well!,.... It was easy to setup and I was amazed that after 15 minutes I could sit on my back patio with a laptop and surf away. Great job LinkSys!
3,"Range is good, performance varies","Although this isn't a long range router the signal reaches through my walls and into another room. Setup was okay but the network password was almost impossible to decipher. There were 2 lines of numbers and letters, plus it was hard to differentiate the letter 'o' with zero. I didn't see a good way to change the password options. It may be there but I couldn't find it within the menus nor help section.The signal goes on and off and I had to keep figuring out if it was the DSL failing or the router. Many times I reset the router and the signal came back. There were very few times I had to reset the modem so I'm think the router is the culprit. This also includes some direct router connections, not just the wireless signal. It is at the low end of the price range but maybe I got a lemon."
1,"If the router doesn't work, you are out of luck","I bought this router in October 2003, and still have not gotten it to work wirelessly. The box did not include the installation CD, and I was told by Linksys that I could BUY one if I wanted. I have emailed, faxed, wrote, and of course called, with no help. I have asked for an RMA, and was told ""I think that has something to do with returning the product"". Linksys tech support is terrible. Buy at your own risk."
3,"Good product, Awful setup",I don't have any problem with the router. It took me several days and four calls to customer service to get it working. It was the fourth customer service rep. who was able to tell me how to set up the options so it would work. Setup was _extremely_ tedious and difficult. I never could have done it on my own and I'm a sophisticated computer user.
4,Works good when you get it working....,"Had 2 people working on the router for over 10hours setting it up. Called techs support several times, and like others have said, you only get told to go to the webpage. Turns out our settings were right all along, but after applying the firmware update it just worked perfectly.... Argg, the tech support should have suggested this in the first place!!!!!!!"
2,very complicated product,I am personally not so familiar with computers but it should not be so difficult to hook up a wireless router and I had a lot of trouble with this. But once I got it together it worked great.
3,Not for Windows Me!,"With Windows XP the router does what you would expect. However, remember you wanted wireless, so don't complain about signal strength when you're 100 feet away from the router. If you have Windows Me you will most likely be as unhappy as I was after connecting the router. The internet may work temporarily, but the entire computer will lock-up during each use. Also, if you need customer support to assist you with your router then you had better get a different brand because Linksys could not offer worse support for there router."
3,Not good for online gaming,"The router works great...EXCEPT... several times a day the connection gets interrupted, just long enough to disconnect online games. I had to go back to using my netgear switch.Very disappointing."
5,Excelente!!!,"Al principio tuve problemas para configurar el Router, pero esra solo custion de seguir las indications y cuando se conecta el Cable Modem al Router y no se puede obtener una IP del router, presionar el boton de ""Reset"" que se encuatra detras del Router y listo!!! Funciona!!! excelente, depues de esto e conectado mi portatil y mi PS2 y comparta lo conexión por todo la casa"
2,Stay away from this router.,"Yesterday, I bought Linksys WRT54G. But, right now, I am using my old wired SMC router to write this review. Why? SINCE Linksys WRT54G. ONLY PARTIALLY WORKS!!! I could only use Linksys WRT54G to access some websites successfully (Cnet, yahoo...), but I could not access Ebay, Amazon. I called tech support today, they said I should not upgrade the latest Firmware Version: 2.04.4 which had some bugs and he would email the previous version, let me install it to rid these accessing problems. I have not received an email from tech support, so, now I am not sure whether the old firmware will work or not. I am frustrated; I don't expect Linksys does not fully test its firmware before releasing it. I am thinking to cling to SMC product again, and return this BAD product to Linksys. I have no problem now using this now, after exchanging a new one. DON¡T TOUCH THE FIRMWARE, IF YOUR DEVICE IS WORKING FINE."
1,Piece of junk Do Not Buy! Only Half of functions work!,"Funny how amazon.com hid the bad reviews which are true about this router. There is no UPnP and Port Trigering, The DMZ option does not work, port forwarding does not work,And funny, Linksys confirmed all these problems when I called them. Linksys support has no clue about supporting these. I had to get to A Level 2 manager for support. These are overpriced for what functions on them. Half the functions dont work on it, there is nothing good to say but its junk."
1,Unstable unusable junk - AVOID!,"If you enjoy interrupting your surfing to unplug and plug back in the router every 10 minutes, this is your product.I might have thought this was just some problem with my network or my unit if I hadn't read the same issues all over the internet. I can't believe they ship this junk. Linksys is off my list of vendors."
2,"Came used, worked fine for two days, and now...","Be advised, you might get a used product, full of dust, dirt, and a cd-rom full of scratches. I was pretty ticked off at first, seeing as I paid for what I would naturally think would be a new unit, not something that has obviously sat on someone else's desk before and was returned for who-knows-why. But it was to complete a gift that I had purchased elsewhere and so I gave it a try anyway, only to happily discover that it did work (although it took a little coaxing to get the scratched up disk to run in my drive) and was actually very simple to set up. So the moral of my story? Buy this product, but just do it somewhere else where you know you'll be able to get one that's new and not used for the same price.UPDATED REVIEW NOTE: So this router is now causing my internet to drag slower than dial up, and only after two days! I will be returning this piece of garbage to Amazon and expecting a full refund. Buyer beware!!!"
3,It works.,"A competent router, but I want an easy (or any) interface to reserve specific IP addresses for devices on my home network. Port forwarding is a pain when the device addresses change over time.Maybe this does, but I can't find it in the byzantine interface."
3,wireless in SF,"Generaly speaking I am very happy with this unit, but I have had problems with the base unit and my 2.4 ghz cordless phone. Within the first month, I have had to restart and reprogram my base unit twice. I have since killed my phone and have not had any problems since. The range is good, I can access within my house, deck and yard. I have not tried going to my neighbor's house, but I would probably be able to get service there too."
1,The most horrible wireless router I have ever had.,"Every other day I am disconnected from the internet. The reason? No, reason. The real reason is the Linksys not linking. You can change Linksys's the Customer center name to hell Center. -5 Stars"
1,Very disappointing!,I bought this because Linksys was the best and easiest to install. Nothing but a pain in my butt week signal and my computer is literally only 20 feet away they say thick wall affect it but I dont think they are that thick. Signal is always week I try to move it try to adjust the settings but nothing. It was not worth the money I hope newer versions are better I may not buy another one of there products after this.
4,Good WPA Router,"I purchased WRT54G earlier this year and used it for about six months before giving it to my brother (I got myself WRTSL54G because of the storage option). The main reason I chose this router was that it supports WPA. It was easy to setup and the wireless coverage was pretty good. The only thing I had to configure was wireless SSID and WPA shared key. Other than that, all I needed was to plug Cablevision's cable modem to the Internet port and my computer to one of the four LAN ports. The WPA worked well with my Dell and HP laptops (WPA performance was better compared to WEP).The main problem I had was that the wireless would freeze every once in a while and a reboot was needed to 'unfreeze' it. This is why I am giving it four stars."
1,Broken,"Some versions of the firmware don't play World of Warcraft - miscalculates the checksum for a particular packet, leading to the game being a 'ghost town'. Consistently, well documented among many owners. Google this before buying it, I had to throw mine away."
1,Would Not Buy any LInksys Product,"I have had the WRT54G and a Linksys wirelass adapter for a year or so. I would not advise buying any Linksys product because the technical support is awful.Unless you are an expert, you will probably need help from tech support sooner or later. My experiences with tech support have been uniformly bad.I have a simple system, two Win XP computers, a router, and a wireless adapter.Yet, the support people seem unable to solve common problems. When they can't, the blame your ISP, modem, Windows, or whatever. There is no way to get connected to a higher level person."
3,Linksys WRT54G Wireless-G Router,"Some times it loses the wireless connection, may be it is only my router and in this case I always make the reconnection"
2,Burnt out fast,"Reception was excellent, but in less than a year I had to purchase a replacement. Not recommended."
2,"Fine for wired, practically useless for wireless","So, I have owned this product for 2 months, and in those two months, the wireless has regularly cut out for no reason for about 4 to 6 seconds every 5 minutes or so. This is enough of a timeout to cause ssh sessions to die and streaming video to halt. So, I updated the firmware, changed the broadcast channel, altered the encryption. None of that solved anything. I tested the product on the floor 3 inches from my laptop...same problem. I called linksys support, and they told me to raise it up a foot...why the wireless can't reach 3 inches, I don't know, but I did it, on a stack of books. Problem persisted. The tech support representative had no other useful information, telling me it was probably something environmental. I highly doubt this to be the case, since I see this problem is quite frequent. If you plan to use wireless, I truly can't recommend this product."
1,Piece of junk,"Let me be blunt, this is a piece of junk. I run a computer repair business and I've had many jobs whereby I had to fix this specific router. I've made a lot of money fixing people WiFi due to this router. If you are using a wired connection, you'll be fine. But the wireless network is going to fail you at some time. Here is how you fix it. From a WIRED connection, access the router and backup your settings. Do a factory reset. Then do restore your backup settings. It will then work again. Of course, you can avoid this hassle by looking somewhere else for a router.In general, you should avoid any and all low-end Linksys products. However, the pricier Linksys products, such as the WRT54GL (the one with L at the end) is a quality router. But this one is junk worthy only of your trash can."
4,Reliable Service,"The setup was difficult with my Westell 6100 modem from Verizon at first but when I set it up everything works weel. Also is works well with the quite a large distance, the other computer picks it up well even witgh the door closed and both computers using the internet at the same time."
2,Save your money and buy something else.,"The main problem with this router is that the connection inexplicably drops. When this happens, you have to go through some ridiculous ritual to try and get your signal back. Sometimes unplugging the router for a few seconds does the trick. Sometimes restarting your computer does it. Sometimes disabling the wireless connection and reenabling it fixes the problem. And other times, you have to waste 1-2 hours talking with technical support. The online setup/admin screen is also difficult to use because the passwords keep resetting. When this router is working without any hassles, it is a decent product. But because of its lack of reliability, I honestly cannot recommend it. The time wasted trying to reestablish a lost connection makes this purchase more trouble than it's worth."
1,Don't Buy It - Ver 5 is Broken,"I've been using Linksys 802.11b routers/access points for years and was very happy. I should've read the reviews here first before getting the wrt54g!It hangs frequently and needs to be power cycled. 5 times yesterday, during 5 hours of use.Tech support gave some suggestions - firmware update, change MTU, and hard reset. None changed a thing.It's a Ver 5. I hope everyone at Cisco who had a say in releasing this is fired."
2,Read teh Linksys Documentation carefully,"The router works OK as a router, but their port forwarding system did not meet my expectations. What they call ""port forwarding"" in their documentation means that you can't forward a message on a router port to a different port on an internal IP address. I wanted to forward port 991 to port 80 on one IP address and port 992 to port 80 on a different computer. Their documentation seemed to say the unit would do that, but it won't. It insists on having the same inbound port number and forwarded port number.They have a device which will do what I want, but it costs 3 times as much.Read the documentation carefully before buying their unit.That's not Amazon's fault, they didn't write the documentation."
3,Get the WRT54GL instead,"I'm glad I read the reviews that told me to get the Linksys WRT54GL instead of this model. After version 4 of the WRT54G, Linksys is using a different OS and have downgraded their flash and RAM memory by half of what they used to have. Normally, a higher version implies a better product, but in this case, the opposite has happened.If you are wondering why some reviews are so bad and some are good, the version number may be one factor.Get the WRT54GL, which is what WRT54G is supposed to be. Then if you want, you can flash the firmware to a much better third-party like DD-WRT."
3,router,I have so many issues with using this router for my wireless laptop.Every week I need to reconnect it wireline to the network in order to have it keep working wirelessly. Linksys stated that this needs to be done only once but it really needs to be done all the time.I believe the issue is due to the fact I set it a secured network.
2,Costly Support!,"I have had my Linksys router for 3 years. I also had to get a bridge to extend the range because it couldn't go through walls very well. They used to have free support until just recently. I had to call them a lot because sometimes the bridge or router somehow lost the address.My beef is with the cost of support. 3.99 a minute. ( I don't know if that includes listening for several minutes to bad music.) You can get 3 months support for $199, 6 months for $299 or 1 year for $499!!! I can tell you I spent many hours talking to tech support so I would go elsewhere."
4,"good, but can be better","first one i bought was defective. out of the box, the power led kept blinking. read a few forums and found out that a firmware upgrade is needed. i thought this didn't make sense as new products should work immediately. anyways, i decided to return the product and asked for a replacement. the second one was a lot better. it worked as soon as i've got the cables connected. signal strength was good and i haven't had any connection dropped. one issue though is i can't vpn to office network. again, read forums and found out that this is an outstanding issue. waiting for a firmware update that will fix this. overall, it's a good replacement for my old usr 5461 router which kept dropping connections."
1,"Decent router, terrible customer service","I recently purchased the Linksys router and have now spent the better part of 2 days attempting to get it to work with my laptop. I do not consider myself to be a real techie but have spent the last 5 years working in IT and usually have no problem. Unfortunately for me, I ran into problems setting up the router with my T1 line and routing it wirelessly to a Centrino IBM laptop.My experience with Linksys tech support was one of the worst experiences I have had. The reps were dificult to understand and their knowledge of the technology was severely lacking. In addition, on multiple occasions, the reps would hang up when the troubleshooting reached a dead end.Only advice: Hope your installation is flawless. Because if you run into any remotely complex problems, you may end up spending days trying to resolve it."
3,Good price but range is not very good,My old Buffalo wireless router died and I bought this as a replacement. Setting the unit and network was very easy.I am not happy with its service range. At first I placed it where old one was but I could get signal on my laptop in a bedroom. I needed to place much closer to the bedroom.
2,I've seen three of these fail so far,"I do some basic network consulting on the side, and have seen three WRT54G routers fail so far. One was mine, two were customers'. Of the ten or so that I've worked with, thats around a 30% failure rate. Not so good. When they work, they're great. The failures generally came after power outages, so it's likely to do with the power supply and/or conditioning in the power circuit in the router. In any event, I have not seen this failure rate in the D-Link, Netgear or Buffalo routers that I have worked with."
4,"Works well, but...","This wireless router functions very well AFTER you get it set up. The self install format did not work with my broadband provider and required a rather lengthy phone call to customer support, who admitted that the CD installation process rarely succeeded! It would appear that Linksys needs to update its installation software as well as provide more documentation other than just a single page of instructions."
2,buy the GS instead,With the GS you'll get MORE processing power and more ram so you can use cooler Sveasoft firmwares.
4,Reset it!,"I received the Router with this great price ...Turned it on after pluging the AC Adapter ...plugging the two antennas ....I found the an ((NEW)) Encryoted wireless network on the list!No password sent by the vendor ...I searched for how to RESET this thing to factory default and found thisPush the resent butten at the back with a pen or a key for 30 seconds.I tried this for 3 time and it succeeded to reset it.I got a special CD for setup but this cd WILL NOT rescue you from being encrypted unless U lisen to me and reset it the way I did.After that you can encrypt it and change the network name by loging to192.168.1.1 Name: ((leave it blank))and the default password is ""admin""...I used closed-set of MAC addresses to encrypt...other method didn't work with my laptop and this is usual for many reasons!Away from this issue it is great price and reached so fast ... compatible with linux too"
1,Just won't communicate,"I decided to go from my netgear router to the wrt54g and nightmares began. Can't get past installation on my XP Pro box. Changed cables etc to no avail. Desktop talks to box but after that I get ""you have no Internet connection"" or something like that. and never get any further. CD installation got me the same message. My ISP is bellsouth.net and uses ppoe. I have only the RJ-45 cable from the wall for DSL and no modem is required. With the NetGear router I just plugged in the line from wall to the inet port on the router connected the router to the with a standard dsl cable desktop for the setup and away I went. 5 minutes to add my wireless notebook and a few more minutes for WEP and MAC setup and away it went."
2,Incompatibiltiy problems,"I bought the WRT54G wireless router to connect to my new Compaq Evo laptop with a Multiport 802.11b. I couldn't get the wireless connection to work at all until I downloaded the firmware update of 1/29/03. Now I have a connection, but every time I try to enable WEP encryption or disable SSID broadacst, I lose the wireless connection. I am also not able to share files and printers. After several calls and e-mails Linksys finally said that non-linksys wireless network devices have not yet been tested with the WRT54G. I am going to return this and try another router."
1,A big step backwards,"I bought this unit to replace an aging Microsoft Home Networking wireless router (802.11b). Much to my surprise, the wired connection was about 10% slower with the Linksys unit installed. The wireless connection was slightly slower (about 5%) and the range was only slightly better than the old unit. Given all the above, back it goes to Amazon."
1,"Avoid WRT54G it has be ""re-engineered""","If you are lucky enough to own an earlier model, then you no doubt feel it's a great product, and it was. That was before Cisco decided to ""re-engineer"" it and turn it into a pancake.WiFi router, hardly. I had one that worked for about a week. Then the speed dropped off to 125K and went even farther down from there.It was exchanged for one that lasted almost two months. It also dropped and dropped in speed until a tin-can-and-string would have been better.The third unit was dead right out of the box!Version 8.X is the re-engineered fiasco. Version 4.0 was the best.If you can't get a version 4, avoid this Cisco farce. They re-engineered it, let them keep it."
2,Don't do what I did!!,When I was thinking about buying this.It was to hook up a Windows Me for my 7 yr. old Autistic nephew.He enjoys the screensavers so much!!Another family member was over and brought a new laptop.We hooked up everything and found that the only way this will work is only one at a time can be used.It totally zapped all the speed of my home computer.So if you buy this be forewarned.One at a time.
1,WRT54G v5 Warning,"NO 3rd Party Firmware exists for this model. The problem is the amount of RAM (2/8Mb) and the OS is VxWorks and not Linux.The version Amazon shipping is v5. If you want to use 3rd Party Firmwares, DO NOT BUY A WRT54G v5.To find out which WRT54G you are buying look at the serial number on the box. If it starts with CDFB then it is a v5.For the others who don't use custom firmwares, be aware that v5 is running on a new platform with new firmware (rev 1.00.00 as of Oct 2005) so problems may arise."
5,Linksys WRT54G Wireless-G Router,bought this wireless router to set up a wireless network in my apartment. so me and my mates can access highspeed broadband..and package arrived on time as mentioned by amazon..and setting up was easy and the signal was terrific in all the rooms..so i would greatly recomend this product...for those who dont want to spend much on wireless router..and get best quality....
2,Backwards compatibility is a joke,"CNet reviewed it and found that, if you had any 802.11b clients, the access point forced everybody into 802.11b mode. I'm not touching this puppy until it can have b and g running simultaneously (just like having 10Mbps and 100Mbps devices hooked up to the same Ethernet switch). It ought to be possible, after all, even if it has to run them on separate radio channels."
1,"Tempermental, Unreliable","This is my 2nd Linksys router. Totally a frustration in the 2 months that I have owned it. If there is a power glitch, I'm crawling around on the floor shutting down the modem, router, switching cables, etc. to get my router to grab the IP.If that doesn't work, I'm on the phone w/ Linksys support. I have had to update the firmware twice.I will NEVER buy Linksys again. They do not seem the same in reliability since CISCO bought them. Glad I sold my CISCO stock!"
1,"Awful, just awful",Almost constant disconnection problems with the wireless connecting with two MacBooks and a Nintendo DS. Judging from the other reviews this router is really hit and miss with the manufacturing. There's a direct correlation between price and quality with wireless routers. Don't get something cheap.I upgraded to a AirPort Express base station and all of the issues went away.
1,Hangs every 5 min,"please save your money, this router worked fine for 2 month, now it hangs after just 5 min."
5,A Great Product!!!,"This router is one of the best on the market today, i have done some research on the net and found that this is one of the more cheaper wireless routers! It is only a good $$$ but it has great speed! When i first opened the box i was so excited to put it together to see how it would work. Well to make the long story short I did what the instructions told me to do and it was very easy to do! Then after all that (took maybe 10 min.) it worked! I hope you take some time to look at this new linksys wireless G router, i think after you use it you will love it! Good luck to all who want a good deal and a great product, buy it!"
1,Beware,"I bought this because of the reputation of the WRT54G, not realizing that v5 of the hardware is completely different from the older versions and doesn't run Linux. Even with the latest firmware, it is consistently unstable and will lock up and stop functioning every few days. I'd advise voting with your wallet and staying away from the WRT54G v5, and thinking about a WRT54GL which is the ""classic"" version of the hardware that runs Linux. Unfortunately, this seems to be more limited in availability than the cut-down version."
5,Linksys router,The 54G wireless router works exactly as advertised. Has good range and is easy to use.
5,Worked perfectly,"Having failed with a different brand I thought I would try this. With a couple of calls to Tech Support, which were very productive, I managed to get the wireless network going. I am concerned that the level of security recommended was not what other reviews/forum have recommended. Perhaps the techie did not want to complicate matters for me."
3,good as long as it lasts,"OK I had 2-month happy experience with this router. Under intensive usage, it never losts connection, never resets. With the newest firmware, the b devices and g devices work together very well. I can at least hit 1.6MByte/s throughput on my g devices when b devices are working too. 128bit WEP works well with my multiple devices, a wireless-g laptop and a 802.11b PDAthe bad: After 2 months, the router is dead. The Diag red light is solid on. Reset, no response. Try to re-flash the firmware, no luck since ethernet is down. Now I have to pay shipping by myself and get a replacement. Who knows how long the replacement will work..."
3,works great after the install,"After a 3 day battle to get the router installed it worked wonders. I didn't realize that the router only had a Ethernet connection and not a usb. I had to buy a Ethernet usb adapter to be able to get it to work with my computer. After I thought it had been installed i ran the software but it refused to detect the internet, then refused to detect the router. In the end I had to call my cable company to reprogram my modem over the phone so it would work. Overall, I am very happy with the way this router works, it has a strong signal and allows me to work at the levels I would expect from a wired connection. The downside was the installation, though generally find Linksys to be difficult in that aspect."
4,After firmware update very nice router,"If you get the latest version 5, then be sure to update to the latest firmware 1.00.4 (previous versions were buggy and caused slow downs). This is my second Linksys router and I am very pleased with its performance for Wireless G and wired. While some here are complaining that the new version doesn't run on Linux, this isn't an issue unless you plan to run third party firmware. The router is very good, especially at this low price point."
3,"Good Product, cruddy service","The tech support for Lynksys is not very good. They don't know a whole lot about operating systems, or anything about apple computers. The router works great, but it took me 4 hours to figure out how to set it up with a mac."
1,Require manual reboot every few minutes,"This is really a piece of junk. Over the last 5 years I have used at least 3 Linksys wireless routers. The first one was working OK then suddenly its wireless part stopped functioning so I had to buy a second one. Just like another Amazon user said in his review. This router only support wired connections. Whenever I connect my MacBook to it wirelessly, sometimes in seconds most often in a few minutes the router just freezes up, all my PC's connected to it will lose internet connection. The only way to get out of this is to do a manual restart. Yes I updated firmware, but it doesn't help."
1,ANOTHER POS ROUTER # 2 FOR ME.,"I THOUGHT IT WAS MY COMPUTER, CABLE PROVIDER OR ME. BUT NOOOOOOO !!!!!!!IT WAS THIS PIECE OF GARBAGE ROUTER THAT KILLED MY INTERNET CONNECTION.IF YOU HAVE A MAC, BUY AIRPORT WHICH I WILL BE BUYING. THIS WILL BE MY THIRD ROUTER. STAY FAR FAR FAR AWAY FROM LINKSYS AND NETGEAR ROUTERS."
5,Great SOHO network device,"This product is easily the best ""swiss army knife"" for home and small office networking. Easy to configure, although the default configuration pretty much covers most installations. I've used it with both cable and DSL WAN connections. Functions great as a router or just a simple 4 port switch and wireless access point. Excellent value from a manufacturer with a great pedigree."
1,"Wireless consistently drops, slow internet (for cable)","This is the second one of these I've had the (dis)pleasure of working with. Fortunately I only bought the first one...1) Wireless stops working 1-2 times a week. Sometimes power cycling works, sometimes resetting from scratch works. Sometimes neither works. However it might be overheating... I just put it in the freezer since I noticed it was warm and its back working... When you ping the router when it starts misbehaving it times out or gets responses like 768ms. Plugging directly into the router when it acts like this works, but what's the point?2) Internet access is consistently slower than everywhere else and we have cable.I have installed the latest BIOS update for this thing. My roomates get feisty when they cant get on the internet and I am an IT professional.. hehehe. They are starting to doubt my skills!At this rate Im thinking of going back to dialup. I got a spare 1200 baud modem floating around here..."
4,finally it works well,It was disappointing at first when I had to return my unit as an RMA and spend $7.00 for shipping. I received a replacement and it works very well. I think the default firmware is what causes all the troubles. An advise I can recommend to boost the signal strength is try to experiment the Channels from 1 to 11.
1,This router version is FAULTY,"This is my first wireless router purchase and it is a piece of crap. The easy CD install didn't work. I spoke with 3 tech support people, spending almost 2 hours on phone plugging and unplugging the thing - and going over the same instructions from them to have the final supervisor apologize that v. 5 of this router has been known to have many problems and be faulty! My options were to return and buy v.4 instead or download some software from the internet that 'might help fix it'. I see recently I""m not the only one with such problems. So be very careful and DON""T purchase this version. I don't know what to try next, as I'm not a techie geek - Very unhappy!"
1,Frequent drops in service,"The setup was no problem. Anyone with even a small bit of network experience can figure this one out.The problem here is frequent drops in service - as often as every 30 seconds. I have no problems when wired directly to this unit. However, I run two wireless laptops and both have frequent issues with disconnections. One of the systems rarely reconnects without a reboot of the router.I have never had problems with Linksys in the past, however this product has led me to question the quality that is being produced. After numerous emails to technical support in trying to resolve this issue, they have stopped responding. My recommendation is to look at another manufacturer."
1,Version 5 is garbage,Seems like Linksys / Cisco is scrimping on the parts... This thing is unstable at best... Get a WRT54GS or a WRT54G v4 or lower...
1,Experienced Problem on my desk-top PC,"According to my server's technician, the product had a faulty DHCP, which caused problems with my desk-top PC system. He questioned whether the product was a new or re-conditioned item. I thought I ordered a new product. In any case, I returned it to Amazon for a refund."
4,Great but beware of concrete walls..,"My apartment has concrete walls, and It seems that If you have to cross more than two walls, the signal deteriorates to about 10 to 15% with some interruptions. So be prepared to re-cable your house in order to place the router at an appropriate place.Other than that, the installation is quite easy."
3,wireless,"Works fine but it took the Geek Squad to install so be careful of the ""just press here to install"" in the promotion material."
4,good router but....,"the only issue I have is that I bought this router to be able to swamp the antennas for larger ones and this model does not support that, although older version of the WRT54G do. Linksys and the seller should make it clear that this feature is not available."
2,not easy to set up and difficult to keep running,"I bought this router becasue it was supposed to be the best, everybody used them. I bought mine and the set up was a nightmare. Then for no reason it would just stop sending a signal. Tried to reset and it would ask for a security code, I specifically avoiding setting one! Calls to the company, and 2 computer geeks coming over to tinker with it never got it fixed. Bought a Belkin on sale and set up was a breeze and has worked ever since."
4,Pretty decent router for the price,"Does its job. It's pretty easy to configure. Setting up the security and firewall is a breeze. The only problem I have is that it occasionally craps out on me, but mostly when traffic gets pretty high on the network."
1,Junk,I bought a v5 of this and it is terrible. It stops working a lot for no reason.Spend the extra $20 and get the WRT54GL. That model runs on linux and has more memory. You can also flash and put DD-WRT on it.
3,"not bad, but not too great either","i have had this router long enough to know that it has problems with overheating. they can be solved by mounting (or simply placing) an 80mm computer case fan to the top of it, but thats not the end of this thing's problems. they were trying to save money making the more recent (V5+) routers of this model and it has been stripped to a minimal amount of RAM and Flash Space, making it unsuitable for aftermarket modification. i'm gonna bite the bullet here soon and get a WRT54GL, which is the same a the V4 version in most respects."
3,VPN Users Beware,This isn't a bad router but if you are planning to use it to access via VPN (to access an account at work for example) using a wireless card you are out of luck (for now). There is a known issue with this router it seems. It wil not work with a wireless card to access your VPN network (hard-wire WILL work). I opened a ticket with Linksys tech support but I don't have a fix yet.
1,Don't buy this product,I purchased this router from Amazon. After four calls to India and two lost weekends I returned it to Amazon as the router was unable to recognize my Verizon DSL modem. I believe the router was defective but since Linksys tech support knew less about it than I did I can't be sure. I have since bought a router from Verizon which works very well. Unless you are an IT professional don't buy this product. BTW to add insult to injury Amazon deducted return shipping from my refund. Let's hope they didn't restock this item for the next poor customer.
5,"Easy setup, reliable performance, A+!","I've noticed that all the people who have had problems with this device are the people who seem like they know what they're talking about as opposed to the regular casual users who have limited or no technical knowledge and also have no problems with their routers. I'm a total Wi-Fi nube, yet I got this router set up with the 128-bit WEP encryption in about five minutes, right out of the box. It's connected to the main computer downstairs, and I had no problems getting it to work with my Thinkpad, which I noticed some other people had complained about compatability between the two. I have had this router for several weeks now with absolutely no problems, no signal dropouts, and no interference with my cordless phone. The signal strength is great, and setup was a breeze. I highly recommend this product for anyone, even if you don't use any of the advanced settings it's a great buy."
2,Inconsistent; Constantly failing for no apparently reason,"I wouldn't recommend this router unless you enjoy spending lots of time talking to customer support representatives. In fairness, they usually can resolve the problem, but then I'm back on the phone with them again two weeks later. Save yourself the trouble and find a router that actually works."
2,If you plan to game online do not buy this product (PC),"If you're just surfing it's great, if you plan to online game with your PC this does not, and cannot be made to work. You will get booted and it shut down the whole network within seconds. After which you will be required to do a complete re-install and set up. I wasted many hours on the phone with tech support trying to figure this out.However this is my fault & not the Linksys product. I should have done the research before purchasing. I guess that is why they make gaming routers!"
1,Good router.,"I got it working fast enough. It is a nice router in all ways but one. It is not reliable.A couple of times a week it seems to cease access to the internet. That is, you cannot access the internet at all. All lights blink, and you can still access other computers on wired and wireless LAN. Just no internet. You have to unplug the unit to get it to work again. Very annoying.I did know about this from researching on the internet before purchasing it, but I bought it anyway. My mistake.I have returned it and have a cheaper, nicer Belkin.************ Update on review.Other brands were not so hot. I got another Linksys and updated it with latest firmware. Problems went away. Have used it for many months now no problem."
5,Works great...,For the price this product is GREAT! If you want to really play you can even download an open source version of the BIOS and play with programming new options (I have even ran an open source version of Linux on the router's internal memory). COOL!
1,Died After 5 Months,"The router died after only 5 months of use. My previous wireless router (Netgear) lasted 5 years. The software that comes with the router (Linksys Advisor) was quite buggy. It reported, on the average, once a month that a new ""phantom"" device was attached to the network. I am very disappointed with this product."
2,Not a technical product,The product was delivered in time and this is the only positive issue.The lenscope switch was defective and the bulbs beam was partial obstructed by the cover of the batery. After inserting the bateries the cover remained lifted.As atotal the product is of low quality manufacture.I am a profesional and the lenscope was intended for my work (Materials engineering ). It works as a magnifier but for the price I was expectinga better quality .
3,A Good Start,"""A Good Start"" can be taken two ways. There is plenty of information here to get you started finding interesting, music related sites on the web. One site leads to the next, and so the book provides a valuable service, as a good start.On the other hand, it's only a start. It's a huge web out there and this book just begins to scratch the surface.The format and layout is good - the screenshots of the home pages make for interesting browsing through the book. The descriptions are to the point, but offer enough information for you to decide whether or not a particular site would be interesting to you.As I've never heard of any other book like this one, it's easy to say that this is the best book available to begin exploring websites of interest to musicians."
2,Dissapointed,"I am a Michael Ball fan tried and true but I think that this album is well below his high standard. I am not against the concept of a soft voiced Michael this time around but many of the songs are sung way too slow and are just plain boring. This Guy's In Love With You was typical of a great song that just lost character on this album. The finale of Me and My Shadow with Antonio was great but it has already been done, just as well, by Robbie Williams and others. ALAN (AUSTRALIA)"
2,Love this band but not this record,i did not like this work for a number of reasons. The first thing i hated was the sound. Too much echo or reverb. Unlike past albums were the sound was up-close and warm. The other thing i noticed was the poor attention to structure of songs. Most of these songs sound like rock improvisations . Obviously some were taken and worked into more structured songs but they all have this 'jam' feeling to them.Also the aproach is more in the late Hammill compositional style than what we've come to know as the VDGG style.Of course this is my opinion but if you compare this to any of the best works from the past you will know what i am talking about.
4,Where's the Beef?,"For such a delightfully wonderful show, I cannot believe how they skimped on the DVD collection! First the good news. This collection has all the first season shows complete with a quick recap of each episode (like you see on your local tv stations each evening).It also has a couple of actor interviews. And that's about it. No extra vocal tracks of the actors/producers giving you behind the scenes info. No witty cut scenes. No animated selection screens. Not even a bloopers reel. But hey...the box talks! At least a couple of times and then sadly...it also stops working.To end this review on a good note; the shows are still great and I am sure that there is NO way they could make ""Season 2"" any worse in it's presentation. Let's hope not anyways."
2,"Fun episodes, but Mill Creek video terrible","I picked this up for $4.99 from a DVD bin and thought it would be a cheap way to have the first season. I am not grading the older, higher-priced release issued by the studio, but this newer one from Mill Creek. The video transfer is as cheap as the price, and that is unfortunate. The image is grainy (in a bad way)."
3,Art of Super Guitaring!!!,"This is a DVD for guys who have already been on the guiatr for sometime and want to improvise on techniques.The DVD can help a good guitarist get better by alaysing and helping on a few guiatr techniques that Eric johnson emphasizes on .on the Negativess, Its a bit complicated as the Exercises in the DVD arent well explained in terms of the scales that are played or the definition in terms of Roots, Also that they are fast and a new guitarist cant use it to learn anythin as he wont understand much.Aaron Pereiramumbai"
5,cool,"""Some items didn't come w/the screws included, and since some others did, I don't know if I'm missing them or they just weren't supposed to be included in the first place. But nothing a quick trip to the hardware store can't fix. Bottom line, they look great, they were well wrapped and arrived in one piece. I'm pleased overall."""
3,Helpful,"I use this at work in a medical office and I am happy with it. The drawback for me is that if there is more than a couple of seconds of silence, the battery saving device kicks in and shuts it off. Then I can't hear anything. I shake it around to create some noise and it turns back on again. Sometimes I miss a few words of what the patient is saying and that is a problem. It connects and disconnects easily without other employees having to bother with it (a big step up from the amplifying cap that fit on the ear piece.) This is a good product and I would use it at home if I had a chorded phone."
4,Pretty good quality,This is a good quality set of horseshoes. I've used them several times now and my only complaint is that the paint is chipping off a lil but I guess that is to be expected when metal hits metal.
4,popular lawn game.,I bought set to use for family reunion and it was used extensively. My only reservation for not rating it a 5 is due to the scuffing of the covering paint to make some abrasiveness to throwing the shoes. This happened rather quickly.
4,A Pretty Good Toy,"This toy is pretty good most of the time. I like the way the water squirts out and you can control the direction of the cars after they're washed. I've had this carwash for at least 3 years and it still works, although the bubbles sometimes come out of the wrong place now. If you have a sandbox you need to keep the sand out of the fan!!"
4,Nephew loves it!,"I was concerned about all the water/mess involved with this toy, but my 2 1/2 year old nephew loves to take this in the bathtub with him every evening and play with it during his bath. When he is not bathing, he and his older brother will put it on a towel and play with it together. They also play with it using just the hot wheels - no water - and enjoy that as well. Thier mom thinks it's great!!! I HIGHLY recommend this toy for busy boys with hot wheels. Buy with confidence!"
3,Wireless card,I liked it very much. I don't like the requiement the I need to have a number of words to complete this review. Pain in the but.
3,Didn't fit my laptop,"Does not fit the slots in my Vaio laptop, be careful of dimensions when ordering. Did, however, arrive on time and undamaged."
2,INSTALLATION NIGHTMARE,"Router installed in a snap. Not the WPC54G card. After installing the driver on my Presario 17xl370 notebook with W2K, the card was shown as Inactive. Calling Linksys support was a complete waste of time. The only thing they are good at is telling you to re-install the driver and putting you on hold for ever! Re-installing the driver didn't help, and I tried, OK about 5 times. Before returning the card back to Amazon, I decided to re-install the whole W2K system. At one point, I was close to throwing everything out through a closed window. Anyway, my effort paid off and I made the card work.I am happy with it now, the speed and range is great. I wouldn't however recommend the card to anybody before Linksys does something with the driver. If you can wait, don't buy it now."
4,love being wireless,I purchased this item because my parents just recently got DSL highspeed. I thought that i would use it while i'm away at college to help get my moneys worth out of it. I followed the instructions to a T and got the wireless card working. Keep in mind that I'm not a computer wiz kid. I did have one problem getting onto my schools network. The colleges network is really wierd. My card recognized that i was on the network but for some reason i couldn't get online. I ended up having to call RCC (Residental Computing Connection) here on campus to help me get online. After he worked with my computer for maybe 10 minutes i was online and surfing the net with very little noticable speed difference.
1,"Stay away from Linksys WPC54g,not for novice","I bought the Linksys wpc54g, this is a piece of garbage. If your laptop uses TI cardbus controllers, forget it, not compatable. If you have Win XP, you must not use the zero configuration utility, it can not use 128 bit wep encryption, and can only use AD-hoc mode. I returned this and bought a NetGear wireless card and BAM right out of the box it works great. Make sure your system is not incompatable before you buy, read what techies have to say about this linksys product."
3,mixed opinion,"The product I recieved works ok. Only problem I have is that it's an older model. Everything else, including the shipping was excellent."
2,Not plug and play.,"I bought this card with the hopes of an easy installation on my W2K notebook. Getting it to work with a non-Linksys wireless hub took several frustrating evenings. The documention that came with the device and on the Linksys web site was absolutely useless. The installation software had conflicts with the firewall software so I had to remove both the firewall and linksys software and reinstall the software. Getting the 128 bit WEP configuration to work required asking a consultant for help. Apparently, you must enter the long security code versus the network access password. This obscure nuance was not obviously noted in the manual or on line documentation. I'm sure it is a little more straight forward if your network is all one brand but getting this device to work in a mixed brand environment was difficult and I should have listened to the consultant and bought the NetGear card."
4,wireless freedom,"This wireless card has a good range, even thru walls - and maintains connection and speed without any problems."
1,You may save $50 or ...,"... you may just be throwing $20 plus shipping and hours of your time down a rat hole. I bought this adapter from Amazon last week. After installing it in my IBM Thinkpad laptop, I found that the laptop would no longer go into standby (sleep) with the adapter present. Further on-line investigation suggests that the Linksys driver does not properly implement Microsoft's NDIS driver standard in the area of device power control, and hence blocks the standby operation.Linksys' driver for this device was last updated over two years ago, although a search shows that numerous other purchasers of this device been have complained about the standby problem, as well as the ineffectiveness of Linksys customer service. As a retired Cisco exec, I am truly ashamed of the shoddy quality of this device software."
3,Linksys Wireless-G Notebook Adapter,I must have not understood install directions etc. or the CD Rom was not compatabale with my Notebook a Dell D600 as the card did not work. So I opted to return it and had my Grandson Lucas install a Wireless Card he had and everything worked fine.
4,Great wireless card. Upgrade drivers didn't work though.,"The card works great with WinXP. When I tried to upgrade it using the drivers from linksys website, it bombed. use the original driver disks that come with the card, they work great.Overall, decent performance for a PCMCIA wireless card, good range and strong signal pickup."
2,Wireless Laptop Card,I bought this card to help my son's laptop receive the signal on his laptop and after installing it; it did not show hardly any difference! He still had a hard time getting the wireless signal in our home while my laptop did great with a different type of card!So one star for fast shipping and one for the price is the best that I can do at this point!Maybe someone else has had better success than us!Thanks!!!
1,No drivers for Linux!!! And no plan to provide...,"Broadcom (the chipset producer) has no intention of releasing the info for their adapter. They don't want to provide drivers for Linux. A good reason to buy a different product.But if it's too late for me, probably you are still in time...PS: even for different products, check the chipset on board"
1,802.11G Flat,I was looking forward to faster wireless in my home than my older 802.11B card gave me. This card was a severe disappointment. It has far less sensitivity in picking up the signal than my 802.11B card has and often times will not connect at all even though the notebok it is in stays in one location. I have reverted to my old B card for faster and more consistent response.
2,Software isn't very good and tech support sucks and can't put laptop on standby.,"The instructions that came with it were terrible and tech support is in India and they don't really know what they are talking about. Plus, my laptop is UNABLE to enter standby mode with this adapter plugged in. I have to pull it out each time I set my laptop on standby or the laptop will freeze"
2,How to Install this Wireless Adapter,"My wireless adapter is WPC54G ver.4 This product can not work on Win 98SE. I have tried and not success even I reformated my HD and reinstalled the OS. However, it works just fine for XP. The driver did not work with XP, so I used Wireless Zero Configuration or WZC to install the adapter. In additional, setting up WAP in the router requires a little bit time consuming, but it works. My notebook is an old Dell Inspiron 5000 with 600 MHz and 192 ram."
1,Avoid this product at all costs - it's not too late for you,"Don't waste your money, it will has issues that you can't imagine. I have a Dell laptop with XP that is otherwise perfect. The card slows it down to a crawl when opening certain pages and entering msn services. It also freezes programs that don't use an internet connection. Avoid this product at all costs."
1,"DOESN'T WORK, ISN'T SUPPORTED","Linksys can't tell me how to make this product work with a wireless LAN.I purchased the WPC54G Notebook adapter, the Linksys WRT54G Wireless Router and a Linksys WMP54G Wireless PCI Adapter. The cards can link with the router, but not send any data. Furthermore, the wireless link doesn't work unless WEP security is off. You have to broadcast your data in the clear!With an all-Linksys solution, you would think Linksys could make this work. Nope. Linksys tech support can't offer any solutions that you can't read off their website. If the website was helpful, that wouldn't be a problem.Don't even think about purchasing this product!"
2,Doesn't install on all laptops.,"The card installed nicely on my Dell Inspiron, butthe installation hung on my HP Pavilion (severalpeople have described similar experiences).Updated drivers on the website didn't work either.Interesting neither Linksys nor HP have mentionedthis in their support databases. Given the numberof responses this can't be a fluke."
2,This isn't a good card...,"This card was purchased because I had a coupon making this what I thought was a very good deal. I was wrong.I've installed a lot of wireless cards and this one was just terrible. I followed their directions to the letter and it just kept telling me that it had associated with the AP but couldn't find the network or the Internet. OK, I finally used the profile page to enter all the settings manually (IP, DNS, Gateway, you get the idea) and it connected immediately. However, I shouldn't have had to do that.It turns out that the IP address the card was trying to use didn't come from my router. I have no idea where it was getting it (nearby unsecured linksys router?)Once configured, the card has a tough time holding a solid network connection at what I deem a reasonable distance.IMO there are better cards out there."
5,so much better than USB,"I previously had a usb wireless adapter, it took a beating hanging out there. This one is solid and works great."
4,Great footage!,"When this hit the streets, I had it on LASER DISC! When you get it...turn it up! You can't possibly get the full experience without the volume turned up!"
5,wonderful!,I used the Perlier Ylang Ylang boddy foam wash for a long time and it was such a luxurious product! It left my skin soft but not greasy and the scent was not overpowering. I would love to find more!
1,Just a bunch of babble,"This book is sooooooooo lame. It can start a discussion but they don't offer any new or interesting points of view. Women see good men............they just overlook lame, egotistical, broke, lazy, wanna-be players, etc. Real women recognize Real men."
4,a nice place to start,"This fine book inspires as well as educates. It gives a nice overview of the trail as well as some handy info. The pictures are beautiful and writing very colorful. It made me want to go hiking right now. It offers perhaps the best way to do the trail, slow and relaxed. If I only had the time.RC"
1,PLextor Drive Fuction Review,"1- If you repair a scratched CD or DVD, then this drive CAN NOT read it while a basic player can.2- The software came with the drive, does not work.3- For DVD or CD burning, it's working good and relaiable."
3,..,I don't know if it is the liquid our the fog machine buy it didn't come out very thick. I will try a different brand next time
3,Interesting Preface to S&G,"Paul Simon and Art Garfunkel recorded this under the stage names of Tom & Jerry while still in high school. It features doo-wop style songs. Their first hit ""Hey Schoolgirl"" is innocently charming, but some of the songs are painfully mushy. It's an interesting listen if only to see where how far S&G came from these sugar-sweet pop ditties."
3,Case is hard to open,It is working OK but the needle is a little heavy on the north pointing. The case is very hard to open.
4,Horror Fans Rejoice: 4 and 1/2 starts,"Looking for some good horror? You've found it. Serenity Falls has the trappings of classic horror tales like Salem's Lot, Wither, The Exorcist, and The Keep. Like those other books Serenity Falls first sets up the everyday life of the community in which it takes place before starting to reveal the horrors that lurk behind seemingly normal doors. I don't want to reveal any more about the story because I feel that horror is best left for the reader to discover at his or her own pace, and to give away details now would take away from your own enjoyment.The only place where this book fails (besides too many typos!) is that it is only the introduction to the story. This book leads into the confrontations that will take place in the second installment, and I wish that the story had been published in one volume instead of being split into three."
3,Decent product marred by bad documentation,"The unit performs well with my Mac iBook, even WPA security works as advertised and without connection drops. The range is reasonable, I'll be trying out a better antenna soon.Note: WPA security does not work when the unit is configured for wireless repeating. This is an issue with the WPA standard, it does not allow for that.The documentation is as good as worthless for setting these things up. The troubleshooting section is actually a glossary, and is useless for getting things to work. Linksys can learn a lot from Apple in this respect, their configuration utility just works, and the documentation is actually useful. Apple's gear is about three times the price of Linksys', however.If you're a gearhead you can get this thing to work (hint: the default IP address is 192.168.1.245/24, empty userid password 'admin'). Otherwise keep looking."
1,Don't Waste Your Time,"This product never worked for me. I was fooled by the linksys reputation and the fact that I had a working BEFSR41. I wanted to keep everything Linksys so I bought this and the G notebook adapter. I could never get it to recognize the access point although everything appeared to be working. I then called support which was an absolute horrible experience. I called 6 times, waiting on hold and average of 40 min each time. I was hung up on twice, put on hold about 200 time to ""check the knowledge base"", lied to about being sent something in email and was told that it didnt matter to them if I returned it or not. I was also told by support that I was trying to set up a ""complicated network"" even though all 3 products were linksys. So after 3 days worth of headaches and horrible support I took it back and went with Belkin which setup in 5 minutes!!! Please go with them instead of Linksys. Don't be fooled like me."
4,Great addition to wired network,Linksys access point is easy to hook up. I recommend using all the same brand for the sake of simplicity. Make sure you set up the security options.
1,IT in Texas,"I purchased the WAP54g in tangent with the WPC54g Notebook adapter, also from Linksys. I was able to set up the access point in a matter of minutes in unsecured mode. After changing security settings in the access point I have had intermittent difficulty with maintaining connection. The access point stops responding requiring a hard reset and reprogramming. After several attempts to resolve the problem with Linksys they have stopped responding to support requests. I have installed more than 50 Linksys products in the last five years and this is the first disappointment I have with any Linksys product (also the first time I have ever used their tech support). With many comparable products by other companies offering similar performance, options, and price I would recommend shopping elsewhere for wireless networking."
1,Sucks when using as client,"This is the text from the web control panel. It doesn't work with other brands and so you can't get a signal even though it's in range. Would not buy again since the functionality is so limited.""Note: When set to ""AP Client"" and ""Wireless Bridge"" mode, this device will only communicate with another Linksys Access Point (WAP54G). When set to ""Wireless Repeater"" mode, this device will only communicate with another Linksys Access Point (WAP54G) and Linksys Wireless-G Router (WRT54G)."""
2,Don't buy unless you have an IT background,"I bought this as an upgrade to the BEFW11S4. I already had plenty of the WPC11 cards so thought this would be a simple change of boxes. It wasn't. The new box found the Internet right away but I could not get any of my laptops to communicate with it wirelessly. Finally, I found an article on the Linksys knowledgebase suggesting changing the transmission rate on the Advanced tab to Auto from whatever it was at out of the box if you have a mixed (b) and (g) network. After that, my WiFi laptop with XP found the network. I still can't get my other laptops that have actual WPC11 Linksys cards to work with it. I've fiddled with every advanced setting there is--simple things like Beacon rate, fragmentation threshold, preamble mode, RTS threshold. Still no luck. I'm about four hours into it so far. Big loss of valuable time."
2,Poor software and configuration,"I tried to run the automatic setup more than 5 times, no luck. I then used Windows to look for the wireless network and set it up that way. I cannot log onto the access point by entering it's IP address (192.168.1.245) into a browser window. It appears to work fine, has a long wireless range but I cannot setup the wireless security."
5,Linksys WAP54G,I have now purchased 3 of the WAP54G's (2 for the office and 1 for home). The second one I purchased for the office and the one for home I had set up in less than 5 minutes. The signal is strong as at home I have the access point in the basement and broadcast it to my daughter's room upstairs. At the office the access is upstairs and the wireless laptops are used downstairs and we get a great signal. I highly recommend this access point.
3,"Love the bands, where's the lead guitars?","The first reviewer, ""A Reviewer"" got it right. Certain lead guitar riffs on both ""Skynyrd"" and ""38 Special"" cuts can barely be heard. If you can play guitar, fill in the parts as you watch the DVD, that's what I did. Otherwise, just enjoy what you can hear and see. It's still worth buying."
4,A Little Soft,"I am using this product in my 5th wheel trailer in addition to another 3"" sleeping pad. This egg crate pad is a bit soft. I believe if it was firmer that it would work better. Still, not bad."
1,Not sized as advertised,"I ordered the queen size bed pad, and when I received it I tried to put it on my queen size bed. It was much too small (about 6 inches short in both dimensions), and a tape measure confirmed that it was not as large as advertised. When I called CW Medical to notify them of the error, they informed me I'd have to pay for shipping to return it plus a 15% restocking fee -- even though the bed pad did not match the dimensions advertised. No amount of protesting could change their minds. Buy at your own risk."
3,comfy,"I was a little confused about the egg crate style of a foam pad but that doesn't make my bed any less comfy. The 4 inch pad means the little nubs on the pad are 4 inches, not the whole pad, which made me a little disappointed. Very good quality, even with the confusion it definitely fits my comfort needs."
1,I don't think it worth a purchase at all,"I did not figure out a way to return it. O.W., I will definitely do it."
1,Caused Massive Allergic Reaction - CWI not full refund-BAD,PRODUCT SMELLS LIKE CHEWING TOBACCO AND GAVE ME HIVES ON MY WRIST -THE HAND I USED TO REMOVE IT FROM THE PACKAGING. MY TONGUE SWELLED UP IN MY MOUTH. VERY SCARY. 8 DAYS LATER I AM STILL ITCHY AND ANGRY. THEY ARE CHARGING ME A 15% RESTOCKING FEE. THIS FROM A MEDICAL SUPPLY COMPANY. MY WIFE AND I BOTH WORK AT HOSPITALS AND ARE CONTACTING OUR SUPPLY DEPARTMENT HEADS TO HAVE THIS COMPANY REMOVED FROM OUR CONTRACTS.I AM MOST UPSET BECAUSE THEY SENT ME SOMETHING THAT SMELLS AWFUL AND COULD HAVE CLOSED MY AIRWAY AND THEN ASKED IF IT WAS IN RESALE-ABLE CONDITION. THEY WANT TO GIVE IT TO YOU!
2,BAAAAD,"It arrived in a box but the box had a grocery bag in it, I assume the fuel was in the bag but the bag was ripped open with the fuel just rolling about inside. The fuel was in a plastic bottle not metal like picture has on website. The bottle had no seal under cap and also their was fuel on bottle. I would NEVER refer this fuel to anyone."
1,diagnosis for disaster,I shared my abuse experience with Claudette Wassil-Grimm to help other survivors. I was told by her that her book was going to help support incest survivors by telling their experiences. I was mislead and in her book she claimed that I had false memories. My words were used for her own agenda. I don't want this to happen to anyone else.
5,A good mystery for all ages.,"If you want to read a book that makes you want to keep reading then the THE WRIGHT3 is the book for you.This intruiging mystery will make you think in new ways.If you read the first one then you'll think this one is even better with the new character and plot,but if you haven't read the first one I recommend you do and then you should read this one(so that you will know the characters better).Hopefully you will love this book as much as i did.PS.The first book is called CHASING VERMEER."
1,Schiffer,"I have purchased my last book published by Schiffer.Not even coffee table quality.These people glitz it up with glossy paper and hard covers and charge an extraordinary amount for a book with no or little actual meaningful content.You would be much further ahead in the learning dept. by attending a club sponsored event in any of the fields they've published. Like MUCH further ahead.Over the years I bought books on coin operated, coin banks, tins, Porcelain Enamel Advertising, Battery Toys, Furniture and a whole host of other collector subjects that I needed as an auctioneer looking for information that would be useful in my advertising certain items. The books are total crap."
2,Dumped into the Warner Archives,"With so many of Jean Harlow's films - even gems such as ""Bombshell"" - still missing on DVD, fans have been hoping the long-promised boxed set would finally arrive this year. A boxed set of her own on pressed DVD to celebrate her one hundredth birthday. Instead, what we get are a few overpriced DVD-Rs in the Warner Archive series and this boxset - on DVD-R as well. Surely this is very bad taste. Shame on you, Warner! A few of these films (""Reckless"", for example) have been available on DVD in Europe for a while - but not in the United States. Isn't it strange how the American cultural heritage is neglected by that company? Whoever is responsible for releasing this on DVD-R, must have written ""unprecedented ignorance"" as their main qualification on their application form. I don't like this product => only two stars. Jean Harlow deserves better than that."
4,Better than nothing,I've been waiting for Bombshell to be released on DVD for a very long time. The DVD-R is better than nothing but a restoration and blu-ray release would be greatly appreciated. Amazon's price for this set is very high. The list price on the Warner Archive site is $49.95. It's also cheaper on Deep Discount.
2,Doesn't Fit,"Neither the small end of the brush with the big plastic knob nor the larger bushier end fits through the neck opening of my step-up, intermediate alto saxophone. The small end will fit if I remove the big plastic knob, but now I've got a twisted pair of sharp, exposed 9-wire getting inserted into (and scratching) my horn - not good. The larger end will fit into my sax's bell, but even with a bit of pre-shaping, it doesn't quite make the journey through the lower bend of my sax which means the moisture collecting down there doesn't get wicked. Great product concept, but it needs to go back to the drawing board for better engineering to be more useful."
4,Helps keep the moisture out,"Run this through the inside of your horn to swab out all that spit. Do NOT leave it in your horn after you clean it. That keeps the moisture next to your pads. It has to be cleaned, but didn't have directions how. We used a very little detergent and rinsed a lot, then air dried. Very useful tool."
2,"Wanted to love it, but didn't work...","I wanted to love it, but it didn't help my itchy bichon at all. She gets hot spots on one of her legs that is constantly itchy and we can't figure out what kind of allergy she has. Unfortunately, this didn't stop her biting and licking at all. We used it religiously for about a week."
2,Smells pretty good but doesn't stop itching,I saw the good reviews on this and decided to pick this up at my local pet store. The product smells pretty good but it certainly doesn't stop itching. My puppy likes to chew on his paws until they go raw and this didn't make him stop itching. I would recommend this as maybe a deodorizer but not to stop itching.
2,Did not work,Used this spray on my cocker spaniel smells good but did nothing for her itching. It was a real dissapointment
5,Best Anti Itch Spray,My dog suffers from allergies and is constantly itching this product really stops him from scratching. It takes about 10 minutes to work and then my dog is at peace.
5,A must-read collection of short stories for men and women,"Daughters of Kerala offers a rare insight into the innermost beings of Kerala women and their relationship with men in a context not easily available in the West. Chosen with an open mind from a vast sea of short stories in Malyalam, each story is a brilliant gem that is meant to enjoyed and treasured, one at a time. I would highly recommend this book for a program in Women's studies and for some deeply satisfying reading."
5,good fidler,"Stevie is my hero. Rock and Roll and Blues rule...Stevie rules, expecially in this video. This is the most intensely played set that I've ever seen anyone do. Man what a thrill it would have been to actually be there for this blazing performance. A previous review claims that you might find yourself ""laughing in awe"" at his raw talent. This is entirely true. You can feel him working into the most impossible progressions and scales along the fretboard of his guitar. You can anticipate them and when he completes a run you can sense a feeling of approval from the fallen guitar god. Buy this,...get DVD if you want a real punch."
5,Jimi Hendrix Reborn,"I haven't seen ""Stevie Live"" before until my friend recommend for me. It's the great sound and good camera edition live. He played like a part of his body and soul like Hendrix. Don't waste the time in eric clapton's style(except Cream). Just buy it."
5,Some of the best live guitar ever,"Watch Stevie, think of all the drugs and weirdness passing through his life at that point, before he cleaned up, and marvel at his 500 note to the bar jam."
1,burns!!!!,I had this hair dryer for only 3 months before my hair started smoking and I got burns on my hands from the dryer. I will be emailing Revlon immediately. DO NOT BUY-DANGEROUS!!!!!
5,Excellent,Purchased for normal use. My wife made use of it like heating machine in winter.Still it managed to stay live after continuous us of around 8-12 hours.
4,RV474 is a good value for the money,My wife owned one of these for several years before it died. They are cheap to buy and this one lasted 4 years. It did the job and she liked it. So we bought another one....hard to beat the price and value.
2,Not enough force,I bought this dryer because my other dryer died. I am so disappointed. It may have 1875 watts but it just doesn't have the power to dry my hair. My hair is only shoulder length. I have to hold the dryer so close to my head that I am constantly knocking myself in the head with it. Would not buy another Revlon dryer unless I could road test it first.Since that isn't going to happen I guess I need to switch dryer brands.
4,FARCICAL CHUCKLES,"What starts out like a comic strip Moreauville slowly draws the reader into a whirlpool dystopia--science gone mad. What happens when man develops intellectual, symbiotic relationships with genetically smart supercomputers? Chalker paints a computer, Ariel, who can design stem cells to either transform men into unique chimera animals or give them the forever sought after fountain of youth. The book leads the reader through some heavy plodding as the protagonists are pitted against some beasts from hades. The hoped for ending will not disappoint, however, if ever there was ever a contrived, spit in your eye, happy ending this is it.PS: Congrats to Chalker for breaking sexual taboos in sci-fi by including the exploits of a bragging Italian Stallion and a Big Breasted Babe. Hopefully his crystal ball is smogged regarding the future thrills a church wedding can provide."
4,Speakers for my Ford,I bought these to replace the stock speakers in my 05 Explorer. They fit perfectly. No Problems. You cant use the grilles in the Explorer but they do show nicely throught the panels. I dont think that these would work well with an amp as the rating is only 65 watts (maximum 250) and they get overpowered easily at higher volume levels. I use these with the Sony CDX-gt81uw. (which is an AWESOME deck but that is a different story!) They sound real good at regular levels and have excellent highs especially since they have the super tweeter. Overall I am happy with these. The quality is excellent but that's what I expect from Sony. Great replacement speakers that I would recommend for you to replace your lame Ford stock speakers.
5,Heston is always good in a Movie,I already have my own copy of this movie but wanted a Factory made copy. I haven't taken the wrap off of the tape so I haven't watched it yet but I know it will be alright.
5,Great movie,"One of my all time favorites. Had to buy it for my old friend, who should have been a mountain man. Thanks"
4,Like the Movie? read the book,I watched this movie during the same time I was reading the Terry C. Johnston books on Titus Bass (fictional Character) and found the two very similar. It was nice to see and hear the characters of the books come alive.
4,A Very Nice Anthology Of A Wonderful Pop Organist,"Here is a good selection of the many moods, styles, colors and sounds that the LATE GREAT ETHEL SMITH could evoke from the Hammond Organ. Sheliterally could play it all and did. Only the early CD sound transfer prevents me from giving this five stars. Her Latin sounds were truly spectacular and won her a truly deserved fame. I love her blues, jazz and swing also."
5,lots of great scarves to make,This book was full of scarves that defy fads. Many are very easy to make and even a beginner can feel successful.
5,A+ Book for Beginners,"In my opinion, if you want to crochet scarves, you will not find a better book than this one. This book is loaded with bright and colorful pictures on every page, easy to understand and follow instructions including details on each stitch used in each pattern. Each pattern also has a yarn gauges, so you can substitute any yarn you might have on hand.Each of the 20 projects are totally different in look and style. Once you understand the concept of each project, you can take several of the projects and mix and match them together to create even more personalized projects.Not only does this book contain scarves for women, but also a few for children and men.Thank you so much to the author for publishing such a wonderful book."
5,Funniest thing ever,This is the BEST video!! Its sooo hilarious! It also has music videos from before the got big like dammit and josie (which are funny too) and home videos and a whole bunch of other stuff! It also has what their famous for- running around naked!
1,"Beware: ""paperback"" version is only a 20-page lab book","The ""paperback"" that is included in the listing is NOT a textbook ~ it's a 20-page hole-punched set of ""lab notes."" Not remotely worth $8."
2,OK for the beginner.,"My husband is a Farrier and this book is fine for the beginner, but I would not recommend for anyone that is advanced."
5,Much Better Than Expected,"To begin, the poster showed up two days before amazon even said it was shipped to my city, so it arrived way ahead of schedule.And it was in PERFECT condition although kept in a shabby box and wrapped up poorly.The quality was incredible and the poster was even better than I'd expected.I highly recommend this product."
2,Here we go again . . .,"BEWARE! Although this is the finest these films have ever looked or sounded, Fox once again shows us how little they think of those of us who buy their products. Live Free or Die Hard is PG-13 here, once again. I had emailed fox for information on this set, and within 24 hours, someone responded, stating that Die Hard 4 would be the R rated version. The lied. I'm not surprised, but I and friends of mine bought this set on that tidbit, and realized we were duped. Live and learn. But what is the excuse this time for this second blu box of die hard that the 4th film is not presented in it's R rated form, Fox? I doubt we will ever know. It's obvious Fox is incapable of telling the truth."
4,I HAVE DIED SO HARD I CANNOT BE ANYMORE DEAD !!!,"GOT THIS SET FOR A GREAT PRICE. I JUST WANT TO KNOW WHY THE ""LIVE FREE OR DIE HARD"" BLU-RAY IS NOT THE ""UNRATED"" VERSION LIKE THE REGULAR DVD. THEREFORE, 4 STARS."
3,Am I the only one with no DTS-HD audio for Die Hard 2?,Am I the only one with no DTS-HD audio for Die Hard 2? I just recieved a replacement for this set because the first one had no DTS-HD audio for Die Hard 2. All the other discs are fine. Its as if the disc does not have it because when you select it from the menu no sound comes out but other audio options work correctly.
4,Not the Unrated Version,"Good set, especially for the price... but be warned that Live Free or Die Hard is NOT the unrated version."
3,Update?,They pushed this set so hard and yet we have to wait until they fix a glitch to be able to watch them. Who knows when that will be?If I put out a product and pushed very hard to sell it I would have been sure it worked first.
4,Die Hard works in Blu-Ray...,"We had the other DVDs but decided to get the set in Blu-Ray, all the Die Hard movies are much better in Blu-Ray."
3,PG-13 version of Live Free Or Die Hard in 1/29/13 release.,"I got the edition released on 1/29/13 and have not watched all the movies yet and will amend this review after I do. The PG-13 version of Live Free Or Die Hard is included, not the R version. Fox did an amazing job not putting the ratings anywhere on the box, the discs themselves, or in any of the product descriptions. The only way to know was to actually put the disc in."
3,Still no Un-rated Version...,"Classics, of course, but this re-packaging of the first four films STILL doesn't include the Un-rated version of Die Hard 4. Do your self a favor and wait until fall of 2013 when Fox will release all 5 (!!) restored and remastered with ""Die Hard 4 Un-rated"" finally on blu-ray."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"Waste of money, And when you pay for it and unpack it and give a test drive for the first time is that you will realize that you have wasted your money, and when you try to return it to see if you can get your money back guess what?Amazon won't take it back cause it has some liquids or something like that.so you stuck with a machine that don't work and personally for me didn't help any of my scratch disc at all.since i can return it and it don't work i said to my self, well let's use it as a cleaner to just clean the disc, (BIG MISTAKE)it actually scratch my unscratched disc and i wanted was to clean it.you can buy this item if you want im just warning you, or if you going to get it anyway (HEY BUY MINE FOR 25% Of The Price) hell just pay for the shipping"
1,It didn't work for me.,"I bought this product hoping to fix a minor scratch in a Windows installation CD that was preventing me from installing it. I followed the instructions in the book, and put it through both the buffing and repair cycles. After it was finished, the disc didn't work any better than before, and there were circular marks left on the disc from the process. I tried it again and again as was suggested in the instructions, and it never fixed the disc to workable condition. Afterwards, I tried other CDs to see if my Windows disc merely didn't fall into the ""99%"" of CDs that this product supposedly fixes, and this machine failed to fix them either. Don't waste your money on this product."
3,Jury Still Out,"Didn't have any luck repairing scratches on my CDs, but in the process of unsnapping & snapping different buffing disks to the unit, one broke (and there are no extra disks).You have to snap a hard plastic abrasive disk to a hard plastic holder. If you repairing and cleaning, you may have to do this several times in the process. A hard plastic peg does not hold up when forced into a hard plastic hole. Not enough flexibility. And you have four pegs per disk x three types of disks x two disks used per each process."
1,Scratches you Discs More - No Refunds Either,"Well, i figured i'd try this item on my scratched discs....and i even bought a refill for it for a total of $65 (down the drain!). The cleaner just ended up scratching my disc more! I followed the instruction to the ""t"". I had a disc with some pretty bad marks, but the rest was ok...used the repair wheels, then the cleanig wheels, then the buffing wheels. I did it over and over again, for about 3 hours, and the disc still has this circular pattern scratched into it from the repair wheels. Basically ruined my disc....Oh, by the way, Amazon won't let you return these specific items because of the cleaning solution. BEWARE!!!"
3,Could be more useful,"This is a very well-curated collection, but the lack of an index is frustrating. The editor does a nice job of making some connections between the pieces in each section, but could do more to summarize each piece and explain its importance in the literature. Sadly, I won't be using this for my undergraduates."
1,Doge Ram 1500 rear floor mats,"I purchase these mats for my Doge Ram quad cab and they didn't fit, I have bucket seats up front, not sure if that matters or not. They were to big and didn't conform to the floor very well. Overall the mat seemed very cheap quality and didn't meet my expectations. I believe a two piece design would be better also. They were returned for a refund. I suggest looking elsewhere for a rear floor mat but I haven't found one yet that I like for the hemi."
1,this band sucks,i have seen these guys open up for strapping young lad. They are very very good musicians. But they dont know how to make enjoyable music. Not only that but the singer is awful!! But anyway these guys might have some potential if they try harder next time who knows
2,This book would rate higher if the orthodox view was primary,"Four Views of Hell fails to forthrightly present the orthodox view of hell. Walvoord's presentation is well done and is to be affirmed, but the context in which he is presented offers him as archaic and uninformed. The orthodox view of hell is caricatured in this book."
4,Great product or travelers!,"As a frequent traveler, I've been looking for a product like this for a long time--simple, sturdy refillable clear plastic tubes for my toiletries while traveling. I've never seen a kit like this sold in stores. I was most interested in the smaller tube sizes for carry-on liquids while flying and for the many weekend trips I take. But I can also see myself using some of the larger containers for longer trips and around the house. Also you can fill the little tubes with lotions and hairspray for carrying around in your purse.The product comes with more than is shown in the picture. There is a big syringe and plastic tubing and all kinds of tips for filling the tubes directly from your existing product's bottle. There is also a clear plastic zippered storage bag to hold the whole kit.I am so glad I found this product!"
3,Not The Real Story,"This will be short. If you're interested in the Earp legend and the story of Tombstone; buy or rent ""Tombstone."" Nothing else comes close. I love the work of John Sturges but this is not his best work. ""Hour of the Gun"" as a great cast of actors and James Garner is perfect as Wyatt Earp. However, both Jason Robards and Robert Ryan are badly miscast in their roles. The claim for historical accuracy is also an issue best illustrated by the fact that Wyatt Earp did not kill Ike Clanton as is portrayed at the end of this picture."
4,Easy,I purchased this book with a DeLonghi GM 6000 gelato making machine I made the vanilla gelato right away as the first gelato in the machine was super easy to make and came out so rich and creamy the book also has a little history on gelato which is interesting. I have only tried the one recipe as yet but they all look very good and I am glad I purchased the book and plan on trying the other recipes especially the granite
2,Quantity not Quality,"I am a graduate student and I'm using this book for a class. The book is very theoretical with too few examples. At first it seems that the book was written for a novice with very little computer science background since the author has the need to explain the core vocabulary in computer science. That is not the case as the later chapters get into more advanced topics, but lack the proper explanation. The book presents many test patterns but fails to include examples which would guide one in developing a test suites with the presented patterns. Some of the examples that are provided include mistakes which would misguide a novice learner. The reading is frustrating at times due to lack of appropriate explanations. As the subject of this review states, it seems the author wanted to write a really lengthy book not giving enough attention to the quality of the material presented."
5,A lot of insites on Cole Porter,Well written and interesting book on an enigmatic figure. Service was fast and as promised.
4,A decent Jazz primer,"Not Ken Burns, but it doesn't take 10 hours to watch, either. I use this DVD to introduce students to Jazz history over the Burns video, simply because the Burns video is too big, too long, and too inclusive. However, that means that this DVD leaves out much. My biggest problem with using it, though, is that the narration is hard to understand and goes by quickly, so that I must stop and fill in and/or reiterate points made. That said, I will continue to use it unless and until I find a better, concise version of the history of Jazz. If you are interested in the history and development of jazz, this video has some great interviews that make it worth owning."
4,Never Judge a Rat By Its Cover,"This is a wonderful book with great colorful illustrations. When a stranger sets up camp at the end of town, Duck and Pig automatically assume that because he's a rat, the stranger must be sneaky and lazy and a bad person. Only Frog takes the time to actually get to know Rat and form his own opinion. Frog not only discovers what a friendly, interesting, and helpful Rat he is, but gains a new friend. The story is just long enough for reading at bedtime, keeps your attention without being too preachy, yet teaches morals on many different levels. I think this is a wonderful book for teaching tolerance for people different from you, as well as how not to be rude like Pig. I definitely recommend it!"
1,not for a beginner or anything close to it,"You know how when you go into a guitar shop you see racks full of pamphlets with nothing but chord and scale diagrams? Well thats what this ""book"" is. Customer reviews on Amazon have helped me find a lot of cool books, but this is one time where I got suckered. This pamphlet is 103 pages long, and has very sparse amount of text between diagrams, which you will only understand if you already have a working knowledge of music theory."
5,a must have,An excellent book that is unique because it is oriented to the guitar player instead of the piano/keyboard player. Indispensable if you are serious about learning music.
3,"Worked well for two years, but...","I've been using this on my hardwood floor for two years. Its good for wiping a light spray cleaner, or to grab up the excess moisture after using a steamer. But the pad gets saturated and dirty after working on a small area, so make sure to buy extra pads, then throw them all in the wash after use. BUT...today the foam pad that is 'permanently' attached between the plastic and the the cloth fell off. Seems they don't sell a replacement for this, so I'll have to cob something together."
3,A deeply flawed but interesting account,"This is a decent book that gives an account of a little known (outside of Thailand) Buddhist reform movement that operated in the early 20th century. However, as Thanissaro Bhikkhu points out, it has some major flaws and totally misinterprets the standards of practics among the Thai Forest monks' and their conflicts with the Mahanikai and Bangkok hierarchies:[...]"
2,Delaminates quickly,"I tried to save some money by purchasing these laminating sheets to laminate menus at my restaurant. They look great - for about a week. They start delaminating around the edges fairly quickly, unlike the Fellowes product, which looks great months later. I've tried multiple heat settings, but to no avail - same problem every time. Do not use these in a demanding environment - they're probably fine for brief use, but of inferior quality."
5,The Sims Superstar Sure To Be a Hit,"First and foremost, The Sims (all) is one of my all time favorite pc games and frankly, one of the best games ever made!! They way you can control some one that's like you or someone completely different is soooooooo cool! Everyone thought that The Sims Unleashed was going to be the last of EA and Maxis' Sims Game, but boy were they wrong. It will keep on getting better with every new Sims game they make. So I highly recommend that every Sim game owner buy The Sims Superstar. I can't wait untill May 19th!!"
5,a great and entertaining game,The sims superstar is such a great expansion pack! New features and ojects allow you to explore the sims world more. the new objects are great to and fufilled my every sims need. Im very addicted to it though. Its exciting to be a celebrity but its hard to get to be one. I liked having my sim play piano or guitar do a photo shoot or do kareoke. definetly a must buy :-)
5,AWESOME...,"My stuff used to not pop up...But if your things don't pop up, and you have an anti-virus thing, you have to disable it to get it to work...So if that's anyone's problem, then that's why.Anyways...It's very awesome! This is the best Sim game yet!"
4,The Sims Superstar,"This game is a lot of fun, though there is no cheat to becoming a superstar. If you really would like to become one you need to have a lot of patience and time, plus a lot of simoleans for your sims to buy things with. Though there is one way to cheat to becoming an absolute superstar, when you buy Makin Magic Expansion Pack, there is a spell you can use to become a superstar. Don't get too excited, though, because you need black roses (from obsessed fan) to make the spell! This game becomes very fun though when you have a superstar. I personally have not made a person become a superstar, but have had a superstar marry into the family. It is especially fun when you win your first Oscar/Emmy!"
1,It Looks Fun?!,"Ok I saw the commercial for this game and i had to have it so I went to get it....I got it home and the installment went great but when i went to play it it would barely run i mean it would freeze completely up and I couldnt even play, I ended up having to lose everything i once earned like 300,000 dollars! Ah. So after I had uninstalled it I returned it got a new one and HA! The same thing happened.... I hate the game only because I can't play it and I want to really bad!... But hey maybe it's just my bad luck..."
5,How can anyone not like it!?!?!,"How can anyone say it's a bad game?!?! I mean it's so cool! There is new items, jobs, and people. There are SO many more things you can do then on any other expantion pack. I agree that it is the best expansion yet. Where els can you make your sim a celebraty? Nowhere of course. Buy it today. Trust me its worth it. There are so many other things I can tell you about this game but I'm going to let you buy it so you can figure it out.Its a really cool game and I always try not to lie so you can trust me! Have a great time..."
3,Interesting pack - needs patch,"I purchased Superstar with trepidation. I'd read about the bugs. Example: the speaking bubbles are now empty. Word of warning, if you do not have a TON of memory (well over the 128MB recommendation) you will have a very slow game. I personally have 512 and a few trips to Studio Town makes my game run slooooooow. Too many and I crash."
2,"An easy read, but contains numerous errors and omissions","An easy read, but contains numerous errors and omission"
4,An excellent book.,"From beginning to end a very gripping tale. This book revealsthe story behind the story on many of histories great espionage cases.Mr. Volkman masterfully weaves history into an exciting tale. You will learn things that you didn't know and at the same time read a book that doesn't put you to sleep. I had trouble just putting it down. If all history books were written this well I would have gotten better grades in school.I highly recommend this book for anyone interested in espionage, the inner workings of politics, or just looking for a good book to read."
3,The Greastest Spy Operations of the Twentieth Century,"Interesting to a degree but, writing style lacked necessary grab to fully hold the readers interest. I had a tendency to glaze over the content of much of this book."
5,An Excellent Introduction to the series,I am beyond thrilled that these books are being reprinted. This Can't Be Happening was the first book I ever read that wasn't Nancy Drew and I loved it! I can't wait to introduce my niece and nephew to Bruno and Boots and the Fish. I highly recomend this book and the rest in the series.
3,"Nice radio, poor reception :(","The radio has easy to read dial numbers and is easy to use, but the reception isn't the greatest. I like that it is battery operated, but the antenna is very easily manipulated."
4,A winner,"Good quality for the price---durable and reliable. It's a bit difficult to situate for best reception, but the sound quality is somewhat better than you'd expect. I'd definitely buy again (and have, for more rooms)."
5,A great buy for $19.95 in 2007. Not worth $99.95 in 2008!!!,"Panasonic RF-2400 AM / FM RadioThe 99.95 price has to be a typo, but it still comes up the same in the shopping cart, so I guess I'll have to buy it somewhere else. Purchased this radio last September to listen to Yankee games when working in the garage. Great buy for what I was after. Decent quality and good reception, but not to expensive to worry about it getting scratched or dropped. Still using the original batteries after hours of post-season baseball. HOWEVER; I was going to purchase another one for my work site, but at today's price of $99.99 I figure it will be cheaper to just pay John Sterling to come by at work and give me a personal play-by play."
1,EA Sports F1 Challenge '99--'02 review,"After reading the positive reviews I thought I would give this one a try. This game sucks. It does not even come close to Sierra's Nascar 2003.(which is awesome) The graphics are poor, and the whole feel of it is very low grade. I do not recommend this game even if you get it for half price. Total waste of money!"
3,where is the image stabilzation ?,I just received this camera and was disappointed. I cannot see what the point of Image stabilization is if you cannot select it for ALL of the functions on the camera. There is a selection on the dial for IS but you can't do anything else with it in any other mode and YOU CANNOT use it when you need it the most and that is during VIDEO capture.. Again what is the point of having it ??? Spend some additional $$ and get the next level camera V1253 that HAS IM on video selection otherwise you will be disappointed in any video capture that isn't set up on a Tripod.
1,I can't believe Kodak would release a camera like this,"Still photos are fine. But I bought this camera for the 720p HD video. Unfortunately the digital image stabilization system overcorrects for the slightest camera movement, the result being uncontrollably jittery and shaky videos (left to right and back again) even when the camera's actual movement was minor. The effect is that instead of dampening the effect of camera shake it amplifies it. And the stabilization feature cannot be shut off in video mode. Kodak's help line says it is a feature, not a defect. As of early August 2009 there is no firmware update for this ""feature."" The simplest non-stabilized camera produces better videos."
5,Great camera for the price <$200,"Whoever has problem viewing the picture at major cropping, please use Microsoft's Picture Manager instead of Kodak software came with the camera.Only complain I have is the resolution of the LCD display. Other than that everything is great. Some seem to have problem with batteries life, took 140 pictures with one charge. The battery icon showed up after 100 picture. It seems to be OK.If the size and budget are the concerns, this is the camera for you."
2,blurry pictures,"Using a tripod, and every different combination on this camera. Shots come out, too dark, too blurry, not enough detail even with 12mp. I would not recommend this camera for purchase."
2,Just Returned,"I just returned this camera to the store where I purchased it. The LCD was grainy, and had lines running across it. The processing time was slow and not helpful in taking pictures of my active 8 year old. I got a great Christmas shot with the camera, but only after I put it on a tripod. My plan is to purchase the Kodak Z812 which got much better reviews."
4,"Nice colors, zoom, and movie mode, but needs optical stabilization","The 12 mega pixel photos look great under optimal lighting (outdoors or day light). The color reproductions is rich and realistic. The 5x zoom is a nice feature and very useful especially with good lighting.When lighting is poor the quality is still good but not great. The ISO mode for low light and sports gives a stable picture, but with colors and resolution that are significantly less impressive.The Hi-Res HD movie mode is excellent and very decent even in most lighting. Being able to operate the zoom while filming is an excellent feature. All cameras should be able to do that. The biggest problem is that when you are at maximum zoom the video gets very shaky. A camera this nice should have optical image stabilization."
3,An ash from the embers of another time.,"This publication is about halfway in size between a pamphlet and a small book, having a total of 84 pages, of which 18 are index, notes, and identification of the author. However, even though it is quite small, it succinctly lays out the high points of the involvement of the people of Texas in the War Between the States. Pleasingly enough, it touches upon the high points of the period such as the Battle of Sabine Pass and the low, such as the murder of Union sympathizers near Fredricksburg and Gainesville.This book is not really for the avid Texas history enthusiast because it is so small that most of its information would already be known by that group. However, it is a nice, well-written little book for the reader who wants to spend an hour or so to get an overall summary of the involvement of Texas and Texans in the Civil War era."
5,Tells you all you need to know,A well researched book giving all the tips and hints that one needs to know about South Africa. The book doesn't waste your time by making recommendations and then slating them (as other guide books tend to do).
2,Not low-impact in my book!,"I was disappointed with this DVD! I was looking for something low impact, but the way they jump around is not ""true low impact"" in my book. I started with the warm up, but it was more like a full-on work out. The twists and turns, along with the fast pace are a little too much for me. There isn't enough repetition to learn one movement before they add a new movement. I have been doing step aerobics since the 80's, and it seems that each time a new steep aerobic video comes out, it tries to outdo the last one in intensity, and difficult moves. So unnecessary for a good work-out! I would not recommend this video to my friends who are looking for something low impact."
2,Not a practical choice for a 2 year old...,"I bought this train for my 2-year-old son for Christmas. Beside choosing a destination and saying ""Go,"" he isn't involved in the operation of the train at all. He wants to push it and play with it, but that just messes up the system the train has. After one day of play, it's ""brain"" stopped working right and would not move to the destination of choice. We returned it the day after Christmas! Maybe it would be more fun for older kids, but I would not recommend it for 2-year-olds."
3,Twins on Toots,"My three year old twin boys enjoyed Toots the Train at first, but they were easily distracted from it. They liked how they pressed a button to where they wanted it and then after they say ""go"" it would, but there's not much more to it. It is not very educational and the excitement of it running on its own wears off quickly. A bit pricey for so little entertainment."
4,toots the train,we bought this for my daughter's second birthday and overall she enjoys it. the only comment that is negative is that when you try to pull all the cars-it either disconnects or will stop due to too much weight. most of the time we just run the engine by itself. it was a big hit at her birthday party.
2,Noisy and Unreliable,"We got this as a gift for my 2 year old last Christmas. My son is VERY into Trains and was very excited. It worked for about 2 hours, then it began doing all sorts of things... it is a very loud toy (with NO volume control) and it has never worked right. We exchanged it for a new one, and it worked a few weeks and then did the same things. It would just go off, it would start talking when it wasn't being played with or it wouldn't do anyting when you did play with it. My son finally got frustrated with it and we gave up on it. Don't waste your money."
3,Got its good and bad,"First the good points: Eros has a great plot and awesome characters/character development. The book has a great message that I think we can all learn something from. However, the book is wracked with problems. There are many problems in the writing. Oftentimes someone will be talking for five or six sentences and the dialogue will conclude with ',"" billy said.' or something like that. In my opinion, a good run-through with a dedicated and knowledgeable editor would have made this book really good. But that's just my opinion, I could be wrong."
1,eau de toilette,"this product costs a lot of money and instead of the pleasure I would have gotten giving it to my daughter, I received a used bottlewhich was obviously a tester at a department store without a cap or a box.Although they were quick to refund the money I am still waiting for a return label despite my best and AMAZON's efforts to get one."
4,Bikini fest....not quite,"I had heard good things about this DVD on a surfing girls online forum so i picked it up. when i first started it i totally thought that it was nothing but a total bikini fest, but as it progressed it was really quite good. Not very long, but they hit a lot of the major spots (North Shore, Tahiti,The Crossing, Indo, etc) except for SoCal and Oz. The footage at Teaphoo was amazing!!! I would recommend picking it up...the extra footage at the end is hilarious."
4,I really am in love with a Princeton mathematician!,"This book was recommended to me (for obvious reasons) and I enjoyed it very much. The main character seems so insecure, though, and I found myself feeling sorry for her. So many of the feelings and things she was going through mirror my own life! As I turned each page I began to think my own boyfriend may have been used as her model! Unlike Noam Himmell, however, the ""real thing"" is quite loving and attentive."
3,Too Jewish,Poor genius and poorer philosopher. Just another Romance with a mishmash of some philosophy thrown in
3,Is life in academia really so tragic?,"I largely enjoyed this novel. It is witty and strong-minded, although the prose style itself is perhaps unremarkable. Its main virtue is in questioning assumptions about who and what matters, and why. However, the story attempts to lay claims on our sympathies for its characters, whose tragedies include the narrator's dilemma of being beautiful but (self-confessedly) a bit thick -headed (despite getting into the best philosophy Ph.D program in the country), and her genius-mathematician-husband who *gasp* no longer feels himself to be a genius. I'm sorry, but my sympathies are not aroused by those 'dumb' philosophers at Princeton and their grumbling has-been genius husbands who didn't solve Fermat's Last Theorem. Still, it's worth a read."
2,Tuff Stuff Tape Recorder,"I got the tape recorder for my 4 year for Christmas. The fact you had to hold the buttons down was not a problem. The door has come off more then once and it is hard for me and my 4 year old to get the tape out. The volum knob does not work anymore, so we either can not hear the music or it gets to loud. I wrote to Fisher-Price and they are sending me another one. As of today (8/26/01) I have not received it. On 8/27/01 I received the new tape recorder from Fisher Price. I did not have to send the broken one back."
2,nice product but not the best...,"The product is a great moisturizer for the hands & feet, but not for the body. It doesn't moisturize the body at all. I've used an extra amount too & that doesn't work either."
1,the fragrance seems old,and is not refreshing at all. I think the product may be past expiration. I love this lotion but not this one -
5,Really...this one works!,"I have dry skin. The type where you drag your nail across your skin and it leaves scratchy, dry patches. I use a very thin film of this after bathing or washing my hands. After first it you think it may be heavy, but it quickly sinks into your skin and leaves a soft, dewy sheen. My dry cuticles in the Winter weather instantly respond to this lotion. The pleasent fragrance reminds me of the end of a Summer day at the beach. Very nice. I've used many other more expensive formulas I've bought and received as part of a gift set, but this lotion really does it for me. I'll always come back to this one."
5,great lotion fast delivery,Great lotion! Cruelty free and no toxic chemicals. My skin is really dry and this is the only lotion that resolved my chronic itchy dry skin immediately. Delivery was fast!! Nice fragrance as well. very pretty smell.
1,SCOOP IS HUGE!,"From now on I am shopping for protein with servings/price in mind! Yes, it is 12 lbs, but only 16 servings!Thy expect you to drink a full bottle of powder alone per serving. The scoop is about 4x bigger than what I have normally seen.DO NOT BUY!"
5,Much Needed Resource,I picked up this book and couldn't put it down. I don't know how anyone with any type of stepfamily situation has gotten through without this survival guide. The author shares her own experiences--raising six kids as a blended family--with honesty and lots of humor. It's a must read.
2,review,"The book didn't give me the information I needed, like sugar content in grams (including natural sugars) which is what I wanted in the book."
2,low cal please,"I was disappointed in this cookbook, I am on a strict fat/calorie regimen per day and it seemed this book was not very diet friendly. There was a lot of information on foods and good tips but not a lot of usable recipes. I recommend the AHA low calorie cookbook or the biggest loser cookbook, both of which have recipes that I use over and over again, both of which I purchased from Amazon, and both of which are ""dieter"" friendly."
1,"Is cheap, is old, good picture quality","I recomend this product just if you need a camera that doesnt requiere much care, you just can carrie it even in your pocket."
2,"Bought it, but Exchanged it for a Different Camera","I bought this camera this week. I used it for a day and just didn't like it. I took it back to the store where I had purchased it and exchanged it for a different brand of digital camera which cost me a little less, but had more features.I think the biggest hang-up with this camera is the lack of zoom capability. It just isn't possible to use this camera for everyday photos because you have to get so close to the subject to get a good shot. Other problems; the buttons were too complicated, the instruction manuel was an awkward size and too wordy and complicated. The camera I ended up with was easier to use, the buttons were less complicated, the manuel easier to understand, and it had more options and took better photos for a lower price. I was disappointed with Sony for this one."
5,Great camera,"I upgraded from a run-of-the-mill 35mm camera. I love this camera!! It's easy to use, lightweight, and a very nice design. My purchase (from dell.com) came with the charger, batteries a memory stick and the computer/TV hookup cable. This camera is very, very easy to use. Recommended for first time digital camera users."
1,Sony's lower end camera,"Sluggish performance after 9 months use so if you are buying this camera for a limited time use then its a good buy but its not worth the price if you intend to use it for a long time. Warranty included is 90 days which means you dont have anywhere to go after 4-5 months of use. Simply the pic quality starts to degrade after some time. I bought it in April 2003 from Amazon for $228 and it started annoying me by July/ August 2003. The video mode is the worst ever, in the beginning it used to give much better results but I am not fond of this now anymore. Better use a camcord to capture video images.The image quality at night is rated ""0"" by me, but again it all started after a few months had passed, I had no problems with this little thing in the begining. 95% of the pics that I take now come out to be blurry and gloomy.Overall I dont recommend this camera cause it wont last long."
4,"Una Buena Camara , Un Buen Precio","Me parece que la camara tiene buena resolucion , buen tamaño pero el zoom le hace falta, yo tengo una stick de 256mb y tomo fotos espectaculares , bueno se las recomiendo!"
2,Mama Is Disappointing,"Just another boring book of attempted humor by an Erma Bombeck wannabe. In creating even more trashy words for her limited repertoire, such as ""asstacular"", Kari sinks to new lows here. One would be better off investing in a few weeks of good newspapers in order to learn something meaningful, rather than flushing dollars down the drain with Haiku Mama.The cover art was nice though."
1,A waste of Money,"Poorly written, this book is nothing more than pages and pages of 'sheets' for you to record your food intake. Don't waste your money."
4,A mod Archos monster,"I love these, got hooked on the 10gb Jukebox, and tried one of these. I use the optional firewire, and have put a 40GB hard disk out of my old dead laptop in it. Double the space = more fun. Wasnt too hard to do either, had to gently take it apart, swap out the drive and it booted first time. You can tie it to I tunes with a patch from archos.com. I've dropped, kicked, left it in the heat of my truck, still works fine, great for hotels when you put you movies on it and plug it into their TV! Got to love Archos innovation and durability."
2,Good Audio Bad Video,This device is a great Audio device But Bad Video.If you are getting this only for the video do not get this.
1,Wow This Is Bad!!!,I own exactly 438 Bob albums and boots. I can definitely say that this album is the worst. It is a collection of latin hip-hop (?) artists who created their own rhythm lines and will sporadically through in a dub vocal track from an old BMW song. It is sad that these songs are unlicensed which allows untalented opportunists like this to butcher a true talents work. It doesnt even sound good and I like latin rhythms. The only redeamable aspect of this disc is the cool photo of bob on the cover. This is horrible - don't buy it.
3,Not as fulfilling!,"This one kind of disappointed me. It based itself on an issue that is valid, and the message about the pilght of the homeless is an important one. But the anticipation for another hot Grisham made this book seem unfulfilling! Otherwise, it is a great read!"
1,A dissappointment,I admire Minot as an author and have enjoyed her other work. But I had a hard time bothering to finish this novella - it is wrong to call it a novel... indeed I gave up. It's a hopeless sorry and slim effort at chic coolness.
3,Life is not as it seems,"Lovers. The cliché. A man who is bound to a woman meets another woman who he just can't NOT sleep with. Will he leave the woman he has spent more than a dozen years with? Or will he throw away his for-sure future for a woman who has freedom, independence, sexiness? This novel is written throughout one episode of lovemaking. The thoughts that pass through their heads are revealed as her mouth wraps around him, and she brings him to orgasm. It is not as you would have imagined. We find that his thoughts drift, and he's not really as enraptured as you would think. And she believes she's giving him this gift, this bliss. Life is not ever as it seems."
3,Are you there yet?,"As can often hapen with the act that is the spindle from which Minot's rumination is spun, Rapture became quite tedius. Despite the at times really lovely prose and Minot's ability to capture the essence of how sex can make you stupid, I could not bring myself to care about either character: Kay is a fool, and Benjamin is a heel. I grew impatient waiting for the inevitable ending, devoid of any grace that ""worship"" usually brings."
5,Freakin EPIC guitar!!,"has an awesome finish to it, it stays in tune for long while and has low action(easier on my fingers) and it has a crisp sound to it. All in all i love this guitar!!"
5,Great introducton to Wicca and Lothlorin,"Rev Paul writing is easy to read and understand, and he peppers the pages with many anecdotes of his life leading up to his creation of Lothlorin. A must-read for the layperson interested in Wicca or Lothlorin!!!"
1,Warning! Does not work with all cable modems.,"I attempted to get this working with the 3COM ""sharkfin"" cable modem and Optimum Online's cable service. No connection was possible. D-Link suggested that the problem was the ISP and not the router. I found that most unhelpful as a direct connection worked perfectly well. The router is now gathering dust and I am using Win 98SE's Internet Connection Sharing. Don't waste your money on this product."
5,GREAT...BUT WHERE ARE THE LATER SEASONS???,"THIS IS ANOTHER GREAT SEASON, BUT WHY SO INTERMINALLY LONG BETWEEN RELEASES OF SEASONS? THE FIRST FEW SEASONS CAME OUT WAY BACK WHEN THERE WERE VIDEO STORES. THERE IS SUCH DEMAND FOR THESE SEASONS FROM DIE HARD HITCH FANS LIKE MYSELF. I DON`T UNDERSTAND THE DELAY. LET`S ALL CONTACT UNIVERSAL. MAYBE A LARGE RESPONSE WILL GET US SOME MORE SEASONS SOONER."
4,Great piece of investigative journalism,"Man, this book brings me back. The first half of the book, with its great descriptions of the crack 80's, reminds me of my childhood days in Brooklyn, walking into a Bodega that contained nothing but plantain chips, warm Tropical Fantasy in a broken fridge, and some dusty cat food on the shelf and wondering to myself ""How does this place stay in business?"". Yes, it was a different city back then.The second half of the book is an interesting expose of just how profoundly connected much of the hip hop scene is/was to Queens. We get to see how the limelight eventually shifted away from the real strongmen to the 'posers' like Tupac Shakur (I especially love the part about his studying ballet in high school).All in all a very enjoyable book, and definitely worth the 14 bucks I spent on it."
4,Excellent,"If your from Queens, or you have listened to 90's rap, then this is a good book for you. It explains the litany of characters(criminals) mentioned in so much gangster rap. It is also gives excellent accounts of the ""crack"" years of NYC in Queens. There were so many locations in Queens, that I was stunned to find out the history of. Well worth the cheap purchase price!"
2,You can probably find better for your money,"The controller itself is good, but the documentation is poor and pretty confusing. The manual is on the cd-rom that comes with it, but it is hidden in a .html document a few folders in. And it took me a couple of hours just to figure out which driver I needed to download from the website (they probably could have put the driver(s) right on the cd-rom).There are many programmable buttons though, and if you're much better at this stuff (or much more patient), its probably a good deal."
5,AWESOME SERIES,"ONE OF THE BEST I HAVE SEEN IN LONG TIME. HAVE WATCH SERIES TWO ALSO.WAITING FOR 3,4,ETC ETC TO BE MADE AVAILABLE FOR USA WATCHING.THEY WET YOUR INTEREST IN A GREAT SERIES..THEN TAKE A LONG TIME TO PRODUCE ADDITIONAL SETS."
3,Compare to others,"It'll do for a brass horn, but no way for a pBone horn. (pBone is too light to compress the spring)"
2,Total Fluff and Completely Biased Book,"This book is a sham. I'm sorry, but how ANYONE can claim to know what went on in the home of their mother and step-father when they were NOT there, is beyond me. Jackie Daly is trying to make a buck, pure and simple. It is a shame that she was able to rope in such a fine writer as Tom Carter has proven to be. Her mother died after many, many years of pain, surgery, and emotional distress. The medication she was taking on a DAILY basis, was a necessity for her to be able to perform, which was as essential to Tammy as breathing. For a daughter to say that she loves her mother, and then dishonor her memory in this way, is cruel. Tammy Wynette lived a very hard life, full of many abuses. The woman is finally in heaven (where she belongs) and yet, her daughter will still not let her rest. Please do not buy this book. Save yourself some money and go buy the National Enquirer, you will get more truth there, I believe.A Tammy fan to the end,Misty"
3,Wynonna unplugged - what a treat!,"Although the title is a little misleading (it's not a live concert as the title might suggest), the music is just wonderful. Wynonna sings many of her hits with just acoustic guitar accompaniment, and her rich, full, soulful voice is beautifully highlighted in each song. I wish there were more songs on this DVD, but for the price, this DVD certainly gives good value to any serious Wynonna fan. And the footage of rural Italy is just lovely."
5,Inside Buu can be a very strange place.,"After Vegetto is absorbed buu (vegetto lets him), the fusion quits working and Vegeta smashes the Potara. They search for Gohan and the others only to be nearly digested, encountered by talking snakes and fighting memories inside of buu! They finally do find the others and set them free (making Buu revert to a less powerful form). This makes Buu create an image of himself to fight the Saiyajin inside of himself. There he is invincible. I give this DVD 5 stars because it has decent fights, humor and of course 4 episodes."
1,worst ever,"Dont buy ""ants"" books. Terrible style, bad explanations, urgh ... There are a lot of tutorials to spend money for."
2,Rushed...,"Having had to buy this book for a programming class, I thought it would be a good tool to use to learn the advance java stuff. Well, there was only perhaps 1 or 2 chapters that were written well. The rest of the chapters were not good. Examples are buggy and most don't work without modification. I find the book terrible and anyone wanting to learn java, go else where. The book feeled rush and unpolished."
3,Good Quality - Missing Parts,"The net is of good quality, especially for the price. However, one birdie was missing as well as the hooks to hold the support cords. When I contacted Amazon, they were of no help, but to say contact the manufacturer. Very poor support from Amazon."
2,Not worth the money!,"I was looking to replace an old badminton set and finally decided on this one. Well, the first game out of the box, the head came loose on one of the rackets, rendering it useless. I can probably glue it, but that's not the point. Then the birdie got stuck in two of the other rackets, when you hit it very hard. What a waste of money! This isn't a cheap, $25 buck set, so I definitely expected more! I'm not sure what to do next, but I think I'll buy rackets separately and not go for the set. Who needs multiple nets just to get some rackets that aren't junk?"
3,Basic and does it's job,"I purchased this because I needed to practice taking blood pressure since I volunteer with my school's ambulance. I'm content with my purchase, it works fine and gets the job done. The diaphragm was attached to the blood pressure cuff and I didn't like that, I almost went to return it, but the diaphragm piece can be unscrewed and detached from the cuff. A couple of other notes, the diaphragm is single sided and the earpieces may hurt your ears because its made of a hard plastic."
5,Unfinished tale,"See the collection of first-person stories by the surviving commandos in Hieu D. Vu's ""Republic of Vietam Commandos"", published May, 2011."
2,MVP 2003,"This product would not install on my computer, even though I already have the 2004 and 2005 versions up and working fine."
3,awesome CD but limited to half the songs,"I thought there was about 20 songs on here, based on youtube, and they only sampled 10 song... you only get the ten songs... why??? IDK"
4,hollywood should keep it real,entertaining good . hollywood special effects detracted from the movie. should have stuck with the seals and actual weapons capability.
5,Great movie so real,"I just loved this movie and I'm not a big war movie person. The acting wasn't Hollywood acting it was the real stuff. I watched it twice and was amazed at some of the things these guys can pull off. Watch the movie, but don't expect any Matt Damon type guys these guys are straight up real. The end may make you cry (made me cry) and the song, so fitting. Enjoy!!!!"
2,Neither interesting nor entertaining,"This could have been a good action movie, or it could have been a story about the lives of men serving their country. As it is, the director did a very poor job of trying to do both and in the process did neither very well. The action scenes are well done, technically correct, and gripping, and the plot is moderately interesting and creative. But they are interspersed with a totally superficial and glib portrayal of the lives of soldiers and their families, with no real character development or interesting stories. The WWII films that the likes of Bogart and Wayne did are much better are bringing the trials and tribulations of military folks to life. The characters in this film are total cliches, and the tear-jerking is over the top. As a result, the movie is confused, trite, and not worth watching IMHO."
4,Good Action Film,"My husband and I really enjoyed Act of Valor. There was a lot of action and it seemed very realistic. We both came away from watching this with an even greater appreciation for our military. I had read that the acting wasn't too great....it was by actual Navy Seals. I thought they did fine though. We watched this movie on a 50"" plasma tv which was good for viewing all the action. I don't think I would have enjoyed it nearly as much on a tablet or laptop because of the realistic dim lighting that was used in a good part of the film."
4,Great depiction of navy seals,I'm not a seal but can believe that this movie is the closest to how the operate in theater. Pretty basic plot but the details are great
5,Awesome,The movie has action from the start and keeps you on the edge of your seat. The actors were great also.
4,Must see movie,Good movie and would recommend it for others for viewing. Had a good story line and was well acted out.
3,Acting a little choppy,"A solid movie that makes one feel like an American, a rare ideal these days. The story is well drawn and relatively easy to follow. The acting is a bit choppy but this is to be expected. I will watch this again."
4,It should have been called THE CALL OF DUTY MOVIE,"great movie, havent seen a military movie this good since like never, although some parts do remind me of the call of duty franchise, love the plot, great performance, and it gives you a sense of what military forces do look like in real life !!"
3,So un-dramatic and emotionless,"Not impressed. I read the mixed review (some good, some bad), but figured I'd like the realistic events anyways, just to know what it's really like. However, it's just so disappointing. The dramatic scenes are just in slow motion and so un-dramatic, and feels emotionless even when they're trying to depict emotion. I'm not saying that the actors don't have emotion, but rather, the depiction sucks. Bleh."
3,"Great Stories, but the actors are not actors and you can tell","Good story about special services. You can appreciate the action more knowing the ""actors"" have done it for real. Would have been a better movie with more action which is clearly a comfort zone for the portrayals."
2,Wooden Performances and Gimmicky FPS-Inspired Action,"Watching this movie is like watching someone else play Call of Duty. Decent action scenes are tainted by annoying first person views, with rifles and EOTech sights and *pew pew pew*. The action scenes seem aimed at 12-year-old video gamers.Then the action scenes end, and we get a few minutes of wooden ""actors"" chugging their way through the dialogue the best they can. There are no actual characters in this movie, just a bunch of people you have no connection to. They make one guy an expectant father in an effort to give him some resemblance of personhood, but it falls short.There's a scene in the movie where one of the dudes dies, and the music, cinematography, etc. seem to indicate that it's supposed to be an emotional moment. Didn't work for me.Not a bad action flick if you fast-forward through any scenes where people aren't shooting. But still not great."
2,"Brave Men, lame movie","This story line is of personal interest to me, however this movie is not worth your time. There are plenty of books written by real Frogs which ARE worth your time and effort to locate & read.Richard Marchinko is just one voice you should hear...."
4,Very good movie,"A very good movie, with a little bit for everyone. Action, drama, love story all wrapped up in one. And pretty amazing to see what these Marines do."
5,Humbling Movie,Fantastic movie that makes one think about the sacrifices that are made by the military. Amazing realistic action and makes you proud to be an american.
5,"Best movie I've seen in a long, long time!","This is the first movie that I have actually sat through and watched the entire thing without getting up. It has suspence, action, and a great story line. I would highly recommend this movie to everyone."
5,Good Movie,Very realistic and gripping. Keeps your close attention from start to finish. Highly recommend this movie bla bla bla bla
5,Act of Valor,This is a very good movie involving active duty Navy Seals. It gives you a peek in to their world. The types of missions they do. Their camaraderie and loyalty to each other.
2,Not very interesting,Kind of disappointed by this movie. Not very strong story or high-tech stuff. I don't think it is well positioned as an action movie.
4,For the military fan,"Borderline terrible acting, but I cannot expect SEALs to be oscar worthy actors. That being said, I loved this movie. Great story, great action. I am former military and have worked in the Special Ops community so I hold a special place in my heart for these guys. Worth watching if you like military action flicks."
5,One of the best movies i have seen in the past year..,"This movie is up there in the same class of ""saving private ryan"". Make sure you watchit in a good player and stereo system so you can hear all the awesome battle scenes.I give it a five-star rating no doubt. Gave me a feeling that people give their lives away so you and i cansit home enjoy our family and freedom. Two thumbs up! Let the rest of world know that weas Americans are not too be messed with! We will kill u three times before you even know weare there!"
5,awesome watch,I had been looking for a new watch for a few years. It ended up being between this and a Tag. I decided that I didn't want to spend over $1000 on a watch so I went with this one. Great quality and a bonus that I will never have to replace a battery. Looks great too! Highly recommended.
5,An Excellent CD,"Dany Brillant is one of the most popular artists in France today. His albums are all simply fantastic. However, this one is special in that it is a live performance. In the liner notes, Dany Brillant states that he hesitated before making this recording, because this type of performance is best enjoyed live, in concert. Because this is a live recording, the musicians all give it everything they've got! It's exciting, to say the least. This album includes many of Dany Brillant's greatest hits, including his first hit single, ""Suzette"" and the lively, ""Ca l'fait"". It is a must for Dany Brillant fans, as well as lovers of French music and jazz.Merci, Dany Brillant!"
4,Saved me some $!,"I'm so glad I was able to buy this book this cheap instead of paying $30+ at my campus bookstore. I don't even have to use it much, so that was smart to purchase it off here."
3,Disney Haunted Mansion Clue Game--Meh,"As a first-time player of Clue in general, I found that for such a seemingly simple concept, it had WAY too many damned rules. It took us over 15 minutes to read the instructions, and even after we took the time to do so, the instructions made no sense.Overall, it was not a very exciting game. Perhaps it had something to do with the fact that we were a large group (9-10), but it was nothing to write home about in general.The Disney aspect doesn't add anything to the game itself, also."
4,Meta Cooler,Cooler returns and lands on namek and starts killing then goku pikkolo vigeta etc go to namek 2 to find cooler in a metal suit and pikolo destroys the robots while goku and vigeta fight meta cooler right before cooler lunches his attack vieta goes ss and with both of them ss they kill meta cooler.
2,Less than great,So far of all my dragonball DVDs this is my least favoriteit's short Like the rest of them but I can not get into itthis movie is not that important so I would skip it.
3,Customer Service in Health Care,"So far so good, I have not yet finished this book, but so far it is a good read - very readable, and easy to read with clear messages. It is US centric, and focussed on the US healthcare system which is not always relevant to the UK system but nevertheless has some messages that are transferable."
1,Star inflation alert,"William E. Burns has a habit of reviewing his own books. He awards himself five stars. This is blatant self-promotion on his part. His book is too short to be called an encyclopedia. Like other books in the publisher's History of Science series, it is aimed squarely at school and public libraries. Students looking for biographical entries would do better to consult the Dictionary of Scientific Biography. A real encyclopedia, like the Encyclopaedia Britannica, would be better for most other purposes. In short, I do not see any need for Burns's book."
5,D-Link DFE-530TX+ Ethernet Adapter,"Have had several in operation on XP, M.E., and 98 SE computers. Have been mostly trouble free, small problems worked out with assistance of helpfull phone staff. User's guide is somewhat confusing, On page 17, under title ""Software Installation"" directs you to the ""READ ME"" file on root directory of installation diskette, of course there is no readme file there. But, well, nobody's perfect."
2,Didn't get under my skin at all ...,"Ashes in the wind"" was my second Woodiwiss, after The flame and the flower"". So I had great expectations, hoping for another unique story and adorable couple, and then I was very disappointed. The story was improbable and I didn't like Alaina at all - she was so stubborn and non-amiable, I don't understand how Cole could love her. My message to all romance readers: Skip this one and read Shanna"" or A rose in winter"" for example."
4,Not top quality but very touching,I didn't think this was one of Woodiwiss' best but I did enjoy it. The bickering htat went on between Alania and Cole was to drawn out like a bunch of three year olds. However once they got over it and before they were hitched I really enjoyed the action and mystery that kept you going for more
5,Great CD!,"I actually bought this CD in Nassau, wanting some of that island music that I could listen to when at home. I bought it not knowing if I would like it or not. To my surprise I LOVE it. Its great for parties too. The songs are very up beat, and fun, and after the rum starts flowing so does the dancing."
3,More fun for grownups than for kids,"This toy is cute, but probably more fun for grown-ups who get a kick out hearing Eeyore talk. The number of things he says is too limited to be entertaining to a child for long."
4,"A nice compliment to the Pooh, Tigger, and Piglet ""Ask Me""'s","Eeyore is surprisingly engaging and easier to play with than several of the other ""Ask Me"" toys for my 1 year old son. The bobbing head and the waggling ears make him squel with delight almost every time Eeyore speaks. Batteries have lasted a long time and the mechanism seems to keep on working even after repeated hugs during its operation that make me wonder if the gears will strip but they don't!"
2,Wrong version,"I ordered this thinking it matched the description, which was Stars on Long Play 1 with the Beatles music. I got Stars on Long Play 3 with the Rolling Stones music. I was rather disappointed because I bought this for my dad for Christmas and he already owns this version."
3,Not a bad word to say...,I saw Steve play at a local pub in Beverly which is near Hull and in England if you still dont know and it was great a really good atmosphere so bought the cd they where selling at the back and liked it. He is a very good guitarist and has the same unique sound and style live and is defiantley an un-noticed genius so buy it if you like folk spiced up with other genres along with one of my personal favourites latin.
4,Hidden Treasure,"I happen to come across this CD looking for something else. I forget what I was looking for, N E way, I put the Cd in the car on the drive home, and was blown away by this cat. I've since turned on a few of my Neo-soul, urban-blues, old school R & B buddies, and all have given the dude crazy props. If Ya Ain't Heard. NOW ya have, cope this joint, you wont be mad at me"
5,The ideal Chanel Allure balm.,"The Chanel Allure balm is the most satisfying balm I know. It makes your skin smooth after you have been using an aftershave lotion too long. Know what your skin can realy feel like in softness, no stinging, no itching ... just satisfying balm ! Thank you Chanel."
1,Misleding,"I ordered a ""Sharp Electronics...Projector Lamp"" and expected it to be a genuine Sharp product. A generic substitute was shipped. I could have purchased a generic product for a lesser price but chose to go with a Sharp brand. I'm disappointed with this form of business ethics and will not order from MrginMart again. Jim R"
4,Projector lamp life is just ok,"Projector lamp life is just ok, lamp is good, it's easy to install, but it only last about a year or year and a half with daily use of 2 to 2-1/2 hrs. It's supposed to last 4000 hours. It doesn't. I'm on my third or fourth lamp now."
2,beware,beware bulb look fine in packaging but after about 250 hours and 2 months later the bulb exploded inside the projector. The warrenty is only for 1 month so you are out of luck if the bulb blows in two months.
5,"Pop perfection, but beware.",This LP is perfection. The remastering is OVERTLY SUPERB. This LP is worth it's price. Did I mention the sound? (-: Beware of the bonus tracks. They aren't worth diddly.
1,WORST SERVICE EVER!!,"Amazon confirmed a correct order, but the publisher sent the wrong book!! Not only did it take longer than it should have, but they refused to refund my shipping expenses to have it sent back. OPOE books is the worst company I think I have ever dealt with... and I run a multi-million dollar restaurant. They are not friendly, not professional, and need to be put to stake if you ask me. The poorest business practices I have ever witnessed. They claimed that they would have sent a return shipping label, but neglected to mention that prior to my return... besides the fact it shouldn't matter. I'm sure they have an accounting department with a checkbook that could easily mail one payable to me for the expense I incurred do to their wrongdoing."
2,The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance,I have seen this movie a lot of times and this DVD is the only time that I did not hear the song sung by JEAN PITNEY. Maybe they forgot to add it when they made this DVD and it was very disapointing so that is why I only gave it 2 stars. Maybe you can look at this problem for me.A great moviethanks Noel.
1,Out of item,"Gohastings shipped the incorrect dvd's. When I called them they said they were ""out of stock"" of what I ordered, saying I could send it back and get a refund. Why not just send me an email saying they are out of stock and issuing an immediate refund?"
1,"would not buy, poor service","This looks great but when I ordered it, the pump was missing. Just like the other customers problem. The replacement they sent me also had the pump missing. Had to return both for refund. Very disappointed, they obviously don't care about customer satisfaction"
5,It's really good...,I really liked this product!!!! this may have your next option if you have the epilator already...it feels great in your skin...
4,It works!,I gave four stars because your legs don't stay stubble free for as long as they say it will but it does work wonderfully!
1,Disappointed!!!,"First of all,I decided to buy this product thanks to the excellent reviews. I bought this because my body hair grows very quick so I thought that this product would help me to slow the process; however it didn't do it at all. After applying this cream as the instructions suggested for more than four weeks, I didn't notice any change; in fact, the only thing I noticed was that I started having an ingrown hair problem. Additionally, I disliked the smell of this cream because it was as if I were using a type of hair salon product. Another bad thing was that when I received this product by mail some of it was poured in the box because the container wasn't complete sealed."
4,blood pressure kit,It is very convenient and easy to use. I like the case; it fits everything inside. It is very light and I use for travel with my patient.
4,Great Stuff- A must buy for athletes prone to injuries,"I injured my wrist during lifting a couple days ago and my dad had this in the house so i used it instead of the usual prewrap and tape method and i have to say its just amazing. Ive been able to take it off for showers and still use the same piece- no glue so it doesn't pull off hair. it looks to me that its coated with a rubber that just sticks against itself. Its a little disgusting to think about, yes but its really breathable and Ive been able to just wash it off with water and it doesn't fall apart."
5,Awesome little Epilator,"This is the second Emjoi I have owned. My last one lasted for years and still works, but I wanted one that could be plugged in while shaving. I got tired of the charge running out before I was done with both my legs. Not with this one though. It's a little smaller than my original Emjoi, but doesn't seem to really make much of a difference. I will NEVER go back to shaving, I use this bad boy once a week. It's just so nice not to have to shave in the shower every day. I must have a high tollerance for pain as it has never bothered me except a little in the bikini area. The best time to use it is right after you shower because your leg hairs are sticking straight up making it easier to get them all. Oh the best part, no more rash/bumps in the bikini area since using my emjoi, nothing else ever worked, I always had bumps! If you hate shaving like most of us do, than this is a must an investment you will not be sorry you made."
5,Gave me the guidance I needed,"I am always writing on my job and sometimes I just didn't know who to start on certain types of documents. However, this book helped me a lot. Now at least I have the steps and guidance of this book to help me."
5,Loves it!,We got this one for our sons birthday since he got the projector for Christmas! He loves it....and the many other ones he has. The fact that there is sound is a big deal for him and it is easy enough for him to work it by himself. He goes into his room turns off the lights and is there for a while!
3,"Good for younger kids, not so helpful for teenagers","This book had a lot of great ideas for working with younger kids, but now that our child is 16, the ideas were not very helpful"
2,Poor instruction but a wide variety of problems,I've worked through all three of the books that I could find that were either exclusively or mostly devoted to covering the analytic questions. This was the worst as far as the instruction goes and explanation. The only reason I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 was that it had a wide variety of problem types-- probably much more wide than will be on the test.
1,GRE LSAT Logic Workbook,Do not buy this book. This was completely useless. Instead by the book with 10 real LSATs as this was much more worth my time.
1,ilive IHM8816DT DVD Home Music System,"This system is OK for the younger children for their first stereo system. However for the young adults and those that have experienced the better stereo systems sounds this is not the unit for you. The price range is acceptable for what you get, but is something I will pass on to my great nephew."
4,Pleasantly pleased,"I bought this for my daughter and I am pleasantly surprised with the sound and functions of this stereo. She wanted it mostly as an ipod docking station, but it works well as a clock/stereo/dvd/cd player. Had no trouble getting the functions set up and working. So far so good!"
5,ILIVE,These were a hit on Christmas morning. These speakers are not only speakers but DVD players as well. Very versitle items! They play well both with the iPod and without. Great for teens or preteens!
1,Poor Quality; Poor Craftmanship,"I bought this item new, but it arrived with a few scratches. I was willing to give it a try anyway. The quality is crap-cheap plastic and particle board- and the stereo kept turning itself off when playing dvds and when listening to the ipod. I will never buy this brand again, rather spend a few extras bucks and invest in something of known quality!"
4,Pretty good,This CD has alot of great music on it. The music on some of the tracks is a little funny but it is still a great cd. you should buy it!
5,switching from plastic to this was unreal!,"ive always used a plastic cutting board, and this bamboo board was an eye opener. cutlery does not skip and dance over the surface, and food doesnt move around at all. highly recommend it!"
4,Good (but not in Spanish audio track),"It is funny indeed. However, the Spanish audio track is no good, as they put the Spanish audio directly on top of the Russian audio, so you hear both, and it isn't dubbed -- one guy reads all the Spanish translation (so there is never any female voices in Spanish)."
4,Autumn Marathon,"Russian with English subtitles. The translator called it ""a sad comedy."" Works for me. A humorous look at adultery with a serious undertone about how indecisiveness might be more painful than just breaking somebody's heart outright. Hey, it's Russian. You know they can't do anything, not even slapstick, without literary undertones. That's why we love them. Great writing plus an extremely talented cast equals another keeper."
1,"Can't say, I NEVER got it.","I really looked forward to this ring but after over a month of no product, no customer service, and no money, I gave up waiting. I bet the ring is beautiful, but I wouldn't know. I do know that I will NEVER order from Silvermoon Jewelry ever again. I recommend that you don't either. I know shipments can get lost but the fact that they have not answered a single one of my numerous e-mails shows what a terrible business this is. I would rate 0 stars, but this isn't possible."
3,"Not bad, but not great.","Brandon Peterson's artwork is great and justifies the price of this book alone. The story, however, left me a little bit wanting. I loved Straczynski's runs on both Spider-man and Thor, but he seemed to miss the mark a little bit here. It's not horribly written. I just think he's capable of coming up with something a little more original. It expands a bit on Doctor Strange's original origin, but seems to rely a little to heavily on influences from the Matrix. The second movie seemed to come to mind the most while I was reading this. All in all, I would say it's a good read, just don't spend too much money on it."
3,Febreze Bionaire,"Item was purchased as a gift, recepient liked the product and used it for awhile then said it was to much trouble to fool with and that it always needed expensive refills. Product worked fine just not very pratical or cost efficient."
4,Love this machine,"I bought the Scentstories about a year ago. I love how easy it is to use and how wonderful the smells are. It is very quiet too. A great plus since mine is in my living/dining room. I really like the fact that I can have 3 levels of scent. If one of my friends decide to come over with her puppies, I can turn it up and not worry about their smell. The different scents are great too. I just wish their were more to choose from. The discs last a long time as well. I thought at first I would be spending a fortune on the discs but I have had one of my favorite discs for about 2 1/2 months and it still smells as fresh as it was the day I bought it. Although, sometimes the discs are hard to get out at times. I also like that if I am going somewhere I can shut it off and it turns the disc so that it is not ""wasting"" the smell when I am not home. It is a wonderful product and I would recommend it to any of my friends."
5,I would recommend the Febreze Scentstories.,"I really like the Febreze Scentstories. I own 2 now. It's great in the bedroom, and livingroom. It has a fragrance that is light, and can be turned on or off at anytime you want. You buy the fragrance you like, and change it anytime you want also."
4,Very cool way to freshen your winter-sealed home!!!,"I can cope with clutter but not odors. When you can't open the windows, things can funkify quickly. A friend who has one of these (and a stinky dog) recommended it and so I picked one up on sale. Got it going, walked away to take care of some stuff, came back and -wow- did it smell nice. And not just the room - the whole first floor of my home. It actually made me smile. The plug-ins that I used to use, besides being expensive over time, do not freshen nearly as well as this.This product exceeded my expectations. I highly reccomend it."
3,Hot but slow!!!,"If you are looking for good looking woman is a good DVD, you wont find any hardcore here, honestly beside the hot girls I found this DVD really boring. you really should save your money for something else.Every man's fantasy, a nurse? a high school girl? dominatrix? a secretary?? no... you wont find any of them here, the maid is ok though. so its up to you"
5,Great!,Great set! Bought this to go with the retro kitchen and this has been the perfect addition. Had it several years now and its held up to rough and tough use by 2 boys so I'd say it was money well spent!
4,"Cute, but cautious!","Gift for granddaughters for their kitchen set. Wanted realistic looking appliances...this IS realistic, but am alittle worried about how long it will last. My granddaughters LOVED it! The ""toast"" pops up; they filled the teakettle with water and we all had ""tea"" right away! So, it's a lot of fun! We'll just have to see how long it lasts- made of plastic-like material."
3,OK,"Not exactly what I expected for $15. Just a vinyl graphic over a piece of clear plastic. Not very durable, was expecting it to be metal."
4,Ok for the price,This camera is ok for the price you are paying. Actually images are good if there is enough light hence good for outside photography. But it is really bad for inside where you don't have enough light. Flash is not so powerful as it is powered by only two AA batteries as compared to other cameras which is powered by 4 AA or company's lithium batteries.But I would say one of the best in the price range.
5,Great Camera!,I actually bought this camera for my daughter. It was a replacement for another camera (not Kodak) that was damaged. She absolutely LOVES IT! Great camera for a great price!
1,Terrible,I got this for my birthday from my parents. Two words: IT SUCKS. Pictures look like they are 1MP. I would recommend the Toshiba X400 or X416. Link:Camileo X400 Camcorder
3,Very Brief Extracts,"You should be aware that this ""reader"" offers extracts from 83 works in only 191 pages (the Amazon description as of 7/24/00 giving the page count as 400 is wrong); most works are represented through passages that are only a page or so in length. If you are expecting an anthology, you will be disappointed. If you are looking for a text that compiles brief passages relevant to the theme of literature and religion from a wide range of sources, this book will serve your needs."
3,Not for potable water?,"It says this is for water in the description, but when I received it there is a State of California warning for lead content within the internal brass pump mechanism. I assume by this it's not particularly safe to use for drinking water. Another bummer is that the threads that the spout attaches to are not standard 3/4 inch garden hose - seems they are 7/8 inch. This means I can't attach a garden hose, RV-style water filter, etc. - at least not without some modification. When is someone going to make a nice drinking water safe rotary or lever pump that can pump at least a pint per revolution/pump that doesn't cost more than my emergency water storage barrel?"
5,Hold it together,Works well to keep the disk brakes on my Electrathon Race Vehicle . the Electrathon race vehicle uses bycycle wheels to reduce weight. Need good stopping action of which the disk brakes work best. These screws contain locking material on the threads to ensure I do not loose them during the race.
2,Dressage Exercises,"Yes there are 101 excercises, but no instruction on weight distribution and rein contact. It is mearly a list of things to do such that on a sleepless night I could come up with the same patterns. I would use it for ideas in a class so that I could keep things fresh."
3,Learn how to write,"This book is chock full of the syntactic ambiguities which make relatively simple concepts, such as MBR, difficult to explore.e.g. ""That is, 80 percent of the codes assigned by MBR were correct, but the cost was that 28 percent of the codes assigned were incorrect.""Luckily, there's a picture explaining the mess.The ideas are here, but Berry and Linoff need to hire a real writer. I guess, smart folks like these guys have a tough time communicating with the common man?- Merv"
5,Great Approach to DM Mixing Business topics w/ DM techniques,"It looks to me as a good book, because it mixes the strategic approach with data mining techniques. It begins defining what Data Mining is, main tasks, Data Mining stages and then it follows with techniques.The best is that there is some chapters that covers the same topics but one with theoretical approach and the next with examples for those previous topics. You really understand what this is about.This is specially great for non native english speakers as me. (spanish) I guess it requires some statistical knowledge and some systems modeling too. If readers forgot something about probabilities, hypothesis tests, etc... i recomend having some statistical book next to you. I guess is a good book for business college students as me, getting involved in this matter."
1,Too many words and little content,"This book is very difficult to read. The authors say very little in hundreds of pages. I was looking for more content. The data mining techniques are explained in detail, but they are very difficult to understand. Perhaps this could also be because I am new to data mining. This is definitely not a book for someone looking for a quick introduction to data mining."
1,Worthless Product,"This pedometer did not work at all for me. The first time I tried it, I counted my own steps -- I took 800 and it recorded 28. The next time, I took 500 and it recorded 23. It was more accurate when I just held it in my hand. I put it in my desk drawer, and it recorded over 900 steps just from me opening and closing the drawer."
4,Walk across campus,Bought 15 pieces of this product and all persons using are all happy with the product
1,Died in a few weeks,The pedometer worked okay for a weeks and then just died. It is very simple so there is no good reason for it to completely stop working. There is no way to fix it as the unit is enclosed so I had to just throw it away. Buy a different brand!
5,As accurate as possible,"It's nice to have a simple, very easy to use pedometer. This one accurately counts steps. There are no fancy features, which are unnecessary for one who simply wants to get 10,000 steps per day."
4,Works great most of the time,"The Accusplit AE120XL works great most of the time. I have been using it about 3 weeks and most days it records the number of steps pretty accurately. There have been a few days where it has only recorded a couple of hundred steps and I have not figured out why since I have always worn it in the same location. I am trying to make a habit of checking the reading throughout the day to make sure that it is recording steps properly. Very easy to use. The display is easy to read. The security leash is a nice feature. The cover is very easy to open if the device is attached to your pants/clothing. Otherwise, the cover is very difficult to open. Overall, this is a good product and I would recommend it over most of the other pedometers on the market today."
3,"Low-tech, high times","Sure the film is lacking in visual and audio clarity, but the performances, writing and attitude are top-notch and original. Great little cult comedy. They should remake it with a bigger budget in fact."
5,Black cherry blues,This is one of the best Burke novels of all. it captures the feel of Lousiana perfectly. This book is well worth your time.
2,"Burke Book, Black Cherry Blues","Within a few pages of reading this book, pages started falling out. The publisher needs to use better quality products.However, I am enjoying the novel."
1,Terrible toy,"I bought this for Christmas for my godchild. The description is so wrong! It is horrible, my godchild is still in tears she hates it so much, it looks real, but not really. She can't do anything with it. It is not REAL. The description needs to say, FOR SHOW ONLY. Very sad."
2,hmmm,"I took a look at a craigslist ad some guy had for sale. The sides of this wok are WAY TOO LOW. I'd be scared to cook stuff in it and have the food or oil fly out all over the place. I also like to use my wok for boiling spaghetti and other stuff but the sides are so low it almost seems like more of a frying pan than a wok. If this is the same model, then I'll pass on getting it."
5,Loved It,"I have always loved Neil Young's music. Takes me back, but still the music is as great today as it was in my youth."
5,Brings me back to the 70's,"I'm really glad that I made this purchase, this CD brings me back to the 70's, and alot of good memories. I had forgotten how much I liked Neil Youngs songs, until I got this CD. On a warm spring or summer day, with the top down on the car.........this music makes the whole day seem complete."
2,Old Mr. Young,"I am a longgggg time fan of Neil Youngs, back to the days before he didn't write Horse With No Name. But this collection is sooo uninteresting. Each song has it's merits, (despite the fact I personally hate Southern Man and Ohio). But Mr. Young's music is about feelings and attitude and revolution and this set is so predictable and contrived. Buy the original album collections or wait until a box set does justice to the depth of his work. (Or buy Decade if you need just some of these songs, (for your iPod?).) This is too much like what the first Jackson Browne greatest hits collection was, quick money for non-fans."
5,Water shooter is great alternative to squirt guns!!,"This water shooter can really shoot over 30 feet, but since the child controls the speed and distance that the water is shot, it can also shoot a gentle stream only a few feet. My kids, ages 4 & 9, have a blast with them and I like that they can ""shoot"" water without using a toy gun. We've had ours for over a year and they still look brand new and work as well as the day we got them."
3,Good beginner boxes,"While this book has some nice models, after folding Tomoko Fuse's boxes (bothOrigami Boxesand Fabulous Origami BoxesFabulous Origami Boxes) it is a bit of a letdown.The boxes are not as intricate as Fuse's. However, they are easier to fold and could probably be folded by children a lot easier than Fuse's. If you love boxes, as I do, it is still worth buying. If you have not used Fuse's books, I recommend you buy them first."
1,Just get the more expensive one,"Everytime I take a temp I get a different reading. Even in the same ear within 6 seconds. And not just a couple of tenths of degrees, full 5-6 degree difference. This product is crap and I am returning it."
3,Radio Spots,"Here's a list of the radio spots on this DVD: Fugitive Girls, The People Next Door, Secret Ninja, Black Cleopatra/Trader Hornee/ Gun Girls, The Boogey Man, and The Black Connection."
3,"Good, but not Great","I had recorded a session off Fit TV with Petra Kolber and really loved her energy and enthusiasm, and the session I recorded had GREAT music. This DVD is good, but is truly for beginners. If you're just starting to exercise, you will probably like this a lot because she tells you everything she's going to do before she does it, which makes it really easy to follow from the get-go. I've been exercising to walk or dance DVD's for years and it was just a little too simple for me, with very routine steps that I've done a million times, plus the music was just so-so. I still love Petra though!"
5,Cardio for Beginners,I have used this excercise DVD a couple of times while I am traveling. I like the 20 minute length with options of shorter and longer workouts. It got me working up a bit of a sweat. Good for when you want to get moving!
5,Just what I was looking for!,"I am 45 Busy Mom & working full time. Needless to say, I put everyone before myself and it has caught up with me. Recent issues with blood pressure and ""stuff"" made me realize I need to take better care of myself. I used to do Arobics years ago & loved it. Living in Arizona I become a hermit in the summer time and this DVD gets me going after I get home from work. There are 4 different workouts, 2 ten minute ones & 2 twenty minute ones. After 2 weeks I am doing the 20 minute ones. I love it! Petra is very motivating, I know it sounds silly, but, it is like she & the other girls are right there with me. I am not bored with it at all!! I really like the 5 minute stretch at the end. I know I will end up doing 2 twenty minute workouts back to back one of these days. I am sticking with it, no problem. I highly recommend this DVD if it has been a while since you have worked out. I know it will help you get back on track to a better you. Nobody else will do it for you."
2,O Que?????,"Some of the cuts listed on this page are indeed great, but unfortunately, they are not included in this set. My Brazilian Beats set contains 3 CDs of generic electronic drum-n-base by unknown artists, with none of the songs listed on this page on the CDs. Other than the content, the CD looks identical to the one pictured, and has the holographic sticker, so it is not a bootleg. Before you buy this set, ask the seller what is on the CDs!"
1,Not an Energizer,Sold and pictured as an Energizer Battery. Came in as a GP. So why don't they have a picture as a GP if that is what they are passing out. Has to be some false advertising going on there. Suprised Amazon and Engergizer hasn't spoke up about it since I now see I am not the only one to complain about it. The label on the outside of the envelop even indicates an energizer. Now the concern is how long will the GP last. You don't see GP commercials advertising they keep going and going. So time will tell.
1,Don't buy this book!,"The biggest complaint that I have with this book is that the answers explained are horrible. They are either useless or only confuse you more. I would highly recommend you to buy the REA(Research & Education Association) Review Book if you can find it. The REA Review book had an answers explained section that is quite helpful, not only telling you why an answer is right, but why each wrong answer is wrong. I have also found the test questions to be much more difficult and confusing in this book than any review book I got and from the actual exam that I just took. I also found many blatant errors in this review book. For example numbers 44 and 60 on exam I have typos in their answer choices. The back of the book is different from the answer choice. There are many others that I found and probably many more that I did not find. I am rather sorry that I wasted my money on this book and urge you not to do so as well."
4,"Fine for money, nothing special","I bought this throw (in green) because it was $12.99. It's definitely worth that price and I don't regret it. But it isn't a fabulous or remarkble throw in any way. It's fine for the money, but it's nothing special... it isn't amazingly soft or beautiful for example. I don't know that I'd spend $19.99 on it and I definitely wouldn't spend more than that.PROS:- Nice size, does cover from toe to chin- Warm- Fairly attractive- Fairly softCONS:- Not very soft. I don't mean it's scratchy at all... but compared to a fleece, microfiber, or fine knit... it isn't soft at all.- Not tremendously attractive. I have suede couches so it goes well with them in that sense... but it isn't what I would call beautiful. It looks a bit like the top half of a sleeping bag.To sum up: I've owned nicer, but for this price I'm glad I bought this."
3,Lovely and soft,Bought for my mother. She really likes it. Only negative comment is that it is a bit small.
4,"A bit Small, But awsome Desighn","This is a High Quality Blanket,Worth the buy,'its a bit small though, so its more decrerative, then a full on conforter"
4,warm n comfy,"The throw is small, but covers you well enough. It's nice and warm and really soft, and the color is exactly what I expected. For the price, it's perfect!"
5,COULD NOT GIVE IT AWAY,"I PURCHASED THREE OF THESE TO GIVE AS GIFTS BUT WHEN I RECEIVED THEM AND FELT HOW SOFT THEY WERE I PULLED ONE RIGHT OUT OF THE PACKAGE AND KEPT IT FOR MYSELF, I THEN DECIDED TO KEEP THE OTHER TWO, I WISH THEY WERE LARGER BUT THEY ARE A THROW NOT A BLANKET, I WAS VERY HAPPY WITH THE QUALITY AND THE COLOR, I JUST COULD NOT GIVE THEM AWAY BUT I DID FORCE MYSELF TO PURCHASE THREE MORE AND MY SISTERS WERE PLEASED WITH THE BLANKETS ALSO"
3,Warm blanket but small,"The blanket kept me warm enough while I was watching TV or reading a book, but I wish both sides of the blanket were made of the soft fleece material. It would make it warmer and more comfortable. I also thought it would be heavier.Not bad for the discounted price I received but I would not pay full price for this item ($20).Next winter I will look for something that is a little more substantial."
4,Nice.,"I bought this after reading the reviews and am pleased although its not exactly what I expected. Its fairly soft, but not as soft as fleece or some other blankets. It is a suede-like material. But it is thicker than I expected, with some sort of fill. It has been very popular now the days are colder. It seems sturdy, which is also nice."
5,"Holy moly, this thing is warm","I got this throw thinking it would be more about texture and appearance than function, but boy was I wrong. I've been using it as a top layer blanket in bed, and I haven't had to turn on the space heater once. It's extremely comfy and works great by itself as a throw, but it definitely proves its worth on those 5F nights. Even if you're only thinking of a just-in-case blanket, this one is your guy."
1,This flashlight sucks,This flashlight sucks. It isn't very bright at all. DON'T BUY THIS FLASHLIGHT.
1,No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency,"So disappointed. On Disk 2 - #4, The Boy With the African Heart freezes and cannot be fast-forwardedthe first 10 or so minutes; everytime Also, On Disc 3 - #7 A Real Botswana Diamond which is the last one does the same but maybe 15 minutes!!Most would say,""at that price, st least you got something'.) I say. ""whatever the price I don't expect or anticipate a damaged product."""
4,Enjoyed the books...,The videos are similar to the novels. They were quick & engaging reads; the videos are a way to spend a few hours on a dreary day.
2,Not as great as it seems,"I bought this to go on top of our Thomas the Tank Engine table. The packaging stated that it fits onto the table. Hmmm while it is small enough to go onto the table, it is too small for the table leaving exposed areas. It is also very bulky. The tracks buckle on top of the mat all the time and this seems to frusterate my 3 year old.My son plays with this table almost every day and since we have put this on he wants nothing to do with it. The sounds do not seem to interest him as much as the individual items, such as the mountain tunnel, sounds do.In my opinion I do not think this is worth the money."
4,Sensational Sodor Playmat,Its so cute. the details are great for my 3 year old son. The noises are a nice addition. Much more durable than I expect. Very pleased with the purchase.
1,Terrible Tray,"I loved the Bumbo seat as did my 6 month old daughter. I originally wanted the Bebe Pod because of the tray, but it wasn't available when I purchased the Bumbo. I bought the tray for the Bumbo and took it back the same day. It doesn't stay on at all and when my daughter would lean on it, the sides would come up and down and pinch her skin! Babies R Us had the new Bebe Pod with tray. I purchased it and couldn't be happier. She loves the toy that comes with it and the tray stays in place. She also sits much better in the Pod because her legs can bend at the knees and not shoot straight out like in the Bumbo. Spend the money on a Bebe Pod, it ends up costing the same as a Bumbo since you have to buy the tray seperate anyway."
2,Good in theory...,"I was really excited to receive this from Target (via Amazon) in the mail (arrived in a week, not to bad!) and since my baby has a bad habit of dropping his toys to the floor where he can no longer reach them, thought this would be great.Well... it's good when he's in a good mood, not squirming, and not upset. Once he decides he no longer wants to be in the seat, he starts to arch his back, and the try pops/slides off, but not before pinching my son's leg first.If it didn't cost 1/2 as much as the original cost to send it back to Amazon - I would...Really mom's take my word on this: Bumbo seat = GREAT! Tray for Bumbo, waste of time and money."
3,Bumbo is useless without the tray,"I wish I bought this when my son first started to use the Bumbo. He hated it without the tray and just wanted to get out. I can put toys on it and he can play with it. It didn't take him too long to figure out how to pull the tray off. The tray is hard to get on, and comes off very easily. A 6 month old will not want to stay in it very long, and will be able to get the tray off. I guess this might work for a 3-4 month old if they can sit well enough in the Bumbo. We handed it down to our 3 month old nephew."
3,Not a bad idea,It is convenient to use with the Bumbo chair. We bought the Bumbo tray to see us through with our 4 month old until our 18 month old is ready for a booster seat at the main table. It is a much cheaper alternative to buying another expensive high chair. The only problem we have seen is that it can be hard to install. It certainly requires two hands... not necessarily something you have available when you have more than one child at meal time.
4,"Great addition, if you can get it attached.","We love the bumbo, and saw this tray for it on-line (couldn't find in any store). We thought sine we liked the bumbo so much, this had to be designed just as well. Unfortunately, it's not. It's difficult to secure, especially when the baby is moving around, as they tend to do. After a couple of weeks, I've figured out a process to secure one side, the middle section, and then push in the other side so it attaches. Once it's on, though, it's great, and stays on. It helps keep the table clean and the tray is a good size for our 10 month old. Overall, I recommend it, if you can handle getting it attached."
1,A great work of fiction!,"Did Thomas Weisser actually watch any of these movies before writing about them? I find that hard to believe as I've managed to track down a lot of these films, only to find them completely different than his reviews. Weisser's never had much credibility - this just continues to add to his legend."
5,"""messed up typo""","""a very good book. The origins of the Portuguese are CELTIC, ROMAN, VISIGOTH, SUEBIAN, but NOT ARAB!!!!!!!!Only a few arabs and berbers went into the muslim invasion of spain in the 7th century. The rulers were these two peoples and not much or any intermingling occured between these invaders and the EUROPEAN inhabitants of Iberia.A good work on an historical person."
5,"Great book, but don't take this one to the beach !!","Mr. Russell's book is superb in many ways: the prose is very elegant, even to a French speaking reader, the author's erudition is impressive and any amateur historian will find here a fascinating introduction to a side of European history which he or she is most unlikely to have been familiar with prior to acquiring Mr. Russell's book. That ""the navigator"" hardly ever set foot on a ship of any kind, I must confess I didn't know! His cupidity, pettiness in certain ways and magnanimity in other are very intriguing. The context is beautifully described. In other words, here is a splendid book by a very gifted historian. One word of caution, though: this is not an easy read! Don't take Mr. Russell's book to the beach after a stressful few months at the office. It takes a relaxed and attentive mind to really enjoy the book. I read it whilst in a yoga camp on a carrot juice fast. Both were perfect!"
1,Not easy to use,I brought this at the beginning of my weight loss journey. I found it hard to use and it didn't turn to the other settings easily. I hate it. I through it out. Waste of my money.
4,Easy to use,I purchased my pedometer a few weeks ago and it was easy to set up and use. It seems accurate and I like the additional clip for keeping it secure on my waistband. My only inconvenience is that it's slow to respond when I want to reset it.
2,Too Diffucult To Set Up,I purchased several pedometers to try out before launching a corporate walking program. This one was too difficult to set up. I still to this day haven't figured it out.
5,everclear's best work yet,"i just got out of the whole teeny bopper music fad & wanted something w/ more... flavor. i heard the song ""wonderful"" & wanted to buy the CD. after the first song i new i was in love! this band has been through everything from drugs, broken homes to parenthood and marrige so they obviously have stuff to say. i love the feel of the music because its the kind of CD that you dont skip over songs. you have to listen to whole thing because it tells a story. even if you've never heard any of their other CD's (like me) you'll love this one and you'll find yourself buying all their others. i bought this CD a couple months after it came out and i now own 2 more of everclear's albums, but i still think this was the best. all i can say is this is a great CD and i could just go on and on about it. on a scale of 10 being the best- its better than an 12."
4,cool collection,"The book has examples of various different styles of calligraphy from a bunch of artists. It also has photos of ""applied examples"". My only gripe is the price -- the book seems like it's printed on unnecessarily heavy stock. I would've never paid retail for it. Price is the only thing keeping this from getting 5 stars."
3,Pricey and Average,"I found the Urban Calligraphy and Beyond to be an alright source of information on some ""tag"" style of graffiti and the sort of geometrical base for that type of artwork but I was expecting more actual type faces for reference. Lacking in sources of reference and the layout of book seems as though it is trying to be some what of a fine art book rather than a resource for typographic inspiration."
4,Good CM History,"You'll get insider information about Country Music when you read this biography of Porter. I thought there was a great deal of info about Dolly Parton here also, but then the two of them where such a big part of each others lives. If you like to know what went on behind the scenes that produced some of the great people and songs of Country Music, here's another book for you."
1,Kinesiology - healing during the journey of the Soul,"A great book that I have valued for many years, Ann Holdway touches on so many aspects that are incorporated in the work of a healer of energetics. In the early days of my practice I valued her words and applied some of the many aspects that she mentions in this very valuable book - for those on an enlightened path, the journey of the soul and those whose vibration is still searching for the right aspects to heal herself/himself and others this is a guided tour."
3,Too derivative to be believed,"Although I've not yet finished ""Last Castrato"", I've read enough to bemoan the author's lack of originality in his characters. The chief policemen are obviously based on P.D. James' Adam Dalgleish and on Detective Columbo, right down to the 'cast in his eye,' which, in Peter Falk's case, is an actual artificial eye. The punctuation is quirky, a pet peeve of mine, and the overwritten, arcane adjectives make me imagine the author as a repressed Victorian spinster, something like the owner of the pensione where our heroine lives.In spite of those flaws, I persist because of my fondness for the city of Florence, and the similarity of some of Cordelia's reactions to my own. Besides, how could a novel that features Firenze, opera, Italian food and murder most foul be all bad?"
3,"Farinelli, Cafarelli, & Broschi?","Hey, I enjoyed the book,OK. It bothered me that there was no explanation of the use of the names of real persons for several characters. All right, they're long dead, so probably don't care. Still it seemed there should be a forward, afterward or something. I stumbled onto this book after seeing the movie""Farinelli"", so was aware of the significance of the name of the most famous castrato of them all.And it was pretty clever having a guy named Broschi show up to kill off the bad guy. Farinelli was the stage name of Carlo Broschi. Recognizing the names of the old castrati, along with the book's title pretty much took all the mystery out of the story. Still, it would have been nice if the old guys got a little recognition at the end of the book"
4,Review,"Crystal and her brother, Cole never should have upset the town sorceress because now there turning into chickens. How will they ever stop pecking seeds and growing feathers?...."
2,"Chicken,Chicken is not very good...",Chicken Chicken is one of R.L Stine's weakest books.What's wrong with all of you?giving it 10 and over-rating it.It's quite boring really.The only good part is the end.
1,Don't Buy it - HP's Customer Service is a JOKE!,"I am happy with my digital camera, and bought the camera dock so I could use the rechargeable batteries that are supposed to last longer. The dock arrived in great shape, but the batteries were so low that the dock would not charge them. I got out my trusty owners manual, and the solution is 1) Go out and buy new batteries, or 2) go out and buy a battery charger. The DOCK was supposed to BE my BATTERY CHARGER! HP has no warranty card included, and no phone number to call to ask them to send new batteries. They hung up on me when I finally found the number on the Internet and called. They were not helpful at all, and the people I spoke to were complete jerks."
5,TIGER AND CRANE FISTS & KUNG POW,I RECOMEND KUNG POW BECAUSE IT'S PRETTY HILARIOUS.ESPECIALLY THE BAD GUY(BETTY) AND MASTER TANG AND LING AND THE CHOSEN ONE. IF YOU SEE THIS MOVIE YOU'LL LIKE IT BECAUSE IT CONTAINS PHYSICAL HUMOR AND IF YOU PAY ATTENTION TO WHAT THEY SAY IT WOULD BE VERY FUNNY. I LIKE IT SO MUCH I SEE IT EVERY DAY. I EVEN KNOW THE LINES ALREADY. AND TIGER AND CRANE FISTS I'VE NEVER SEEN IT BUT I ALREADY ORDERED IT HERE IN THIS WEB SITE. I RECOMEND YOU SEE BOTH OF THEM.
3,"ok, but not great--Barely a beauty book","First of all the cover fell off on the first day, but that was easily repaired with some glue.This book has some good recipes in it, but not nearly enough to be a beauty book. Many of the ingredients are hard to find unless you now where to look.There is a recipe for a sandalwood and tumeric mask and I warn anyone to make sure you rinse all of it off or you will have a yellow mess on all of you collars. Ask me how I now.The pregnancy chapter is unnessesary. If I wanted a pregnancy book I would have bought one.I wish the hair care chapter was longer. Indian women have such lovely hair.Which brings me to my biggest complaint. One would think that a book title Beauty Secrets of India would have pictures of Indian women in it. Most of the picture are of Caucasian women. The only picture of of Indian women is that of a dancer and a small picture of the author on the back flap!"
2,Not for beginners; teaching goes fast,"If you're a beginner, this might not be the video for you. Take a tip from the promo material, which says ""No time to exercise?"" What this means is that everything in the video is going to be compressed and quick, including the amount of time taken to teach movements. This video was my first foray into this kind of thing, and I found it to be a bit of a confidence-buster, because I couldn't follow the movements easily with the small amount of instruction given, at the pace at which it was given. That being said, if you're a natural at following movements, or if you have even a little bit of experience doing this kind of thing, you'd probably enjoy this video, and I think you'd get a good workout."
4,Excellent Quick Workout,"I have had this tape for more than 3 years,and these quick workoutsare ideal for people who like variety in their exercise routine.I usually do these exercise after a run on the treadmill"
4,Good starter,"It's a good starter for people looking for dance aerobic videos. I think after not too long, it will start to get too easy though."
3,quick work out,the dvd is pretty good but she shows through the moves quickly so the first couple of time you feel a little lost . but the 10minute interval go fast
4,Good workout,"Easy to follow, great work-out. I like how it's broken up into 10 minute segments for variety. Some of the segments take a couple times to learn but overall it's not too difficult."
3,Need some dance experience first,"This is not a good workout to just pick up and do. The combinations are taught quickly, so it is good if you practice several times before using it as your primary workout. I guess it would be ok for people who pick things up very quickly. Would also be best for people who are comfortable with moving their hips around (if you are stiff, the moves will be difficult for you)."
3,Just Okay,I have never used any of the 10 minute videos before and purchased several at once. Althought I have really enjoyed the Kickboxing and the Fitness ball ones I have not liked this one as much. I wanted something fun and different to introduce to my workouts but found this DVD a little hard to follow and hard for me to do since I have knee trouble. I didn't realize there would be such jumpy aerobic types of moves. Maybe it's better suited for a more coordinated person!
2,Not for beginners or non-dancers,"I'm getting back into exercising after about a 6 month hiatus, and I wanted to try something different other than just your average sit-ups and dumbbells exercise DVD. I'm a pretty shy person so I don't really dance, but I thought it would be fun to try this in the privacy of my own home. I have several of the other 10 Minute Solution DVDs and for the most part I really like them and get results. I didn't like this one much at all. I definitely wouldn't recommend it to any beginning exercisers. If you are a coordinated, ""dancy"" type person you might be able to keep up with this. I couldn't keep up and had to improvise a lot just to get in a good workout. I didn't love the instructor. She's quite small (as in short and thin) so she moves fast. I'm moving on to 10 Minute Solutions Latin Dance DVD."
4,Love it!,"I love this fitness video! It really gets my heart pumping because you have to keep up with her pace - which is manageable but a little bit of a challenge. Also, she is probably the least annoying fitness video personality. GREAT buy!Oh, the best part, even when I'm not in the mood to work out, once I do one I just want to continue and end up doing them all!"
2,Hard to believe but such a let down!,"I love Sherrilyn Kenyon and the DH novels so this book was very much anticipated.Wren is a great hero and the storyline was a good one. Wren just changes to quickly for me. All of a sudden he goes from being introvert to talking and in-love and it just did not ring true.For me, the characters did not have any depth. The story unfolded but I was not drawn into it!I found myself skimming over many pages just to finish.Maggie, as the herione just did not have a personality or anything about her that was beyond her 'description.'I think this series is over for me. The last book was not much better and I feel sad about it because I really liked the series at first.Also, I thought the complete turn around of a re-occurring character and family was not thought out very well.Unfortunately, the writing just is not what is could and should be."
3,"Good story, good lead female/male characters.","For once the female character was not completely annoying and the story was enjoyable with both characters being likeable. I found myself hoping the best for both of them, but as with most of her books, the ""God-like"" figure comes in at the end of the book and makes everything right. That is a bit annoying.Like the magic aspect of the books and the sex is getting less junior high which is nice. The story is fast paced and an easy read in general. I don't think this book has much impact on the series as a whole, but it was a nice read."
5,A great read.,"This was the first book in the Dark Hunter series I read. While most would see only the surface plot of Wren's problems, Maggie's transformation from a mouse into a strong confidant woman is what kept me rivited to the book.Some reviewers have said that the second half is a train wreck of character cameos and confusion. While I respect their opinion, I do disagree with it.Yes, there are a lot of characters and confusion in the last half of the book - if the reader is not paying attention. Each character's apperance is required and they are only present as long as needed."
5,Kenyon for the win!,"I realy enjoy this series, and always look foward to the next book coming out. She makes the characters come alive."
2,Juvenile action/adventure,"Save your money. This is by far one of Kenyon's worst books. I've read nearly all of her Dark Hunter books, and for the most part, they're entertaining reads, but nothing substantial and definitely nothing to make you think. She's hit a new low with Unleash the Night. While I liked Wren and Maggie and I wanted to enjoy the story, I was constantly thrown out of the story by the complete lack of any emotional intensity or any thought to actions or decisions. The characters make random decisions and you just can't see where they came to their conclusions except by plot device. The book was filled with cliches, triteness and complete and utter predictability. It's such a disappointment, because I want to like these books."
2,Disappoiintment,This book ended up being a big disappointment to me for I truly enjoyed the series. The first part of the book was good then it completely fell apart to me.I just could not see what Margarite saw in either the guy she was dating or in Wren. Wren if I remember right didn't speak that much if at all till toward the end of the book. Where as her DANCE WITH THE DEVIL to me was the best of the series that I read with the SINS OF THE NIGHT a close second.This was the last DH book I read.
4,Great Read!,"I have read most of Sherrilyn Kenyon's series about the Dark Hunters, and thoroughly enjoyed this book. It introduced a few new characters while evolving some of my favorites. I am interested to see what eventually happens to Nick, and Ash. Thank you for taking the time to read my review."
5,Loved it!,Bought this as a christmas gift for my mother in law and she absolutely loved it. She has been wearing this perfume for many years and has not been able to find it in stores and I was glad to find it on Amazon.
5,"Gordon Korman's ""Island"" series","What a page turner that keeps you guessing what is going to happen!!! Korman's trilogy has found a place in my classroom reading series. I've bought a classroom set of the whole entire ""Island"" series. I read each book in one day. It was nerve-racking waiting for the final book to come out, but I was NOT DISAPPOINTED.Who would have known that the ending would turn out as it did? The least likely islander came through and saved the day...by the skin of their teeth. I was gripped in the first book by the characters, the second by the separation of the kids and all of their problems. The third book kept me ""on the edge of me seat."" This has got to be turned into a big theatrical movie...I'll be the first in line to buy my tickets."
3,from a 56 year old retired teacher Gordon Korman fan,"I loved sharing Gordon Korman's books with my fifth grade class. In spite of the fact the early books were following a successful formula, they were successful. It ""cracked up"" the class including me. Even retired I keep many of his books. My classes and I particularly enjoyed I want to Go Home! and Who Is Bugs Potter? My personal favorite is No Coins Please! I was not sure what I would get into with this adventure trilogy. It was engrossing. I felt compelled to get and read the third book. However, I felt a sense of disappointment. Thinking it might be due to my personal expectations I loaned them to a great nephew to who I had previously loaned Korman books. He loved all the others, and he loved these also. I missed the creative twists and turns of his conniving little schemers, but the adventure is unmistakeably absorbing."
1,This Book IS NOT a GAME GUIDE,"If Your Looking for the Game Guide for GT 4 THIS ISN""T IT!! Product is Listed Wrong. It's Simply a Book on the Making of the Game(Who Cares?)."
5,One of my high school favorites,"15-year old Davey has just experienced the tragic loss of her beloved father via a robbery shooting. Her mother, unable to cope alone, accepts an offer of help from her sister-in-law, and thus Davey moves with her mother and younger brother from their home in Atlantic City to live with an aunt and uncle who are practically strangers to them in New Mexico. While there, Davey encounters unfamiliar rules, unexpected complications (eg, a friend's drinking problem), and some unlikely sources of support. As her mother deteriorates, Davey learns to cope with her own grief while at the same time negotiating the usual trials of being a high school student. A wonderful, moving book that would be especially appropriate for teens who have experienced a loss in their own lives."
4,i still enjoy it.,"after ten years, this is still a book i enjoy picking up. it reads light, but it is fast and emotionally true. edgy for a so-called ""kid's book""."
5,Beautiful CD,"I can't listen to this album anywhere. In the car, in the house, while i'm on the computer. It's great, all of the songs are timeless and have a deep meaning. Its amazing"
3,chaos princess,Diane so wholesome as a Georgia peach her hometown state. Music is pure and simple an she can belt out Don't Cry out LOud and do Miss Manchester proud.
1,DO NOT BUY THIS CD..it's full of crap,"this is the worst cd i've ever had...the voice is so badd, also the quality of the songs she put in her album...the songs are all bubblegum crap that makes you wanna throw up... i wouldn't be surprised if there's a headline in the newspaper about some people that commit suicide after listening to this album...trust me, the worst album everrr"
1,Will Hung sold more cd's!,"And that should tell you something. Are her fans tone death, delusional or both? Not sure but Diana's future is looking pretty cloudy in the music biz."
5,Powefull,"I bought this CD soley on the reviews from Amazon, and I wasn't dissapointed.In Europe nobody seems to know her and that;s really a shame. Het powerfull voice brings something new to the popscene. From the catchy posongs to the ballads witch I like most, especially ""Dreams""and ""Don't cry out loud"". Can't wait to hear her (hopefull) next album soon."
1,Really Sorry,But I do not think Diana is ready for anything except maybe a duet with Ashley Simpson. :( I hope she keeps practicing!
2,little baby doll,this is just ok I have listened to all the idols and I go way back to connie francis these people are just ok I heard a singer yesterday that really struck a note in my heart katharine mcphee thats more like it:
1,A New Fan,I am rating this low because I was just dissappointed. I was thumbing thru TV and heard this young lady sing beautifully I was in Walmart later and picked up the cd for my daughter. I decided to listen to find that song. That is the only thing on the cd. Trust me see her sing live. You can tell she can sing but the cd does not give her voice space to sound. Its about 3 songs that I listen 2 for 2 munutes.
2,Diana Not My Kind Of Music,this cd is not my kind of music so i was suprised when i like one song cardboard castles Diana i expected a bit more from her but she still did do a pretty good job so i give her 2 stars
1,Better luck next album,"This is an album just full of bubble-gum pop songs. If you actually hear music, don't buy this. And her little shrill in Go on and Cry is horrible.Better luck next time. If there is a next time."
4,Better Than Expected,"I was a wee little wary of this CD, but enjoyed Diana so much on A.I. that I thought it might be worth a listen. I wasn't disappointed, I was pleasantly surprised. The songs are all very catchy, and Diana does a great job of singing. He voice sounds warmer and more mature on this CD than it sounded on A.I. She is a terrific talent, and I hear that she is writing most of the songs on her next CD. Anyway, this is really a nice CD and a pleasure to listen to. It really leaves you in a cool happy mood."
1,My ears are bleeding!!!!,"This CD won't make it into the Top 50 on Billboard. She has bad material and her voice just sounds way green to be 1st Runner Up. She is not even in the same league as Clay, Kelly, Fantasia, Tamyra, Latoya, Jennifer or Ruben. She has potential though. Maybe her next project will fit her better. This one just plain sucks! There must be 2 DeGarmo cds out because it baffles me how anyone could give that piece of crap 5 stars.....but to each his own."
5,Amazing,"When you first saw her on American Idol, you probably thought, Oh No, not another sugary popstar like Hilary Duff. Well, with her debut album, she proves that stereotype wrong. Not only is Diana beautiful, she is amazingly talented. The songs on this album display her incredible range and diversity. The power of her voice is set to rival that of fellow american idol Kelly Clarkson. Diana definitely proves that she will be around for a long time."
3,Nice music,"This is a nice CD, but it wasn't quite what I had expected. I'm a big fan of Celtic Woman and Enya so I thought I would enjoy this CD more than I do. It's a little different than the Celtic music I'm used to listening to. Many of the songs don't seem like holiday songs, so you could play this CD all year long and it wouldn't seem out of place."
3,Just ok,It is not as stable as I was hoping for. It is a little warped. If I could do it over again I would not buy it for what I am using it for. (step)
5,Another Tool for My Physical Therapy,After using this with my physical therapist I decided to have this for my home use for continued health support. I've wanted this step for ages and now I was motivated & glad I purchased.
2,Would not buy again.,I thought it was regulation gym sized. It is much smaller. Disappointed. I would not buy this product again. I would spend $10 more dollars and get a larger sized step.
5,The more things change...,"Weird and Wonderful is a well researched and very readable account of the (mostly) 19th century phenomenon commonly known as dime museums. While they were themselves short-lived, the influence of dime museums extends far and wide throughout our culture - from Discovery Channel programming and blockbuster museum exhibits to freak show revivals and viral videos.The book should prove interesting to readers of American social history, and particularly enjoyable for museum and entertainment professionals."
5,Read This Book,"For those who insist on knowing, read this book. Rather than wasting your time with unimportant information, JC&I Are Wrong brings you what is most relevant to the subject."
1,Nice reviews by author,"An anti-religious polemic that is pretty predictable. In general the accusations are not too good, so the author makes up for that by putting them one after another, as if to make his case by number of accusations, rather than with a truly cogent argument.By the way, when you see a bunch of 5-star reviews, by reviewers WITHOUT the ""Real Name"" badge, and with one review each, you know that they were written by the author. So, obviously he doesn't have much faith in his book either. Heck, he didn't even want to put his name on the cover!Skip this book, it's low-grade twaddle, most likely written by a college student."
3,Good story---poorly written--where was the editor?,"The story is good, interesting look at Saudi, but extremely poorly written. Sounds more like Genia learned English and then forgot it when she went to the Middle East. Should use the benefits of an editor or proofreader to clean it up."
5,Enhanced with 30 black-and white photographs and 8 maps,"Enhanced with 30 black-and white photographs and 8 maps, Rivers Of Change: Trailing The Waterways Of Lewis & Clark by water resources consultant Tom Mullen introduces the reader to an American yesteryear of devastating floods, exploding steamboats, forced migrations, wandering rivers transforming thriving cities into deserted ghost towns, and wild rivers tamed into domesticated canals by dams and dredges. The focus is on a part of the Lewis and Clark route along the Missouri, Yellowstone, and Columbia rivers. This is a history that is enhanced with colorful characters, quirky historical anecdotes, and candid conversations ""from off the beaten trail"". Highly recommended as an addition to college and community library American History collections, Rivers Of Change will prove to be especially interesting to non-specialist general readers with an interest in environmental water issues -- past and present."
5,must read for those who is looking to change,"For those who are not christians, it may be difficult to try to accept the notions in the book. but even reading it purely from a secular angle, stripping out the religious connotations, it is an excellent book for those who want to find rapport for their feelings and excellent first step in understanding themselves in order to have faith that if they have the courage and will, they can change. I wish today's professionals have better understanding of this topic like Leanne Payne and would think twice before labelling someone to be a homosexual by birth or nature."
3,Could we achieve the same with NLP?,"(Some qualifiers/context: I am male, not gay, ambivalent about religion and otherwise reasonably ""normal"").I read the book trying to discount the strong Christian slant. What interested me most about the book is that the author effectively uses (currently) established NLP techniques during her sessions. Note that at the time of writing (1985) NLP was still in its infancy.The methods described use Jesus Christ as the primary resource in resolving issues about self-concept. This should be quite effective with Christians.The question is whether much the same could be achieved by the direct use of the appropriate NLP techniques. This will probably be much more acceptable to people who are less religious."
5,Classic Twain Poster,"I was visiting in Hannibal last summer and saw this poster in the gift shop at the Mark Twain Boyhood Home and Museum. As soon as I saw it, I knew this had to go on the wall in my classroom.The size is big enough to see, but not overpowering. (And I found a terrific black wooden poster frame at a store that rhymes with ""star net."") The image is very stately and is printed on high quality paper. Furthermore, I just love the quote:""The man who does not read good books has no advantage over the man who can't read them.""This is a classic. The poster speaks to my love of Mark Twain as my favorite author, as well as my love of books. This is staying on my wall until I retire--or they take me out feet first. VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED"
4,Does the job,This pack is great for medium to long runs. It doesn't leak and it snugs nicely to my back without bouncing. My one complaint is that the storage pocket is pretty small and its impossible to get to while wearing pack
5,Praying Prodigals Home,"This is an excellent book! It is filled with story after story of succesful intercessory prayer that brought prodigals home. I bought this book after watching my son go through a major battle with drugs and alcohol. I was at my wits end and felt desperate and hopeless. This book helped me do the only thing that I should and could do and that was to pray. Although I bought the book because of my son the book features chapters on all the many prodigals we may love: our parents, neices, nephews, or just those who touch our lives and we care deeply about. I am happy to say my prodigal is home! He is celebrating 9 months free of drugs and alcohol and has re-committed his life to the lord. This is a wonderful faith restoring book and a must read for anyone who has a struggling loved one."
1,bambi,"this was not at all what i thought that i was ordering when i recieved it. i was very unhappy with this purchase. also, there was no information on how to return the product. i will probbably not ever use amazon to shop again."
3,comfortable but hard to use,"I ordered this chair in order to take pressure off my lower back while watching tv, reading, or just plain relaxing. As others have pointed out it is not the kind anti-gravity chair that raises your feet above your head, but I wasn't expecting that anyway. It it basically comfortable BUT moving the chair into the incline position while sitting in the chair is next to impossible! (Others have tried it with the same results - so it isn't just me!) I have resorted to inclining the chair to the position I want, locking it in place and then (with some difficulty for a person with a bad back) climbing into the chair. I wouldn't have ordered it if I knew it was going to be so hard to use!"
2,Purchased three recliners but one had a defect in its main frame,I purchased three recliners but one had a defect in its main frame.It only was used for a week. The other two were OK. Should we not buy three items at a single order?
1,i must have gotten a reject,"the box was crushed when i got the chair. the arms looked worn. the mechanism was difficult to use, and only one of the locks worked. then when locked, it would sometimes let go with a loud scary buzz. i think it is dangerous. i hope the return is easy. we'll see."
3,What Happened?,"I have been a big Billy/Smashing Pumpkins fan for years. I always considered him a lyrical genius.When I received this book, I read through most of it and then put it on my shelf where it has remained.I am extremely disappointed in this book. What happened to his brilliance and the profound words? What happened to evoking emotion in the reader(listener)?I recommend you check this book out at the library before purchasing it. I love Billy but this book is not good."
1,"Corgan takes a dump, ... and than publishes it","This poetry could have been written by a deaf, muteThat is how I know Billy wrote it when he went tootPerhaps poetry is Corgan's personal catharsisBut Billy could not rhyme a word with catharsisHe does look like a pasty white pumpkin headIf only he would join Jerry Garcia of the Grateful DeadNow that Billy has ruined the genre of poetry for allIt is just as base as his music and his team, the CubsSo do not buy this book, if you have senseEven Grandma Corgan does not own this rubbish"
1,TERRIBLE,"I woulnd't give this bed board 1 star, but it didn't give me ""0"" as an option. This bed board is terrible. slips all over the place. comes out if you move in bed to much. Don't waste your money."
1,Not even close to being worth the money.,This should be $10 bucks tops. This is nothing more that a piece of cardboard folded up. I bought it for my queen size platform bed because I used it for my memory foam mattress. It didn't even spread out on the queen size bed. So I just used the cardboard box that the memory foam mattress came in. Works just the same when you make them flat. If you don't have boxes go to the store and buy some. It's a lot cheaper than wasting your money on this thing. If you want to make the bed firmer I would not get this. You would be better off going to Home Depot and getting a plywood plank.
3,Bedboard,"I have used this bedboard on a fold out loveseat bed. It worked well and made the bed much more comfortable, no more bars in your back."
1,Junk,Ineffective. Hub cracked after 1 use. A waste of time and money. Go to your favorite automotive tire company.
1,""" NOT THE ORIGINAL VERSIONS""","Stay away from this set if you want the original versions for these are all later re-recorded versions. I bought this mainly for one song called "" Don't Make My Baby Blue "" and was throughly disgusted when I heard it. I have the original on a 45 record and believe me the cd version is definitely different. None of the songs on this set are the original."
4,Good Collection for the $$,"While many of the Mercury & early Columbia recordings are indeed re-recordings, there are a several gems in this collection that are not only the original Columbia recordings, but they're hard - if not impossible - to find on CD. ""Hawk Eye,"" Granada,"" ""The Kid's Last Fight,"" ""Hummingbird,"" & ""I Believe"" to mention a few. All originals. ""High Noon"" & ""A Woman In Love"" are among the Columbia remakes. ""Love Is A Golden Ring,"" mentioned in another review is the original Columbia recording (with the Easy Riders), at least on the set I have. The rerecordings aren't bad, though, they're just not the originals. For the price and for the hard-to-find songs, it's a pretty decent set."
4,all too common today,"this book was written in 1975. i am sure many people( back then) did not know that teenagers can drink and becomeaddicted just as easily as adults. this paperback tells the story of one such teen girl. her name is sarah.sarah drinks in secret...she hides it from everyone(or thinks she has)...gets drunk and makes a fool ofherself...becomes drunk while babysitting...goes to an AA meeting...later on,can't get any alcohol so...has sex with some random boy in a van,just to relieve her pain of withdrawing from the booze(and to GET thatmagic booze down her throat)---uhhhh. damn girl.the dialog in this book is real good-very believable and the underlying story of the hurt that sarah feelsover her life and her parent's divorce makes this all too real to many of us. let sarah be a warning to alland remember not to be afraid to ask for help. help is always there."
1,iLive,"I am extremely disappointed in this product. The blue light is obnoxiously bright, the alarm comes on at a very high volume everytime, regardless of where you set it, the feedback from the iPod is unacceptable and the remote barely works.To make matters worse, I called customer service for the iLive and they won't refund my purchase price because it is ""operating as designed"". Apparently they are aware of the fact that the alarm turns on very loud and that there is feedback from the iPod. According to them that was how it was originally designed and manufactured, therefore ""operating as designed"". However, they assured me that the design team is taking this criticism ""into account when they design the next model""."
1,Responsible adults & pet owners PLEASE look elsewhere,"This book is full of cute cartoons in the margins and official sounding terms created by the author. At first glance you may believe you found the perfect partner to help in the training of your pet. After reading the book, I felt like an idiot to have paid for it. Who would believe an ""expert"" or the publisher would print ideas such as training your pet by spraying it with Binaca. Depressingly the book turned into an ""infomercial"" for a leash sold by the author. Be prepared for a non-stop sales pitch. Do your dog a lifelong favor look for a different resource. Consider the books by John Ross for a more sensible approach."
1,An infomercial in paperback form,I was an idiot for buying it. The author hawks her leash product throughout the book and acts as if not owning one will make you a bad dog owner. The Dummies book is much better for new owners. The Monks of New Skete also do a really good job. Stay as far from this infomercial as you can!
4,Not as Fun as Infantry,"Classic ""Alphie"" mine sweepers are a strange addition to the GI Joe lore, if you value decent soldiers, then this is as good as any. Using the model from WW2, they have a magneto mine sweeper which beeps and it is fun but if you like soldiers you will be depressed because he doesn't have any assault rifles, this toy is usually taken by the 'nerd' or kid who likes technology, still it's fun."
1,[not so hot],"It might be good for posing, but it's [not so hot] if you like to play with them. The joints are hard to move, and there are too many joints. G.I. Joe may be old but it's been around so long because they know how to make a action figure. G.I. Joe is a simple toy that's easy to move and play with. It might not be the best if you want to pose them in a display case, but If that's what your looking for, then just get a statue."
3,Smaller than most hardcover books,"I haven't used it yet... I hopped on Amazon as soon as I got it because it seemed very small and I wanted to see what the description said about size... and it says absolutely nothing. So, I just measured, it's 7.5""x10"". Just thought you all should know."
2,Warped immediately,"The other reviewer was luckier than I was. Mine warped immediately, which forced off the end pieces."
5,FOLK MUSIC AFFICIONADO FROM SEATTLE,I found this album trying to find someone who did Wichita written by Gillian Welch. I found Tim and Mollie O'brien and I am impressed with their harmonies and the beautiful way they deliver their songs about everyday people. I play it over and over because it just makes me feel good.
2,It worked but then...,It was working wonderfully until all the peices started to break. So I wouldn't recommend this. Fix those peices and it will be great
1,What about Men?,"Although I found the preliminary chapter interesting as I progressed I quickly found that this book has a feminist slant to it. I think that if the authors has focused more on a wide variety of individuals for their research, the book would have been more helpful to me. I think having a male perspective somewhere would have been beneficial."
1,It broke in just 1 hour after delivery,"I received this suction mount yesterday, first of all packet was not intact, the mount was coming out of the packet. When i put that on my front screen...after 1 hour it broke down in 2 pieces......the rubber it gets stuck to glass was there and rest of the parts broke down.Worst product i have bought from Amazon......no one should buy this product. I want amazon to refund my money."
1,Fell Apart Day 2,"I bought this because I lost my old one, and it worked as intended for all of 24 hours. The next day I came out to my vehicle and the soft disc had separated from the plastic completely."
1,Garmin Suction mount,"Although this was listed for all Garmins you can not use it on the NUVI series of GPS. It's simply too short. When you attach to the car window, you cannot set the GPS to a full veritical position since the top bangs into the wind sheld. Now the unit slopes at a downward angle of perhaps 20 to 30 degrees. The cup does hold well and releases easily from the window but in my case it's unusable."
1,Garmin knock off,Don't waste your money. This thing came apart in one week. a complete waste of money. I should have followed my instincts and purchased at a big box store.
4,Exactly what I was looking for.,"This suction cup mount was identical to the original one that came with my Garmin Nuvi 750 (which was what I was looking for). The suction cup on the old one was separating from the metal base that it was molded on. Hopefully, this one lasts longer than a year."
3,Garmin Suctin Cup,The neck on this product had a different configuaration than the original Garmin suction cup and did NOT fit the window as nicely.
1,Sucks: poorly sized.,"The ball joint is too small to hold the socket on the c-clamp. Sure, it holds alright in your kitchen, but try using it in a moving car! The slightest bump and the garmin falls off."
1,Broke Right Away,"I purchased one of these replacement suction cup mounts a little over a month ago. (The order was fulfilled by Karbey Inc.) I was sent an extra one by mistake, so I ended up with two. After a few weeks, the plastic part of the first mount separated from the suction cup. With some difficulty, I was able to get the suction cup back on, but it separates again every time I take it off the windshield. I gave up on it and started using the second mount. After two uses it did the same thing as the first one, but this time the rubber ring that fits onto the plastic piece ripped. Both mounts are now unusable. Definitely not recommended."
2,"Works, but could be MUCH better","It is what it is ... Cheap.It works, but doesn't fit nearly as tight as the original ... we'll see how it works out in the long run, but initial thoughts on it weren't great. I just need it to be a bit tighter to avoid falling off if you accidentally bump it.**Update** Okay, I've owned this thing for over a year now ... Good thing I found the original because this thing is a piece of junk! Constantly falls off the windshield ... I get it that it was cheap, so I can't expect much, but if I were you -- I'd try harder to simply find the original :)"
5,It sucks...,"...well actually. Nice product. Sticks, holds and rocks my window. You should buy this like asap, cheap price, good product!"
1,"Looked great, but broke and fell off window after 24 hrs (without the GPS attached)!","It looked like a good replacement - it wasn't. I attached it to the window. It had good suction. Less than 24 hours later, it was on my dashboard and broken. Apparently the suction was too much for the piece of junk. I am returning it as defective and buying a new one directly from Garmin ($14 + $8 shipping)."
4,gps holder,glad to have this now my Garmin GPS doesent fall off the window any more. the sun apparently dries out the unit.
1,BEWARE - Not Garmin and the ball is too small,"First they use the Garmin name which makes you think this is a Garmin product, but it's a cheap Chinese knock offBut the worst part is that the ball is too small so my Garmin Nuvi 3590 slips all around when the ball is inserted into the mounting bracketRip off!"
1,does not hold suction,"The device lost its suction after 1 week, not worth the discounted price. I will be buying one straight from Garmin now."
1,Dose not last long,"I've purchased four of these already and they all have ripped, the rubber just dose not last long. You will need to get more than one"
1,"Arm does not Adjust, not exact OEM replacement","I ordered this thinking it was a cheap replacement. cheap it was. however, DO NOT think that this is OEM exact replacement - it DOES NOT HAVE an adjustable arm. i use the gps primarily for rental cars, and always needed to adjust the arm height to compensate for the various windshields. *UPDATE* literally after the first use, the suction cup fell off. Completely worthless. I ended up tracking down and OEM and bought an original."
1,broken part and terrible return policy,I bought a suction mount that doesnt work and to return it I have to pay more than a new one. thsis is BS.
1,Does not with stand heat,"This product lasted about 4 months in my car. After a few months of early and late spring heat, the unit's suction cup separated from the arm while I was trying to mount it. The first sign of problems were the mount didn't hold suction consistently; I had to re-mount the suction cup mount daily. The product I received is defective or poorly constructed, probably both. Also, I vaguely remember the mount didn't come in a Garmin branded package, so that should have been a red flag to begin with."
1,Cheap,I bought 2 of the Garmin suction mount holders. Both of these holders broke within 2 days days of using them. This was a total waste of our money.
4,What a good show!,"This cartoon it's preety much a mix of ""Alvin and The Chipmunks"" and ""Josie and the Pussycats"" (which their movie it's excellent), but only that much better, great animation,great story development, altough sometimes it's boring and ridiculous, it's the best cartoon there is on Kids Wb's Fraturday along with ""Pokemon:The Johto Journeys"", the animation it's real eye candy,the songs are great,also here is a recommendation:If you leave in Mexico, avoid at all costs the spanish dubbed version,it makes the characters so boring and cookie cutter like, so then please bring a friend who knows how to translate english and then watch it with him."
5,Wonderful!!!,"This trike is the best trike that I have found for my son. It seems to be very well built, and is very sturdy. He is 3 right now, but the size of nearly a 4 year old. I was worried that this was going to be too small, but it's not even close. I love the rubber wheel, instead of the cheap plastic ones. And the handle bars are a better quality. This trike is worth the price. I would recommend this to anyone looking to buy a trike."
4,Very emotional story...,"I found this book very emotional, at times I could relate to her feelings. Very sad how this child was treated. It is also nice to know that there is always hope no matter how far things have gotten. Very well writen, and if you want to start to understand how people end up the way they do read this!"
4,Effective,The item purchased was effective. This is according to my nephew who took the syrup. No need for follow up.
5,Loved it,"I ordered the product hoping it would work wonderfully, I read alo of reviews first and felt confident with my purchase, the product worked great 100% I'd reccomend the product :)"
5,One Day the Weatherman,"When it comes to Novels, I am highly critical. However, I absolutely loved ""One Day the Weatherman"". I literally could not put this book down once I began to read it. The way the author brings the characters and the story together is wonderful. The plot of the story completely held my attention. It was such a great book that I was disappointed that it came to an end. I highly recommend this book!"
4,stories for some people,"The Book _Leaving Home_ is a book of short stories that some people can and do relate to. Personally I like stories that i can relate to with my personal life. The sum of the short stories that I have read have been mostly set when I wasn't even born yet. On the other hand the stories are fun to read about other people's experiences and becuase they seem to be true life stories it is interesting to see anothers person perspective on a different situation. In a poem writen in the book the poeple wanted to get out of the town they lived in, i saw that as breaking free from life and i thought that was a good choice to put in the book titled Leaving Home."
4,Dvorak version is even better!,"If you like Asdf asdf, you'll simply love Aoeu aoeu, released in 1932. While Asdf asdf enjoys worldwide popularity, Aoeu aoeu is clearly the more sensible older brother, with his marvelous efficiency and upbeat input configuration."
3,Not exactly the best....,"The pack I bought from Amazon LLC is not the package pictured above. Plus as I was organizing and checking the pencils I found I had 36 of them, but 2 of the pencils were not the numbers/ colors that were supposed to be in the pack. It's not a huge deal, since I'm not an actual art student, but very disappointing to spring for the good colored pencils and get this. Spend the extra 10.00 on the really good pencils (still Prismacolor, just not the verithin), i'm really disappointed in amazon and Prismacolor for the bad service."
1,Horrible Harry ant invation,I do not like this book it made no sence and was confusimg.It was about a kid that got ant duddy and lost it by letting ant's go. I would not recamend this book.
2,Took advantage of nothing but himself,"While I really enjoyed the idea of this novel, there was far too much that wasn't explored. The prefab time belt raised far too many questions that were never even close to being answered, and could have been handled in a much smoother way. I can kind of see how, with anything possible, a journey of self becomes the only real journey. But it's not a journey of self, more like a journey of hopeless selfishness. He doesn't really learn anything about himself. He never makes a change, he just ages and tries different things. The loop-of-fate ending makes this perhaps the saddest and most lonely book I've ever read (which is not a problem, just an observation).I wasn't a fan of the writing style, either. It's a little too short and clipped, too list-y, with next to no descriptions of surroundings."
1,Don't get fooled by Folded,"... I expected an entertaining saga about time travel, but was treated to Mr. Gerrold's ... coming of age. This book was poorly presented by my fellow reviewers and was misleading."
1,PHONEY ADVERTISING,I really don't understand why this book is given so many excellent reveiws. I completely agree with another reviewer who felt the book took a minor point on the dangers of time travel and spun it out to beyond tedium. The book sounds as though it was written by an angst ridden adolescent exploring his sexuality. Gag.
5,"This is a classic, now updated...","...by the author to accommodate events in recent history (e.g. the 9/11/2001). It was many years after I first enjoyed this novel that I discovered that the author was the perpetrator of the ""Tribbles"" episode of Star Trek."
5,Must read,If you love sci-fi or time travel this book is a must read. It kept me hooked. Everything about this book was wonderful.
2,Time travel as a venue for narcissistic eroticism,"A thoroughly disappointing (and disjointed) enterprise. Each explanation for time-travel paradoxes (or lack of them) was eradicated by a later episode of the main characters' (yes, that's plural) ramblings.And, concepts that offered genuine intrigue (meeting and interacting with a version of oneself who happens to be the opposite sex; bringing getaway estates wholly constructed to locations that predate the dawn of man) were left to flounder for lack of viable explanations as to how such events might have come to be."
4,"Good buy, works great",We cooked our first fondue meal the night we got it and it worked great. Very easy to operate and heats up quickly. We followed the manufacturers recommendation for heating the broth on the stovetop first to get it to a steady boil and then we were ready to go. This is a great idea when you don't have a half hour to get the meal started. Lots of fun and very easy to use.
2,Worked for only 1/2 hour then died,"After reading many reviews I settled on the Trudeau as I wanted an electric unit that includes an insert for cheese and chocolate. When received, the unit was exactly as described and we were excited to try our first fondue meal. Unfortunately, as per other reviewers, our unit worked for only a short time and is not dead. I am returning the unit for a replacement as I am hopeful that the replacement will be more reliable. If this product works it is the best fit for me - I will try one more time."
1,Does not get hot enough,This product is not worth ordering. It does not get hot enough for cheese. It will keep it warm but you have to first melt it in a pot on the stove which defeats the purpose of the product! Looks pretty but that’s about it.
4,"For its simplicity, it's very interesting and captivating!","I see that this book is not very popular, but that should not be the case! When i first flipped through the book, i thought ""oh goodness, another one of these"" - For it's about 2 kids (a girl and a boy) who grow up together and become very good friends and of course, fall in love, but the girl's father doesn't approve because they are of different economic class. But actually, this book is interesting! The wording is very different from what is in common books published, because it's a translation. But even the wording becomes attractive. The book is longer than it seems, even with huge font. Ole, the boy, is brought up poor, and eventually leaves to America to try and prosper. Meanwhile, Marie, the girl, stays in Norway and suffers from her Father's emotional abuse. In the end, this book is an adventure, and you completely sympathize with, and begin to love the characters!"
3,It does the job,"The overall quality of the product is not good but not that bad.It comes very well packed in a good looking box with all the advertised accessories.The plastic of the monitor itself feels kind of cheap but it also makes it very light, which is good if you want to mount it in the flash shoe.Contrary to the picture, the product I received doesn't have any brand printed on the front which makes it look more generic than it is (is not that Lilliput is a known or respectable brand but the fact that there's no logo anywhere on the device just increase the cheap feeling).The product does what it promises: Good video quality, in a very portable size and weight, for a fair price.You wouldn't want to showoff this product with your colleagues but it will do the job."
4,Wacon Graphire4 6 X 8 USB Tablet,"The tablet is easy to install and very accurate. It takes a lot of time to get use to the pencil. The touch is hard to master and I had to try several settings to get the one that worked the best. It is something that takes getting use to, and that only comes from using it. Frustrating at times but still better than a big mouse to do detail. My main use for the tablet is for Coral Draw program that I use for design and Engraving."
5,Best curl cream,"This product smells wonderful, first off. Also, it can be applied in the hair wet or dry for an instant curl boost. It really brings the life back to my wavy hair after a blow dry."
4,"Good fit/look, but a one minor problem.","Makes installation of an aftermarket head unit look OE. My unit had a short in one of the lights used for illumination of the HVAC controls. This is the only downside I had and I'm sure it's a one time problem, but still an inconvenience."
1,Poor product - Do not purchase,"One of the lids was threaded/unusable after only a few weeks. There are only two lids, which constrains transportability. The product is overall of poor quality. I wish that I hadn't wasted the few dollars on this."
3,Its an okay book!,"This book is easy to read. It is direct to the point but the 4 mistakes he mentioned are limited to only the basic option strategies. If you are a beginner to the options then you might want to check this out. But if you're already a professional options trader, try other books, because chances are you already know these 4 mistakes."
1,Skin Eternal Plus - Item shipped doesn't match item pictured,"I ordered the Source Naturals Skin Eternal Plus and the product, as pictured, contains DMAE, which is the reason I was ordering it. However, when it arrived, my label only shows the C Ester and Lipoic Acid. DMAE is nowhere in the ingredients list. I feel I was sent a different product than what I ordered. For that reason, I can only give it one star."
5,Nostalgic Lullaby's perfect for night-time or anytime,My 5 month-old son loves music and has fell in love with this CD and its wonderful collection of songs. I use it not only when I'm trying to wind him down for sleepy-time but to gently wake him up after an afternoon nap. We love to sing and sway to the beautiful songs. The songs have a very nostalgic feel and give you a warm fuzzy feeling. I think we'll be using this Cd for many years to come. It puts not only the baby in a good mood but also Mommy!
1,Grated on my ears like fingernails on chalkboard,"If you like the music on NPR's Prairie Home Companion, get this CD. Otherwise, take a pass - your nerves will thank you for it!"
2,scary songs,Based on other reviews I picked this cd for my 6 month old for something different than lullabys. Big mistake. The voices are so low and dark that he is scared of it. I use music in the car to calm him since I can't reach him in the back and this music just gets him more upset. Maybe he'll grow into it- for the price I paid I hope so- there are much less expensive collections he just loves.
3,It's ok,"I like my TP holder, it's cute and all, but I wouldnt buy this exact one again. They need to put some sort of cross bar at the bottom of the paper holding rod because after you slide 6 rolls onto this holder, the TP rolls tends to slide down and get mushed at the bottom. I have seen others that feature the design that im talking about, other than that, it's pretty and does its job!"
4,Works ok,Not the most comfortable glasses but it all depends on your head shape so for me it was not the best but it might work for you. In terms of quality the plastic flexes enough where it will not break and glass is average nothing special
4,Remington T-72,"Tight fitting, and they do the job. I shot thousands of rounds with these on over the last two years, all at indoor ranges, and they do the trick. Only downside for me is the rubber nose piece... it holds snug to the face, but the gun powder over time turns them a greenish color. Not a big deal, and could easily be overlooked, especially for the price, but I thought it was noteworthy.Would consider buying again."
5,Great for the money,These things are cheap and get the job done. So far I've not experienced any discomfort while wearing these and while wearing you barely notice they are there because they are so light. Bought another pair to use for guests that accompany me to the range
3,They do the job,I got these as a cheap pair of glasses for my girlfriend so I could teach her about firearms. They fit on your face and provide enough protection that a spent casing isn't going to take out your eye. I don't know if they will stop a ricochet or a serious full on hit from a projectile but as basic safety glasses they work just fine. If you are looking for a SERIOUS set of range safety glasses you should look no farther than a pair of WileyX glasses.
2,I don't recall why I ordered blue lens glasses.,"The lenses scratch easily, and they fog up. They trap moisture where the top of the glasses touch my face.I treated these poorly, because I didn't pay much for them. When going inside, I tossed the glasses in my day pack along with a spare shirt, etc. The cotton shirt was enough to scratch up the lenses so I threw out the glasses. If you want disposable glasses, or take better care of them, and don't plan to exercize while wearing them ...these might be for you. They aren't for me."
2,Airsoft and Fogging Up,"For Anyone who plays airsoft and is considering these glasses, do not consider them anymore. They fog up and when I was trying to wipe them down, I got shot. Yes they are Good for shooting and stuff, but if you are playing airsoft, these are not for you."
4,school,"this was a school book for spanish literature class, it wasn't the proper book this is the more complicated play version used for actors, but it was still quite good."
2,Not so great,I purchased this same exact otoscope set at Walgreens a couple months ago for around $10 and was not impressed. I am sure it is the same kit because it looked exactly like this and it came with the same little attachments and mirror. It was all plastic and had a flimsy feel. It felt more like a fisher price toy you would buy for your child to play doctor than a functional light to see inside the ear. You had to push down on the pocket clip to get it to turn on. You could see inside the ear but the view was somewhat distorted. The light was also somewhat dim. I ended up taking it back for a refund since I felt it was a waste of my money.
5,Medi-Scope is Great!!,"I have recently purchased the Ezy-Care Medi-Scope and can't imagine how I lived without it before!! It has made such a difference instead of having to just guess! Now I KNOW when to take my kids to the Doctor for an ear infection! I use mine ALL the time! It has great attachments, to check their eyes, ears, nose and throat! It comes with two size tongue depressors, one for the kids and one I use for myself!! I would HIGHLY recommend this product for any mother, no matter what your children's ages are, it's a huge help! Has paid for itself by all the doctor offices visits I have not had to make due to the fact that I can just take a peek in their ears or throat or nose, and can see for myself if they need to go to the Doctor!! Five stars for this product!! Thanks!"
3,Pretty good,"""The Other Brother"" (2001)The storyline was okay and there were even some funny moments in here. But Mekhi Phifer (Martin) isn't very convincing as a nerd and some of the cinematography leaves much to be desired. I even saw the boom mic in the shot when Martin and Paula went back to the park and saw their favorite artist. This film feels extremely straight-to-video. -EJR"
2,Very cheap and flimsey,"I knew as soon as I saw this thing it wasn't going to work very well... it's made from very thin plastic and looks like it probably cost less than 10 cents to make. Sure enough, it does a lousey job of cutting pills... they often break up, and you seldom get anything close to an exact half of a pill."
5,Why You Must Read This Book!,"Don't miss this diamond in the rough!This is a very overlooked book which touches on a little bit of everything, from soup-to-nuts, about writing copy and placing ads.I'm not sure why it isn't mentioned as much as the more well-known classics like the Ogilvy and Hopkins material is, because it should be.Although the book was written in 1962, it reads like it was written earlier -- perhaps that's why it's often not cited by the greats.Buy it today. You won't be sorry.Even if you're already a professional, the book will serve you well to stir up some good ideas -- maybe even for that promotion you're working on right now!"
2,I dont like the exercises and the instructor!,The instructor is so boring and not fun to watch. The exercises are complex and so hard to follow. I bought this for my stability ball that I bought but after I watched it once I don't think I'll use this DVD again. Go get Tone Trouble Zone by Amy Bento - that one is great.
3,Eh..so so,"This was my first fitness ball routine. And it kind of makes me not want to get another one. There are a lot of repeating moves in this video. I did like the arm and ab portions however. I have to say out of my 10 minute solution collection this one is my least favorite. The instructor was nice, kind of like being instructed by Laura Ingles on Little House on the Prairie."
2,It repeats and repeats and....,"I finally figured out what I don't like about some exercise tapes...when it's the same sequence repeated over with slight variations! I use this, but it's not my favorite."
5,Highly Recommend,"This is a great DVD and I would recommend this to anyone looking for a core ball fitness routine. I have two stability balls that came with their own dvd's and they both stink. I love all the 10 min solution dvd's and own four of them. This one is my favorite and I find that I do this about 3 times a week. The instructor is great and not at all annoying. Kimberly is encouraging and fun. And the 10 min for each segment flies by so before you know it, you have done a 30 min workout. My favorite segments are the upper body, abs (and I HATE ab work), and flexibility. And since you can create your customized routine, I sometimes do the same segment twice! If you are looking for a core ball dvd - this one is it!"
4,Good Workout,"This dvd really provides a good workout. I like it, because each session is really 10 minutes long and you can do the routines in whatever order you'd like."
4,Great!,Like the work out a lot. The cardio section is actually pretty difficult but my favorite section is the abs. She has a great move for your lower back/love handles.
3,IT was good.,"This was a good book, but it wasn't the best I have ever read. And she didn't do a very good job explaining things and a few other things. I wouldn't buy this book if you are new."
5,Saltwater Bible!,"I really cannot say anything that hasn't been said before. This is by far the best book for the beginner saltwater enthusiast. If you are just starting or are merely curious and would like to read about saltwater husbandry techniques, YOU MUST OWN THIS BOOK."
3,A young Callas,"This CD has historical value if you collect Callas. The quality of the recording is regrettably poor, even for that time. However it is nice to hear Callas in Casta Diva, her voice is pure and without hesitation."
2,"Fluffy, entertaining, light read","Nice, easy summer read. Fairly typical plot-line: girl gets dumped, has terrible boss, good friends...not-so-typically...gets to work with famous artist and travel around the world. AND (...) Happy ending. Good plane or beach reading, just don't expect anything too deep."
4,Good workout,"I really like that you can choose the exercise level that best suits you. The movements are clear and easy to follow, and you can change levels as your strength increases to challenge yourself more."
2,Not Pilates.,"This is not Pilates! If you want an aerobic dance class, this is for you. Ellen only does two actual Pilates exercises. She attempts to do the Pilates push ups, but it is mixed in with the downward dog yoga move. She doesn't explain the Pilates Powerhouse (deep trunk muscles) or how to use it. This is the first step in understanding Pilates. The only reason I didn't give this one star is because as an exercise video it's fine. Stop the misadvertising of Pilates. I am a certified Pilates instructor and would recommend other videos than this one for actual Pilates."

5,The Best......,"This product is difficult to locate. I have used it for about 4 years.Don't really understand their marketing, why they have removed it frommany retailers? The replacement products that I've seen don't come close to thisas near as I can determine.It's good for a light non-greasy moisturizer,a bit astringent, tightening quality.One doesn't need to use much. A small tube last me for at least 6 months.I have semi-oily skin, that is a bit sensitive, but not fragile. Go for it!"
2,A Big Disappointment,"Nivea sure missed the boat here.While the product soothes and moisturizes, it's greasy as hell and leavesyour face looking shiny and oily all day.Try Neutrogena Moisture for Sensitive Skin instead."
1,BAD PRODUCT,"This was supposed to be Liberace; however the DVD contains the BEVERLY HILLBILLIES, BURNS AND ALLEN, and OZZIE AND HARRIET.People obviously did their jobs when they inspected the DVD."
3,"Funky and different, but smallish","I bought this for my wife. Figured the clip could go on her purse strap and the phone would be accessible but secure. Problem is that it's too small. Fits a Motorola V710 with std battery very tight, pressing on side buttons and changing ringers. No way an extended battery phone goes in there. If you have a little flip with a thin battery, it would be fine. I'm pretty disappointed however as there is nothing on the web site to indicate how small and tight this is. I also tried a Motorola T720 and an LG VX6100 in there, both with the slimmer batteries, and they are very tight. Good idea, just plain too small."
3,"Informative, but......",I enjoyed to read through this book. The book is informative and I like his sence of humour. But I don't need about 50 pages of blank score chart. Also I need more pictures.
1,sent the wrong color coffee pot,"I purchased a white coffee pot and was sent a black one.These people do not carry a white one. I had to re-package the black pot, find a ups store and ship it back to them. They did send a letterstating a refund."
1,Burned eyes!!!,This helmet that I ordered was not the one that I received. The one that came in the mail was weeks late and it wasn't even the right brand (Dansi) It came in a windex box (what??) and there was no seal around the lense so I burned my eyes....Very disappointed and angry. I had to purchase another one just to replace it! Waste of money.
4,"Nice, but short","I ordered a medium even though I am usually a small, I just wanted to be safe. But this shirt isn't all that tight, it's just short. It just barely covers my belly and my back, and I make sure I'm wearing some sort of jacket or something when I'm wearing it.But, it is comfortable and it looks just like it does in the picture. The material is nice too, nicer than a normal shirt. If you're going to buy it, I suggest getting a large size if you want it to cover everything."
3,Almost what I was expecting,"It took me time till I found a holder that protects the tp's and is brushed stainless.Even thought I live in Europe I decided to pay more for the delivery that for then product itself.It arrived before the time scheduled and it seemed to be what I was expecting.I was very happy till I found a couple of defects (on the cover and on the side) while unpacking. I thought they were scratches but not, they are manufactured defects and are quite big.Whoever packaged it needs glasses... But ok, I try to think that nobody else will notice those deep lines."
3,dieux du stade 2009 dvd: making of the calendar,"as with the 2008 disc, NO FRONTAL NUDITY,even by the star players that did it in 2007. otherwise, some really nice, sexy men. some didn't even bother to get nude at all. lots and lots of behinds shown, but that's about it. the last nudity year was the 2007 dvd."
5,Sekkisei lotion,"I've used it years ago and really liked it. In the past few years I branched out and tried other brands but finally decided to return to Sekkisei. I use it as a toner, since the texture is a bit too thin for a lotion. The recipe of the lotion is based on ancient oriental medicine and it is packed with herbs that are great for healing, moisturizing and increasing blood circulation.I put some in my palm and gently pat the toner on to my skin. I don't like using cotton balls or fabric because I feel most of the toner get absorbed by the cotton, not my face. My skin drinks it in almost instantly, and feel soft and moist. It smells clean and slightly floral. On top of the toner I then put on regular moisturizer."
4,was the easiest thing I have ever had to install,"All I had to do was pop off the tabs that I didnt need, pop on the cd holding slot and pop it straight into the dash. no screws, no cutting, no aggrivation. The only thing I didn't like was it seemed like it might pop back out a little too easy."
1,Not as pictured,I was trying to replace a roller that I had...this one arrived broken and was not like the one pictured. This one is 2 pieces. The inside roller is a seperate piece that falls out. The turn knobs on the one I received were broken. I tried to contact company but they did not reply back.
4,Check your other copies of Midsomer Murders.,"Nearly purchased this set - fortunately read reviews and noticed titles I already have. I own series 1 through to 13. Titles in this set 12 appear on season 9 part 2 here in New Zealand. Went back and checked your set 17 and found titles there are on season 8. I am very weary of buying English series from Amazon as they do not correspondwith the series/season here. Got caught out with the Frost series have all the series from 1 through to 12, found15-16-17 appear on 10-11-12 here. Pity thought I had discovered more Midsomer Murders and Frost. Not Amazon's fault it is just the way things are packaged in other parts of the world. Will still buy my DVD's from Amazon great service."
3,bellagio,"the fragrance is light , it last about 15 minutes . i love the lotion and shower gel.use them together it will last about 30 mins"
2,Did not meet requirement - Not Practical at best,"This item was so disappointing. The sieve size was too fine that the regular white flour from the supermarket and cake flour (Food Lions) did not go through easily. I even used a table spoon in hopes to to help the flour to go through but still 20% did not go through and remained inside the sifter. It is not practical. So I gave up using it. I will not use it again.I have used the item once. If the seller could replace it with coarser shifter, I would really appreciate. Otherwise, I will never buy from this seller again."
2,NOT FOR KIDS......BUT GREAT FOR TEENS OR ADULTS,"the content is good........i can learn alot and so can my kids....but they refuse to watch since they watched ""que diermas bien"" which i also bought at amazon and is much more fun and upbeat.....i do not regret this purchase as it will surely help me but i wish it had more songs and was not so teacher like.....kids will ask for a dvd if they dont know they are learning:-)...try que diermas bien !! my kids beg for it.....i also bought ""international baby spanish"" from another site not available from amazon..and it was great too.....but will not play in the computor dvd player only on a regular...would recomment this dvd mom,dad and me ONLY for adults or teenagers!"
3,A pedestrian volume,"Having read a good number of biographies on Mary Baker Eddy, I found this particular volume to be well-intended but ineffective. About 95% of Nennemann's book has already been covered, repeatedly in some cases and in more detail, by other books; but the little new light he throws on the subject is interesting (particularly Eddy's discomfort with Christian Science promoting itself in proximity to Eastern religions and Spiritualism). The author seems to have genuine respect and affection for his subject, while presenting her in a non-idealized way --something to be appreciated; but the writing lacked style and content. Intending no great disrespect, whereas another reviewer mentioned the book kept him awake, I had exactly the reaction."
4,PS2 compact color game screen,this 5.4 mini screen is great for traveling and taking it with you. it is also quite light. exellent and a must have for traveling gamers. the mini BLACK PS2 does have holes in the bak but the silver one doesn't
1,Rip OFF,"This product doesn't screw into the ps2 slim. The ps2 slim doesn't have any screw holes in the back of it. I was really disappointed. You can't even call the company to compain or ask for advice. I guess I will email them, but i am sure that my complaint will be among hundreds."
4,Worth Looking Into,"The good thing about this collection is that it not only has some of the classic Siekienwicz material (back when he drew in his Neal Adams style), but it also has some material that would be largely unknown by many readers today--the early material, including the Werewolf By Night appearances and the Spectacular Spider-Man appearances. There is some really good material included in this collection, and it is appropriately named, if you're a Moon Knight fan."
3,response to request for feedback,"Sorry, this was a gift. Recipient requested this book from their wish list with Amazon. I do not know how to rate this item. I gave it 3 stars to fulfill the requirement to no. 2 above, not because I read the book."
5,Beware of the Blob!,"In this classic Goosebumps books, Zackie Beachamp wants to be a famous horror writer. He stumbles upon a shop that has been damaged by a fire. He finds a old fashioned typewriter. It's prefect for writing his horror stories. The shop owner gives it to him for free.Zackie rushes home and starts typing. He soon finds out that the typewriter is magical. Whatever he types becomes real. Soon there is a terrifying blob destroying the town. How will Zackie stop it?This is a fun book that kids and adults will like reading."
2,"Ordered one product, got another!!","I ordered what I thought was a mens deodorant, due to the picture that was shown for the product. What I got though was a womens deodorant that was different from the description and picture shown!!"
3,Trouble with the inlays,"I bought this for my 8 yo son a month ago. When the ring arrived, one of the inlays had come out into the baggie it was shipped in. Instead of returning the ring and making my son wait even longer, I just super-glued the inlay back in and hoped for the best. Now, a month later, another of the inlays has popped out. It's a really cute ring, but beware that you may be losing inlays. :( Luckily, we found the inlay and I will be super-gluing this one back in. I don't know if it is the same inlay that I glued before and my glue failed or if it is a different inlay. The seller was great; shipment was fast. It's just the product that is a bit iffy."
4,Grandioso regreso de la mejor Boy band latina,"Los barrio boyzz en su historial ya esta escrita como la mejor boys band latina al rmperse el grupo jamas pense volverlos a ver asi que me impresione al verlos otra ves de lo qu eme impresione mas fue de la armonia esta ves no hay que dudarlo que los barrio boyzz con sus tres nuevas adquisiciones estan mejores que nunca muestran unas baladas demasiadas de excelentes un tremendo cd que por pena no se dio buena promocion y no llegara al lugar que dbee estar como uno de lo mejores cd de los barrio boyz ls muchachos de puerto rico,creo que si hacen otro cd tan bueno como este y se da la promocion correcta deben entrar al mercado americano sin ningun problema entre los mejores on unas voces naturales no un grupo preplanificado como se hace es una armonia exacta solo deben mejorar a la hora de escoger canciones movidas pues padecen de esto no bailan y esa es su debilidad en un campo que eige eso pero enlo demas son lo mejor de lo mejor"
3,A rather thin book for the money,"Excellent as far as it goes, this 100-odd page book is actually a reprint of an exhibition catalogue rather than a literary or reference work in its own right. The text is informative but - apart from a couple of introductory essays - relates only to the specific pieces referred to in the catalogue and the exhibition it describes (at the Peabody). It is not intended to provide a guide to the criteria you should look for when buying antique Chinese furniture."
5,I love this book,"I read this book when I was a little girl and I loved it. I am so happy to find it again to share with my children. The artwork is beautiful, and it just draws you in to the book and brings it to life. The context of the book relates the moral well, and I love the moral of this Serendipity book. It seems like morals in storybooks are getting to be a thing of the past...it is nice to see these books convey to children in easy to understand ways, in this one, the moral is not to procrastinate. So wonderful to see this book again!"
4,great music,this album is loaded with many hooks and head nodding rhythms; the whole group does a well rated job of having a heavier sound than many rock bands and still manages to make the songs just as catchy. worth checking out if you like hard rock band.
4,Great book on etymology,"Dr Haubrich's book is great! I own the hardcover first edition, and have found it quite useful. There are other older books on medical etymology (usually gathering dust in the stacks of medical libraries) that are much more detailed and have more information, but Dr Haubrich's is the most readable. Sometimes I just pick up this book and browse (can't do that with the other books!). All in all, I would highly recommend this book to everyone interested in this subject."
1,You get what you pay for..buyer beware,"On my HP 400c dvd burner I have had a lot of problems using these discs. So far 13 coasters out of 40 discs. I have been using this burner for about 9 months now and have never had problems like this before. Using DVDidentifier I learned these are the same discs the dreaded CMC discs, and I have heard bad things about those too. My firmware is updated, I really dont think this is user error. Next time I will go for the bit more expensive bundle."
1,Doesn't work,I purchased this to use with my car air pump so that I could inflate an air mattress indoors without having to buy another pump. This product does not work at all. Do not buy it.
2,Disapointed,"This book is not really a restoration guide, it is more like a parts catalogue. There is very little info on how to restore a GTO. Instead it is just a book of endless part numbers with some exploded diagrams. Also the chapters are confusing, they should be divided by the year of the car. Instead the chapters include all years on the same topic. You can be on one page reading about a console for a 67 GTO and you turn the page and all of the sudden you are looking at a dash board for a 72 GTO! A very poor efort."
1,Not for me,"I was really disappointed by this book, given the other reviews. It does not deserve an average of 5/5 stars."
1,This book is a joke,I bought this book and after I got thru about 4 pages of it decided I needed a book that explains things more basic in Music Composition that this one. Yeah I'm probably one of the idiots this book was writted for but I never got a thing out of it. I couldn't get into any of it. I wouldn't recommend this book to any other idiots either. It's a waste of money in my opinion.
3,crochet Answer Book,It was in good condition at a good price ;it just did not have the info I was hoping for.
4,A must have crochet reference.,"I had a few problems with my crocheting technique which this book helped me address. Instead of just how to make a single crochet, it answers questions like why my circle won't lay flat or how to increase smoothly and how to keep the edges straight.I keep this little book with me whenever I crochet just in case I run into trouble. It is a nice reference. The only thing I dislike is finding the answer to my problem through the index is tedious. Wish there was a better way."
2,"Good for odor, but very DUSTY!!","I tried this cat litter based on reviews I read online. I have 2 cats, 2 litter boxes. My cats were new to my home and had used a clay type litter at the animal shelter. They accepted the Fresh Step easily. I tried the multi-cat version. The scented litter had a very strong perfume smell. Knowing that cat's noses are sensitive I started mixing it with the unscented Fresh Step. This was better. However, after using this litter for a few weeks I noticed a dramatic increase of dust in my house - particulary visible on our black piano. I had to dust it twice a day and who has time for that!? My son also complained the dust bothered him. I switched to another brand (Precious Cat) that doesn't clump as well, but the dust is way less. The other thing I didn't like about the Fresh Step is that it stuck to the bottom of the plastic litter box with the cat's liquid waste. I haven't found the ""perfect"" litter yet, but I'll keep looking."
5,Sci-Fi at it's best!,"The history, ghosts, murder, this book has it all. Hall finds a way to keep you guessing, on the edge of your seat from the first word until the gripping end. History buffs and sci-fi readers alike, will all love the twisting plot of The Holocaust Opera."
4,Exact replacement,this was a replacement of a broken carafe. it was an exact replacement which I was grateful for. I think it was a little pricey though.
2,"Great machine, bad accessory!",This is the 3rd espresso pot I've bought for my krups machine in 6 years. The handle keeps falling off.
4,the perfect guilty pleasure continues,"Visully stunning, graphicly violent, graphicly gory, graphicly sexy, this series can never be accused of holding back and will offend many, many people and I pitty the offended as this is a very entertaining and captivating series and a reward to those who are not faint of heart who give it a go.initially this season is a little awkward at the beginning following the real life passing of season ones sparticus Andy whitfeild. As sparticus Andy was charasmatic and bought great heart and humanity to a world of violance. Replacing Andy is Liam McIntyre, Liam had huge shoes to fill and he fills them admirably and makes sparticus his own without straying to far from Andys Sparticus, surely not an easy feet.In this series Sparicus leads the slave rebelion in a war against the Roman's, i don't really want to discuss to many of the plot lines, watch it for yourself, you will be entertained.RIP Andy"
4,Very good.,"I'd really like to rate this 5 stars. I do, but some change of actors/actresses was a little annoying. Of course this excludes Andy Whitfield's (RIP) omission. The change of Crixus's girlfriend (forgot her name) was the worst. But, a good show none the less."
3,Spartacus,"Eh. The first season was great. The second was ""different"" and this one was well, blah. I don't love it or hate it but I probably wouldn't buy it again."
5,Good show,"Good Show, comes in a clear hard plastic cover that is too small and has to be cut off, not the shrink wrap"
1,high hope bad result,"the first season and the prequel were extremely good... plot, acting, everything. My expetacions towards the second season were high but... there are too many gore and blood (it seems that they wanted to give us ""more and more"" but sometimes is not for the best), it feels that the new actor didn't suffer trough all the madness of the first season, it seems that he took vacations and is well rested. The new actress portraying naevia is a horror. The only episode I felt a bit of the emotion is when gannicus; doctore and crixus were in the arena fighting.I hope the producers invest more in the plot and in godd actors instead of computer animated scenes in the next seasons"
3,Whitfield Missing,"Without Whitfield, Spartacus is just not the same, even with the graphic novel-like violence. Additionally, the new packaging is poor: the discs slip into folders now, which increases the chances for more wear, in my opinion."
5,Doc's docabilly is great!,"For Doc's fans or want to be fans this is a departure into some early 50's country and rock. ALl the tunes are well done and have professional backup and several guest artists! Doc does all the vocals and I assume a lot of the acoustic work. I enjoyed this Cd and all who have heard it wanted a copy too. ONly thing missing are Doc's colorful commments and stories, but his playing and singing are great as always....."
4,Great Recipes!,Easy recipes and normal ingredients AND my kids actually like the recipes I've tried so far. The order and helpful hints throughout is a bonus. Our favorite is the Breakfast Cookies slightly modified to include chocolate chips.
4,healthy menu ideas,"I like the daily menu format; i also like thequick lunch/snack options, sometimes I dont want a full/big lunch so these ideas work very well for me.the menus are easy and contain most of the basic ingredients i already have in my cupboard.i dont really care for the index; i think the index should be done in order of the main dish and not the description of the dish.i have added to my cookbook collection and use it as a 'go to' resource quite often."
4,Great book to have in the kitchen,I have many cookbooks but this one is more than your average cookbook. It's set up for busy people who just want something healthy and fast to prepare and eat. There's a meal plan for each day; grocery lists; and helpful hints through out the book.
2,i had great hopes for this cookbook,"This cookbook may contain healthy recipes, but honestly I think they are a little dated. I have to say I was dissapointed, especially due to the fact that the counter stand doesn't work because of a design issue having to do with the front cover."
4,What a great idea!!,I think this cookbook is wonderful! It is really good for those that get lost when trying to create healthy but tasteful meals for their families.
4,Great Book,"The only reason this book isn't five stars is because it pales in comparison to Mick Foley's book, which was absolutely great. Goldberg does a great job with this though and it is evident. It is much better than The Rock's book. I'd say its probably tied with DDP's book. It can not even be put in the same category as Bret Hart's book. Bret's book absolutely sucked. If you are a wrestling fan or not, you will enjoy this book."
4,Good songs,"Buena seleccion de canciones de este artista, canciones del recuerdo y de las mas recientes relativamente hablando ya que el artista no ha tenido ningun big hit en los ultimos anos. Hubiera sido un cinco estrellas si el sonido hubiera sido re-masterizado."
1,what a rip off,"what a rip off.. on the front cover is a soccer ball, a football, a hockey puck, a tennis ball, a basketball and a baseball. i got this video based on that cover and the only items from the cover they show you how to make is the football and the hockey puck. furthermore, most of the items to make are extremely canada centric.. lots of hockey stuff and fishing stuff. save your money and find better videos on youtube."
4,whoa!!!!,"These give me that great, sinus-opening hit of wasabi that I eat them for, plus they're a great source of soy protein while being low carb. However, the amount of wasabi powder varies from case to case. A few don't have enough, then others almost take the top of my head off. There IS such a thing as too much of a good thing. Would have given them 5 stars but for the variability."
1,Hot stuff,The amount of wasabi in these things made me choke and tear up. The wasabi dust gets into the nostrils and is quite irritating. Perhaps these would be edible if you could clean them off a bit first. Made in China.
1,small,The Pendant is to small... I was fooled by the picture... and when I got it I could barely see it.
1,smaller then expected,"image does more justice to the pendant then expected. Received item and laughed! granted it is a 1/10th carat, I still expected it to be prettier. I may give it to one of my nieces when they start kindergarten in 3 years! Very disappointed!"
4,Christmas present,"Bought this as a Christmas present and she loved it. When I received it , I thoughtthe diamond in the Pendant would be a little larger but it looks great"
3,A Good reference book,I have some problems with the book as there are some errors in some of the photographs and there is no mention of the ESOP or Shuttle by United. But overall it is a good research guide about the carrier
1,Unsatisfied,"I received the product fast, but the protective packaging was very flimsy. When I opened the package the CD jewel case was cracked directly down the front. I purchased the CD as a gift."
4,A most wonderful read!,"Story is really is well developed; rich with wonderful characters,woven into a true historical event, aptly described. Makes you feel like you were there. In all, a pretty great read! Must read the followup story 'Petals from the Ashes' it is a continuation."
2,Pocket Kit,"I am somewhat disappointed with this product. First of all, it is made of cheap plastic and has a cheap look to it. Then while trying to install it, the side tabs (to adapt it to my car) kept falling out. After installing it, the bottom pocket is bowed in on the top and bottom. Also beware that the bottom pocket can be easily pushed down into your dash because it is held in from behind with four tiny plastic tabs. This product does not have the fit and finish you would want to put in your late model Ford car or truck. I will be buying a different one next time."
4,Nice pool that is deeper than most,This pool is about 4 to 6 inches deeper than a regular inflatable pool which keeps more water from splashing out. Good design.
5,WHAT A GREAT BOOK!!,THIS BOOK IS A GREAT GIFT FOR ANY FEMALE. IT IS HILARIOUS BUT SO TRUE. THIS BOOK IS A MUST FOR EVERY FEMALE WHO HAS A FRIEND. I COULDN'T PUT THE BOOK DOWN UNTIL I WAS FINISHED BECAUSE IT HIT HOME IN SEVERAL PLACES. THIS BOOK IS A MUST BUY FOR EVERY FEMALE OUT THERE. I HOPE THERE ARE MORE BOOKS THAT COME OUT ABOUT GIRLFRIENDS ETIQUETTE AND THE SUCH.GREAT JOB LAURIE!!
5,Rape of Mexico and the Native People,"I have read with great appreciation this book by career soldier and historian, General John Eisenhower. I had previously read and also have specific books on the Mexican War and the predecossor Texas Rebellion. The issue simply stated is ""Who will steal the lands of the Native Peoples, Weak corrupt Mexico or Strong, corrupt United States?""Currently, Mexico is reconquering the Southwest, which is a natural event in the history of ""civilization"". This book, which is a thorough military and political history should be part of the ""normal"" high school and college education of all young United States citizens, if only to remind them that the SouthWest and California were stolen, not from the Mexican who were colonizers, but from the Native Peoples."
3,Not as big as it looks,"It wouldn't fit the parts on it that I thought it would. Somewhat sturdy, but not heavy duty. Next time I will just buy something in person."
1,TERRIBLE!!,"I used this once. It blew off the pool with a mild wind. I ended up throwing it in the garbage. It is cheap and does not fit, even though it was the appropriate size for my pool."
3,Longtime Buyer From Amazon First Time Reviewer,So I had a hard time putting the cover on my pool today by myself. I wish it said somewhere that it is recommended that two people are needed for putting it on. My main issue is that it doesn't cover the pool tightly like the picture and there is a big pool of water in the middle from it sagging down. Any solutions on how to make it so it doesn't sag and get filled with water?
1,Wrong info!,"This cover actually measures 144"" (12 feet) by 76"" (6 feet), which makes it way too big for the pool I have. I paid as much for shipping as I did for the product, and the shipping costs are not refunded upon return. It would be an ""OK"" cover for a pool that size, but not for smaller ones. The plastic is thin, and the rope ties slide under the pool, not around it, which lets all kinds of bugs crawl under the cover and into the pool."
3,Very difficult to...,Its nice but (as in previous versions) very difficult to understand how to perform the menus.
4,politically nice,I love the way Seuss takes the daily problems puts them to poetry and sends them on their way. It is great
3,"classic book, but this copy...","I love this book and ordered it as a gift for my nephew. However was disappointed when it arrived because it was not ""like new"" as advertised. The spine and corners were bent and torn."
1,Not necessary....,"I was angry about ordering this. The GPS ordering page made it appear like it was a necessary item to order along with the GPS, so I did. Then the GPS arrived, and there was one in the box?This was deceptive.....and it really angered me.Amazon did make it right - they refunded everything, but only after I emailed them twice. It was shipped separately, so I had to pay separate shipping on it...etc...It was a pain - and all because of their deceptive sales approach on the page."
5,Must Have,You must have this item if your device will give you traffic information. Never get stuck in interstate traffic again as long as you have this connected to your device.
3,Product itself was great but...,"THe product itself was exactly what I needed, but I was disappointed in Garmin I had to buy one in the first place. The part that plugs into your car broke off inside the plug. Still haven't gotten it out yet. But this cable itself was perfect."
5,Garmin Adapter from Amazon,The adapter was perfect for my Garmin (which I thought was the culprit)...the problem was the little metal point on the adapter was gone. The new adapter was much cheaper on Amazon than ordering from Garmin and I rec'd it within a few days! Awesome!
5,Also supports the Garmin Nuvi 660,Best price I could find for a genuine Garmin 12v power adapter and works for the Nuvi 660.
4,Great replacement,"Pretty sure it is a generic replacement. I found no Garmin markings on it at all, but with that being said it works just like a factory one. Works great for my Nuvi 760. This one attaches to the mounting bracket and is NOT the mini USB one. Most that I could find were the mini USB and that is not what I needed. I ordered in and it arrived next day. Good product, no issues at all!"
1,Doesn't Fit!,"Well, this was one of those purchases wherein you're ordering one piece of merchandise and Amazon automatically puts together a package of other related, ""useful"" products that appear to fit into the overall subjective order; for a bargain price. In this case, however, someone at Amazon didn't do their home work.This 3-part purchase was two-thirds pleasing, but the power cord being reviewed (being the one-third of the purchase that was not pleasing) was conspicuously un-useful. Specifically, this power cord doesn't fit into any aperture of the Garmin GPS that the other two-thirds of the purchase was successful in achieving.It was a disappointing experience."
5,Quiet and moves a lot of air,I have purchased two of these air cleaners (one for the office and one for home). The design allows it to fit snuggly against a wall. Even the highest fan speed is relatively quiet. No assembly required and filters are lasting as long as the product claims suggest.
4,Air Purifier,"The unit is everything the ad said it was and more. I've read many reviews from customers who had low opinions of the ion-style purifiers. Consuer Reports published that the ozone produced from ion purifiers can actually cause breathing problems in certain people, especially with asthma, which I have.The positive reviews were of the Whirlpool Whispure, and it truely is ""whisper quiet"". So much so that when I turned it on the first time I thought it was on low, but it was actually on its highest setting ""Turbo"" I have it on Turbo most of the time and it's right next to me when I watch TV, and it never bothers me at all. The air flow is strong and circulates well.The unit wasn't delivered when promised, and I had to send an email to follow-up on the status, but the vendor quickly replied and explained the item was coming from the factory and had been slightly delayed, but it will be shipping soon and it did. I highly recommend this unit."
2,Unpleasing,"Raw is an unpleasing book. The recipes are obscure and hard to make. Crackers in a dehydrator, that takes 12 hours? Unless you have a lot of time on your hand, you wont be able to do some of the recipes."
3,Do you have a personal chef? Hand this book to him or her,"I found this book a very fascinating read, but, like many other ""chef-written"" books, I found the recipes to be far too labor-intensive. contain too many expensive ingredients for my purposes, and, in many cases, combine too many foods to allow for proper digestion.If you want to see what the stars eat when they drop by Juliano's restaurant, and understand what goes into those recipes which seem ""just like cooked"", this is a very good book. That is how I approached it. No way am I going to make most of those recipes (although I did find a couple of useful ideas).This is not a book for a raw food beginner looking for recipes to make this evening - it would scare away most people who do not live in the kitchen."
2,Beautiful but lacking!,"I got excited looking through this book at the beautiful possibilities of totally raw meals. It was my introduction to the raw food world. However, I have only made two things from it, and it has sat on the shelf unused. I bought two other books which I am pleased with and use all the time (ani's raw kitchen and jennifer cornbleet's raw food made easy). The idea of creating the foods Juliano presents in his book is nice, but executing the production of them is another thing. All the recipes call for a long list ingredients, some I've never heard of, and the glossary doesn't offer any help with vague definitions. Most recipes make you incorporate a couple other recipes into them, sometimes those recipes have another recipe in them. It gets overwhelming quickly. Maybe after a few more months of experience with raw prep I will return and give this another try. His odd collection of pictures of himself is humorous but doesn't add anything to the book."
4,Worth the Work,The recipes in this book are complex and long but totally worth it. I've found all of the ones I've tried to be delicious. Juliano is an extremely gifted chef. He's actually rather wasted on the raw food world. I'd love to see a cooked food book by him. His recipes aren't for everyday eating but I recommend it as his food is inspiring and beautiful.
4,Yummy,"Sometimes it seems a little time-consuming and the list of ingredients can be intimidating, but everything I have tried from this book has been extremely tasty. Once you get a taste for this raw, living food, everything else seems drab by comparison. It is very innovative, creative and delicious."
5,Great,"The book gives a really great look into colonialism and missionaries in Cameroon in the first half of the 20th century. Looking into Beti's past, it's obvious he has a strong bias against Christian missionaries--specifically Catholics. Nevertheless, the book is really great and has much deeper meaning even on a religious level, as there are strong parallels to the Bible."
3,Cute but LOUD,"I got this for my daughter to use in her closet ""fort"" but the thing is SO loud. If you don't mind the noise it's really cute and fun. Each time you press the button it rings three times and it is horribly loud! Great for kids though."
3,Little Niece loves it,"I bought this for my nieces 6th bday - she simply loves it. Its not the sturdiest thing around, but living in a house of all boys she loves that they now have to ringer her doorbell in order to come in, Really cute product"
5,A Seth Warner historical review,"This is an excellent historical document which has been very accurately researched by Daniel Chipman, a person who actually knew Seth Warner.A ""Band of Cousins"", Seth Warner, Remember Baker and Ethan Allen were three very important individuals in the establishment of Vermont as a state.Anyone interested in the early history of Vermont and the beginnings of the Revolutionary War should read this book."
1,Horrible Company,WeatherTech is the same as MacNeil Automotive. They are a horrible company that has zero customer support and do not know what they are doing.
2,Dissapointed!,I was very excited to see a high chair with a toy bar to keep baby occupied while I am cooking. However! She has to look up to see it! Poorly designed! The tray is large and awkward. The high chair is VERY hard to push around even though it has casters. I like my other high chair that retailed for less then this one did! I am not impressed at all with this high chair. I now know why it was 1/2 off!
1,"Terrible chair, way over priced!","We received this high chair for a shower gift and by the time we were ready to use it it was too late to return it, or else we would have. Tha chair itself was difficult to put together and is very bulky. The one handed tray release never works for us and that is the most frustrating part of all. It is not easy nor convenient. There are less expensive chairs on the market which are easier to use and less bulky. I would not recomend this chair to anybody I know!"
2,"Very fragil, not reliable",This latern is all plastic. The handle fell off the second day my daughter used it and broke some of the parts. It will not be reliable at all for a camping trip.
2,Not a Fan.,"This is a heavy mini volume, sized for the knitting bag, but not the best choice for it. The Question/Answer format is annoying. The answers are more than incomplete. Pithy gave way to informative. My knitting bag reference remains The Knitter's Companion: for it's answers and diagrams, and all in a lighter package."
4,The Knitting Answer Book: Solutions to Every Problem You'll Ever Face; Answers to Every Question You'll Ever Ask,What a great help this book has been. I am just finding my way back to knitting after being away from it for so many years. This book has been a great find.
5,Great Reference Book,I take it with me whenever I'm knitting. Money well spent. Answers every question you could think of asking.
5,Knitting Questions and Answers,"I love this book. It's just the right size to keep in my knitting bag. I even used it while knitting on a plane trip to and from Portland, OR. I've read reviews that state it is hard to find the questions and answers you need. I have to disagree. The index is divided into chapters with several topics under each chapter heading. It gives great instructions and illustrations from best cast-ons for different garments to solving problems when they occur. It answers questions about reading patterns, shaping, fitting, and finishing, just to mention a few. There were even several suggestions for estimating the length of the tail when casting on. The print is easy to read and I have had no trouble finding answers to all the questions I have had thus far. I highly recommend this book. It's a great sized book for the price."
5,Glad it's not vinyl!,"If this were a vinyl record, it would be partly worn out by now. I've listened to this over and over, and am not done yet. Kenny Smith's guitar playing is as tasteful and refined as any in the bluegrass genre. It inspired me to buy his instructional video and tablature too. The vocals on this album are great as well. I'll be buying his new CD soon!"
3,not impressed,this serries of books are all the same weight training book as all the other 30 that he put out its all the same workouts and if you already have one for a diffrent sport then its pointless its more for body builders not gymnasts unless its a couple of cents its not worth it
2,Misleading title - this is NOT for gymnasts,"The author comes across as a normally competent weightlifter, and the advice is very standard and of reasonable quality. If the author has any understanding of gymnastics-specific strength requirements, he isn't successful in expressing this understanding via his book."
4,Amazon cheating?,This board sells for $30 regularly elsewhere. So why deceive your customers by claiming it's on sale?
2,Warps and cracks over time,"I bought this cutting board and have used it as my main cutting board for around a year. This board will warp and crack over time, even after regularly applying mineral oil."
2,The wood came off !,without being used the coating for the wood came off and the wood began to splinter while cleaning. Again the board has never been used! I returned it right away!
1,WELCOME TO PARADISE,DVD is in PAL format which will not play readily in the USA. Product did not list that it would be shipped from UK or I would not have ordered. Contacted seller who offered to refund if I sent back to UK from USA. More trouble than it is worth (will play on my laptop). This was the first and last time I will buy from Amazon instead of Ebay where description and shipping is displayed better.
4,This is better than most of the other Glycemic Index books I have read.,"This book covers more information than other books that I have reviewed on this topic. There is a lot of advertising for the Glycemic Level way of eating, but the topic seems to still be lacking in information. The Complete Idiot's Guide offers more comprehensive information including a longer list of foods with with the Glycemic Index levels. This is the first book I have read that shows the formula for figuring the index yourself."
2,Difficult ro read,The format of this book was not the best. It could have been laid out better. I still have not gotten through it. It does have some good information in it though.
5,Rare and Beautiful,"I have been searching for the album Look at Me I'm In Love by the Moments on CD literally for years. Great grooves to put you in the mood. It is a medley of heartfelt and beautifully sung soul ballads (glorious melodies, harmonies and lyrics, ""Look at Me I'm in Love"" and ""Come Away"" are 2 that really stand out) along with some very danceable, original top 40 disco tracks (the track ""Girls"" being a global hit). This really is quite an eclectic, unique album as several tracks are also sung in French and guys, if you have a special someone you would like to impress by showing off your soulful, romantic side ...... do yourself a favour and play it for them ........"" you won't regret it, a day of your life"""
3,Not this one,"My son LOVES Kipper. He likes to watch the videos at night when he's winding down but not this one. It scares him. He doesn't like the Robot, the park monster or the dinosaur. He isn't usually scared of things. He watches Scooby Doo. Whenever I put this one in, he says ""Not this one, it's mean."" (???)"
4,NICE GAME,This game is cool. Alittle bit difficult cus you have to be all covert and stuff. I wish they added in multiplayer in there. But maybe in #2. Well all in all this game is nice. You play this ex navy seal ex CIA i think. and He runs around shooting and knocking people out. I like how you have to hide in the shadows and stuff. Dont set off to meany alarms or your mission is pulled. Start back from where you last save. It can be a pain some times but a nice game all in all.
3,Fun Game...but not a shooter!,"If you are thinking about buying this game, please rent it first. This game is fun but definitely not for everyone. Like the other reviewers have said you often need to re-load every mission a bunch of times and through trial and error figure out the way through each mission. Waiting and not killing can be difficult for some gamers... especially the not killing part. HOWEVER! If you have the patience this game has great controls and awesome graphics! Splinter Cell can be a very fun game but you have to keep in mind it is not a shooter!"
5,Splinter Cell - The best game for the Xbox this year.,"Hands down. It's no contest. Seriously, there isn't another game like it on the Xbox, on the PS2, on the PC (until Splinter releases on that a couple months afterward).What sets this game apart is its revolutionary use of shadows. You hide in them and try to avoid enemies (but you can take them out if you absolutely need to). The main character, Sam Fisher, can do all these neat moves, like rappel down walls and use night and heat vision goggles. Just check out the screenshots and the moves, and you'll see. There is no contest. THIS IS THE GAME TO HAVE!"
5,(almost)THE BEST! (best: Halo),"Tom Clacy's Splinter Cell has best graphics that I have ever seen in any game. Splinter Cell is also the hardest game I have ever played. Splinter Cell has only one challenger, and that would be Metal Gear Solid 2: Substance. I have both games and like them equally, and play them equally. What I like about MGS2:S is that it has extra levels and extra features like over 350+ VR Missions and Alternative Missions. Splinter Cell on the other hand does not. So what game is the better gmae? Well my vote goes to Splinter Cell because of it's outstanding graphics and amazing story. The realism of the game really got me hooked on it.Overall: MGS2:S is a good game, don't get me wrong, but I like Splinter Cell and i give it 5 stars. don't bother renting it, just buy it. It will save you 7 bucks. (I bet you can't beat it before for the sequal is released in 2004! The sequal is called 'Splinter Cell 2 Pandora Tomorrow')"
1,...!,"Im 30 mts into the game, and the game will only allow me to play the way it wants me to play. I approach this guy 10 times as I try to take him out without a gun. Everytime he turns around no matter what he is doing. What kind of ... game is this?"
3,An ok game,"This game is not that great i have had it for 4 months and i only beat the first level it is not really fun. way to hard, no fun!! Get other games like halo, trust dont waste ur money as i did!!"
4,Fun game but...,This game is great but it has flaws. The graphics are great and so are things like shadows. I really wouldn't classify it as a shooter though. It's more of a strategy game. You really don't kill lots of people. Like in the CIA HQ level you can't kill anybody. Some other flaws are strange checkpoints and computer mess ups. If your a person who likes to run in and blow up everything this is not for you. If you would like to test your paitence this is for you. Thhe trail and error process is frusterating. This game is great depending on the gamer you are.
2,Not into it....,"I was hearing sooooo much about this game and all my friends were saying how great it was so foolishly I just went out and bought it...bad idea. Don't get me wrong i do realize why many people like this game, but it just wasn't my cup of tea. I like games like halo where you can go rampaging , but in this game you barey get to shott its all about stealth and sometimes you have to cross a like ten foot room but it takes you like 20 minutes because you can't have sensores see you, im just not that patient. Although I absolutely hate the gameplay, the graphics are amazing."
5,GREAT!,"This has got to be one of the best stleath games ever. You play as a CIA oparative and have to go all across the world to do misssions. You have a great assortment of gadgets for all kinds of things. You have non-lethal methods of taking people out and knocking them out. I give this game 5 stars, this is a great game"
1,This game is the worse game i've ever played,"This is probly the worse game i've ever seen. Even extending to games on other consoles, this is the worse. I looked highly upon this game until I actualy played it. This game is just no fun to play. Metal Gear Solid is such a better game (I got both games at the same time and I played MGS much more then Splinter cell). If you still insist on buying this game atleast get it at a place where you can return it. Just to make sure...Oh yeah, one last thing. The only thing that I really liked in the game was the lighting effects. Those were great."
5,Why So Cheap???,"This CD has become one of my favorites since getting it about 6 weeks ago. I highly recommmend it for anyone who likes to listen to beautiful easy listening melodies. As I write this, I see that it can be purchased for under $2.00 used. What an incredible bargain!I think this group just needs a bit more recognition and promotion. It is head an shoulders above anything that darn Spears girl ever dreamed of..."
1,totally insulting,"lembcke admits that most ""fictional"" occurances of vietnam vets being spat on were at the san francisco airport, which is where my father-in-law got it as soon as he walked off the plane. i heard lembcke on the air america this morning and i was completely offended by his smug attitude and disregard of the servicemen that were actually, physically spat on. just because it wasn't in the paper doesn't mean it didn't happen. i agree that the nixon-agnew administration made people in the anti-war movement into monsters, but it's ridiculous to say that stories of spitting were all invented. anybody who's felt their blood boil becuase of politics, a war or any social issue or injustice knows that, unfortunately, their emotions can get the better of them. i'm not proud of it but let's not deny it."
1,Leftist Whitewash by a mental deficient,"Gee - a VVAW member gets himself a University position, then does ""research"" that whitewashes the past of - anti-war protesters of the Vietnam era.It is really a shame how far the left has fallen. The fact that Lembke can write this trash is sad, but that other modern lefties would buy into it is really silly and disgusting.A good read for someone who really wants to educate himself on how far the left has fallen into psychosis, and how far they are willing to go to rewrite history. Possibly also useful for anyone looking for a reason to avoid Holy Cross.----- RevisedThere are reviews - HERE ON AMAZON - calling Lembke a liar.What a farce. A real ""mythbuster""!"
1,An incident,"I of an age where I have no political ax to grind either from the far right or far left. Frankly I'm really rather tired of all of the polarizing screeching from both sides. I can however relate an incident that happened to me in Chicago in 1970. I was a Marine PFC in uniform walking down Michigan Avenue to catch a train home for a few days of leave before begin sent to Viet Nam when a significantly older waitress came running out of a shop yelling at me that I was a murderer. She followed me for a bit, continuing her tirade and then quickly ran back to her place of work. There were no newspaper reporters or photographers on hand to verify the incident for Mr. Lembcke, but my memory is very clear and it happened just as I report whether or not Mr. Lembcke or anyone else believes it or not. There was a businessman walking along beside me who simply remarked after the lady left us that, ""It takes all kinds to make a world."""
2,Dean Martin Variety Show,This definately was not worth what I paid for it. The quality was not that good either.I thought that I would be getting a set of videos it was only one disc. Not worth $ [...] bucks.I should have bought the one on TV.
2,Wastin away,"Somewhat entertaining, but practically a bit of a waste of time and money. Poor information for the most part. Some incorrect information I found, which I emailed to the author about. He asked me where I located the bad information, but then he never got back to me to help me or apologize."
5,Veggie Tales Christmas Album,This is a cute album that my children can listen to and is not offensive. Anything Veggie Tales is a big hit our house! Now we can take it on the road too!
3,Not quite what I expected.,"I was a little disappointed by this product. The picture makes the sculpture look like white marble, but the product I received is light yellow. Also the spear pole is plastic, like the plastic stick that remains after eating a sucker. The gold paint on the sculpture as well was sloppy. All in all, I thought the product was a low quality creation."
3,using it now,"it's rainy season. i put this over my gazebo made of those materials that rips when windy. so far, it's been good"
5,Saint Etienne - How We Used To Live,"Saint Etienne's ever-morphing HOW WE USED TO LIVE gets tickled by Dot Allison and Aim, with the former going for cool and throbbing, while the former opts for carefully constructed beats of jazzy hip-hop. Righteous. As for b-sides, ""Roseneck,"" plucked on zither strings, maintains an arch elegance softened by the warm electronics, and ""Red Setter"" thrums with warmth from the start. Make this single how you live now."
5,Excellent business book,"Very interesting read. The author clearly loves Google but that aside, he covers the story from the start of Google as a research project at Stanford University through to their IPO and after. The best parts of the book for me was the incubation phase where they thought it was a good idea but needed to figure how to make money off it and turn it into a successful business. Lots of details on the key decisions made along the way but not too many details where you'd get bored reading it.I appreciated how the author covered this as a business story covering the early investors who believed in the value of the idea to the immensely successful branding of the Google name. If business and technology companies in interest you, I don't think you'll be disappointed reading this book."
4,Did you know a brain surgeon worked on their systems?,This book was pretty awesome and I couldn't put it down. Those guys are geniuses and it sounds like everyone they hire is a genius as well. They had a brain surgeon design their network. Now who would have thought to do that? How do you keep your employees from going offsite to have long lunches? You bring in a gourmet chef and provide free meals! Google was developed at a time when there were already big name search engines. It just goes to show that you can build a better mousetrap.
1,Disappointing,"If you've been reading the newspaper, there's not much new here. Vise skims over issues but doesn't help you understand them.He describes Google's library project, but doesn't explain how these millions of books are to be scanned. He says ""click fraud"" is jeopardizing Google's advertising model, but he doesn't explain how these bots are created or how they can be stopped. Several times he tells us Sergei Brin is a great deal-maker, but he cites no good examples -- except that Brin once redirected the private jet to London to pull an AOL Europe deal out of the fire ... by dramatically sweetening his offer to outbid Yahoo.There are many other examples where you'd expect greater insight or behind-the-scenes reporting. The auther doesn't seem to have gotten any inside access to the founders, the CEO, the VCs or any other key protagonist.You do get, however, a recipe for fried chicken."
1,This book should never have been printed,"There is absolutely no substance, organization, or just plain good writing in this book. I was forced to read it for a book club and it is honestly the worst book I have ever read. I'm certain the editor didn't even open the book, betting that anything with Google on it would sell. And they were right.If you are looking for information on Google, look somewhere else."
2,Was this written by the Google PR department?,"Here's a quick summary of the book--Everything that google does is wonderful and google has changed the world as we know it. Come on. How about a little more impartiality. How about going more into privacy and IP issues? I gave it 2 stars instead of 1, but I would not recommend buying it."
1,Trades one set of myths for another,"The author warns in the introduction that he is not to be trusted, and it is a good idea to heed his advice. Indeed, the book does identify some facts that need to be debunked, as do similarly themed books such as Myth Information by J. Allen Varasdi and Lies My Teacher Told Me by James W. Loewen. And Shenkman is an amusing writer with a reader-friendly style. But Shenkman doesn't deal primarily with specific factoids that are simply incorrect. He sprinkles historical facts into a highly subjective view of history. True, some subjective views may not fit the facts well, but Shenkman often settles for exploding an old hasty generalization by substituting a generalization of his own. Too often, he cites ""no evidence"" as permission to draw conclusions that themselves have no support. If you know something about history, this book is apt to frustrate you. If you don't know much history, this book is no place to start."
4,scosche power connector,"as described, only one problem - not all wires matched up with radio, but was easily cleared up with phone call to scosche tech support who knew exactly the right answer without even researching it, would buy again"
2,Nothing special,The price indicated to me that this kit would be extremely high quality. Product is nothing special. Get what you pay for doesn't apply here. The clip that is supposed to stop the flow doesn't close tight enough to do the job. This bottle seems way overpriced in my opinion. If the seller sends me a new flow stop clip I will update my review.
4,a fabulous read!,"Kim Chernin's latest effort, THE GIRL WHO WENT AND SAW AND CAME BACK is an incredible book, quite different from any other novel I've read. Mignon is a troubled and mysterious figure, who appears and disappears from Charlie, the protagonist's life, over the course of a lifetime. It's a quite provocative premise and Chernin does an excellent job of creating an element of suspense and addressing difficult issues. I heartily recommend this book to anyone who wants to read intelligent fiction."
1,Just... weird.,"CD's should CLEARLY say if songs are remixed, live, or just plain different versions. The ""Remix"" Disc 3 has some okay stuff... the rest of it sounds just plain weird."
2,Aquastar 125B,"I don't like the fact that it sporadically stops heating partway into my shower. My gas line was increased (and from a high pressure supply, regulated down)- it did not help. The water pressure is 45 psi. I cleaned the inlet screen - it was essentially clean anyway. We don't run anything else when showering.Other than taking up less space in the furnace closet, this thing has no advantages for me."
5,It's about time!!!,The Producers are one of the best kept secrets of the 80's. I had the pleasure to open for them and it's great to see somebody put some of thier songs on CD! This CD is a bargain!! I only wish they would release Run For Your Life on CD!
2,Train set not for kids,"Although this set makes a very attractive train set, it is not durable. This is for the adult train enthusiast. If you're looking for train sets for kids try Geo Trax; they last forever and have tons of fun accessories. My boys had both the Lionell sets and the Geo Trax. They preferred Geo because the Lionell broke too easily."
5,Sweet Evil,I thought that the movie was really neat and the acting was excellent.I also think that Scott Cohen is really hot.
3,Is it worth the cost ?,"The installation cost of this unit is staggering, at least to me. With the requirement of a larger than standard gas line and other installation requirements, the cost of of putting this unit in your home is over $4,000. including the cost of the unit. I cannot justify the expediture."
5,Amazing Illustrations,We bought this book so my son could complete a school project. We were blown away with the beautiful illustrationas and therefore bought another copy for a classmate who idolizes Leonardo!
4,A Thoughtful Reflection on Childhood and Food,"Holy Hunger struck a deep chord in me, not because I share Bullitt-Jonas' family history or her obsession with food but because in it Bullitt-Jonas insightfully reflects on her primordial family relationships. The book is about the early life of a woman with an eating disorder, but it is also about the pain of growing up and discovering the inadequacies and absences of parents, even loving and smart ones. Bullitt-Jonas' story is one of sadness and loss. At the same time, her quest leads her to redemption, joy, and victory.I found the book utterly captivating and I highly recommend it."
4,Good for 50 plus age,This is a good book and reminds me of how important exercise is for a woman. My husband is reading the book for men and has started walking seriously.Joan
1,Waste of time and money,"What a waste of time and money. I wish i could get my money back. It infuriates me to know that i gave any money to these wack jobs. I read the sample and it sounded like an interesting read. beyond the sample is where you see what they are basing their conclusions on that Eating right and exercising 6 days a week and you""ll live longer. DAH!!!! The evolution theory to support your premise, well guys that is just a theory and a stupid one at that."
5,Best book of halting the aging process!!,"I purchased and read Younger Next Year - written primarily for men, but when I found out there was a women's version I jumped at the chance of owning a copy! This is the gospel on how women can live to their best capacity in the last third of life. It has everything you need to inspire you to get up and get going to enjoy those later years in your healthiest mental, physical, and emotional condition. I have sent copies to all the women important to me. This is something I have kept by my reading area and pick up daily for a dose of encouragement. Younger women should be picking this up by their thirties to get them excited about the best years ahead!!"
4,Good motivator,"This book was a good motivator for me -- with some good images that have helped me keep fighting to get exercise into my routine. It's a good blend of science and practical living, although I'm not sure why the practical portions are written from a man's point of view since the book is for women. Seems like it would have been much stronger had a woman written those sections.But all-in-all -- good book!"
5,the best little motivational book on the planet!,"I have purchased at least 10 copies for my friends. It is scientific and matter of fact, honest, hilarious, and inspirational about eating and exercising for a very long life. I am stronger, I have more energy, I am happier and not spending as much money...And my cholesterol has taken a nose dive. Every tool a woman needs is in this book. Buy it today!!!"
3,Breezy entertainment...,"What it's NOT:Not a diet bookNot an excercise programNot a spiritual enlightenment bookNot hard science but a little science..This is a lightweight, chatty, sometimes-inspirational and CRITICAL call to action for middle age women to get stronger, and live longer. Like a fun, earnest, no-nonsense lecture from a beloved and knowledgable uncle who's trying to set you straight. No short cuts. It's all hard work and worth it."
