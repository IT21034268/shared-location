1,Not Artsy!,"I am a big supporter of independent film making, especially when it involves T&A, but June Afternoon in simply not worth the money. The production quality is very low, however the must disappointing element is the lack of creativity (no story, no dialogue, not artsy!). Whoever was shooting this was obviously lacking vision, erotic or otherwise. The model is cute but she is boring and fails to bring that certain amateurish charm I was hoping for. The only redeeming part of this DVD is the extremely short run time (30 minutes). I tried contacting the production studio to find out more about their business, but they are nowhere to be found."
5,Very upbeat music,"My 5 year old daughter loves this CD. She has 4 of Parachute Express's CD's, but this one is probably her favorite. Happy To Be Here, High-5-Ious, Smooth Movin' Boggie Express, and Polka Dots, Checks and Stripes are her favorite songs because of the infectious beats and very singable words. But she really likes all of the songs on this CD. This is also a CD that I like listening to. We will sing the songs together, and clap together on Smooth Movin' Boggie and give each other High 5's during High-5-Ious. This CD was well worth the money."
4,An illustrated history of the Spanish Civil War.,"An excellent summary of the Spanish Civil War. This is an illustrated book of the war, and Preston is a well regarded historian of this event.This book is less than two hundred pages, but the summary and photos convey the brutality of this war. I think Preston gives equal coverage to both the rebels and loyalists. Also, a good portrait of the major characters in this war, and the politics involved which resulted in the Civil War.For a quick summary of the war, this is good book to start with."
4,she dreams of deer,"A strong thread of spirit runs through this book in the form of religions, visions, seances and psychic flashes, but in truth, the reader is completely free to dismiss it as ""pure hokum."" The book takes some time to get going. It seems like it would be difficult to love these troubled, hurting characters; a haunted bartender with no taste for joy and a hunger for married men, a brilliant and suicidal man with muliple restraining orders, a perky pastor who absolutely hates her church. But when the author loves her characters as much as Huneven does, we have no choice. We have to love them. This is a thoughtful, sweetnatured read, full of small details and tolerant affection. I never laughed out loud, but I smiled plenty. It's that kind of book."
5,Darkly Prophetic,"John Gunther was a globe-trotting journalist of the mid-1900's who wrote a number of excellent books focusing on politics and life in various parts of the world. He is best known for ""Death Be Not Proud"", the story of his son, who tragically died of a brain tumor at age 17. Gunther traveled extensively through Europe circa 1936, interviewing political leaders and assessing the climate all throughout. His analysis of Hitler, the possibilities for war, and the social turmoil working its way through almost all of Europe make for fascinating reading, knowing what is soon to come. Gunther provides us with a unique perspective on WWII, reporting up-close on tensions and issues that have been much forgotten over time."
1,ASLVidReveiw,This was not the item I expected to receive. I am highly disappointed. I was expecting to receive like the title said.
3,not the best quality,"I ended up returning the item, a necklace which I believed could hae been purchased for half what I paid at the local Target.Return policy was good however."
5,Even puts dads to sleep!,"Wonderfully relaxing music with sounds from all over the African continent. Whenever my husband plays this CD for our daughter, they both fall asleep."
5,Would like to review Peplowski's Last swing of the century,How can I review this CD when the tunes aren't listed
5,New Thrash City,"Back in the day, ROIR had a unique concept in producing cassette-only releases of mostly punk and new wave artists which centered on demos, unreleased songs or alternative cuts from previously-issued material. It was a great way for a fan to supplement a collection through authorized releases of rare recordings.But in 1982, the company worked with Dave Hahn - the manager of Bad Brains - to chronicle the emerging hardcore punk scene in New York City. And this classic release continues to pound hard with a vibe from the late-evening streets.Featuring artists like the Beastie Boys - with their first recorded material - Bad Brains, Kraut, The Stimulators and Adrenalin O.D., this is an incredible collection of 24 songs that demonstrates an emerging subculture is knocking down doors and demanding to be heard.One of the best releases from the company, it is a call to arms in New Thrash City."
3,Catholic schoolboys in trouble,"A heady mix of Catholicism, celibacy and homosexuality definitely has dramatic possibility, but I'll take Ken Russell's THE DEVILS over this kind of human-interest drama anyday. There's not enough disrespect in this exploration of the dubious underbelly of an insidious institution. It's a well-made film, but the corrosion of Catholicism is better suited to heavyhanded potboilers these days."
1,Can I give it HALF a Star?,"This product is ineffective at covering stretch marks AND I brought 2 different colors attempting to mix them to match my own complexion. Too cakey and when you put it on, it's obviously makeup. Although it is waterproof ( for sure), most definitely not worth the price I paid. What a waste for and please invest in some waterproof foundation instead before buying this crap."
3,SMILIN' BREW .........,"Now, who is laughing all the way to the bank???It's a very worthy effort from our rapper boy -potent film-making from Curtis Hanson and daring character work from Miss Basinger; but after the fuss has died down [and Oscar noms. are quite in line for this puppy] - let's nurture a career here and see if the acting chops can last past the funk and da noise!"
4,top draw movie.,"... I am not a big fan of eminem,I don't even own one of his albums! I went to see this film coz my mates told me it was a sweet movie!I went with no real expectations of anything special at all,I even doubted his actin ability! But once I had seen this movie, I realised what my mates were chaffin on about! It was so good! Yes he really can act, and not only that he can act extremly well! A very strong performance and an excellnt script. The rapping battles were excellent! The stuff they come out with(especially eminem) is hilarious, and also extremly clever!i don't really want to say anything more about the movie except that you must see it. As long as the swearing doesn't bother you(if it does then T.S. coz thats the way people like that talk!)"
3,pretty good movie,"This was better than I thought it would be. There is a plot, and it is more than just gangsta talk and hip hop. Eminem shows some acting skills in this one as well as his top-notch rhyming skills. This movie is a cool mixture of humor and hard knocks.A couple things bugged me though. The amount of fist-fighting...whats up yo?? Seems like every 5 minutes somebody is beating up someone else. Also, Brittany Murphy's scene-entrances were really odd...she just walks up, seemingly out of nowhere, into whatever situation. She looked kinda hot though."
4,"""I heard you were a dope rapper.""","I hate Eminem. I listen to rock and heavy metal, not rap. I have to admit, this is one good movie. I'm not going to give you a synopsis, because you all know what it's about. I am going to say that the blondie Marshall gave me a movie worth the admission price and that is more than I can say about most movies I have seen lately. I even bought this DVD in spite of being an Eminem hater. I don't care what kind of music you listen to, if you like or hate Em, this is a flick worth seeing. Now."
3,8 Milve VHS review,Good shape movie. Thought I was getting a DVD but it was my first by so I don't know if it was my fault or if there was no DVD or VHS option labeled.
1,Worse Than I Expected,"A bunch of undereducated and unemployed (or underemployed) losers waste their lives (1) either rapping or hanging out with their rapping friends in hope something will rub off on them, (2) riding around aimlessly (3) bemoaning their fates as they do nothing to improve them. It used to be dreams of basketball success that mesmerized so many young black urban males and left them with nothing--apparently now it's dreams of rap music success that ensnare too many young black urban males (along with some young urban white trash) into worthless lives. The whole scene is just pitiful. Eminem can't act, by the way--he has exactly one expression: sullen. After seeeing this movie, I'm more convinced than ever that rap is nothing more than a cute vocabulary-based parlor trick. It's not music, and this isn't much of a movie."
5,8 Mile is one of the best movie of 2002,"Before I saw this movie, I didn't know a lot about Eminem, but when I saw 8 Mile, I saw where this poet of our time came from and it changed the way I looked at Eminem. 8 Mile is the story of a young rapper named Jimmy ""Rabbit"" Smith Jr. who lives on one side of Detroit that is separated by the 8 Mile road. He goes back to live with his mother who lives in a trailer with some kind of loser. He tries to become the champion of rap battles at the shelter,"
4,8 mile,"I was very impressed with Eminem's acting. I hope to see him in other movies soon. I would like to see him in a different type of role. I gave 8 mile 4 stars because I have to acknowledge that this movis isn't for everyone (especially anyone under 17). Eminem is very natural in front of tbe camera and is a natural actor. I have to confess that I have a crush on Eminem as a result of this movie. I can't forget the other awesome performances as well, including Academy-Award-winning Kim Basinger. If you like hip-hop music I can guarentee you will like this movie for the awesome soundtrack alone. I couldn't help bobbing my head and tapping my foot throughout the movie."
5,Hip Hop,Absolutely good movie about how Eminem grew up on the street of Detroit poor with no dad & a substance abusive mom. A very nice feel good story. Really good acting.
4,Very Good,"Everyone has been saying that Eminem is a terrible actor and that people have only been seeing this movie because he was in it. However this movie was actually very good, and still would be no matter who is in it.The only problem was that Alix(Brittany Murphy) wasn't really in it a whole lot, and she wasn't really a big character.Over all this movie was alot better than I thought it would be."
3,WHAT?!?,"They hyped this movie a bit too much I think. From what I had heard I was expecting the greatest hip hop movie of all time. Don't get me wrong, its ok... but not what I'd expected. This movie needed a tad less sex. ... That said, the freestyles in the movie are great. If they would have had more scenes at the Shelter or the Chin Tiki, the movie would have been a lot better. Eminem does have acting skills though, the scenes with his ""little sister"" are touching... or something like that."
2,"Not for everyone, certainly not for me..","To some this movie may be as deep as the Atlantic Ocean, to me it's about as deep as a pot hole full of brown water. Frankly the rap battles became tiresome early on, Brittany Murphy was wasted in a boring role in which she displayed morbid facial expressions while being hunched by Eminem, also Kim Basinger's melodramatic part didn't help matters. As for rap superstar Eminem's acting, it was fine. Believe me I wouldn't have any problems bashing it if it wasn't. I was under the impression that this was sorta based on Eminem's life, it's not. Or if it's supposed to be, it's simply dishonest. So in closing.. if you like rap music with an undying passion or aspire to be a rap artist, ""8 Mile"" may be worth your while. Otherwise ~just say no~.."
1,YUCK!!!,"OKay where do I start?? this movie is horrible,Eminem can-not act at all,it got very long and boring!! I gave it one star cause the only good actors are the little girl and Brittany Murphy,I would not recomend this movie to ANYONE"
5,Farmer does it again!,"Farmer is the best science fiction author of all time and this book is a truly wonderful read!Definitely a book to read more than once, it is rich with adventure, excitement, and deep thought provoking philosophy. Imaging living in a far away future time when the earth is dying as the sun burns out. Society has become primitive again. There are great ideas in this book which is what one expects from Farmer, who has the most brilliant and original imagination ever.If you have ever read ""to your scattered bodies go"" or ""maker of universes"" then you will know what I am rambling on about."
4,An epic sci fi adventure,I first read this novel back in the 80s and had to reread it a few times because there were so many little details I couldn't figure out on first reading. The novel has its weaknesses: the characterization is two dimensional and Deyv in particular is a bit shallow and annoying. But the scope! The universe Farmer built for this novel was mind blowing and so fully realized that it left me in awe. I have re-read the book many times since and it remains one of my favorite science fiction novels.
3,Before you buy you better know this,"Don't be misled by thinking if you buy this booklet you stand to get a job in the US Postal Service. The US Postal Service recently offered a buyout to clerks and mail handlers because of the huge drop in mail volume. It was partially successful but the Service is still overloaded with employees. The Service and the unions are trying to fill vacant positions elsewhere with excess employees with limited success. Layoffs are looming. In other words there are no career jobs to be had. There is also currently a hiring freeze. So while this booklet may be helpful when a test is offered, don't expect it until 2011 or later. You are best off saving your money and passing on this offer."
3,Pure Soap Opera,"It's plum wonderful how this once daring drama remains a classic -- classic trash! The angst of small town dwellers during WWII is depicted glamorousely and juicily. If you strip away the Hollywood excesses there are some pretty tawdry happenings in this picturesque village.Lana Turner is howlingly bad as single mother to a goody-goody daughter. Russ Tamblyn changes from sensitive mama's boy to player so well that one is disappointed to see the direction his character went. Hope Lange looks lovely and manages to elicit the appropriate sympathy.The film is not so over-the-top as to be camp yet, but it takes a strong step in the right direction. The trash value is one better than the 1950's ""Imitation of Life"" but not as delectable as ""Valley of the Dolls""."
1,Will NOT reorder,These underpads are too thin and not very absorbent. Seems like they were higher quality previously. Wanted pads to absorb and not leak through. These pads flunked!
1,UPDATE!,I WROTE A REVIEW WHEN I FIRST GOT THESE AND THOUGHT THEY WERE WELL MADE..NOT!!!! THEY ARE GARBAGE! ALL THE COTTON INSIDE ROLL INTO BALLS..DOESNT KEEP ITS SHAPE. I DEF WILL NOT RECOMMEND TO ANYONE!
4,See the comments,"Pros:Sharp PicturesFast (starting, pictures deleting, ready to shoot after snap)lot of BellsSharp flashGood battery lifeGood priceCons:Macro mode sucks (close up pictures are not great)When pointing towards well lit area LED shows lot of strikescamers-video-playback swtich is badly designed.Doesn't show up as a USB device in windows 2000 (in win XP it does)"
4,Pretty Good Camera,"I think this camera is very good because of it's multiple high-end functions and options when taking pictures are everything you could possibly need. What makes it even better is how you don't have to be an expert to use these functions. This camera is very user friendly and easy to learn thanks to its clean design.However, I have two minor problems. 1) The zoom should be able to take wider shots. This would really help if you are into landscape pictures. 2) The camera is a little large and bulky compared to some of the comparible Casio and Konica-Minolta models with similar or more megapixels.Overall though, I would highly recommend this camera due to its ease and array of options, plus at a great price and amazing lense quality!"
5,Great Compact Camera,Bought this camera for a ski trip and it was awesome. Light and compact to carry in my ski jacket. Took great video too.
4,Lots of features in a small package,"I didn't get exactly what I wanted when I bought this camera, but for the price I got everything I needed. It's small, easy to use, and takes decent pictures. The flash is a bit lacking, as night pics tend to be extra grainy, but it does do an excellent job on outdoor, daytime, action shots. I'm happy with my purchase."
5,Picture perfect,"I love this camera. The problem is that I'm a little challenged technically and I'm still figuring out all my choices, but every picture I take comes out well. It downloads to my mac stuff automatically. Be sure to buy a 1 gig memory card--the one that comes with it is worthless.'"
4,Great depending on the situation,"This camera takes pictures nicely, but my hands cannot hold the camera still for long so when the flash is not on the quality is blurry. But if I use flash and am in sunlight my pictures are clear but are washed out because of too much exposure.Pros:Sleek designCan take out the batteries (so you can charge the battery and still take pictures if you have another battery)Batteries (lasted me a few years before the rechargeable battery has little charge)Buttons are easy to push and useNice quality picturesLCD screen is large enough to see pictures being taken easilyCan take pictures with one handCons:Video mode (no ability to zoom after record has been pressed)Kind of bulky for today's standardUsability (many people do not know that you hold down until it focuses then press the picture button all the way)Overall:Pretty great camera for taking pictures.Some pictures have amazing quality (if conditions are right)."
4,A luck thing jumping price,"I purchased this cam for my wife in 2007, I wanted something inexpensive but gets the job done. I've been buying cannon cameras for years now and this one does not disappoint, picture quality, battery life, size all top notch. I read a lot about lens jamming and expensive repairs, I suggest you get a warranty for it, I guess a few out there are lemons. Oh, I would like to also add, I purchased this camera new for $213.51 on 2/5/2007, the price tag on it now is steep, more then double, no longer and inexpensive camera. At this price I won't buy it again, five stars then, four stars now."
5,Awesome Camera!,"The Canon Powershot Elph SD600 is an awesome, compact piece of machinery. I bought the SD300 two years ago, and this one has a MUCH bigger LCD display, as well as more fun features! My husband has been playing with it and reading the manuel for the past two weeks, and he's STILL finding new things to do! We carried the SD300 all over Europe in 2005, and by the end of the trip we had 356 QUALITY pictures stored on the SD card. I love not having to change film, not having to use the LCD display unless we want to (saves on battery life), and being able to carry it around in a small pouch or pocket! I would recommend this camera to anyone!"
4,Canon is the best,1. I have Canon A75 then now DS600. There is a big difference2. SD600 always in my pocket and not miss any moment I want to shoot3. The performance is excellent. Especially in the night strong flash.4. Battery life is goodweak point1. We need Canon to make indicator for battery.I recommend this product for who needs to keep value camera in his pocketand actually I would like to get SD800
5,Great compact camera for the price!,"I got this one today because I was exchanging my Polaroid one that didn't meet my standards. This one met and went above my expectations. There are so many shooting options, fast charge between photos and beautiful images. I had a Canon A80 so I knew Canon's took great photos. This one is definately a good deal."
3,Poor in low light,"Everything about this camera was great except for shooting in low light. By low light, I mean just a little dark. When I took the camera back, I was told that since it has no image stabelization, the pictures just look blurry or dark. I would suggest that you look at the SD800 or SD900, or at a Panasonic like the DMC-FX3. My old Canon camera took better pictures that this one."
2,poor quality picture at low light levels,"This camera can take good pictures at sunny outside, but no high quality pictures at shadowed area, or interior with window open at daytime, almost impossible to take good quality pictures at low light levels at night, without flash. ISO 800 is a joke, pictures taken are full of dots (noise). Manual control is kind of amateur, especially for exposure and shutter speed.In summary, this is a good small toy at sunny days only."
4,Canon PowerShot SD600 6MP Digital Elph Camera with 3x Optical Zoom is simply good,"Canon PowerShot SD600 6MP Digital Elph Camera with 3x Optical Zoomis simply the best and easy to handle, operate by any one including kids.The features are fine.There is nothing more required for the worth of that price."
3,Some glitches,Delivery was great. It works with some glitches but that's important. When I turn it on viewing screen takes time to clear up.
5,Noooooo regrets...Absolutely none,"I bought this camera for my daughter after reading all the reviews I could. However I finally choose a canon firstly,because they have been making cameras for ages and secondly because I have a Canon AE1 auto for the last 24 years and it works perfectly. never had a problem. From flim to digital had to be canon. I must admit that I have been using it more than the intended user so I will have to get my own."
5,Excellent and Durable Camera,"This camera is my third digital camera. It outshines them (an Olympus C-4000 and a Nikon Coolpix 2500) by far with its quick start-up time, fast shutter lag, and compact size. The second week after purchasing it, I placed it in my pocket with a piece of chocolate. Bad idea! Melted chocolate ended up all over the camera. Fortunately, I managed to scrape off the hardened chocolate and now it works perfectly fine, even though there is still chocolate stuck under the zoom lever. Thank god it's so durable. I have also dropped this camera twice, with no effect on its operation. This camera was built for clumsy, distracted people like me. Bravo, Canon."
5,good better best,"for the price, this is the best I have owned. I buy Canon and like the products. The 600 is the easiest so far. Very user friendly. A good buy."
3,"""Bad Things"" is soo Bad,but not worth my BLOOD","I wanted to buy Jace Everett's CD because I love the song,""Bad Things"" from the true blood tv series.I really wanted to hear the rest of his music thinking he must be someone special,and he must think he is charging 75bucks for a CD."
5,Ghadially: the master of ultrastructural morphology,This is the fourth edition of a one-of-a-kind textbook on the morphology of human and nonhuman cells. It is complete in all aspects and provides informative insight into correlations with form and function of the various cellular organelles. The illustrations are numerous and of extremely high quality.
2,"Much too ""Techno"" for my taste!","This CD takes a great Cuban folk song and turns it into a techno dance number. While some may find that interesting I find it annoying. It does have some value though. The second of three mixes is closer to the traditional sound. And of course, its great if you want to dance to it."
5,Author's review,"This 2nd edition revises and replaces the first edition,and shows my 4 stage house construction project using ICFstyrofoam building blocks. See the lessons learned andmany photos and diagrams and follow the progress of myproject. The house grows from 1,800 sq. ft. to 8,000 sq. ft.But I describe how to convert a cottage into a castle.Follow my journey with my wife to France to search forthe original chateau, and see some of the finished details.stan mazor"
4,"Fun, but easily lost","My daughter really enjoys playing this game, and it is challenging enough to hold her interest for several rounds of play. But there are so many matching chips that are not attached to the game board it is easy to lose some of them."
2,Not what I expected,"I purchased this game for my daughter and expected something much more durable. This is a very cheaply made product and design. I ordered it because my kids love matching games and this looked like a neat idea for the game. I was expecting more of a ""flip"" action and the pieces to be secured to the board while playing - However the game pieces are plastic pieces that you have to put the stickers on and they just lay on the board (which does not ""flip"" very well)."
3,Wood Grain Pattern in Background,I ordered this paper because I liked the harlequin pattern - however beware that there is a wood grain pattern in the background that is difficult to see in the internet image.
4,Great read!,Saw the movie version of the book at the Sundance Film Festival and felt it left me with questions. The first half of the book is similar to the movie but the book goes in a different direction which I really enjoyed. I could not put the book down.
1,Relentlessly Pessimistic,"Reader beware! This is a relentlessly pessimistic novel that does not have a single admirable character and very few redeeming actions. The letter to Osama is a ""cutesy"" device that completely fails to achieve its goal of imagining a futuristic, post 9/11 world because its characters are so horrific, if not psychotic, to start with. It is hard to blame terrorism on the complete unraveling of people who were crazy to start with. There are flashes of humor, and the theme of class warfare is clear, but these do not offset a horrifying point of view."
1,Advanced Strength and Applied Stress Analysis,"I have taught Advanced Strength of Materials at three different universities and without a doubt this is the worst textbook that I have ever used or seen. The text was selected before I started teaching at New Mexico Tech and I did not have time to change before the semester started. There are numerous mistakes in the example problems, the material is never explained in a fashion that the students can understand, the material is badly organized, and the author never states what assunptions are built in to the equations that he uses. A totally unsatisfactory book!!"
3,Complex,"Like others I have found this book rather complex. It's examples are often long and tedious and leave a lot of steps and derivations to the reader. Understanding it requires a very strong maths background. I'm using it for a fourth year university subject. After completing a pre-requisite stress analysis subject, I find the jump between Mechanics of Materials (Hibbeler) to this book a rather large one."
4,Review,"The book was shipped to me in a timely manner, but was a little disappointed with the small amount of water damage. It was not detrimental to the overall use of the book though."
5,Composite Beams in Bending,"Well, I have lots of book and this is one of the books I have in my bookshelf. Obviously I have not read the entire book but I did of course read pages from 302 to 309. I was particularly interested in Composite Beams in Bending and those 7 pages did help me. I am not sure if there were any errors in the mathematical calculations as noted by some earlier reviewer but these 7 pages looked okay to me.www.freesoftware.com.my"
5,"Very Interesting Song, Sung Sweetly","La Rosa is a cute song in which a girl protests mistreatment by men who cheat and then send the girl roses. The song goes on to depreciate the rose as a flower grown with manure (estericol)! Both the English and Spanish version are a pleasure to listen to. I like the tune and the singer's expression. Litzy doesn't show any detectable Spanish accent in the English version. The song is amusing as it proceeds to badmouth other commonly thought desirable things, like the butterfly is just an insect. The most recent song that Litzy has produced is (& I have heard) is Pecadora, a song that should have been the theme song for the telenovela of the same name, a song posted on YouTube.Litzy is an excellent actress whose best performance is probably as protagonist of Amarte Asi, a telenovela for which she also sings the theme song, as she did for Daniela, another of her telenovelas."
3,Suggested for second grade and up,I used this book in a kindergarten class and the students loved looking at the pictures but could not grasp the text. I would suggest using this book for second grade and up to teach about plants growth. The pictures are clear and realistic.
2,Lovely Story Not lovely binding,"The story and illustrations were beautiful.. The binding seemed to cheapen it however.It was more like a library binding than a hardcover which I prefer.If it came with a true hardcover, I would purchase it."
5,Beautiful story,"This is an enchanting Christmas tale of internal beauty and acceptance. It sends a lovely message about generosity, kindness, uniqueness and hope. It also helped my children and I pick a ""not so perfect"" tree when we went to select ours for Christmas. My children pointed out tress that weren't perfect and we selected one that wasn't perfectly shaped and maybe a little crooked. It stands proudly in our living room and is perhaps the most lovely tree we've ever had."
2,"Oh, please.","Even when it was the only color game system out there, Game Gear wasn't worth it. Back then it was expensive, ate batteries and had a limited selection of game titles. Now a days it's simply outmatched by GBA. Forget this dinosaur, unless you're looking to play a certain Game Gear- only title."
5,Better than Game Boy!!,"Where has this game been all my life?? A 4 game boy family, I bought 2 Game Gear this year. Only because it was cheap! Games cheap as well... My 4 kids are constantly playing these, as well as fighting over them. I am going to buy 2 more. I will be selling the game boys. GB has nothing on GG. The picture is large, you can see the detail and play in the dark! (Quiter car rides) It is very much like real arcade games. The only complaint is they take 6 batteries each and only last about a day. I will be finding electric adapters for them! This is a great deal!! My kids ages are 14, 10, 8 and 5, they ALL love it."
4,AH! Memories,"Sad to say this was my best friend for a couple of years. I loved alot of the cheesy and easy games that came with it but the fact at that time that you were able to play Sonic The Hedgehog on a small colored screen seemed unreal back in the day but this electronic item had so may ads and commercials that I thought to myself I needed to get one of these to see what everyone was talking about. Games like Afterburner, Spiderman, and of course, Sonic the Hedgehog were all availabel so after spending the odd 150 bucks on a state of the art hand held video game system I was able to play awesome video games anywhere! (only with the acception that I was carrying over 20 brand new batteries) Besides, with the new Game Boy SP out this is somethign definitely that can be named as the state of the art PAPERWEIGHT!"
3,Sega Game Gear,"You can call this a portable master system beacuse it is 8-bit and it can play master system games with a converter.The main problem I had about this system was that it uses batterys kinda fast. I highly recomend getting a AC Adaptor and a battery pack with this.Remember that this system no longer has new releses (Last game came out in '97). I would also recomend getting a magnifier for it too. Another thing that I wish it could include is a TV Output, like the Nomad and Mega Jet. (16-bit Sega Portable Systems) Overall rateing: 3 1/2 stars"
4,Cuticle cream,The only negative thing I can say about this product is that it doesn't smell very good. A strange smell but fortunately it does not linger too long. It arrived in a timely manner and sure seems to make my cuticles less ragged. I use it at night while i am watching TV and continue to massage it in as well as possible.
4,Great BIG HUGE pie plate!,Emile Henry is fantastic quality product....but be careful when ordering this pie plate....it is 12 inches....not your standard 9 inch. So if you aren't paying attention you will be shocked how big it is when it arrives. I used it to serve little appetizers at a party and it looked really nice in the big pie plate. Great product just HUGE!
4,The Punisher(PS2),Even though it was a used item it seemed to be brand new. This is a good place to buy things from.
1,Wow...so not what I expected.,Either the quality is awful (of the recording) or Frank's voice improved as he aged...I strongly dislike this one. That deep (...) voice I expected to caress my ears...not what I got!
5,FANTASTIC,"This book totally consumed my life, I could not put this book down. It is a real page turner, wonderfully written, I feel as though I knew all the characters in this town, and could visualize each one. The Suicide Club kept me on the edge of my seat throughout.

3,Where's the map,The quality of the book is good.I've seen a copy of the original and the map is an important piece.I wish they could included it.
4,Works Well,"This pizza slicer has worked as well as any other pizza slicer I have used. I'm not sure what all the hype is about. I did have a bit of difficulty with crust (like I always do) and it cleaned about as easily as any other pizza slicer. The only negative is it can be awkward to hold. I feel like it is somewhat dangerous. I'm probably being paranoid, but there you go."
1,Don't waste your money!,Received the slicer on time. I thought it was great at first. In fact I was planning on buying more for Christmas presents. Here is the deal breaker. After only a week I had just washed it and was drying it with a dish towel and It broke right in my hand! Don't buy it! It is a waste of your money!
2,"Good idea, poorly made","We bought this cute little pizza slicer because we make pizza once or twice a week and were drawn to the ergonomic design. The fact that it takes much less space in the drawer is a big plus as well.I'm sorry to say, however, that after 1 use it cracked on the hinge. We superglued it back together and were able to get 3 or 4 more uses out of it before it cracked again on the other side of the hinge and was no longer able to be salvaged. I'm not a very strong girl and am quite sure that the amount of pressure applied was average or below average. This product was a disappointment because we really were looking forward to having it, but we will go back to using our OXO pizza cutter that is metal all the way through and has continued to slice pizzas for many years. I'm sorry that I cannot recommend this product (really wanted to like it)."
5,Fantastic,"Bought one for home and work. Guys at work love it, clean up is great the way it snaps apart. Found it is great for slicing pre-sliced meats and cheese into cracker size pieces also."
5,Great slicer for a great price and a fast delivery,I ordered this just last week and I already received it yesterday! It is perfect brand new condition just as it said it would be. The blade on the slicer is excellent and can cut through the toughest crusts. I ordered it for my brother for christmas and he is going to love it! I'm so glad it came so quickly. I didn't have to worry at all that it wouldn't show up on time. Great product for a great price and a quick delivery!
4,My daughters enjoyed this movie,"cute movie, with laughs. Needs to be followed with parent conversation about following rules and deceit."
2,Wedding band scratches,"When I first received this ring it was beautiful. It stayed shiny for about a month. Now 3 months later, is covered in scratches and no longer shiny. I ended up buying a sterling silver ring for much less money, and it is still scratch free after a month of wear. I was under the impression that 10k gold would not scratch as easily as 14k or 18k. Guess not. I would not recommend this ring, especially for the expense."
3,"Good, not great...","I guess that you get your money's worth for these Headphones(only cost me $7), but that's about it. Their only SLIGHTLY better than the Headphones you'd get if you bought a new Discman or Walkman. The sound quality is alright if you keep it between 4 and 6, but any higher will result in destortion. Don't even think of using these phones to listen to anything that remotely has bass in it, all you'll get is some ugly sounding noises. Also, the Headphones are shaped really wierd, they seem to be made for people with VERY wide heads. All in all, a decent pair of Headphones from AIWA."
1,really bad!,these are the worst headphones i have ever seen i just got them they are meant for people with HUGE heads they are very uncomfortable with a wierd style that you cant see in the one picture
5,If you know or like fairy tales this is the deck for you,"I am 25 years old and I love this deck. If you know any fairy tales, the same ones you read to your children, then this is the deck for you. It is fun and simple to read. This deck makes doing readings fun and easy."
1,If there were a zero I would have given it that,What a huge waste of money. It is a one page document and nothing that I didn't already know from internet searches. I wanted to know if it was worth spending hundreds of dollars for this item.
1,Not complete,I was really upset with this movie. This is my favorite movie and thank goodness I have it on VHS from when it first came out! I bought the DVD and was disappointed that half the movie was gone! This is why viewers were saying the movie was hard to follow!
1,My door broke after 3 years!!,I will not purchase a frigidaire washer again!! I am upset that when I even called they said that I would have to pay someone to fix the door. The striker broke because the door needs to be realigned. Why isn't it durable enough to hold up to it being opened in closed? We don't hang on the door so it should not have to be realigned. Things aren't made like they used to be and its upsetting.
1,Another Disatisfied Mac Buyer,"I 2nd the comments on the incompatability with Mac OS 10.4. I purchased this to share a wireless keyboard & mouse USB set with a Mac & PC and despite what the box says Belkin's $60 switch doesn't work with Mac OS. The installation guide & users manual is a complete joke - Belkin throws in a leaflet on how to install on a mac (a 2-inch by 2-inch single sided set of instructions with 12 steps) as an afterthought to the 20 page PC manual. Not only that, Belkin completely leaves out how to use the software once its loaded on the Mac - low & behold THERE IS NO SWITCH FUNCTION ON THE MAC ONCE THE SOFTWARE IS LOADED. There is a note about using ""ALT+F11"" but that gets no response what so ever. It would be nice if Belkin would release software that actually works as advertised for Mac with this switch!!!!!"
1,Could not get the swtich to work with all computers,"Bought the Belkin switch to connect 4 computers to one printer but some of thesystems would not recognize the device as valid let alone connect to the printer.It would work on some models of laptops (Dell) but not on Sony or HP models. Triedupdated drivers, shorter USB cables, two different makes of printers but nothing would work.Fiddled with the thing for 2 weeks and finally ordered a different unit from IOgear.Got the unit, connected the machines all were recognized with no issues.In the beginning contacted Belkin and they offered solutions to the problem butnone solved it.In retrospect, the IOGear device is a better solution since you canswitch the device with from the computer (with the included software) or push abutton on the switch. The Belkin device only switches from the software."
5,It works... what else is there to say?,"Viking cards always work. Heck, you can leave one in your pocket and do the laundry and they'll keep right on working most of the time. (Yes, I've done that.) What else is there to say about a memory card?"
1,rebate not honored,"I was disappointed that ""Viking"" would not honor the rebate as they said I did not send the UPC code from the package. I felt that I sent all they needed with the Amazon bill? I sent the cut out from the wrapping with a UPC code?"
1,0 STARS: Pure unadulterated trash!,"This movie does not try to be scary, it knows that it is hopeless and pathetic and it is just a complete and utter joke. Nothing scary, atmospheric or moving in any way, shape or form. In fact, even the lame attempts at comedy fall flat. Just a complete waste of time of a movie that is about as scary and as intriguing as watching reruns of ""Gomer Pyle USMC"". Need I say more?"
1,Oh Lord...,"If I see one more shaky cam, first person piece of crap I will throw up... Again. OK people yes, the Blair Witch project was fresh, even entertaining. Can we let this die now please. Cloverfield, quarantine, Diary of the Dead, District 9, stop please. If I wanted to see crap camera work I can watch the news. I searched very hard to come up with any redeeming part of this ""film"", and the only good thing in it is the Amish farmer and he only lasts 5 minutes, after that part, just turn off the movie, you will thank me. Sorry Mr. Romero."
2,More Hand Held camera garbage... disguised as a movie,"Sorry, my movie copy was throw out due to yet another filmaker usinghand held cameras to make a movie... Another blair witch, cloverleafwannabee...I will not watch anything that passes itself as a movie made with handheld cameras...if i want to be sick ill go on a rollercoaster.Shame on George Romero's...going with the flow.The shaky camera will be one of the elements that will bring on the downfall of movies as we know them.The 2 stars are for what i have seen in the first 15 minutes or so...pretty good makeup..."
2,the worst by far,"I hate to give 2 stars to a Romero film but this film is so bad,i love romero satire and criticism but he have to balance this like he did in his first 3 films,they had all that but they were scary too."
1,terrible,just by using that camera technique where the director is depicting use of handheld video camera alone ruins this movie. They need to stop using this method of taping. It does NOT work.The movie itself is terrible if you can bare to watch it.just soo bad in every way. just stay away.
3,Zombified,"This was not quite up to par with some of Romero's other zombie flicks.You could tell that he was on a smaller buget with this film. No name actors and 1990's style of effects made this less innovative then say ""Land of the Dead"" Great Movie!!!. This is not to say that it did not have it's moments. The Undead are in typical Romero form. Effects, other then the CGI where good and realistic. The characters were not over acting or over done. Good tongue and cheek humor. The downside was, since the actors were unknowns, it was hard to identify with any of them. When one got ate I did not feel bad for them. There was no sense of drama that gave his other films a element of seriouness to it. Same locations of rual Pennsylvania that were in his other movies. All in all if you are a Romero fan then this is good to add to your collection. But in a industry that is over saturated with zombies, we needed a movie that re-set that standard. This one did not quite accomplish this."
3,Better than Land of The Dead,I thought 'Diary' was better than 'Land Of The Dead'.Putting aside the films shortcomings it was a fun quick 90 minutes.I am glad the entire movie wasn't done like 'Blair Witch'.But what became of Texas after she took off in the RV at the end?
1,"What happened to the director of ""Dawn of the Dead"" ?",Bad acting . Want to see a good zombie movie ? Dawn of the Dead remains the best of all. Avoid it !!!
3,Mediocre,"I am not big on being trapped in first person view for an entire movie. The acting was okay. The plot was decent, for a zombie movie. There are parts in the movie where the humor, that Romero puts in many of his movies, takes you out of the movie and makes the whole situation feel very fake.""Everyone is dying around us, we only have limited power, let's use it to keep YouTube up.""The remake of Dawn of the Dead is the new standard for zombie movies (although not perfect itself). Since then, Romero has not really even come close."
3,Least does not mean bad,"While this is easily Romero's worst Zombie film I was happy to see that it is still an interesting, well done movie. No- its not as good as DAY or DAWN or even LAND OF THE DEAD but it is far from the crapfest that I'd been led to believe. I would say that if you like his earlier movies I would think you'd enjoy this one but I've heard so many negative comments on DIARY that might not be true. I suggest seeing it for yourself. Its not perfect but its not bad."
2,Larger? I dont think so.,Not very happy with this purchase. They are very inexpensive but I'll never use them so it doesn't matter. I bought these because I thought they would be a cheaper Magnum alternative but they are way too tight. I saw the words larger and thinner and just ran with it but I wasnt pleased. I've never used Durex prior to this and wont in the future. I should have stuck with what I'm used to.
1,Broken Box,"Item arrived just as described when I brought it. The problem was with the storage box. The clear plastic storage box was broken and someone had taped it shut, because it wouldn't close by itself. I believe that the seller knew about the broken box before it was shipped since it was taped shut. This is very unprofessional on their part."
1,piece of crap,Save your money. This not much better than one you can pick up at the dollar store. Not to mention the cheap a$$ lid broke first time I opened it.
4,A Good Retrospective of the ABBA Phenomenon,"Through interviews with the members of the group, this DVD does a good job of showing the rise of one of the greatest pop groups of all time. Songwriters Bjorn Ulvaeus and Benny Anderson take you through how the group got its start, how they wrote the songs, and talk about some of the strife near the end of their run. The only member who doesn't appear on screen for her interview is Agnetha Faltskog (the blonde). She does a voice over of scenes of her walking near her home. She's pretty much a recluse now. The brunette, Anni-Frid Lyngstad, provides some interesting insight into how the girls saw their role, and their relationship to each other. The DVD also goes into the current stage play ""Mamma Mia"", which Ulvaeus and Anderson re-arranged the ABBA songs for. This is not a ""greatest hits"" DVD, as I see another reviewer was looking for, but rather a career retrospective."
5,The Winner Takes It All - The ABBA Story,"Have loved ABBA from the 70's. I have all their music on tape and CD but only ""ABBA Number Ones"" and ""Mamma Mia"" on DVD. Though I would add to my collection."
3,Everything tests 10K,"I bought this kit. It arrived quickly, and the price was right. The acid for 14K seems to work okay, no problem, the line on the stone does not disappear, so I know it is 14K. But the 10K acid will not work. It tests everything as being 10K, even costume jewelry I know is not, which is disappointing because you can't trust it. I don't know whether this is because the acid is mislabeled, old, or what. Has anybody else had this problem, or have a solution to it?"
3,gold test,"i wish to stone was a little longer so you could test more things at once, otherwise it's fine and a good value"
1,Bad Acid Man!,"I should have listen to the review that said the bottles weren't labeled correctly, I hope all who are considering buying now listen to me. These acids are not mixed right!!! Do not buy! I scratched with known and tested 14k gold and the 10 and 14 acid made the gold line disappear. Perhaps as the other review stated the other bottles have the 10 and 14 labeled as 18, 22, silver or platinum but at $1200+ an ounce do I really take a chance? I hope Amazon stops dealing with such an unscrupulous vender."
4,An alchemist's dream.,It was purchased for another and I cannot comment on the quality............sorry. I'll let you know if I hear more.
4,Using it as a preventative...,"My Lab is getting older, he's about 8 right now, and I figured I'd start him on some Glucosamine supplements to help keep his joints in good health for as long as possible. I read from some other reviewers that their dogs didn't like the tablets and wouldn't eat them. Mine practically eats the quarter sized tablet whole! (And to think I was worried I might have to put some peanut butter on it to make it tasty for him!) So far there have been no problems with him taking them, he actually considers them treats. I plan on keeping him on these tabs long term, so hopefully he'll have good mobility for many more years. :)"
5,Classics that were made before me.,"Its a good CD that contains 7 classics created by namco, the games are pacman,galaga,rally-x,new rally-x,pole position,boscanian,and toy pop! You can also walk around the museum and do some cool stuff,yet there isn't any analog controls for this game which makes it a tad difficult, but overall I give this game a 5 out of 5."
3,great,cool video game great if you still have a PS and plays with all ages and genders.It's a lot of fun for everyone.
4,matrix 2 and 3,Great addition added to my blu ray collection. Not as good as the first one but it rounds out the story.
1,Two Big Bloated messes for the Price of One!,"While the original Matrix film was pretty good, these sequels are among the worst things the Hollywood machine has ever produced. They just drag on and on with more and more CGI piled on to bore you to tears. What a waste. Yes, the freeway battle was pretty cool looking, but it doesn't matter when you simply don't care what happens to the cardboard ""characters"". I'm glad these are packaged together so I only have to avoid them once."
1,The only way to stop cropping.,"The only way we can stop Warner Bros. from cropping all of their cartoon releases is not to buy cropped cartoons like the ones on this DVD, which would be excellent otherwise. If you've already bought it, return it! I did."
1,I guess I wont be buying them either,"After reading about how these cartoons where cropped, I guess I won't be bothering to buy them either (I bought all the golden collections). Thanks to everyone so far who has written in to report this. I will wait for a proper release before I give them my money"
4,A Truman Biography With A Different Twist,"""Plain Speaking"" is a Truman biography with a different twist. Based on interviews of Truman by Merle Miller in preparation for an anticipated television series, it is expressed, largely, in Truman's own words. As such, it is as Truman saw himself and the world.Arranged chronologically, the reader is taken through this remarkable life, the challenges Truman faced and his views on issues and personalities. On these pages we read Truman's uncensored opinions on MacArthur, Ike, Marshall and generals in general, Dean Atcheson, Richard Nixon, the presidency and a host of other topics. Here we learn his conviction that the U. S. has never had a crooked president and that ""The only thing new is the history you don't know.""There are other, better, first biographies to learn the facts of Truman's life. Turn to ""Plain Speaking"" to meet Harry Truman."
2,"HW ok, user interface under Mac OS X is poor","In short it works, however ... the software under Mac OS X is very poor. To switch between the computers sharing the USB peripheral you need to have the software running, it uses space in your Dock and you still have to use a hot-key sequence. There is no menu option in the user interface to do the switch, and no help menu. In fact the entire user interface is quite unprofessional, the ""About"" menu is ""About Hello"" ???, which brings up a window with hello, hello, hello .. They don't even provide the manual or a README on the CD."
2,"""Engineering an Empire"" with different title","This product is the History Channel's ""Engineering an Empire: Egypt"" television show repackaged with a different name. It's a good historical look at building technology in Ancient Egypt and has great CGI to accompany the explanations, but it's not new content. I'd buy the Engineering an Empire episode off of iTunes instead and save $10 or more."
1,Candidate for Worst Movie Ever!,"This has got to rank as the worst movie I ever saw! Very bad acting from the start that gets worse as it goes along, no plot, and a totally ridiculous theme. I agree with the other commenter who said, ""don't waste your money"", and think that the person who gave this movie 5 stars in their review must work for the producer or be related to someone in the movie. I am glad I only spent $1 to rent this, but it was 100 pennies too much!"
1,Not So Hot,The timer is hard to program and I have programed sport watches etc. The timer alarm is so low that the pill box has to be right next to you. The mechanism is set to military time (24 Hr) All in all CHEAPIE
2,Jumbled: Read the book instead,"I absolutely loved the book this movie is based on. It was riveting, and incredibly layed out. I was looking forward to this movie but when I finally saw it, I was disappointed.The movie glosses over the most known points and leaves out the carefully layed out timeline that is in the book. Furthermore, all the old black&white; clips scattered throughout this movie is both strange and inappropriate.I highly recommend the book instead of this movie. I am very disappointed."
2,"""Hunting of the President"" missed the mark","The material was powerful, Morgan Freeman's delivery was great. However, the cartoon/old movie clip material was frustratingly off-point and distracting. What could/should have been an analysis of the political dealings of the right wing of the Republican party and a wake-up call to America, became an erratic difficult-to-follow series of interviews. I was disappointed."
2,Not worth the money.,"I am highly unimpressed. This album is not worth 5 dollars. I was really excited when i heard this was being realeased. Just to be dissapointed, the songs are boring.. very boring... Actually, i didnt like any of the songs except Brain Bypass and Get your Body Beat....My advice, don't buy this album."
1,Someone call 1996,"call 1996, it wants its techno back.This entire CD is sold as a ""cool lyrics"" gimmick to 15 year olds with $15 left from their allowance money.The same beat is in almost EVERY song, ITS EVEN THE SAME TONE.This band is played out, but promoters push this lame garbage on us & its all we're told we can buy.If you want this, get it from one of ""those other"" places and not pay for it. Nobody in the process from making the music, producing, recording, marketing, or selling or reselling it deserves a penny.Keep paying for crap like this, and thats all youll ever get."
3,Just Buy The Dying Daylights!,"I'm a big fan of Charon, I have all of their albums, but I can't say I recommend this one. The song ""Religious/Delicious"" is on their album The Dying Daylights. And the song ""The King Is Dead"" is not worth $11. Charon is by far the best goth rock out there, but buy The Dying Daylights or Tearstained instead."
4,Good Stereo For The Price,"I was looking for a good, inexpensive stereo with decent sound and this one fills the bill nicely. Easy to set up, interesting styling and a really cool automatic door cover on the CD player. The sound is quite good although it won't blow out any windows down the street, but I was never into that anyway.I especially like the auto-channel seek feature for the AM/FM radio. Big timesaver.My one demerit is that it feels a bit flimsy. If it had a bit stronger construction I would have given it five stars instead of four. Still, with care it should last for a good while."
5,Micro Radio/CD player,"Wow! What a great little system. Sounds terrific, doesn't take up too much space, gets in a radio station which for most radios is full of static (my public radio classical station). I am really pleased!"
4,very good,"generally it's very good. Including a remote control, it's a great product out of products under average of $100. I felt, because of the limitation of its two speakers, the sound can't be too good."
3,Boring,"I am a hugh fan of the Drudge Report, but this books seems to have been more of a ""cash-in"" type thing, it really doesn't offer much of anything unless you enjoy reading AIM conversations, Drudge talking to his cat, and other occasional things of ""substance."" Reccomended only for die hard fans of Mr. Drudge"
2,Drudge: Good website. Bad Book.,"While I am a usual reader of Drudge's website which often tells stories that are hard to find or ""discovered"" before they are released to the general public, Drudge's book, however, is poorly written, hard to digest at times, and is just a bunch of rants of all the things he doesn't like in the world. I Just expected better from someone who I admire in some ways."
1,Don't buy 'til you read this...,Quick review... read Drudge's thoughts from his free Web site or radio show... not from this book.I couldn't get past the first few sections and returned the book.It's a shame because I love his Web site.Always a pleasure to inform you!Markus Allen
4,Great book for track geeks and curious runners,"This is a great book for those who care to know more about how the American greats have trained. Mark Bloom ranked the 30 best American men and 20 best American women, then proceeded to write a brief (2 page) bio for each one, followed by a page detailing their training habits. Some of the bios (Gerry Lindgren) are amazing and the training schedules are pretty useful for getting new ideas or getting some insight into what it takes to be a great runner. I don't agree with all of his rankings, but at the same time, I can't say that he was unreasonable either. Also, the book quite nicely refrains from preaching (""this is what you need to do"") and just tells a nice little story for each runner. Definitely a worthwhile addition to a runner's library."
1,Many songs completely unknown,"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000Q7ZNXQ/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_titleI only liked the first CD, the rest maybe are good to the die hard fans of Folk Music. For the money I paid I should like at least 50% of all songs, for my taste I do not get not even the 25%. Check every song before you buy it."
5,Excellent product.,I have found this product to be easy to install and as effective as the brand duo. A grand savings for this tightwad!
3,Canon PG-40 & CL-41 Remanufactured Ink Cartridges,"I ordered both the CL-41 (color) and PG-40 {black} cartridges and they arrived within a few days. The price was much better than OEM products. When the black ink cartridge finally emptied, I installed the replacement one. It seems to print fine; no leaks, no skips. The only downside is that my Canon printer does not recognize it, so it does not give indication of how full/empty it is. I will give a report later on when the color cartridge is replaced."
4,"Not as good as ""Who the Devil Made It?""","I enjoyed this book, but it is not as good as some of Bogdanovich's past writings about Orson Welles, or his compilation book on directors, ""Who the Devil Made It?"". This book has a more ""gossipy"" quality than academic feel to it. For instance, according to a recent book about Jimmy Stewart; Kim Novak denies ever having an affair with Jimmy Stewart as Bogdanovich claims here. She said that he was married, and that she was in love with the director of ""Bell, Book & Candle"", Richard Quine, while she was working on that movie. She also denied the affair during Hitchcock's ""Vertigo"". However, if you are wanting to read a book that has first person accounts with Hollywood's finest movie actors I recommend this book. (I believe the only person that Bogdanovich writes about that he never personally spoke with is Marilyn Monroe.)"
3,Not Quite Award-Winning,"First the negatives about the Peter Bogdanovich's WHO THE HELL'S IN IT. The title is awful and misleading. This is not a book that focuses on the movies that particular stars made. Rather, it centers on Peter Bogdanovich's relationships with various stars from the late 50s through the start of the 21st century. Second, the chapters are very uneven given both the subject matter (Ben Gazzara as a great actor! Has he seen ROAD HOUSE?) and Bogdanovich's wooden writing style.But, thankfully, some of chapters are endearing (John Wayne, James Stewart, and especially Cary Grant ) and Bogdanovich's love of all things movies comes through clearly. Not nearly as good as WHO THE DEVIL MADE IT, but still something for Hollywood bluffs to enjoy."
2,Not a very good mill.,"My wife and I received a pepper mill that looks exactly like this one for our wedding 38 years ago and it's been a great mill. I bought this one thinking it would be the same and we needed a backup. It's not. In the 38 years, they've managed to make a mill that looks just like our old one and doesn't grind pepper worth a damn. You have your choice between grinding half peppers or a grind so fine you can't see it. I took it apart and can tell no difference between the two mills, but there's really a great difference. The old one infinitely adjusts between coarse and fine and you don't have to crank the handle forever to get all the pepper you want. The new one is pretty much worthless. I wouldn't buy another one like this. I just hope the old one lasts another 38 years."
5,"RIO is ""UNBELIEVABLE""","""Unbeleivable"" is the best CD yet by the 6 guys of RIO. Every song could be a hit. The one I like the best is ""I'd thought I'd seen everything"".They are a great bunch of guys who don't always get recognition they deserve. If you want to listen to a great country CD, this is the one to get. It is awesome!!!!"
3,TOLSTOY IN SEARCH OF AUTHENTICITY,"Henri TroyatTolstoy(Garden City, NY: Doubleday, 1967)(New York: Crown, 1980; paperback) 762 pages(ISBN: 0374980101)A biography of Leo Tolstoy, exploring the many passionate causeshe espoused during his long life:the quest for religious truth,the education of the peasants on his estate,love and hate for those closest to him.Tolstoy clearly poured himself into his writings.Whether or not we agree with his conclusions,we can admire him as a man who sought his own Authenticityeven when this led him to go decisively againstthe expectations of his peers and his culture.Some other biographies of persons in quest of greater Authenticitywill be found on the Internet: ""Authencity Bibliography"".James Leonard Park, existential philosopher"
4,Norse Myths with a Sci-Fi twist!,"Wonderful retelling of the Norse/Tuetonic/Icelandic Myths. The entire series reads well, Drakes wording has interesting twists and clever phrases. Plenty of action and intrigue."
1,Strange,"I only bought this because I love Viggo Mortensen, but it is a strange movie and I have watched it twice and still don't get it. But does not stop me from buying more of his stuff. He's easy on the eyes."
2,Six Degrees of Unbearable Chaos,"I will not buy any other DT album unless the ""vocalist"" leaves the band for good. This LP is a circus show.That's all.If you are determined to listen to it anyway, try to listen to it in karaoke, so that you can avoid the vocals. Good for practising musician. Go get ""When Dream and Day Unite"" and forget this one."
1,The emperor is not wearing clothes,"After following these guys since their first album, I have heard them offer new and exciting ideas - until Falling Into Infinity. Since then they've leveled-off compositionally and lyrically. At times the music on this work smacks of Pantera or Pink Floyd. And while no other band beats them when it comes to the chops, I have to say that they would be better off allowing some of their former producers back into the studio to help them regain the vintage, glorious Dream Theater sound they once produced."
4,WOW,I would pass up a night of intense candlelit passion with my beautiful young wife to listen to just the second disc of this set. Now do you know what I mean by WOW ????
3,It's good but.....,"It's too nu-metal influenced. The lead guitarist in my band, who does like Dream Theater, decribed it as a complex Sevendust.I can see where he's coming from. I thought the same thing! The fisrt song is OK, i hate it when they have turntables scratching. Other than that, it's a good album. This is mostly for fans of Dream Theater, not for fisrt-timers. Images and Words kicks the s**t outta this one."
4,Sorry dream theater!,Ooh ooh my turn to rate this album.Basically for this album it all comes down to the 2nd disc. Oh sure there might be a few times where it can become rather awesome on the first disc (what I'm thinking is John Myung's glass prison) anywho 2nd disc is what I got this for and I don't regret this buy!
4,GOOD MUSIC,"I hate people who think of themselves as music critics....What is the problem with you guys... just let the music flow! It's not what you had expected... but it's their music.Some people said: ""no guitar solos"".... what about misunderstood, the great debate or goodnight kiss's amazing solos?Other's said: ""Portnoy is losing it"" what?! his drumming is overwhelming throughout the entire CD.It's probably not their best cd... but don't tear it down with critisism.I agree with some people that said that the mixing is not good..., I don't like it either. But the sound is there.I agree with people that said that there should be some shorter tracks.... absolutely.But if you listen to this CD and are not amazed buy the music wizardy they show, and the musicianship.... you know nothing about music.It is an extraordinary album, period."
2,Worst since FII,Even FII had some redeeming value... this album is terrible. Dream Theater has lost the feel that Kevin Moore gave them and Jordan is no saviour. The songs meander off without a goal.
2,Good for about 2 listens,"Then this album becomes one giant snore fest. The style throughout the album is the same, the songs are so blast beat laiden that it almost dosnt register that your at the next track. The vocals are probobly the best part of the cd there very good. The drumming tho I love most of hellhammers work is boring. Not a recommended album."
5,NOTE: YOU MAY NOT SUE FOR INJURIES FROM LAUGHING.,"...and you might get some! Daniel Pinkwater is dangerous, and pounding-on-the-floor, side-splittingly, head-achingly, losing-your-breath funny! Pinkwater is unique, because he writes in a way no one else can. (See Jules Feiffer's foreword for more info on that.) Just when you think you're sure a certain thing absolutely is going to happen, something else, something REALLY, REALLY WEIRD happens instead. He's unpredictable -- and so funny ya won't believe it till you read it. And none of his jokes are obscure enough to confuse me (an 11-year-old), just surprising and unexpected. Don't doubt me. Just take my word for it that there will always be something special and important missing in your life if you don't get this book."
1,JUNK I should have read the reviews,I used it ONE DAY and the front seam came apart and continued to unravel from that point on. I would have thought this thing would last more than a day. I am sorry I bought it. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS.....[...]
1,Not what I thought it would be...,"We were expecting MORE of a cushion-feel to this seat, but all its really made of is a mesh fabric with little wires inside it to keep air flow moving. It would be okay to keep your butt cool maybe, but for a cushion, its flat and cheap feeling. As for ""king size"" it barely covers our car's seat...we ended up returning them...not worth it..."
5,Great Gift Idea,I ordered this for a book baby shower present. I thought this was a nice item to have for a new family to have to add to the wonder of Christmas.
1,Correct words in song?,Hallmark has yet to answer to their incorrect version of the song in the 2001 edition by Simon & Schuster. The words are mixed up at the end.
5,"Beautiful Illustrations, Poetic Text","This will quickly become a favorite! Beautiful illustrations are matched with poetic text about rural life and the value of family. We love reading about Eli's family members' favorite places on their farm, and how he spends his days with them on it. This is a heartwarming tale of nature, family, and love."
4,well done and catchy,"Before I bought this album I had owned ""Thanks for the Ether"" and nothing compares to the first release. Rasputina have returned and with a bit of metal too. I like that they have more drums and melody, where in the first album they were more mellow. It seems like they are striving to appeal to a more youthful audience. I remember Melora Creager saying that she used to have 60 year old men come to her shows and listen to her music, well, since the latest release, I am sure things have changed drastically. Rasputina is changing, but I must say not for the better. They need to make another turn before they stop at the house."
1,horrible reading,"This was the most awful book I've ever been forced to read, and about 90% of my classmates would agree! It was extremely hard to follow and very dry. I was actually angry about spending money on it!"
2,Be Discerning,"Best read by an intelligent person who can apply appropriate filtering of the far right content. It's a good diet to try, but I would suggest a trip to the doctor first to be sure you can handle it. Hypoglycemics, beware. This diet requires very careful planning and shopping."
3,Worth the read.,"This is a fairly entertaining book that established Clarke as ""the inventor of the communications satellite."""
4,"My first Sci-Fi, now my daughter's","This book was my first introduction to Sci-Fi. Recently in cleaning out the garage I found that book (copyright 1952), rather tattered and torn. My 8 & 6 year old asked me to read it to them for a bedtime story. Although some big words for the kids, it does get their imaginations going. The technology sounds familiar, and the plot can plod along - but it's got the excitement for a younger generation just getting away from books with pictures."
4,A great start,My first sci-fi book. Embedded in my memory. Bought by a parent at a rummage sale some time around the early 70's. Lost it. Now I've ordered it for my 8-year old son (who reads more than I do).
5,"Murder, assorted mayhem, and black magic-what's not to like?","A good read, the author has constructed an interesting new paranormal race - the Angelini. The heroine is an Angelini with no knowledge of her past and incomplete knowledge of her powers or needs who spends her time as a hunter for justice. Justice she sometimes administers... As the story progresses she finds her mates - one is a human cop who is not happy with her breaking the laws and exposing herself to danger, the other is a vampire who is not happy about the exposing herself to danger part or her ability to throw off his thrall. Neither of them is happy about sharing...The plot involves missing girls and wannabe vampires... along with murder, assorted mayhem, and black magic. And, oh yeah, neither the cop nor the heroine believe in vampires...The Angelini series:Skye's TrailSyndelle's PossessionMystic's Run"
4,Baseball Bible,"I got this book for Christmas and it helped me through the long cold offseason! Josh and Kevin painstakingly researched all the stadiums including great seating suggestions, history of team and stadium, trivia and just great in-depth information.The book is as much about the area around the park in the city and a great love of baseball and humorous anecdotes.Very enjoyable for those that love baseball and ballparks. I am excited to get to some new parks and compare my opinions this season!"
5,Even Me CD by Lecresia Campbell,"I purchased this CD several years ago from Amazon.Com and it was ""misplaced"" by a family member. I was extremely disappointed because this CD is no longer available. I was happy to locate another copy on Amazon.Lecresia Campbell is one of my favorite gospel artist and to my knowledge, ""Even Me"" is her only solo project. She is a gifted and anointed singer and has a range that far exceeds many gospel artists in her class.I have several favorites on this CD. If you like gospel music, I highly recommend anything with Lecresia Campbell on the project. I hope she will do another solo project in the future."
5,Fascinating,This book will give you a fascinating insight into the life of one of the most powerful men in Chinese history. A must read for any serious students of Chinese history.
5,This CD is awesome and upbeat.,"I bought this CD a while back. I have listened to it over and over and over. The song ""Jesus Is"" is one of my favorites and ""My God"" gives hope to those who are about to give up. I truly recommend this for everyone on your Christmas list. I can't say enough about this CD. I bought it not having heard a single song on the CD. I have NOT been disappointed AT ALL."
4,Consistent high quality from the Point of Grace,"For months ""Love Life and Other Mysteries"" has been one of my favorite albums. I was very anxiously awaiting this new release. On whole I think it is very good and very well produced. The title song ""Steady-On"" is absolutely a killer track. I couldn't get past it for days I would replay that song.The record is produced by Brown Banister who has produced for Amy Grant for years. The music tends more toward synthizers and is more pop than that last album. I prefered the production on Love Life and Other Mysteries which was more open and featured more guitars. The girls wonderful harmonies have to compete with the big production on this new album.This is still an outstanding album that proves once again that contemporary Christian music has achieved a level of quality that is as good as or better than anything available in mainstream music."
2,missing key scenes,"I had heard many good things about 'Invincible Armor', and was happy to find this video on Amazon.com. I watched the video with somebody who had seen it before, however, and he pointed out that in this edition, at least 2 key fighting scenes have been abruptly deleted-- including one scene pictured on the back of the box, and the final scene explaining the armor's fatal weakness. The story doesn't make sense without these elements."
5,Rare -- get it if you can,"I am lucky enough to already have this, bought it at a bargain price several years ago. The unbelievable range of her voice -- multi-octave -- and the richness of her quiet passion make ""A Taste of Honey"" (both the individual song and the CD) one of the most haunting experiences in music. I saw her in person a few years ago and this was the song everyone waited for. ""Try to Remember"" is a close second as a song that sticks with you long after the CD has ended. Morgana King is not for everyone -- I'm not much of a jazz fan but she is in a category of her own. I personally prefer her soulful songs to her upbeat rhythms but I'll take any of her songs, any day."
5,One of the best,"I bought this book several years ago and have read and re-read and re-read it more times than I can count. Fiction, yes, but when you read it, you feel that you're honestly getting to know Jesus. The book isn't on my bookshelf now, but in the drawer of my bedside table for the next re-read. I have a Kindle now, and wish so very much that the publisher would make the book available as an e-book."
5,great compilation of lesser known surf music,".........my title says it all. Great stuff here by some of the lesser knowns. But great nevertheless. If you like surf music, get this. I probably have over 70 CD's of surf music and this is one of the best. 'Nuff said."
3,Over the Top,"Because I am interested in the metaphysical world myself, I began to read this book with great enthusiasm. I will admit I found the first part of Sylvia Brown's life to be quite fascinating and enjoyable reading, but as the book delved further into her life and her beliefs about the spiritual world I began to feel I was misled. Sylvia Brown's ideas and beliefs about the 'other side' are a little over the top and seem to be the product of an over active imagination. The more I read, I became convinced that there was more science fiction going on in Sylvia Brown's psyche than spirituality...."
3,Entertaining but not for true seekers,"This book succeeds in entertaining. Unfortunately, if one is looking for answers to the ""meaning of life"", Sylvia claims to have the answers but, in reality, she is enteraining you.The best thing about Sylvia is that she speaks in a straight-forward manner. She could be an honorary New Yorker. If you have seen her on TV or in person, she is very up-front and engaging. She writes like she speaks.This work is an effort to convince you of her view of the other side. If you bite, she'll even do a reading for you ... very costly!Listed as non-fiction... but it would be difficult to discern if it is another marketing tool or truth.This book gave me the distinct impression that it is more about profitting Sylvia and less about giving me truth."
2,Life on the Other Side,"I started reading this after a friends husband died and she read it. My husband had died 2 years prior so I bought it. It was slow reading at first, partly due to my time constraints. During my reading, I had the chance to see Sylvia Browne in person in Phoenix. I was very disappointed wth her 'talk.' I have stopped reading the book. I just don't have much interest in it since I didn't care for her after seeing her in person. You may enjoy it but I just didn't click with it."
5,WONDERFUL...,A friend recommended this book to me when I was going through a difficult time with my mother. I know in my heart that what Sylvia writes about is true. What insight! May you find the comfort and peace with this book that I have found...
3,Overated,"I am dissapointed with this game. It does not feel as comfortable as Far Cry, Ghost Recon or Call of Duty. In Fear, it feels like I am moving like a Tank versus a sports car. Maybe it takes some getting use too. The weapons sounds are not that impressive either. It is missing the feel of a real gun shot. I felt like I was shooting marbles. It also feels like I am trigger happy. This game is definitely overrated."
4,Noisy Fun,Most of the people that wrote bad reviews of this album are Bad Religion fans. This is a great noise core album similar to Melt Bananna or Spazz but with and added layer of noise. This album proves that the vocals are just another instrument in the musical bulldozer of power violence
1,So...,"If being innovative with music requires you to play really fast and make a bunch of stupid noise, then give me a record contract, cause I'll make something SO BAD YOU WON'T BELIEVE IT. It'll be perfect... We'll start with a speedy 2/4 beat and then go over to my keyboard and mash 7 random keys together with an effect that screeches terribly. Then we'll change to a 5/4 and add some downtuned guitar to play the first two frets REALLY FAST. Then we turn on 4 different effects pedals and make the guitar feed back. Vocals... we need rapping, and some guy that exhales constantly. More time signatures are needed to get us some respect, so we'll have to swap through 12/4 and 7/16 until the song is over 15 seconds later. I'll make 19 other similiar songs and then sell them to kids in Seattle! Yeah, don't buy this album because it isn't music at all..."
1,Wow,"When I saw ""wow"", I mean ""Wow, could these guys get any worse?"" I seriously think this is a joke. I really think these guys sat down and said ""Alright, let's make the worst music imaginable, because somebody will think we're musically creative. Some idiot out there will think we're innovative and talented."" I'm not sure that these guys even know how to play their instruments, to be honest. I saw them live, of course they were opening for another band, and I almost walked out of the club because I just couldn't stand to listen to them ""play"". When the bassist said ""OK this will be our last song for tonight,"" I couldn't help but thinking, ""Those were all songs? Those 30 second to one minute long noises were songs?"" They're that bad."
1,"''This is sooooo original and technical,dude''","Seriously....what are people thinking when they say ''this is amazing...it is a work of art''.Please.When I heard them for the first time,it reminded me of my high school days....walking past the special ed room and hearing them on ''musical instrument day''.That's how bad it is....I mean...can someone REALLY explain how this is music?Everyone who likes them just says noncredible garbage,such as ''you don't get it'' or ''they have weird time signatures''....Wow....slamming on a synthesizer..soooooo technical!!Seeing them on a live DVD at my friend's house was even worse.The drummer seemed to be imitating Animal from the Muppets. The guitarist made Korn's guitarist seem as if he was a virtuoso.Please...like a band for the music...not because it is ''br00tal,dude''...or ''it's not following trends like everyone else.NEXT!"
3,Heavy handed,"Usually Townley's novel are kind of funny and a little over the top. I adored her first book but thought he second was a little boring.This one does not feel so much like a chick lit novel to me. Yes, there is the requisite single girl and the mother and the misunderstandings with the dad, but this book felt more heavy handed to me. Like the author did not know what to do next and went into a different direction.The result is a so-so novel. A bit on the ""yeah right"" side. I had a lot of problems accepting the basic premise which is that our main character applies and gets into an MBA program cauz her mom told her she had to do it in order to help world peace. Its okay as a library rental - don't spend the money to buy this one."
2,Not color as pictured,"Works OK, and price is certainly right, but the radio I received was grey rather than orange as ordered. Wanted the bright color for an emergency kit. Disappointed I didn't receive what I ordered! Will keep because it works as advertised."
4,wonderful singing,"As the editorial reviewer pointed out, this is indeed gorgeous singing. Her voice is passionate yet balanced, never compromising vocal acuity for heart-on-sleave emotion. Piau is a very promising singer whom we will probably hear much more of soon. However, at times this album does give the impression of being more of a exhibition of virtuosity than a recital (even they are usually the same)."
2,Not recommended for little boys with bad aim!,"We were given this potty chair as a gift. My son will ask to sit on it, but as soon as he does, he'll start to whimper, because it's just too uncomfortable. The couple of times he's stayed long enough to actually go potty, he has leaned back, and scooted his bottom forward, making the little splash guard on this seat useless! He pees right over the top of it, and it gets all over the floor. This will NOT work for us! I'm searching for a better option."
1,Too small and unstable,I just bought this potty for my 34 month old son. He does not like it one bit. As soon as he tried to sit down on the potty it moved under him. He is unable to sit down on it by himself. It is very unstable for larger kids.
2,Not so great simple design,"We purchased this potty seat online and couldn't wait for it to arrive. My 19 month old daughter instantly tried to sit on it and fell into the pot- the rim around the pot part is very narrow, and therefore there is really no place for the child to sit, so she ends up in a weird squatting position. Also it does not have rubber feet so it slides around on the tile. The ""pee guard"" is not detachable, and she gets hooked on it everytime she tries to sit, which shifts the pot too, and sometimes even lifts it out when getting up. The whole thing seems very unstable and she has given up on it. As you can imagine, we have too. We are going to try a potty that has a seat with a bowl that fits underneath."
5,Simple is better,"This is the best toilet seat. The fancy ones with all the parts are always falling apart and difficult to clean; the ones with removable pee gaurds are annoying (the ppe gaurd is always getting lost). It is a great height for most kids so their feet are not dangling (if the knees are not up a little it makes it hard for them to have a stool). After flailing with the ""bells and whistle"" ones we now have our two useing this one! Good luck! p.s. I also like the idea of the black basin but our also came all white but that is ok with us."
4,"Great SF from the era, but Verne would gag watching it","I saw this movie for the first at the cinema - yes, I was only 9 years old, but I still remembered parts of it years later - mostly the underwater city, Templemer. Remember - it's a model, not computer effects. The movie is a blatant attempt to capitalize on Verne and Nemo - just call it ""The Underwater City"" and leave Nemo out of it. It works better that way.It's still one of my favorite flicks from the 1960's and would be in my top 50 SF film list. Classic SF fan? You have to see this! I think Vincent Price would have been a better Nemo.Here's a bit of trivia - you probably know Nemo translates as ""no name"" - what was the characters ""real"" name? Prince Dakkar."
3,Wanted it to be better,"Decent film but lacks the charm and budget of Disney's 20,000 Leagues Under The Sea. It has the distinct feel of a made for TV production even though it was a theatrical release. This was a Brittish, not a Hollywood, production; [erhaps that has something to do with it. Maybe it is unfair to compare the two films but in reality what I wanted was a worthy sequal with the same charm and tone of that first film and this film, while it tries, misses. The plot moves a bit slowly and the underwater sequences, at least on my home theatre, are very dark and murky (perhaps it's the print as the trailer actually looks better than the film). Robert Ryan as Nemo doesn't do much in the role. Chuck Conners is wooden but it seems as though the role was written that way. Overall it could have been much better but it isn't bad unless you compare this film to it's predecessor."
1,Academic Fustian,"This is a disappointing book. The author contrives to make the amazing, dramatic events of Heraclius' reign banal, even boring. No doubt the source material is sparse and unreliable and this is some excuse. Regretably there is no serious attempt to assess the military resources and tactics of the participants in the struggle; the Avars come on to the scene and depart from it undescribed. The question of how Heraclius managed to maintain his army so long in the formidable mountains of Eastern Anatolia is not adequately addressed.The reign of Heraclius is very important; its consequences reverberate down to the present day, but unfortunately it still awaits treatment in extenso by a scholar who is endowed not only with diligence but with literary talent as well."
5,Great Digital Camera,I've had this camera just a couple months and I've got to say that this is the best camera I've ever owned. I'm still exploring all the various modes and setups but even with just the auto mode the pictures come out just great. The depth of field with this camera is absolutely amazing and the image stabilization is wonderful. I would never buy another digital camera without this feature especially with a powerful zoom like this one.I would highly recommend this camera to those who are looking for a step up over regular point and shoot cameras but don't want to go all the way into a bulky and more expensive single lens reflex. This camera has the pro features you want at a reasonable price.
1,stopped working after 2 weeks!,"I'll admit, the first two weeks I used this camera it was great. However, I never really had the chance to find out for sure b/c after two weeks my camera stopped working. It shut down during use and wouldn't turn back on. I sent the camera back to Canon Factory, hoping it would be fixed or for a replacement, however, I was told that it was unrepairable and I was SOL - basically. Reason? corrosion. From what? - Canon wouldn't say. How is this possible after two weeks and only 3 uses?!?!?!?! So i'm out $500 and I'll be sure never to buy another Canon product. I feel I've been had by the Canon people. After reading reviews/complaints I found that this was a common problem among Canon products. Advice for consumers - keep your camera in bubble wrap and don't use it. This way it will last at least a few months. Good luck!"
3,new camera,"I recieved my package in a timely manner with all of the accessories and the box. The camera seems to stall when I take pictures sometimes though. That can be extremely frustrating when trying to take photos of a 2 year old or any animals. Hoping this is just my inept skills at photography and not the actual camera. Other than that, I am happy with my purchase. Not a usual online buyer. Amazon and the provider of my camera made it very easy."
5,Wonderful camera!,"All I can say is about this camera is it is really great and I HIGHLY suggest this camera to anyone with an interest in good photography. The manual settings are a must for anyone into birding/botany/nature. Everything is awesome about this product, although consider buying a tripod, bag, 1GB+ SD memory card, and maybe some optics, although the optics aren't really needed to get really, really great images with this camera. If you want a video camera and a camera, consider buying this all-in-one camera/video, because the movie mode is perfect and works great for anything. I've even used it in documenting a severe storm in our area; recording hail, wind, and flood damage. Can't beat it in any area!"
4,Good Camera,"I think it is an overall good camera. I am pretty new at the more advanced options. The manual is kind of vague. I upgraded from a kodak CX series, so getting used to the setup was my initial challenge, but once you learn what everything does, it becomes fairly simply to operate. Trial and Error worked the best for me. The zoom works wonderfully-with the image stablization. I would say it is worth the money."
4,a professional attempt for amateurs,Canon S3 is the latest camera for S series. Nothing has changed much though. The black color makes you feel comfortable about your camera. It will not be wrong to say that S3= Black S2 with 6 megapixel.
5,Finally,"I have owned 2 Sony Cybershot Cameras, a Pentax Optio, a HP ??. I used to do a lot of SLR film photography and have never been satisfied with the switch to digital until now. Very happy with ease of use and QUALITY of pictures."
3,A simple and Quick Review,"I am NOT not a newcomer to digital cameras or 35mm either.I have gotten some really nice shots with this camera. Those were achieved when I had a little time to fine-tune all my settings. If you just use auto mode, you will NOT be pleased (if you know a good pic when you see it).I have 3 kids so the fact that I have to fiddle with it before I can snap a picture is a BIG no-no in my book. I have to be quick around here! That was one star gone.The other star gone is the noise issue. It does NOT matter what settings I use, there is always some sort of noise. Granted, if you run it through an editing program, it's okay..... BUT I don't want to HAVE to edit ALL of my pics.I haven't replaced it yet... so I guess I'm dealing with it. I'll just keep my eyes open for the ""perfect"" camera."
3,Not so great,"I had a Panasonic FZ-30 that got wet. After it got wet, it no longer worked. Although I was very happy with it, it was no longer in production, and the FZ-50 which replaced it was $150 more than the Canon S3, so I ended up buying the Canon.That was a mistake. The Panasonics image quality is much better. The S3's pictures are grainy and never got that level of crispness I got with the Panasonic. It is also very light and does not have the quality feel of the panasonic.I tried to save $150 and it didn't work. I am going to go ahead and buy the FZ-50."
3,Slave flash for S3 IS - Question,"I have a Canon Speedlite 200E. Can this be used as a slave flash for the S3 IS?If not, can anyone recommend a good flash?"
5,Great book & great sellers,"This book was stated that it was used, but in good condition. The sellers were right, the book was in excellent condition and looked brand new. Shipped pretty fast. I would definately buy from them again. This book was worth it and was definately what I was looking for. The quizzes after each chapter is very helpful and there's even a section with definitions, which is nice to have. Great book for beginners in CT!"
2,Book is outdated,I am currently studying for the CT registry. I purchased this book and began reading it. The chapter on the physics and the CT contrast just did not seem right. The allergies and the contraindications for contrast seemed really outdated and the physics and design of the machine did not match the machine that I use. I flipped open the front of the book and the copyright date is 2000. Well in the world of CT that is light years from the present day. Some of the material is ok but for the most part the book is outdated and I did not trust the information in it to be accurate. I will put it in the recycle pile and use the other book that I bought. What a disappointment. Bushong is a great source but needs to update this book.
3,Its OK...nothing special,"Its basically OK.Its fast enough but since it comes with Windows CE 2.2 (outdated) and only a small memory and expansion slot, its not comparable to the big names in hand-held technology.I think Phillips abandoned it too early and i'm not sure how to get support, but with a modem and wireless phone, this could be used by average businessman to send and receive e-mail.It has a neat organizer and NoteTaker, Calendar and really well done handwriting program which is precise and quick. The lack of support and small memory and expansion card that's incompatible with today's flash cards, makes this product only marginally useful. For the price maybe not so great. ......"
1,Windows CE brings it down,"I love the style and visual appeal of this device, but the Windows CE interface is so clumsy on this little cutie. I really wish they had gone to another vendor, rather than supporting Microsoft in their efforts to dominate. Basically, since CE is sooo bad, Nino is bad too. I cant stand that start button! Way to much clicking and pointing for such a small device. Sorry Phillips! But you did real good on TiVo!"
2,Sorry - it does not deliver,"When you look at the specifications for the Nino, it looks extremely cool. Colour, large memory, Windows CE. But after working with it for a month, I am seriously considering dumping it. Its actually quite large, it is slow, and as Win CE is a memory hog 8MB is really not a lot. I'll give it two stars for the screen. It is certainly better than the Aeros. But it seems like the idea behing Nino and Win CE is to cram all the functionality of a notebook into a palm-sized device. It is bound to fail, and it certainly does so in this case. Perhaps I'll give it a shot if they ever do a new and smaller version of CE. In the meantime, I'm putting my old Palm Pilot Pro back to work."
4,My Nino now controls my life,"I've found the Nino an excellent organizational tool. No more carrying around a big paper planner. No more transferring tasks manually day after day. It's all done automatically. I've not missed or been late for a meeting since buying mine.I did have a problem with the rechargeable battery that came with the unit. That's the only problem so far. While the Nino is a bit larger than the Palm V, I find it has better features (battery life, memory, etc.)."
4,"Price A+, Features A+, Size B-, Ease of Use A-, Modem A+",Bought this unit and just started using it. Synchro is awesome with my computer...and it includes a modem... I couldn't find any other Palms with a modem for under $400. The writing recognition is good.... I am happy with this unit and would recommend this Philips product. Shop around...8MB and a modem beats the heck out of everything else I saw.
1,Died :-(,I bought this as a replacement for my fathers monitor. Two years of light use and then it died. Even at this price its not really worth taking up the space on your desktop. You can find thin screens for about $120. They take up half the space and most seem to last. I wouldn't touch it used.
3,Good but,"The book is well written, however some chapters are avaliable on CD only with no print permission. I do not like reading books on my computer screen. If you don't like ebooks like me find another book"
1,Just a rehash of the D4 book,"The problems with this book are many. First and foremost, it's mostly just a rehash of the D4 book of the same title. I bought the book looking for all the nifty new stuff in D5 to be covered and was sorely disappointed. Where's the IE wrapper component? Where are the new COM servers? This is obviously just a minimal update of the D4 book. Second, this book is physically too large. I'm not impressed by 1500p book that's half-filled with screen shots, chapter summaries and the like. This book resulted in enough trees deaths to deserve a GreenPeace alert. C'mon, is all this really necessary?Bottom line: if you have the D4 book, you already have this one. Save your money."
2,Not overly impressed,"I enjoyed the creepiness of it and must admit there were times I actually felt my heart pounding a bit...and I was jumpy around the house for a little while...but it still can't be classified as ""horror"", it isn't really satisfying as a mystery, it's more than just a story. I guess, for me, it just left a whole lot to be desired.The main characters were very one-dimensional. In fact, ALL of the characters were one-dimensional and needed a lot of development.I can't say I'd never read another Pyper book again but I can say I'm not rushing out to see if there are any more."
2,What O'Henry ending?,"Sorry, folks, didn't find any O""Henry ending at the close of this book. In fact, not quite sure what the ending is. I kept expecting something more. What happened to the teacher? What was the point of the final hiding the shirt near a school playground? What was the narrator's turn of events? Nice description of events in a small northern Canada town, but as for plot, very disappointing."
5,Taste soooo good!,"Classic French mints made from mineral water of the spa town Vichy. I think there was a queen of either France or England who once declared these as her favorite sweets. They come not individually wrapped, but all in one bag. They are white, chalky and standard size for hard candy. They are so addicting and so good. Has a more subtle mint taste. More sweet like candy than an American mint. More like a dessert than a breath-freshener. I love them."
4,Bodyguard,"Dr. Paige Harrington spent almost all of her life preparing to be a specialized trauma surgeon. She didn't have much of a childhood, as she graduated from high school still a child not having anything in common with her peers. Now that she has the life she wants, she is ready to live. For her that includes dates, boyfriends, and sex.Detective Nick Santorelli is in the doghouse at work, and in order to redeem himself, has agreed to take an assignment beneath him. He will be babysitting a doctor that witnessed a horrific murder. She has seen the killers face, and the killer never leaves anyone behind that can identify him.They find themselves drawn to each other, and Nick takes it upon himself to teach Paige everything she wants to know. The chemistry is well written, and the characters have multiple layers. Nick and Paige are hot together!! My only criticism is that this is a short book. There were passages that felt very rushed."
4,So fun! Great for Science Project...,"Would have given it 5 stars but we've had a difficult time getting old peices of food out of the bottom. They are turning moldy after two weeks. Hope it's not a bother to the ants... kind of gross to look at!Still, it's an educational toy and a great way to bring the outdoors in :)"
5,So Much Fun!,"We saw some reviews that were not positive but we really enjoyed this ant hill. Almost all of the ants arrived alive and are still going strong in their sixth week. My eight year old loved watching them tunnel. Every day he was ""wowed"" by how much they had accomplished. Would definitely recommend."
3,DISNEY PRINCESS CHILD VALUE PACK HAS ELBOW PADS MISSING WHEN RECEIVED,"THIS ITEM ONLY CONTAINS ONE PAIR OF KNEE PADS. NO ELBOW PADS AS THE PICTURE SHOWS. I DON'T KNOW WHO I WRITE TO ABOUT THIS, AS I THREW AWAY THE OUTER PACKAGE IN WHICH THEY WERE MAILED TO ME. I HAD THEM WRAPPED FOR CHRISTMAS AND DIDN'T REALIZE SOMETHING WAS MISSING. SO PLEASE TAKE NOTE OF THIS WHEN PURCHASING THIS PRODUCT. OTHER THAN THAT, THIS PRODUCT IS VERY NICE AND USEFUL."
4,Very cool,"Of the set, this is my favorite CD. But be aware this music is not for everyone. If you like crazy surf music complete with drag racing sound effects, barking dogs, and crazed killer laughs then stop here and push the ""Add to cart"" button! The sound quality is nothing short of fantastic. Even though it is in Mono, it is the best sounding compilation CD I've ever heard. If you never heard anything other than the Surfaris or the Ventures, you should lay down cash for this."
3,rockin' the mic in an elevator,"If you're like me, then you'll agree this song written for the film, ""An Ordinary Life"" was the best part of said...film. It didn't get too much play on the radios here (most of the time is now devoted to running ""busy child"" ad naseum)and as for buying the whole soundtrack, there was no reason as it was another alterna-compilation of already issued singles pandering to white males age 18-25. Also, the diverse Mr. Hansen provides your $ worth for the single with a bevy of 2 (count 'em, two)b-sides! always the best part of bringing a single on home."
2,Missing so much..,"It's not just the eight seconds that are missing here..it's the great postgame interviews that James Brown got and the excellent pregame show, the inital version of ""One Shining Moment"". I got it all on VHS 20 years ago and I really wanted to see those parts again. Great game, poor DVD."
1,Not that great,"Ok, this book does go through how to draw (some!) dragon ball z characters. It has all the characters that are on the cover plus i think android 18, it only has them each with one expession and one position. You can look at any dragon ball z manga and easily have a thousand more (good) drawings to practice with. You don't need all the so-called 'instructions' for drawing dragon ball z as it all becomes clear after drawing only a couple different pictures of the same characters. This book is a waste of time and money, buy it if you want to see for yourself it's not that expensive but take my word... it's not worth it."
2,Pure Baloney,"Good entertaining Science fiction from BYU. For those who think every thing is a conspiracy, it must be a treat. The notion that this was a plot to get the public open to the invasion of the middle east is PURE BALONEY. NOVA provides a much more lucid and plausible cause. The structure was simply unable to sustain the enormous weight of the disintegrated upper portion given the way it was constructed. AND--imagine the number of people who would have been involved with this ""PLOT"". And imagine (it takes quite an imagination), everyone remaining silent! BYU is that Brigham Young University, the place that believes in make believe golden tablets and the Americanized Jesus?"
1,CHEAP,I got this with the cd player and they broke after two weeks. They just aren't durable. Make an investment and buy good headphones that don't break.
1,Don't waste your money,"The sound quality is extremely poor. I was very disappointed. I've got better sound from no-name over the counter headphones (yes, for even less money).Aiwa has better headphones (Amazon doesn't have a FULL selection), so shop around."
3,You Get What You Pay For,"Comfortable and nice looking, but the sound quality is pretty low. Very little bass plays through the speakers. However, the sound quality is probably worth the price."
4,Ultimate in Record Keeping,"I have recently used these third edition character sheets. They offer spaces to record all of your information, and are very copier friendly. Also, there is enough room on them to record all your gold, silver, jewelry, gems, weapons, etc. etc. etc. I reccommend this to anyone planning on playing Third Edition Dungeons and Dragons."
5,Wizards got the Sheets Right,"The character sheets for Dungeons & Dragons 3rd Edition are a boon to those of us who enjoy having neat, pre-printed forms to record our glorious adventures. And the best part is, you are free to photocopy them (for personal use).The sheets are beautifully laid-out, one for each character class, a generic one for non-standard or dual-class characters, a form for companions, and checklists of spells available to each class.No more hard-to-read sheets on filler paper, and no more fearing that Wizards of the Coast/TSR will be beating down your door because you took the sheets to Kinko's to have them copied."
5,Read this book!,I remember this book from my teenage years. I have always wanted to reread it but it was expensive. When I was given a kindle gift certificate it was my chance to buy the kindle edition. It was so worth the price! What a wonderful adventure and a great way to revisit the characters of this book. Someone described it at Lonesome Dove meets Huckleberry Finn. Perfect.
5,A timeless evocation of pioneering in the old west,"I can only echo the comments of your other reviewers. The plot, characterisations and dialogue epitomise all that makes the ""western"" such an enduring genre. Not only am I astounded that this fine book should be out of print, I am also amazed that it hasn't been filmed. Clint as Coulter?"
3,Humorous but sometimes tedious...,"I liked the general plot behind this book - I love history and I love the Gold Rush period. And while I enjoyed quite a few of Jaimie and co.'s adventures, sometimes I found the book a little gruesome (some of the Indian segments), or just dull (the extended Mormon sequences). However, I do think Taylor writes with a lot of tongue-in-cheek humor, and for that, I'd probably up it to 3 1/2 stars."
4,"Portland, Oregon in the 21st Century","These guys are one of the best examples of the new-age hillbilly scene in Portland, Oregon. Their shows are full of terrific musicianship mixed with humor and great vocals. The album is a great way to get familiar with these guys as you wait for the next show.Featuring members of ""Golden Delicious"" and ""Holy Modal Rounders"""
3,Does not support VOX,"I should have realized that this mic does not support VOX. I guess when you buy a microphone its can be either PTT (push to talk) or VOX.I'll have to return this and get a VOX enabled one, though I'm not sure which one at this point."
2,Disappointing,"The microphone and earbud itself are not bad, but, I was expecting to get a set of 2. The picture shows 2 sets, yet only 1 shipped. I think the seller is misleading by showing 2 headsets in the pic, but only shipping 1. I did read over the description and it never said there were 2. None-the-less, if I would have gotten 2 as the picture shows, it would be a good deal and a 5 star rating. 2 stars given for only getting 1 set, and it being overpriced for the quality of just the 1."
2,Not for all day wear,"I (like many others) use the radios when riding my snowboard.The sound quality can't be faulted, both sending and receiving are crystal clear (and now private). Wearing it all day you can now hear when people are paging you, not just when standing in line.Now the bad; the build quality should be questioned, the speaker inside the earbod rattles around in mine, and the ""PTT"" button is difficult to press when wearing gloves. The earbud's a little big for my ear, and isn't as comfortable as it could be (although it fits under my helmet fine).The other problem I've had with this is that it pops out of the headphone jack on the radio with annoying regularity. I've solved this with duct tape, which isn't pretty but it is functional...."
2,not worth the money,"I purchased many of these, they are great for a short period of time and it seems as the warranty wears out they stop working, u can talk but cannot hear anyone else. Pay more to get a more sturdy item."
1,Boom microphone didn't work,"The headset is a bit bulky. Not very comfortable to wear. I could hear the other person talking to me very clearly. However, when I spoke, he could not hear me at all. The boom microphone was not working from the first use. Would not recommend you purchase this."
3,ok item,it iss ok because it has an exeptional construction but is not verry loud i got this item for skate zone 71 but they hated it
4,Motorola 53725 SLK headset/w swivel boom mic,The head set worked well for hunting. It has a slight delay when you first start talking that you need to get used to. Also it pics up coughing and other noises that sometime you don't want out over the air.Ed W
5,Very funny!,"Very funny travel log. It reads like an extended email from a friend writing about his travel. Mr. Olmstead also finds a way to weave in stories from his childhood. It comes off as a friendly extended travel note.The humorous and self deprecating nature of this travel writing is very much in the tradition of Tony Hawke. You'll find yourself alternating between laughing out loud and screaming, ""Doh!""I am thankful that I'm not a friend of his. :-) I'd hate for him to dog on me like he reams on his buddies!"
5,"GALS, HERE'S YOUR CHANCE TO FIND OUT WHAT GUYS ARE THINKING!","Here is a book that captures, with humor, the travels of two young American single men, searching for exotic adventures and new experiences in a foreign land. By the flip of a coin, the two headed off to Asia with exuberance and enthusiasm. Jon Olmstead leads the reader across Asia from one exciting and hysterical event after another, as well as back home with his flashbacks of delightful and sometimes comical ""growing up"" happenings and mishaps. A great book for the guys to relive some of their own similar ""events"" and a fantastic book for the gals who are curious about the most personal thoughts of young gents - on American soil or while traveling and fancy free!! Highly entertaining and light, easy reading that is sure to make you yearn for more!"
4,great value,"great basic string of pearls, wonderful price.The pearls have a strong greenish-blue cast, which is pretty."
3,Not bad,"In response...the purpose of learning that Nona's joy can not be depleated is important bacause for Darius to work magic, he must use the joy from another woman. He must disgard a woman every year to work magic, and that woman is completly depleated of all joy. Her joy may come back in a small amount over years. Since Nona's joy can't be depleated, it enables him to work magic without draining a woman."
1,Beautiful piece but awful build,"I finally got around to using this last night and it is going back.This is a beautiful looking piece and if all I was going to do was to put it on display, I would definitely keep it but I need something that actually works.The glass that comes with the set is tiny. The build of the warmer will not allow of any other sized glass.When you light the votive which comes with the set, the flame actually touches the glass and soots and heats the cognac way too quickly.Awful, awful, awful.Will try my luck with the following:http://www.amazon.com/Brandy-Warmer-4-Piece-Gift-Set/dp/B0000AUZKC/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid;=1345838542&sr;=8-1&keywords;=cognac+warmer"
4,Grrreat live band!,I had never heard of this group before. But i just went to a concert by AIR and Mosquitos were opening for them. VERY good group. Left an impression on me. The Lead singer is a short spunky gal with lots of energy. Pick this up!
4,Bosa Nova for the New Millenium,"This novel, fun, and disturbingly catchy collection of Brazialian pop melodies supports very American lyrics that are clever and coy. It's the type of recording Steely Dan would have made had they spent their college days in Rio. It has a waft of one-hit wonder to it, but I have a feeling I'll be playing this one on road trips for a long way to come."
3,Snow Takes Patience,"I don't know what I expected but I think I expected a little more than I got. To be clear, the machine does make nice fluffy snow out of ice cubes and, when used with syrups makes a very nice summer treat. But, you have to be patient, you have to have a little muscle, and ear plugs might be nice as it creates quite a few decibels transforming hardened cubes into snow. It's probably worth $20 (although I paid $29.99 for it at Target...should've researched first.)"
4,"GREAT FOR SHAVED, FLUFFY ICE IN A HURRY!","As a whole, I love this ice shredder. It includes 2 ice cups for freezing ice and also for using when shredding ice. I tried this with several ice cubes and it did ok, but better when using one of the frozen ice cups. Overall, I like this product, however, it is bulky and did not do as well when using regular ice cubes. If it had not been for that, I would have given this product a 5."
4,"Fluffy Ice, but LOUD","I tried a few ice shavers and for the money, this works well if you use the round flat ice mould it comes with. I couldn't get it to work with my ice machine ice spears.It's so loud that I use it in the garage.However, I really like the fluffy, flaky ice it makes."
2,"Seducing, but misguided","This book seduces the parent into believing that he can (and should) teach his or her child to read at an unhealthy early age. The flashcards did nothing for my child and later I found that many children who learn to read this way, suffer from problems in the future with language. Plus, many children who excel in the way these people encourage don't fit in with other children (I've seen this firsthand). The authors only use their own studies, which is dangerously one-sided. The Successful Homeschool Handbook by Moore was a much better example of teaching kids ""naturally"" at home. Let the babies learn more important things, like the world around them, and you'll have a more well-rounded child."
5,Used with two fo 5 children,"In 1974-75 I was the mother of four plus a Vietnamese teenager who spoke no English. I used this method on my toddler Melody and my baby Edgar. Lots of people made fun of me, but I continued since they seemed to be enjoying it. As I continued with the program I discovered that Bic was learning to speak and read English right along with my little ones. Soon I had everything in the house labeled. It was quite a sight. I was working and was not able to do the program with our fifth child. Melody and Edgar (both middle children)are avid readers who read quite rapidly and have quite a love for it. You almost never see them without a book and they both have highly sucessful careers. My other three children all like reading, but nothing like the two who went through this program. Edgar now has a 6 month old baby and I would love to see her use the same program her daddy did."
2,"interesting subject, trying writing","There is no doubt Buddy Cianci is an interesting figure worth reading about. However, this book seems at many times to be not much more than the rehashing of newspaper articles written by the writer or his colleagues. All the chapters have snappy introductions, or ""ledes,"" as journalists say, and tend thereafter to be very repetitive in their descriptions of the mayor.I did not mind purchasing the book, as Cianci is an interesting figure to know about, but I found myself skimming over sentences and sections much more often than I like. Not recommended."
2,buddy...you can't change the spots on a leopard!!!,all i read about & hear is all he has done for providence. people forget that he is two for two with his administrations. corruption times two. he is no different that a common petty thief. all he did for providence was give it two black eye's. he turned Porvidence into the chicago of the east.
3,Problem Solver,Belkkin S video to RCA adapter.....If you are ever in a jam where using pre run SVHS cables is the only solution and the TV or other device has no svhs input the Belkin adapter is the MacGiver answer . It lets you use RCA video inputs while still using exsting S video cables...great cost saver...Sparky
4,Very Good Product,This elbow support is great. It has helped lots. The price is much better than competitors. I wear if every day for about 4-hours and to bowling. I recommend it.
1,If you like wet pants or shorts,"I bought two of these, one leaked so i returned it and got a new one, now they both leak and my window to return has lapsed. When i say leaked, i dont mean the pouch that holds water, the mouth piece continually drips water and most likely will drip water onto your clothes, so unless its raining, its very annoying and if it doesnt drip on your clothes, its dripping the water you hope to drink in the near future. Don't buy this water pack if you really want a water pack, go with the Camelbak brand, that is what I have now and it was worth the money."
4,"Bite leaks a little, but a good pack overall","Your biteguard (drinky-part) will leak for a few moments after taking a sip, but it's not that big of a deal. A decent pack that will keep you hydrated on your trips. Does not taste ""plastic-y"" or funky either, which is nice."
5,Great concept,"I really enjoyed the sound created by the fusion of various music genres. On one hand, there are the ""hot"" bluesy riffs in ""Long Hot Day"" (which is a great tune to CRANK UP during the summer rush-hour drive home). On the other hand, one can relax and enjoy the laid back sounds of ""Turn my Way"" or ""Forever in Your Eyes""--also complete with tasty little guitar licks laced throughout. Add in Mr. Boyle's smooth voice and some catchy lyrics, and you have a combination guaranteed to satisfy."
4,Not at his best,"Rule can do so much better than this!!! He is a good mc but he hasnt reached his potential. Venni vetti vecci was a quality album, there were no bad tracks. As the albums go on they get worse. Now we get to a point where we know what he is capable of but he just churns out la di da songs. He opens with a statement saying he doesnt need to prove himself, then he tries to diss DMX in a later song. He said he wouldnt bark back at Xs remarks!!! we dont need another pac and big incident.Where was the change? was it when he teamed up with Nas and the row et al?On the whole it has got some great tracks but he has got too many fillers. The album did only take 12days to record, maybe a little time needed"
1,Please hand over the Mic Ja!!,"Ok look for all Ja fans. go buy his album. You bunch of brainwashed, spongeheads just soaking up every bit of Carson and his Wack reviews. Good for you Ja fans. Look he has a couple of Hot tracks on this album 2 or 3 but he never has a good album. Hey look the guy drops some Hot singles that we all pump in our rides from time to time. But come on. Now everyone is jockin Pac to help record sales. Damn there is only 1 Tupac and he is R.I.P. please leave the man alone. Oh yea one other thing If you like Tupac Biters go and cop Jay-Z's album also. Thats another good album for you Spongeheads. For all you True Heads, Cop The Better Dayz album. Tupac Still lives through every words he spits on his tracks. One."
1,Ja Rule: KNOCK DOWN IN ROUND FOUR!!!,"Round #4. Ja Rule is knocked down instantly. Every album he's dropped since his debut (Venni Vetti Vecci) has always fell off one notch below the one before. ""Venni Vetti Vecci"" is incomparable, ""Rule:3:36"" was great, ""Pain is Love"" was FAIR, but the latest album ""The Last Temptation,"" is poor and fails in it's entirety. Perhaps some of the tracks off ""TLT,"" are what were left over from ""Pain is Love."" Ja Rule is down for the count. Will he ever get up?"
1,..........,"aight i gotta say this.ja clames himself pac but on this album i got 2 say dis,pac was never pop and didnt sing on tracks period.theres bout 1 good song on here and dats da pledge cus it only has nas in da first verse.....so my last word is...ja is pop music never was true rap..dats all i got 2 say"
2,The only person mildly good was Charli Baltimore,"Jay-Z Jay-Z, I know he was good at first, but now, look what you created, I just don't know about Rule anymore, I bought this album hoping he would return to his Thug roots, but this can't even stand up to a Jump5 album. If he wants to save his career, he better apologize to Eminem, go back to REAL hip-hop roots, and beg the rap industry to give him one more chance. As for Charli, never rap with him again and I'm looking forward to your solo album."
1,whackstreet boys are better then this filth,Apparently Ja Rule is rap but this album is cat litter material. He sings way more then he raps and when he does he portrays so little talent it is sickening. If anyone bought this album go return it as soon as possible. Or throw it away.
1,Pop Music at it's Best!,"This is ridiculos, i hope this isnt classed as Rap, i admit i am a hater of Ja Rule and ""The Inc"" but come on, this is really bad and he is singing!? omg now come on, i dont mind if people buy his music, they can like it if they want no problem, but my opinion is that this is awful and i would recommend this only to people into Pop Music like Backstreet Boys and Spice Girls and Nsync and Nelly.1 out of 5, that 1 vote deserves to be here? nah but ey gotta give him sum credit for his work...(...)"
3,Ja Rule avoids retirement to attempt a return to the streets,"Jeffery ""Ja Rule"" Atkins' latest album,The Last Temptation,is Ja's attempt to earn his street cred back and return to his birthplace. Well, Ja didnt even seem to try considering the 12 days it took him to record it. This album is slightly harder than Pain is Love but is on the same platform.He didnt include his DMX bite-back track on the album saving it for mixtapes.So listen carefully for the much-anticipated DMX/50 Cent diss on ""Connected"",and hear his only complete thug track on the Neptune's produced ""Pop [Niggas]"".Aside from that we'll need another try from the Hollis,Queens native for yet another try to reach the emcee level simply known as ""Pac"".3 out of 5 stars."
2,What Happened?,"What happened to you JaRule. You used to be the s**t. When his frist album dropped he was off the hook. 3 albums later he is just all together whack. Hes not even a rapper anymore, he is just a singer. If you want a good cd get Blueprint 2 and leave this whack as* s**t in the store."
3,it's okay,the songs are kind of original and some of them got some crazy beats.ja spits some tight rhymes.consider buying this cd or at least copy to your mp3 player some of the best songs lika the pledge remix and mesmerize with ashanti .peace ya
1,He's kidding right,"Tell me he's kidding with this CD. This was probably the biggest bust of the year and I'm mad I listened to this garbage. He has gone from DMX to Tupac to Maxwell. Whoever told him he could sing should be fired. This album has no business in rap. Picture R Kelly singing about shooting people. He is a joke, no wonder so many people in rap can't stand this guy. I will however use this CD as a frisbee, it's got a nice flight to it when you throw it."
1,"played out pop, again","more and more of this played out pop/rap keeps coming. with artists like Ja Rule and Nelly, it is expanded more and more. we had enough pop/rap in 2002 with Nelly's ""NELLVILLE"" record, we didn't need ja rule to add even more of it to the year. the 1st single, ""Thug Lovin'"" is a typical pop record with the suprising guest appearence of Bobby Brown. ""Mezmorize"" with Ashanti is again a typical pop/rap single. ""The Pledge-REMIX"" isn't as pop and is a better track considering it features Nas & 2Pac, but still, Lsst Temptation is a pop record. i don't like pop records. if it was up to me i would give this album 0 stars, but, for the sake of singles like ""the pledge-REMIX"" and ""murder reigns"", i will give it a weak 1 star vote. if you want good RAP music, check out early 2Pac and Biggie albums, maybe early Nas and Mobb Deep, something better than Ja rule and his pop/rap empire."
2,JA-RULE: The Last Temptation or The Last Effort?,"... This is supposed to be a hip-hop album, not a soul/r&b album. Ja just lost his touch after his debut album; now he just gets his perks from making whack song after whack song ...truely a dissapointing effort."
2,DISSAPOINTING!!!!!!,"the only reason i gave it 2 stars because i liked ""Rock Star"" and ""Mesmerized"" all the other songs r garbage!!! WHERE IS THE JARULE WE SAW IN ""VENNI VETTI VECCI""???????? ""pain is love"" and ""venni vetti vecci"" waz great but this iz just like ""3:16"": A DISGRACE TO THE NAME HIP HOP.PS - and he wonders why his album sales are low this year!"
1,"""What Happened To That Boy?""","""J Put You On, X Made you hot.""-50 CENT""Ja Rule is one of the worst things to happen to Hip Hop since Vanilla Ice. He is one of the worst Hip Hoppers ever and needs to go sit down somewhere. His pop music has once again swayed masses of teenagers to the record store to buy his trash. He is garbage. He cant rap. He cant sing. He has gotten away with it by inhaling the ashes of Tupac Shakur. People flock to him hoping to see Pac. If Pac were alive, he would tear Ja a new one. Its garbage."
1,horrible,"Words can't describe how horrible this album is. I bought it thinking it would be like one of Pac's CD's, but I was wrong. Ja does not even come close. Don't get me wrong, I liked Ja's first CD, but that's about it. The only good song on here is the Pledge with Nas. One song out of an entire album? Save yor money for Nas's Godson or the Snoop album."
2,WANKSTA,"I wish people would stop calling Ja Rule a wannabe Tupac because that is an insult to Tupac. Their names shouldn't even be mentioned in the same sentence. What happened to Ja? He's fallen a long way since ""Holla Holla."" Every single he releases now is a collaboration with some female singing about relationships. Does Ja think his fan base is stupid? Does he think no one will notice that he is just remanufacturing the same song over and over. Ja should just release an R&B album where he is singing on every track because you know that's all he wants to do. You can put Ja Rule in the same category as LL: former hard rappers who lost their street cred by trying to pass pop records off as hip-hop. ..."
3,"Nobody will ever be Pac, period.","I bought Ja Rule's first album when my friend told me not to is because that I think he got potential. He proves himself and others that he is a hits maker with his next two album. His style of singing and mix of pop and hip-hop bring him a great deal of success, but his ego is also getting out of control. This album is more or less the same as the last album, with more pop mix song like ""Mesmerize"" feat Ashinti. Although most of his songs donesn't have much meaning other than sex and ""Murda"" references, the beats are never the less still good. But his foolish attempt of trying to be 2pac makes me laugh. Creating beef with DMX (duplicate Pac and Bigge), work with Pac's old lable, ""Death Row"" (Tha Row) are all childish attempts to be 2pac. Face it Ja Rule, you are not 2pac, you never was, never is, and never will be, so don't call youself Pac on the radio. Wake up !!"
4,It's Murda...STILL!!,"k this isnt as good an album as his earlier ones, but hey! get over it, its good! my favorite songs are pop n****s-great music and rapping; murder reigns-a little like rainy dayz; last temptation-i love the beats on this track!! awesome! charli's got talent, shes a good addition to murder inc; the warning-brings back some venni vetti vecci memories in the last verse, but shouldnt mention destiny's child; emerica-haha great song about politics...united ghettos of emerica...what the world's like today i guess...; and rock star-hey, if ya dont like ja its okay is the message there! you should listen to it...ok now for some of the other reviewers: all those rock fans out there, if you dont like hip hop, why the hell are you reviewing it?! and for whoever it was that said 2pac and biggie were FAKE THUGS what ... are you ON?! they were...oh god they were the masters!! esp. 2pac!! RIPif ya like ja, get the album-its worth it! and haters can keep hatin, it dont matter. peace out yall"
2,berimbau,"This instrument arrived as a perfectly straight piece of wood. The berimbau is supposed to be curved so that there is room for the string to vibrate. Although the explanation included in the box was that the instrument should not be bent for shipping, I assure you this piece of wood is much too strong to be worried about breaking. The manufacturer should put the bend in before shipping."
2,lenmar battery,The new battery dimension was slightly larger than the original equipment battery which was also a lenmar nickel metal-hydride camcorder battery and has to be forced into the charger because of tight clearances. The battery did not last long after the first complete charge.
5,An ***honest*** Honest review,"Probably the best soundtrack CD since the genius that was Notting Hill. Captures all of the aspects of the movie with every other track being actual dialogue from the stars themselves. Excellent CD to chill out to whether you have seen the film or not. The movie itself stars three of the superb vocal talents that are the All Saints: Melanie Blatt and the Appleton sisters Nicole and Natalie who contribute as bonus tracks on the end of the soundtrack. Lead singer Melanie Blatt sings My Cherie Amour, Natalie Appleton duets with the superb Bootsy Collins to create an excellent cover of You're All I Need To Get By , and Nicole Appleton's cover of Reflections, originaly by Diana Ross and The Supremes which also appears on the album is a brave choice seen as though it is such a classic is covered surprisingly well. An excellent soundtrack to add to any CD collection."
5,"Once Again, A Standard of Excellence...","This collection, just as each and every other album of Ray Price, stands to serve as reminder of what the benchmark of ""REAL DANCEHALL MUSIC"" is all about. It's incredible shuffle beats and hauntingly sad lyrics will provide memories that will last throughout time immemorial."
1,DO NOT BUY!,"I purcahsed this cover for my 2012 white Ducati Monster 696. The cover fit nicely, however after 1 day in the sun I removed the cover to find that it had discolored my white gas tank. There are now fabric looking blotches of piss YELLOW on my WHITE gas tank and rear faring. I tried to return return this product only to find out that I have to pay for the return shipping, which is half of the product price. This only gets one star because I have to put one star. I would like a full refund including shipping and handling."
3,"Good selection of Playmates, but too much ""behind the scenes","Playmates Tawni Cable, Petra Verkaik, Julie Clarke, Christina Leardini and others on shoots in Hawaii and other exotic locations. Best segment is Julie sunbathing topless on the beach."
3,Who is this for?????,"Kudos to Osprey, first of all, for publishing this line of books. BUT...I question the choice of author on this one. I have purchased other books in this series, for example the F-4 Phantom II book, and have been fairly pleased. This one, though, is a book without a specific market. It's not for the newbie (that's for sure!!) although the pictures @ first glance would make you think it is. The author walks you through the process, but mentions things I've never heard of...often in passing or in a single sentence. I've been modeling for 10 years, and am befuddled by his references...and not just because some products aren't sold here in the states. Think about it: if I knew these advanced procedures and obscure products you mention in your book, why in the heck would I buy your book???!!!I rate the title 3 stars because they do cover a variety of scales & brands, and the printing, & pictures are very good."
5,Good motor,"I bought this motor from this seller. Shipping was prompt and the motor was easy to install. I needed to reverse the polarity to get it to turn the other direction for my furnace, but the motor was designed to do so. I am pleased for the first night of operation. Let's see how it does in the long run. I would think it will do well."
4,Works like it was meant to,Does the job. I use it when playing volleyball and it's good protection for the knees.
2,too loose on the upper side,I returned this product because it was not very tight in the upper part and was like going down when I bend my knee!
4,Nice Pads,Ideal knee pads for practice. Not to bulky foam and good craftsmanship. Knee coverage is just too long which affects comfort.
5,Great product!,These are the 3rd pair of Mizuno knee pads I buy for my boys (they've grown out of the old ones) are they love them.They protect their knees but are not hard or bulky. I wash them in the wash machine and come out as new again.
2,"When it works, sounds great","I had this receiver for 28 days, about the 20th day the volume spiked to maximum on its own and almost blew my speakers. On the 28th day, the sound degraded to that of an old AM radio just before it stopped sending sound to the speakers completely. It came back to life on and off a couple of times before I pulled out every cable and boxed it up. While it was working it sounded very warm. powerful, and the imaging was great. This unit gets hot, much hotter than it should. I've since read the reviews at audioreview and wish I had before purchasing this receiver. I think H/K dropped the ball on the avr45, avr65, and avr85. I went to Circuit City after XMAS and saw 6 returned AVR's on the shelves, 45's , 65's and 85's. That told me something. I was willimg to live with only one optical input, no DTS and no A/B speakers, but not after the gremlins took hold of it. Sounds like a processor problem throughout the line. Maybe the new 300, 500 series will be like the H/K of old."
4,Definitely for high-end 'mass audio' users,"HK makes some of the best high-current amps available to the mass-consumer market. If one owns better speakers from this range such as Pinnacle, DCM, Yamaha, JBL, Bose, etc. then HK amps make a much better choice for clarity and definition of sound. (Sorry Kenwood does not compare)."
3,"Liked it, didn't love it--though it is obviously useful...","I liked the ""Detox Box"" but didn't love it. I found the format with the cards and tiny little printed information to be awkward to easily use. I ended up looking at it after opening it and then I either donated it or gave it away. I think I expected something different than what it was (I thought it was like a self-facilitated workshop kit). I did LOVEThe UltraSimple Dietby Dr. Hyman which I had bought previously (I liked it so well I bought and shared about five copies with other people). His concepts work, ant the ""Detox Box"" concepts are the same as his other books so maybe it will work for you."
4,Well Put Together But Too Expensive And Time Consuming,I purchased this after reading other reviews here. Love how this is all put together but have not started using it yet so only gave it 4 stars and will update my review after trying this out soon. Follow up..This is a very very expensive way to do a healthy detox and unreasonable I think...such a pretty box and well put together but just too much work and too expensive to purchase everything...sorry but there are so many other ways to do this that will not cost a fortune and with the same results so I am lowering this to 2 stars.
1,Do not buy this item!,Do not buy this product or any other product with the Perfect Pour Carafe. The brilliant designers at Black & Decker thought that they would improve on a centuries old design by incorporating a plastic spout on the glass carafe. The problem is that the coffee flows in between the two and on to the floor or whatever else you are pouring over. Nice work guys. One call to their Customer Service line was cut off. On the next I chose the option to leave a message and be called back--unfortunately the mailbox was full. I guess the poor product deserves poor customer service.
2,Not too happy with this seller,"The filters are what they are, no problems there. Where I am disappointed is in the seller. The items arrived lose in a box, no packaging, wrapping, nothing but the packing slip. I felt a bit mislead by the description of it being a 2 pack (thought that might mean they were packaged). More than that, I'm disappointed in the shipping rate I was charged. They charged a flat fee of $6.95. When the box arrived, the postage was $2.19. Enough of a difference that the next time I am in the market for a replacement filter, I will be looking elsewhere."
3,Too Much of a Good Thing,"My first impression was ""Wow, the author drastically improved his literary style since writing 'The Water Is Wide'. His prose has become beautiful in addition to being humorous and interesting.""My second impression was that the depiction of an abusive father, of whom his family says they are terrified, does not seem authentic. How many cringing adolescents or battered wives speak to abusive fathers/husbands this caustically without bringing on a beating? Are children really ever this witty while denouncing their fathers to their faces??My third impression: the story drags after the first 350 pages."
2,This one really drags.,"It was somewhat painful for me to finish this novel. Conroy is certainly a gifted writer, but he could have made this novel about 300 pages shorter. Some of the stories are particularly boring (i.e. the white porpoise). Don't read this book unless you want to give yourself nightmares."
4,Tragic and Engaging,"Conroy writes with exceptional poetry and describes the South with such passion. He creates characters with immense intensity and life, regardless of how flawed they are. Prince of Tides is not a joyful book. While there are uplifting scenes, there is a pervading sadness. The topics of suicide, abuse and despair bestow a melancholy that cannot be redeemed regardless of how many inspiring anecdotes Conroy includes, though there is an underlying hope that timidly presents itself. I found Prince of Tides to be Conroy's darkest book, but as always, I appreciate his extraordinary writing. He narrates Tom Wingo well, exploring the history of his troubled family. Between his abusive father, his delusional and infuriating mother, his unfortunate brother, his suicidal sister and the tragic things that happen to them, it is no wonder Tom is a deeply unhappy and conflicted man. The history of the Wingo family is splendidly detailed and instilled with a magic that only Conroy can convey."
3,OK...but I found the movie to be better,"I read this book only because someone mentioned to me that it is better than the movie. I loved the movie and thought it was great. I liked seeing the interaction between Tom and the psychiatrist. And it was a great love story. However, I thought the book left a little to be desired. I thought it was long-winded. I got bored reading about the Wingo history, I guess. I know this was necessary for the story in the book, but it just wasn't my thing. There were a few twists that were good and that aren't in the movie, but not too much suspense. Some sections I found hard to get through and boring. It didn't hold my attention that well. However, that is just me. I guess I am more of a mystery/suspense reader. So, if you are like me, this book might not be for you. But, like a movie, it is always better to determine these things for yourself."
4,Meandering and Cosy,"This is a cosy book, one to settle down and ponder. The book provides a view of two different American Worlds and how bitter and twisted families can make you even if it is unwarranted.Whilst at times the book is a little slow it is compelling enough to want to keep the pages turning until the end."
4,You either love it or you hate it.,"It took me three serious attempts to read this book, and I never would have made it to the third were it not for one of the most poetic ""preludes"" in contemporary fiction. I loved this book, but it's not for everyone. The reader who comes from a fully functional family will probably wonder if it's all a construct. But for the gentle reader from a dysfunctional family (meaning all of us), this is a compelling, and deeply satisfying read. I couldn't put it down. This is Conroy's best work by far."
4,Highs and Lows,"These 664 pages span about 40 years in the life of Tom Wingo, as he tries to understand why his sister Savannah has attempted suicide again. Absorbing at times, while boring at other times. (B+)"
4,Good Used Book,The paperback book I purchased was in the shape it was avertized to be. The book itself is a great read. I recommend it to everyone.
2,I don't get it,"I am clearly in the minority with my opinion, but I found it difficult to get through this book. I found Tom, the central character, to be a whiny, self-centered, self-pitying, sarcastic person. I found that the dialogue did not ring true. Conversations between Tom and Susan were annoying to read when each character said the other's name in almost every sentence. Savannah as a child did not sound like a child; she spoke as though she were an adult. Tom's incessant whining about his horrible childhood was irritating. Lots of people had worse childhoods Tom, get over it. And his ""humor"" was just not funny to me."
1,It is hard to understand the success of this book.,"All novels require a suspension of disbelief, but this one was too much for me. It uses the hoary device of Freudian analysis as a means of structuring the story. The great traumatic secret that this analysis eventually uncovers is so over the top as to be funny rather than horrifying; one would like to know what Flannery O'Connor would have thought of it. As much as others love this book, for me almost everything in it rang false."
1,Waste of time,"Overly flowery and melodramatic language predominate in this novel about a dysfunctional family in South Carolina, yet the subject itself, physical and emotional abuse within the family, is poorly explored. The characters are one-dimensional and inconsistent. The plot is not very well developed with a number of gaping holes the reader is expected to believe will be understood later, a later that doesn't somehow come, while some preposterous situations are given many pages of romanticized nonsense to fill in the gaps.I can't imagine where all the good reviews come from because I found this to be a boring and pointless read. The dreadful ending just caps it all off. A real waste of time."
4,Fantastic,"Pat Conroy really is a poet. I've never read another author who can craft words so beautifully. My only complaint is that the book is so long, but it's almost necessary. I've been picking up and putting it down since last summer, but I'm so glad I finally finished it."
5,ROMAN POLANSKI'S CLASSIC SHOCKER.....,"Finally, Roman Polanski's classic 1965 shocker is coming to DVD through Criterion . There have been inferior copies around for years, but it appears the wait for a proper edition is over. With it's stark b&w photography and the unforgettably haunting performance of Catherine Deneuve, ""Repulsion"" is one of those films that stays with you after you've seen it. Deneuve plays a young woman left alone in the apartment she shares with her sister while the sister goes away for a holiday with her boyfriend. She is then beset with terrifying hallucinations that culminate in a couple of murders. Deneuve virtually carries the film along with some disturbing visuals and a creepy music score. Polanski keeps the film mostly within the apartment so that the audience feels the claustrophobia and horror with Deneuve. ""Repulsion"" is one of the finest psychological horror films ever made and is a must see. For those who appreciate it, it will give you the creeps."
3,a shocking film,"This review is for the Criterion Collection DVD edition of the filmRepulsion is a film directed by Roman Polanski and is his first English language film. It is about two sisters from Belgium who are living together in a London apartment. While one goes on vaction, the other decends into schizophrenia and madness. The film is a psychological thriller and was given an X rating in the UK upon its release. It is indeed dusturbing and I recommend it not be shown to children.Unlike the previous Roman Polanski film released on DVD by the Criterion Collection, Knife in the Water, it is possible to pause this film, and to scan the film forwards and backwards.The DVD includes a 2003 documentary on the film's production, a 1964 French documentary about the film's production, Audio commentary from 1994 with Roman Polanski and actress Catherine Deneuve, and two theatrical trailers."
5,Disturbingly good!,"I loved this movie! It was released nearly 50 years ago, only the second film Roman Polanski made in English. A young, gorgeous Catherine Deneuve is perfectly cast as the damaged central character. This movie is dark and psychologically twisted - don't expect an uplifting, lighthearted experience!"
1,A disputable PIECE,"The good: Acting.The bad : Dialog.I can't believe those good reviews: "" my #1 all time horror movie.""????? ""There is not a shot or a frame wasted ""????? If you saw the movie, you'd know how ridiculous that comment is - Almost nothing happens in the movie. It's agonizing. My only explanation for the praise is that watching a crazy person leaving rotting food out and aimlessly wandering around for 1.5 hours makes the viewer crazy.The only `shocking' thing about this movie is the killing, and the lack of anything else."
4,Almost perfect except...,"I only have one negative comment about this newly released Toshiba design. When switching stations, I hear a ""whump"" in the first moment of sound. It seems like a dampening problem in the design. Probably only audiophiles will notice it, however. Other than that, I think it is an excellent buy for the money."
2,Average Movie,"No big stars, budget or special effects here. Average acting and story line with a number of loop holes (as someone else mentioned). Maybe a good family movie or young person's movie. If you don't have high expectations and you want to watch an adventure movie without swearing, violence or sex etc. it is a movie for general exhibition. It is a movie you wouldn't watch more than once."
5,Very good,This high end production by Hallmark is very well done and a must see for all fans of pirate films. It is full of action and adventure and is a competitor with the Pirates of the Caribbean films. Beautifully produced with great acting--be sure to add this to your family movie collection.
1,Marginally entertaining,"Blackbeard's real story is far more entertaining than what Hallmark gave us for this two-part DVD, which clearly was done only to pander to the current pirate fever.If you want purely fictional fun, see ""Captain Blood."" True it's in b&w;, but the film is very well done with no rough cuts for commercials and a storyline and acting that keep you on your seat.If you want real, check out the History Channel's series on pirates.I'd give this one a miss. Very glad I rented it instead of investing in the DVD."
3,Protocols for teachers' meetings...,"This book was not quite what I expected. Silly me, I had expected something about how protocols would lead directly to school or academic improvement. Instead, this is a book about how to run reflective teachers' meetings in schools. The book presents about four dozen ""starting points"" for teacher in-service trainers, and ways to ""run"" the conversation(s). It really was not bad, but I had a hard time seeing why the authors used the word ""power"" in the title.I suppose this sort of thinking has some place in American education. I had a hard time seeing exactly how this would lead to ""better practice,"" however, or why a teacher in-service educator would pick a particular protocol over another, because most of the protocols seemed roughly similar."
1,major design flaws,"Sharp design, only problem is they put form over function when designing it. First problem, if the water hasn't drained completely from the upper (non filtered) basin, and you try and pour the pitcher, the unfiltered water pours out with the filtered water. Second problem, when you fill it up, if you let the water overflow the basin, the first thing it does is drain into the filtered basin. In the older round designs, the upper basin was water tight with the lid on, so you could pour out filtered water before the upper basin was empty. If you overflowed the upper basin the water would got over the side and not into the filtered basin. This allowed the user to set it under the sink and not have to stand there for 30 second to shut off the water. They took a definite step backwards with this design. It's really amazing that in the year 2005, such bad product design is still making to the store shelves."
2,"Looks better, but not durable","I bought this pitcher because it looks a little better than the standard ones. Unfortunately it has some durability problems that are common to Brita pitchers and also some of its own.1) The first thing that broke was the little plastic hinge like things that hold the large lid on. This has broken on every Brita I've owned and I don't understand why they don't make it more durable-well, I guess they sell more this way.2) The ""chrome"" finish on the underside of the lid has started to peel off. This is disturbing and I am concerned about this stuff falling into the water.3) The front pouring hinge seems to freeze in the 'frig sometimes-which is weird because I think it is plastic. The result is that water runs out the sides (and usually onto the table) instead of into the glass.Like I mentioned, it initially looked better than the other Britas, but I'm tired of them breaking and so I will get a different brand next time."
4,"Saves on buying bottle water, great for environment.","Saves on buying bottle water, great for environment by not buying plastic bottles and throwing them away. Water tastes great and is always cold."
1,Top falls off,"We've had this pitcher for a year or so. I don't know why I haven't thrown it a way yet, the top either falls off when your pouring or the littlehinge thing gets jammed and your water spews out in funny directions.this combined with tthe ridiculous size and shape of the pitcher make it one of the stupidest products I have had to use."
1,Might as well drink toilet water,I have a Kinetico water system. The filters on it need to be replaced again so I tried a Brita pitcher water filter to save me a hundred bucks on the kinetico filters and to see if it was even close in flavor.. Man I thought I was drinking gutter water!!! Unless you like the flavor of gutter water save your money.. Maybe the Kinetico system spoiled me but thats my opinion!! (p.s. Ive never tasted gutter water before but I needed something to compare the water to!)
4,Gift for mother,"Got this for my mother. It came busted up in the mail. Amazon replaced it very quickly and hassle free. Easy to use. Just be careful, the plastic is not very durable."
1,Don't buy this pitcher!,"I bought this item in March 2007 Brita Chrome Pitcher. I liked the look of the chrome and the slim design of the pitcher. Last week, I took the sensor off and placed it on my counter top so that I could wash the pitcher. I splashed a few drops (yes, drops) of water onto the ""sensor"" (really only a glorified timer) and now the sensor no longer functions. Pretty useless for a sensor that is designed for use on the top of a water pitcher. It was too wimpy to stand up to a couple of drops of water. So, in my opinion, do not spend the extra money for the ""timer."" There is nothing Smart about this ""Smart"" pitcher."
5,Fun Battle Droid Set,"This enjoyable set has a sleek design and appearance. It comes with lots of Battle Droids, and has storage space inside. The back portion has an activity center inside with computer consoles, etc.The one drawback: it's a little pricey. I would have liked to have bought several, but at around ..., one is definitely enough.Still, overall, it's a great set to have. I highly recommend it."
5,A fully playable toy!,"I was extremely hesitant about spending [the money] on a lego set. The last time I did that I bought the Y-Wing and Tie-Intercepter set which included 2 models.I was pleasantly suprised after building the model and realized that the picture of the set is deceptively simple. Although it doesn't look like much, it turns out to be a very complex toy which is very playable. Doors open to expose guns and a pilot station. The entire model separates into two pieces with the rear piece unfolding into an operations center. It also includes a clever Battle Droid rack which slides into the front of the model just like in the movie.Overall, this turns out to be one of the best star wars lego sets."
3,box was cheap,"the box was cheap and the tools didn stay in there spots ,,,,,besides that it was ok. kjibi jkno knon kjbijhb gfctc uvuyv yufvytv gytv y gyu y u uyb tr 5r6ty vy"
3,Not really what I expected,"I really thought that the items would fit much better in the alotted spaces in the case. They do not. I ordered three of these for Christmas, and I wrapped them with the items in the case just rolling around in there. It sounded awful."
4,Great tools for a great price,"The tools in this box were in great quality and the assortment of tools is perfect. The only negative is the box which was not in very good condition, small cracks in some areas. For the price, I would recommend as a buy."
3,Straight Shaver from Pakistan,"Cheap plastic sides w/no structural support beneath,sharp blade w/ interesting Timber Rattler logo on blade and ""hilt"". feels good in hand and took off some wiskers dry shaving. Overall impression - Cheap Straight razor from Pakistan where the Taliban don't ever shave."
3,Steadicam,"If you are buying these to make the steadicam, they are not the right size. Otherwise it seems like a fine product."
5,THIS IS THE PRODUCT THAT I HAVE BEEN LOOKING FOR. THANKS HP!,"This product has ended my all pains. It saves my time and also my money. Forget about the small printers, try this one and you will love it. Fax from your pc, take a copy, e-mail it... Do whatever you would like to. Also, it's scanner is awsome, it takes less than 10 seconds to scan a complex color photo. Perfect... Pefect.. Perfect... I love my HP!"
2,too much to expect,I didn't think this book was very good. I think too much guessing went on and the book didn't focus on JonBenet's murder at all. He is saying that a Ramsey sexually abused the child and that is why she died. I would not reccommend this book!
1,Utter rubbish,"John Ramsey has a bi-sexual boat, and Patsy Ramsey murdered her child to restore her fertility, and brown paper bags are symbols of femininity, come on. How dumb. Why hasn't any one in newspapers or radio mentioned this new breadthrough, ""the deeper mind"". Never mind that John E. Douglas who has caught many criminals, fails to find the anger in John Ramsey, on and on. Only this man's brilliant mind can find a solution to a murder.Pathetic."
3,"An interesting read, whether you agree with it or not.","I had several problems with what was written in the book, but I still enjoyed reading it. The basis of his argument makes us take on faith that his theory and methodology are accurate. I felt that more lead-in was necessary, to set the stage for how he will find the answers he wants in the note. Instead, he jumps right in, and we are expected to blindly follow. As a result, I never did really trust that what he was deducing was indeed correct, although certain areas I felt truly did at least support the theory that Patsy did it.So, 3 stars for an intersting and thought-provoking read. More stars if he had been able to really convince me it all made sense."
3,Triple feature of Duke western programmers,"JOHN WAYNE WESTERN COLLECTION is part of BRIDGESTONE's ""American Classics"" series of public domain motion pictures. This one is a triple-play of Duke's pre-STAGECOACH programmers. The tape is not dubbed at SP speed, so video quality does suffer some. These antique films haven't undergone restoration, which further reduces clarity. They're watchable but far from pristine.PROGRAM--Parenthetical numbers preceding titles are 1 to 10 imdb viewer poll ratings.(5.2) The Dawn Rider (1935) - John Wayne/Marion Burns/Dennis Moore/Reed Howes/Yakima Canutt/Earl Dwire(5.2) Texas Terror (1935) - John Wayne/Lucile Browne/LeRoy Mason/Fern Emmett/George 'Gabby' Hayes(5.7) Riders of Destiny (1933) - John Wayne/Cecilia Parker/Forrest Taylor/George 'Gabby' Hayes/Al St. John/Heinie Conklin/Yakima Canutt/Earl Dwire/Lafe McKee"
3,Not for digital cameras,"I purchased this product for printing 4x6 photos from my digital camera. As soon as I opened it it was very thin, which is not for digital cameras. So if you are considering it for digital camera printing, I highly recommend you go with a thicker paper."
2,DIDN'T WORK FOR ME,"After reading dozens of reviews that talked about the increase in energy and other positive benefits of Bio Strath, I ordered the tablets with high hopes. Unfortunately this product had the opposite effect on me. It was like taking 2 sleeping pills. I got so drowsy and listless that I had to drink 2 cups of very strong coffee just to stay awake. So disappointing! Herbs and formulas like these affect everyone differently so I can't fault the produce per se. I was just so hoping to find a product that would eliminate or at least diminish my chronic fatigue. It was worth a try. Now on to Rhodiola Rosea to see if that will work. The shipping by this seller was very fast and packaged well, so was grateful for that."
2,Be forewarned,"Be forewarned....the very opening of the movie on this DVD has been truncated. The source for these transfers is evidently a program hosted by Roy and Dale in their later years. While I have no problem with the DVD's containing the intros, I did not pay for a movie that is not in its entirety...COMPLETE opening credits and all.Secondly, the source is not good either. Roan Group did a much better job with their Roy Roger movie transfers.In spite of being ""Authorized by the Roy Rogers Estate""...which made me this a safe purchase....these Happy Trails Theatre DVD's are anything BUT high quality."
4,The short course,This well written book covers a subject that has only been treated lightly in other art metal books. The pictures done for the book are not the best of contrast and size. But they do show the subject matter that the number of the picture list to the description. That really is the only fault I found with it.Covering the use of equipment and materials. some people will be in the shop or studio after the first 10 pages looking for the sheet of rubber and the car bottle jack. This is and will become the first classic in this subjects field. I own it.
5,Fantastic Backpack!,"What a great find... I was delighted when I received this backpack. I ordered 2, one for each of my boys and was a bit hestitant in ordering something of this nature without being able to hold, touch and feel it; I was concerned it may be too small. I was pleasantly surprised to find they are made from quality nylon fabric, have sturdy zippers and the inside compartments are HUGE! My 6th grader is able to adequately carry books home each night without struggling to fit them inside the backpack.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"
1,don't order,"too bad!amazon and henckels cheat meI delivered another henckels twin signature 7-piece block set2in, 3in, 4in, 8in, scissors, sharpening"
1,Quite disappointed for Henckels.,We own a set of 2-Man Pro series and this set did not even compare. Returned them the same day they arrived to my house.
1,dont waste money on this,"I returned this piece of Junk.1) Maps are old2) If you are looking for good customer service, there aint any.3) Quality of GPS receiver is no good. Does not connect most of the times.4) If you switch off and switch back on, it wont find the satellite. You would need to exit the navigation mode and come back again.5) Bluetooth works well6) No voice conversion"
1,A WHITE ELEPHANT,"From the specifications and HP's reputation, this sounded like a wonderful machine - Combine many functions and save space. However, after 3 software upgrades, 3 hardware replacements, an entire machine replacement, 2 operating system reinstalls, and ~50 hours on the phone, I would actively discourage anyone from buying this. HP's final solution was to simply buy it back from me after acknowledging it had serious problems. The software never worked and caused many other computer problems, the fax never reliably worked, and the machine would often disconnect the phone about 3 seconds after someone called. I am about to replace it with a Brother 9200."
1,Worst Electronic Device I Ever Purchased,This is the most inferior device I ever purchased. It has been a problem from day one and HP support is inept. Stay far away!
4,Love It,"This movie was a real good movie. It was like I wanted it to be. Ryan Sypek, was very good. Of course it was pretty easy to figure out what was going to happen in the end. But other than that, there was action throughout the whole movie."
2,Quiet but fragile,"I got this on the recommendation of a college professor. We needed hard drives for class and I had no idea how to choose one. I should have checked Amazon first, because the reviews are accurate on this one. Another girl got the same drive, dropped it at a low height on a cushioned surface, and lost everything. She couldn't even turn it on. I learned to handle mine like a half broken egg. Even with all that extra attention, I somehow managed to bend the tiny metal prong inside the end of the cable that plugs into the hard drive. The other girl generously gave me her cable. I've long graduated from college and I haven't unplugged the cable from the drive since. The drive itself stays in one place. I'm considering buying a different brand just for peace of mind, but I'm too lazy to do the research and legwork of transferring all my files onto a new drive. Just don't buy this in the first place."
4,Rosie the Riveter,"I also think that too many pieces seemed to fit together that actually did not fit together. There are also big areas of the same color, which is difficult, but fun if you like that kind of challenge."
5,A page-turner,"Ms. Simmons has done it again! I started it late last night and couldn't put it down. ""Georgie"" was a delightful investigator and Ashdowne an amusing ""Assistant."" I especially enjoyed all her amusing ""exploits"" or ""adventures"" in trying to solve the crime. Two thumbs up!"
5,Spectacular,"This was the first romance book I had ever read. I was one of those girls that was strictly interested in fantasy, wizards etc. But since then I have become a hopeless romantic. I have at least 11 other romance books and none of them even competes with this book. It has romance, an actual plot and is riviting with suspense. If you have to read one book this summer let it be this one."
2,1917 Canon Law Code,Very slow shipping. Product did not arrive as promised. I almost forgot about this book. Seller did not even contact me to tell me what happened. BAD SHOPPING EXPERIENCE.
5,A Very Good Book,"This is a very good book. In my opinion, it is a perfect first book for anyone who is interested in learning more about holistic health or holistic parenting. It is interesting, informative and easy to read. One of the more surprising and enjoyable qualities of the book is the clarity and familiarity of Sneyd's writing style. It makes the reader feel as if they were sitting down over coffee with a childhood friend and sharing what they've been up to the last decade. Sneyd has obviously been on a voyage of discovery and has shared her experiences with insight and good humor. I would definitely recommend it for anyone who is curious about holistic health."
1,"Filter works, attachments don't...","We have gone through 3 of these in 2 years. The actual water filter works great but the way it attaches to your sink will eventually fail and end up spraying you or completely falling off. The attachment parts are plastic and if the threads don't get stripped while you put it on the first time, they will eventually wear down and then there is nothing you can do except shell out more bucks for a new one - mainly just for the little plastic threaded connector. Also, the indicator light is not 100% reliable. I recall it flashing red for weeks even though we had just put a brand new filter in the holder."
4,easy,one of the easiest filters to install. differance from tap to this filter was amazing. water tasted better and was very clear in color.
1,"It'll fall off, you'll be sad.","This generation of the product seems to have a flawed connection to your faucet. The plastic threads that hold it to the faucet will strip, and it'll constantly fall off. Taking out the washer helps a little bit, but... turn on your faucet to a reasonable level... it'll fall off again.Naturally it does this at inconvenient times, spraying all around with water. You might want to take a pass on this product for a while.Pluses-- it filters! The 3 modes are nice.Downsides-- after a while, the battery (?) will die, so it won't give you the LED indication on when to change the filter. This'll happen after around a year... assuming the aformentioned fatal flaw doesn't kill it first."
1,What happened?,"I bought one of these about 6 years ago. It worked well, never fell off. I could taste the difference in my water. The light stopped working, so I decided to buy a new one recently. What a waste of money! It has cheaper parts-the plastic adapter is ridiculous. I went to the hardware store and got a metal one. Now, instead of falling off three times a days it falls off once every three or four days. I will try to use it until the filter wears out and then buy something else. This filter is absolutely terrible. Unbelievable how much the quality has declined from six years ago."
4,Brita on-tap black/chrome water filter,"It works as promised, I'm very happy with the functionality (clean water, fast, easy, little green light indicator, etc).I only gave it 4 stars because it's a little plastic-ey looking. I'd have happilly paid a little more for one that wasn't quite so ""I'm plastic pretending to be chrome."", or if it has to be plastic, why make it chrome colored? It's not fooling anyone. Why not make it translucent plastic, tinted in a bright color, so I could see the stuff inside?"
2,Doesn't last,"I agree with most of the reviews already written for this. The bottom line is that if you've had this for a short period of time it is great. Water tastes great, everything is fine but after a year coincidentally about the same time the warranty is up the plastic threads holding it to the faucet start to weaken and water leaks until eventually one day you're washing the dishes with very hot water and it springs a major leak and sprays scalding hot water on you.Given the price, even if you bought a new one of these every year or so (my most recent one lasted almost a year and a half) it's still cheaper and better for the environment than bottled water. I'm about ready to switch brands and try something different."
5,Red Sox Sticker,This sticker is a fancy Red Sox sticker I got for my dad as a gift. Looks nice and is super sticky.
3,Doesn't play well with others.,On its own this hot sauce is great. A few drops is all you needfor most foods. But try to mix it with anything and dissapears like it was never there. Added quite a bit to regular size bottle of Bullseye and barely got a lip tingle. Not a bad buy but if your planning to mix it dont bother.
3,"Ok, not great","I really LOVE the MSW series, but this is a WEAK entry. None of the additional characters have any substance, to the point that the reader does not even care who/why the murder happened. There is also an unfortunate sub-plot of wanting to run anyone remotely different/new out of town, which also does not sit well with me as someone who has moved frequently."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PRINTER!,"I have had nothing but trouble with this printer! The first one arrives, get it set up, print a couple of pages, then, ""COMMUNICATION ERROR""! I spend 20 mintues on the phone to the Epson support hotline LONG DISTANCE to California from Indiana. It seems to be working O.K after reinstalling the drivers, then two days later, I get the same message. SOOO, Amazon is nice enough to send another. It arrives with the printer ink bar not enough attatched inside, backwards!! I'll never buy anything from EPSON!"
1,S h i t ? ? ?,"This printer have not power switch to turn off. It is written in service manual that ONE BLACK CARTRIGE = 300 print sheets of paper, in practice ONE BLACK CARTRIGE = ONLY 100~150 print sheets of paper. Indicator of ink level is very inaccurate, it happens that it shows that ink cartrige is empty, but after taking out in it are placed a lot else ink :(("
4,kinda dissapointed,"If u want to get this game, get it! It's not up to me to decide but I will give you a pointer. Don't do it! This game has excellent graphics and realistic but the statistics bite and the season mode is entirely pathetic! So if you like graphic and realistic games buy it. But if you like games with good statistical records, please please please do not buy it."
3,Cheap,"This system is more of a stereo than a home theater system. The only good thing about it is the subwoofer. The thin speakers produce less than acurate sound and rattle in hi-treble situations like piano or rap songs. Insignia is notorious for poor quality products at a low price, dont expect miracles, expect what is normal for $100."
5,Bonneville dies at highway speed,This and control module solved my issue with the car suddenly dieing at highway speed and also solved my tach from jumping around.
5,A great album from a great musician,"Put it on, sit back and Merrell takes you to another place and time. With great arrangements and lots of famous musicians on-board, Merrell's lyrics guide you on a musicial journey as he rediscovers the lost continent of Mu."
2,I suppose...,"This Lego SW model is one of the more interetsing on the market, but sadly one of the least fun. A fairly easy to build model, the set lacks extra features like hatchs or control pads.For a solid model, you would think Lego may have put a little extra in but the only working features are; the door which folds down to load Han Solo and the cockpit lid.It is a good addition to your collection since it contains both Boba Fett and Han Solo in frozen carbonite.I would not recomend parents to buy this for kids since I can see them bored VERY easily by it."
2,Doesn't Hold Up When Used As A Toy,"Good excercise in building and painting, but not for playing. This didn't hold up well when played with as a toy. I think it's great that the kid can put it together and then decorate it, but, after they do that, it'd probably be better to put it on display on a shelf and not let anyone play with it or else the parts will start snapping."
2,Oh please.,"Oh no, Lego have got to be joking. The most awful alien life forms ever seen on the TV or cinema screen are brought out in plastic form. This set is worth it for novelty value, I suppose, and it does have some useful pieces like those giant radar dish wheels and those blue lights. And being able to inflict whatever kind of torture you desire on Jar Jar Binks is worth anybody's money."
3,"Not good picture quality, but it is WIDESCREENED!","There is really somethign for everybody here. Amazon has the golgo movie for $39 right now! While that is the worst movie in this 3-pack, it was still almost worth watching. But bullet train is a really good movie that has no action but keeps you in suspense and has some really good acting. The Executioner is the real reason you should buy this. Not quite as good as the Streetfighter, but just as cheesy. I think that is all I will say, the Executioner is an absolute classic in the exploitation genre.So all in all this is a really good buy."
5,This book changed my life!,"As an Ayurveda practitioner for the last nine years I highly recommend this book which offers a new slant on this ancient system of healing. This book changed my thinking about Ayurveda, and truly ""revolutionized"" the way I work with clients. In it, the author claims to have rediscovered a more ancient system of Ayurveda that goes back to a time when Ayurveda and a True Science Of The Stars were one system. This system focuses less on Constitution, and instead places emphasis on the way the body goes out of balance, which he calls the Seven Disease Tendencies. This is a controversial book because it challenges our assumptions about Ayurveda, but if approached with an open mind it could yield great riches for you."
1,An inferior model,"I was very disappointed with the HP 3200se. I previously owned an HP 3100 (their earlier-model all-in-one with the same feature set) and was very happy with it, but when it was time for a replacement, I found to my vast regret that the 3200 is much less functional. The software is much more difficult to configure and use, and it was easier to disregard HP's ""document manager"" software entirely. The fax module was no longer compatible with my telephone and answering machine (although the old model had been); the fax often cut in and interrupted voice calls, and never worked reliably. I wouldn't buy this model again."
3,My Favorite Candy But-o-Honey,I found the candy to be harder than I had expected. It came in bar form and it is rather hard to chew but just as tasty--just takes more chewing to enjoy!!
5,Los Idolos de Mexico,"Luis Miguel & Mijares are truely idolos, I as many grew up listening to their romantic songs that even now a days make us feel like we did years ago when we first heard them."
1,Buy something else,This projector lacks many features including A/V mute. It uses a propritary video cable that has broken on my unit twice. Had to order replacement cable from Infocus store at a premium price. Lamp life is really bad. Had two bulbs explode (yes explode and smoke)in the unit. Now I am having trouble getting another replacement lamp. If I want a new lamp I have to send it back to Infocus to get a power supply upgrade. This thing is a hunk of junk - nothing good to say about it. I will never buy an Infocus product again!
4,"nice piece, a bit expensive","used a dremel tool to cut this to contours of the dashboard on our minivan. drilled two holes in the top to screw it down to the dash. this has a threaded tab for IF you are installing it in a specific vehicle, but it can be made to be universal if you carve on it. For $45 or so, you don't want to mess up...SunPro gauges fit in it... barely... the lamps will press up against the top of the housing. Gauge fit is snug enough that the gauge brackets were not needed.I haven't found another pod like this. It was the right item to get - but if someone had the same thing for less, I'd have been all over it. It can't have cost more than $3 to produce.M"
4,terrific television,Very nice picture for a non-flat screen. Settup a breeze. Easy full function remote. TV is in our kitchen/dinette area and is perfect to throw a tape in for the kiddies. Value for the dollar here is unbeatable.
5,Dymaxion Daydream: Headphone FlipBoomBlap!,"I'd been reading articles by c.Jones for years in Tape Op, was freaked out by one of his circuit-bent Speak & Math toys (it threatened to loose a thousand electric bees into my entrails) and have been rocking some old songs of his I downloaded a long time ago. Here he comes, though, with this FAT record that melds some glitched out/intricate freak-edits (swimming all around you) with lung-slamming kickBooms. He does a great job pushing this monster along with returning (melodic/aural) themes and lots of weirdness, all paced perfectly. BIG UPS for this work Mr. Jones."
1,Stink,"There are too many Mario dolls. Who would want to buy another one. If you want to be broke, then get every doll. Mario is retard."
4,get it for the pendant and not for the chain,I think this pendant is beautiful. people don't even know what it is or how symbolic it is for me and they compliment me on it all the time. the chain that comes with it however - like another said broke within a week. it had numerous kinks in it when it came before i even put it on that i had to get out.just not a good chain at all. but i didn't buy it for the chain i bought it for the pendant and the pendant looks exactly like its picture and is in wonderful condition and i've been wearing it for weeks.many compliments and i absolutely love it. not too heavy - not too big - i feel its just right for a necklace and i wear it daily.i would buy this again - i'd just make sure i also bought a chain for it
4,"Gentle, but powerful.","Reiki is the form of energy healing that is most well-known in contemporary metaphysics, but Kolaimni deserves to be known as well.It is gentle, hands-free, and deeply calming. But it has surprising power. While Reiki energy to me is very ""hot,"" Kolaimni is very ""cool."" But the fact that it is meant to be offered free of charge, and is so quiet... don't let that deceive you.This text is the introductory work, usually given or available at Kolaimni Level One classes. It covers the basics, and if you have some metaphysical experience you can pick it up and get started right away. However, if you're new to energy healing, then I recommend getting in touch with a Kolaimni teacher first. At least that's what worked for me.If I was reviewing the discipline itself, it would be 5 stars, obviously. :)I continue to be amazed how unknown Mechi is. I trust, though, that this powerful healing will reach wherever it is most needed. <3"
5,It's a salsa essential,"I have to be honest, I've only heard a couple of the songs, and they were great.CADERAS!"
4,fun to assemble,i liked this product because i like to assemble things and i collect unusual cars and trucks. i have left this plain but you can paint or stain this and make it look however you want. the only thing that i did not like about this is that some of the screws were a little short and some stripped easly. other than that a good toy and i will buy some of the other ones they have.
1,Not worth it!,"OK,to put it plainly It's not worth my money. Look if I am going to pay out of my hard earned money, you better give a respectable lesson. What did I learn? Nothing! The DVD starts out with a brief history but then when it comes to the form you learn nothing, he does not tell, what he is doing, and why he is doing it. No explaining nothing. In short I wonder if he even knows himself. MY suggestion go with Steve Desmasco Leopard form, if want to learn anything. Then find a school!"
5,Refreshing approach,"This was a refreshing approach to triathlon. I read a lot of scientific books geared towards the 'type A' personality athlete, (which I am not). It was great to read someone's take on preparing for an Ironman who seemed to take the experiences as they came with out too much pressure. Great read! I lent it to an athlete I coach who lent it to someone else too."
2,Not very amusing...,"Looking at the title I expected amusing anecdotes and maybe even a tri joke or two. I was disappointed and not amused. I barely broke a smile throughout the entire book.This was an inferior version of ""Becoming an Ironman : First Encounters with the Ultimate Endurance Event"", which is an excellent read."
2,"Warning, not item as pictured!",I ordered these cute little socks and was so excited that I finnally broke down and ordered them. But they are not as pictured! These ones have actual bows on the back of them. and they don't even look like balarina socks. Very disappointed. I am returning. Now i'm sceptical to order again from seller.
5,Curb Your Enthusiasm - The Complete First Three Seasons,Absolutely hilarious! Larry David is the genious behind Seinfeld!
5,This is a great product!!,This cake eyeliner requires a brush that you wet then you moisten the cake liner with the moist brush. This eyeliner is terrific and is not messy. It goes on smooth and looks really beautiful. It is exactly what I wanted when I ordered it and I bought 3 packages so that I would always have it. I like a good eyeliner but this beats out the liquid brands. It is a perfect eyeliner that goes nicely and stays where you put it. It is easy to correct with aq-tip if you smear it.
5,great eyeliner,Cake eyeliner takes practice. I have been using cake eyeliner for decades. The color is darker than Clinique brown. Wet your angle brush and really wet the product. get in right in the lash line. It dries quickly and doesn't budge. It will come off with soap and water or mild makeup remover.
4,I highly recomend this camera,"I bought this camera for my father for christmas and he LOVES it. I personally have a Minolta Maxxum 5 SLR and LOVE it, that's why I bought this one. takes GREAT pics once you get used to the auto focus."
4,shop vac outdoor,I ordered this vacuum to keep my driveway clear of leaves and it has done a great job. The only fault I found with it is the stand. With any load in the bag it does not hold the vacuum up. Needs a bigger and flat stand to keep it upright. I am very happy with my purchase. Denzel Wallace
1,Useless due to no replacement bag,"DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT YOU WILL BE RIPPED OFF WHEN YOU NEED A REPLACEMENT BAG - THERE IS NONE!This is a great product but is useless becasue you cannot find a replacement bag. I have tried 16 sources from Walmart, to Pickent Fence to Amazon. All the same answer, ""I cannot believe that we don't carry a replace bag or have a source for a replacement bag""! I absolutely refuse to pay over $200.00 for another vac just to get a new bag. I guess mine will go to the land fill.I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS ITEM!"
1,Beware! Alpha Video has added watermarks!,"Alpha Video is following the lead of other public domain distributors and has added watermarks to this movie. This is unacceptable to me. I pay for a theatrical movie and I don't want watermarkes in the film. I will not be purchasing 2009 Alpha products until the watermarks are discontinued. The video transfer of this film is very good, by the way. Who cares, the watermarks ruin the movie for me."
4,Unconditional Love,"Great new CD by Peabo Bryson. His voice is very clear and expressive. My favorite of the songs is ""Somebody in your life"". He really hits a great mix with that one. Most of the other numbers are good too, especially ""My heart belongs to you"""
5,nobody does it like peabo,"i just love mr. bryson. can't get enough of him. unconditional love is high on my list. he out did himself.when will he be in the l.a., long beach, or orange county area?"
2,Breyer's beginners set for young horse lovers,"SOMEHOW MY OVERALL STARS ONLY SHOWED TWO. I RATE IT AT A 4 OVERALL. THIS IS NOT AN EDUCATIONAL TOY AND I GUESS THAT BROUGHT THE AVERAGE OVERALL LOWER THEN I IT SHOULD BE. THE RATINGS CANNOT BE EDITED. SO I HOPE PEOPLE READ THIS WRITTEN REVIEW. REPEAT - I RATE OVERALL AT 4 STARS.A perfect size and price for the younger horse lover. This set is smaller then he Collectible Breyers, but for her age it was perfect. Priced reasonably. As she gets older she will graduate into the full size Breyer Collectibles at a greater price. But Breyers makes a great, realistic, detailed line and this set delighted her because it was smaller and she could play with it."
4,Good for the price,"Purchased this monitor last year. Noticed that it is not as crystal clear as a CRT, but this is true of all LCD screens. For the price, this model kicks. Check out reviews on computer sites also."
2,"Subset of ""Laughter, The Best Medicine""","When I bought this, I thought that this book was part II of ""Laughter, The Best Medicine."" Imagine my surprise when I found out that this is a slimmed down version of the original. The original (ISBN-13: 978-0762105458) had 366 pages; this one has 272. A sneaky way to sell this book to the buyers of the original book?If you don't have the first book, this is a pretty good book to buy---the jokes are good. But, the original has many more jokes and might be a better buy."
3,Maybe not what you expect,"I bought this book (part II) and found it to be identical to the original hardcover (version I you could call it) I bought several years ago. The book itself is good, but the title with Part II on the cover is misleading."
2,"Four Reasons, Two Stars","There are four reasons to buy this record: Tried and Tested, Put It In Your Heart, Wait No More, and Messenger Wind. Otherwise, Bruce has exercised his right to press too much angry banter, too many monotonous tracks, badly uninspired licks, and shamelessly recycled refrains onto this effort. Some of it is just plain bad, especially the title cut. This from a fan who owns just about every recording the man has ever made. Can we indulge him? If, like me, four superb BC tracks in a sea of crap are enough to tempt you, I categorically promise you won't be disappointed."
2,Disappointed,"Don't get me wrong, I'm a huge Bruce Cockburn fan and this CD has a few great songs on it, but unless you actualy like his long, monotonous dialogues you will be disappointed too. I'm willing to put up with a few of these but they dominate this effort in my opinion...."
3,Poor latch design,"I can't recommend this lunch box. I got it for my 5-year-old daughter for Christmas, and the plastic latch broke the very first time we tried to open it! She was so excited to receive it, then it broke! I felt terrible! The design of the latch is poor; those who manufacture this product must never have tested it with children. Bottom line: Don't waste your money on this plastic lunch box. Look for a more durable soft-sided one with a zipper!"
4,Fast and nice.,"The book is still looks very new even it is not really ""new"". It is tight and clean which is good."
2,Interesting but hard to read,"Ms. Jaffrey has chronicled her search for information about the hijras of India. Her English and grammar is tortured and takes some getting used to. If you've ever actually been to India, you'll be reminded of how you rarely really understand all that people are saying even though it seems to be English. As an American English speaker, reading this book, there were times when I had no idea what she meant.There is also some information about the hijras, but it is repeated to the reader as often as it was repeated to the writer in her search. Mostly what you get from this book is a good sense of what it's like to try to research something in India: the complexities, the subterfuges, the lying, the mix of fact and fiction."
4,It's only rock 'n' roll,"Three successful musicians are brought together to perform at an exclusive hundred thou a ticket fundraiser. The day of this event is also the day that Maxwell Sicily, disowned son of a mob boss, has chosen to pull off a caper sure to make him a rich man.Interspersed with the concert-day activity are the stories of each musician's rise to fame. There's the British rocker Kris Phoenix, the American soul singer Bobby Mondella, and the jazzy songstress Rafealla. Their biographies made for interesting reading, but sadly the Big Event wasn't nearly as compelling to read about. Frankly, it verged on boring. Still and all, the good stuff makes it worth one's while. At least I think so."
1,Not my idea of a good time,"I found Lewellen to be very wordy and dry. I read the book for Contemporary Anthropological Theory at my university and had to write a 15 page paper on it. I had to read the book twice in order to absorb any of it. I have taken four years of anthropology classes and still find the book to be way above my head. This is not a book to read for pleasure. If not in the garbage, it belongs in the classroom with extreme outlining of it, for Lewellen tends to be jumpy and almost scattered. I would not recommend this book to anyone."
5,The Last of the Great Railroads,"Mr. Bramson has taken his long out of print history of the Florida East Coast Railway and updated it. ""New and Improved"" tend to be overused adjectives, but in this case they are totally accurate and well deserved.Mr. Bramson is the corporate historian for the FEC, and it's totally apparent in this work that he truly LOVES the railroad and it's people. The FEC is the railroad other railroads go to when they encounter problems because, in most cases, the FEC has ""Been there, done that"".In an age where railroad mergers have become commonplace, it's great to see one of the nation's finest railroads remaining independent."
2,pace counter,I personally feel that this product is not very effective. The clock on the product works great but i took it on 4 different runs on a course where i knew the distance and thsi product failed miserably. The distance count was off anywhere beween .35 and 1.05 miles on every run. I do not reccommend this product as anything more than a watch.
1,High Gear Pe318 Pedometer,This was not a good Pedometer. It worked for two weeks and stopped working. I would not recommend you to purchase this product. Pay a little more and get a better pedometer. Very disappointed.
2,Disappointed,"I bought the book before Mr Cook's review came out. I just finished it and my thoughts are similar to his.I was disappointed. The book covers a long span of time and I thought it lacked too many details of the inner workings of Formula 1, both from a technical and people/team chemistry point of view. He spent many pages on the Prost/Senna era and gave alot of inside details on the relations between the two. I wish the rest of the book was more of the same. I get the impression that he was either protecting people, particularly in the recent era, or else he was constrained by the publisher as to how many pages the book had to be.I read John Horsman's "" Racing in the Rain"", a similar racing biography and chronology of the Ford GT and Porsche sports car era of the 60s and 70s earlier this year, and that book was miles ahead of this one. I couldn't put it down, while Ramirez' would sit for days between readings."
4,Good children's book,"Polacco writes from her own past. While the trials and tribulations of growing up with divorced parents are presented realistically in Polacco's books, she is able to keep an upbeat perspective. Her relationship with her father shines through in this story. This book definitely tells the story of a very differnet birthday. Simple times can still have exciting experiences. This is a good way for children to be immersed in childhood from years past. Check out My Ol' Man for another wonderful, touching book by this author."
3,american porn,"pbs documentary from the frontline series describing the business of porn connected to major american business ie. gm, comcast and at&t. uncut version probably the most daring doc. ever on pbs"
4,A Love Story Worth Reading,"I am over 12, actually 35 but can't find the review page for adults. Shadow Dancing is first rate. I sat down and read it from cover to cover. Couldn't stop reading. It's a beautiful love story, challenging and well written. The characters are well defined and I cared about them deeply to the point where I shed a tear or two."
2,works... sometimes,"I bought this and it was cool for awhile, but then suddenly it started making a really high pitched buzz in the earphones and i need to take the battery out to make it stop. Also, it will randomly shut off for no apparent reason.not worth the money."
5,Buy it from the band,"If you're interested in checking out STS9 live, this CD is a great place to start. And though it's unavailable here on Amazon, it's not hard to find elsewhere--and well worth the effort (check the band's web site). Jazzy. Spacy. Vibrant. Infectious. Highly recommended."
5,What a neat way to start your day!,"A day just isn't complete without practicing yoga with Yolanda. After trying many DVDs, this is my absolute favorite."
4,When Cocteau Twins meets Tiamat,"This group came from Croatia, I suppose. They sounds more like Dead Can Dance or Cocteau Twins then Black Metal. Sometimes you almost heard Liz Fraser voice and sometimes it's Lisa Gerrard :) Many unusual instruments, ethnic influences, long songs. Interesting. It's definitely not a masterpiece, yes. There is not enough harmony and style in their music, songs not well structured and breaks apart sometimes. But from the middle of this disk I start really enjoy the sound. Best tracks are 5 and 6. But best of all - very good recording quality, much better then average Black/Doom/Death release. Recommended if you like DCD and Metallica and have no problem to mix it."
3,what is a childrens book,"If you are thinking about writing a childrens book, this is a good resource. Looking at what a childrens book is, how to develop ideas, and how to sell the completed work."
4,Good toy for this price,I bought this set for my two years son. For this price it very qualitative and various. We like to play with it.
2,This was a hyped up book,"I thought this book was very bad. it was too short, and incredibly pointless. I heard it was good, but it is not, it is very bad."
4,sweet looking gun,"cool gun, very customizable, really cool looking, but malfunctions occasionally. Although its barell is very short, it shoots very accurately, but is one of the heavier guns out there."
1,surprisingly dull,"Feels good in my hand, but is surprisingly dull! Very disappointing for a JA Henckels product."
2,"A dark, claustrophobic book","My book group loved it. I was the sole exception. I did not love it. I found it a dark, claustrophic book. Perhaps that was intentional on the author's part - all those big trees blocking out the sun and all. I will admit that the American pioneers hold little faciniation for me, which undoubtedly skews my opinion. I understand that in them there days people probably ""reckoned"" all kinds of things. I don't think today's prose describing the past needs to be full of idiomatic accents. I reckoned that was distracting more than anything else. So we have a dark dark book full of reckoning AND it is episodic to boot. Episodic, while occassionally an effective liturary devise, can also strike one as a method to use in stringing together vingettes and never fully realizing the characters' depth. So, now I am left with a dark, claustrophobic, episodic novel full of pretentious accents. I know others love this book. It did not work for me"
1,I Couldn't Believe The Reviewers Had Read The Same Book,"Based on this novel, Dillard's reputation as an American literary icon is vastly overblown. While her descriptions of landscape and historical setting are good, the characters are laughable and, Annie, where's the plot? Almost no forward momentum to keep anyone living interested.I wouln't reccomend this book to anyone and I hope Ms. Dillard stays on the wrong side of the Mississippi River and never again writes about anything I would remotely be interested in."
3,Waste of $,This one is a 'you get what you pay for.' It's not very good. My uncle and I both have different models that are better. Spend the extra $10 or so.
3,"Some stones good, some not so good","I got these to use in diamond earring jackets. The price is very good. I looked at trying to get these separately and found buying them that way was cost prohibitive. So I found these. I need real gold for my sensitive ears, and the 10K gold does the job without the extra expensive and fragile nature of 14K. But some of the stones are so pale that they all look alike. Even with that happening, it is probably a good deal to buy these for the other colors, which look great in my earring jackets. But some, like the aquamarine, was impossible to distinquish from some of the other pale stones that were also almost colorless. I gave it three stars because that is about the percentage of earrings that I would be using. The others will be be set aside to use if I lose my diamonds and feel like a pale imitation."
4,An excellent buy,This shirt is made to fit well. It took almost no time to receive. I reccomend this shirt to all Guiness drinkers and football fans.
4,it was better than spirit of 69,"I enjoyed this one alot more than the previous George Marshall fare. Although that's probably because I am biased and this book touches more on the American skinheads than our British counterparts, this one is just more interesting. It's more stories, more entertaining, and of course, great pictures. None of that silly fashion index nonsense, and it doesn't read like instructions."
3,Wow.,"Troubled Water has one scene which will test the very limitation of your soul. While the film is about ""redemption"" and ""return"" , it somewhere loses it's flow half way through it where the outcomes of certain events surprise you. The acting is superb but towards the end the overall film seems to reduce gears and the film is unable to convey it's sesnation.This film has a piano scene which is so shocking, it rivals the scene from The Pianist where the protagonist plays in the end. Strongly recommended."
4,"Intelligent, vivid","A story that makes you think. Characters that make you feel. Opinions will be formed in later conversations based on the plausibility of this book. I thoroughly enjoyed it. There were no valleys, it skipped from peak to peak. Alex Slanski, Anna Khorev, these are names I will remember even after cracking countless other novels. Thanks, Glenn, it was fun."
5,Gripping & Informative,Soviet history buffs will appreciate the detail. You easily suspend disbelief. Cleverly adds human interest. Well balanced thriller: I read it cover-to-cover on a long journey. On arrival I bought another Meade novel.
4,Better than most,"I liked it but there were flaws. The biggest was when the ""hit team"" didn't search the bodies of the men who attempted to kill them. Consequently the cat was out of the bag. The author should of come up with some other way to tip off the target. Again, this being the most world-shaking mission ever undertaken, it seems to me that each member evolved in the mission would have been assigned a group of undercover bodyguards to watch their back and to protect. And there was a few more. Other than that is was good! Allot better than most, that's for sure."
2,So-so,"This movie has an intriguing plot. But the script was very weak. What I liked the most was when Victor made the decision to save Adrianna, even though it would cost him his life. But if you are a die-hard fan of Maria Conchita Alonso, add this to your collection, but don't forget to see her in ""Caught""."
3,It's OK,"I got this one in a hurry, leaving for a trip to a very dry part of South America and I got stuck with it for the trip. It moisturizes pretty well and is very good for carrying in the pocket. The sleek design makes it pretty. However I am disapponted with the content because it has a sweet taste and a very strong artificial flavour, which I can't get used to feeling in my mouth. It's bearable but not enjoyable."
5,An Admirer of Mike Royko From Albuquerque,"I had always followed Mike's column in the newspaper and this compilation of some of his articles lifted my spirits and made me laugh. Mike Royko, wherever you are, you will always be my hero. Mr. Royko ranks up there with another great satirist, Mark Twain. He is to Chicago what Mark Twain was to the Missippi region. Like Twain, he had the gift of aiming the spotlight on bigotry, petty self-righteousness, stupidity, greed, and a host of other of the human animal's less attractive attributes in such a way as to make many of us roll with laughter and really think. I am afraid that there will not be another one like him. The nineteenth century had Twain. The twentieth century had Mike Royko. Where in this present century will we find someone who can speak for the little person so persuasively and as fearlessly as he did? Or to stand up to the ""system"" as doggedly and with so much humor?"
2,I want to be like Mike,"If you have ever enjoyed a column written by Mike Royko you will love this book. If you have never read a column by Mike Royko then you have the opportunity to experience the joy of seeing the last third of the twentieth century America through his unique view as well as the pleasure of watching an artist at work. With no apologies to Mr. Jordan, Royko is the most talentd Mike to ever work in Chicago."
4,A stellar collection of reviews by our finest columnist.,"As a native Chicagoan, I'm probably predisposed to Mike Royko's no-b.s., cut-to-the-chase style. But I won't let that stop me from recommending his book to any American, or any human being with an interest in print journalism. This meticulously selected collection of columns manages to encompass the essential Royko in just 275 pages, from his ardent belief in the Civil Rights Movement to his inexplicable love of the Cubs (I'm a White Sox fan myself, not that that's much better these days). My only complaint is with the dearth of columns responding to reader letters and phone calls. While ""One More Time"" only includes one, it was in these (generally monthly) columns that Royko really unleashed his razor-sharp, inarguably blunt wit and conscience. But that's that most minor of objections. Any budding journalist or big-city dweller will love this book."
2,Quite different PAIR of games.,"I bought this game set for my son. He is 8. He found one game, Incredibles, very violent and lots of punching and shooting. He got into it for about 5 minutes and then put in another more challenging game that actually used a brain cell to work. Next the NEMO game was very dissapointing. He barely touched it because it was so childish (he said so). Should these two games be packaged together? Anyway, it is our first Gameboy product and it was not as exciting as we expected it to be overall."
2,Earthlink toy,"I purchased this mailstation for my 80 year old mother to introduce her to e-mail. She immediately loved it (much to my surprise as I never expected her to try it). The only problem is that the mailstation truncates messages that are more than 5 or 6 lines long. For some reason, mail sent to the same e-mail address goes through most of the time, but bounces back at other times. Also, mail sent from a hotmail account to the mailstation will not ever go through. The mailstation is so limited that it becomes frustrating. But, for a child or someone who will not ever want to do more than a simple message, the mailstation is a very economical alternative."
5,Works well,Very useful. It carges the camera and a extra battery at the same time. You can conncect the A/V cable and watch it on you TV while charging your batteries at the same time.
4,DAMNATION LIVES ON AGAIN/ CLEVELAND ROCKS,"I WAS PLEASANTLY SURPRISED TO SEE THE DAMNATION OF ADAM BLESSING MUSIC AVAILABLE IN CD FORMAT. GROWING UP IN CLEVELAND,I SAW THEM PLAY LIVE AT THE CYRUS ERIE CLUB. THEY WERE POLISHED,HAD GREAT HARMONIES, AND INCLUDED THEIR HIT ""BACK TO THE RIVER""FROM THEIR SECOND LP. I OWNED SECOND DAMNATION AND IT WAS A GREAT RECORD. I WOULD PUT THEM ON PAR WITH THE JAMES GANG AND JOE WALSH, CLEVELANDS' BEST BANDS OF THE EARLY SEVENTIES.THIS BOX SET IS A TRUE SALVATION, PUN INTENDED."
2,All about Astrology,"We have been looking for a tasteful, modern alternative to traditional religious ceremonies - something that would express our joy about being together, yet still be palatable to our families. This is NOT such a guide. This book is all about astrology.Would you like to know the most auspicious date and place on earth for your wedding? Then you need astrocartography, and to consult an astrologer for your wedding date, as the author did.Other books have better coverage of wedding traditions around the globe, but this book is a rich source of wedding SUPERSTITIONS. Did you know that in ancient England, it was considered bad luck to marry on a Saturday?The book was nothing like what I expected from the blurbs on Amazon. If you are trying to plan a beautiful and modern wedding ceremony, I recommend Weddings from the Heart by Daphne Rose Kingma."
2,Mother Gone Bad Gets Remixed,"This book is basically a rehash of Mother Gone Bad by the same author. Here he expands on the groundwork previously laid in his first book and spicing things up a bit using ""new"" information especially such derived from the parents' book Death Of Innocence. As it is, I lost track of the author's line of reasoning, as he did not really substanciate how the ""hidden meaning"" emerges from what has been written.It makes for an interesting read but if you want information on the case that is more believable and understandable I recommend that you read some of the other books written on this subject, especially Perfect Murder Perfect Town and Steven Thomas's JonBenet: Inside The Ramsey Murder Investigation."
1,There is no description in the description space,"I would like to actually know how detailed it is. This description sucks, and for that amount of money, the company should bother putting in a detailed description about their product."
3,A trip down memory lane,"It's sort of odd to see an album from Japan with songs that form part of the soundtrack of U.S. pop music in the late '50s/early '60s, but that's what you get. Sail Along Silv'ry Moon and other instrumental songs that got plenty of air time are here in what sound like original arrangements. If you remember Billy Vaughn's hits, you'll like this CD."
3,Enough with the Self Acclaim,"As a Dub living in the U.S. i bought this book for a little nostalgia. Its and interesting insight into the inner city Dublin when times were hard. But i find the constant third person patting on the back to be very off putting. I get the impression from this book that Bill Cullen loves himself. Every page seems to have someone stating how amazing the young Liam is including the Lord Mayor of Dublin on numerous occasions. Congrats on making a lot of money Bill but its not like you cured cancer, get over yourself and act like you remember where you came from rather than just writing a book about it."
3,A UNIQUE CELEBRATION!,"I came to this book thinking it was another Angela's Ashes because reviewers have put it there. Well, it is not, it is better. This book is a celebration of life, not a thrashing of it. The author is not using the book as a kind of therapy to vend this anger; instead we are treated to a wonderful world of love and affection and yes, deprivation. They are poor but they don't sit and around and complain and then look back in anger. They cope and in coping the children learn how to be responsible adults.The affection and love that the family members have for each is so moving to read about. This book celebrates the family, celebrates people and celebrates life. The loss of a child is deeply felt but so also is the arrival of a new life.However, having said that the book drags a bit and the author seems very bent on putting his 'genius' forward. The early part is better than the second half."
5,Thank God It's not Angela's Ashes!,"If I wanted to read another depressing Irish Childhood story, I'd have re-read Angela's Ashes! (Not to diaparage Angela's Ashes in any way.) I completely enjoyed the story of Liam's family, his upbringing and the hard work necessary to survive in Ireland in those times. I especially enjoyed Mother Darcy. Whether she actually knew Aloyisius Hitler or not isn't the point, it's all in the storytelling.To compare Penny Apples to Angela's Ashes is the old ""Apples to Oranges."" (Sorry about the pun!) Appreciate the story on it's own merits."
1,First alert customer dissatisfaction,"I purchased the first alert 2.4 ghz black & white wireless camera survellence system, bought an extra camera. Please save your money, they say it has nightvision, all I see is the night! It's so picky with the antennas that it reminded me of rabbit ears on a t.v. and there are lines that go throughout the screen, it's not clear. It does ok, in daylight but forget nite time. It isn't weather resistent either, I bought mine through HSN and they wouldnt take it back because it was past 60days, I bought it in winter and didn't try it out right away."
5,My boys have a ball watching these with me,"If you can't be 8 years old anymore(and I don't think I would want to be), then this set along with others out there can let you be for a little while. I grew up watching these whacked out monsters play their music and tell corny jokes . This set of the series was great fun to watch again, and the side benefit is my young boys have fallen in love with the gang of ghouls from ""Horrible Hall"" just like I did all those years ago.One extra for you older fans is that the humor does have an adult edge that is lost on children and makes it fun for us."
4,Great Cover,"I use contact paper to cover boxes, This way, with one pattern, I can tell all the Christmas stuff. This paticular pattern looks better in the picture."
5,OH MY GOSH ! !,"this cloe doll is all the rage.i am taking her on my upcomingvacation. yes i know it is kind ofweird for an 11 year old to play with dollsbut, this cloe is so cool!i am a spoiled brat and get everything i want.that is why i have A TON of bratz dolls.this cloe i got yesterday at target and she is so cool.she is one of my favorite. she even has her ears peirced.and all of you moms out there, DON'T GET YOUR LITTLE6 YEAR OLD KID A BRATZ DOLL! and this bratz doll is sooo fabulicios! i recomend any bratz doll to 7 and up!"
3,I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS!!!!!!!!,"I am enraged!.I've got many of the Bratz dolls, and so does my little sister. We love our dolls, but when tragedy struck(in our opinion) and my sister's yasmin broke, we were both devastated. We went on line and tried to find a match, but she had the origional doll, and none of these new dolls look anything like the origionals.The makeup is harsh, and unnatural, The hair is thinner, shorter, and on some, a weird texture. Not all are a dissapointment, but most are.My sister finnaly chose the Funk N Glow yasmin, and she cried when she saw how it looked in comparison to the broken doll. The company has got to get their act together and start making dolls that look like the origionals more."
1,NO!!!,"The Bratz DID kill Katlyn Moris!! she was my BEST FRIEND and now she's gone all because of the BRATZ!!!!!!! THEY KILLED HER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! THEY MADE HER WEAR SASSY CLOTHES, FOR GODS SAKES!!!!!!Janna"
4,Bratz Funk Out! Cloe,"Well, i don't like Funk out! as much as the other lines of dolls but i think this one is pretty cool and its worth the price. I just love her pants! So cute! If you want REALLY cool Bratz, heres a list of my fave dolls:-Tokyo a-go-go Jade-Tokyo a-go-go Sasha-Wild life Cloe-Wild life Nevra-Flash back fever Jade-Flash back fever Fianna-Flash back fever SashaThats pretty much all i can name cause i just started likin' Bratz. They are great dolls and i hope you enjoy them!!PS- My Scene sucks!!"
3,my scene do not suck!!!,whoever said that my scene suck is whackted in the head!!! i like bratz alot because they are really pretty and if your bored you can go and play with bratz or my scene and you can make up your own world ant way you want to!!
1,NOOOOOOOOOOOOO!,That person was pretending to be ME! BRATZ KILLED Katlyn Moris! Its a sad tale but its true! beleive me!Janna
1,No ADA Logo - No Manufacturing Country Indicated,"I am concerned that the toothpaste containers do not have the ADA logo on them that the majority of toothpastes' do. Also, there is no indiction of what country manufactured this toothpaste, only that it was ""distributed"". I do not appreciate putting anything into my mouth or body unless I know where is was made."
3,Confusing but interesting story,"I wasn't sure what to think after reading ""The Fall of Rome"". It gives a wonderful detail look of life inside a boy's boarding school and how it tries to bring all forms of social classes into a more intellectual society. But I could not understand the relationship between the Classic teacher and the new African-American freshman. If anything it was more the English teacher who helped the confused lad with terms regarding his brother's death and understanding his new surroundings."
4,"Fun, but does not take long.","This game is a lot of fun when you're playing, but it doesn't last long; it barely took me a week to finish it. After you've finished, there's really nothing else to do.Anyways- it's easy to care for the animal once you have it in the office. Sometimes it's hard to buy enough food and space, you run out of money.Overall, its a fun gaming experience."
2,Not a pocket dictionary,"Just as a warning for persons purchasing a ""pocket"" dictionary for travel.This is not a dictionary that would fit into a ""pocket"" unless you had a backpack.It is 7 inches high, 4 inches long and 1.5 inches thick. It may not be a full size dictionary but this was too large to be kind of dictionary that I need to travel with me in my pocket.Other than the size, it appears to be a good product."
5,Delicious!,"I am saddened to see such a low mark given to such great product. I have bought pack of 24 twice now, and still love it! It is simply delicious especially with mayo. You might say everything tastes good with mayo. All I can say to that is: so?"
2,Good enough,"This dvd has all I need to enjoy a concert. Good sound, not too long, good songs list and spiritually charged. The Greg X. Boltz appearance was so good. Bye bye Petra, I followed you since 1987, I rejoiced with all your albums (even the place I live, because I'm from Guatemala City) specially Beyond Belief, unseen power, no doubt and many more. God bless you everywhere you go. Your ministry was incredible!!!"
4,Good but video edit lets it down,"Great concert. Only a stereo mix but it sounds great. Would have been nice to have had keyboard for the whole concert rather than just for 1 or 2 tracks. Video editing was pretty lame. Tried to do too much, fading, shaking of camera, zooming in ultra close, fast chopping between shots... Needed to be a little less jumpy. Focus is mainly on vocals the whole time when the band are good enough to warrant a bit of coverage. But thats all I can fault it on. Great sound, great concert - could have been a bit longer though, only an hour or so of actual concert here. If you like Petra's music I doubt you will be dissapointed here."
5,Captiving Photo Book,"If you have lived in Miami or have an affinity toward Miami, this is a must-have book. Few people in Miami like Arva Moore Parks have taken the time to document the City's rich history as the fastest-growing metropolis in the United States over the last 100 years. The ""then and now"" photos offer splendid matches, with interesting and informative historical notes in the caption. Great coffee-table book too!"
2,The Book of Art for Young People,"No pictures, not even the one shown in the look inside pages. From a historic stand point this book may be worth reading."
2,no pictures!!!!!!!!!,"how can you have an art book with no pictures of the art???? i guess that you could read it for the history, but still..."
4,"Almost, not quite","One could be daunted by the size of ""Dreadnaught"" but having finished it, I must say that overall it is an excellent book that doesn't quite measure up to its intentions or the hype. Massie is superb in his biographical sketches and he gets the general thrust and parry of Great Power politics. Where he comes up short is that the reader is lured into the notion that the Naval Arms race was what really lit the fuse to WWI. The truth is, of course, more complex. He doesn't bring out the inter-relationships among the Russo-Japanese War, the annexation of Bosnia/Herzegovina, and the amoral oneupsmanship of the Great Power leaders and diplomats. He doesn't provide the perspective between the importance of the arms competition on land and that at sea. All that aside, I would recommend this book because it covers a large subject and a large time frame and still tells the story well."
5,Unputdownable!,"Everyone has their favorite writers, I suppose, and Massie is one of mine. He is ontologically incapable of writing a dull sentence. His narrative propulsion over a thousand pages never flags or fails (to steal a line from one of the historical characters we meet in these pages); the energy, the verve and the drama are just as palpable on Massie's final page as on his first. The set pieces are magnificent, the conflict and drama in the run up to WWI are brilliantly evoked, and as always the biographical portraits are vivid and irresistable---Jackie Fischer, Churchill, and the infantile Kaiser being just three that stand out. I have long suspected that as long as the art of narrative is esteemed, the works of Robert Massie will be read and re-read for the sheer joy and pleasure of the experience."
5,Fascinating,"Andrew Chaiken has proven himself as America's premier space historian with this great work. The basis for the HBO Miniseries ""From the Earth to the Moon"".This book is the culmination of hundreds of hours or interviews with those involved in America's space efforts and even more time doing his own research. The end result is a fascinationg book that gives the reader an insider's feel to the space race.I reccommend this book to anyone with strong interest in the NASA Apollo project. This is truly a classic book and an integral part of any literary collection."
4,"Complete, Accurate, and Compelling","I worked in Mission Control during several Apollo missions including Apollo 11. I was concerned with the performance of the ground tracking network. My focus was not on what was said or done on the moon but on whether or not we maintained communications. As a result I missed a great deal of the details of what transpired. This book more than restores that deficit. It provides clear, well-written descriptions of each lunar mission, as well as, compelling insights into the characters of the Apollo crews. This is good stuff!"
4,The Difinitive Work On The Apollo Era,"I'll economize on words here: if you are interested in the Apollo era, GET THIS BOOK. You will not be disappointed."
2,Don't be fooled!,"I bought this cd for five dollars and that was about how much it was worth! The songs are NOT performed by the original artists, rather by some cheaply recorded fill in. The cd is also strange because it combines traditional romantic love songs with songs about a parent's love for their child, etc."
3,Good serviceable dictionary,There's not a whole lot to say about a dictionary of this type but I've carried this along with me for quite a few years and have always found it useful. I like that it's compact since I don't need a desk type Latin dictionary. I would like to see a section on Latin terms and phrases used in English included but it's easy enough to look up the words. A real help for studying other Romance languages.
3,I am wondering whether ........,"is this the same Havelock that once had a courts case vs. Clifford S. Heinz, the famed Heinz ketchup descendant? I would like to find out very much."
1,A self-serving apologia,"This book is really about the election of 2000, with a thinly veiled, ""That election was controversial, but OK, and so was 2000"" subtext. ""(Supreme Court Justice) Joe Bradley was OK, and so I am, too.""Rehnquist is obviously campaigning for his place in history, just like the President (Nixon) who appointed him did for the last 20 years of his life."
5,Continuation on Fish Called Wanda,"If you loved ""A Fish Called Wanda"" you will love this movie. So incredibly funny I laugh so hard even though I've seen it over a dozen times. All the characters mesh so well and the story line is beyond hilarious. It's on my ""must have"" list."
3,"Reunification of the comedy stars of ""A Fish Called Wanda"" missed its potential","Imagine the two Python writer/stars re-teaming with comedy actors Kevin Kline and Jamie Lee Curtis; imagine a premise whereby Kline & Curtis interrupt and try to take over Cleese & Palin's tug-of-war over converting a regular zoo into one featuring only ferocious animals. Truthfully, with more slapstick and mugging from the Pythons, this could have been a really funny film. The result, however, is only somewhat funny. Kline, as usual, has the Midas touch with every film I've seen him in. That's what made ""A Fish Called Wanda"" such a success: his over-the-top style and the other actors' chemistry surrounding him. In this offering, that's all we have. Although funny, ""Fierce Creatures"" is a missed opportunity to catch the Wanda lightning in the proverbial jar. It's definitely worth getting for Python/Kline/Curtis completists, and it's definitely worth having in your comedy film collection -- for under $8.00."
3,funny for John Cleese fans,It's a cute movie. Funny for John Cleese fans. My fiance loves Cleese and Cleese was funny in this movie
3,Not letterboxed,"The service by the seller was first rate but the product was not. Buyers should be aware Fierce Creatures is in the ""pan and scan"" format, not letterboxed and the differences are noticeable. For example, two people are talking but only one is visible and the overall clarity of the video is compromised. It is very irritating."
4,What I expected,"I couldn't find Pez on amazon that had a good variety of the regular flavors (cherry, strawberry, orange, etc).I received all the flavors, but only got 1 lemon. 1 Lemon! that's my favorite flavor too. There was also way too many raspberry, which is the worst flavor. I will probably order this again, hopefully I'll get more lemon next time."
3,Zechariah Sitchin's 'Space Opera',What is it about the tendency of some to belittle the ingenuity of ancient peoples? Were they not in themselves capable of conceiving the great pyramids or inventing cuneiform through their own need to record? I won't dispute that Sitchin is a good read in the sense that the Da Vinci code is. Afterall fantasy is a great form of escapism and we can all indulge ourselves from time to time. However to suggest that space ports may once have existed near some of the world's great ancient remains is stretching it a bit thin!We may very well have been seeded on this world as the author maintains but why have no tangible remnants of such a civilisation ever been found? Anyone can distort the facts to come up with half baked notions as this alleged Sumerian scholar has done but this is not science. Enjoy the book for what it is....an interesting work of fiction but for God's sake don't take it literally. I give it 3 stars for amusing content.
1,Procede with caution,"While this book may be ""enlightening,"" it does not hold up to any scientific, historical, or philological scrutiny. Enjoy it as a work of pure fiction, but do not rely on it as serious scholarship. Consider the reviewer who readily accepted this mysterious, alien-inhabited planet as a proven fact and yet found the suggestion of Abraham as an actual person to be insufferable. If you hold such views, consider reading this book, if not, do not waste your time or money. (The one star was for entertaiment value only, otherwise it deserves zero stars.)"
2,LINDE,An interesting but speculative view of galactic/planetary history. I found it extreamly long winded and tedious reading.
5,Sitchin presents a multitude of intriguing theories,"While many of his suppositions are only loosly documented by evidence, he makes a compelling case for the origins of human civilization in ancient Sumer. This book is at the very least fascinating and thought provoking. The scholarship shown in his linguistic interpretations is first rate, (although his conclusions sometimes gloss over evidenciary inconsistencies). All in all an excellent read"
4,if your a fan then it is good,Wife is enjoying this as she has read a couple of his books before. It iwll make you want to rethink everything you ever learned about the worlds creation
4,Intriguing,"Of all the scientists to come from behind the Iron Curtain, Sitchin is the most fascinating. His ideas reflect the need most Eastern Europeans and Asians have, in my opinion, to attribute greatness to ancestors who may or may not merit such attention.Nevertheless, Sitchin does exhibit brilliance in lateral thinking. He takes information and evidence available and re-interprets it in ways never before considered. His interpretations give us a starting point from which to launch questions against the established dogma of history.History is the target of this book, of that there is no doubt. Sitchin's contention that all history is skewed not just toward the victors but out of time altogether is a marvelous example of a mind ready to change. If you need help finding out why things don't seem quite right when reading about ancient history, this book will prove an invaluable resource."
1,Dishonest,I almost bought this book because it was rated 5 stars. Then I noticed that the only review was by the author who has given herself 5 stars on all her books even though other reviewers give her books only 1 or 2 stars. I'm giving it 1 star to derate the author's overinflated opinion of herself and keep others from being misled. Amazon should not allow author or publisher reviews to skew the rating results.
1,Almost a copy!,"I did not like this book because the EDM section is almost a complete rip-off of E. Bud Guitrau's ""The EDM Handbook"". The paragraphs are in practically the same order and Mr. Guitrau's graphics have just been merely redone. Examine both books side by side and see for yourself. I am surprised Mr. Guitrau or his publisher has not sued the author of this book. It seems the author should stick to writing children's books as that seems to be his strengths"
3,Not up to its usual snuff,"The penguins are always fun. But the introduction of baby characters was a not a great direction to take them in. I prefer the episodes withe Dr. Blowhole, or where they are tackling larger than life dilemmas, but the duckies just didn't inspire the same sense of adventure. So it was OKAY, but not fabulous."
3,My Baby Finds This Boring,"My daughter is 9 months old. I think this DVD is just too serene and calm for her, but maybe she'll gorw into it. Art design is fine on this, but the music tracks could be better. ... I started my baby on Einstein, Mozart and Bach at about 3 months old and she still is capitvated by each of them. I recently showed her Neighborhood Animals which she loves also."
5,It's Barnabas!,"Like the title says, the BEST of Barnabas. 9 episodes, featuring our favorite vampire - along with great cast members. A must have for Dark Shadows fans."
4,This Gould admirer is not clear...,"While Morris has high praise for Woderful Life and for Gould's interpretation of the fossils in general, he seems to have a need to find differences between himself and Prof. Gould. While I am not a professional scientist, I read Gould's book twice and find it exceptionally illuminating (you have to like evolutionary biology). To me, his central thesis regards the role of contingency in evolution. That Pikaia should have survived and been the ancestor of all vertebrates simply could not be predicted. Morris seems to think that if not Pikaia, it would have been something similar. There's a touch of 'inevitable' in his elucidation.Gould believes that any replay would produce wildly differing results from what we now see. Morris doesn't think so.Not a bad read but Gould's book is decidedly better."
3,There's An Ulterior Motive Here,"A disappionting book. Dr. Morris gives a nice overview of the odd little Burgess Shale creatures (gotta love 'em) and brings up some interesting evolutionary questions but does not seem to develop his themes to the full. The shame of the book lies in his vitriolic attacks against Stephen J. Gould (who wrote 'Wonderful Life', also about the Burgess Shale). He seems to think Gould (of all people) wants to pull down the whole theory of evoultion. And the attacks get personal - he goes so far as to practically accuse Gould of being a Marxist! Dr. Morris actually seems to hate Dr. Gould - one wonders if Gould snubbed him at a party once or something. Anyway, all this detracts from the book and makes the author sound mean-spirited and peevish. Too bad, as he does (like Dr. Gould) have some valid points to consider."
2,Close but No Cigar,"Conway Morris has written flawed book which fails to take its best arguments to their logical conclusions. If convergent evolution is so important, as he states, then why does he not apply the concept of convergent evolution to the enigmatic Ediacarans? Instead, he merely restates the worn out proposition that all the Ediacarans are animals. It seems much more likely that the Ediacarans resemble animals because of convergent evolution, but are not in fact animals themselves.His statement that there is evidence of Design, and that we will be held accountable for our actions, is highly provocative in today's scientific climate and yet hardly discussed at all in this book!On the positive side, it is good at last to have what appears to be a reliable family tree for animals."
5,Good Reference,"I have seen in many reviews that people purchased this book for their children. This is probably due to the fact that there are removable items within the pages of this book. These are actually replicas of authentic 17th and 18th century documents, a really bad hand of period playing cards, and a replica of an authentic pirate flag. in regards to these documents they are somewhat difficult to read (due to the fact the printing in these times was not exactly ""good""). Also the fact that this book covers pirate torture techniques and some of there deaths in gruesome detail makes me wonder if young children should be reading that. Anyway, if you want a fun book for the kids pick up ""pirates"" by john Matthews, if you want a good introductory to the ""golden age of piracy"" pick this book"
2,Used Books,"I was a bit disappointed in this book, it has some good points to it but it is aimed at more of a juvinile audiance;I read it in a couple of hours. It's a good introduction but that's about it. If you really want to know about ""pirates"" read ""Under the Black Flag"" by David Cordingly or ""Villains of All Nations"" by Marcus Rediker. Both are excellent books."
2,"Great idea, poor quality...","I purchased one of these nifty gadgets for my husband, who has trouble with arthritis. We were so intrigued that we immediately ordered a second as a gift. The first one opened about 18 bottles before its innards were sprung. No longer anxious to give the other as a gift, we kept it, hoping that the first one was just a dud. The second one is not dead yet, but it doesn't have long.It feels hefty and solid in the hand, but the little-bitty wire spring inside is flimsy. Not one of my best purchases from amazon.com and I wouldn't recommend this product if you expect it to last through more than a case of brew."
3,"Great idea, not the highest quality","Worked great for about 9 months, then broke. Glued it back together, then shattered. Might be the rate at which it was used though.... my family might drink a good bit."
4,Some of the best industrial music I've ever heard.,"This is an incredibly intense, VERY creative album. Amazing industrial music. The lyrics are quite Christian though.. this is a Christian band/project, in case you are wondering.This is a concept album. That means each song is part of a story. The plot is dark sci-fi, which fits the music. Concept albums can be tough to do right. I think Under Midnight did well with this.If the lyrics were not Christian, I'd give the album five stars. I have no problem with Christians, but since I am not one, I don't care for the lyrics.However, the album is still inspiring. I make industrial music on my computer sometimes, and this album is a big reason why I do."
4,Good book for the novice,"Great book for a new PHP programmer or new to SQL. Great hands on easy to work with examples. But not for a person who already has a handle of the basics. It does scratch the surface of such things as session control, user authentication and personalization, but doesn't get into the nitty gritty. It does have a nice part on generating PDF reports. I stress again great book for a beginner."
2,Don't waste your money,"The more pages that a computer book has the less value it seems to have and this book is no exception. The authors try to cover too many topics and as a result almost nothing is covered adequately. I've had problems making sessions work properly and the chapter on sessions was of absolutely no help. You can find better information on the Internet. To be fair, I did get a couple of ideas from this book that I've used in my web design. The most positive thing that I can say is that I'm very grateful that I got the book from the library rather than buying it."
5,An extremely good tutorial.,"The first thing that caught my attention was that this book had me programming a real-world script, that applied exactly to what I wanted to do, within the first chapter! The tutorial just got better from there. This is a good reference book as well but I wouldn't buy it for that purpose. It really is a tutorial and should be read front to back, as opposed to somewhere in between. In that capacity it is excelent.I had about four months experience teaching myself PERL (a language similar to PHP) before I picked up this book. After only a few days with this book I was easily performing more complex tasks with PHP than I was ever able to do with PERL! Frankly if you're still doing web/database integration in PERL you're living in the Dark Ages."
2,Confusing and Incomplete.,"This book was hard to follow in places and the code included with the book didn't seem to work half the time. Trying the simple examples given on page 506 (Listing 24.4) I spend good part of an 8 hour work day trying all kinds of things to make that simple script to work, but to no avail. I eliminated the if statement, the only code in the example, and it worked. This experience and the haphazard presentation and confusing explanations of the examples that followed I gave up on using the code in this book and found alternative examples elsewhere.On a positive note this book has a good introduction to SQL functions."
5,Awesome,I got this book while my husband was at JRTC. I had a hard time getting through it. The girls love it! My husband read it to them before he deployed and used it to tell them that he'd be away for a while. 100% Get this book!
3,DOESN'T TOAST THE BREAD WELL ENOUGH,"THIS IS A BEAUTIFUL-LOOKING PANINI MAKER. THE NON-STICK SURFACE IS FANTASTIC. I'VE OWNED A GEORGE FOREMAN AND A DENI GRILL BUT THE SURFACE ON BOTH OF THEM STUCK AND WORE OFF, MAKING IT IMPOSSIBLE TO CLEAN. WITH THIS, ALL YOU MUST DO IS WIPE WITH A DAMP PAPER TOWEL.I HAVE FOUND, THOUGH, THAT I MUST TOAST MY BREAD BEFORE MAKING A PANINI SANDWICH, SINCE IT DOES NOT TOAST THE BREAD ADEQUATELY.CHICKEN BREASTS AND STEAK COOK PERFECTLY. HOWEVER, I FIND THAT THE GRILL MARKS ONLY OCCUR ON ONE SIDE IN A DEEP WAY. ON THE OTHER SIDE THE GRILL MARKS APPEAR BUT ONLY LIGHTLY.AS ALWAYS BE CAREFUL WITH STEAK, AS YOU MAY OVERCOOK THEM. THIS MACHINE COOKS HOT.ALL IN ALL, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE PRE-TOASTING OF BREAD, I FIND THIS MACHINE TO BE REALLY WORTH THE MONEY, ESPECIALLY SINCE I SAVED $30 BY BUYING IT BY APPLYING AND USING A NEW AMAZON CREDIT CARD(I GOT IT FOR $30)."
1,DO NOT BUY!,This is way too big for any infant. It does not even fit my 11 month year old son. POOR QUALITY!!!! the fabric tears very easily and is not designed for any baby.
5,review of life,Richard Foster is so good about bringing his experiences to you and help you think of your life in relation to God. Almost every sentence gives one something to meditate upon.
3,and the other half?,"Chih-p'ing Chou has developed some of the best language textbooks available for Chinese students. However, amazon only shipped me the language and grammar notes for this series. Without the essays, it is a study in vocabulary. Call them before you buy this, or any two part series to be sure you are getting what you need. (5 stars for Chou, -2 for bad advertizing at amazon)"
5,First rate choices for reprint anthology,This collection of DC crossovers has something for every collector. Particularly of note is the first pairing of the golden age and silver age Flash. That story began the Parellel Earth concept that became a linchpin of DC continuity until 1986. The genisis of the Teen Titans from Brave and The Bold #54 also appears. I highly recommend it.
5,"Great sound, even in the beginning","I was anxious to get this CD added to my collection, simply because it was his first release as a true country music artist. I really wanted to see how he sounded in the beginning, compared to how he was on later CDs. Frankly, I think it was obvious on this CD that he was supremely talented and could do very well. This CD has a more traditional country music sound, which I feel suits his voice perfectly. This CD is really a pleasant change from his later work. Good ballads and great two-steppin' music. Kenny Chesney fans would not be disappointed with this CD."
5,A must read for any Mom (or Dad) to be!,"I read this book while expecting my 2nd baby and got so much out of it even then! Dr. Leman has a way with words that it feels like he is speaking the words to you directly! His advice is so practical, his humor is witty, and even if you read this after your first child I can assure you that you will learn something. I highly recommend reading this book to give you the encouragement you need while planning and preparing for your little ""hedonistic"" bundle of joy!"
2,Too much bad advice outweighs the good advice,"You'll be much better off with The Baby Book by Sears and Sears.This book has some dangerous advice about breastfeeding that goes against the AAP's new guidelines. And, Leman offers a cookie-cutter approach that is not good for all families.The Baby Book is a fabulous investment by parents of eight, who also happen to be a pediatrician and lactation consultant/R.N. Buy that book instead."
5,A great approach...a must read,"This is the first book I've bought while pregnant except for What to Expect When You're Expecting. The approach the author uses here is simple and laid back. Instead of telling you what to do and saying anything different is wrong, he pretty much deals with common sense and the fact that you really can't screw up your child, so stop stressing out about it. He states that all babies, like all pregnancies, are different and unique. Loving your child and bonding is important, yet comes only after bonding with your spouse and keeping your faith strong. I like how he says that too much preparation and worry over what products to use, how to feed, keeping to a schedule, is all unnecessary stress and doing what you feel is right is what is important. It is a great read and easy to follow. I feel a lot better already about bringing my baby into this world knowing I don't have to follow any plan or measure up to any other parent."
4,So far it works well,"So far it works well...a little history. We rented this small house a month ago and it comes with a front and back yards. But within a couple of weeks I discovered that the back yard serves as the neighborhood litter box for cats. One early evening, around dusk. We were taking a stroll down the street when we saw no less than 9 cats sitting on the front lawn near the front door. Yeap, we have the neighborhood cat lady. And I assuming she's feeding them every evening.I really don't hate cats. I just don't want them to use my back yard as their personal latrine. I've read some of the reviews here and found them quite informative. So I bought two of these devices and placed them in areas they like to go. THEY BOTH WORKS....After a few days the cats are going in the one area in the back yard that is not covered. Around the corner on the side of the house where the gas and electric utility meters are. So....I'll order one more. And up-date the results. Saturday, October 27, 2012."
1,Waste of money,"Bought 2, what a joke. A cat walked up to the first one approx 5 foot away. Red light came on. cat just looked at it. Second one a cat actually walked up to it and looked at it, no more than a foot away, red light came on, cat just stared at it. There is 1 hour of my life I will never get back. Product should be removed from shelves everywhere."
3,"The cats get used to it, then you will need to keep moving it around","We have 5 cats at our backyard. They were pets of the previous owners, but they did not take the cats with them when they sold the house and moved out. I purchased 2 catstops, trying to keep them away from the patio. The catstops normally will work for 2 days. Then the cats learned about its locations and still come back to the patio by taking a different route. Now, I need to move the catstops every 3 days to keep the cats away. I wish the catstops are more powerful, that the cats never want to come close it them.... :-("
3,Poorly made.,I odered and received four of these. One stopped working after 24 hrs. A ll are cheaply made and tend to break when inserted into the lawn or flower bed. They have not stopped the cats.Contech CatStop Ultrasonic Outdoor Cat Deterrent
2,My kitten loves it - especially the red light,I bought 2 of these last year and deployed one in the car port to keep my cats off the car. It seems to work if you don't mind replaceing the 9V battery every 3 weeks or so.I placed the second one inside a bedroom door at floor level to keep the kitten out of the baby's room. The kitten loves the unit's sound and light show so much she always checks it out before entering the room.It's a well made unit but performance is poor. Save your money.
3,"It works, just to not far or wide.","The CatStop has help with keeping the street cats out of my yard. The problem is the distance and scope of picking up the cat singal is not that strong. My yard is 24 feet by 24 feet and it only works about 6 feet out and about 2 feet to the left and rigt of the CatStop. Otherwise, I recommend this to anyone."
1,Battery life isn't as claimed,"The thing works just fine, but the device claims to last up to nine months on a single battery. I am currently changing the battery at a rate of once every 7-14 days...My first clue was seeing a cat standing right in front of it and not flinching. Turned out the battery was dead after one week. There was no other 'traffic' coming into the yard and it's out of sight of trees etc."
4,Seems to work,"I purchased a CatStop six months ago to stop local cats from defecating in our yard which had become a daily occurrence. I had tried several other products like repellent powders from the hardware store and didn't have any success. I wasn't expecting the CatStop to work, but it really seems to keep the cats away. After six months of success, I purchased three more. Only reason I didn't rate this five stars is that it takes a few of these devices to really keep the cats out of the yard, and the battery needs to be replaced about every 4-8 weeks depending on how much activity (people using walkways, etc.) there is around the device. It's an expensive solution, but it's nice to not have to clean up after other people's pets anymore. I think the birds and lizards in our yard appreciate it too. :)"
1,Didn't work,"We bought this to deter our cats from jumping on our neighbor's car. It is expensive and, for the price, we figured should work. Didn't work at all. Not only did our cats repeatedly get on the neighbor's car, but they also walked directly in front of this device, setting it off, and were not bothered. None of our cats are deaf, and ALL of them seemed immune. Truly a waste of money. I'm disappointed, because I had high hopes for this device."
3,Defective but got a refund,The product (used) was defective but the seller immediately gave me a refund. The company who makes them promissed a new one. They also have 2 year warranty and offer replacement parts or a kit. Hope it will work
3,An OK product,"This product works OK I suppose, I have found signs of a cat being in my yard but they over in a different place just away from the product. However, the product should have detected the cat and kept it away.The product also will make it's little deterent noise if the wind is blowing, which will run the battery down faster."
2,It worked while it worked,"It worked great when I first installed it in my atrium. The cats were curious about it but severely annoyed, and the area that gets soaked in a week was untouched. Then urine spots started appearing, and I discovered the unit had broken...after one week. This is a device with no moving parts and runs on 9V yet it breaks after a week.A better option, IMO, would be to build one homegrown-style with better quality parts if that's in your skill level, but the concept works like a charm (and this is coming from someone who has tried - to no avail - cayenne pepper and both organic and petrol-based ""barrier"" sprays."
4,Cat Stop WORKS!,"I was skeptical at first, but we installed twoof these in our backyard (urban, phx metro area)no cats...! in fact, we haven't even had toput new batteries in the units, since thecats have been conditioned to stay away(pavolvian respsonse? :-)Recommended, these things *DO* work, no morecat c**p to clean up anymore"
1,CatStop does not Stop!!!,"Bought one of these to keep cats out of my garage, cats looked at it and walked right on in. Followed directions completely, even changed one new battery for another. No change, they walked right on in. WASTE OF MONEY AND TIME."
1,try a live animal cage instead,"this deterrent is a band aid only. Looked at all the options and went for the cage instead. My section of town was crawling with cats a few months ago. A cage in a few weeks took care of 90% of the problem, simple and effective, never needs batteries. If you live next to the ""cat lady"" or the like, the deterrents --and I've tried many, work for about a day. After that the cats alter their routine or get used to them. Why rig up your house trying to place deterrents everywhere, just get rid of the problem. Link to a small cage, might need a bigger one.Havahart Live Animal Single Door Cage Trap for Skunks and Rabbits #1078"
1,Cats still here,"Well, hoping for the best when purchasing this product. It doesn't seem to do anything when cats walk in front of it. I did read in the directions it doesn't work for old cats. It seems that the cats that walk around my house are all old. I should have sent it back but I hate returning things. If they would have had an easier return policy (included a call tag) I would have sent it back. I wish others luck keeping cats away."
5,Terrific,"I have had cats use my flower beds for their potty box every year. I have tried repelants, bamboo sticks that I have stuck in the ground nothing has worked. I bought this to try, it has worked like a charm. I have not had a cat in this bed since I started using it. I was so thrilled I bought a second one for my garden in back."
1,Doesn't Work,Our neighbor's cat keeps spraying our front door so I bought this to try and keep it at bay. It worked for about a month before the cat got used to the sound. Now it walks right past without batting an eyelash and our front door is regularly sprayed again. Don't waste your time on this product.
1,Cats keep a comin,This product did not stop any cats at all. If anything they seemed curious about it. Waste of money.
2,Cat Stop,"This product doesn't stop the cats at all. I actually think I can hear them laughing at it. I have holes dug within inches of this thing, with cat feces.I wouldn't recommend wasting $50 on this item."
1,Quit Working,"We purchased two of these items. Both have stopped working and now the neighbor's cat sits underneath our bird feeders and uses our children's sandbox as a litter box. Last night, the cat left us part of a rodent's body by our back door. The cat stop worked wonderfully for a couple of months so we bought a second one for underneath the bird feeders. Now we're out the $ and don't know what to do so that the cat will stay away."
2,Good while it worked,It was good while it worked. I needed a small area protected in front of my house from cats and this came in handy. No cat poop for 5 months. Then it stopped working and new batteries don't help. I put in a new battery and the device just drains it right away. Went through 5 batteries until it became clear that the thing is malfunctioning. This possibly happened because of the rains but I am not sure.
2,My cats must have noise filters,"This device hasn't stopped them after 2 weeks... they seem to like it. I have moved it a couple of times to provide the best location. So far i have not discovered the ""best"" location."
2,Still See Cats,"Set it up for 1 week, I still see cats wondering around in my yard, not sure if the device is working. Maybe I didn't put it up long enough."
2,Cat has to be directly in front of it.......,"It works if the cat(s) is right in front of it for longer than a second. It doesn't have the range it claims and what range it has is not all inclusive. We've even moved it around trying to give it the best space and reach. Didn't help. I was really hopeful that this would keep the cats off my husbands mustang convertible, but it's just not working."
2,This Does Not Work,"I have a Scarecrow and like it, but it won't work in the winter time. I saw the CatStop units and was hopeful. I bought two units to stop my 3 neighbor cats from sitting under my bird feeder and scaring the birds away. The cats can't actually reach the feeders but their presence disturbs both birds and squirrels and they occasionally manage to catch an unwary bird.I put the units up, a fair distance apart and facing each other, on either side of the feeders. I have since watched all three cats, individually, come to the feeders and sit between the two units without a care. I can see the units activating but the cats completely ignore them.This product does not work, so don't waste you money."
5,This little gizmo is fantastic!,"I've read a lot of negative reviews, how it fills up w/ water in the rain, stops working, etc. I sealed the edges w/ some clear silicone, put some duct tape over the battery compartment and it works all the time! I watched my nemisis, The Cat, nearly jump out of his fur just as he was gettng ready to poop in my garden. It was hilarious! I since purchased another one for my front yard."
3,Mixed but mostly positive,"Given the winter we've had, batteries don't last long, even with the motion detector function. However, I've noticed less evidence of the six feral cats in our neighborhood since I began using this. It's just difficult to say whether it is this or winter keeping them at bay right now. The true test will be this Spring."
1,Pictures are not of the Pharmium Model,"The pictures shown are not of the Pharmium model. I think the pics are of the Kickflip model. I have a pair of Pharmium glasses. Great construction, lasts a long time with good lens quality."
4,Doom 3 OSX 10.5,"Game runs very well on my intel based MacBook Pro. Install the Doom 3 1.3.1 Rev A update (I found it through the Apple web page) before running this game on OSX 10.5. My OS version required me to open Audio MIDI setup, & change the Audio Output from 2ch-24 bit to 2ch-16 bit, otherwise audio would not work.I encountered one freeze up during the early portion of the game, however the remainder of the game ran flawlessly. An immersing game, however a bit short IMHO."
1,Disappointed,"I've played and enjoyed the older versions of Doom on PCs. I was REALLY looking forward to this Apple version. What a disappointment! After loading and opening Doom on an IMac, Mac OS X (version 10.5.8) 2.4 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo Processor w/4 GB 667 MHz DDR2 SDRAM, my screen went black and nothing I could do would cancel it. Short of unplugging the computer, I couldn't shut it off! An Apple rep got it running and after a few minutes of play at home, I realized there was no speech. Finally that was fixed and then, there was a download that was available and after the download I had no speech again. I deleted everything I could find on the computer that pertained to Doom and occasionally look at at the Doom box on my desk in regret. I won't go through the frustration again! Do I need to say I DO NOT recommend DOOM 3!!!"
2,a boring movie,I wasnt impressed with this movie at all.It had a good ending but this movie just doesnt keep you glued to the tv screen..
3,Syliva Woods book on Harp playing,Book is in black and white format. Some colour would have been nice.Spiral binding means it sits on the music stand well without falling shut. More suitable for adults to use than for school students.Useful bracketing on where to place fingers before playing. Print is on the smaller side. Content looks very good indeed. Good low-priced book.
5,it was very interresting and very straight to the point .,I thought that it was a very good book if you like sex and I tried a few of the suggestions on getting to know your lover with my wife and she seemed to enjoy the new me.So that is why I am interrested in futher videos and books.Please give us new material to enjoy!!!!!!!!!!
1,Don't believe what you read on the box!,"This DVD did not contain many of the kinds of sports that it promises, both in the Amazon product description & other places I've seen it available. It's all water sports, and a lot of old/poor quality footage at that. The video on this DVD doesn't even come close to delivering 'Total Insanity 2: The Craziest Sports Moments' as the title promises. Huge waste of money."
3,be careful,looks nice and very durable but I thought it was black and white like most marble would be but it is black and blue. Unfortunately the image is not clear and as is true many times on Amazon the description is not as complete as you might want it to be. Delivery and seller are fine but be careful and customers need to encourage amazon to provide better detail on product descriptions.
3,An average album....,"This is a good album, but if you've listened to their earlier works you would not think of it as highly as if you hadn't. If you want to try some epic london suede purchase ""dog man star"" or ""sci fi"", those two albums will make you fans for life. ""Coming up"" would also be a better purchase than head music. But ""electricity"" and ""she's in fashion"" make this album well worth the buy."
4,Pretty cool,"They finally got rid of their teenage angst songs. I knew they were better than that. I don't mind the electronica turn but wished it rocked more. Seems to have more ballads, but still a good effort from one of the better bands of the 90's. Why aren't these guys more popular in the US?"
2,Empty disappointment,"I eagerly purchased this followup to the tremendous ""Coming Up"", expecting to be blown away by what surely was to be the next step in this band's evolution. Well, it's a step alright. Backwards. Listening to ""Head Music"" makes one feel the way one felt when putting Queen's ""Hot Space"" on for the first time. You heard of a new direction of the band, and were horrified when you found out what it was. This empty collection of electronic noise, supplemented by obtuse lyrics about what else- the London club scene(wow, still on that tack, Brett?) is pointless and fatiguing. It's too bad because Suede is/was a good band. I don't know what they were thinking here, but I hear the recording engineer died of boredom during mixing..."
3,on second thought- an ammended review-,"have to jack up my review from below 2 stars because on further spins it was evident to me that ""asbestos"" just might be one of their best songs ever. Not only that, but some of the melodies have been sticking in my head, like the chorus of electricity. I should know better than to review an album based on a couple of listens. But still, it doesnt move me in the way sci-fi lullabies or dog man star does."
4,a grand debut,"englishmen playing fine american music,even if you buy for the track,s tell it like it is,5th letter and shadow of the man,makes this a well worth purchase with some great harmonies.fans of golden snog,the jayhawks and whiskeytowns strangers almanac will relish."
1,Too Little information,"We are a SolidWorks and Pro/E engineering heavy equipment company located in Ohio. I have a strong Pro/E background with a Mechanical Engineering degree, and I am trying to learn SolidWorks. SolidWorks seems like a great design tool for many applications.I picked up a used copy of this book, ""Introducation to Solid Modeling Using SolidWorks"". I was very disappointed in the lack of functional information in the areas of: general features, creating Drawings, implementing Mates and Relations and generating Assemblies. The book is poorly written and I would not recommend it to anyone, at any level looking to learn SolidWorks. In the last review, it was written, ""Howard deliberately does not explain all the methods in SolidWorks. To minimize information overload on you."" I wish he provided more information and let me be the one to decide on information overload!"
4,good times,i have found it hard to stop watching this video. I also purchased the CD for the sing-along. friends come over and we enjoy watching and singing. it is sooooo goood!
5,A horribly good time,"Joss Whedon and friends are incredibly talented, snarky and in many ways amazing. Commentary! The Musical has a lot of inside jokes, but if you've followed along from the start, you'll get most of them. Or if you know anything about the actors involved and how they signed onto the project, etc. Plus anything with Neil Patrick Harris can't go wrong these days."
5,Just Buy It!!,"Enough has been said about this DVD already! Just buy it!! It is a blast to watch! I originally watched it online and jumped at buying it as soon as it was released! If you are a fan of Joss Whedon, campy musicals, comics, etc. you'll love it! Everyone loves it!"
5,"Joss Whedon does it... to everyone, repeatedly!","Incredibly over the top spoof updating the Mad Doctor genre as a musical for the 21st Century. It would be easy to pass this by because of the title. That would be a mistake. Neil Patrick Harris and Nathon Fillion find themselves pitted against one another over both the Dr's intention to rule the world, and the girl (Felicia Day) who has stolen both of their hearts.As is usual under Joss Whedon's direction, all of the performers fulfill their roles to perfection... while repeatedly breaking into song. Joss' younger brothers, Jed and Zack, even got into the act on this one, being involved with the writing, while Jed and Joss wrote the music. (See, it's not just his actors he does it to over, and over, and over, and over...)If you're a fan of anyone in the film, or of Joss Whedon himself, this is a must-have."
5,Amazing,"One of Joss Whedon's best works. If you love musicals and Neil Patrick Harris and comedy, then this will be something that you will enjoy."
2,Not Quite Horrible...,"...but I don't recommend it either. The first episode, for me, I could have almost completely done without. Only at the very end of that episode did anything seem to click. The 2nd and 3rd were better but I didn't like the way it ended. All-in-all...just not all that funny, though it has its moments."
4,"Original, Witty & Corny in a Good Way","This product is original, witty & corny in a good way. It has some wonderful key moments. The Dr Horrible/Penny/Capt Hammer triangle is interesting to say the least. I was not overly thrilled with the ending. It was just typical of Joss Whedon's one-note style, but other than that it's definitely worth checking out."
5,Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog,The video is worth it for the extras alone. Commentary the musical is funny enough on its own but the applications to the evil league of evil left me in stiches. It's a must own for fans of Joss.
4,"Fun, but overpriced","It is fun, and the songs really get into your head. However, it is only 45 minutes, so it is really overpriced."
1,DVD-R Are you kidding me Whedon?,"So, I have a tshirt that says Josh Whedon is my master now.I'm going to have to think hard about wearing it again.I love Dr.Horrible, but releasing this as a DVD-R recorded item is terrible ( not horrible )I don't want to have something that looks like a pirated copy and if I want a DVD-R version I'll do it myself.Honestly Josh, I expected better from you.The material is great - format sucks.I can't fathom why you would go back to FOX except that you need a paycheck. Please don't sell out."
1,Cards,All of the cards were stuck together. The odds of getting something good in the box is 1 in 7 backs. It came on time.
4,Beautfiul,This necklace is so pretty. I love how close to the neck it sits. The pink is just as you see it - soft and girly. Love this item!
5,Warren Miller's new film,It is the best yet everyyear they seem to come out with another film and each year i can't believe it is still better then their last one
3,Little disappointing,"First off I am a huge Warren Miller fan. It is normally the best way to kick start your winter with the annual Warren Miller Movie. However Wintervention left me wanting more. The film had a cheesy (more then usual) feel, sloppy production, interesting soundtrack selection, poor sound...etc. The footage is still good, and the locations are great. Overall it was a bit disappointing."
2,My unfortunate purchase,"I received the product very promptly, and it was just as described, brand new, unopened, etc. Unfortunately I have very sensitive skin and eyes, so the hydroquinone ingredient that is the main thing that lightens the skin is the one thing that irritates mine. So I was forced to discontinue its use shortly after receiving it, therefore I am not qualified to comment on its effectiveness. The one thing good that came out of this experience is that I now know I can't buy anything with hydroquinone in it. So if you don't have sensitive skin like mine it may be worth a try."
1,STINKS !,"Unfortunately, I have no idea how effective Porcelana is in fading dark spots because I can't stand the smell.I put it on my hands and face and the odor was so unpleasant it gave me an instant headache. I thought the smell might fade with time (like my age spots, I hoped) but half an hour later, I gave up and scrubbed the stuff off. Even now, an hour later, soap-scrubbed and my favorite Dr. Hauschka rose cream applied, the scent of Porcelana is seeping through and making me faintly ill.Too bad, because the price is right. Tomorrow I'm trying Esoterica -- not a bad price either -- to see if I can stand the smell of it, or if it's simply the Hydroquinone ingredient that is the curse. We shall see.UPDATE: I've recently learned that Hydroquinoe is cancer-causing and toxic to the human body. No wonder it smells. So, that seals it. They all go back to the store."
4,Dark & unpleasant & commendable,"I got this book in hand bij mistake, and really never let it out again. It's not a nice book and it's not attractive, indeed it's dark and unpleasant and the characters are not always as rounded as the author thinks them. But it is exactly the disturbing nature of the things happening that kept me reading, and the thought that this is something lurking in most people's minds, somewhere- it disturbed me deeply, and months after reading it i'm still not comfortable thinking about this book. An example: I am,on beforehand, disgusted by sex with dogs. Still, the story pulls you in (unfortunate metaphor), so that when it happens, it is not really a surprise, and I accepted it as a logical outcome. That's what's so good about the book, and that is why I recommend it."
2,I Was Disappointed.............,"I expected so much more out of this book, but I guess I misread it before I bought it. All I got was a young woman whinning and complaining about her ""powers"" (??), and that they were too much for her. She hyperventilated, whinned, cried, and over indulged herself throughout the whole book. Her wimpy boyfriend (I'm sorry) was constantly rubbing her neck and telling her everything would be ok, and what could he get her to make her feel better (gag). I only made it through 1/3 of the book, and I couldn't stand it anymore. I'm sorry, but come on! Maybe it's just that the author is a little young and has some growing up to do.......I think so."
3,What interviews?!?,"I haven't even seen the book, but I just read its review in the Washington Post, which points out that there isn't a single interview with Michael Moore cited by Schultz in her bibliography. Whether this is her fault or Moore's, why does the publisher say above that interviews inform this biography??? Not true."
5,UB40 Rockplast 1982,"I found this a wonderful experience, to see this almost unknown band playing music with so much enthusiastic energy. It has a raw feel and gives an excellent portrayal of those early days including distortion and a request for more support from the mostly lifeless audience. An almost complete opposite of recent concerts where the audience are enthusiastic and the band just stands around."
2,Just Ok,"While I wanted to really get into this book, something made me too distracted. Too many people to keep track of and alot of boring dialogue made it hard to finish."
3,Is a quotation mark too much to ask for?,"While the book is easy to read (most books are, on the Kindle), for some reason, there's not a single quotation mark in the entire book. No apostrophes, no double quotes, no nothing. Makes it VERY hard to figure out when someone is speaking, or when you're reading expository text.This is the third Trek book I've encountered with the exact same problem. I hope they get better at converting books from print to Kindle format."
3,Good Trek,"Micheal Jan Friedman shows why he is one of the better Trek writers in Call to Darkness. It is standard Trek fare, not likely to linger in the memory for very long, but written in an engaging way. There are some flaws, of course, including a holodeck scene with Homer reciting the story of Cassandra (absent from the Odyssey; Virgil or Aeschylus would have been more accurate). However, it was good to see Pulaski again. Unlike every other character in Trek, we all know and have worked with a Pulaski-type; she was the most ""real"" of all Trek characters, and Friedman does a fine job of capturing her orneriness. Overall, A Call to Darkness is worth any Trek fan's time."
3,Get the message,"If you enjoy dark humor, political satire, and the movie ""Election"" (Is that redundant); then I highly recommend this gem of a movie. The movie is dated; but the subject matter is just as important, meaningful, and funny today!"
1,What a disappointment!,"I knew the subject matter was a bit edgy, but when the accolades on the DVD case say ""one of the funniest movies in years"" I expected at least a few smiles. I expected dark humor. I expected cutting satire.Instead, it is one of the most irritating, tedious films possible. The characters are either trivialized or stereotyped and all so pathetically portrayed as to make you not care who wins the battle for Ruth's fetus.Laura Dern gives a great performance as the damaged Ruth but just as you begin to care what happens to her ... the movie ends.Final word? Don't bother."
4,A breath of fresh air,"I appreciate Mr. Gough's book for the valuable insight offered by the 25 ""masters"" of finance. Indeed it is his choice of experts and his obvious appreciation for their accumen, moxie and well yes, success that makes this book a good read. Mr. Gough has a fine, clear writing style and we leave the book a bit smarter and perhaps a bit more interested in some of his muses. I recommend it!!"
2,A Baby for Grace,I did not like this book. There are way too many No's. I bought the book for a friend who has a daughter (Grace) who is having a baby boy soon. I would never recommend this book.
3,"A real strange one, still very entertaining.","Roc Tein stars as a lord in search of revenge against a local rival who is responsible for the death of his wife. On his mission he encounters a trust worthy monk to help his cause. they soon come face to face with a group of hired killers, a zombie fighter, and a creature that seems to be from something out of aliens. until finally he is able to go head to head with the one who ruined his life. Somewhat strange and off the wall movie, with some cool fight scenes and a cameo appearence by star Leun Kar."
2,Laughing right along with the main villian!!,"First of all let me just say that as a young kid in the early 80's I was a really big fan of the old school kung fu films. I couldn't wait until the annoying cartoons went off so I could watch the ""Saturday Morning Matinee""(Kung Fu Theater). Now, I don't remember seeing this movie but I could tell ya now that after seeing this movie present day that even as a youngster in the 80's I still would have been annoyed by this movie. I have read some of the other reviews and I honestly can't understand why on earth they would give it 5 stars. The fight scenes were not really that great, story was weak(which probably could have been solved with action), and worst of all was that dreaded laughing(speaking of the English Dubbed version). The movie starts out good at the very beginning then just starts getting worse. I do not recommend."
5,ANOINTED! BRILLIANT! ANOINTED!,"I truly admonish everybody to BUY this video and no-one will regret it! I purchased this two-part video series last December and, I tell you, it is so anointed that you'll wish you were there! Every time I watch it, I get something new out of it and it truly blesses me! Prophetess Bynum is a true woman of God and God has moved her to another level! In the first part of the video, she deals with the church as her message comes out of the book of Zechariah. The second part was even more brilliant, as I couldn't even sit back down. The Holy Spirit moved and delivered like a strong wind gushing past by!"
2,DO NOT BELIEVE THE BOX!!,"I bought this for my 5 year old son at Walmart about a week ago(paid $[...]) I would have been twie as bad if I had paid almost $[...]!!! Anyways, the picture on the box looks ALOT bigger than it actually is. One person cant slide down the slide while one person is in the pool let alone have 2 people sitting in it! The slide is so small and when you turn on the hose to let the sprinklers come down the orange top collopses and has no use! My son was very dissapointed and so am I! They really should put another picture on the box that is @ least closer to the acutal size! I usually dont write reveiws but just had to warn everyone, the box is lying when it says up to 12 years old, I would recommend it MAYBE for 1-4 year olds!"
1,This pool is dangerous!!!,"DO NOT BUY THIS POOL!!! The slide on the pool does not stay secured -- we knew what we were doing and had to tie it with something other than the ties that came with it. The slide slowly deflated some and the kids (3 year olds x2) were afraid to do up it. It was so wobbly that both took their spill off the side of it!!! Also, the whole pool was alot smaller than the box looked. The canopy was floppy and cheap!! The water fall hose leaked immediatly!! I was glad that we received this as a gift and did not spend the money. We will be taking down after one time of use ---- the company should recall this product --- the slide is a joke!!!"
3,"The pool is great, but the rest sucks!!","I read all the reviews, and saw how everyone complained about the slide, and the canopy, they are right, it sucks. I bought it because it didn't cost anymore then a pool without all the goodies, so I thought I would try it. I'm glad I didn't pay any extra for the slide and canopy. Ours slide isn't even touching the bottom of the pool or the ground on the other side of the pool. The canopy, would be great, if it was tied down, instead of velcroed (spelling). It falls off if the kid just bumps it. I'm glad I didn't pay any extra for the slide and canopy. If I were you I would just buy the regular rectanglar pool, save yourself the frustration. Then buy alot of pool toys. Just as much fun."
1,DO NOT BUY!!!!!,"This was a huge waste of $, even if it was only $[...]! Much smaller than shown (is it legal to ""photo shop"" something you are selling?), the air doesnt stay in, and as soon as i turned the sprinkler on (ever so slightly) it split the plastic tube! And customer service is always busy and does not respond to emails but Toys R US did take it back with no problem, even though the associate said none others were complained or returned, I find that hard to believe! What a was of time and $!"
1,Not worth $10,This would be great if your kids were 3 apples high. 1 normal size child can fit on it at one time.
2,Tiny Pool,"This pool is barely big enough for my 4 year old and 1 year old. The picture on the box is extremely misleading. My kids seem to enjoy it enough, but when my 4 year old slides, he has to wait for his 1 year old sister to step out of the pool because there isn't enough room for both of them. I would say the size of this pool is for 1-2 children ages 2-4 maximum. I would be very upset with this purchase if I had paid full price, but luckily I got a really good deal, so I am merely irritated."
5,Must have changed design LOVE IT,My only complaint is the slide it rises about 6 inches above the pool once filled with water. Didnt have problem with size ir basket ball hoop staying velcroed on.y 2 1/2 yo son and my 10yo btoter love playing in it. The basket ball hoop has been a huge hit for both fhe ring toss not so much but tgey have fun with the rings.
2,Spend a little more and get something else.,"I bought this for my 3 year old since he seemed to enjoy running under the sprinkler. The pool itself is ok, the slide seems sturdy but like other people have said keeping it in place is all but useless. Not to mention it's awkward for sitting down on and not much room to slide. The arch piece that works as the sprayer is a piece of junk. The material is so thin that within 30 minutes the seal near the hose was broken. I also had to keep the air pump outside. The side of the arch that holds the water lasts about 10 minutes before it deflates and collapses. Aside from the shortcomings my son did have fun with it but to have to fill the thing constantly and have to hold the slide in place so he doesn't fall off isn't worth it."
1,buyer beware,"The picture of this pool is fake. They took a picture of the pool, then added children on a different scale. My 4 year old fits in by himself. That's it. We did not even receive the top canopy piece in the box. I will never by from Banzai again as now I know the pictures are a lie and that is not what you will get. As far as people complaining about blowing it up, all inflatables are like that. Buy a cheap electric pump."
1,DO NOT BUY!!,"I PURCHASED THIS FOR OUR 2 SMALL BOYS AND THIS TURNED OUT TO BE HELL!! IT TOOK FOREVER TO INFLATE THIS EVEN WITH A PUMP, THE BASKETBALL HOOP LEANS OVER AND DOESNT STAY UP, THE STEP TO THE SLIDE IS EXTREMELY SLIPPERY THAT MY SON KEPT SLIPPING OFF OF IT AND I WOULD HAVE TO SIT THERE AND KEEP PICKING HIM UP DO GET ON THE SLIDE. THEN COME TO FIND OUT THERE WAS A HOLE IN THE BACK BOARD OF THE BASKETBALL HOOP AND A HOLE IN THE BOTTOM OF THE POOL!!! THERE FOR WE SENT THIS BACK FOR OUR REFUND AFTER TAKING ALL DAY TO DEFLATE THIS TOO!! I WOULDNT RECOMMEND THIS TO ANYBODY AND THE PICTURE IS VERY MISLEADING!! WONT FIT ALL THE KIDS IT SHOWS ON THE BOX!!"
5,Great beginner's book to crystals and stones,"I love this book because the writing style of the author is very down-to-earth, and she teaches about chakras, and healing the body as well as how to find, charge and dedicate stones. I think it's the perfect book for anyone who's interested in crystals."
3,"Quick, Semi-Entertaining Read","This book is basically about a girl who feels overshadowed by her sister, and eventually finds her own talents. It gives a half positive, half negative look on beauty pageants. I thought it was a very realistic book, though. ""Twenty Pageants Later"" was OK, but it is more of a short read. I doubt this will ever be a classic piece of literature. (I would have given it three and a half stars, but that wasn't possible)"
5,Twenty Pagents Later,"Fabulous! Twenty Pagents Later is an exellent book for teenage girls. This book includes good beauty tips and runway hints. For example, always smile and make the judges drool. This book does not include a lot of adventure. One thing it does include is a lot of good detail which makes the reader want to read on. I really want to know right now if Scottie Ann is going to be in the school's beauty pagent or not and if she is going to win. She might have a chance to win because her sister Dane has won ""Miss Almost Everything."" Jade is the coach for all the girls but especially for Scootie Ann and her best friend Lilly. I recommend this book to anyone who likes talent and the stage. This was a fabulous book!"
3,A tepid rewarming of C.S. Lewis' classic,"I looked forward to reading this book, expecting some really original and interesting twists. Unfortunately, I was less that satisfied with what appears to be simply a modernization of the classic ""Screwtape Letters"". While I did expect some similarities to the original story, I was disappointed with most of the conversations. Screwtape has been promoted since we last heard of him and the correspondence we read takes place via e-mail. It has been a while since I read this (over a year), but I would caution prospective readers not to expect anything more than a slight change of tone and setting with modern references.The biggest difference is the author's obvious approval of inclusion of icons as focal points for faith and worship, which I don't favor. The religious influence is much more of an Eastern Orthodox flavor than I am comfortable with, as well."
3,Good Video....but,"The moves are fine, the variety is fine, the music is livable. The editing is so sloppy that some moves get cut off right in the middle of them so the rhythm is messed up. And the male bashing (token male novice exerciser Eric is criticized every chance Susan gets, while his female colleague, expert Sally, can do no wrong) is annoying and hypocritical. The ""coaching"" is inferior to her earlier video. Turn down the sound and you'll be spared the self-serving politics."
2,SOME THINGS NEVER CHANGE,"I thought that this ""official revised edition"" would be a contemporary version of the catechism that I memorized in elementary school however this is the pre-Vatican II version. Although there are some positive ideas, the illustrations are archaic have no relationship to the real world. I find this book to be depressing and heavy.I recommend Good Goats : Healing Our Image of God by Dennis Linn, et al. Paperback (June 1994) as an antidote for the Baltimore Catechism."
5,Very good!,"Excellent for children and adults to learn the basics, of which many Catholics and or Christians do not have. The book is meant for children, but again many adults need to read."
3,Documentary like account of three Canadian Everest trips.,"Apart from the dry narrative and general seriousness of the book, the accounts of the three big Canadian expeditions on Everest are interesting. However, other than the first chapter, which examines why we climb, the text is generally lifeless and tends to focus on events and the main characters rather than draw the reader into the story.Similar in tone to Jim Curran's documentary style account of K2's ascents in ""K2 the Story of the Savage Mountain"", this book will probably not interest those who prefer imagery laden text and introspective comments."
1,Disappointed in their durability,"I bought these a couple months ago to wear in regular shoes since I walk to work every day. After two months, the fabric on top is separating from the rubber and causing my big toe to rub on the gel insert. For the price of these, I thought they would have lasted longer."
1,Waste of money !,I have used this product for about 6 months and have to say it is a total waste of money. I have several cats and when they have to stay in during bad weather they stress out and start to get grouchy and territorial. Even though I have this plugged into several rooms I see absolutely no difference. And It is SO EXPENSIVE ! Don't waste your time.
4,It seems to work,"We have two cats, and they don't get along all that well. The male cat is very active - we call him Scooter - and he constantly tries to play with the female cat, who does not appreciate his attentions, and shows her displeasure by peeing in inappropriate places. About 18 months ago we tried Feliway, and it calms them both down. One refill lasts about 5 weeks, so you'll go through about 10 refills (about $150 worth) in a year. Probably worth it if you have misbehaving cats."
5,Great Product,I use this when I introduce a new cat to our group or during stressful times like winter. With 7 cats they all accept each other and they don't make mistakes and always use there litter boxes. I believe this product has helped us have such a large family to live together peacefully.
5,Can't live without it!,"We have 6 cats and sometimes tensions run high. They are all close in age and get into quite a few squabbles if we don't keep our Feliway diffusers going. I love that I can purchase them in bulk. This product is great for putting everyone in a ""happy place"", including the pet owners."
2,Makes no appreciable difference,I've given up on this product after using it for several months in various rooms as it seems to make no appreciable difference in stopping or limiting my cat spraying.
5,Feliway Electric Diffuser Refills,"This product seems to work to keep my cats from pee'ing in several rooms in my house. I've used several products and banned them from those rooms, but they still were urinating in those rooms. I now have several diffusers in those rooms and in other suspect rooms in the house, and it has helped alot. Of course, this is in combination with lots of love, training, and not favoring one cat over the other...hard with 7 cats."
2,It Didn't Help,"This product was recommended by my Vet. to see if would help one of my cats get over a nervous twitch he developed when we introduced a new kitten to the family. Both Ricky and Frankie, the kitten, were always getting into fights as well. I used two plug-ins for about 4 weeks, using 4 bottles of the solution.Unfortunately, I saw no appreciable improvements in Ricky's twitch and they continued to get into fights.I am glad I tried it and would tell anyone to give it a try. Many have had a positive experience with it, per reviews I have read.Ricky still has the twitch, but they are getting along better and not fighting as much. Frankie, the kitten has been in our family for 5 months now. The other cat, Lucy, and Frankie tolerate each other and never had as major problem."
1,Did not work for my cat,"My cat started exhibiting inappropriate elimination behavior when our dog came to live with us. Instead of spraying, though, she poops outside of the box - often times right IN FRONT of the box. We've had her checked by the vet, bought more litter boxes, tried different kinds of litter, medication for IBS - nothing helped. I had heard about Feliway and decided to give it a shot - it did not work for my cat in the least. I think the only solution we haven't tried is kitty prozac. Ugh."
3,"Great Product, Great Price, LOOOOONG Ship Time.","This a great product at a great price, but although this item was ordered on 9/7 with 2-day shipping, it did not arrive until 9/18. The delayed ship time was not advertised until AFTER the item was purchased. I will likely not order this product from here again."
4,Peace Maker,"The purpose of this opinion is to share the fact that this product does seem to lessen the hostilities between two of my felines that have an extreme dislike for each other. As far as decreasing the amount of ""marking their territory"", that is mainly off and on so not sure this product helps in that area. Overall, I will continue to use it with the hopes that my fellas will get along one day."
5,for hippies or hippies at heart,"doHandmade Houses: A Guide to the Woodbutcher's Artif you are a still a hippie, a hippie at heart, or just not the typical brainwashed general usa home buyer who has one of those tract subdivision homes and want to break out of surburbia and drywall, or perhaps have a creative soul or one that just has not bloomed as yet - this book is the classic, spectacular inspiration of creativity - non traditional artistic shelters for you to awaken and actualize your own unique shelter -"
1,To Call This A Cinderella Story Is to Insult Cinderella . . .,"Maybe I hated this book because I am a native of Fredericksburg. And a dog lover. And a person who does not place strenuous demands on beach-bag fiction. But I was looking forward to a pleasant escapist romp, and instead found myself annoyed on almost every page. The writing is horrible. The plot, even by the most forgiving standards, tests your patience. (News flash: the CEO of a major corporation does not negotiate basic contracts, much less personally sign them. The lack of awareness or interest in getting right even the most basic facts about business life is a distraction. Why not make him a member of just the idle rich? Why Fredericksburg? Why not Middleburg?)Ugh.The whole book thing was clearly a necessary evil to sell a screenplay . . . but the day the camera crews show up on location in my town, I am grabbing my torch and pitchfork and storming City Hall!"
1,Just garbage,Worst 3d I have ever seen. I thought it was for 3d TV.So bad I gave the movie away to a guy I really hate!
5,Awesome photos!,"Unlike the famous areas of the West, Arkansas has very few great vistas from which to photograph. The views here are smaller, more subtle. Tim Ernst has captured many great images of Arkansas, from the well-known parks and views to the wilderness areas that few have seen. This is a must book for anyone who loves photograpy."
3,pretty good,"i liked parts of this film and felt it had moments but mainly from Jill Scott. she was beautiful and did the best overall performance in the movie to me. the film took bits from Soul Food, Oridinary People and the Color Purple and yet kept things Modern. the film had some peaks and valleys. the storylines were good but some things were hit and miss in places, still a interesting film.Tyler Perry is still the Most happening Cat Making films today."
4,Interesting movie but a little slow towards the end...,I enjoyed this movie. I liked the concept of profiling married couples and exposing the typical issues they face. The best parts of the movie occur prior to and include the dramatic dinner scene during the retreat. After that I felt the movie was slow and the plot a little flat.Overall I like Tyler's movies but wish he would have developed the storyline a little more towards the end.
5,why did i get married,the funniest DVDS i've bought in a long time pity that we are unable to buy these DVDs in England without going on an American website to purchase
5,"OK, I ADMIT IT, I WAS PREJUDICED AGAINTS THIS FILM!!!","I THOUGHT THIS FILM WAS GOING TO BE BORING BECAUSE I'M NOT ACCUSTOMED TO FILMS WHERE ALL THE ACTORS ARE BLACK---AND WHEN I'VE SEEN SUCH IN THE PAST THEY WERE 'SIT-COMISH' AND BORING. WAS I WRONG THIS TIME! THIS FILM HAS ""UNIVERSAL VALUES"" THAT APPLY TO ALL RACES AND ALL ETHNIC GROUPS. IT'S ABOUT RELATIONSHIPS IN AND OUT OF MARRIAGE AND HOW PEOPLE TREAT EACH OTHER. GREAT FILM! RECOMMENDED!"
3,Nice Chair,"Nice chair but hard to clean on the slatted sides, too much food gets stuck. Love the chair though - besides geting a little messy it's worth getting. Looks nice in the dining room."
4,Jewish Persecution in the old Soviet Ballet World,"I bought this book expecting a love story about Valery and Galina Panov, whom I was lucky enough to see dance 'Albanoni's Adagio' in the 70s. It was electrifying. As was the book, which was, indeed, about the love between the Panovs, their love and devotion to dance, and Valery's passionate love of freedom and the ability to make his own choices.It has all the elements of a romance novel: nasty divorce, ruthless government, wrongful imprisonment, suffering and degradation, and redemption and vindication. Quite a story!"
4,Well built,"bought these as a gift for my spouse. They found it well constructed and durable, and given the fine points, this is not cheap pot metal that loses it edges and points quickly"
2,Boring!,"If you like tutorials to be fun as well as informative, look elsewhere. I can't count the number of times my eyelids started drooping after 15 minutes because the material in this book is so dry. Unfortunately that dryness also extends to how well you pick up the information. Unless you really enjoy this style of writing, the mind begins to wander and you can miss important facts because all the facts just seem to run together. I'm sure the information in this book is supposed to be designed for the beginner with HTML and some programming experience, but the author doesn't make it very easy to digest."
2,Not For Beginners!,"I was given this book as a total beginner to JavaScript, and it was an extremely frustrating experience. The author writes in a very dry tone that will alienate those unfamiliar with programming concepts and protocol. I've looked at the JavaScript Bible in comparison, and it seems like a far superior resource for the JavaScript beginner. If you are a beginner, save yourself a great deal of frustration and look there first."
5,A must for true basketball lovers,"I remember seeing this movie for the first time when I was about 9 or 10 years old. It's one of the main reasons I wanted to be a point guard (well that and the fact that I'm only 5'3"" lol). I remembered really enjoying this movie and it just made me feel good about basketball. I'm 25 now and I still play basketball for recreation and to this day I still love this movie. Ranks among the top 10 of my favorite basketball movies!"
3,athletic socks,"I've always liked Fox River socks, but these are too thick and therefore take up too much space in my shoes."
1,Vacuumed sleeve,It stated that this was the right sleeve for my vacuumed but it was to short to fit on it
1,"Good book, poor design for Kindle version","I just bought the Kindle version of this book, and I already see two highly undesirable features. One is that words that have a footnote in the print version are underlined in the Kindle version, as if for emphasis. (These underlined words are links to the footnotes, but they look like emphasized words.) A second is that the line numbers in the Kindle version (every 5th line is standardly marked with a line number) appear in the body of the poem rather than in the margin, so that, e.g., [25] Every fifth line of the poem begins with a line number. These two features create a very poor reading experience. If I had known this, I would not have bought the Kindle version."
2,Not that great :-(,"I bought this speaker to use at my Zumba classes, but the sound quality isn't that great. It makes a buzzing/hissing sound especially at lower volumes and in between songs. I am pretty disappointed, it is going back and I will be buying something else."
2,terrible quality,"this product was bought for a specific purpose for me and only used to teach my fitness classes. it cuts out whenever it wants to, the feedback in between songs when using the ipod dock is horrible, and it lowers the volume or raises the volume whenever it likes. i wish i could return it. save your money."
2,intermittent microphone connection,"The product works great except 2 things:The wireless microphone does not maintain a constant connection (yes, i am using new batteries and the unit is fully charged). Expect to need to send it back for a replacement.Also, while an ""Ipod"" works in the unit - you can NOT use the dock with an ""Iphone"". There is interference even if you put your phone in ""airplane mode"" to turn off all external signals. You have to plug your Iphone in by plugging it in through the headphone jack - that works just fine (but no charging or ease of control via the dock)."
1,Worst ever...BEWARE,"Pyle-Pro PWMA930I 600-Watt VHF Wireless Portable PA System/Echo with iPod DockWe bought this for graduation ceremony and made the mistake of not opening it till May. The speaker had pulled all the screws out and was loose. The face is made of chip board so it can't hold a screw, they just break off. It should have been made of plywood, even 1/2 inch would have worked. And to top it off it was missing the wireless mic. The box was factory sealed. Beware of buying this. I'm very surprised amazon sells this, they ought to be embarrassed."
3,Allergies,"this perfume is the only thing I can wear and be able to have my husband come near me. I'm so glad, this is the only perfume (I thought) I wear. For the price, I didn't think it would be toilet water."
4,pretty good stroller,I bought this stroller for my 15 pound MalShi (1/2 Maltese 1/2 Shih Tzu) so that I could take her on my exercise walks & I am so glad that I looked at other comments that basically said to go bigger than recommended weight size so I went w/30# size which turned out to be perfect for my dog plus a little extra space. The directions were not perfect but gave enuf info to get to finished product. I also agree w/some comments that front zippered mesh when not zippered tended to be in the way but not a big issue. Now all I have to do is start my exercise walks!
3,Disappointed,"I bought this CD specifically because I couldn't find anywhere else Rachael Yamagata's rendition of ""I Wish You Love"", which was played at the end of the film. The soundtrack CD doesn't have the same version of the song that was used in the film, so buyer beware."
4,Hippies and Hell's Angels,"Do you want to watch a concert film or a movie about a really poorly executed concert that lead to a bad vibe and murder? You don't get enough of either in this film. The concert footage is remarkable - Mick Jagger is on fire and Mick Taylor is . . . maybe 20. As to Altamont - this film makes everyone who put it together look like a jerk - including the film makers (is this a snuff film because they show the murder (sorry to give away the ending - TWICE). Putting on a concert for over 100,000 over a weekend - don't think so. Hiring a gang for security - not too smart. Add annoying hippies (really annoying hippies)- disaster. At the end of the day, Sonny Barger has the voice of reason - go figure."
1,Don't wanna see a man killed,"I saw it second run - maybe in 1972.It might be a well made film. The music may be tremendous.Once I saw Hell's Angels kill on film, it was not about the music or about the quality of the film. You see in the early seventies, I was tired of seeing death. We just had years of Viet Nam on network news. I did not wanna see any more.Now, we do not see the reality of war. We do see massive amounts of gore in commercial film. Too many people are used to see death in the multiplex or on cable. I avoid those films."
5,Beautifully filmed..,"If anyone missed being at a Stones concert in 1969 - this is truly a must see film.. not only do you feel like your ""right there"" at all times because it's so wonderfully filmed, but also you will get that really sick in the gut feeling when things are going awry -like you ARE truly there, all starting when that fat naked women tries to pull her way up to the stage..you can almost smell the puke in her hair, the filming is so real and raw...all in all if you want a movie that leaves you feeling like you might of been there..this is for you..."
3,Nice Film.but not completely,"film only includes 3 songs on altamont,others all in the 1969 tourWho has the original 15 songs by stones on that altamont show?thanks to share thator hope this film can make a OST including that again"
4,Karaoke CD,The CD arrived quickly and in good shape and is in line quality-wise with other karaoke CDs we have purchased.
5,Couldn't put it down,"Ms. Kalpakian has tremendous talent; the story flows, the characters are interesting and there are always some surprises."
4,NYHC,"The ny harcore scene turned out some great stuff in the 80`s,billy milano`s m.o.d. were front and center,mixing punk and metal with humor that is fun for all."
4,Funny with a twist of social relevance,"Great lyrics, fast music, and pertinant subject matter. My personal favorite is spandex enormity, but it's been my favorite since the original album was released in the 80'sone last thing, WOOOOO! (courtesy of Ric Flair)"
2,This guy ain't no Sinatra.,"I do not see how reviewers can rate this guy 5 stars. His voice is so mediocre that I am suprised he manages to sell many cd's at all. I wouldn't waste my hard earned cash on this guy. Stick with Sinatra and get the best. If not, and you want someone who can sing Sinatra style, then I would recommend you listen to the young Canadian, Michael Buble. In my opinion Michael Buble is a much better singer that Tyrell. He can swing and do justice to that genre of music."
2,fell apart fast,bought this not so long ago and I am having to replace it already. One handset died shortly after I purchased it and the speaker phone on the other does not work. The batteries run out fast and do not charge right and the answering machine does not record every time. If you do not let it ring several times before answering the caller ID never registers and you have to risk someone hanging up just to get a number to show up. Not happy with the purchase.
5,phone,I received the phone when expected and it was brand new as advertised. It works great and I have had no problems.
5,This book is about making a difference!,"Alan Downs' book The Seven Miracles of Management is about making a difference. It moves beyond our old experiences and gives us the courage to use miracles that will make a difference in how we live with ourselves and build sucessful thriving businesses. Sylvia Rayfield, President Mentoring Inc. Executive Director ICAN Publishing Inc."
4,"Excellent synopsis of material covered in Ambrose's ""Citizen Soldiers""","What seems a simple parlor book from the editors of Time is actually a history book of some substance. It highlights a lot of the topics covered in books such as ""D-Day,"" ""Band of Brothers,"" and ""Citizen Soldiers"" by Stephen Ambrose, who amongst others historians, is cited in this book. Excellent overview of D-Day for students and teachers alike."
5,Photoshop Restoration and Retouching,Very detail lessons. Not for the Photoshop novice. A good working knowledge of Photoshop is needed. Excellent learning tool for those interested in all aspects of photo restoration and retouching.
3,interesting tricks,"this book has some very useful info regarding retouching, some of which i had never seen before, but i don't like that fact that she shows readers the color balance and levels tools as they are for AMATEURS only!!!!! if you were to start using those tools during an interview you would severely limit your chances of landing the job. Despite this issue I would still recommend this book."
1,Don't waste your money on this battery,"Don't waste your money on this battery. The battery that comes with the unit lasts about 30% longer then this one does even though it has a lower MA rating. The battery that comes with the phone is a Lithium Polymer battery. This one is only Lithium Ion which has less capacity for same size.The 1000 MA rating must be incorrect because field use proves otherwise. If you are looking for an inexpensive backup battery and not looking for longer run time, then this is a good choice."
1,Be careful when buying batteries,Don't buy!!! Look elsewhere for this batteryThis battery only worked better then my 2.5 year old original battery for about a month then it degraded to lasting the same as my 2.5 year old original battery. As other reviewers stated I also suspect that this was a refurbished battery.I have purchased many batteries of different types on the web and you need to be careful that you are buying from a reputable vendor. My best results have been with battery specialist.
4,Somewhat interesting for history buffs,"Has some good shots of what was then and what is now. Very well laid out. Would have been nice to make this into a coffee-table sized book with larger pictures. The detail with each picture is well laid out. Some topics were completely missed, where other topics had too much attention (the old high school, really?)."
2,Looks Good - Doesn't Work,Cooling system lasted less than six months and never did get very cold. Very disappointed with the quality of this product. Still trying to find the manufacturer for a fix.
3,Good,"I was slightly disappointed, I heard her other cds and wanted those so bad, but unable to get them, so when this was released I had to get it, knowing it would be just as great. I did not like this effort as much as the others but still good and better than alot of the R&B artists out now. So for those new to Ms. Doss please check out the other cds before making an opinion about her."
2,dial t for turn it off,"rich college kids pretending to be scum-rock. their gimmick definitely worked better when they only knew one chord and seven words you couldnt say on television. there's just a couple of keepers on this one. the best part of the cd is the intro, which features a profanity laden rant by jon spencer randomly bleeped, which leads into the raucous understand me. although common sense tells you that the more you know, the better you are, pussy galore has always been stuck in a conundrum: they were educated and were better musically than they let on, so their whole career was a pose. again, it dont matter if yer a poseur as long as you RAWK convincingly. listen to corpse love or right now to hear them pull it off."
3,Enter the new Robin,"This book collects the entire storyline that ran thru the Batman and New Teen Titans comics. It was a good focus on the relationship between Batman and Nightwing (the former Robin). Here we find Batman and just how important a family is to him though he'd never show it. I loved this book as it also spotlighted Dick's (Nightwing) detective skills and find him working together with Batman to track down Two-Face. This book was also responsible for introducing to us Tim Drake who is to become the latest Robin. The only shame is that this book doesn't really resolve the relationship between Batman and Nightwing and I'm sure most readers are still unfamiliar as to why they are so distant to each other now when they used to be the Dynamic Duo. But for the most part, buy this book for Tim Drake."
5,"Favorite carols, very playable, will bring much JOY!","50 Christmas Carols for All Harps by Sylvia Woods.This is one of the first books I purchased, of the many books by Sylvia Woods, and it is a constant favorite. Every carol I have ever sung is in this book . All of the pieces are beautifully arranged and playable by everyone because there is both an easy and an advanced arrangement. Friends and I play these two versions as duets during the Christmas season. This book is a must for all harp players and will bring you and your listeners a lot of JOY!"
4,Basic concepts,"I like the way the author shows different techniques, way more than most of candlemaking books. However, tve explanation isnot so detailed, I mean this book is good for a candlemaker with some previous experience but not for the beginner. In my case, i saw some techiques that I could apply and that is why I will buy it"
5,great scope - lousy shipping,Ordered this for my grandson for his first hunting season. Shipping was supposed to be 7-10 days . Took over a month and he only got it after I called the company twice. Emails never got answered.If you can wait a long time for shipping then this is a great little scope. He got a 4 pointer!
3,Okay,Malik Yoba is a great actor but it was't really portrayed in this play. I think if the point would've been made sooner then the play would've been excellent but it took a little while to get there which made cringe at times. Not saying the lay was bad because it wasn't just a little slow in arriving to the point. but i'd still recommend it since just because i felt this way don't mean others will. it;s inspirational and does have a point to prove.
2,Short life,"The original set of struts lasted ten years, this replacement is bad after only two years."
3,SELLER DOES NOT ANSWER E-MAILS,"Ordered book because it was recommended reading before an important meeting. E-mailed seller twice to check on shipping. No response either time.Book was in okay condition, but more ""yellow"" around the edge than expected."
5,Classic text,"Without doubt, one of the best books ever written on successful negotiating. Fisher and Ury nailed it. Their system is appropriate in just about every arena, enabling you to take a professional approach and avoid the histrionics. A must read for anyone who wants a win/win outcome."
3,Simple exposition on decision making,Why decision making falters and why do we decide what to do? Simple and easy to read. A good collection. Negotiations are basic skills for managers and what to do for improving these skills.
5,Must read for anyone,"We dont notice, but we negotiate with someone about something just about every day. Reading this outstanding book enlightened me and made me a much more effective negotiator."
3,Getting to Yes: Negotiating Agreement Without Giving In,"Purchased as required material for an undergraduate course. While I didn't find it as inspiring as other required material purchased, it did make itself useful."
4,good book,the book was assigned for my counseling and negotiations class. A lot of the things covered in the book were common sense things but the book was still helpful
4,like it.,I have been wanting this book because I used it for a class. It is a very good thing to have it at your office and teach you about conflict resolution!
1,Boring,"This book took ten months for me to read. It was dull, boring, insipid, and writting on a level much higher than it needed to be written on. I fully expect that less than 1% of those who bot this book read past the first chapter without falling asleep.Don't misunderstand. I have a PhD and understood the work but it would have been much easier for the millions of people who bot this book to get through if it had been written on a lower level.If you want to know about this book I suggest getting a book summary and think through that."
1,Not too bad.,The few classics were great to hear again. The voiceover versions with the cast are cute but annoying the 2nd time around.I fail to understand why so many orchestra songs are included on a kids album. That's the killer.Skip the purchase and download the songs you want on the net.
2,ummm...,"well i haven't bought the cd yet, but the orchestra songs at the end of the album were a bit out of place. i liked the first couple of songs but as i just said the orchestra songs should have been on a different cd."
5,Her favorite gift...,"I bought the CD to accompany the movie. My four year old watches the movie everyday. When I gave her the CD, after listening to it nightly, she takes it to bed with her everynight where I have to pry it out of her hands after she falls off to sleep. I don't get it, but she does...so it's worth what I paid for it."
4,Works fine,"I bought this as a part of the setNordic Ware Microwave 6 Piece Essentials Cook Setsince I wanted other parts and total price was about the same.I find whipping out an omelet in a skillet is just as quick so I don't use this.. but I did verify that if you follow the instructions this works ok (you may have to adjust a bit for your specific microwave)Unlike the egg poacher, the hinge on this works well (how can they make THIS one work right, but make the poacher soooo bad???)"
3,flip failures incomplete,on two successive uses on different days when trying to complete the flip to finish the omelet i had to scrape the omelet loose from the surface of the plastic pan. Do I have to lubricate the plastic pan sides before making the omelet and if so what should be used? I can not seem to fill in the #5 tag below but i would say --flip flopped
5,Refreshingly relevent,"I was given a copy of this by my RCIA sponsor. What a wonderful book. While aimed at adolescents, it conveys the truths of God in a uncomplicated and friendly way. No mumbo-jumbo. No modernist equivocation or hand-wringing. Just the truth.Now that it has been a year since I came into the Catholic church, I find that what I remember about this book are the pictures. The pictures in the context of what they are trying to teach. A boy calling to friend that he is going to confession. The ship with the sails of the gifts of the Holy Spirit. That is how I remember these. The images, and the memories they produce, are priceless and will have ETERNAL benefits!You are not too old, too well read or too well catechized NOT to open this up and read it from time to time."
1,bad,I have not received it but they had no problem charging my credit card for it over a month ago. I would have given zero stars but that was not an option.
5,PERFECT FOR EMERGENCIES,"This product will do exactly what it is ended to do. Keep you warm in the event of an emergency. With a family of 4, 10 is more than enough to double up each of us and use the remaining two for shelter purposes and/or distress signals!I highly recommend this product!GREAT VALUEU.S. Marine - War Veteran APPROVED"
5,Great price!,I purchased these to make emergency kits for my families cars. They are not expensive and could save their life if they break down.My brother used a few to line a dog house he made. My mom used one as a sun shade in a garage window. You can see outside but it reflects the heat back out the window. Great little gifts for people and have many uses.
3,You could find a better one,"These blankets wasn't what I thought. Disposable and for 1 use only. Even if they work nice, I needed another kind of blankets."
1,Bought 10 and received 1!,"I received my package today thinking that I would have 10 packs inside, since that is what I ordered. Instead, one pitiful package fell out which wasn't even the same as the one pictured above. I assume that there must be something wrong with the shipments going out of this business. I hope they remedy this quickly since they still owe me 9 more packs."
5,Its so thin;,"Shipping arrived on time; These are tiny blankets ,thin and holds body heat very well; While opening the sheet on edge some portion got teared away ; but still these sheets feels warm and strong."
5,Emergency Mylar Thermal Blankets (Pack of 10),"It works rain or shine. Great to keep in glove box of car. Good luck. Hope you never have to have it. However, it's best to be prepared just in case. Price is right."
3,Thankful I haven't had to use,"I purchased this for emergencies. Thankful I have not used it, hopefully I won't need to, but if I need it I got one."
5,Emergency Mylar thernal blankets pack of l0,These blankets are perfect. They are everything I expect and more. thank for for sending them as fast as you did.
4,As described,"I ordered 10, 10 arrived, they are very compact and perfect for what I wanted. I hope to never have to remove them from their packets!"
2,half a step above junk.,"Emergency blankets are usually used in (oh, I don't know) an EMERGENCY. That being said, these blankets tear extremely easily. They just are too thin. Don't waste your money."
4,Not Bad,The bits were good quality for the money however the red plastic case was not molded to fit the parts tight. Some of the bits fall out upon opening and closing. If your not using it a lot I would recommend it.
1,Cheap quality,i thought i'm ordering quality products on Amazon but this turned out to be cheaper ebay quality. most of the bits are defective.
4,Good Deal for the Price,This kit is exactly what I was looking for. I need to open a Directv DVR and it had the tamper proof screws on it. This did the trick. Would be nicer if the kit had a place to put the driver in but overall its a great deal for the price.
1,Marginal book at best,"The best book I found on showing your dog is ""Raising a Champion"" by Meredith John and Carole Richards. No one uses a clicker in the ring, so this book is kind of pointless."
2,Only worked for a week,"I used this in Europe for a few days and everything was fine. But then it died -- I""m not sure why. Fortunately I brought another adapter as well. Since my trip went beyond the return-date policy of Amazon, I can't return it and just need to toss it. Make sure when you purchase it that you can use it and be back in the U.S. to return it if need be."
1,You're in trouble?,"Where do I begin? Let's start how the book does, shall we? In fact, you'll get the whole book until Amazon pulls this review.""If you mess with Goosey Goose, you are in trouble. AAWW (...), trouble. Not with her father. Not with her mother. Not with her brother. Not with her sister. But with her! Uh-huh Uh-huh. Goosey Goose!""WHAT??? This is just the image that I want to give to my 3 year old daughter: a bully goose that will kick your butt.Please, save your money and find something good. Like a chalupa."
5,great gate,easy to install and easy to use.I would recommend this to any one looking for a gate.would purchase again
5,Dogs up! Cats down!,Just what we needed. At the top of the basement stairs. Cats jump right over. Dogs can't get downstairs. Thank you.
2,"Not expandable, name too similar to one that is","Bought this ""Supergate Easy Close"" to keep the dog on the lower level of our home during construction. Reading through the different gating options it seemed that this gate could be expanded with some add-ons while being cheaper."
2,NOT FOR CHILDREN OLDER THAN 18 MONTHS,"While this gate seems to be sturdy, it did not work for my purposes. I bought it to keep my 26 month old in his room at night time. Well he figured out how to open it in about 5 minutes. It took longer than that to put up and take down"
5,Great gate,"We got this for our two dogs (both under 20lbs.). It's worked great for our purposes. It was easy to install, and stays put. Very simple to open/close/lock."
5,worked like a charm,Does everything it supposed to. Keeping kids and pets out of certain areas. Easily installation. Did it by myself. Would recommend.
4,great gate,"very happy with this gate so far.. only reason I do not give it 5 stars was that it was a bit tricky to install but not difficult. I used the included cups that uses double sided tape and it was a bit tricky getting them in the right spot as once they were on, hard to remove but still had it up in about 35 minutes.It works really well with my shepherds. Its also not too high so that I can just step over it and not have to constantly open and close it.It fits well even with molding at bottom as its fully adjustible. I needed one of the extension panels. Has a stay open feature when not needed and gate also swings closed automatically.well built...like it."
4,Good product,"Quite weel made, this gate is very strong and useable. The extensions compromise the gate's strength and wider pads may be needed. I used wood blocks."
1,"Never ""came together""",No matter how I tightened or adjusted the closing never fully came together. Its also EXTREMELY narrow. I was using this at the bottom of stairs and it just made going up and down soooo difficult! Sent it back and got another Cardinal Gates Stairway Special gate (which I also use at the top). See my review there.
4,good quality,"although we had to return this as our top and bottom stair dimensions were a couple inches too wide (my fault i didn't look closely enough to product dimensions) they product itself after i opened and inspected it (never got to install) looked of good quality, metal was seemed sturdy and strong. again - didn't get to the point of installation but if they made this exact gate that was wider i would purchase it."
4,works for my needs,"needed for dogs (labs) I have installed on stairs to be able to keep dogs up or down. Like that you can walk thru and door will stay open if you wish. once installed it is very sturdy. Takes a bit to get it up, about 15 minutes, but once up... I am very pleased."
4,Don't buy it from textbooksrus.com unless you want huge ugly stickers all over it,"The book itself is fine. I ordered it because it is a required textbook.It should be an inexpensive book considering its physical quality (almost coloring book quality paper).Some sections are straight forward but the theories can be incredibly dry. I've started marking, circling, highlighting and underlining important information; otherwise, like my classmates, I get to the bottom of the page and don't remember what I've read.I've found it useful to highlight using pencil highlighters (aka ""bible highlighters"").This book is fine, but don't order from --TEXTBOOKSRUS--, because they slap a huge, ugly sticker on the front cover, the title page and the copyright page. Don't try to remove the stickers, because that just makes things worse.All in all, not a bad book. It has useful information; just watch the Marketplace vendor --TEXTBOOKSRUS--."
4,Good Film,"Monsters, Inc. is a good film. The DVD however lacks special features that other DVD's have. When you play the movie there is an option of Widescreen and Fullscreen so that is nice. I watched it in Widescreen. This film is great for kids and even adults. The movie is funny. If you liked Toy Story or Toy Story 2 you MUST see this movie."
5,ONE OF THE BEST MOVIES OF ALL TIME!,"I would give this movie a million stars if I could! I could watch it hundreds of times and never get tired of it!It's got a very original, wonderful storyline. The animation is amazing. Best of all, the whole family can watch it. Boo is SO lifelike and adorable. It is SO funny and entertaining! All the bonus material on the DVD is really fun, too. I could say SO much more in favor of this movie, but I'll let you wait and decide for yourself. Believe me, you won't be disappointed!"
5,"Monsters Inc,",Great movie. My four year granddaughter loves it. She has watched it numerous times and giggles everytime. I just purchased it for my three year old granddaughter for Christmas.
1,poor quality,The movie froze right in the beginning so we didn't get to watch it. My grandchildren were very disapointed with their gift.
3,"Good movie, but not for kids?","I can't seem to win nowadays with what Hollywood is putting out for the kids... I bought this dvd for my four and a half year old son and it scared him so much that he cried! Great movie and animation and everything - I mean, I really enjoyed it - but I didn't think a rated ""G"" movie would bring my son to tears! Apart from the scary stuff, what's up with the hitting and punching and beating each other up? What are they trying to do? It just makes me so mad when I can't even sit and enjoy a CARTOON without having to explain what's happening with all the violence! I think they need to change the ""G"" rating to ""PG"" or something more defined like ""G-7"". Great movie, but if you have little ones, don't buy it!"
4,I Definantly Reccomend,"This was an awesome movie with great characters. I watch it a lot, even though the story kind of drags on and on. After a while you do just get sick of watching it. But overall it is a nice movie, but not good for toddlers. My 2 year old cousin got really freaked out and had to leave the theaters because of the ""randall"" character. But if you are looking for a good story, good animation, and good characters, I would not hesitate to buy this DVD."
2,blu ray disc problems,"i have always loved this movie and was excited to get this along with Up as a package deal on amazon. unfortunately, i have tried two copies of the movie and neither work on my year old panasonic player."
4,Everything Pixar touches is gold,"Unlike their contemporaries at Dreamworks, the folks at Pixar continue to turnout high quality entertainment with excellent special effects and computer animation time after time. This movie is great for young and old alike. As opposed to the traditional fairy tale type story, Disney has taken a different approach this time. Instead of human or animal heroes, we have monsters. It has the usual entertaining Disney storyline, complete with enough twists and turns to keep it enjoyable. And, true to form, Disney has made this film both funny and entertaining. This is a definite keeper, and will be a great addition to anyone's Disney or animated film collection."
5,"Monsters, Inc.","This movie is great. I bought it for my 7-year-old daughter, but I love it. Plus, it has extra activities on the second disc for kids to have fun with. This movie is funny, action packed, and it's great for all kids, even adults who are kids at heart."
5,One of the best!,"This is a great addition to any kids collection. This has all of the charm of older animated features, but the spunk of today's youth is evident throughout."
5,Great!,I received package in great time. Plays wonderfully. No complaints. Would buy from them again.
3,Monsters Inc.,"Monsters, Inc. [Region 2]Monsters Inc. is a clever original story with likable characters, lots of humor, and an enormous amount of imagination. The alternative, but instersecting with our own, monster universe draws us in seamlessly. And of course, laughter being more powerful than anger is a wonderful theme. Good for kids of all ages, definitely."
5,kids love it,the kids love this movie and its one of the few i dont mind watching over and over again.
5,Great Family Film,"This is a very sweet movie and I would recommend it to anyone, even people with out kids. The animation is top notch, but what sets this movie a part is its soul. I can't remember the last time that a movie touched me in such a sweet way. John Goodman and Billy Crystal have excellent chemistry and are very entertaining.Go watch this today!"
4,Outstanding!,"This movie is a technological marvel. Pixar uses computer animation to create a movie that is both enjoyable and interesting.Many people were once afraid of (or still are) monsters in the closet, but what if the monsters were more scared of us than we were of them? What if they were just doing their job?The movie is sure to entertain and delight viewers of all ages, and the DVD quality is very good. I am not so impressed by the special features. I would've expected more on a two DVD set, although there are a few really neat things on the second disc.Overall, I would definitely take a look at Monsters, Inc."
5,Monster's Inc.,I ordered this for my great neice to watch since she enjoyed it so much at the theaters. Excellent movie.
3,So So,"Why do people think this movie is so great? I mean all it is about is some monsters that find out it's not so great to scare little kids. The only reason I rated it 3 stars is because I'm trying to be nice, ok!"
5,A surprise for Disney...,"This is perhaps the most _un_-Disneylike Disney kid's movie, in that many gags and takes remind one of the WB/MGM shorts of the 1930s to the 1950s, in the vein of Bob Clampett, Chuck jones and ""Tex"" Avery.This is not a bad thing, really- This was wonderfully executed by the guys at Pixar that certainl.y give more than a wink and a nod to the greats, and deserves all the kudos it deserved for its theatrical release, and no doubt the forthcoming DVD release will earn more raves... and certainly more bucks for the coffers of both Disney and Pixar, especially at a time where there has been strainjs between the two companies.I'll let everyone else give their synopses of the movie, and just say: Buy it, you won't regret it. :)"
1,NOT in Spanish,My school purchased this DVD for my Spanish class. The cover came sealed in perfect condition. The cover was in Spanish. BUT unfortunately the disc doesn't have the option of Spanish audio. I had to return the DVD. No one could guarantee that if I got a replacement that it would have Spanish audio. IF you are interested on the Spanish language track. This is not it.
4,Monster inc,"I was really having trouble finding this dvd - it was a great price,condition was good and it came very fast. My grandkids are excited."
1,Crap,I had this item expedited because it was suposed to have been a gift but it took 4 weeks to come in. Then come to find out the disc would not play at all!
1,Did not play,"It did not play. I bought this for my grandchildren and by the time they visited, I had discarded the papers. It would not play on our DVD player."
4,Good movie,"This movie is good, but I just can't rate it as high as Shrek! I thing the whole concept is a little much for kids under 3 or 4. I was impressed with the imaginative story line as well as the animation. Worth the $. I just wish movie makers would quit using up so much time on advertising at the front of the movie (this one is especially hard to get to PLAY; my DVD player is only 5 months old)."
3,Not bad,The bag is ok for a beginner guitarist but the description should have mentioned that. I wouldnt spend more than $20 for it. Not padded at all.
5,Excellent,"It is shocking how much you can save by buying AC-Delco on Amazon. These replacement products work great and combined with the fast shipping it's a win, win, WIN."
3,"'N Sync good, direction and edition mediocre","I bought this DVD because I like 'N Sync music, how they sing and I think their choreographer is excellent. I went to see the IMAX movie about this same tour, shorter but very well made, impecable direction and editing, camera angles that really enhance their dancing and the show. Then I got this DVD, and I got disappointed: this version of the show uses too many circling cameras, camera angles that don't allow to enjoy the dancing, and the editing doesn't transmit the power of the performance. It's a shame: Michael Jackson, Gene Kelly, and almost all dancers know that the best way to show a dance is with fixed camera angles, not from the top, or the back or a camera circling like crazy around these guys. Fire the director, guys, and don't do any other HBO show. And please, publish the IMAX version on DVD so I can trash this one."
4,*NSYNC Live at Madison Square Garden Review,"*NSYNC, could probably be called the most popular group in existence right now. With their sell-out tour, record breaking CD and adoring fans, these guys have seen heard and done it all. Now with the release of *NSYNC Live from Madison Square Garden, they are about to bring their sell-out concert experience to your house.Having attended the ""No Strings Attached"" tour here in Portland, I was stunned at the amount of energy these guys put forth on a daily basis. I was then thrilled when I heard there was a DVD in the works of their HBO Concert Special. Recorded with 20+ cameras, HBO really enhanced the experience by getting you up close, something that many would appreciate.Although this DVD is bare bones with basically a photo album being the only bonus material, the concert is enough. You will be glad for the opportunity to remember the awesome time you had, or would have had."
1,I Really Do Like NSYNC,"Ok, so I bought this expecting it to have some extras on it, but there was nothing. I could've saved my money and just recorded the concert when it aired on HBO. Plus it also shows that they don't change their show. I took my 10 year-old cousin to see them at Nassau Coliseum back in November, and the whole thing was identical to what you saw on HBO. The whole thought of going to a concert, is to see something different. These guys need to mix up the songs a bit, or change some of the choreography (some of the dances have not changed since the last tour). I know these guys have the talent,so there is no need for it to be redundant. Even my little cousin left disappointed. There were no suprises, nothing to make you feel like your concert was special. I am not saying each concert has to be unique, but mix everything up a bit."
4,"Not as thrash as MOD for USA, but a good effort.","Billy Milano and crew were going for a more conventional and commercial album with this release. As if MOD could ever be commercial. But with songs like No Hope, Satan's Cronies, and No Glove no Love, the message is a bit more uplifting than efforts such as Aren't you Hungry. But we love Billy for his biting tongue in cheek humor, and fortunately we have plenty of that here as well. My favorite song on the album is ""I love Living in the City"". You can't beat a song about the comic misfortunes about urban living.Maybe the highpoint of the album is the simple and beautiful lyrics that read as follows ""I'm Billy Milano I'm a bold courageous man.....not only am I Elvis, sometimes I'm James Dean (and Tom Cruise!)"
2,Locks Up,I am on my 2nd unit and both lockup after a short time. Neither the remote nor the front buttons will work when it locks up. You have to unplug it and leave it unplugged for at least 5 minutes - maybe longer. It works good when it is working!
1,Trouble with VCR,"This product(Philips DVP3150V HiFi DVD/VCR Combo, Purchased on 11/09/2008)was supposedly refurbished but the VCR section was defective. I returned it to the DiscountJungle/Amazon.com vendor but still haven't received a replacement.Fred Schroeder"
4,Philips DVP3150V HiFi DVD/VCR Combo,"This unit was bought at a great price. It arrived in its original factory carton and everything I needed for a fast hookup was in the box. I have been using it for a month and am completely satisfied. While it doesn't have all the bells and whistles of a more expensive unit, it work just fine for our needs."
5,Great Cookbook for busy people,I use this cookbook several times a month when we want to try a new recipe. Everything we have made has turned out good.I like the simplicity of the recipes and the 5 ingredients list. Keeps it simple but delicious.
2,Caution required,"Violin looked nice, good carry case. Bridge was too high and had no notches for strings. I had to take it to my local music shop to have it fixed.After tightening the strings the string holder snapped.Local music store fixed it for me free of charge and said the ebony was of poor quality which is typical of Internet purchases.My local store will have any future business."
2,Adjustable Handle is not very secure,"Love the mop head, hate the hardward. The mop handle collaspes continually. Very disappointed. Seller was very good and sent me a new one. I hope it works.Rubbermaid G780-04 Pva Roller Mop"
4,Very Good***,"First, I am very pleased to see this movie on DVD. I owned it a few years ago on VHS. I have seen the movie numerous times. Why do I like it? No cursing, or suggestive themes. A very clean movie, especially when compared to the drivel being put out today.You see how characters change as they begin to realize that a Voice they have heard on the radio is no ordinary voice. The transformation of the characters is very encouraging."
5,Satisfied,The condition of this CD was as advertised. There were no problems playing this disc. I would purchase from this seller again.
5,"Awesome recipes, with great coupons","A very informative cookbook with easy, great tasting recipes! I am so glad to find such a cookbook. Our family is looking forward to the next dish!"
3,Nothing really special just an average reference book,"I was expecting more details and pictures of the real items. Yes there are some real pictures but way more drawings. The front cover shows pictures of three uniforms, but once you open the pages of the book there are more drawings that are more like art rather than seeing what the uniforms were really like by seeing real ones you get to see drawings/paintings of uniforms that may or may not resemble the real uniforms of the day. This is more of a basic starter reference book that I was hoping would be more into detail of actual uniforms."
4,Geared screwdriver,"Functions as described.NOTE: Because you get a speed increase from handle to bit of 4:1, you also get 4x more torque required. If the screw is slightly tight expect to use a lot of torque or opt out of speed mode."
5,Wow! Should have bought this years ago!,"I've been pressure washing a 5000ft2 house for 8 years now every fall. This year I decided to try a turbo nozzle, and it cut the time by 2/3. It rotates at high speed, so it essentially cleans a 4-5"" wide swath at the same impact pressure as if it were just a high-pressure pencil-size stream. It got my white siding incredibly clean. Not that a standard nozzle won't do that, but cleaning a 1/2"" wide path at one time would take forever. I highly recommend it. I used it on a briggs 2400psi pressure washer and it worked great."
5,Best pressure cooker out there!,"This is a great pressure cooker. I had another that I didn't like and decided to just get a Presto one. I like that rack inside that suspends food so it doesn't burn on the bottom, and it is neat and clean."
1,RETURN IT,"Handle gets loose. Also, the handle pops and breaks apart as it heats up. It literally pops and explodes, bits and pieces go flying, hot drops of plastic! I returned mine."
5,"Modern, up dated recipes","My new pressure cooker is almost the same as the first Presto Pressure Cooker that I recived as a wedding gift in 1963. The recipes are so different but give the same great, fast results. I still have my old 1963 recipe book and it has no recipe like Chicken Breasts Tarragon which is in the new cookbook. My new pressure cooker has more safety features than my old one so I am even more confortable using a pressure cooker. I was disappointed that the extra glass lid that you can order does not fit my model. [[ASIN:B00002N601 Presto 01241 4-Quart Aluminum Pressure"
1,It is rusting already,"The three screws, included in the package, with which the customer attaches the handles to the cooker as well as the two screws that hold the cover handle mount began to rust after a few weeks. I called the manufacturer, Presto, and they sent me three new screws without charging me. But these screws are now rusting too."
5,I LIKE TENDER MEAT,"I've used Presto cookers for years. This one does a super job of tenderizing even tough meat. Since I go for well done meat, I usually cook it for about twice the time recommended in the instruction book. The steam pressure is easily regulated on both gas and electric stoves."
5,"Very good buy, I would recommend to all","I have had no problems with these sticking in the charger, as reported by another customer. There has been no problems with the batteries hold a charge or working correctly in my camera. Sure beats the local Batteries Plus (39.95 for 1 battery)"
4,A great tale,"_Jackaroo_ is a complex fantasy about Gwyn, an innkeeper's daughter, who secretly takes on the role of Jackaroo, a Robin Hood-like legend. The story traces her experiences as she discovers what it truly means to be a hero and a human being. Gwyn is a brave and fascinating heroine, and I highly recommend this book."
5,Cool.,This book rocks! I'm doing a book report on it. Anyone who want's to read a book about historical fiction / middle ages should read it.
5,"So comfy, but smells like thin mints","I recently moved into my college dorm and my mattress feels like a box spring. I got this topper to help, and now my bed feels like heaven."
4,Excellent Topper only if your bed is semi-decent,"This is a very comfortable topper and it has improved my sleeping posture significantly. The only issue I had with it is that it still needs a semi decent bed to work well. The current bed i am on has worn out springs and while the topper helps, it can be better."
4,Sleep studio memory foam 3 inch,"The mattress came wrapped up in a tight roll, king size was very heavy carrying upstairs. I unwrap the padded nd immediately it started to take its shape. I left it along for a few hours. The was a very mild hint of mint which wasn't so bad at first because I like the mint however 4 nights in the mint smell was over powering, my whole bed set including pillows stuck of mint and so did we. We torn everything off again and I pretty much soaked it with gain frefreeze. I hope it helps.As far as the comforter, my husband likes a 2 in but I like the 4 in so we went in the middle and went a 3 In. It is very comfortable butthead pad isnt as cool as it is described. The last few nights has been very hot but maybe as it wears in and winter coming it will all workout!"
1,Too Squishy,"This pad is way way too soft for me. I get up with upper back pain, and I can feel the lower back pain coming. (Actually, it's quite comfortable for my hips.) All the how to pick a mattress topper tell you about firmness ratings--and none of the mattress toppers list firmness ratings! I'm returning this.On the positive side, it didn't smell bad at all, even right after opened.I bought a different cheap one from Amazon four years ago that has done me great. Maybe I'll try to track it down and see if they still have that one."
5,Perfect! Sleeps wonderfully!,"I recieved this memory foam mattress topper early from the expected ship date. It was in new condition as stated, and it sleeps wonderful! The only thing I disliked is it had an odd smeel for about a week, but frebreeze fixed it! Great!"
2,"Don't buy the 3"" get a thinner one","While it will rebound once you are off of it, there will soon be a place where, when you lie down on it you will know its your ""spot"". It will be a place wher your body rolls into as it is not durable enough but won't show up when you are not on it. It will only take a month or two to be evident and then you will be disappointed."
5,very comfortable to sleep in,"Takes pressure off body when lying on it. At first when we opened it up, it seemed/looked like it was defective but the instructions said to let the foam re-expand for 24 hours, as it was compressed in a box for shipping. We did so and it did indeed expand and working fine. Would re-order again in the future. Good item for the price"
5,AWESOME!!!,This memory foam is WONDERFUL!!!! I bought this for a guest bed that has a terrible hard mattress as a last effort to try and avoid buying a new mattress. This foam saved the mattress. It is now the most comfortable bed in the house - totally worth the money. I think it is comparable to much higher priced memory foams and the quality and comfort level is outstanding.
1,Smells terrible,Had this now for 3 weeks and still trying to get rid of the chemical smell. Have tried Febreze twice and the chemical smell comes back after a couple of days. If it's in a enclosed room for a couple of days - the smells causes headaches. Have tried to contact customer service for help by email on what was listed in the packageing but it won't go through. Had high hopes with the memory foam but now very frustated and disapointed in Iowa.
5,Amazing!,"When I raved about how good this mattress topper was to my friends, they said write a review. Well here I am, Ms never-writes-reviews. It's wonderful, no more neck pain or back pains. I feel refreshed in the morning and the smell was pleasant to me, I thought of mint chocolate chip ice cream, go figure. It dissipated to a lesser degree now. Sigh. The price was excellent. I bought the mattress cover too. Buy it you won't be disappointed."
1,Like Sleeping on a Kitchen Sponge,"My recommendation - Do not buy this product under any circumstances unlessyou enjoy shipping 20 pounds of useless foam back to Amazon.This foam was a total disappointment. It provides no back support whatsoever and did not improve my existing mattress at all.Memory, what memory?? If elephants have great memories this product hasthe memory of a house fly.On a lighter note, Amazon did process the refund efficiently and contrary to some of the other reviews this product did not have an unpleasant odor upon arrival."
1,Quicksand,"I fully expected to love this, especially after reading reviews. Unfortunately, it's hard to roll over, it's hard to get up, it's hard to get out of. It's like quicksand. I hate it.I would not recommend it at all.The smell is not a factor though. I had no issues with smell, like some other reviewers said. It doesn't smell at all, straight out of the box. Maybe they made some improvements to that issue."
3,Hoping that second time is a charm...,"I have just ordered this a second time. The first time I ordered it, I bought a ""used"" one from the Amazon Warehouse Deals. I got the sled, but no skis. Luckily I had read the 1 review about the skis not being shipped and I called amazon right away and was able to get a refund. But I really want the sled and have had lots of luck in the past with Amazon, so I'm trying it again. This time I am ordering a new product. So here's to hoping I get the skis this time. I can't wait to use it. So, please Amazon, send me both parts of my order this time."
5,THIS IS AWESOME!!!!,"I went to the Sea of Faces tour last night with Kutless, Thousand Foot Krutch, FM Static, and FALLING UP. Falling Up was AMAZING live, and they are even better on their CD. I bought their CD at the concert and listened to it the first second possible. I haven't taken it out of my CD player since. If you've never heard Falling Up, you need to go out and buy or borrow this CD RIGHT NOW! It will be one of the best CD's you spend your money on EVER!"
5,HEAVENLY HOST,"I enjoy Donnie McClurkin's voice and music. I had the soundtrack and was very happy to beable to see the concert, it made me feel like I was really their. Thank You"
5,A Good Product!,It was a pretty good deal with a lower price than the market price and the shipping was free.
4,Good pressure cooker,"It is a good pressure cooker. I only have one complaint. The handle seems to loosen after using it several times. I had another one, and it did the same thing. I just tighten it. Presto is one of the best, but I think they should address the handle problem."
4,Great product but would buy the smaller version,"This is my first pressure cooker and I really like it. For this price, it is a good choice for those who aren't sure if they will use it much. It is especially useful for vegetarians. Beans that normally take 2 hours to simmer in a sauce pan are done in 20 minutes in the pressure cooker. I was afraid to use it at first but there are safety features which should make you comfortable using it. As long as it is under pressure, you cannot open the top.Although I do like this product, it is overly large for my needs. If you just plan on cooking a cup or two of beans at a time, I would recommend getting the 4 qt version of this product. Because the pressure cooker is so fast, there's really no need to make large batches of things."
4,Good purchase,"Great for cooking almost anything it was received faster than I expected as well, has not rusted and was dishwasher safe"
1,disappointed,"received the product within 3 days but with disappointment.I bought a new pressure cooker on line but received the product with scratches , wear and oily mark on handles and cooker body.returned it immediately."
2,Presto Pressure Cooker,Used this product only once but it worked out fine. Nice stainless steel finish. Will have to wait to see how it holds up. Good price and free shipping with Amazon.Bottom is solid . I was worried cause some reviews indicated a thin bottom.
2,Cheap Chinese Junk,"I have owned several pressure cookers in my time and wanted to get one for my daughter. I showed her how to use it (having read the specific instructions enclosed with the cooker) and wish I hadn't. It did not hold pressure at all, and the plastic top on the weight that I had set at the side of the stove while I browned the meat prior to cooking, melted.Another Cheap Chinese knock-off. Totally unworthy of the Presto brand."
5,Use it all the time,This is my third PC. I use it all the time. It is easy to use and I feel safe with it. The seals are a good design. Check the holes for safety and do not overfill
5,presto,Presto 307912 6-Quart Stainless Steel Pressure Cookerit works like a dream i have had one since the 60's and was lost without.everyone should have one. great for good quick meals
2,Not good for brown rice,"Well, it's a great price for a pressure cooker, but if you want to pressure cook rice or beans/legumes, this is not a good choice. The manual specifically states that you shouldn't cook those -- basically you shouldn't cook anything that might foam up and clog the pressure vent -- unless you use a foil-covered bowl inside the pressure cooker. Needless to say, that is a pain in several ways, and it severely reduces the volume you can cook. Plus the real deal-killer for me is that after trying it that way many times, brown rice *never* came out right.So if you plan to cook a lot of grains and beans, I suggest you spend more and get a Fagor or Kuhn Rikon. If not, I'm sure the many positive reviews here will confirm that this cooker works fine for meat and veggies."
5,Pressure Cooker,It does what I want it to do. Cooks the food properly and leaves all the taste I want.
5,Beautiful and shiny,"I just got this pot today, it has been my dream for a few months now to own this stainless steel pressure cooker. I have been wanting one and after I did my research I came up with this as the most reasonable aesthetically pleasing. It did not look too complicated like some of the others and did not look like it was difficult to clean. I have not put it together as yet but I will put in an update as soon as I have used it. I love stainless steel cookware and this presto stainless steel pressure cooker will definitely compliment my Cuisinart 10 piece pot set."
4,So far so good.,We use the pressure cooker at least 2-3 times a week. So far this one has done pretty well.The handle could be a bit more sturdy.
2,Presto poor quality.,"Used this pressure cooker and thought it was what I expected. On the third use I noticed a hole in the top were the over pressure plug should be , it fell out . Unable to find, so it's useless untill I order a new part. Yes it was hand washed . Checked bottom of unit and guess what.? Another product made in China! Thanks Presto."
1,Bad quality,"I bought one with a defect rubber gasket. When I contact their customer service, their response was slow and unreasonable. Don't like the product and service."
4,A GREAT pressure cooker - only one complaint.,"This is a really excellent item....but the little rubber safety button (to release pressure if something gets clogged) isn't as good as it could be. Every now and then, it releases the steam so no pressure can build up. If I jiggle it, to get it to set, it generally falls down into the kettle. At that point, I have to remove the lid, and fish the button out of whatever is in there -- easy if it's broccoli, but more of a problem if it's bean soup. I realize that this is my fault for not checking it each time, but with my old one (not nearly as good, overall) I never had to think about it. Remember, this is a GREAT pressure cooker -- I'm just kvetching."
5,Presto Stainless Steel Pressure Cooker,"This was purchased as a gift for my daughter. I have owned a Presto pressure cooker for years, but mine is aluminum, but I purchased this one for her, because she really likes stainless steel cookware. Hopefully she will enjoy hers as much as I do mine after many years of use. It makes the best beef stew ever."
5,very good,I use it almost 3 times a week. it can save you time and electronic bills. I am very rely on it. Love it so much!
4,great for the price,"This is a fantastic pressure cooker for the price. There are definitly new pressure cookers out that look fancier and have slightly better safety features (steam release valves instead of having to hyper cool the pan) but for what you're paying, this is a great pan. If you want to release the pressure but don't want to do an icebath, I've found it easier to just use tongs to tilt the release a little to the side to let out steam until the valves go down enough to open it. Perfect for 9 minute risotto!"
1,poor quality,"Please do NOT buy this pressure cooker. The lid had rust after the first time use. I don't think it stainless pressure cooker at all. When using this cooker, water was coming out from lid. It's the worst pressure I have used."
5,Quick Cooking,This is a real time saver for me. Size is a little big but performance is excellent. Would recommend with no hesitation.
1,Everything burns,"It's pretty and it cooks, but everything burns on the smallest of cooking flames. And it burns evenly across the bottom of the pot, so the heat-plate is distributing the heat. My ex-wife has possession of the fancy Italian pressure cooker which never burned anything. Sweet mysteries of life."
5,Exactly what I hoped for,This is a pressure cooker that comes with simple and easy to understand instructions on use. It is a great stainless steel weight. We are so please to have found this item and at a great price. It came quickly and we used it the first day with great success!
5,Great product,"I have had a 4 quart Presto stainless steel pressure cooker for 28 years and it is still going strong. I decided I needed a 6 quart for larger meals. Naturally, I bought another Presto."
5,great product,"I didn't think a 4 quart was big enough at first, but it is great for a small family.Makes it much easier to handle and pour from.I purchased this as a gift and it was just what my mother was looking for."
5,Fantastic!,This pressure cooker is the best! It's a 5-Star purchase for me! And the price was right! I told a friend about it and he bought one also!
3,Browning beef/brown rice cooking,"If beef is not browned before cooking, what is the harm?Why no brown rice cooking basket included with the 01341? I had to track down a 6"" pyrex bowl at WalMart, nothing else was suitable. One cup rice comes out best ever but so fills the bowl there's little room left for including beef or lentils with the rice. 1/4 cup lentils/1 cup rice almost overflows the bowl, PRESTO should supply a larger capacity basket so I don't waste time cooking rice, lentils and beef separately.The owner's manual suggests covering the bowl with aluminum foil. I am leery of having aluminum in contact with food at pressure cooking temps."
2,Stainless Steel Pressure Cooker but not nuts and bolts!,"I am pretty happy with the seller and the shipment. However the pressure cooker itself has some manufacturing issues. It was chromium plated and made of good quality material but the screws used to fit the handles are made of cheap material. All 6 screws have been started corroding within a month of usage. It is ridiculous to have such a low quality screws in so called high quality pressure cooker.I had to remove all handles again to clean the screws and oil them again but the oil won't last there due to high temperatures. It looks like I will need to do this painful cleaning job every month! Well, it is made in China!"
5,I love it.,It arrived on time. It is beautiful. It works and I love it. I use is it about 5 or 6 days a week. I am very happy with the purchase.There is some assembly required.
1,rusty screws..bad quality,"i had it for less than 2 years, however, the screws went rusty after few uses. In addition to that, the handles don't stay tight. The stainless steel inside doesn't shine at all even with intensive cleaning. bad quality that's why it is cheap"
5,Great live show!!!,This DVD is just awsome!! I hadn't heard of Underworld and a friend played this DVD - I was hooked. I've purchased this DVD and most of their CD's.
5,Do You Wanna Dance?!!,Five stars is not enough. I was not lucky enough to see Underworld live but this isn't bad at all. You are absolutely drawn into this. And if you're not moving one at least one part of your body after 10 minutes then check out cause you're probably six feet under. Also it contains a bonus cut of Kittens and Rowla.
1,Not impressed,"For the name you'd think this was a pretty nice pack n play, we're just waiting on a recall to be fullfiled on it now, a couple of the plastic joints have already cracked and been repaired, and over all it's fit and finish is just garbage, like the Kia of pack n plays.....don't waste your money, stick with Graco or another company of that sort that know what they are doing."
2,Disappointing,"I hate to give this case a bad rating, because I was really looking forward to getting it--but it's going to be mailed back on Monday. As I have experience with portable hardware (I'm an animator) I am very discriminating about cases. While this case is very pretty and the acrylic is very strong and can take scratches, it's not a very functional case. A good case should protect your hardware when it takes a fall. While this case protects well enough against scratches (and shows them very well) it has *no* insulation for shock absorption and the front cover pops off *very* easily. This means if you drop your Ipod, it'll be toast or it could get scratched up really nicely as it pops out of the case. It's a shame, because if Belkin made the top lock securely and added a thin layers of foams inside, it'd be perfect. I have a Case Logic case like that for my PSP and it rocks. Too bad nobody makes one like it for the Ipod."
4,Great Case,"I ordered this for my 5th generation 30g iPod. A couple days later I found my 6th generation 80g iPod I had lost months ago!When I got the case I figured it may just fit on the 5th gen and that it'd be too big for the 6th gen.Well after getting it, I tried it on both and it worked on both!So I'm keeping it on my 6th generation iPod!The cover looks even better in person and the scroll wheel cover gets about 80-90% use compared to no cover at all.The downside is that it doesn't seem as durable as i'd hope (it is plastic though) and the headphone jack may not be big enough for some headphones (fits regular iPod earbuds just fine though)."
5,"Difficult, but works","Without the warmup, it lasts about 40 minutes, and has three types of workout 1. Standing with a chair for balance, 2. Sitting, and 3. Lying down with heels on chair. There are lots of reps and the exercises are really hard, but if done with diligence and concentration can really produce results ie definition. One of the other reviewers mention it strains the knees, but I've had no problem with this (you have to really focus on putting weight on heels, not toes, so that knees don't go over the toeline). Also, I'd recommend doing this video AFTER doing abs work, so that the stomach is already taut and will support the body better while doing these exercises. I most definately recommend this video - its really effective. If you can get over the fact that its 40 minutes long and pretty difficult you'll really find that your legs feel firmer and more toned."
3,"Good Information, Maybe a Little Confusing","Great information, but unless you're well seasoned in psychology topics you will find yourself re-reading each page to understand it. I thought it was more of a marketing book than psychology, but nonetheless it's pretty good."
2,Good for beginners,"I didn't really see much that was dramatically new or different from things I already knew. I suspect this would make a good book for someone just starting RP'ing and needed some guidelines on how a particular class or race should act.Not all that useful for veteran players, possibly useful for DM's in developing some quick NPCs."
2,"New Players will benefit, but lacks depth...","This book is great for new players and idea generating. However, it lacks depth, focuses too heavily on fantasy cliches (the D&D core setting), and often provides characters with backgrounds they can't match due to limited skill selection. One variant this book should have included is how background can affect skill and feat selection. The book is pricey for its content."
5,2nd best Pay-per-view of year!!(besides Wrestlemania),"It was great austin vs. taker great match, HHH vs. Rock in my opinon an even better match!!! The rest of the matches were great too I can't wait to buy it!!!!!!!!"
3,Love those old movies,I first saw this movie when I was just a kid. Of course it was a big deal to me then because I was only about 7 or 8 years old. Well today im 52. I can tell you that I wasn't as crazy about like when I was a kid. But it was still fun to watch.
3,Ms Expression Suite,"Disappointed in overall product. The Web portion is improvement over FP (overall) The rest is still lacking. I see updat ($) to stay competative with the Adobe Design Suites which are , unfortunenly, vastly superior. and 2-3 times the price. MS, you let me down with this and Vista"
3,not exactly what I had in mind,The bed will fill my need for a spare bed but I am not fond of the outriggers on the long sides of the bed. I thought it had more of a frame system.
3,Decent quality for the price.,"The assembled stand is actually a fairly decent product for the price. You're getting something that is sturdy and compact enough that it doesn't take up too much space. You can put it in a corner, or against a wall and not worry about it taking up an entire room.The problem is with the assembly. The instructions that come with it are next to useless, and the way the hardware is just tossed in to a bag together with no labeling can create a problem if you're not used to putting things like this together.Overall, I would recommend this to someone that is looking for a decent and cheap stand, if you don't mind the headache of actually putting it together."
2,You Get What You Pay For.,"Positives:Easily assembled following included instructions in about 90 minutes.Materials seem like they will last.Negatives:Space between uprights is very narrow. I'm 6'2"" and 170lbs (aka bean pole), and I find the space between the uprights to be minimally acceptable.The base is not wide enough, nor heavy enough, to provide a safe feeling while doing dips... mine wobbles back-and-forth.The inner chin-up bars are too close to the back-rest making them worthless because my body is pressed into the back-rest while gripping them.The holes for the locking pins that hold the dip/ab handles in place do not line up quite right making it a pain in the rear to switch modes.Overall:I would not recommend this stand to a friend. It suffices for pull-ups, abs, and dips. It does not work for chin-ups. I do not always feel safe while using it."
3,half way decent product,"The station went together fairly easily, but I am pretty mechanically minded. while the pull up part of the station works well, the stand itself is a bit shakey for dips. the whole thing like vibrates and shakes while performing this exercise. otherwise, it is a good deal for the money."
5,Solid piece of equipment,This is a great addition to any home gym. The assembly went smoothly. The tower is built more for a man's frame - a little wider than my wife would like. However we've both been using it since the day it arrived!
3,Warm but not below freezing warm,They are warm but on a below freezing day my toes still got really cold. The name -40 below is very miss leading.
2,shrink factor sucks,"these socks shrank and i still cant were them am a female 8, very hard to put back on, don't buy."
2,Hi-tech is always the best???????????,"My interest in NN/GA started 3 years ago and I found this book. It covers some advanced methods for trading. But I am not sure whether they are really better than the traditional technical analysis. The results in this book could not prove it. And some authors didn't disclose their methods clearly. It seems to be very common among people who are using NN/GA/fuzzy logic in trading. So it is hard to know the reliability and accuracy of their results. And we cannot repeat their experiments. Personally, I won't use them in trading. I also gradually lose the interest in this area. I would like to know anyone really made profit by using them."
4,Learning about weather,I use this book when I teach first grade to talk about the properties of weather and storms. The kids love it and laugh at the animals. Very cute book.
2,disappointing,"Many of the accessories either didn't work with the LG 225, didn't work well, or broke shortly after we started to use them. I would not buy this accessory kit again."
4,Burke's Law's guests,As a lover of fine cars I wanted to see again Burke's Law and the Silver Cloud Rolls Royce that Gene Barry was always chauffeured in. I had forgotten by far all the famous guests who were on the shows. While the first season is in black and white and the plots may be corny there are many famous stars in the season and I found this to be very humorous. We have watched them all on bad weather days and enjoyed the clothes and the settings as much as the plots.
3,More limited than I expected,"I wanted to make fondant candies and there are NO recipes in this book. There's also no recipe for penuche. The truffle recipes look easy and good, and there's some good information on working with chocolate, but I was disappointed by it."
2,A Real Mishmash -- Look Elsewhere,"The CD starts out great. Tracks 1-7 are Brownie & Sonny at their finest. Then, beginning with Track 8, it devloves into an incomprehensible, badly produced collection of recordings that sound like they were taped in someone's living room. I suppose it might be worth the price for 7 great songs, but otherwise I would recommend you look elsewhere."
1,Many repeat songs,"This CD does have authentic Native American Indian Music but many of the songs just repeat with different titles. There are 2 songs that are copied 4 times each # 2,4,6,8 and 3,5,7,13 and 2 songs which are copied twice #15,17 and 9,12. Better bet for your money is Authentic Native American Music."
5,Best serious representational painting instruction today,"A modern master of representational painting enlightens the reader with insights into properly seeing and accurately rendering his or her subject. Lots of full color reproductions of Schmid's extremely solid, yet loose and painterly artwork back up every point he makes. Written in a friendly, down-to-earth manner, the book makes wonderfully good sense. The information is not new and does not promise false tricks or secrets, but is such a wealth of time-tested methods that it is an ideal resource for every serious representational painter."
1,Go to the artist's website,"The book itself is great, but DO NOT PAY THESE RIDICULOUS PRICES for a used copy of this book.You can get a new copy for $95 (hardback) or $45 (paperback) at Richard Schmid's website."
4,Conversational and thorough,Written as though you are in a lesson with the author who is an excellent teacher who really loves his subject
1,Alla Prima - what a disappointment!,"First off, I can't believe that I payed more than US$140 for this book, especially when it only 204 pages, with 118 plates - I feel like I've been taken advantage of. There is no dobut that Richard Schmid is an excellent painter but I fail to see why this book has had such rave reviews over the years. The advice that you get in this book is no better than I had during my 1st year of art school and for the price tag that this book commands I expected a whole lot more. My advice is to have a good look at this book before you consider buying it. Me, I think it's a total waste of money and I can't recommend it, unless you have money to burn."
3,Felt like the book abruptly stopped,"I liked the format of the book - intertwining lots of character's lives into one tale. They reminded me of Jan Karon books but with more bible quotes. I did think the reporter was a useless character and each time his chapter would appear, I would be highly annoyed.But, I was reading and it felt like the ending just dropped off. I expected more story/the next chapter and it went into recipes. I didn't realize until just right this minute that it was a series. Knowing that, I am on the fence about continuing. If they were free or significantly reduced, I would keep reading but I would not pay full price to keep reading.It was mostly enjoyable and better yet, I got it free."
2,The Potluck Club,"All of the members of my Christian book club were disappointed in this book--not well written, inspirational or even very enjoyable."
3,Monterey Jazz Festival 1975 Review,"This is a nice DVD, while one that was not up to snuff in my honest opinion. I am an old jazz man, and these little short snippets of performances were not all that good. I want to hear the performer get into the music. . .listening to a couple of notes - short segments of a song - and then rolling onto someone else was not that interesting and I found it quite annoying and unenjoyable. While I liked all the artists listed, not one of them got the chance to stretch out and really give me something worth listening too or watching. Also while the show is an old one (1975) I was really disappointed in the camera positions, editing (takes), etc. I wasn't that taken with the performances, but at least it's in my collection."
2,Ben 10: Alien Force Volume 10,"Received the DVD a day sooner then the expected arrival date, so that was cool; however the case that the DVD came in was shipped to me with the plastic slightly opened and with a deep puncture mark in the case. The DVD itself was undamaged but I'm picky about these things so that was a bit of an annoyance."
1,Not the best book to start with,"I today recived my copy of ""THE BIBLE"", this is not a book for people starting out with ASP. The book is full of massive ERRORS, and I`m really supprised the author let this book go to market. I feel as a personal choice the author for all he suggests he has a MCSD goes on a further course for proof reading. The 2 best books on the market for ASP are, Sams Active Server Pages 3.0 and Sams E-Commerce Programming in 21 days. So do yourself a favour and give this a total miss."
2,Major disappointment,"This collection was a major let-down after such an amazing first 2 seasons.Everything seemed to draw out forever to delivery very little pay-off for such tedious development. Only 2 of the 13 episodes measure up to the consistency of S1 and S2: the opener - and which ever ends disc 3. The rest are nothing more than ho-hum filler. I'm not alone here: 7 of us waited with baited breath for S3 - and we watched all 13 in 2 sessions. The consensus was unanimous... this collection is a major yawn and nothing close to what we hoped for or expected. Hopefully S4 will be somewhat redemptive... though, from those who saw it on TV, we're not banking on it. Too bad, so sad."
5,MagnificientPull,"Very learning experience regarding funeral homes and their systems. Like the way a death occurs at the very begining of each episode, the way it is carried out throughout the episode. The acting is very good and especial love the two brothers. Nate is my nomination for best actor in the movie. Very handsome man, I must say."
5,A GREAT AND DIFFERENT SEASON,"I DIDN'T LIKE SEASON THREE WHEN I FIRST WATCHED IT A FEW YEARS BACK ON HBO - I THOUGHT IT WAS RATHER SLOW MOVING AND SUCH A DEPARTURE FROM SEASONS 1 AND 2, BUT AFTER WATCHING IT AGAIN NIGHTLY ON HBO, I FIND IT A FASINATING PORTRAIT OF PEOPLE IN CHANGE. TRUE, THE CHARMING HUMOR AND ODDNESS OF THE FIRST TWO SEASONS ARE GONE, BUT THE SUBTLE STORYLINES AND A PLUS ACTING MORE THAN MAKE UP FOR IT. THE FINAL EPISODE IS A GEM."
2,Six Feet Under 3rd season,Slightly flawed. This is the second time this hashappened (not the same seller). Will only buynew from now on.
3,The Hard Corps,"Jean Claude Van Damme plays an ex-soldier who takes a job as a bodyguard for an ex-boxer and businessman who is threatened by a rap artist who has just been released from prison.While this is not a great movie, not as good as ""In Hell"", it's entertaining enough and a step up from Van Damme's previous movie, ""Second in Command"". Van Damme fans should enjoy it."
1,"""Old Target"" ""Kitty Heart""","I really enjoyed Jean-Claude's earlier films. But, they keep seeming to get worse and worse. The dude kicked like 3 times in the film. The best part of Jean-Claude's films are the fight scenes and these sucked. You know you are getting cheese whenever you watch any of his movies but instead of cheedar this was some moldy government crap! I'm really hoping he'll get with Steven Segal talk about how much they both suck, watch their old movies and then go back to thier roots!"
1,A TOTAL DISGRACE TO THE EC COMICS LEGENDS!,"William Gaines must be rolling around in his grave. Shame, shame...AVOID THIS!"
5,Excellent Book,This book touched me in more ways than one. It was very enlightening and will be a resource I share with my own counseling clients in the future. It allowed me to see that I can be grateful for my suffering.
5,Interesting Read!,I found this book years ago at the public library and just picked it up for the second time...very engrossing book even for those not typically into history books.
5,budding screenwriters take note!,"If your serious about the craft of screenwriting, you must pick up this book. It has a plethora of useful information on all sorts of screenwriting tasks. Basically, read some background info on screenwriting, fill out some worksheets and save as a useful tool for when you do write your screenplay. It's amazingly simple - and highly effective. It's my new favorite book!"
1,"Yes, beware!","Do not order this item, if you want a DVD player with a 5 inch screen. This item is not as pictured. You will receive a small orange colored player with a 3.5 inch screen."
1,RUINED MY MAC MINI!!!,"These DVDs have a funky copy protection that caused the disc to get stuck in my mac mini. As of yet, I have not been able to remove it. I don't want to force it out or have to pay for something because of this manufacturer's stupidity. It is definitely copy protected because when I tried to play it on Windows, it refused due to copyright issues. I was only trying to play it on my PC! I wasn't even copying it. If you plan on watching it on your computer, forget about it... it won't work. Not even on Media Center. For copy protection alone I have to rate this set at the lowest setting. If I was able to play the discs, I would give a decent recent but the protection has rendered both the discs and my computer useless!"
1,WHAT A GYP!!! ONLY BUY IF YOU ENJOY BEING DISSAPOINTED,"i have always been a HUGE fan of Lynch's work and couldn't wait for Twin Peaks to be released on DVD but on getting the box set, what do I find? The 90-minute pilot is MISSING so unless you've already seen the series previously or have no sense of continuity, then a huge chunk of the plot, the fun, the atmosphere is missing.sure, a summary is included with the box set, but why not save yourself ($$$) and just find an online review of the whole series and read that instead? Artisan seem to think that a summary is enough for how it all began, so why bother yourself by watching the rest of it?Wouldn't have been soooooooo upset if the packaging had at least give some clue to the absence but no, it quite clearly states THE FIRST SEASON.the technical quality of the set, however, is great - the commentaries and additional features are brilliant, but i would happily have swapped them for the FIRST EPISODE."
3,First Season Minus Pilot Equals Three Stars,"David Lynch is my favorite director and this is a great show. But this box set is missing the 2 hour pilot episode. That's the episode that sets up the story and introduces the characters. This box set begins with the second episode. Sorry, but that's an incomplete box set and you'll have to buy an import dvd to get the first episode, or watch an old vhs copy. Buyer beware: this isn't the entire ""first season.""Additional Note: I've purchased the region free import DVD from China, the running time is shorter than when originally aired on tv. This is because the transfer was slightly speeded up to make the shorter running time so some of the voices will sound higher pitched. That said, it's the only DVD version I know of. My best bet for the pilot episode is still the VHS ""movie"" version from Warner Bros--just make sure to stop it before where the original pilot ended and skip the tacked on ending."
5,I want to buy it all!,"So... now that the second season is finally being released on DVD, the first season isn't available new anymore? What's the deal with that? Obviously I shouldn'tve waited to buy the first season, but getting the first season wasn't as big a priority when I knew I'd have to wait for the second. I really hope they manufacture some more!"
1,Totally misleading- where is the... pilot episode?!,"First, let me say how excited I was to see this DVD available- I remember loving Twin Peaks but clearly could not remember the content of the series. I was excited to see ""episode I"" which I (wrongly) assumed would be the pilot and would refresh my memory. I thought my disc was defective when I kept seeing and hearing ""previously on Twin Peaks....""How can a disc which is advertized as ""the complete first season"" not include the pilot? How ridiculous! I am...buying the pilot... but... 1 star for deceptive marketing and advertizing."
2,2 stars only because this is Twin Peaks,"I can tell you right now that if this set included all 29 (?) episodes along with the pilot, I would give it a 6. But what are they trying to pull here? Do your research, get the rights, and make this a set worth owning - for under $300. It would have sold like mad. All this does is twart other TP productions by showing bad profit to other companies who may have been interested in producing something TP or Lynch related. If you buy this, you are a fool. My advice: buy the VHS set, wait a year or two til you've got yourself a DVD burner, and convert them yourself. Concidering how long it took them to put out this subpar set, you have nothing to lose. You'll have the set on DVD sooner than 2020 and, burner included, it will cost you less. It may even be better quality and on fewer discs. I don't know what I was expecting here. Wait, yes, I do. I was expecting this. I was hoping for a lot more."
2,Twin Peaks - The First Season (Special Edition) DVD,I was unhappy with this version. Too many scenes were deleted from the original episodes. I higly recommend VHS.
1,Another Common DVD Ploy,"As previous reviews have noted, the pilot is missing from this DVD set. However, I disagree with other commentators who have called it ""curious"" and ""an oversight."" It is neither. It is an obvious ploy whereby in one or two years a ""SUPER Special Platinum Premium Edition"" will be released. It will include the pilot. You will then have to buy the ""new"" set and spend another $50.Then again, I could be wrong.In any case, I'm a sucker and will still buy this set on the off chance that the extra DVD material has managed to add to the list of synonyms for ""creepy"" and ""mysterious"" that abound in Twin Peaks commentaries."
3,Where's the Pilot?,"Twin Peaks is a great show, and I cannot add any unique praise. But where the heck is the Pilot? Episode one of the DVD starts out ""...previously on Twin Peaks..."" The creators of this set really missed the mark by omitting the pilot. Also, a good navigable menu is really nice, but this one is not designed well. I'm sure we will watch it over and over, nonetheless. So 5 stars for an interesting show and 1 star for the DVD itself."
4,David Lynch at his best.......,"David Lynch's Twin Peaks is one of the best thiller series ever to air on TV. With Lynch's dark look into a town filled with adultry, lies, sercrets, and murder. Kyle MacLachlan plays one of his greatest roles as FBI special agent Dale Cooper. Agent Cooper uses his unusually methods to find the killer of the girl everyone loved. Sara Palmer is found dead on the shore in twin peaks. Suddenly everyone is hidding somthing from someone else. Nobody trusts anyone in the small little town and the death of a loved one becomes a can of worms for everyone.Set aside time for this series because you can't only watch one!"
3,Lacking,"I love the show and can't wait for the DVD to come out, but why no pilot and no commentary by Lynch? Without these things, it almost makes the DVD set pointless. Nonetheless, episodes 1-7 are very good and I'm happy they are on DVD."
5,Pilot movie owned by another production company,"For those of you who wondered why the pilot was not a part of this release, the pilot is owned by another production company. Hopefully, the pilot will be released some day...With or without the pilot, the first season of Twin Peaks is excellent. The DVDs are so crystal clear and the sound is great (5.1 DTS). You can really appreciate the ones directed by Lynch. They are outstanding."
3,breakout,"Have read most Parker novels by Richard Stark, the most recent novels have not been up to the same standard as his earlier series, but they are nevertheless still entertaining for light reading. Amazon gives enough information on the sample to give an idea about the story."
4,Another winner from the King of Noir,"When a hot-dogging associate causes Parker's arrest, things look bad for the old heister. He finds himself in prison with virtually no chance of release. Of course, there's always another way out, if you can manage it. And managing things is what Parker does best.His breakout and subsequent jewelry job are the meat and potatoes of this excellent noir thriller. Stark renders the details of Parker's life and crimes in appropriately rapid-fire, austere, and even bleak prose. Stark makes this kind of writing look easy to do, but very few others can pull it off with nearly the skill that he does.Despite the somewhat slim profile of this book, there is a lot of story here. Stark has the ability to craft prose that is concise and compact, but packs quite a punch. You won't feel cheated after having read Breakout. In fact, you might just break out in applause!Reviewed by David Montgomery, Mystery Ink"
1,who is this ham writing about hem?,"the first thing that comes to mind is pure trash, worse than the kind found in your average tabloids... the second thing is what nerve this guy has in ape-ing hemingway's voice... the third and last thing that enters my mind is the amount of false self-promotion on the cover and the poor, disjointed storytelling that follows inside... bleck, bleck, bleck! so sorry my son bought it"
2,Disappointed,"First time I read a book from this author more than a decade ago and I remembered his authentic and original ideas. This time I was greatly disappointed. The book is fragmented, incoherent. Various ideas and disconnected parts follow each other with threads pointing nowhere. I did not bother to finish it."
3,It's just OK for me,"I bought this CD because I like to work out to upbeat music and this CD was recommended to me. So, I bought it having only heard one song from it. Most of the tracks are rather short and truthfully that annoyed me. I should have done more research before blindly buying this. Overall, I do like the CD, but I won't purchase anymore of the ones in the series."
1,A very shallow presentation,"The authors spend a great deal of time (and many pages) going over XML under the guise of preparing the reader to understand the underpinnings of BizTalk. In reality, they're clearly just filling out the book.They then touch upon BizTalk itself in as shallow a manner as possible, after which they switch to talking about the BackOffice 2000 offerings that will interact with the BizTalk Server.Again, the BackOffice products are covered with incredible shallowness.The case study at the end is more of the same - basically, the user wanted openness and flexibility, so they used XML and BizTalk. Again, no real details.Unfortunately, there is very little out yet about the BizTalk server. Even so, only the most uniformed managers will learn much new from this book. ...."
5,Works flawlessly,There is not much to say except it works perfectly. And I tend to just yank out my keys and take it for granted that Windows knows it is removable device and therefore disables write-behind caching (a technique that keeps a small amount of data in a cache prior to writing it to the disk) as it might for a regular drive.
3,Minnow trap,I would recomend this trap. On the first day of use i caught about 11 baitfish. The reason I only gave it 3 stars is because it's cheaply made. On the first day of use the zipper fell off. the best way to use this trap is to let the bait float around in the trap instead of putting it in the bait bag. Use mackeral and bits of shrimp as bait.
2,Horrible taste,"I tried it in water and juice, I cannot make myself drink this stuff. Still trying to figure out a way to take this."
5,Everybody Loves Raymond Season 3,"Dvds excellent, timescale and cost more expensive than ordering via Amazon.co.uk, so will be ordering future ones from that site instead"
3,Useful but not forceful,"This is a very useful book in that it gives you stepby step advice on how to negotiate with teachersin order to reduce the amount of homework your child gets.I wish the authors had been more strident in theiropposition to homework,because even with all thegood advice in this book parents will need all theencouragement they can find in the good fight againsthomework. DOWN WITH HOMEWORK!"
2,not what i expected,"This fois gras was not what i expected. Having had FG in many restaurants i decided to try package now that it is banned in CA.This item tastes and smells like ""pate"". northing ilke restaurant versions. If u like pate u will love this. i don't. if u want restaurant style keep looking"
5,Original y espectacular,"Este album es para los fanaticos de la timba fuerte. El disco tiene el sabor conocido de Los Van Van, pero yo diria que a distincion de otros albumes, este es mas furioso. Samuel Formell(bateria/timbal) le da un estilo distinto, differente, y muy agresivo al ritmo que jamas he escuchado. Esto es lo que hace que este disgo valga el dinero que piden y mas.Ademas de eso la introduccion de la primera mujer vocalista le da un sabor distinto.Una cosa. El otro escritor dijo que Mayito Rivera imitaba a un cantante de Flamenco, esto es incorrecto. Diego ""El Cigala"" canta el tema ""Te Recordaremos""."
3,Meh,"It's a decent effort, but nothing is very exiting. It's hard to sit through without wanting to hit the stop button."
3,Super Joe...?,"One element that I've always loved about Joe's music is that it always painted beautiful scenery in my head and touched my soul in the deepest of ways whenever and wherever I listened to it. Unfortunatly, Supercolossal does just seem to follow a formula and seems lukewarm: no emotion, & no soul! Crystal Planet and some before and after it had feeling & emotion, what happened to it all on this one?"
3,Expected Better,"After reading ""Devil Takes a Bride"", I was expecting great things from Alex & Becky's story . . . sorry, I was disappointed. I was really wondering if Gaelen Foley had hired a ghost writer here. The story was lacking the exciting danger & suspense from her previous novels and seemed silly in places. The sensual scenes, as previous reviewers said, were overdone and I had to skim over long descriptions to finally get to the end. I have really enjoyed all of the previous ""Knight"" stories and hope that Jack's will live up to what we have come to enjoy with Gaelen Foley's writing skills. Not a keeper, will probably dump in trash can."
3,MS Expression Web,"If you have been using FrontPage, don't expect an easy conversion. You will miss things like the navigation (tree) function and automatic navigation bar (links) function. The idea of better web pages is what I wanted, but it's going to be a long time before I'm comfortable with this program."
4,Good introduction,"I practised Yoga for a few months before buying this DVD. I like it because all 12 postures are very well presented. My 4-year daugther likes it even more and can do most postures. It is a little bit long (40 minutes), haven't got time to watch it everyday."
4,Good for getting started with Yoga,"I purchased this DVD to try and understand what all the Yoga hype was about. I found the instructions easy to follow, a little slow at times, but overall presented very well. For anyone with back injuries, this is a great way to relax your muscles and mind."
5,The Best intro to yoga,"This is about the 10th time I've bought this dvd. I keep giving them to friends and family. It's that good! especially if you are out of shape. When I first used it several years ago I could not reach much past my knees I was so stiff and out of shape . After a month of just doing it with the tape once a day I could wrap my hands around my feet and within 3 months I became aware my posture and breathing were so much better, and of course your flexibility. This dvd is great for anybody who is out of shape and doesn't know where to start. Sara Ivanhoe is the best instructor. I'm not sure if it's her voice or the relaxed tempo, but she makes you understand what yoga is about."
4,Yoga for anyone!,"I am more than 100 pounds overweight. In my desire to get into shape, I was searching for a gentle program to help me stretch and maintain flexibility. This DVD is perfect - the basic workout is slow paced, with plenty of instruction. If I can do it, anyone can! There is also an intermediate program that will challenge you and get the sweat going, as it is faster paced. I love it!"
5,Hot Wet Guide to NYC,"Here's a book that splays it all out for you - the Big Apple's raunchiest, funniest, artiest erotica. I was amazed to find everything from the standard strip clubs to things like tempest wrestling, erotic artists, cool boutiques for toys that don't scream ""sleeze""...and it was witty, approachable and honest...i gigled over it with girlfriends and bookmarked some pages for my next lucky paramour...and i am in the city, so i actually checked out some of these places...acurate down to the pasties..."
4,Schell delivers...,"Schell is a sensitive observer of events. Schell is putting his undergraduate training in Chinese to good use. I am the process of comparing works by Bernstein, Butterfield, Fraser, and Schell, and I have been impressed with Schell's works so far. Mandate is fairly meaty, full of first-hand observations and post-op reflections. Overall, a very good job"
2,so this is literature . . .,"Gentlemen, I am not impressed. I understand that Russians worship Pushkin as the be-all and end-all of their literary language, assigning him much the same significance as we do to Shakespeare or Germans, Goethe. If Pushkin is the best they have to offer, they'd better do some serious searching: perhaps a contest for a $10 prize would ferret out something deeper. True, Pushkin is a decent writer--and I recognize that, having a very sketchy command of Russian and not having read his prose in the Russian original, I cannot begin to capture a fair idea of what he actually sounds like--but I was utterly underwhelmed. And I gave the man a fair whirl: I read his complete tales of Belkin (of which, to be fair, The Undertaker was a reasonably funny stint) and a supposedly entertaining novella, The Captain's Daughter. I have been exposed to a wide array of Russian writers--some titanic, some less known, some quite obscure--and I have yet to find cause to jump up and down. Sorry."
3,A Brutally Honest Film,"This movie explores some of the pitfalls of not only homosexuality and coming out, but also coming to terms with sexual freedom and exploration. There are many moments that are just so brutally true that for some people they might hit a little bit too close to home. The theme of this movie is that you are not alone in your confusion. I wish I had seen this movie when I was younger, because I had nobody to guide me through those tough times.Some moments forced a little too much emotion for plot purposes, but otherwise this is an enjoyable film."
2,"Mediocre but Somewhat Accurate, Worst Digital Transfer Ever","I found the story accurate in the telling of how guys can mostly be just after the sex with no interest in the person; it happened to me for a long time. The makeup and outfits were a bit over the top for someone just coming out.The biggest problem I had with the DVD is that it is basically unwatchable due to the worst digital transfer I've ever come across. The picture begins to pixilate less than half-way through the film. Shortly after, the sound begins to fall out. After the loss of sound, the D/A converter becomes so overwhelmed with the jumble of data that everything freezes with no way out except to stop the disc. Somehow I was able to fast-forward past the frozen spot, but it froze again less than a minute later, with the pixilation happening the whole time. As a result, I can say I've never really seen the entire film due this mess of a transfer."
4,Very sweet and entertaining,Edge of Seventeen is a very enjoyable movie. I found myself rewatching it over and over again. Theres nothing to spectacular about it. Its just a typical coming out and coming to terms movie. I just found that the main character is very sweet and charming in a innocent way. The plot was very st8 foward and basic with a few little tid bits to living it up. The film was made in the 80s and is a bit dated. But if you just want to see a decent film concerning the gay lifestyle or coming out this definatly buy this film. You wont be dissapointed.
2,Mediocre gay teen flick with a couple good actors,"Maybe its because I am not far enough away from the edge of seventeen myself, but I really wasn't compelled to continue watching this movie afer the first twenty minutes. I was a little interested in seeing what it was like to be gay when I was a baby, but for the most part, I found the film to lack luster and...well...lame. It was trite in the manner in which it delivered its message. ""Edge"" was almost trying to be the American answer to ""Beautiful Thing"", but wasn't. It had its moments, however. The lead boy gave a solid performance. The script was sprinkled with laughter inducing lines (but no belly laughs here). My advice: ""Beutiful Thing"", ""Trick"", and ""Lilies"" are much more worthy of being in your dvd/video collection."
3,Not very interesting,"Ellen is sick and is sent to her grandmother's house. She discovers the diaries of her great grand mother and reading them, she becomes convinced that she knew a vampire.I was disappointed by this book. The story wasn't too bad, it just never captivated me."
4,"Rageful kids, mean rageful adults",This is another book that covers the general symptoms of rageful kids in an easy to read format. It covers the basic needs of these hateful kids and how to get them where they need to be. I like that the author has been where you are.It is not too much different than his other book about raising impossible children. Either one is good to give to others to help them understand... because those others frequently are the ones helping you but unwittingly are also making your life more miserable.Acountability seemed to me to be the main message of the book.Learn to be real and you will get what you want . Continue to be fake and angry and you end up with nothing. If only all the care givers could follow the same pathway.
4,But now they are found,"This is a compilation of TMBG rarities that were previously only released online, on singles or on the McSweeney's bonus cd. Almost all of the tracks are excellent (with the exception of the McSweeney's tracks which just sound odd and out of place). TMBG's patented sense of humor is rampant throughout (""Words Are Like"" and ""Disappointing Show"" will have you laughing out loud) and many of the tracks are real rockers. Now, there are some songs on here most TMBG fans are already sure to have (the tracks from the ""Working Undercover For The Man"" EP, ""Token Back To Brooklyn"" which was a hidden track on ""Factory Showroom"" and ""Oranges"" which was a hidden track on ""No!"") but the album works so well on a whole that it doesn't really matter. Ironically, the album's weakest track is the title track which is long and boring and doesn't hold a candle to the previously released live version from ""Severe Tire Damage""."
5,Some of the best LOST songs i've enjoyed....,"I was expecting some stinkers in this bunch and had a cdr prepped to take off the bogus tracks or tracks i just found useless. Of course, TMBG tends to make HIGh quality fun music and this lost collection is more of the same with nothing i'd deem bad at all. This isn't to say this album should be bought instead of the albums proper...BUT it is a great collection of unissued pieces of work. I'm especially fond of disappointing show which features Joseph Stalin on the drums from what i'm told....."
2,The recipes are bland.,"I'm no expert like my mom when it comes to cooking Pilipino food. However, I used this a recipe book only a handful of times because the flavoring of the food is so bland. Granted that the recipes are a healthier version of the usual Pilipino-fare but it sacrifices taste for many of the recipes ... in some cases the dishes are made so simple that it doesn't even resemble the true Pilipino dish. Amazon offers better recipe books - try those first."
4,eat or die,man this book is so cool. basics are there and has been passed around my work for the longest time. Everyone seems to like it.
3,"'Psychedelic Underground, Volume 1' (Garden Of Delights) Various Artists - 3 1/2 stars","Fifteen track collection of six different sub-underground unknown psychedelic / progressive bands. Most, if not all the bands here likely only released a 7"" vinyl single or two (if that many). Time stamp on these undiscovered gems are between 1971-73. Ensemble here that I liked hearing the most were the couple of songs from the 'heavy progressive' Dom (not the obscure band that released the in-demand rarity 'Edge Of Time'), Pax Vobis and the Blues Ltd. Just as good as the 'Psychedelic Gems, Volume 4' - the only other title I have from this limited edition Garden Of Delights pressing."
5,Handy Resource,This book is perfect for quick reference yet thorough enough to be a companion to a textbook on research. Worth its weight in gold!
5,Tablets are amazing!,"I bought these @ my Sports Chalet store because they were on sale/cheaper plus I needed them right away. My hydration pack has stagnant water in it after I forgot to clean it out when I went on vacation for a week. I tried cleaning it out by using a toothbrush and liquid dish soap and hot water but it did not clean the hydration pack as well as I had hopes it would. I ran to the store and bought these and followed the directions and I was very very surprised at how well they worked. Not only did they do get rid of the smell, they actually made my hydration bladder look cleaner too! Great product and I am very happy with these little magical tabs!"
3,ok,"these are probably best for take along camping or cycling, if you have plenty of clean water to rinse. otherwise, at home some water and a few drops of bleach and rinse well. best to not let you reservior get to grimy in the first place."
3,The movies are excellent.....BUT,"The 15 movies are excellent quality...both in story and quality of reproduction, but Hoppy movies were always a cut above the rest of the westerns of that era. My complaint is with the packaging. I ordered directly from Amazon and Amazon shows a picture of the lunch box with the 3 included discs in cases...mine didn't come that way. There was a cardboard insert inside the lunch box and each disc was in a slot of the insert. The discs were not even in envelopes. Naturally the discs had dislodged and were flopping around inside the lunchbox...and this was a brand new, shrink-wrapped product. Two of my discs are scratched badly, but at least they play OK. Don't expect to get what you see in Amazon's picture."
1,HOPALONG CASSIDY,"This is not a review. Actually i'm trying to find out the movie titles on this 3 disc set from Platinum which was released on July 22. Amazon doesn't list them! Can someone help me? Thanks, David"
4,Great place for a beginner to start,"I am a middle-aged woman (smile) who has decided that adding some weight-training to her exercise program would be a good idea. I purchased this and have followed the routine three times. I'm already beginning to see results. This is a good program for a beginner. Good direction, sound, pacing. I really like this."
1,"Ok for novices, but gets boring QUICK","This video did a good job explaining the correct postures and positions for weight training. But it didn't explain about breathing until halfway through the video. Also, it was way too long for just 12 excercises, and I found myself fast forwarding through a lot of it the first time I watched it. I can't imagine using it more that twice (just to get used to the posture)."
4,Great Speaker for the price,This makes a great replacement subwoofer for the Explorer. It sounds great and does the job it was supposed to.
4,Great for rap and rock,"I just got mine today. I replaced 2 JL audio 8inch W6 with this 1 sub in the same enclosure,and it goes lower and louder.I've had the JLW6 for 6yrs and the foam has cracked on both subs. They were not in direct sunlight..I'm not pushing a lot of power,so I'm not sure what the deal was. JL's are supposedly great quality speakers.Okay now the JBL. Compared to my 2 JL's this thing gives unbelievable lows for it's size. If you like rap and rock you'll love this sub.Its very efficient, loves to play loud. However, when the volume comes down and you want to listen to say jazz or gospel its not as awesome. Hence the 4 stars. It doesn't seem as accurate as the JL's. You can tighten up the sound by putting more filler the box but you can hear...their not as happy. The extreme excursion sounds like overkill with a mellow genre of music. For rap,r&b;,rock,reggae those digital sub lows...THIS SUBS FOR YOU. :)"
5,Best Region Free DVD Player in Market,"This dvd player has all the features I needed to play the region 2 dvd's from the United Kingdom. I can't say more than ""This player will play any dvd's you can find in the world"" Best PAL to NTSC Picture Conversion A+++"
1,"I HOPE YOU GET WHAT THEY SELL, NOT WHAT I GOT","I bought a REGION FREE, NTSC and PAL capable dvd player, as says here on thin web site, but what i got was a ZONE 1, NTSC only DVD player with exactly the same brand and model number as the one described on this website.... and needless to say.... it was absolutely useless for me.... i already have a zone 1 ntsc dvd, so what is the use of another..... oh, It plays DIVX movies and that's great, but it wasnt what i bought, and i have sent two comunications to customer service that havent been answered.Im an avid customer of amazon, and i buy very often..... i have loved the service until now."
3,Interesting but flawed,"Very interesting history of the major calendar systems used around the world, both in the present day and in the past. It also gets into the mathematics of how to convert between calendar systems, including algorithms suitable for computer programming. Unfortunately, there are numerous typographical errors in the narrative and in the algorithms! The word ""temperature"" where the author clearly meant ""temperate"", substitution of ""*"" for ""-"" in a formula, etc. So far, I have been able to correct the formula for computing the day of the week and the formula for computing the date of Easter. I'm not looking forward to tackling the other algorithms. Did anyone proofread this before it was printed? Maybe the publisher could put up an errata sheet on their web site.Good for the history, but be prepared to do some algebra if you want to use the algorithms."
1,"Slow as Molasses on a Hot, Steamy Virginia Day","Really, I don't want to waste time on this review. I have read many, many books on Jefferson, most memorably, the latest by Annette Gordon-Reid- 'The Heminges"". I expected such great things from such an interesting guy such as Burstein. This book was laborious, repetitive, and frankly, I couldn't understand half of it! It just kept going on and on. Really, any good tidbits on Jeffersons feelings, daily life are enough to keep me satisfied. Burstein made every one of them a federal case!"
3,Useful for the beginner,"This book is great for the beginning investor who is just starting out and considering his or her investment options. It explains the basics in clear language and defines key terms. However, if you are a novice or experienced investor and want more advanced guides to making investment decisions, look elsewhere."
2,Lint trap,The lint trap or filter was not what was described in the amazon write up. Directions were so small you needed a magnifying glass to read it.
2,Didn't find out its not for drain stacks till I got it!,The first thing I saw when opened was that this filter was not to be used for in drain pipes. This never was mentioned in the description unless I missed it.I ordered the nylon mesh lint trap as a back up and ended up using it which was less than half the price.
5,I read the reviews and it is a very good product and works very well,I read the reviews and it is a very good product and works very well
4,great stove,"I had beans on one burner and rice on the other, and both cooked perfectly. Very nice stove, easy to clean, easy to use."
1,Longhorns Fan,"This item was reccomended to me yet I am a longhorns fan. Oh well I will admit they had a good strong season, but when push came to shove they choked."
4,Short and sweet,Nice basic book don't waste money on don't shoot the dog but you could get same info free on google
3,snapping your fingers,is the same. but the premis behind this book is great. I've read it cover to cover and the damn dog will attest the clickers are pretty tasty just hard to swallow.
4,Router bit set review,"The router bits themselves are of good quality. The carrying case leaves a bit to be desired though. The foam inserts that hold the bits had all come loose during shipping and most of the labels were no longer where they should be. Minor issues. In general, a good product."
3,Good for a Light Fantasy Read,"This is the first book in the ""Wizard and Dragon"" duology which is a prequel to the ""Pelman the Powershaper"" trilogy. I can never really decide if I like these books or not. Sometimes the narration is witty and humorous and the plot is fairly original and at other times the dialogue (inner and between characters) is very forced and the plot predictable and contrived. Good for a light read, but don't set your expectations too high."
5,If you Love Pits and Hate Animal Testing This Book Is For You!!,"This book is one of the best book i have ever read. considering i love pit bulls and think animal testing should be out lawed this book made me cry and laugh simply for the fact that Diane caught the pit bull personality so perfect. She told some of the things that most people would not know such as peta supports the banning of pit bulls and that pit bulls no matter what they are forced to go though have the ability to recover it's a heart warming story and a great depiction of what really happens to all those dog and cats used for so called ""animal research"" or as i call it the needless killing of animals. i am a junior in high school and any one trying to get a feel for pit bulls and animal testing should read this book it was one of the best i have ever read."
2,Broken!!,"Candle was great, smelled good and burns well. Packing job was bad and product arrived broken. fortunately, it wasn't smashed, so candle could be removed."
1,I learned nothing,"The author does a good job expressing her difficulty in being a Jew and a Buddhist, and then tries to squeeze in a few ideas that try to bring the two together. I have studied Judaism for many years and I can say that she doesn't really know much about Authentic Judaism all she knows is what a Jew is in the modern western world, but that is not true Judaism.True authentic Judaism doesn't have to be forced into symmetry with Buddhism, it is readily apparent how both traditions come from the same source and flow beautifully together. What is needed is for someone to explain what Judaism is.There is a wonderful book that just came out and I strongly recommend it for anyone who wants to find out about this subject. I promise you wont be disappointed.It is a conversation between a Torah Scholar (Akiva Tatz) and a Buddhist Jew (David Gottlieb) called ""Letters to a Buddhist Jew.""Enjoy!"
5,Touching,This has to be one of Keanu Reeves's best movies since the matrix. this movie is a really good drama. this is a must see film.
4,A classic uplifting film for the human sprit,"I remeber Hardball coming out of the week as 9/11 back in 2001 and at the time it was released it was just the type of movie, the country needed. Hardball is a uplifting movie that makes one feel good inside. Keanu Reeves shows some of his best atcing since River's Edge. Diane Lane is very good in the female lead also. The kids on the team are all also veyr good actors , many of whom make a apperance for the first time on screen. The film will make you laugh and cry and I 'm proud to have it in my DVD collection. I give it *** out of ****."
1,pretentious tripe,I think what people find most appealing about this book is that it makes one feel as though poetry is easy to accomplish.
5,Jim Morrison is the best!,"I think that this book, is the best of the books of Jim Morrison, because it's made with so much feelings. It will open your eyes about the real life of Jim Morrison. ""Now is blessed the rest remembered"" -Jim morrison-"
3,Jim's poetry has always been hard to understand.,"This collection does contain some good poems such as ""power"" and ""Ode to LA while thinking of Brian Jones Deceased."""
3,a bit to heavy,"good if u out in cold weather for an hour,but to heavy to wear long time.also size runs small."
5,Excellent Course Text for HCI students,The breath and depth of this text truly embodies the necessary content for beginning HCI students in an undergraduate and graduate program. I've successfully used this text every semester with my students since its inception. The author's perspective of the discipline accurately reflects an increasing trend in HCI education that places less emphasis on computing and more on designing products to enhance human communication based on the social sciences. It is organized to provide an instructor a way to pick and choose selected chapters or proceed sequentially. Each chapter is multi-dimensional in its approach to provide an array of content that includes both theory and practice. I highly recommend it.
1,Too much padding,It would be user-friendly if the content was concise. The book simply violates the basic principle of design: make it simple!
4,Toxicology,"Not enough pictures, or diagrams and theres a bibliography practically between each section.. Overall a good textbook though. A good product that i recommend for a beginner in the field"
2,A man searching for his long lost sister:-(,"The story of an ex-slave searching for his sister and meeting the son of a couple that that had helped the ex-slave(Jake Penn) escape the south via the underground railroad many years before,the son(Jim McCutheon) has squandered his inheritance and for most of the story is a rather inept type person, the story takes place in Colorado but it isn't much of a traditional western."
2,Lots of writing,"The work itself is as I expected very intriguing, but this particular copy was full of weird drawings and all kinds of writing in it. I expected a little better condition"
1,bad hair dryer,I will not recommended this product to anyone.This product make my hair so dry and fuzzy.Since I start using this hairdryer my hair is falling.Iam really very disappointed.I hope I can returned this product and get my money back.
5,best one,"This is the best of Solano. My wife is been using this product for over 11 years. But the super is the one she really was looking for 1800 watts. It works great. Solano can also stand behind their items. I advise you getting one, it is worth it."
2,Did not work,"It came Broken in a box...it look like the motor was stock, and it was brand new.. I returned It and Got my money back."
3,It might have been good but...,I just repaired the battery with this kit and the included instructions. It didn't seem too challenging but I had trouble sliding out the motherboard from the casing and in the process broke the soldering on the headphone jack piece. Now the battery works great but I can't hear a thing. *Sigh* I am in the same place I started. An non working iPod with no way to purchase a new one. This is not a simple battery replacement.
4,great product,"This product is a great way to save money by replacing the ipod on your battery. The intructions are thorough and all the necessary tools are provided. The replacement process is very precise, so I don't recommend buying the product if you don't think you can handle the precise work."
2,Broke my Ipod,Not worth the trouble - I followed the directions perfectly and my ipod fried itself - If you have to replace the battery I suggest just buying a new Ipod and save the trouble or pay and have it replaced
4,A tightly woven adventure!,"""Lively Lady,"" delivers plenty of the sinewy narrative and strong character development that typify Kenneth Roberts' previous novels, ""Arundel"" and ""Rabble in Arms."" But it differs from its predecessors in its compactness. It is like a string quartet compared to those more orchestral works, producing a sound and feeling that is just as powerful if not as loud or lengthy.Set during the War of 1812, most of the action takes place aboard ship or inside the walls of the infamous Dartmoor Prison. In such close quarters, the narrator's psyche tends to loom large.The result is a compact novel that, despite its size, really packs a punch. I recommend it."
5,Great for Moms,"Great book for busy Moms trying to make healthy dinners for their family. It takes a little time to get the time right, but all the recipies I've tried have been good."
3,I don't get it!,"I was so excited to try this book. I'm a Weight Watchers member, and I often don't have a lot of time to cook, so this book seemed perfect. I even went out and bought a Dutch oven - the two quart, enamel version she recommends in the book - just to try it out. I've tried three of the recipes now, and I haven't enjoyed one of them. The Pasta Puttanesca was very salty (I added no salt), and while flavorful, all the vegetables were mushy. The Cioppino wasn't flavorful and all the vegetables were mushy. The Fish Chowder was the most successful recipe I tried. While also very salty (but this was the first recipe I tried, so I added the salt she calls for), but the tastiest of the bunch - I think because none of the vegetables had to be crisp. I've read all the enthusiastic reviews for this cookbook, and maybe I'm doing something wrong, but the mushy, salty results I'm getting aren't worth it."
3,Well..,"I ordered this a couple weeks before Christmas, and as of yet it is still in limbo waiting for the subscription to start."
4,Brinkmann has a great web page to order parts from,Just wanted to say that I have used Brinkmann products. There was a reviewer that had trouble finding a replacement element for his smoker. Brinkmann has a web page of a big line of products. Replacement parts are there. Go there:www.brinkmanncorp.com
3,Isaac Hayes--Can You Dig It?,"One CD contained several songs I was familiar with and the ones that had been popular during Isaac's tenure. CD 2 was less enjoyable. Over the many years and many hits, the double CD would have been more high quality if it contained actual greatest hits versus several unknown or unfamiliar songs. Overall, the sound quality was excellent and I enjoyed the DVD."
1,Illegal Promotional Copy,"What I received was an illegally sold promotional copy, with no ISBN number and marked as a promotional copy not for sale. I will be contacting the record label if my wife (for whom this was a present) has not already done so."
4,Combo treatment...... worked!,"We purchased a bank owned house that apparently had a flea infestation. We tried bombing, diatomaceous earth, frontline for pets, essential oils for pets and our toddlers, borax, capstar, and finally this product. Add to that daily vacuuming and flea combing pets. What a welcoming new home gift fleas are...... NOT! This product brought home the winning blow to the fleas. :) Four stars because I'm not sure how much credit goes to knockout alone, and because the smell was pretty strong."
5,Children with a gift,"The Von Trapp Children Vol I is a great listening experience. Every time I hear it, I am swept away to a world of beauty and innocence. It conjures memories from the past and dreams of the future. I highly recommend this to any listener!"
3,li-ion batteries,the batteries I received were 850mAh not the 1400mAh that I was expecting but are ok for the way I plan to use them
2,These are not Canon Batteries,"It is (NOT ANY)name?, these batteries seem to be working, they do not have a brand name on them. Seller is saying they are Canon batteries, they are not! On the back of the battery it say's: (for CN_NB_1L). Hay that is great, so good they don't want to put their name on it. Great advertising! This seller is not telling the truth. DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER!!"
4,A contemporary singer with a gift for old and new,"I had all but given up on country singers because there seemed to be an assembly line of people who sounded similar, singing nondescript music. Josh Turner has a wonderful voice with a lower register that resonates power enough to shake the roof and a wonderful mid register that is sweet yet manly. The songs on this CD range from up tempo country to romantic balads. He is accompanied by some of the best musicians in the business. He will be around for a long time and I look forward to an album where he sings some of the old standards."
3,Great Singing,"There's some great singing on this CD, but in the second half (when Josh's own songs enter the picture), the quality of the material takes a dramatic plunge. ""Me and God"" is the most god-awful thing I've heard in ages, despite the great Ralph Stanley. ""No Rush"" from the first , non-Josh-writtten half, is as near to perfect as current country music gets. A very mixed bag overall."
5,"Josh Turner, Your Man","My experence was perfect, My CD came in two days with standard shipping. I am very happy"
5,Your Man- Josh Turner,The best singer in country music today! Josh has another great album. I look forward to many more from this talented star.
5,Amazing!,"Josh Turner's new album is simply that. Your Man is a must have CD this year. Every song he sings on the album showcases his deep, rich voice that is like no other. My favorite song is the title track ""Your Man"". It's a great love song and he sings it so well. I definitely recommend this CD!"
5,CD,"Love it, big Josh Turner fan the quality of the sound makes you feel he is right in t he same room."
3,Great single...lackluster CD,Would You Go With Me .. best song hands down... the song is just great.. the rest of the CD.. not so great... I was highly unimpressed with this album as his hit single on the radio really drew me in to him. I dont know what else to say but just avoid the CD and buy the single. Lord Have Mercy on a Country Boy is the only other good song on this CD.
1,Stupid Marketing Scheme!,"Stupid marketing scheme. Star Trek tried this nonsense with 2 episode DVD's and now they wised up to put the entire season in one (1) package the way consumers ( that's right- US! ) want to obtain TV series ( i.e. Outer Limits, Twilight Zone, The Apprentice, etc. ). Pure greed..nothing else. To quote, ""the Donald""...You're Fired ! """
1,Why not 2 different sets?,"If it was so important to please WalMart, why not release it in the full season set and then offer the 2 1/2 season sets also? Avid video collectors are attracted to buying the whole season, I would think. I love the season 1 set, will purchase the season 2 (already pre-ordered the 1/2 season set) and look forward to the final season, which was my favorite."
3,"Two Parts, And Later Than Originally Advertised?","I'm looking forward to more LIS releases beyond the first season - especially since they will be in color. I'm a little ticked that the next release will now be late and in two parts, while the UK gets it both whole and NOW. With regards to the suggestion from an earlier reviewer to buy from amazon.uk, I would advise checking the regional formatting to ensure it will play on US equipment."
4,Made in the USA,"I must admit I will purchase LOS season 2 even though it is split into two volumes. However, I was disappointed to hear that the entire second season (one box set) was going to be sold in the UK starting July 6. This series was made in the USA yet the UK gets the better deal. I wonder how creative Fox will be in the USA for the release of season 3."
2,"Top notch acting, poor direction","The acting is stunning. Rush is almost as amazing playing Peter Sellars as he is playing the other actors. He plays the other actors in terribly conceived bits where he (Rush) takes on the roles of other characters as they step out of the story and comment on it. The film fails for a few reasons: the take on Sellars is relentlessly negative, so we never care about him; the music is ham-fisted, the script is laughable. But everyone shines, Emily Watson, Charlize Theron, Stanley Tucci, Miriam Margoyles, everyone is great. Too bad this doesn't make the movie watchable."
4,playstation controller,I like how it feels when you playing the only thing I do not understand its the bottoms for slow and turbo I havent figure it out yet. other than that its a good quality controller. I like it and my son likes it too.
1,did not work,"I used two o them, followed instructions and nothing happened. I remember using homemade ones when i was young and they worked wonders, so i figured these are ok too but i made a mistake. i guess paraffin does not work the same as white wax or whatever they use, i suggest trying something else."
3,Somewhat pleased,"I wasn't real thrilled with the product. It didn't work as advertised, such as removing wax. But it did release some pressure on the inner ear."
3,The Royal Diaries -Elizabeth I,"Princess Elizabeth is the daughter of a fallen queen, she is a forgotten princess. She lives a complicated life with her father, the king, hardly noticing her, and paying more attention to her sister, Mary, and brother Edward, the heir to the throne. The book describes Elizabeth's life, traveling through different palaces, archery contests, and learning(Latin and logic)"
4,an ok read,"This was a good book. It didn't blow me over but it was good enough. The thing that annoyed me about this book was that she complains that she is a ""forgotten princess"", or invisable, or none notices her! STOP COMPLAINING! it was ok but not my favorite."
5,A wonderful glimpse into the world of the Forgotten Princess,"I thouroghly enjoyed reading this book. Kathryn Lansky spins her words so well, and with such detail that you not only feel that you are reading the story but actually watching it, as a movie. I would recommend this book to anyone with an intrest in history and a desire to read a compelling book about a Princess that endured the hardships of her castle life as well as her family past to become one of the most reknowed queens in the history of the world."
3,"Elizabeth I: Red Rose of the House of Tudor, England, 1544 (","Nowhere in the description of this book was it mentioned, or implied, that this book was fiction. I felt duped when I discovered it was from the imagination of an author choosing to write for Elizabeth. From now on I guess I will have to read reviews and excerpts before ordering anything. This will make it much more tedious and time-consuming. How else to avoid a problem like this?The book reads wonderfully well - if you suppose that in actuality it is being written by Elizabeth. It's impossible, at this point, to offer a critique. I might have an entirely different opinion were I to know its true source."
2,a dissappointment,"Perhaps I was expecting too much but this rosy view of Elizabeth's childhood takes a bit too much poetic liscencing. Instead of giving the reader a young perpective on this remarkable woman this fiction is presented as a stylized ""biography"""
5,fabric of the Cosmos,"This is a fascinating presentation of the Cosmos. Brian Greene knows his stuff. If you're interested in how it all came to be, try it."
5,Great Information for All Ages,This was fabulous - interesting and well presentedYou can watch it over and over and pick up new stuff each timeHighly recommend it
3,painfully basic!,"If a highschool student needs some very basic research on the subject,this is the book.If you are going to include a chapter on stab and gunshot wounds,you should have more than 3 or 4 photos,(there is only one small stab wound photo).The section on decomposition has one drawing that is made up of a whole bunch of scattered little black dots that make it look like a bad copy machine reproduction that you can barely make out.It also insults any [person's] intelligence with phrases like,""Decomposed bodies look bad and often smell worse.""NO KIDDING!"""
5,Wrong Amazon entry,"Please correct your listing on this book. The author's name is Brad Randall, MD. You have entered it by his first name, not his last name. I know of this author and would like it corrected. Thank you."
1,Don't waste money,"At first I was hopeful, but very quickly not only was my dog barking I had this nice beep tone along with the barking that didn't phase him. It is now in the trash!"
1,collar is not effective,"This pet collar is very ineffective and cheaply made. It broke as I was trying to adjust volume. Unhappy with product, but was shipped quickly."
1,Do not buy this fan unless..,"Do not buy this fan unless you have some time to kill and a good set of tools, including a rubber mallet. I tried twice to get a fan not damaged in shipment. The shipping box is just too flimsy. After the second try I gave up, got out my tools, and spent about 30 minutes fixing all the damage. Once I got it to run without the fan blades hitting the fan guard or switch assembly I discovered the blade was way out of balance! This explains the noise and blade failures from the other reviews. I'll use it in the garage every once in a while when I work on the cars, but from now on I will read the reviews before I buy."
1,The shaft comes loose and the blades crack,"I should have read the reviews on this fan sooner. I have owned it for three years and thought it was a wonderful fan until the other day when I was standing over it and tipped the fan to face another way when the shaft let loose and sent out horrifying sounds. I ducked and quickly pulled the plug not knowing what had happened. When we opened up the fan to inspect the problem we also noticed that all three blades have cracks in them. I noticed one gentleman said he called the company. On my fan it has Patton Electric in New Haven, In....but I can't find a listing for this company anywhere. Shouldn't they be liable for replacement of this defective fan? If anyone has this companies phone number I would appreciate it if you would list it. Thank you......and please don't buy this fan for your own safety."
1,Doesn't work,"I bought 1 and it didn't work, so I bought another 1 at a different store and it didn't work either. Had the same problem with the Panic Mouse made by the same company."
3,My cat is not impressed,We were attempting to buy toys to entertain an 11 year old cat. I can't speak to the durability because he won't play with it. He looks at it and just walks away.
3,Doesn't measure up to expectations,"A less than auspicious start for what is an incredibly talented band of musicians. It seems Nashville stripped them of their Bluegrass aspirations, and made them play to a broad audience. When you read their personal biographies, included in the liner notes, these young Russian musicians point to Bela Fleck, Bob Dylan, and even Led Zeppelin as their inspiration, but you would be hard pressed to detect it in the music on this CD. Probably the most satisfying songs are ""Bearing Straight"" and ""Porushka-Paranya"" where there musicianship really shines. Seems like they would have been more at home in Austin than in Nashville."
5,"Excellent CD, impressive talent!","I saw these kids on 60 Minutes and had to have the CD. They are a very impressive group, natural talents! The CD is great music, the videos are great fun! I really hope they make a million bucks, and lots more music!"
5,At last...,"A CD that I can honestly say I enjoyed every track of. Haven't purchased a CD like that in years. As with the other reviewers..the instrumentals are GREAT and the vocals just beautiful. I would hate to see them pigeonholed exclusively into C&W as it would be a shame for people who normally discount country to miss out on this band. Great, great music!"
5,NEW SOUND FROM RUSSIA,"Both DVD and CD are a must! Just can't get enough of these fine kids. Other than the names are hard to pronounce the music is wonderful. Instrumentals and vocals are a new breath of fresh air in Country/Rock. Lets push this group if you see it the way I do.CJHereBrookfield, wisconsin 53045"
4,Fresh Bright Wonderful,"Yes! Bering Strait for the Top! Fresh and bright lyrics and wonderful instrumentals take you on a trip around the world! ""Bearing Straight"" and ""Porushka-Paranya"" are my favorites but the album really did Love me like a child."
1,"Not bluegrass at all, sounds like Wilson Phillips.","I am a fan of all sorts of bluegrass music -- newgrass, old time, gospel. This is NOT bluegrass. If you're expecting something a group of youngsters as talented as Nickel Creek, or as authentic as Del McCoury Band, you've definitely come to the wrong place.While this album maybe be an interesting example of cross cultural exchange, this album sounds more like Wilson Phillips of 80's fame, and less like bluegrass. There has certainly been a lot of hype around this album (NY Times article, 60 minutes piece) -- I wonder if the other reviews were written by similar hype-makers. I bought this because my interest was piqued by the NY Times article -- I'm always interested to expand my music collection.Sadly, my copy of ""Bering Strait"" is going up for sale."
2,not that good,"The mixes drone a bit more than they should -- if you are looking for something as good as any song on Dirty Vegas' last CD, you won't find even one song that good. Even the remixes of Dirty Vegas songs are uninspired. I'm not sure why other reviewers can give this 4 and 5 stars"
1,This novel is a crime,"Takes some cheek to write a novel around a protagonist who is naive to the point of stupidity, & surround him with unsympathetic characters (except for a kindly downscale law partner with both scruples & intelligence). Dan Galindo, Esq., formerly a U.S. prosecutor, is entirely unsuspicious of a creepy Ecuadorian immigrant living palatially off a mysterious import/export business, & is utterly unaware that the popular music industry is infested with dopers & bottom feeding scumbag managers & promoters. It might have worked had the author twisted this take on South Florida perversity for laughs, like Tim Dorsey. Instead, Parker plays it straight & creatively titles her book ""Criminal Justice."""
1,WHat HAppened?,"I remember the Chronic and Doggystyle when Daz was introduced to the world. He was tight, but what has happened to his flow? His flow is sloppy and slurred. I gave nim a chance because his first solo CD was good, but after listening to this, I won't give him another. The CD is so trite that you forget you're listening to it. I guess the fall of Deathrow had an affect on everyone except Dre. Dre that's because Dre laft when they were on top."
1,Cheeply made,I was disapointed in the quality of the product. The metal used to close and hold the mixer in place was light weight. The bail to carry the freezer was also of poor quality. I had a fiberglass one from about 30 years ago and the product was much better made.
4,Nostalgia is as good as it used to be!,"Bring back all the joys of a summer day on the farm with the White Mountain hand-cranked ice cream freezer. Who gets to crank? Who gets to sit on the old rug over the packed ice? And most important, who gets to lick the paddle? All these vital experiences come along with delicious home-made ice cream."
3,worked but quickly became worn,The cover came and was nice and light it fit nicely but after a couple of weeks the cover already shows chaffing from wind movement on the corners of the trailer.
5,A must read for educators and parents,"This book, as well as Temple Grandin's earlier books, provide an incredible wealth of information and insight. It should be required reading for all educators! Extraordinarily valuable."
5,Informative and intuitive,"I picked up this book for two reasons: I am a health care professional who deals extensively with children on the autistic spectrum, and at the same time a boggled owner of a very fearful pekingese mix whom I had adopted from a rescue shelter. Who would've known there was a great overlap in understanding both populations? This was a wonderful, enlightening book that I couldn't put down once I started reading. It was thoroughly engrossing, understanding animals and sensory-processing challenged children from the view who has intimate knowledge of their plight. This is an informative, intuitive book that analyzes behaviors in animals and people with autism, gives meaning to them, and makes them understandable to us.This is a great read for people who deal with persons with autism behaviors, for people who love animals, and for all who would like to delve deeper in to our human - and animal, and autistic-like - natures."
