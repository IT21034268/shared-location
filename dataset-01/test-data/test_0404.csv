2,Half a novel,"I've read about half this diatribe and given up on the inane propaganda and political pontificating. This is no a political thriller, it's a political rant, with a contrived story to provide Baldacci a vehicle. Skip it and save your hard earned money."
2,thriller by numbers,"This book has all the requisite thriller ingredients but the result somehow came across as a rote exercise, lacking in inspiration.The political viewpoints of the author came through too loadly and overwhelmed the plot, which had too many logical flaws to be very believable. The constant shifts between people and locations made it hard to relate to any of the thinly developed characters and bogged down the story instead of making it more suspenseful. Finally, the Camel Club itself turned out to be rather incidental to the resolution of the conflict, a let down from the huge buildup it received in early chapters.Baldacci is too talented of a storyteller to settle for such a mediocre product. I'd like to see him put more care into his future novels."
2,Choppy,This book was hard to follow initially. Picked up almost half way through and enjoyed the ending. Hope to read more.
3,Is anyone else having this problem?,"I have been trying to read the book on an Android Kindle app and it's giving me fits! When I touch the screen to go forward or back or to bring up the options it might do the expected, or it might just jump to the index! Then I have to figure out where I was and navigate back to that page and then wonder what will happen the next time I touch the screen!"
3,Slow Moving Propaganda,"David Baldacci books are an interesting thing: I either love them or I tolerate them. This book I tolerated. The novel centers around Alex Ford, a Secret Service Agent who joins forces with the Camel Club, a ragtag bunch who sole purpose is to detect conspiracies within the government. The club stumbles upon a murder that is connected to a plot that involves terrorists and brinks the war to the brink of Nuclear War. The book spews out some anti-American rhetoric that I have grown tired of hearing out of the media. If you are looking for a quick read, look elsewhere."
4,Waffen SS,"I have been interesed in WW2 and in particular the WAFFEN-SS for a long time now... I like to think I know alot about this period in history. I am trying to get a collection together of books on the SS as this is what interests me the most and I thought that this would be a great book to start with. Well I tell you that it is. Clearly written information combined with great photo's {some I had not seen before} makes for a great buy in my opinion, as well as being a reasonable price I would recommend this book to anyone interested in the Waffen-SS/Eastern Campaign. BUY IT!"
5,"Cute clock, great for Christmas Addicts!","I got this as a gift for my Uncle's 50th Birthday and he LOVED it. For years he has been looking for a clock that counts down ALL YEAR LONG! He is obsessed with Christmas and said that it was the ""best present ever."" If you are Christmas obsessed or know someone who is then this is the perfect item."
3,An exciting concept,"Although I enjoyed reading about this new technique and thought that the authors explained the scientific underpinnings extremely well, I was daunted by the 20 plus recipes for eliminating emotional problems. The points on the faces in the diagrams were so faint that I had trouble making them out. Yes, this technique DOES work, and it works very well. I wish the author's could have made it a bit more user friendly."
4,Don't Take it So Seriously,"To try and compare David Leitz with Burke or even Chandler would be a mistake. I think his writing is just plain fun. One of the joys of fly fishing is the atmosphere of mountain streams within walking distance of a cabin tucked into the forest waiting with a crackling fire and a dog curled up on a blanket. Then let's add a little thrill to the scene with an unsolved murder. If you read it for a quick, enjoyable thrill and to keep the fishing fires burning when you can't get to that cabin, then so be it. If you read it with the critical mind of an English professor, I'd say lighten up a bit. For the cost of a paperback, I think this is a very enjoyable read. Do yourself a favor and try it out."
5,The Killing Game,One of the best books I've read. Love it along with the other two in this series. Have recommended to many friends all have loved them. Couldn't wait to finish. Will reread many times.
4,First time Johansen reader,"The Killing Game is the first Johansen novel I have ever read. It was a little rough getting started and throughout the book I would get confused as to who was talking and have to reread some sections just to get it straight. Because of this, it took me a good while to get through this book. That being said, I really got into it and enjoyed the mystery and suspense. I almost didn't want to finish the book as I looked forward to reading a chapter or two on the stair stepper. I would recommend this book to readers who have the time for and who enjoy leisure reading."
3,The Serial Killer's Character is worth the read...,"I'm not much of a writer myself, so I'll be brief--In a nutshell, the serial killer's character was outstanding!Unfortunately the irritating part of the story was having to ""listen"" to the two men compete over poor, tortured, ""tough-as-nails"" Eve. I was so sick of their comments, and Eve's repeated defense of one to the other, that I ALMOST wanted to skip those paragraphs...the only reason I didn't is because I didn't want to miss even the smallest morsel of info regarding the killer!"
2,"Bad prose, good escapism","Johanson is, quite frankly, an incredibly bad writer. Her characters are more cardboard than Al Gore, and her dialogue includes such lines as ""go jump in a lake."" The Killing Game manages to combine everything that's bad about fiction. Nonetheless, the story is at least intriguing, and it's one of those books that makes a good read if you're having a tough time at work and just don't want to think for a week."
1,Disappointing Work,"I am a great fan of Iris Johansen and have read all her work, but frankly, her new book is a great disappointment to me. For the first time, I didn't finish her book and just skipped through it. I found this book very boring and the heroine's character and behavior are capricious, and is very mean and unfair to John Logan. As one reader said, I am glad that I haven't bought this book and just borrowed it from the library."
3,Thought I read it before,Does anyone know if this book The Killing game is a reprint? It seems i have read it before
2,Just average...,"The book kept me somewhat entertained through to the end, however I could care less about the attempt at a love story within between Eve and Joe. The who-dun-it ending was easy to figure out since they only introduced a handful of characters.Overall, I don't think I'd recommend this book."
4,A hauntingly beautiful tale of surival and discovery.,"Despite its naive eco-feminist overtones, Into the Forest is a surprisingly powerful novel. The writing is lyrical and the plot engrossing. Hegland's basic premises about pre-industrial society are, I think, romantic and mistaken, but her evocation of Nell and Eva's awakening to the natural world is so convincing and so lovely, it hardly matters. Like any myth, Hegland's vision of loss and redemption has a seed of truth to it. It legitimately asks and hints at what we've lost in our pursuit of a safe and convenient technological civilization. Beyond that, this is simply a gripping narrative of survival, akin to Elizabeth Marshall Thomas's Reindeer Moon and even Charles Frazier's Cold Mountain. I couldn't put it down."
4,Fascinating,"Evocative writing, very unusual story, fascinating. Not a book I would have chosen except for it being a book club choice; so glad I did."
3,Sacrificial Sisterhood,"Nell and Eva are easier to read about if you suspend reality. As previous reviewers have referenced any ""end of the world"" scenario is going to happen the way the author decides. What I found well done was the relationship between the sisters, the diarizing of one sister's experience--which, in effect, becomes the novel we read-- and their perspectives on what they have gone through. It is a worthwhile read, but remember--it's fiction."
3,Disappointing after a wonderful beginning,"The books starts off strong: interesting premise, good characters, well-written. Then, about halfway through, it gets weird and out of character and tedious. The end of the book made no sense at all; the final action is childish and immature, everything the girls proved they weren't as they survived. Maybe it was to show they are still children, despite everything that happened. There's also one ""scene"" between the girls that is disturbing and didn't really seem necessary, like it was written only for titillation. Anyway, it's a decent read, but not on par with Atwood."
1,"Lesbian incest as ritual suicide ... ""but well-crafted!""","The novel is finely crafted, slashingly lacerating, endlessly delusional, and compellingly suicidal. Once they overcome the unbelievably bad education they got from their parents, the girls quickly teach each other to fear all contact with other humanity. Through a rather complicated substitution of lesbian incest for rape, they create an aura of procreation and survival without having to actually survive. In the end, they pull their hole in upon themselves, mouthing reassuring ignorances about primativist survival, and crawl off to feed themselves to the boars, the bears, and the bananna slugs.Spectacular skills turned to dismal projects."
5,Oral History,"I have read all of Lee Smith's books and am pleased to say that she is one of the finest of the current novelists. She understands the language of Appalachia and is a story-telling genius. Oral History is not only captivating as a story, but will break your heart. What a great book!"
1,Oral History,What a bizaare story! The concept is wonderful with a student researching an unexplored family history of rural mountain folks. What is revealed probably would best be left untold. Lee Smith is a unique story teller and each book has some merit of historical significance. This book was very disappointing to me. The title is very promising but there's no redeeming quality in the plot and the characters are mostly unlikable. There are certainly better books than Oral History.
5,I tested prior to taking andro and after!!!!!,"The advice given is worth listening to. I did. I am 58 and tested prior to the use of Androstenedione and after, The results were great. I was at the lowest level of testosterone to start and after 6 months of 50mg of Ando per day, It was raised the middle level, Just where I wanted to be. L-Glutamine and Creatine are other supplements to be considered for older men, When used in correct doses and exercise bring good results. I have more studies on my website. Roger Mason, a Scientist has other good books on Amazon check them out."
4,"When it's loud I feel safer, too!","I'll be the first to admit that this CD is not as good as their DJ Kicks release or Big World, Small World, but who really cares? It's still a really good listen and gives you insight into how their sound has progressed. The only reason this album sounds a little tired and dated compared to their other ones is because this album really is from another era anyway, and it's not their fault we're only now getting to hear it. Love the My Bloody Valentine-esque backwards guitar loops on the opening track. The title track just plain kicks even if it does sound less than totally fresh at this point. Judge this album on its own merits without worrying too much about how it fits into the current musical landscape and you won't be disappointed."
5,the best in music,For nearly 7 years have I been an Peter Rauhofer fan. His mixes are almost always very good and hot to dance to. Not only that he is also one of the hottest DJs around after Junior Vasquez of course. This cd is superb and you should buy it if you like music or have seen or heard him before. So go and buy this wonderful album now. Peter is the man with a BIG M. Thank you for your time folks.
3,It was Good.,I found the version well acted but incredibly boring. It is a theatrical version not a movie version. There is a 2000 version that is much more entertaining.
1,I'd rate it a O star if you included it on your scale,"I can't believe these Reader Reviews rated this sappy-romance/bloody-war/pathetic-aging novel four and a half stars. I found it as ridiculous as ""Bridges of Madison County,"" though I have to admit it was better written. Why do men think a short little torrid sex and then mooning over one's ""lost love"" the rest of your life is TRUE LOVE? I wanted to say, ""C'mon, Patrick, get a life!"" And didn't anyone feel sorry for Patrick's wife during that Paris trip, her husband cheating on her with his dead best friend's widow, while she thought he was out grieving his lost buddies on battlefields and monuments? And while noble Julia wouldn't ""break up a marriage,"" she had no qualms about an affair with a married man with a two-year-old son. Of course she didn't know he was stupid enough to moon over his ""lost love"" the rest of his life. C'mon, Hull, with your obvious writing talent, you can surely do better than this!"
5,Touched on Many Levels,"As the daughter of a WW I veteran, who was in France in 1918; as the survivor of a lost passion, who remained unmarried for over 25 years; and as a just-turned-65-year-old who is contemplating her remaining years - this remarkable book gave me food for thought to last many months to come. Totally believable, it explained things I'd only imagined, painfully aroused long dormant emotions, and identified many of the fears one faces on the brink of ""old-age"". I don't know where Mr. Hull experienced so many of the horrors of both war and aging, but he shows us that with a lively spirit and a sense of humor, one can overcome even the unthinkable. A book I will read over and over and share with many others."
5,Poignant and Profound,"This is an amazing novel, an even more amazing first novel! The writer has captured the soul of a man reviewing and questioning the value of his life, with all its human aspects. Hopes, dreams, loves, loyalties, fears, weaknesses, regrets, questions and insights are all exposed, digested and ultimately accepted. If this isn't enough, the reader/listener is also given the most intimate and revealing of insights into the intricacies of emotion that war and its aftermath bears upon a soldier. This book belongs on everyone's must read list!"
4,Beautiful,Patrick Delaney is an unlikely hero. He finds himself at 81 contemplating his past and suffering the indignities of the present. WWI has become as fresh in his mind as if it happened yesterday. Patrick revisits his past; mourning his friend Daniel and his lost love Julia.Set in three time frames this book reaches the heart of what it is like to have loved and lost and to wonder about the might have been. You can't help but shed a tear for Patrick and Julia. Their chance meeting 10 years after the Great War ended altered the course of both their lives leaving Patrick to regret the choices he made 60 years later.This is also a story of triumph. Triumph of spirit and the will to chose despite impending death.I can't help but feel anyone reading this book will be touched by the beautiful story of Patrick and Julia. I look forward to reading more by Jonathan Hull.
2,Disappointed,"I guess you either loved it or hated it. I was sorry I invested by money in this tape. The story consisted of 75% graphic description of World War I. I expected more romance, and less blood and guts! I also did not particularly enjoy the narrators voice, which was dull and lifeless. Also on the tapes, Julia and Daniel never married! He wrote pages of his proposal, but died before he sent them off to her. Like I said, I was disappointed."
5,A Memorable Odyssey,"I finished reading Hull's inspirational novel months ago and, still, I cannot get it out of my mind. Hull's ability to draw you into the minds of his characters and engage you in their thoughts is extraordinary! Read it!!"
1,Labels Don't Fit,"If you have ever used the ""Easy Apply"" labels in the past, you'll be surprised to learn that Avery redesigned the ""Easy Apply"" label strips. I'm not sure why they did this, but the new format doesn't fit the actual tabs on the dividers, so you're left with approximately 2 millimeters of excess clear label hanging off the end of the divider. Okay, so you figure you can just stick them on manually, right? Well, that is much more difficult than the old format where you applied each label individually because of the ""Easy Strip,"" which is designed to stick to the ""Easy Apply"" strip. Overall, I would STRONGLY advise any consumer AGAINST purchasing this product until Avery's product development team redesigns the ""Easy Apply"" format, and who knows when that will be?"
2,Save your $17.99!,"Bill Hick's talent as comic is not in question. I find his material very funny as well as insightful. My problem is with the producers of this DVD. It contains material from three of his performances (Chicago, Montreal, London) -- unfortunately he delivers much of the same material at each venue. Instead of a 3.5 hour DVD this easily could have been kept to 90 minutes with just a bit of creative editing -- perhaps they should have interspersed scenes from the included documentary in between his live performance pieces to eliminate the redundancy? As it stands it's as if he did three shows in your town on consecutive nights and you went to see all three of them -- you would catch a new joke or two at each show but you'd also end up hearing the same ones three times!"
2,Ditto: Repetitive,"1. Watered down Sane Man 2. Shorter, alternate take on #1 in Chicago. 3. Relentless: New Material in England; all you'll be buying the dvd for.If you want Bill, get Sane man, especially if this is your first Bill experience."
4,TRUE ROOTS MUSIC!,"I got this album from my dad and it is truly the roots for Samoans in the world today. I live in Salt Lake City, and it's a pretty churchy town as the world knows and with the translations from my dad and mother I've ""Come closer to God"" through most of the songs on this album. I know that the album is a bit scratchy and hard to understand, but that is probably the best part of the cd...AUTHENTICITY, and the chants and harmonies of the voices of SAMOA are still heard crystal clear to the open ear."
3,"Powerful, abrupt, violent","Flannery O'Connor, Russell Banks and Jersey Kozinzky meet for coffee , hash browns and small talk about psychic exile and the best sort of knife edge to hack through a bothersome bit of bone.Odd, disturbing, violent material here--violence either explicit or always at the edge of the crystallized situations here--all of which are made more jarring with Alexandra Leggat's taste for terse sentences and abrupt endings.It works, for the most part,and the arc through the stories, life inside cars, on dark streets, side roads, parking lots behind anonymous bars, presents us with any number of dazed, abused and high strung women and rattled, crazed, raging men enacting any number of strange movements and quirks.At best, these stories are an adrenaline jolt, speaking truly to the sort of flash that gives one the urge to leap in front of traffic, to challenge immensity of grave and incalculable danger. Fans of Joyce Carole Oates take note."
1,Rich B from who cares????,I am having surgery in less than a week so I was reading all the books I could find on the subject. When I read this one I was just screaming WHO CARES? The whole book is about this Rich chick from Florida who's husband sells million dollar mansions. She goes threw her experience of weight loss surgery but the whole time she just talks about how she went to this resturarnt or that one. She went to the spa bla bla bla... After she loses her weight (her motto is somthing about food not being better than thin feels?) she decides she wants to have plastic surgery. Not because her pouch is incumberson to her but b/c she wants a total body lift and to spend her rich husbands money. I mean PLU-EEZE who really lives that that?
1,There are more helpful books for pre-ops.,I'm 5 months out of WLS and I find this book horrible. I'm glad I did not read this before surgery because I would think that life after surgery was perfect. She quickly skims over her bad episodes while going on ad nauseum about her triumphs. We all go through good and bad and it need to have equal weight. Any body who has had surgery will tell you to follow your surgeon's dieticians advice. She offers advice on eating that is not the norm followed by most surgeons. The one point she did not bring home is that everyone is different.
1,Very thin... on useful information,"This was an awful waste of money. Little more here than... ""aren't I amazing, and having a good time now?"" I have found some of her advice to be contrary to current medical thinking and I have found some of the products she sells - not to be in the best interest of post-op patients."
4,Great WLS Book,"This book is mainly written for those who had the RNY surgery. But her Susan's insight on what to order, when eating out our invaluable. The recipes are fantastic.So this is a good book for RNY, and Bandsters alike."
3,Harris should be ashamed.,"I had read Red Dragon and Silence of the Lambs, so obviously, I wanted to read the third book in the Lecter series. The book was thrilling and gross, and the characters were awesomely bad. Then something happened: I read the ending.I have never been so offended by anything before in literature in my life. Never has an author been so untrue and disloyal to his characters the way Harris was to ""Clarice.""He owes his readers an apology.The book was thrilling and entertaining but the ending negates too much written before it. The ending wins this book only 3 out of 5 stars."
3,Unfinished!,"Spenser fans will be partially pleased and partially frustrated by this almost-done book. There's lots of good Spenser wisecracking, and more solidifying of his moral integrity and his relationship with Susan. But please, Mr. Parker! We readers need closure! Just nailing a bad guy and ending the book isn't enough. What happened with all the supporting characters? This book leaves us hanging. Good Spenser, Mr. Parker, but you've done better."
2,Time and Again,"Another Robert B. Parker novel. Gee, what could it be about?How 'bout this?:Spenser (time-tested & true, sensitive, but macho hero) + Susan (randy talk & sound advice) + dysfunctional family (garden variety) + manly sidekick (oh heavens, a gay guy, this time!) + ""snappy"" dialogue (eat your hearts out, Nora & Nick) + less-than-obscure mastermind criminal (another woman!) + a dash of shotgun justice (always cathartic) = by gosh, another Spenser novel.Missing in action: Hawk (out to lunch in Europe, or someplace, with a presumably sexy Harvard professor. Yeah, right!). Less than usual: cooking (that's a relief) & dog antics (that's also a relief).Sum total: same-old same-old. ""Old"" being the key word."
3,"Enjoyable Spenser novel, but Nothing Special","I read a lot of Robert Parker, and I thought HUGGER MUGGER was just okay. This novel has a relatively weak plot, and there is very little mystery about who committed the crime. Horseracing is part of the storyline, but it plays a relatively small role. Those expecting a Dick Francis experience will probably be disappointed.There is no Hawk in this novel, but quite a bit of dialogue with Susan Silverman. There is also a rather silly subplot involving a nanny that has absolutely nothing to do with the main story -- Parker just seemed to throw it in for kicks.Still, I found HUGGER MUGGER more enjoyable than 90 percent of the crime fiction I read these days, simply because I really enjoy Parker's incredibly good writing and dialogue. This is a fast, funny, enteraining read. This is pretty typical of Parker's later Spenser books -- fun, but not particularly original or memorable."
3,Is Parker in the stretch?,"It seems to take longer to pick up a Parker novel than it used to. No one has a leaner writing style. Parker can say more with less words than anyone, he is a master. But often I wonder if good guys might be more verbose. The good guys always talk like Spenser. This chapter has less inventiveness than one would like and ends with a scene not unlike the old movies drawing-room conclusions. Just once,maybe more would be better."
3,Where is the last chapter?,"A good, not great Parker/Spencer novel. Moves along fast and for the most part, fun reading. Major disappointment, it seemed like he forgot to include the last chapter. There were several important issues not resolved which took a lot away from the whole effort. It left a rather empty feeling."
3,Overrated,"I dont get the hype about this game. Every time I play i go around like Rambo and im fine I just pick up some body armor and im fine.I'll admit the multiplayer is sweet but why cant you ever pick your 1st weapon , all you get is a little pistol and pick up guns along the way. And the Bond has too much health(he must be on something) and the enemies are'nt that good. An example is in the facility I shoot someone with the KF7(Ak-74) they run up the stairs instead of looking up and firing from the 1st floor."
3,Problems with 007,"This game is very fun,except I have two problems.Number 1 is that on multiplayer,two people can't be on a team,which really stinks. Number 2 is thatit doesn't have good graphics that other games do."
1,James Bond.........................................NO!,How dull can you get. These games are supposed to be good for crying outloud
4,Pretty Nice Game!,"This shoot-em-up game is only for ages 10 and up. Heavy on violence and fun. The only problem is if you are standing in a doorway, and there is a guy facing you, he won't see you. ... Anyway, it's pretty good."
3,007 Fun,I am a seven years old boy.If you have a rumble pack it will feel like a gun!It is fun to play for more then one players.
5,The Best Game Yet! (with a guide),"When I first bought this game, I got stuck at the 4th level. i put it away for a while, thinkig it was impossible to beat. My friends told me what to do, but they also suggested that I buy the player's guide so I cold read and play right through the game. I would suggest anyone who buys this game to get the guide, or it will take you a long time to win. Most enjoyable is the multiplayer level, because you and your pals can spend hours just shooting at each other (keep in mind- IT'S JUST A GAME). I think it is far superior to ""Tomorrow Never Dies"", because that game has no multiplayer mode. Once you beat the game, that's it!"
5,EXCELLENT Game,"This is an excellent game! Once you start playing you cannot stop until you actually beat it! This has averythingn a GOOD game should have: Excellent graphics, excellent gameplay, good2-player mode, and good sound. The only flaw in this game is... well... their are no flaws, this game gets a SOLID 5. Thanks for reading my review. Happy Gaming. P.S. Don't buy Pokemon Snap... Thanks!"
3,okee- dookee!,"Sorry Mario, your game was great.... until I beat it 3 hours later! Frankly I was a bit disapointed in you Nintendo. The graphics were great, but the music was poor. The levels were cute, so I nearly gave it to a little girl I was babysitting. All in all I think it was o.k. Buy it, beat it, and put it up in aution! Better luck next time Nintendo."
4,Mario Kart is Fun!,"When I had this game, I did not stop playing until I got to winning the game. It's fun for awhile to throw objects at people that are racing against you. It has a four player mode, which is not bad, but sometimes gets a little confusing when you're watching other people racing. The split screen should never be included. Although, that it is which is easy to get distracted. But Mario Kart is fun and it should be in one of the hand-held games, too. I wouldn't mind playing this. Oh, I have the one on Gameboy Advance, which is cool but not like the one from Nintendo 64. Now, that confused me."
4,Classic,"Mario Kart 64 is pretty fun. 8 characters and 16 tracks. In 1996, that was a lot.I still think that you should download it on the Wii Virtual Console for $10.63. Four hundred dollars is a lot of money. Yoshi's Story is six hundred. Both of these games I downloaded on the VC."
5,just sweeeeeeeeeeeeeeeet.,This game is another awesome game to every ones collection. So much to do and very challenging. I recomend this to anyone anywhere anytime.
2,Gave up,"No matter what the book jacket said or some glowing reviews on Goodreads, I won't be finishing this book. At first there was great promise, but it descended into something I didn't have patience to follow. I've been reading everything I could find on Burma (Myanmar) in preparation for a month there soon. There are soooo many excellent books. This one didn't fit my criteria right now. Maybe another time. There were some enticing reviews by other readers."
4,long awaited compilation has arrived,"Chris Goss finally apeases the old fans of the first two albums by releasing the compilation of MoR and solo material. A few of the highlighted songs are recorded with old compadre Ginger Baker, as well as the studio version of JJ with Scott Weiland, and the full version of JODY. This one is almost like a ""Physical Graffiti""--a CD of really great outtakes recorded over the past 15 or so years, and it kinda begs the question, ""Why are we hearing these fantastic songs now?"" Wonderful guitar work, mostly acoustic, and melodic vocals set a pretty mellow tone throughout, so don't expect any distortion pedal laced rock songs on this one. If you like Chris Goss' s mellow stuff, get this right away."
4,Finally!,"For those of us who have been stuck on the Suffer Bus all these years, this CD is manna from heaven! Why Chris Goss and company haven't been in the studio has to be the mystery of the stone age. Goss' vocals on this CD soar (a chorus consisting of Goss, Gerry Rafferty and Jack Bruce would be something to hear) and his guitar work -- both acoustic and bluesy electric -- are vintage MoR. These recordings have been around the dust bin for far too long. Fans want MoR!"
5,Everyone should read,"There are a lot of people who would rather put their head in the sand about where their ""stuff"" comes from as they would rather not think about it and try to live the ""American Dream"" they think is accomplished by buying more stuff. This book is well written as it gives you a good ""trail"" to follow if you wish to investigate further, but keeps the information brief enough so you can follow the ""story"" and get the underlying message. It does not take long before you are stunned about how many miles the products travel before they reach you and how much impact they have on the planet. This should be a must read for all high school kids. Although at times I felt myself drifting as the authors detail the complex trail of materials, the overall effect and understanding is there and the pace allows you to keep reading in semi-horror. This and Annie Leonard's work are the perfect Earth Day cirriculum."
3,Should we believe?,"Should we believe the statements in this book when Mr. Ryan tells us streets are paved with a twelve-inch layer of asphalt?It's probably just an innocent mistake, but obvious factual errors make me wonder about the veracity of the rest of the book."
4,Book and HTML versions are very different,"I bought the ""HTML edition"" thinking that I'd save a tree and burn pixels instead. But the HTML is not the book; it is a very short essay. If you're expecting the same content as what's on paper, be warned."
4,Oooohhh...there's nothing like a good battle sequence!,"I love this game. I have absolutely no idea why i'm so enthralled with it, maybe it's the incredible graphics, maybe it's the story, maybe it's just the great fun of it...i don't know. If you really enjoy the fantasy/adventure aspect of gaming you'll love this. I'd recommend it to anyone...it's just so much fun!"
2,Best Ever? Not even Close.,"The game is extremely linear and quickly became boring. It is very easy. I mean there are no puzzles or challenges whatsoever. I don't think I lost a single battle in the entire game. Don't be fooled by all the great reviews. They must have beeen written by pre-teens or very new RPG players. This game is not suiable for adults. It is very good for a console style RPG with many interesting places and effects. However, there are no intellectual challenges and the story is extremely childish."
4,Square produces yet another masterpiece!,"For almost a decade Square has delighted us with the mind-blowing series known as Final Fantasy. Final Fantasy 7 is no exception, it has phenomenal music scores composed by ""The Great"" Nobuo Uematsu, stunning graphics, character development, at least 40 hours of game play,and an intense, emotional story line. Although certain areas of the series have changed due to advancements in technology, this game still retains the characteristics that made the Final Fantasy series loved by millions."
4,Simply the greatest rpg ever if not the greatest game ever.,"In playing Final Fantasy VII, you are taken into a world where anything is possible and nothing is impossible. From the moment you meet the beginning characters until it is time to face Sephiroth, the game is absolutley brethtaking, it is a masterpiece that should be played by each and every gamer who calls himself a serious gamer. The graphics are phenominal and they cooncide with one of the greatest storylines I've ever seen in a movie or a video game. All in all, Final Fantasy VII is simply a must play game for any real gamers out there, capturing the minds and fascinating even those who are not big rpg fans. This is for certain, the best rpg I've played in a long time, and definitely the best graphics. If u have not played it, pick it up and give it a try. You may not eat, sleep, or go to the bathroom once engulfed into the world of Final Fantasy VII."
2,Definitely lacking atmosphere,"Do you remember how DOOM had you sitting up all night just to see what was round the next corner ?? Also, that ghostly soundtrack and the eerie lighting ? Then we had Quake, with it's dirty brown palette and Nine inch nails soundtrack. Nearly lost my job over that one - EXCELLENT !!Then we all ran out and bought Unreal ?? Hmmmm, I found myself <ESC>aping out of this one after 20 minutes...... Just didn't have that addictiveness to it. From a gameplay standpoint though, the AI in the monsters is top notch (Try the Difficult setting). On a VOODOO board the graphics are just excellent. But, it just doesn't have atmosphere.......It's a nice try at a very ""hit or miss"" market but, this one missed more than it hit for me."
2,Beautiful but Boring,"Yes, the graphics and sounds to this game are unreal, however the gameplay is nowhere near. The puzzles, storyline, and overall gameplay is totally lacking from the ""incredible new experience that would redefine the generation."" With the four years spent in creating this game, you would think more time would have been spent in gameplay rather than just the grapics engine. Look elsewhere for ""unreal"" experiences."
3,Ok for the $$,"I needed a simple mounting bracket for a 19"" LED TV to mount in front of my treadmill. That is exactly what I got. It works perfectly, but when I started assembling it (easy to assemble), I noticed all of the parts weren't there. It was only missing a couple of washers so I went to the garage and got a couple washers to finish assembly. Not that big of deal to me, but what about people who don't have a few extra washers handy? When you buy something new, you expect all of the parts to be there no matter what you paid for it. I would recommend this to a friend and then give him a few washers so he don't have to make a run to the store:)"
1,A cliche' comes South,"No other author in the universe could have gotten this trite piece of fluff published. I guess if I'd given Wolfe millions for his next novel, I'd feel obligated to print anything he squirted out in the meantime, too. This is tired, trite, silly, and WE'VE BEEN THERE BEFORE, TOM."
3,Airborne jump without a parachute,Stereotyped Forrest Gump outguns unarmed Barbara Walters in a battle of wits. Insecure television producer only now realizes life is unfair
1,You Have Got To Kidding,"You guys have got to be kidding! Tom Wolfe is a genius, but this tape (CD) is the worst sort of trash imaginable. I have no idea what Mr. Wolfe had in mind when he produced this seedy little tidbit, but he must be as astounded as I to read comparisons to Dickens.Did anyone besides me actually listen to this junk?"
3,good,i have it on regular DVD also and is not really great difrence coparing with the DVD i have it's ok
4,almost complete documentary on roots and origins of Ganges,"Well done documentary on history, origins or Ganges. The river has been a witness to thousand years of flourising civilization on its banks."
1,Not another Motley Crue Fiasco,"If you remember Motley Crue releasing their concert DVD without Tommy Lee, then you'll be right at home with a Poison concert without C.C DeVille. What are these bands thinking about? Don't even ask me about the lip-synced KISS live in Las Vegas ... . Bottom line........buy at your own risk. P.S. I did think Journey 2001 live kicked ... with new drummer and front man. That dude looked and sounded (exactly) like Steven Perry, maybe even better. Oh, did I mention the latest Judas Priest Live DVD without Rob Halford?....uh, well, nevermind...you get my drift."
5,very cute,I love the fact it has a built in diaper. Its very cute and easy to put on. I had so many people stop me at the pool and ask where I got it. My daughter has already out grown it. But this is a great buy still. Her next suit will be one like this.
4,che bella! the italian radiohead?,"i was living in Rome last year when this album came out... actually, it was during my first week there. i was walking around the cobbled streets in the Brooklyn-equivelent of Trastevere, and approached one of the many vendors of bootleg CDs. I gazed across the dozens of albums carefully aligned atop the spread bedsheet, and one caught my eye. it was called ""Il Suicido Dei Samurai""... the title made the album seem worth the five euro investment on a band i had never heard of. how pleased i was to find out that the album lived up to all of my hopes. Imagine a Bends-era Radiohead sung in the most euphonious language on the planet, and you get this album. if you want to buy something on the fringe... a rare and relatively unknown offering... a glimpse of another country's underground music scene... get this album! it won't disappoint."
4,A geat piece of work!,"I thought the character development, detail work, and research were all very well done. The setting was well chosen and interesting. The place was the initial draw for me."
2,Pass this one up,I just couldn't get into the story. It was confusing. Not as well written as his other books. I was disappointed.
4,North Sea Atmosphere,"You can feel, see, hear, and smell the setting of the story of Andre Szara, a spymaster in Paris. The setting is vivid and alive for the reader. You can feel that you are there from the beat of the North Sea rain to the smell of coal fumes to the sound of the ship's bell. It's especially nostalgic to me to read about the tramp freighter Nicaea's adventures. I sailed the North Sea for the first time last summer and I remember it well."
2,"A heavy, ponderous work","This story was ponderous and tedious. A complicated story line, which caused difficulty in understanding what was going on. If you don't already have a strong historical knowledge for this time period and place, you may have difficulty understanding the names, events, places, etc. I gave up on it after only going about 1/3 through it. Just not worth the effort."
3,Incomplete,This is probably the third book I have read by Alan Furst. This one was particularly hard to follow . His main character always seems to have a life changing love interest but this time there is more than one and they seem to change for no apparent reason.It was entertaining but after the third novel it's clear that he follows the same formula every time and he is becoming predictable
5,A great game that is eazy to pick up.,"A great game for all racing fans. You have to earn the cars by winning races. And to win the races you need to get a license, and that is very chalanging. But the arcade mode is a great way to practice for the races. Has great Replay value."
1,The pits!,I bought this game for my new PS3 and it sucks. Don't bother! Mickey mouse graphics and sounds.
5,Gran Turismo is unmatched!,"I'm not kidding when I say that I've tried all the racing games on the market, and Gran Turismo is unmatched in it's realism, competitive characteristics, and sheer ""fun"" value. There is absolutely nothing on the market which can compare, and I'll be the first in line when Gran Turismo 2 comes out."
5,The finest driving simulator ever created,"This amazing racing game, with 160 cars and multiple tracks, is as much fun as I have ever had with a racing simulator."
1,Please do not waste your money,"This book and cd will not do a thing for you. spend your money on Nova's gmat prep, princeton, and kaplan books and of course the official guide. Agreed that these are not perfect books but they complement each other and you are able to learn something from each of them. The peterson book will only aggravate you since the author doesn't seem to know much about gmat. The cd rom only takes you to their web site and you cannot work offline. Not that you would want to since the problems are nothing like the ones on the real gmat tests."
5,A tour de force--Excellent gift book,"This is an beautiful book. It fulfills the promise of documentary photography by bringing us into intimate contact with people whose lives seem far removed from ours. As we look at these pictures, and read the text, we see how their history has been a central but forgotten part of ours. Remarkably, it accomplishes this without demeaning either its subjects through sentimentalizing them, or us, the readers through patronizing or ideologizing. These photographs, themselves richly interpretive, still invite the reader into interpretation."
2,Totally different from other dream books,I have had this book a long time. It was ok until I got a copy of the Dreamers Dictionary by Barbara Condron. The interpretation of symbols from one book to another is totally different! I started to write my dreams down and the Condron book seemed to make more sense. I ended up throwing my copy of this book away. It was of no use to me.
5,Best dream book ever!,Love this book. I have a few dream books from other authors but this one is usually dead on. It's kinda creepy how accurate it is.
2,horoscopes,"If you are into horoscopes, then this book is for you. If you think dreams are more about psychological issues that manifest themselves in dreams and you would like to discover the underlying phenomena of these dreams, then you will find the book inadequate from this perspective."
4,Enjoying the book!,"It has already predicted some events in my life...AMAZING! The book is very informative, and teaches you how to analyze your dreams (dreams that you have don't mean anything if you have overeaten, or are emotionaly distraught, for example)I am enjoying this book, and I reccomend it to anyone that wants to learn more about theur dreams. DO NOT TAKE THEM LITERALLY! They all mean something! ALMOST anything you could dream about is included in the book."
3,Dreams and Teens,I was a bit disappointed at the quality of paper used in this small paperback. It was a requested present from a teen who already had access to extensive ( and too scholarly rumminations by among others C.Jung ). The size and depth however was about right for the reciever /but there were no exclamations of excitement. I might have returned it and searched other venues had time permitted.From: An Old Bibliophile with high expectations
4,Ending left me unfulfilled...really 3 1/2 stars.,"This books was definitely better than most ""legal thrillers."" I can't believe anyone figured this out by the middle of the book, because the ""surprise"" ending had absolutely nothing to do with the entire story; it really did not fit unlike Turow's Presumed Innocent which did. I agree with the reader that was mildly disappointed at the ending. I was shocked at the ending, but it left me a little empty."
2,Almost a contender,"This book started well and had a good sense of place (San Francisco).The plot had some interesting twists. However many of the book's events seemed contrived just to further the plot and didn't seem like normal occurrences within the book's fictional world.It's another one of those mysteries where the case is eventually resolved in spite of the lawyer/detective rather than because of him.The reader did a creditable job, though his voicings for some of the Latino and Asian characters were highly stereotyped.In short the book had some merits but by the end it made for frustrating listening."
2,Well researched but not well argued or accurately presented.,"Seyyed Vali Reza Nasr makes an effort to present the life and idealogy of Sayyid Mawdudi but dissapoints by presenting a very unbalanced and bias views on him. He has misinterpreted and misrepresented a number of arguments on Sayyid Mawdudi. He has failed to acknowledge Sayyid Mawdudi's recognition, admiration and acceptance that he had received from the Muslim countries and communities at the time. A simple example would be that the awards, invitations and visits that Mawdudi received and made are not mentioned at all in this book. The book presents a some-what distorted and confused image of Sayyid Mawdudi, which any common reader will fail to rationalize,. Sayyid Mawdudi's contributions and effect in the muslim world are actually absent from the book."
4,"Overall, lived up to expectations.","I used the teleconverter extensively during a recent photography seminar at Wolf Park in Indiana. I was pleased with the quality of the resulting pictures, most of which were far better than I'd have been able to achieve without the converter. The converter is not effective over the entire 0-4x optical zoom range of my Powershot A520 because the small-diameter opening on the camera end of the converter is smaller than the lens. You should only expect it to extend the upper end of the zoom, not magnify the entire range. The converter is not threaded to accept filters, which was something of a disappointment. All in all, the device met my expectations and helped me to make the most of the seminar I attended. I haven't used one of the (much) less expensive aftermarket products and so can't tell if a third of the purchase price would have given as good a result."
2,Boring,"I thought this game would be great; I'm a big X-Files fan. But it was really boring. It was just a matter of finding the right place to be at the right time; no puzzles, no actions that would affect the flow of the game. You just wander from one place to the other. It was cool to be able to interact with Mulder and Scully, but other than that, this game was a waste of time."
5,Wierd Al's Best Yet.,"Wierd Al Yankovic's CD ""Running With Scissors"" has not only parodies but also songs he wrote himself. This is my first Wierd Al CD and I really like it. I've heard many of his songs but I'm really impressed by this CD. Another thing I'm impressed by is his voice. He actully sounds the the varied artists he mocks."
3,good but it could have been better,"As a fan of Weird Al's for many years, I admire his musicianship and his song parody talents. Just like his releases in the past, there are moments of greatness smacked right up against pure junk. The song, The Saga Begins was brilliant yet, Albuquerque was tuneful but a complete waste of time. What was he trying to say? Pretty Fly For A Rabbi to me came off as lukewarm. Whenever you see Al live in concert, he performs some really great parodies that never seem to get released on his albums. What's up with that? When is that stuff ever going to see the light of day? Has he ever considered releasing a cd with just his own songs on it? I think it would sell. Running With Scissors will be loved by the fans but just doesn't have the mass appeal as say, Weird Al in 3-D did. After waiting for this latest release, I was expecting better. Maybe Al should give up his t.v. show and go back to making better records."
5,Wierd Al is a genius.,"Yeah, he's wierd, but he's incredibly clever! You won't find anyone better at parodies than Al Yankovic. I use them all the time in my high school English class as examples for my young artists. But Yankovic also writes great original songs like ""Your Horoscope for Today"" and ""Truck Drivin' Song"" that'll have you in stitches. In addition, this is toe-tapping music in its own right. So when's he coming out with the next CD?"
3,O.K. for a CD,I'm 11 .It was a good Cd.5/6 songs I like 1/6 I didn't like.Some of the songs were inerpropret for my sis (7) who I didn't let her hear.Some even I would'nt listen to myself.But some are funny and memerable (memorible meaning getting stuck in your head).I would recomend it for the older kid audiunce (10+).
5,THE FUNNIEST ALBUM I'VE EVER HEARD!,"This cd is an amazingly funny group of parodies from the late 90's. I first heard about weird al on vh1 when I saw one of his songs performed. After that I went to one of his concerts and bought two of his cds. This album is the funniest! Even if you've never even heard of him buy his cds NOW! I promise you'll be happy. If you haven't been keeping up with the latest music then buy one of older albums. no matter who you are, buy this album and I promise you will love it!"
5,"""Running With Scissors"" by ""Weird Al"" Yankovic","My family and I can't get the songs out of our heads! But we've got huge smiles on our faces while singing the tunes... ""Weird Al"" is a genius, and this album, by far, is his best: Contemporary and, yet, thanks to his flying accordian and Spike Jones takeoffs, very much ""Classic Al"" music. Definitely a must have for any ""old school"" groupie or new addition to his fan club."
2,ok at best,Some of the confessions are good but 90% of them are boring crap tha you hear everyday. Buy it if it's dirt cheap.
2,What?,I expected something simalar to GTA III. I was wrong! I didn't like this game. The graphics and the controls stink. So does the view! I suggest that you get Vice city and GTA III before you get this!
3,"Old, but cool","GTA 1 is a very old game, so anyone should expect realistic grafics nor long and complicated missions, as in the last three GTAs, but it's a game in the same style of the newer GTAs, and fun as well. I indicate the game for anyone for anyone who thinks that a good game is a good game, no matter how old it is."
4,A great choice,I got this toy box about a month ago for our 17 month old twins. It holds tons of toys and I believe it will hold up very well over the years. The canvas is thick and the toy box is very sturdy. My only complaint is that the lid does not attach and comes loose easily. The lid is pretty heavy and has created some panic situations by my kids. I have removed the lid for now and will probably put it back on when they are a little older. The price is very reasonable too. An all-around great choice.
2,Great story told terribly,"At this point it's almost sacrilegious and anti-patriotic to say anything bad about this book, but I must. The bravery of the men who fought on Iwo Jima and the subsequent story of the men who raised the flag is one that must be told--unfortunately James Bradley is not the man to tell it. His writing detracts from the the tale and is so bad and so hackneyed that it is almost an insult to the men about whom he's writing. Bradley's choppy sentences are the stuff of teenagers or college freshmen, and I'm not surprised that this book was rejected by several publishers. Someone should have purchased the idea from Bradley and then hired a much, much better author to flesh it out. If there is a cliche that Bradley doesn't use in Flags of Our Fathers, it's merely because he hadn't heard it yet. I could not help but think, as I was reading it, that the author had movies in mind, not just movies he'd seen but a movie that might be made of the book he was writing."
2,"The story of a flag raising, an homage to Mr. Bradley's father. Watch the documentary for the real Iwo story.","Why does everything about Iwo have to be about that flag and the six men who hid in a hill while 10's of thousands of Marines fought and died to take a strategic stand that would bring about the end of the Pacific war? My father was one of those Marines who was in the second wave--the most lelhal one--onto the beaches, or as the men called it ""Black Hell"". He's been dead for decades, but I still read the letters he managed to get home to my mother and I still cry every time. Why did Spielburg choose this book on which to base a movie? It has nothing to do with the real story of Iwo and is a slap in the face to all the men, now gone, and their families who still grieve. Pbcohen"
3,A bit disappointing,"I'd read ""Flags of Our Fathers"" after the superb ""Flyboys,"" and perhaps it was only too easy to be disappointed. ""Flyboys"" is an amazing book, both focused on the immediate and on the greater picture; even for people who've read plenty of history, there are fresh revelations on every page.""Flags of our Fathers,"" on the other hand, is a much more conventional history book, much more narrowly focused. Bradley does do a good job of reaching beyond his father, as he didn't have to do; but he doesn't do a particularly good job of bringing readers into the moment, or of putting them into the greater context.The story of the men in the famous -- almost ignored -- photo is one that could be told, and should have been told, and was told well enough in ""Flags of our Fathers."" It's just hard not to wish for something a bit more, as when the author caught his voice in ""Flyboys."""
3,Good but a little slow,"I did enjoy this book, but it is far from my favorite. Those expecting biography type work will enjoy; those looking for a book about Iwo Jima won't exactly be disappointed, but only about 1/3 of the book is about the battle itself. I guess the dust jacket makes that clear, but I still was surprised at how slowly the begining and end moved."
5,Broadening the record of the Pacific War,"The details of the events on Iwo Jima provide a jumping off point for the author's long-term project exploring the genesis of the Pacific War and its later impact on the lives of the participants. This and subsequent volumes are must-reads for students of the period, whether or not they are sympathetic to his intent or views. The entire project is a worthy tribute to his father, who wisely deflected and reshaped the celebrity thrust upon him by his accidental presence at the moment an iconic photograph was snapped in the heat of the Iwo Jima carnage into a lifetime of service to his community and to formation of his children's characters. The son's life work as an historian is a far greater glory to Corpsman Bradley's life than his appearance as one of the figures in the icon of the Iwo Jima flag raising or its bronzed larger-than-life version at the edge of the National Cemetery at Arlington could ever be."
2,Editor Wanted!,The book is filled with redundancy and would have benefited greatly from a good editor. All in all still a good read.
1,this book sucks,I tried to read this book and i couldnt do it. This book sucks balls!!!!! i am sorry but its just so boring.
2,Disappointed,"I am not sure if it is the fact that the Audiobook is an abridged version but I just didn't find the story that compelling. Somewhat repetitive and too concerned about details which I found boring and uninteresting.I was looking for a historical account (like the much better ""1776"" or ""Team of Rivals"") but this is more like an afterschool special."
4,Flags of our Fathers,Very good book that is not typical for a World War II topic. Explore the personalities of the Iwo Jima Flag Raisers. I would recommend this book to those wanting more information about the people behind the famous photograph.
5,Invasion Iwo Jima,"Enjoyed this book immensely. Helped me to understand how deadly this island assault was with huge loss of life and casualties. Book is well written describing each of the men who raised the flag on Iwo Jima and the far reaching effects it would have on lives of those that survived the war. Unfortantely, we have little regard for our fighting men and women compared to WWII. There is a regard but the unity we had in WWII is not always there. I recommend this book highly for those who want to understand the Pacific Theater of war. We get to see the grusome and brutal tactics of the Japanese against the Americans. The assualt was an endless slaughter of the US Marines who had no real cover and unable to see the Japanese who were down in caves."
5,I am in my Glory with my New CD,"I love George Michaels and I am Mary J. Blige's #1 Fan. This union of my two favorite artist is a magnificent one. This remake of Stevie Wonder's ""As"" is quite soulful. Mary J. Blige truly has no limits. Her voice continues to touch my heart with her unique soulfulness. This CD is a ""must-have""."
1,"Yet another failed ""business""/sports book","I am very tired of the attempts of coaches and athletes trying to relate their experiences to the rest of the population dealing with normal business/corporate life. I have yet to find any such book that is worth buying. In his latest, Pitino touched a nerve, in particular, with me because he really has not accomplished anything in Boston. He has had time to build that ""house of cards"" of a team. He must have finished this book during this past outstanding season. He should have written a book on negotiation/interviewing...""How to make 7 million a year, while making a fool out of Red Auerbach""P.S. --Coaching men is different than bossing kids around at Kentucky."
2,Amazon Product Details Misleading,"The Amazon Product Details for this book don't match the book itself. According to Amazon (January 2011), the publication date is 1929. I thought I was ordering the original first edition of the book. But the book turned out to be the much edited second edition in a new printing (2008) with an entirely new ISBN number. (I am returning the book to Amazon.)In my experience the version edited by Swami Kriyananda is much closer to the spirit in which Yogananda wrote Whispers from Eternity. The Kriyananda version is also much more complete with ""Samadhi"" included as well as a number of longer poems and chants. (Crystal Clarity Publishers, Nevada City, CA, 2008) The book is fairly flowing with Yogananda's devotional spirit, but that version isn't showing up on Amazon at this time."
2,RPG fan....but not of this game,"When I first began to play the game I thought it was cool. However, after awhile it grew monotonous. The picture is too dark to see anything. Even if you lighten it up it is too dark, any glare in the room ruins the whole picture. The graphics are okay but overall not a good game for such a high price!"
2,Not what I hoped for,"This book covers the enitre female body, mind, and home. It's a very nice way for Christian women to sit down and realize how amazing they really are.However, it failed to reach out and grab the ideas on the back cover.Based on the claims that this book put foreward, I was expecting it to focus more on what to DO with your man; not who to be. I already love my rockin' Godly body, and I already know having a clean home is a plus. What I really wanted from these 101 things were more specific, action-oriented ways to ensure I was doing the best I could to keep him happy.If you have never had any relationship adive, though, I do highly reccomend this book to you, as well as Make Every Man Want You."
3,Pudo haber sido mejor,"Conociendo de la calidad y los antecedentes de este señor, creo que este album pudo haber dado mas, se trata de un concierto acustico, en un club e la gran manzana que resume toda la historia musical de este señor que es uno de los grandes y que ha tocado solo en grandes bandas y que ha escrito y producido grandes clasicos, sin embargo el audio y la calidad musical del disco no es la ideal, lo que hace que el album pierda valor, sin embargo es innegable que John Wetton canta y toca con el corazon, y eso lo hace que sea grande como siempre lo ha sido, aparte de eso los musicos que lo acompañan como Ian Macdonald y Martin Orford son musicos de cinco estrellas."
2,I could have made it myself for less...and did.,"Why did I spend $20+ for this?Not sure why I had to have it so badas to send off for 3 bucks worth of stuffI could buy at the hardware store. Since itwas taking longer than usual to recieve thisthrough snail-mail, I decided to go down to mylocal nut & bolt supplier ans see what I couldfind to fill in while I waited...Eureka! I foundall I needed for $3.42 incl. tax. In fact, the oneI built looks cooler and works better--i.e. morestable and secure though extended firing conditions.Think I might start manufacturing these and sellingthem for much less than competition...hmmm :)"
3,"Mildly entertaining, a masterpiece it's not","I find it odd that the bulk of the high praise comes from the Seattle Washington area, but since the author is from the same area perhaps not that odd at all. It's good to support your friends but let us not skew the facts.I thought what the hey I'll give it a read might get a laugh, it was readable, I snickered a time or two. I find it falls far short of 5 stars. I mean let's be real it's a nice short read with no real revolations. Pretty much part of the ebay 15 minutes of fame ride from the wedding dress auction.Read it if you want it's mildly entertaining book I'd give it 2 1/2 stars at best, but out of kindness and the fact that Amazon doesn't have a 2 1/2 rating it gets 3."
1,"Horrible product, skips and not water resistent",I've never owned such an awful portable CD player. In the first five months I took it jogging every day and it would skip every other day (jogging over fairly even ground). Also it is not water resistent as advertised. I took a jog in a very light shower with it. Not more than 20 drops got on the CD player and now the audio jack is dead and Sony wants $70 minimum for the repair.
5,One of the best games---period.,"If you dont buy this game you are surely crazy. This game is one of the best games (and I am a true gamer) that I've ever played. Once you sit down, and play the clock keeps ticking and pretty soon you know it, you've been playing for 3 hours. This game is highly addictive, and everytime your at the computer you want to play. Westwood Online has created online gaming, (which is all I play.) All three of my friends and I play all the time online, (but I must warn you...you must have a high speed internet connection to enjoy the online gaming.) This is one of the best games period. So go ahead! Press BUY!"
2,WHAT WAS I THINKING,I will tel you the game didn;t suck but i exppected a much better show from Westwood. This is the worst in the series. All the units are the same from Red Alert except with new graphics and a few weaponry tweeks. There are some NEW types of units but there not great either. Every now in then I can get into a game but overall its good for a few plays. A few resons why u might want to try it. NEW TO C&C. If you haven't played many or any C&C games this I'll fill u for a while. Might even make you buy other C&C games.(then you'll realize what a waste it is) But if you know C&C I beg you stay away.
2,Dont bother,"Well, if you have Red Alert 2 - or are trying to get into the C&C world - this is not where you need to go. Red Alert 2 is WAY better. As for TS - its repetative, meaning once you beat both clans (you are one, or the other - and thats IT) missions (if you bother) you will probably never play it again. There are no add ons worth a darn, there are no special units to get excited over...its confusing, its slow, it has silly premesis behind it, and- its just no fun...PS: I have been told to stay away from GENERALS too - RA2 forever!"
4,Put a whole new look at strategy games!!,"I loved this game. I saw the video clips and it was fantastic. I have played a beta version at my friends house and it was better than ALL other strategy games. The graphics ,special effects and movies blew me away. If you like Command and conquer (any of them), than this is the game for you. Even if you don't like command and conquer this game will really surprise you!!"
1,Tiberian slow it should be called,"I thought Red Alert was one the best games ever (well, at least until Starcraft and half life came around) and I was really looking forward this. I was pretty disapointed. Some nice bells and whistles in the game but the addition of 3D didn't add all that much to the experience in my mind. It looks great but the I found the play to be lethargic..even at the high game speeds. I also found it more difficult to distinquish which units were which at times than in Red Alert. It also seems that many of the missions seem to be commando missions where you race your forces accross the map with periodic replacement troops instead of more build you base and then attack missions. I was so disapointed with this game, I gave up after the tenth GDI mission. Life is too short to play bad games like this."
3,Man this game sucked.,"I'll keep it short and sweet. If you are a new fan of RTS games then you will find this game to be a masterpiece and for sure buy it. It will entertain you for months. If you are familiar with the Command & Conquer series, then this game sucks."
5,Tiberian Sun kicks!,"I have noticed that most people believe that Tiberian Sun is a sequel to C&C: Red Alert. This is not true. Red Alert was written as a PREQUEL to the original C&C and happens during WW2. Tiberian Sun then picks up a little while after where C&C left off. The best twist in the game is that Kain (NOD leader) is back, although the truth about his death in C&C 1 is a little mixed up. The graphics have been improved tremendously, the maps are larger, and new awesome units have been added. The storyline is not as intriguing as the other two C&C games, but it is a good story line also. In my opinion, Tiberian Sun was the best RTS of 1999. If you have the other C&C games, it is a must own. If you don't have the other C&C games, or are debating between Red Alert and Tiberian Sun, BUY THIS ONE!"
3,Good,"This game used to be one of my favorites, not the best, but one of them trick attack was my favi, i just wish i had some of those skills back. This is a 2 player game and its kind of fun racing your friends down a mountain. I just don tlike how if you land wrong you loose health"
4,a classic 64 game,"For N64 this game is way fun. The races aren't too hard to beat and riding the penguin cracks me up. Obviously the graphics and controls aren't perfect because it's an older game, but it's for 64 so what more do you want? It's totally kid friendly and considering how cheap it is I definitely recommend this game for your collection."
4,madden 99,"It was fun to play a game i grew up on. it is really hard though. i dont remember how i managed to score points when i was 10 yrs old haha. You can kind of do a fantasy draft in it, but the teams are limited."
3,A long run for a short slide,"I just can't get my head around this. I thought it would be engaging but that is not the case. I finished this book was by sheer willpower. It fails to deliver any power right up to the end. Oh well, I didn't have any great expectations for this book and was not disappointed. You can live without reading this book."
3,"Greatly Written, but loses some interest","Like most of Pressfield's work this book is exceptionally written and has a great plot with complex and interesting characters. The story loses interest at some points though, mainly during long political discussions which take up pages with monologues; and during strategic discussions which bring an interesting historical perspective but are not interesting or exciting to the story.""Gates of Fire"" is one of the best books I've ever read, and I have enjoyed everything from Pressfield, but to enjoy this book you have to enjoy the historic aspect as well because the plot alone is dry for long stretches.Overall, I would definatly reccomend it for a fan of the period, or anyone who wants to learn about the Peloponnesian War with some fiction thrown in for entertainment."
2,Disappointing...,"When this book arrived, I eagerly dove into it, hoping that it was at least close to the gripping ""Gates of Fire"" I had read so many times. Sadly, I was much disappointed. This novel is more about political issues and a personal quest for glory than it is about men in combat. And while for certain people that may be interesting, for me the absence of the combat depictions and the seemingly endless political maneuvering made this book very tedious to read. Steven Pressfield is a very intelligent individual and a gifted writer, and my dislike for this book is more a testament to my inflexibility than it is to any fault in its creation. But I still didn't like it."
2,Shockingly dull,"I was surprised how shockingly dull this book was compared to his ""Gates of Fire."" This is a book desperately searching for a plot. One can get a better picture of Alcibiades reading a ""traditional"" history (Donald Kagan's ""The Peloponnesian War"" is highly recommended). Read ""Gates of Fire"" or ""The Last Amazon"" instead. You will be disappointed if you buy this book."
2,The Tides of Ware Is A Real Bore!,"Having been captivated by 'Gates of Fire,' my anticipation of another brilliant Pressfield Greek epic crumbled within fifty page. Trust me, the story and characters were rich. Alcibiades is probably the most complex character among the ancients. We get to see him from friend, foe and from his own words. Some of the battle descriptions, especially at Syracuse, are chilling.So what's wrong? It'sthe voice! Pressfield attempted to narrate in a grueling dialect. This murderous attempt on phonetic accuracy puts a spear into the pace and robs the suspension of disbelief. Rather than absorb myself into the Spartan lifestyle or Athens democracy, all I hear is Pressfield yelling ""I speak Greek."" Oh well, there is always Alexander the Great, Mr. Pressfield. Please tell the story next time!"
3,I got bored,"I really liked his earlier work Gates of Fire.This book I though was okay. It is very similar in style. They both deal with a man explaining what happened. Athenian political I did not find so interesting. And I though it was too long. Towards the end I felt that it was an effort to finish it.I would suggest it would be more profitable to spend your time reading Thucydides ""History of war""."
2,Snore,"I'm a 45 year old reader with miliary service, a graduate degree and I love to read philosophy, history, everything I can get my hands on. In my opinion, this book is void of reward. Gates of Fire was saved because Pressfield can write about a battlefield (if little else). Tides of War de-emphasized the battles in favor of I don't know what. Skip it or check it out at the library if you must see for yourself."
2,Ruthless personal ambition,"Where Pressfield's other Greek book, Gates of Fire, was about thoughtful devotion and total dedication, Tides of War is about boundless lust for power.Alcibiades, the novel's main object of study, never relents. He strives for more and more and takes it, until there's nothing left to take. Then his benefectors and followers realize something's wrong and Alcibiades must find another venue to plunder.He's very charming, but we the readers know better than the characters in the novel, and we never trust him or really like him.I couldn't figure out what Pressfield wanted to show with this novel. The message I got (ruthless ambition leading to disaster) seems trite. Alcibiades's continual rejoinder that he simply follows the goddess of Necessity, just doesn't jibe. Tides of War has none of the nobility that we find in Gates of FireStill, I give it one star for the writing, and one star for the period piece. Thucydides beckons."
1,Unreadable!,"I can not begin to say how disappointed I am in this book. Gates of Fire was one of my favorite books of all time. It was so exciting, so eye-opening. I could not put the book down.And I waited and waited for Pressfield to write his next book. And finally it came. The Tides of War a fictional look at the wars between Sparta and Athens. I could not wait. Pressfield did such a great job novelizing the Persian Wars I could not wait for this book.Maybe my hopes were too high. This book was such a let down. The narrators within narrators made this book unreadable.Gates of Fire is an awesome book. Unfortunately for whatever reason Pressfield could not match it.This book was going to be the book for the summer. And instead, it was the major disappointment of my summer reading.What happened?"
1,Worst of 2001,"Song structures are nonsense, the sound is overblown, the vocals are pretentious, and the lyrics are sophomoric. Don't be fooled by the Thrill Jockey imprint -- this is not post-rock, it's not innovative, and it's not worth a dime. I can't understand the fan following. To me it seems to be hipster-ism at its worst, liking unpopular stuff just because it's unpopular. I certainly don't get it. To me, this was a waste of [amt](minus the [amt] store credit in trade)."
2,"Short, no real depth, a guy selling himself","This guy is the real deal, a real former terrorist. Hence, two stars for being a true story. However, it's basically a sell job by the guy. I like the guy, he's honest, but I didn't get much from his story. He sits in a red chair and tells his story. And it's only 32 minutes long. Sorry...I was looking for some more insights into Islam and the terrorist mind. He can't give that because it is too painful, I think."
1,Can't throw a spiral - or RANT for that matter,"His hands are too small. Don't read this book, just turn down the sound to Monday night football and enjoy the game."
1,he is a disgrace!,"I am so sick of this guy going on Leno all the time. All he does is selfishly talk about him self and not care for others. And to state Bill and Hillary are still married for ""CONVENIENCE""? P-lease! To say something like that would be ubsurd, because the only people who know the truth are Bill and Hillary, who to my knowledge are still married. His comments regarding the enviornment are TRULY un-called for. ""Get out of a tree and get a job."" First off, I happen to be an enviornmentalist but I have a job. Sorry we don't make $1,000,000,000 a year publishing books based on our rants and go on talk shows blabbering like a 2-year-old. Republicans laugh at Al Franken for being ""childesh"" (and how hypocritical by previously saying liberals are ""Name-callers""?) when they have this fellow to look at. I mean for God's sake he's voting for Arnold! Shouldn't that say enough?"
4,"Very Funny, Pure Dennis","If you like Dennis Miller on HBO, you will of course enjoy this book. I rarely get a chance to see his show so this book was perfect for me.When Miller was making headlines this summer with his addition to MNF I thought I'd get his latest rants. I was glad I did. The thing I like about this book is that you can pick it up at anytime and have yourself a good laugh. Each chapter is only 4-5 pages long. You don't have to remember what you read the last time you picked up the book because each chapter is a different rant.The only thing I didn't like about this book is that it is all from the tv show. So there is no original material here. If I happened to have seen that episode the book isn't quite as funny.Overall, if you are a Dennis Miller fan, it is definitely worth the price. But that's just my opinion, I could be wrong!"
4,Works for me.,I would definitely recommend this book for ASP beginners. The progression through topics was logical for the most part and the level of detail will get you started developing simple prototype and basic applications. It lays enough of a foundation to understand how ASP pages work allowing you to progress without any other assistance other than using the standard on-line references shipped with ASP development software like Interdev. There are obvious errors that present hurdles throughout the book but they are only as high as your problem solving skills are low.
3,Hasn't stood the test of time.,"When the game Rainbow Six came out, it was praised for being so revolutionary, realistic, and grondbreaking. Unfortunetly, not only were these claims exaggerated, but the game does not look nearly as good now as it did in 1997.Frankly, the graphics weren't terribly good in 1997 either. Games like Half-Life and Total Annihilation were coming out at the same time, and they still look great today. Moreover, there never was much semblance of a plot, and the AI (both friendly and enemy) is abyssmal.However, the game is still enjoyable, the levels still unique and well-designed, the weapons (although with the notable exception of the shotgun they all function essentially the same way) fun to use.Although the original rainbow six pales in comparison to essentially every game that has followed it, it isnt a bad thng to pick up in a bargain bin for some quick entertainment. 5/10"
1,Huge Design Flaw,"If you will notice on the bottom right side of the photo there is a see-through chamber to see how much water you've poured in. Great idea. Poor execution. After just one use of this steamer I washed it, dried it, and put it away. The next time I went to use it, I had a very thick layer of mold growing in the see-through chamber. If you live in a humid place, better take a pass on this steamer. There is no way to get inside the steamer and fully dry it out as it is a sealed compartment aside from a small hole that will let water in and out. This is a huge design flaw. So, after one use and a chamber full of mold that I was not able to remove, I ended up dumping this steamer in the trash can."
2,Yadda Yadda Yadda,"I've had the book for a good while now, but it's so much psychobabble. It just goes on and on with stories but no actual value (at least for me). A roulette system that really has worked out for me is the Roulette Cash Cow (do a google search) There are many other out there like Martingale and Andrucchi but Roulette Cash Cow is the best."
5,Wonderful album-- exploratory 'klezmer' plus',"I agree that Courvoisier's ABATON is a terrific album too-- & addition of Friedlander definitely changes the mood & 'palette.' However, with the Klezmer links here, the duetinterplay is perhaps a bit more 'accessible' and, well, lovely. SC shows a melodic side often only sketchy on other recordings-- not that I don't love her percussive worktoo (her recordings with 'Mephista' are wonderful that way).This shows a different side-- & also interesting to hear bothplayers as interpreters of JZ's subtle Masada work. No question he has expanded the 'klezmer' tradition, & this another fascinating chapter-- but also I think perfectly listenable in its own right to anyone who likes chamber jazz, or duet chamber music in general."
5,Excellent Book. Period !!,"Very useful book for query tuning, optimization etc.(for both SQL server and Sybase)Period."
3,Cool independent feature!,"John Specht (INSANIAC) brings you into an underground world of hired guns and conspiracy theory, told through the eyes of an apostate angel trying to rid the world of these ""bad"" people. As an independent moviemaker, Specht utilizes all of his assets to help bring this many-faceted story to life. The acting ranges from good to mediocre, but none of it detracts from the excitement. Paul Wendell's portrayal of Dimitri stands out in this movie as one of the better performances. I recommend checking this movie out."
2,Headphones do not hold up,I have had these for almost two years and I have found that they do not hold up well. The padding in the ears has flattened totally making them very uncomfortable. The headphone cord has become stiff so that I have to bend it away from my face. The biggest problem that has developed is creakyness. The headphones creak anytime you move. The creaking is loud and unpleasant and resonates inside the headphones. If you are trying to wear them while sleeping on a plane the creaking sound is very disturbing.The noise cancelling is good on a plane and the sound is good considering the price. However I would not buy them again because they have aged poorly.
1,Not good,"This book (especially the beginning) contains lots of unnecessary, story-like and useless text. I have read the first 70 pages and I hope the rest of the book is much better."
4,"Enjoyed it thoroughly, but one star behind Monkey Island 3.","I rate a game on how many deadends I hit, and for what reason I hit them. I only hit two in Grim -- the reason was not logic but a trick in character manipulation. I usually don't get tricked if there are logical reasons to pursue (the worst case of ""no logic"" is Lighthouse for example). The game was very entertaining and there were only a few ""aborts"" to deal with. I had no problems with elevators as mentioned in the editor's review. Still -- I enjoyed Rama and Monkey Island more than this one."
1,"Just stay far, far away from this game...","Of course, usually my expectations are low when I get a game for $10, especially a PS3 game, because there is usually a reason a game is that price.I'm not making it up when I say I have played SNES racing games (like Mario Kart, for one) that control FAR better than this game does. It's like every car is a tank and not a car at all. Graphically, this game is definitely an early gen game. I've seen some people mention online as a redeeming feature, just do yourself a favor and buy Blur if you want a true online experience (no other racer on the market lets you race 20 to a room).If you want some blowing up/action with your racing games, then go with Split/Second (which just had DLC released) or Blur. Don't waste your $10 on this game."
2,A secular man,"Jinnah was a brilliant constitutional lawyer and a secular man. His favorite food was pork sausage and fried potatoes, according to his private secretary. He never once said his namaz or kept fast. His fore fathers were hindu jat, according to Jinnah himself.Mr Akbar's book distorts truth or does not mention inconvenient truth.So it is a very poor history. Also he appears to be bigotted.He draws a parallel between pathans and Mr. Jinnah. That is absurd.He extols the virtues of pathans and puts down other people.Pathans may be courageous but they are also known to be foolhardy. The entire subcontinent is full of pathan jokes that exceeds Polish jokes.Jinnah was a cleam shaven modern man, there is no parralel between him and a illterate, bearded,relogious fanatic, marauding pathan.In fact the only attempt on Jinnah's life was made by a pathan.Thia book is poor history, not worthy of a noble character like Jinnah."
2,most of this sucks,"The good: I kind of like the track 'Daddy', compelling lyrics and they match Greg's huskier tones here.Pictures at an exhibition: Very effective, I really enjoy this one, although it does not really belong on the album.The rest: Verging from average (one by one) to rubbish (Thin line, Street war, etc, etc...)What a change from the really listenable 'Black moon', no ballads, acoustic guitars, piano, just boring synthesised nonsense."
4,Grows on You,"The heroine is sufficiently unique to grab you from the beginning. Character development takes a while, but once everyone is in place the interaction is very well done. I am looking foward to the movie that is scheduled to be made from this book."
5,Robert Crais-The Best!,"Robert Crais has got to be the best author writing today. I really didn't think I would like this book because I am such a fan of Elvis and Joe. This book was right up there with his previous work. Loved it. I really like it when the author throws in a character from a previous book. Like in this one, he mentions Samantha Dolen, the cop who got killed in L.A. Requim. I kept thinking he was going to mention Elvis and Joe but it never happened. This was an excellent read. Trying to figure out the Pell character kept me on my toes. I highly recommend it!"
3,A encyclopedia collection of spreads,"Yes, there are many spreads, only a few is suitable for me, you would have to try and pick to see the effect. the explanation is not clear enough for me. Just okay. There are many subtitutes of these kind of spreads book, even the Internet search will do."
4,book,this book has 100 spreads to do and try. doesn't have the reversed meanings in it but the spreads are wonderful. also another great gift for someone.
5,My favorite tarot book,"This is my favorite tarot book, unlike any other on the market. Many of the spreads are completely original--I've never seen any like them anywhere else. They fit a vaste range of situations and questions. The book is also one of the best on intepreting the meaning of the cards that I've found.I would highly recommend it to any and all interested in tarot."
5,AWESOME - INTERESTING - Must be read!,One of my favorite tarot books. Has wonderful spreads that really pin point answers to the most asked questions. Very easy to follow and enjoyable.
5,The best book for pastor's wives or any lay woman!,"Excellent, insightful....the best book for christian women written!"
5,Great!,"To start, i rented this game cause their was nothin else to get and i was hooked right away! I got a huge fine for not returning it. I finally own it now and all i can say is it is a great game. You start with nothing and enter the tower. you should find a weapon soon but it wont be to good. you continue going through the tower getting money and rare items. it is full of subquests. you get to go out with 7 different girls; at the same time! and take them to the pool. hehehe. and you can build your town into a big city with monster races and a casino. it has great replayability. i have been playing for 127 hours and still counting. dont play this game if you dont plan on buying it because you WILL get hooked!"
5,Customer VALUE management nails it!,"As an MBA professor, author, and customer service consultant, I had the opportunity to review early drafts of Ray's excellent book. This is a gem. It nails the importance of building customer VALUE. It ties together a rationale for company efforts to serve, satisfy, and create loyalty with the customers who determine the success of the business. The writing is clear and straightforward and the content invaluable for any business person interested in boosting the bottom line (and who isn't?)Congratulations to Ray and Janice for offering an excellent addition to our field of knowledge. I highly recommend this book."
1,It had the potential,"I read the back cover and was intrigued to know more, but was soon disappointed. Although it says that Lt. Worf and Counselor Troi are doing the investigating, but the extremely annoying Wesley Crusher is brought in to the picture half way through the book and manages to screw up the rest of the story. Not to mention the ending was very predictable. Not at all like previous books by Vornholt. I recommend Genesis Wave, if you want something good by this author."
2,A poor job by Vornholt,"I would say that this story is weak, a surprise from Vornholt. His work is usually much better than this, as he is one of my favorite ST authors. War Drums #23 was great! This story is also poorly read by Michael Dorn. Very predicatble story and nothing exciting to keep those pages turning. I'd pass on this one folks!"
5,You must have it!,"Descent the best book in the space. You must have it! Who love game series DESCENT, founded in this book all what want. The best design of this book give pleasure when get it in hands. Well, I'm happy have this book!"
2,Just ok,My fish seem to like it only a little. The thing I don't like is that is makes the bottom of my tankdirty because it dissolves very quickly.
2,"Fish love them, but they're an absolute mess.","These pellets are economical and fish do like them, but they have one HUGE drawback: they're filthy. In a matter of seconds in the tank they will begin to ""puff up"" and get soft, and start making a mess of your substrate. Even with the fish eating them, they can't keep it under control and just tend to create even more of a mess. These things will surely make a mess of your tank in no time if you don't clean up after your fish or if you don't under feed. If you are having any sort of health-oriented problem in your tank, from ammonia in the water to algae, one of the first things I'd do is stop feeding this stuff and start feeding a quality, clean food like any number of other pellets available by other companies.These are best avoided, only use them if you are in a pinch or to offer something different on a rare occasion for your fish. I'll never buy them again."
2,Am I missing something?,"I can't believe that many of the reviews for this book use the words ""well written"". I enjoy mystery, suspense, and intertwined romance like everyone else but this was lame, lame, lame. The characters were beyond superficial. If you hadn't read the previous books by this author which featured some of these characters, you were totally clueless about Eve, her adopted daughter Jane, what happened to Bonnie, etc. So you felt like you were truly in the dark. And the dog/wolf romance - come on! The romance didn't sizzle, and the story line was preposterous. I don't think the attention this author is getting from the public is warranted."
5,Fantastic Service!,This was a gift for a friend. It arrived on time and in mint condition. Great Job!
1,Stupid!,One of the dumbest books I have ever read. The author knows nothing about search dogs and makes it apparent.
2,Not very thrilling . . . .,"This was my first Iris Johanson book (actually I listened to the audio tape). I did not find this to be much of a thriller -- in fact it is nothing more than a mediocre romance. The plot was contrived, unbelievable and the story just did not sustain my interest. I didn't care for Cynthia Nixon's narration -- she portrayed Sarah as a whiny woman with a huge chip on her shoulder, and Logan as a macho idiot. The best and most likeable character was Monty, the dog (although the dog/wolf story was totally ridiculous!) My advice is not to bother with this one. Since I only listened to this while exercising, it wasn't too much of a waste of my time."
5,The Search - Found It's Mark,"Iris Johansen's ""The Search"" is fabulous. The intertwining of several story lines keeps the listener riveted. Unlike many other mystery books, this one has realistic plots and happenings and constantly keeps the listener on edge. I love the fact that it was challenging to anticipate what would happen next. An A++++ book that I highly recommend. I can't wait to listen to all of Johansen's others."
4,This is by far the best first person shooter i ever played..,This game plain and simple is very fun. I enjoy using the magnum to the heads of all the scientists in the starting of the game. This is bye far the best AI i have ever played.....
1,not compatible with Windows XP,"I hate to say this? but this game is not compatible with Windows XP OS, so owners of newest Dell computers have to install compatible OS."
5,GAME OF THE CENTURY,"This game is for any gamer! this is the ultimate game i mean look at the storyline, graphics and everything else! no lag in multiplayer and pcgamer gave it a 97% rating!!! three words can rate this game IT'S DA BOMB!!!!!!"
5,One of the best PC games I've seen in years.,"It's brilliant. What more is there to say? It's a fun imaginative shoot 'em up with endless posibilities, kill evil aliens and government agents or for some humour, kill some scientist with almost endless fun and ways in this amazing and detailed game. Half Life is so popular there are thousands of addons, and don't forget its brilliant multiplayer game (deathmatch and team). But, don't take my word for it! For a little peak, download the demo, I'm sure you'll want more. A well earned 5/5"
2,short and overprices,"Video makes no mention of site preparation (excavating,tamping,compaction etc etc)There is no mention of theuse of gravel or reinforcing steel mesh that are used inconventional concrete work.The sidewalk/driveway videois also very short (approx 30 minutes) ...overall Ifeel this video is overpriced and a good book from anylocal library would far surpass any ""secrets"" to befound in this video."
4,It Serves its purpose,"Overall this is a notebook that is specifically designed for a laboratory work (as stated in its name).The pages and its copies are numbered. Graphing sheet paper is used. The margins are decent as well as the header. The spine of both of mine started coming apart after 2 semesters of use, but it did sustain some hard handling. The one thing that is lacking is the ability to tear out originals and copies well. The carbon copy is hard to tear out evenly, while the original is not possible without scissors. I know that originals are supposed to be kept in place, but each professor has his/her own demands."
3,"Good, but not Great","Robbins still turns a phrase and twists metaphors like Britney Spears wiggles her belly button. However, this book was like X-mas after you've opened all the presents... you're real happy about the GI Joe, but you really wanted a ten-speed. Still he's funny as all hell and knows his subject inside an out - sure the main character Switters is an annoying, offensive, crash blow-hard. But I laughed. All things considered, a big improvement over his last book (Half Asleep in Frog Pajamas). I would strongly suggest Skinny Legs and All and Even Cowgirls Get the Blues before this one, though."
1,A chore to finish it.,"Robbins spends to much time rambling on in this one. The story is nice, if a bit overtly contrived to get his point(s) across, but he should have put it in a package about half the size."
1,not this time,"I was extremely dissappointed by this Robbins Novel. I would not recommend this book to anyone with a young daughter, nor anyone with social conscious. Most of TR's books are borderline on who they poke fun at, but this one went too far on the pedofilia front. I hope the next novel falls closer to his previous ware, but may be afraid to take that chance."
1,Cowgirls this ain't,I've read all of TR's novels and eagerly awaited this one. What a bust! I got about half way through it and just put it down - never to return.
3,Out of gas,"I'm a big Tom Robbins fan. But, I think Tom is running out of gas. Certainly Fierce Invalids did. It has all the promise of Robbins' great and uniquely quirky world view, as well as his one-of-a-kind language stylings -- and then it seems like he rushed to finish it. Maybe his publisher wanted copy. Maybe he just ran out of brilliance. In the end, this is a great writer running out of gas."
5,What a joyride!,"I've never read Robbins before this one, but will certainly read more. He brings tremendous perspective from angles entirely new to me. The action is somehow absurd and plausible at the same time. Switters is marvelous, as are all the supporting characters, especially the loveable and smart Domino. There's also a delightful exchange (written pre-9/11) between Switters and some misguided radical Muslims."
4,"I liked it, and that bothers me...","This was my first Tom Robbins novel. I borrowed it from my 24-year old daughter who reads all of his books (she especially loves ""Jitterbug Perfume"").I have to say I was bothered by the pedophilia, but not nearly as much as I was bothered by the main character trying to convince the reader why it's okay. And trying to convince again, and again, and...But it was a fast moving story, fun insight on Catholicism, and just plain wacky situations, though it got a little wordy. Sometimes, I just wanted to shout, ""Shut up!"" Still, I would recommend this book, but not to the prude..."
5,Great trip!,Tom Robbins seems to only get better as time goes by. Hysterical action and quirky characters as usual. Can't hardly find a more enjoyable read.
5,Only Four More Years,"How can 59,054,087 people be so dumb? That's a question the other 55,949,407 of us who didn't vote for Dubya will be pondering for some time to come. While you're waiting this out, patiently or otherwise, you should be reading Stone's very funny and surprisingly upbeat new book. His message is clear. Don't let this defeat get you down. Remember, it's only four more years."
4,A Helpful Dose Of Humor In This Time Of Great Despair,"THE BUSH SURVIVAL BIBLE is undeniably a funny little book, providing very real comical pleasures that help to alleviate the horror most of us are currently feeling during what could very well be the absolute worst period in U.S. History. Gene Stone's book is not just a collection of Bush-isms and insult gags, however. It has an ultimately serious side--a Bush second term IS guaranteed to be disastrous for our country, after all. Stone offers some words of comfort and seems to truly believe that there are still many reasons for the American populace to feel a level of optimism about the country's future. Although an upbeat outlook on life at this moment in time might seem a tad naive, it is a refreshing view nonetheless in the midst of all the current wailing and whining from the left."
4,"Funny, Witty, Occasionally over-the-top","This book was published in November of 2004, just after George W. Bush had been very narrowly retained as President over John Kerry. Written from an openly anti-Bush viewpoint, the book mixes a nice dose of frustration, humor and wit. There are several anti-Bush jokes, ideas for coping, making good investments, and praying over how to get through the next four years. One of the concise chapters (they range from 2-7 pages in length) mentions rising Democratic politicians, most notably Elliot Spitzer (prior to his hooker scandal) and a state senator from Illinois just elected to the U.S. Senate, Barack Obama. There are also chapters on effective anti-depressants, Republicans even more scary than Bush, liberal-leaning groups one could join if so inclined, and how to tell when Bush is lying. A fast and witty read at just 122 pages, occasionally over-the-top, but mostly such good fun that even Republicans could get a chuckle from it."
5,Excellent but NOT LIVE,"This is probably my favorite compilation ever released. However, it is NOT LIVE. It was recorded at a studio in London. Listen to Sin City (track 7 on CD 1) at around 2:51... you can hear this neighing (like a horse) cheer looped 5 times. You can also hear other vocal snippets repeated. This was recorded in London. It is more evident when you consider that Oakey cannot mix NEARLY this well live :)."
5,great cd,"I am not a trance or even DJ guru, but this album is great. It is rare I think that an album is great all of the way through. This one is. I really enjoy the Eisbaer remix."
5,A striking and terrifying view of war and its aftermath,"These 22 short stories by Heinrich Böll are powerful and moving. Most of the stories are very short, ""The Casualty"" being the longest (40 pages in this edition). ""Vive La France"" gives a good description of the passing of time, and is a tense, atmospheric story. ""Beside the River"" is also especially good, the despair and hopelessness of the story is almost tangible, and the switching of narrators is well done. All in all, I was very impressed with these stories, and am surprised that they are not more widely read."
4,Bombing Banjo and Kazooie!,Banjo Kazooie is one of the best games i have ever played. This is the sort of game that steals your weekends and other free time. This is one of the best rated games evere and is exiting to play and watch.You never know what is next mabey another encounter with an enemy or mabey a jiggy. The first time i played this game i got angry with my mother for making me quite it is so suspensful i felt that i was going to explode. Banjo Tooie is also another great game. plz e-mail me. buzzy_d20@hotmail.com
4,"Fun gameplay, but stupid humor","I enjoy playing the game, but it contains a lot of crass, stupid jokes, such as shooting eggs out of one's back-end with a fart noise, and constant rhyming taunts from the witch. Also the music gets really old, really quickly."
1,Down down down!!!,"Up! is just the worst album Shania Twain released, especially that international version.What Happened to the Rock/Country feel?It might be fine with the green disc-even if I read that the country versions weren't that different from the pop versions-but really I haven't heard a song on that CD that vaguely caught my attention and I tried more than a couple of times.The melodies are simply stupid and none of the instrumental arrangements save the product.Talking about product, this is really a business release!Even Twain's beautiful voice is ruined by awful computarised effects.This would be for the POP CD, the WORLD versions are even worst...Indian Techno?Let Madonna do that type of mix, at least she's good at it!OK, Shania now that you have won the big money, why don't you do like the DIXIE CHICKS and go back to your roots?!"
2,"Good Shaver, but it doesn't last long","I bought this razor and was really happy with it. It gave a close shave, but as it neared the end of the warranty I noticed that it didn't seem to hold a charge for very long. I had assumed that it was just getting moved around on the charger, causing it to not charge. But within a few weeks after the warranty expired, the battery died, and would no longer charge at all. This was my second Panasonic Shaver, both of them lasted just a little longer than a year, before they became virtually unusable. I ended up going back to my nine year old Remington shaver after this shaver died, because it gave a better shave than my other Panasonic. They both gave a great shave, but if you are looking for something to last longer than a year, I would probably recommend a Remington."
4,Good for the price,"I purchased this razor when I had foot surgery as it wasn't very easy to shave in the shower any more. So I haven't tried it wet yet. The battery last surprisingly long, very easy to handle and clean. Charging set is convenient to use. This razor works okay for a quick shave, but it will not give a close shave. I haven't tried other electric razors so I wasn't sure what to expect. Not sure if you would be able to get a close shave from any electric razor. The style, ease of use and handling make this razor a good deal."
2,Not worth buying!,"I bought this shaver last year and it's really been a disappointment. It's my 1st electric shaver so I have nothing to compare it to, but it's never worked well. The shave under the arms or legs is anything but close and a regular razor works 100% better. Also I was getting bumps under my arms after shaving with this product. Now a year later, the battery is already dead and I'd have to replace the battery. It's not worth it to me and I'm going to dump this electric shaver and go back to the cheap razors. I guess you get what you pay for and do not recommend buying this shaver."
3,Hoped for more..,I purchased this for my wife. It works but requires several passes. I wasn't shocked or terribly dissapointed as you normally get what you pay for. Nice that it's wet/dry and rechargeable.
2,very disappointing,"This is constantly nicking, even though i keep it on the charger. And, it finally died, after a year. Even though it says it's charging, it has no power. I have been very aggravated with this shaver, and I hope the next one I purchase will be better!"
2,Didn't work that good.,"My wife didn't like this. We saw the great reviews but found it did not give a close shave. I guess everone has different skin types etc, so it may work better with others.She swiched back to a regular razor."
3,'Moll Flanders' with knobs on:),"This was kinda fun - despite the picture on the front cover which is a bit odd-looking. Lots of strangely erotic sex and, unlike a lot of porn these days, I found myself grinning in places.I don't usually like historical porn, but this worked. I read it on a flight from London to NYC, in one sitting - if you don't count the four visits to the loo. Worth a shot.."
1,good start - then dragged on - the quick finish,Like many others I liked to concept. Started off okay - then dragged on - then bam it was over. Would of liked less middle story and more end story.
4,Love Story,Hey ladies- here is a love story suitable for most everyone. Some times things just don't turn out like you plan.A great little read.I'd recommend it.
1,"NOT what I'd call ""Chick Lit""","I read this book, because it was in my ""funny chick lit"" list. There are reviews in Amazon and on the cover by other ""funny chick lit"" writers, Marian Keyes and Jane Green, who's books are funny & romantic. This wasn't.The main character is a shallow, cold, controlling, unpleasant (rich, but that's cool) figure. She schemes to divorce a nice guy she's been married to for 11 years to get engaged to a creep she dated in college. She matures at the end. Goodness!Who would read this book? It's not a self-help for shallow, cold, controlling, unpleasant women who wouldn't waste their time on this type of book anyway, and wouldn't see themselves in it even if they did read the book. It doesn't add anything delightful, entertaining or even enlightening. Not worth its ""chick lit"" tag."
2,not sure,I have not finished this book yet but I would have to just say that I am reading just to see what happens. I can't start a book and not finish it. It is not one of my favorites and it is not a bad book but for me it doesn't flow and pull me in like other books have. Read at your own risk!
4,Different read from most,"The premise is not the 'same old, same old' for romance stories. It hit you on all emotions. I did not think it was hilarous by any means, but after about 3/4 the way through, I could not put it down. The moral of the story is the grass is not always greener....."
5,Returning to Good Memories and Starting New Ones,"I used to watch this video when I was a kid, mostly for the music, but the story and visuals were just as impacting.When I started dating my one and only girlfriend I made her watch this with me and listen to the music. She loved it too :) We got married about a year later and I told her that I want to have one of our kids in April so that we can play April Child to them and they can grow up loving this music too. Hopefully returning to it to remind them how life has its bright spots that we need to hold on to, just like I have for all these years. This is some of the greatest music I have heard in my life. Don't judge it by sound or voice only but by how it literally effects you in your soul. It's weird, but true :)"
5,Very helpful book!!!!,"This book helped me get through Pathophysiology. When you are learning about Fluids and Electrolytes, it really breaks it down into an easier to understand format. The quizzes and questions at the end of the book are also helpful. They do not only give you the correct answer but also tell you why it is correct. I would reccommend it to any nursing student, even if your program does not require Patho!"
4,A welcome addition...,"... to the chamber music catalog. Arthur Foote was a prominent Boston composer in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, much influenced by Brahms. He excelled at chamber music and I think these works are quite representative. For those who know and like his works, Naxos has issued a three volume survey of great merit. The Copland pieces will probably seem more familiar and are equally wothwhile. Boston is exceptionally blessed with classical music performing talent and these performers represent the highest standards. A solid recommendation for the more adventurous."
3,"Fun, light weight read--nothing more","This book is one of those great summer reads. Nothing too deep but still enough twists and turns to keep it exciting. I found the HUAC stuff and descriptions of life in a communist country in the late sixties to be fascinating. Yeah, I agree with everyone else that picking out the villian is way to easy but who cares? This is not a great work of fiction but a FUN one."
3,"A good book, but easy to decipher","The Prodigal Spy is well written, hooking the reader to the end. However, the plot is paper thin, and like most of the other reviewers, I knew what the conclusion would look like. My major concern is that there is a major loophole in the story, concerning the location of a certain object, and how Nikku knew it would be there. If anyone can enlighten me personally as to where in the book Nikku finds out that the object would be hidden there, then please email me and let me know. On the whole, I'd recommend the book, as it stands apart from most spy books, though not as good as le carre. Good book, shame about the obvious plot."
4,Blast from the past,"This game was, and has continued to be my favorite Crash game ever. You get to be eiher cocoa or Crash depending on the level you choose, and you collect gems and crystals depending on different ways you beat the level, has secret levels within each. The only thing I've been finding annoyance with is the secret levels you get for getting a certain number of Crystals and Gems. Also, comes with a Spyro demo if you hit the write button combination, the combination is in the booklet."
4,Another one!,"This one is the best of the 3. I like the racing levels. THis game was a bit more challenging, but it's still fun."
5,the funnest and most challenging gam i ever played!,"anyone hwo owns a playstation has to get this game! it is a skill game and it takes braines! the graphics are amazing! the bosses are tuff, and i'tse the best!"
5,This is the best ps1 game ever.,"I would say this is one of the the best ps1 games ever. I play it on my ps3.It is fun from riding a tiger to running around spinning bad guys. This is child friendly but also adults love it.It has good graphics, good gameplay, good ideas and lots of levels and replay value. Get this you won't miss out."
4,Great game!,"Crash 3 is the best out of all the series! Although I haven't finished the game with full percentage, it's still cool just playing the levels you've already beaten, trying to collect the gems or relics!"
5,Exellent! The most greatest adventure game on Playstation!,"Crash Bandicoot: Warped is the best game to hit the stores since... EVER! Ok, well, maybe I'm exadurating, nothing can top Silent Hill, but I'm talking about games like Sonic and Mario... Crash beats 'em all! Amazing graphics, great voice-overs, and moves from beating bosses are the best! Crash 3 is a must-have!"
2,Jackass it's not...,"I'm a fan of all associated with Jackass, cKY, Mike Vallely, Bam Margera, Steve O, etc, but this DVD let me down. I don't usually expect ANYTHING when i buy one of these DVD so usually i'm impressed but this was a poor (Jackass) attempt. It's not overly funny, it's like when you get your first video camera and you make a video of various stuff, and play around with the setting, etc, that is what this DVD is like.If your a HUGE and i mean HUGE Wee-Man fan, consider buying this, but if your just a fan of Jackass and associates, dont bother."
2,pretty big,not sure why i bought this - i'd had the single serving one for ages and when i moved i guess it got left behind - bought this one but have never used - way too big - will probably give away as a gift - not sure what i was thinking when i bot
1,Grill Size & Floating Hinge are NOT TRUE,"This is my second George Foreman grill. I purchased this one in order to grill rueben sandwiches. The grill is inadequate in two areas of the description: size of the grill and the amount of floating hinge. Another Reviewer has already described the misleading phrase, ""36 inch grilling surface"". when the real surface is 6"" by 6"". Another description, ""1 1/2 inch floating hinge"" is a LIE. At the most, the hinge raises 1/4 of an inch. THIS GRILL IS TOTALLY INADEQUATE FOR MY NEEDS."
4,No more greasy stove!,"This is a great product for a single person. Salmon, chicken, pork chops, hamburgers are simple to cook. The only disappointment is that hot dogs and brats want to slide off and take a little persuading to stay in the unit. The food cooks without drying out and the grease catcher does a great job."
2,Keeps slipping,"They should have made the bottom of this insole adhesive, so that it would stay in one spot. Unfortunately, they did not, and since it's a ""short"" insole (not meant to cover entire sole of shoe), it slides around underfoot. I suggest you use extra strength tape, or find an insole with an adhesive bottom."
4,As advertised. Pure and simple.,"It does the job solid, cleans up smoothly and with the occasional oops... the burns clean out with only about 15% ""elbow grease"" on some of the big burns the kid's have experienced so far. I've got one small beef with the design why couldn't the vent direct the pressurized heated/steamed air straight up? All the time I'll have to adjust the pot so it vents to a cloth, paper towel, or rag. That's it... other then that I'd buy another one. May end up Mcgyvering a 90 degree duct for the vent/switch thingy."
3,Space Battles ad nauseum,"In this books we are treated to space battle after space battle, boring. I skipped over half the book and I felt that I had missed nothing.Quit the missile salvos and cut to the mustard!"
2,"Poorly written, repetitive, and with terrible book binding","I was really let down by this book. Contrary to what others have said I do NOT believe it was anywhere near as good as starship troopers and armor. The story felt repetitive and did not flow well. Not to mention the quality of the book itself was terrible. Each page fell out as I read it. I would NOT suggest this book. Instead read Starship Troopers, Armor, Dune, or Enders game."
3,"Good War, Bad Propaganda","I wish the authors had studied the psychology of military leaders as assiduously as they studied their tactics. Here we have captivating naval battle sequences surrounded by hawkish didacticism. As cliched as the evil bugs are (how nice to have aliens devoid of anything redeemable so there is no moral ambiguity in this straw-man war) the military geniuses populating this book are even more so. Each one is a bland hero, universally competent, suitably burdened by command and tediously self-sacrificing. Really? Doesn?t sound like any general I know. And where are the grunts, wondering about their fates? Where are the incompetents, the vainglorious generals who have directed the flow of history? The authors have a very dull ax to grind: warriors good, politicians bad. Yet, I enjoyed the battles enough to recommend this book. Just read the Forever War or even Ender?s Game afterwards as a tonic."
4,A fast paced..militarily descriptive novel,I thought the novel very good.In military terms it was very descriptive and I felt the authors had displayed a great deal of imagination in writing it.It kept my interest thruout the story.I would recommend it to all military scf-fi fans!
4,Well written page turner... no warning for a long wait,"While this is one of the best books I have seen which combine the work of two authors, I did find the unexpected need of a sequel sadley disappointing. Still I would suggest this read if you enjoyed Crusade."
4,Wait for the 2nd book,"A good page turning military sci-fi book set in the STARFIRE universe. Not real deep on character development, but a lot of action and carnage. This book ends with a To Be Continued....., so wait for the second installment because this one leaves you hanging."
4,Great writing-- 622 pages gets you half way there!,"As a fan of David Weber, I wasn't disappointed. Great detail and creative twists to the battles and strategies. Character development was wonderful. Alas, like many other Weber books, we are left hanging at the end. Weber and White set up many characters that have yet to fulfill their destinies, and the Bugs are still ""at the gate"". At 3AM today, I was left looking for the sequel!"
4,Where's the rest of the story?,"As with their previous collaberations, I found this book to be interesting, exciting and extremely hard to put down. Also, as a retired sailor, I get a kick out of their use of naval terminology and rank. But the one problem that I have, along with most it would seem, is that it just suddenly ends with no resolution to the story. I would assume that there is a continuation coming, but when?"
5,Outstanding space action,"Anyone who has an interest in good old fashioned rip-roaring space battles, who ever loved a story of a war between good and evil, who ever stared with fascination at movies of space aliens battling brave human spaceships will *love* this book. It's almost non-stop action, but intelligently told, with incredible space battles on an epic scale for enormous stakes. The aliens are mysterious and unfathomable, and relentless, and you know from the start (as one of the characters says) it will be a battle to the death between them and humanity and its allies."
5,Great treats for your Dog,"My Danes love these treats. I break them up and sprinkle them over their dog food, and they always finish their food. These are the best liver treats I've found."
1,Much ado about nothing.,Fortunately this book was a gift because I would have been very perturbed had I spent my own money for it. Character development is very good but you constantly are waiting for things to happen to the characters that will get a rise out of your emotions. I just found it to be a boring book with a nonsensical ending.
5,"It works, and it's Healthy","My wife came to me and asked me to help her get in shape. Being a workout fanatic most of my life, helping her with the exercise part was easy. But the eating part was tougher. I eat healthy but don't have any set receipes or methodology; so I bought Denise's book and followed it religously for the first three to four weeks, doing all the shopping, cooking etc. She lost more than 12 lbs, looks wonderful and really has liked the food. We still use the book has a guide but mix in receipes from other sources like Cooking Light magazine etc., but we maintain Denise's daily intake of calories (about 1500) and fat -- about 25 percent -- for my wife. Denise is so upbeat, sensible and fun to read and watch. Besides being beautiful, she is full of common sense about eating and exercise. If you want sensible, good food -- not ""diet"" food, buy this book and follow it. It works. Thanks, Denise. You're the best."
2,Can you say Basic?,"If you don't know the benefits of a 401K, or don't understand the concept of compounding, then this is the book for you! Otherwise, this book presents ""Investing 000.01"" -- a very, very basic, and to me, disappointing and repetitious introduction to purchasing stocks. Even then, it talks about great stocks like Lucent, but does warn that stock prices may fluctuate (dive?) over time. I give it 2 stars for being a good intro for Jr. High students."
3,"Some Music is Odd, but Lots of Music for the Money","10 CDs of a variety of mellow, meditation, etc. music. Some of it is odd, so be sure to use a player that allows you to skip tracks conveniently. Not bad for a couple of bucks."
5,Full of Fun,"After reading some of the reviews for this book I am inclined to ask if they got it. This series has never been about hardcore mystery so much as mystery-lite with tons of characterization. I highly recommend that you not start out with this book. Go to ""Crocodile on the Sandbank.""That being said, I adored this book! It was so sun to see Ramses taking matters into his own hands. As usual, there was much to learn about Egyptology, and the speech Ramses gives to David describing Emerson's feelings for Amelia (and his for Nefret) were worth the price of admission!!"
2,Amelia Peabody - Mystery solver???,"This was my first and probably last Amelia Peabody mystery I shall read. Peabody is a nosy, verbose, upper class English Egyptologist famous for solving mysteries. I found the writing to be somewhat tedious and long winded. You'll have to suffer until page 125 for any sort of action to begin. I think only the true history lover can appreciate this novel, for most of the characters are either named after Egyptian gods or pharaohs. If this is the best novel Peters has to offer I dread to think of what her others may be like. This is a fairly quick read, really only a skim if there is absolutely nothing else at home on offer. I would reccomend other authors such as Christian Jacq, PC Doherty and Michael Asher who execute beautifully the wonders of Egypt."
1,Seeing a Large Cat,"I finally finished this tedious and unimaginative ""book."" If there were a possibility to rate this lower, I would. Amelia Peabody is a nosy, bumbling, stuck up character. I do not like the way she thought, talked, or acted. She did not solve any mystery. She was so caught up in her own interpretation of good and evil that she managed to put her family in harms way...nearly getting them killed in the process. However, I did like the new cat. I do not recommend this to anyone unless they are as shallow and self absorbed as Amelia Peabody."
4,Cute DVD,"I like the Christmas video, its a classic. The others, are so so productions. This DVD is well made, no issues."
3,will vintons claymation christmas plus halloween and easter celebrations,"the christmas one was great as i remember watching it years ago on tv, the other two i dont remember that well ,but i say they were fair, if your going to buy it, get it for the christmas one it was well worth it"
1,Skipping cd,"My daughter needed this CD for the Spring Program at her school. She teaches kindergarten and had to use a Disney song. It was hard enough to teach kindergartners to hula to Hawaiian Roller Coaster Ride, but to add to the problem, the CD skips!"
5,Great book - very eye-opening!,"I don't normally write reviews, but this book was great. I was skeptical and figured it would just list a bunch of suggestions that aren't practical in the real world, but I was wrong. Some of the material was very eye-opening, especially the topics that deal with looking at yourself to see how you may be contributing to the problem. Highly recommended!"
3,Offers useful truths,"This book taught me a few things and gently reminded me of a few others. I had hoped that reading this book would make me better able to navigate difficult conversations. Instead, I found myself merely able to regain my composure faster *after* a difficult conversation. This benefit is valuable, but is not what I sought."
3,Workplace communication.,This book really tries to teach how to have conversations with coworkers. It is great for managers or business owners to read and there are new strategies that can be used.
4,School Book,"I had to get this book for an interpersonal communications class in college. Not bad for something I was forced to read, and is applicable in every day life (unlike those stupid math books)."
3,cute but not the best quality,"This pillow case is very cute, my daughter loves it, but it definately isn't the best quality fabric, kind of scratchy and the print is not that great either, but for the price and to have one more incentive to stay in her big girl bed, it's worth the money."
1,"Anti-Intellectual Propoganda, Plain and Simple","Like ""Expelled"", but with worse editing and lacking the charm of Ben Stein whining about the poor, repressed Christian conservatives."
5,Twisted Metal III a dud? I think so.,"First of all, I do not think they should have went with a new company (989 Studios) even though 989 Studios have turned out some nice games. I do not think this is one of them. The 'real life' controls do not allow for accurate turning, and sluggish turning all around for most of the cars. Also, the levels; are look kind of bad. They (989 Studios) could have made this game BETTER THEN WHAT THEY MADE IT, AND I'M DISSAPOINTED."
3,Decent,This game was alright but definately had more flaws. The other TM's are way better than this one. But this one wasnt that bad it was good
4,"Great game, fun and entertaining, average replay value.","It's got fairly good graphics, good speed of game play and a good amount of variety of characthers. I've had the game about 5 months or so (might be less, can't remember when it was bought) and i still play it atleast once every couple of days. The difficulty isn't to bad. It's easy enough for the new players but adjustable to the really experienced players."
2,Buy Twisted Metal 2 instead,"Twisted Metal 3 is slightly faster than 2. There are a few new weapons. Otherwise, 989 Studios did a fine job of knocking the Twisted Metal franchise down a few notches. The level design is quite poor. The worlds in Twisted Metal 2 were clever and downright fun. Those in 3 are simply boring.At half the price, I highly recommend Twisted Metal 2 instead."
2,Worst of the TM series,"TM3 is nothing like the first two of the Twisted Metal series and it's not nearly as good either. The only improvement from the first 2 TM games are the graphics. The sound is about the same and everything else about it just sucks. The control ruins the rest of the game. Just about everytime you even get nudged by another vehicle or fall off a cliff, you end up upside down and that's what I really didn't like about TM3. When you get turned upside down, it slows you down and it gets frustrating. The control is not good at all when you compare it to TM2. You can't turn on a dime no more. The control is so messed up it ruins just about all of the fun factor and replay value.The only thing good about TM3 is the improved graphics. The levels are laid out pretty good and there's not as many pixels anymore, but like I said the control ruins the whole game. This is the worst of the Twisted Metal series. Twisted Metal 2 is still the best and Twisted Metal 4 is the second best."
5,It's the best,Hey if u dont buy it then u should. I got it and I play it all the time it is so nice u would like it to. See ya Jimmy.I beat u will like it.I got it 5 months ago.I still play it.
1,What is this?,"Twisted Metal 3 is overrated - because it's not normally considered the worst Playstation game. I can't believe how unfun this game is. The control is laughable. The gameplay is incredibly boring. The music is Rob Zombie, which is bad enough before you hear it 5,000 times in a row. The game also adds almost nothing new. Don't even rent this one."
5,They just messed up with the 3rd Twisted Metal,"989 Studios has made a bad mistake of making Twisted Metal 3. First of all, it's the same damn thing! Second, the controls suck! It's too sensitive and does not respond accurately. Other than that, the graphics are really awesome and the FMV sequences are great! 989 has put a lot of effort on this game, but not enough cars and tracks."
1,Twisted Metal 3,"Of the four Twisted Metal games, number 3 has the least amount of longterm enjoyment. The levels are small and the game is relatively easy. After beating the game with all the characters (which took about a month), I have no desire to ever play it again. Definitely rent but don't buy."
4,Good Game! Bad Game Physics.,"This game is a classic. I remember back in '99 buying this brand new off the shelf at Toys R Us. It was cool back then, but now that I see it, the gameplay physics is it's only biggest demise.You bounce and flop around all over the place many times while in a fire fight and it sure takes some patience not to slam you controller into your game console because of it.Twisted Metal 4 has much tighter control and is an improvement over TM 3.Twisted Metal 3 has better machine guns than 4 I think."
2,Looks Aren't Everything,The clock looks good but it's constructed of cheap plastic and the movement is an equally cheap battery powered unit not electric as you would assume from looking at it. Maybe that's why there is no detailed description of this clock on the web site so you don't really know what you're getting.
1,returned mine,"I was so disappointed with mine, I returned it to the store. I knew I didn't want to mess with batteries, so used it with the adapter right from the start, however, I found the amount of light totally inadequate. Unlike the reviewer of December 17th, I didn't want to compromise and risk damaging my eyesight by using it. I also found that it was too heavy to use in paperbacks, and not strong enough to light the entire page of a hardcover."
2,Disappointing,"I have bought two of these lights, and both were disappointments. In one of them the light bulb burnt out or broke within the first week, and in the other the light intensity kept flickering from bright to very dim; in both cases the light bobbed and shook far too much for a relaxed and effortless reading experience. What with one or another of these very annoying distractions, I've never managed to make my way through even one chapter using this method. A cute design and a lovely idea, but a poor product."
2,An over-priced gadget that sucks the life out of batteries.,"As my search for a well designed book light continues, this one was my third. Quickly I found out how fast it sucks the life out of my ""energized"" batteries. Additionally, one small movement in bed and you have to grab the light so it will stop bouncing. My search continues."
2,Could have done better,Nice light except light flickers in intensity and has no clip to hold it in place (easily falls out of book).
2,"OK, for a non-expensive and cheap toy","I suppose I expected something just a little more substantial. Held together by string, and with stones so small that I'm sure I'll be losing them quickly, this toy may be just as described (I honestly don't remember the exact description) but it's less than I expected."
3,"Very over priced, but good quality","I personally think this item is very over priced. I have found a local green grocer that sells the same size package for almost 1/2 the cost of this product.Other than cost, this was a very decent product. Will buy again, but from a cheaper source."
2,Could Not Get Into It,"I did not make it very far into this novel without giving up. I could not get into the psycho killer priest character, and he seemed to be driving the plot. Also the repeated murders of solitary women walking around the city at night did not make me want to keep reading."
4,"Very good, but could've been better...","This is the first of Robert's books that I've read . I liked the characters and the plot was suspensefull but I felt that the characters relationship could've been done better. I didn't like the ending much either, I was expecting more of a ""WOW!"" feeling after finishing the book but I felt more of a ""Eh, good book"" feeling. I recommend it but there were certain slow chapters that I thought could've been left out all together. Overall though...it was pretty good."
2,Not fast paced or intriguing enough,"I didn't find that this book had enough intrigue and suspense to keep me interested. I found the relationship between Tess and Ben to be a little too important in the book. It was more prevalent than the story line. What was that again? Oh Yeah.... a man is murdering women and they've dubbed him ""the priest"". Well, I would've liked that story line developed a little more than the romance. If you want to read this for suspense, don't bother."
2,Yuck!!,"The words seem to flow into a living thing, and the idea of this Sacred Sin is intriguing. Unfortunately, though, I couldn't believe in the string of events that transpired to put so many unlikely characters together, and I definitely couldn't believe in characters who constantly said they couldn't believe themselves or what they had just done, and what annoyed me the most was the characters were so ultra cool or ultra stupid or ultra rude or worst of all ultra heroic; nobody was normal. (Or Real!)"
4,Gift for Aunt's school class,Aunt is a teacher for gifted students. I bought this for her and her class because Tesla always fascinated me. Great learning tool that kids won't soon get bored with.
1,soundtrack ruins this disc,"Based on prior reviews I was looking forward to seeing this documentary. But after 5 minutes of watching, I turned it off. Why? The music portion of the soundtrack is way too loud drowning out the dialogue. Perhaps this is (was) a great documentary. I'll never know since I'm not about to spend 90 minutes straining to hear what is being said."
3,Shocking,"THe thing i was most shocked about was the fact that in this entire soundtrack, there was not songs by the star, Mandy Moore. In her small role in the Princess Diaries, she had a song on the soundtrack. In her last movie, Mandy had 4 songs. But overall, the songs was ok, songs from john mayher, and etc. weren't all that bad but still. ITs a movie with Mandy Moore, at least they could put in a song off of her upcoming album, ""coverage."" But thats my opinion.GO MANDY!"
4,How to Deal soundtrack review,I think that this movie is the perfect teen love story of the summer. The music fits in perfectly within the plot of the movie. It is a great soundtrack for this summer.
5,fantastic read,"Havent met a kid who didnt love this book and series. Inspire your kids to read or if you are a kid, inspire your parents to get you this series.This book is captivating, challenging (try to figure out what's up before the ending) and have fun sharing this book with friends!!!"
2,"A good idea, but...","Lacking. Many of the math-related questions are old and/or plain easy. Some of the story-type questions are old, some are reasonable, many are inadequate in their answers or they are absurd. (For example: in one, a king tries to commit suicide by poison but, though he takes enough to kill a person, he does not die. The answer? Many members of royalty built up an immunity to poisons by taking small doses over a period of time (that part's ok) - but no one would come up with that because if he'd built up an immunity, why would he try to kill himself that way? The answer does say 'who knows' why he would do this, but that's a ridiculous to have someone try to come up with because it makes no sense). My friends and I love challenging questions, but we found this game more stupid than fun."
2,MindTrap,"As a person who plays a lot of trivia games and enjoys puzzles I was disappointed in Mindtrap. The questions seemed to be intentionally misleading and you would be ""surprised"" by the answer which contained information not given in the question. The game usually resulted in a lot of frustration."
4,Returning to meaningful lyrics...,"A new cd is out, how is he? Let's find out... The songs really turn us back to the songs we love from Depeche Mode, meaningful lyrics, with the depth in them which all can identify and learn from...a cd which's like a little journey in time, hearing the songs reminds us of Depeche Mode, of life, so why 4/5? It's still not Depeche Mode..."
4,"Good, but not the best.","I just started ordering the Inuyasha series not too long ago because I heard that it was a good show. After ordering the first seven dvds, I had to wait a whole month before this one came out. When it did I was a little disappointed with the episodes. They still are entertaining, but the first two episodes on the disk are just boring. I guess, though, that all series have their downsides. This dvd is still a great dvd."
4,A classic instrumental album,"This is a great record. Not an all time best, but it is a solid classic. If you're into instrumental and experimental such as ""Explosions in the sky"" ""neu"" then this one is for you. This one is not as loud and as experimental as the ones mentioned, but it's got some greatness."
1,Pathetic,The tray is beyond pathetic. Do not buy this. It's criminal that is proudly labelled as DELUXE. A waste of money. An embarrassment. A cheat.
5,Rickman Is a Master of Suspense,I am a tremendous fan of the Merrily Watkins series. Rickman is a master at combining elements of mystery and suspense with horror and the supernatural. He is also simply a great story teller.
5,Phil Rickman Is In A Class All Of His Own!!!,"In this book the reader is once again introduced to the Reverend Merrily Watkins .The ""Cure Of Souls"" refers to an Excorcism which the Reverend is qualified but hesitant to do. This is a wonderful offering by the Master Of The Supernatural and unlike Stephen King and his contemporaries Mr. Rickman does not bludgeon his readers with scenes of Graphic Violence but instead makes the reader wary of shadows and things that go bump in the night. 5 stars for this most excellent book."
4,Little Red Corvette,"Nice decorative cologne set at a good price. The cologne itself is ok, nothing special but not bad. The corvette bottle is cool, and they have made these in several colors, so they are sort of collectable."
4,Lives of Secrecy,This excellent book by Ted Gup is a great testament to those who have gave their lives for their country but their contributions could not be fully acknowledged.Those in our intelligence community know that if they die while executing their jobs then there is a good chance that their lives and their missions may never be fully disclosed by the government.Gup does extensive research in this book and uncovers information that the CIA would probably not want people to find out. He writes this book so the families of the dead will finally know what their loved ones died for.I reccommend this book to anyone with strong interest in intelligence and covert operations. Definitely one for your espionage literary collection.
3,Facts checked out?,"Although I enjoyed this book, I have to admit that after page 351 when Mr. Gup wrote that Agent Freedman retired on February 31 (???),1990 I wondered how many other facts were not checked out before printing. An error such as this in a non-fiction book is a big disappointment."
1,Steer Clear,"Warning: Steer clear of the Reebok Incline Trainer. Although I enjoy using it once I get it working... it was on the fritz after only a few days. I can't get the incline function to work, nor can I use the incline workout program. Could it be a simple problem? Who would know! I cannot get an email response from the company and their phone hours are the same as my work hours. ICON is the company who actually makes this product, and they also make PROFORM, Nordic Track, and Horizon. Because of the poor customer service, I would caution before purchasing these other treadmill labels. If you decide to buy a Reebok X5, prepare yourself to unload and assemble a real bear. This isn't necessarily a critisizm, just be aware that it is too heavy and cumbersome for one person to manage. (You'll also need a dolly.) On the bright side, at least the treadmill malfunctioned early enough for me to return without a hitch."
5,Getting Ripped,"Read it years ago, Did'nt realize how informated it really was! One of the best publications on health and workout routines."
2,"Lots of bronzer=good, but smells weird","I ordered this because I was running low on my current tanning lotion which I love and it smells like skittles, so I read the reviews for this one that was supposed to smell like cherries or almonds and it does NOT smell like either. It just has a chemical odor and has so much bronzer in it that I really have to make sure to wipe my hands off. I will definitely be ordering some more of my original lotion to replace this nasty stuff."
5,My Favorite Tanning Bed Lotion,This is by far my favorite. The fragrance is very nice and even helps to mask that tanning bed odor your skin develops after tanning. It has a slight simmer that is nice if you are going out and the bronzer helps keep you motivated to keep tanning by giving your skin a darker appearance. The lotion isn't sticky and washes off easily. The bronzer doesn't stain clothing:)
1,Claudio Villa - Collection,"Poor chioce of songs and arrangements...Too ""Jazzy""...The albums are trying to be American instead of sticking to the proven Italian sound...Claudio should stick to what he does best and stay with singing in the Italian Romanza form."
4,Saving Shiloh,This book is about a boy whos name is Marty. Some bad things have been happening like murders and roberies and everyone is blaming it on Judd. Judd isn't the nicest man but Marty thinks he is innocent of the crimes. I would recommend this book to animal lovers and people who love exciting books. Jacob R.
5,Shiloh,"I liked the book a lot. I have a certain kind of taste if it dose'nt hold my attencion for more than 5 minets it's boring, but Shoiloh was great! Marty lives with his Mom,Dad, and his 2 sisters.Marty want a dog, but his Mom says they can't afourd one.Marty finds a dog by the Shiloh Bridge."
3,Good book for young kids,"This book is part of a series by the same author about the little dog Shiloh. I recommend getting the set if you have a kid who does a lot of reading. There's just enough drama about things happening to the boy or the dog to be exciting, but it's all very innocent and no real violence. Just a mean man who kicks dogs and yells at them. Don't worry - Shiloh comes out OK."
4,IDEAL!,"Thank God for dEUS. Just as I thought 1999 was going to pass without a really great rock album.. There's not much to say except that after only a couple of listens 'Instant Street' became one of my favourite songs ever. It's good to see a band who aren't afraid to experiment a little - and it's not just that they use a violin; it's the whole approach. So, a quiet song becoming progressively louder IS a tad formulaic, but dEUS take a song which gets progressively louder, come close to destroying it completely, before turning it into something else entirely - something sublime."
3,Potting Table,I was so excited when I saw this potting bench and with free shipping it was a great deal. My husband called me to tell me it had arrived and he would put it together. Well when I went outside to see the table I was disappointed because the potting bench was very different from the photo. I called customer service and they apologized and offered to send me another one. Again the wrong bench arrived. So I just kept the one they sent me originally. I like the bench I have but its definitely not the I ordered.
5,"Excellent speaker cable, very sturdy, exc quality","This speaker wire is the best I have bought. The sound is just fine, I hear no degradation or artifacts or anything that would result from a poor connection. The gauge, 14, is perfect for my setup, which includes seven speakers, and I do have two floor standing speakers; I use bare wire into my speaker outlets on each speaker and in the receiver. The outer jacket is white and sturdy and the inner wires are in red and black conductor jackets, very nice for connecting, to connect these properly to each source/speaker. I was able to use a standard wire cutting tool similar to a set of pliers but a larger tool or specific speaker wire cable tool would have helped. The spool was shipped promptly and in a sturdy box. I have ordered another spool of this same speaker cable, from this vendor for my speakers which currently have very small gauge cables. Thank you. Very pleased."
1,Beware bait and switch,"I ordered JSC wire made in the USA, rated CL3. What I got was Monoprice wire made in China, rated CL2. Returning for refund. This was very upsetting, and delayed my installation project. Given how many reviews of wire find that it is smaller gauge than advertised and not pure copper wire, I'm not willing to take a chance that the Monoprice wire is actually 14 gauge and pure copper."
3,Good Speaker wire but...,I was disappointed with the wire casing.. Most of my wire throughout my theater is like a pliable satellite cable with heavy gauge wire this just seemed cheap... but sound quality was fine.. for that I give it 3 stars and move that wire to the garage radio...lol
4,very good for measuring small amounts,"very good for measuring small amounts ,didnt know that they were made quite that small but they are very h elpful thank you for making theseutensils"
5,Class Reunion Murder,"Our family used this game to celebrate my daughter in laws 30th birthday. I set a side table to look like a malt shop and everyone really dressed to their part. The first ten minutes we just laughed at everyone's costumes. We made 1950's type food, meatloaf, macaroni and cheese and made home made ice cream. It was a bit of work and preparation but it was really a fun night and everyone really stayed in character trying to solve the mystery.You have to have a week or two ahead lead time to send out invites and give people time to gather their props for their costumes. We had lots of laughs and it was really a fun evening. We will do this again."
1,The false prophet,"Consider this comparison:The Maitreya parallels the false prophet as described by St. John in the Revelation of the Holy Bible with surprising precision. Don't be deceived! If you liked this book, then in the interest of being open-minded, read the book of the Revelation and compare for yourself. Keep in mind that the Revelation was written before the concept of the ""Maitreya Christ"" was even conceived."
1,Had no effect,"From the review distribution, it looks like it alleviates one of the primary causes of spraying. Sadly, my cat apparently sprays for the other reason :(. The spray had no effect for me."
1,Loudmouth Loser,"Simply put, O'Reilly is just a loud mouthed loser with the same opinion as a bunch of other pissed off, middle-aged, white dudes with nothing better to do with their time than to complain, whine, and oversimplify problems, thinking that whoever yells the loudest is right."
2,"O'Reilly, O'Really?","Although Bill O'Reilly offers astute observations, he provides no clues as to how to remedy the problems he identifies. He is a bright man; at the same time his self-righteousness tends to dilute the effect of his analysis. The book is entertaining and easy to read, but his proposed solutions are not as simple to acheive as he suggests."
1,How Bill O'Reilly can afford his penthouse.,"This is the best book ever written, that is if you like a man who can not even take care of him self telling you how to live your life. If you read this book you will feel better about your self, because it shows you haw much smarter you are than one of Americas top journalists. However if you do not wish to spend money that will help pay for Big Bills penthouse, just read the comics in your news paper, I'm thinking it will be easier for you Bill O'Reilly fans to read too. Do not spend money on this."
1,"Another Compelling, Must-Ignore Book","Yet again Bill O'Reilly hits the mark with another compelling, must-ignore book. When you think about it (and let's not spin this) there are few contemporary writers more important to ignore than O'Reilly. The man, one must admit, is a giant in his own mind: he was the first to climb Mount Everest (or at least ""was there""); fought heroically in the Civil War (""was there,"" at least, for most of that war's seminal battles); spearheaded the allied attack (and victory) against the Germans in WWII (or at least ""was there""): marched with Martin Luther King and, more impressively, wrote most of Dr. King's greatest speeches; and presently holds ""the true"" world records in the mile, 100 meters and 400 meter hurdles. Regarding the present book, it clearly reflects a Nietzchean consummation of the man's towering grandiosity. And by the way, O'Reilly knew Nietzche, and in fact, ""taught the guy most of what he knew."""
5,an Outstanding work of non-fiction,"A wonderful change of pace and follow up to his first book, ""Those Who Trespass"""
5,O'Reilly Factor,Finally someone who will go against mainstream soceity and popular opinion to tell it like it really is. His no spin approach has attracked a loyal following of those who agree and disagree with his views. I would recommend this book to anyone looking for a non-bias opinion on politics and life. I am thinking of buying a copy for our departing president and his newly elected wife. I'm sure they would enjoy it.
4,O'Reilly has common sense.,"The Fox News Channel is probably the most important information gathering tool to come along since Gutenbergs printing press. Finally the liberal media is being exposed for what it is, a biased self interested behemoth selling out to socialiast drifting government. Bravo Fox for being our David to their Goliath. From this new media vigilante comes Bill O'Reilly. On some issues he seems out of place, almost socialistic ,but for the most part he speaks with a direct common sense approach. O'Reilly seems to be a bit too self absorbed in this book, but through the recollections of his life you discover a personality who has been able to steer clear of dangerous fads and created an infectious display of highbred ethics. This is a very quick and easy read. I would recommend this book to anyone, especially adolescents for it is packed with down to earth good advise for leading a heathful and productive life."
5,Good Stuff,"This was very easy reading and different. It was refreshing to read well thought out ideas. Some of them may be ""old fashioned"" (but not necessarily liberal or conservative), but most of it is right on target."
1,lame,"Typical ""I want less government, unless it's for my right-wing causes"" mentality. Only for the sheep of the world."
4,OK...So Bill is crotchety,"What an excellent compliment to his TV show. If you love 'The Factor', you will appreciate this book too. Bill keeps the book light enough for children to read, and also gives some folks their first lesson on why Jesse Jackson is the most corrupt politician in America."
2,Necessary idiocy,"a guaranteed low-IQ generator that's sure to keep thousands of conservatives (and I mean that word in the worst possible sense) perpetually grovelling in their paranoias about the evil ""liberal press"" and other useless hallucinations. Can America be dumbed down anymore? Sure.At least Bill O'Reilly is expert on the ""Completely ridiculous"" in our society - for he earnestly churned out its news night after night for years on tabloid tv. The fact that people take this stuff (Limbaugh-inspired) seriously, assures me that true libertarians shall always be listened to.It's almost as if the universe from time to time spawns a character like O'Reilly to create a necessary backlash and wake up intelligent mindsets to the horrifying possibilities for powerful - yet demented - voices in the media.Keep up the ridiculous work, Bill. We apparently need it."
1,"19 chapters of junk, 1 chapter of gratitude","19 chapters of junk, 1 chapter of gratitude. he complains throughout the book. in the final chapter, he tells you who impresses him."
1,More Bill O Liely,"Okay Bill,The Kay report has been released: No WMD's.The Whitehouse now admits that there were none.Tenet says that there never were any WMD's. Intelligence reports were (variously) misread, not read, misquoted, misunderstood. All of which are massive failures or deceptions by the administration.Black and white.Yet you still haven't apologized. The clock is ticking Bill.Your book(s) suck and are pretty much all fiction.In the name of truth in advertising you should really change the name of your show to ""The O'Liely Factor - Spin Zone""."
4,uplifting,"Generosity, patience, honesty, and tolerance ( but not of evil). Truly American values. I'm glad I read this book, as I did find it uplifting. The values Mr. O'Reilly espouses are to be strived for, especially if America is to remain the great country it is, now and in the past. Thank you Mr. O'Oreilly for writing this book, and the O'Reilly Factor for Kids which I also found to be an excellent read and an important one for a new generation of Americans."
1,Completely Ridiculous,"Bill proving once again that he does not know the difference between good and bad, and his views are completely ridiculous. I can't believe I wasted my time reading this book. I feel as if my brain is going to need time to recover from a massive loss of intelligence after reading this book."
3,A solid offering from the best interviewer on TV,"The O'Reilly Factor is my favorite show. Not because I always agree with Bill, but because he asks the toughest questions on television. After seeing Jesse Ventura joke his way around the American airwaves I was surprised at how sober he was on the Factor.The book is set up much like the show, in that it is mostly a social critique with built-in footnotes and opinions. O'Reilly backs up much of the material with evidence to support his opinions. You couldn't call anyone with such outspoken opinions a moderate, but his opinions are all over the spectrum. He's anti-death penalty and anti-abortion. He supports a tax-cut and more government regulations for the airlines.If you can't get the show, you'll find yourself calling your local cable company after reading this book. If you watch the show, this book will answer many questions not covered on the air. This is a good choice for anyone who enjoys current issues and politics with a fresh perspective."
2,Weak,"Right up front, I have to admit that I love the O'Reilly Factor TV show on FOX. I think Bill O'Reilly has one of the best news talk shows on the air. Based on my enthusiasm for his show, I rushed right out to buy his book.I was hoping to gleen some brilliant insights directly from O'Reilly himself. Unfortunately, his book offers few insights and little substance. There are no profound revelations to be found here. Reading the book is just like listening to one of your friends spout his opinion on a variety of subjects.If you like Bill O'Reilly, I'd stick with his TV show and skip his book."
1,SCREWPULL PRODUCT MAY BREAK A BOTTLE AT THE NECK,"My Screwpull caused a wine bottle to break at the neck. If the device is not perfectly aligned with the bottle, it may place too much pressure on the glass bottle. The break happened while pulling the handle up to remove the cork. It left a gagged neck which may have been dangerous.May be wise to search for another model."
1,What?,"Perhaps it is just me, but the idea of paying $150 for a corkscrew seems are big insane. Consider the fact that the average bottle average wine costs no more that $35.00, why would anyone spend $150 on a bottle opener? I don't know."
3,Lasted 5 years then broken... disappointed!,"We loved this unit when it worked. We bought one of these about 5 years ago, and loved it so much that we gave at least 5 out to friends for Weddings. Unfortunately after about 4 years the screwpull stopped pulling the corks out all together. We sent it back for repair, but the one we got back has slowly fallen into the same ugly pattern. I could send it back again, but one of the things you expect from spending [price] for a cork screw is that you shouldn't have to repeatedly send it back. We loved this unit when it worked, but now we are on to trying a different model; OXO Goodgrips CorkPull... Now thats a savings; if this thing breaks I wont think twice about throwing it out and buying a new one, something I wont do with a [price] unit. Stay tuned for my long term review of the OXO product."
2,Cork Problem,"As a new item, the Screwpull was very good, but after a year of use, one problem keeps happening. After the cork is removed from the bottle, it doesn't want to come off of the screwpull. When trying to grip the cork by the handles, it is always too small and becomes a chore to take off. I have to use something around the cork to make up the room to squeeze it tight."
2,"very flawed collection, try ""Singles""","The ""Best Of The Smiths"" volumes 1 & 2 are disappointing and should not be bought. They are not a good introduction to the music of the Smiths or a good overview of their career; the 'Best Of' albums leave out many of their seminal songs and contain bizarre choices. The CD entitled ""Singles"", which simply has all 18 of the Smiths' singles, is far better than the 'Best Of' CDs as far as showing what the Smiths were all about, or giving you much of their best material in one source. ""Singles"" works very well as an album- it doesn't have the disjointed feel of many ""greatest hits"" collections, probably because the Smiths released all of their material in a period of only a couple years. That ""Singles"" is superior to ""Best Of The Smiths"" is not only my opinion, but the opinion of the majority of Smiths fans."
5,Wow...,"When I first picked this book up, I was pretty young..about 8 or so..And this book scared me..It made me see exactly where we could still be headed and how things still may turn out.."
4,The ultimate guide to behavior manipulation,"This book is a must for anyone who is an aspiring guru . . . or those who want to know what happened to them when they were under the spell of a charismatic leader.This book does a remarkable job of clearly and scientifically explaining what happens in that moment that they term snapping, that moment where you feel a real transformation take place, something you can't explain but feel and experience.That snapping experience is common to EST graduates, Charasmatic Christians, Evangelicals, Landmark and Landspring grads and followers of cults.This book is frightening because you'll understand exactly how the moment is created and you'll be able to recreate it.If you are a speaker or trainer, this book is a must read. But the application must be ethical and appropriate if you intend to use the techniques with your audience.Dave LakhaniAuthor of: Persuasion: The Art of Getting What You WantPower of An Hour: Business and Life Mastery in One Hour A Week"
3,Too exacting,"I LOVE the Tomb Raider series, and while I found the locations, music, and puzzles greatly improved in TRIII, I was sorely disappointed by the difficulty of play. This game expects movements to be absolutely EXACT, which means you can play a particular jump about fifteen times without getting it just right, and thus dying or having to repeat a long series of actions. There is one puzzle which requires timing that is, and I mean this, virtually impossible to do. Hoard your save game gems for this kind of use."
2,Stick with TR1 & TR2,"Please be warned: this game is long and arduous. If you love to spend long hours searching through trees for some hidden switch with very poor lighting then this game is a good investment. The new weapons, improved graphics, and ""duck & crawl"" move are a plus. My advice is to stick with the first two and possibly get the fourth which is more in the lines of the first: actual ""tomb raiding"". All in all, not a pleasant experience."
1,Just Say NO!,I adore the TR games & I have completed them all except for this one. I have tried to get into it and have started it on 3 separate occasions. I just do not find it fun. The most frustrating aspect is the save crystals. This game is unreasonably hard in some sections yet you are afraid to save and waste a save crystal in case you need it more later on. I don't feel the crystals add to the challenge of the game. They just make the game annoying.Don't waste your time and money. Just enjoy the rest of the TR series and pretend this one didn't happen.
5,"Exiting game, new concept of choose your own path to finish","I like the new concept of being able to play the middle three levels in any order you want. This lets the user feel like they have more control over the destiny of the game. You still have to achieve certain goals, but it adds to the excitement. London was simply amazing with Lara in her black leather body suit, rain pouring down around her on the scaffolds.....very entertaining and exciting. I have all four of the series, still have not finished this one, but I'm looking forward to how it all turns out in the end."
4,Truly Repugnant!,"The objective of this game is to plunder Third World art treasures while brutally wiping out as much endangered wildlife and indigenous people as possible. It's a truly repugnant scenario and I would not let a young person anywhere near this game.On the other hand, if you don't necessarily look to computer games for political vision and leadership, you may want to play it anyway. The game is incredibly large with plenty of beautiful and varied scenery to explore, but most players will probably find the gameplay very difficult indeed. I personally found the most enjoyable way to play was with a complete walkthrough solution plus the cheat codes to maximise all items and scores. The game is still a challenge even then!"
4,phlebotomy essentials,phlebotomy essentials i think is an excellent texbook for people trying to get in to the profession of phlebotomy.It covers all the essential topics needed to know.
5,Great bag for a great price,This is a great gig bag for people on the go and the price is the best you will fine for a Protec. The only con is that it does not have a place to put your music but it is worth every penny. It also shipped early as well.
4,Cool Game w/Fairly Realistic Graphics and Control,"Revenge is ""too sweeet"" as Nash would say. Revenge is fun to play with fairly realistic graphics and control. The best thing about it is there are many modes of play. I would recommend this game if you like wrestling and are into video games. Also the best wrestler you can select is probably Scott Hall."
5,Best WCW/nWo Yet,"THQ and Asmik make the jewel of WCW/nWo games yet. Graphically, this game surpasses WWF Warzone, but gameplay is simple and lacking. What fun is a wrestling game where a finsiher can be executed with using two or three buttons. The Battle Royal mode is great, except when you press ""Z"", and the computer takes over. The one player mode is enough to keep wrestling fans satisfied for a while. However get three of your friends together and have a Battle Royal--now you're talking! I wish THQ would have added a ""Create Player"", but it was cut. I wish that THQ would have compressed certain things on the cartridge, and then they may have been able to add some cinemas and theme music. Although I still don't understand the ""Spirit Meter"" . . . I guess it has some purpose. Overall, get it if you can understand why two sweaty guys like to throw each other around in a canvas ring :-)."
3,a pretty cool game,"they sacrificed the create a character mode but in its place are like oodles of wrestlers.this game was made during one of wrestlings hottest eras.probably still is.so the wcw had lots o cash to hire lots o wrasslers and thats why theres zillions of them up for grabs.theres the regular wcw guys,the nwo,luchadors,ravens flock,japanese superstars,losers youve never heard of before,and every other gang from that time.the only real problem is the game is very simple to beat.now im not normaly one to complain about easy video games but this game got beat literaly in under 4 hours after i bought it on every level.its better if youre getting this for a kid i guess."
5,The best wrestling game on the market.,When I played this game I just couldnt stop. The graphics are far more superior to any of the other games out right now. My hand goes out to Nintendo for making one of the best games again.
5,BEST WRESTLING GAME YET,"THIS GAME IS AWESOME! IT IS CLEARLY THE BEST WRESTLING GAME AVAILIBLE! WITH OVER 60 WRESTLERS, YOU WON'T GET BORED!!"
5,WCW/NWO REVENGE IS THE BEST WRESTLING GAME EVER!,"I have never seen anything like REVENGE before!IT'S JUST TOO SWEEEEAAT!There is so many wrestlers to choose from(sadly no RIC FLAIR),plenty of weapons,40 men battle royals,automatic saved memory! Warzone may have better graphics but, REVENGE has all the fun!!!"
3,A great classic ruined by a shoddy new design.,"I picked up this somewhat newly designed version at a thrift store recently. Battleship has long been a favorite game of mine but mine and my husband's enjoyment was spoiled quite a bit by the unnecessary new design. Why mess with a classic? They have replaced the very simple pegs with clumsy ill-fitting ones that fall out at the slightest bump. They have rounded the edges of the case, thereby eliminating the helpful score keeping holes at the top edge of the game that allows you and your opponent to keep track of who is ahead. I do not see the point of any of these 'updates'. Very annoying. If you can find an old version at a yard sale or on eBay I would recommend skipping this. My husband and I, both adults, had a difficult time with the new design. I can't imagine young children playing this without some frustration."
5,this is a great direct bury wire,this is a great direct bury wire. the cables are thick and the outer sourounding is thick and strong also. You can't go wrong with this. Depending on how much you need you may want to look at the 500' roll as (3) 100 foot lengths are the same price as the 500 footer. Just do not leav your self short and it is always a good idea to have a lttle extra coiled up if you plan to run it through pipe underground. This will provide some flexability if you need to move your speaker.
5,Excellent Direct Burial Wire,"I recently expanded my home sound system by adding two speakers to an outdoor arbor swing located about 50' from the rear of my home. As it turned out, I needed every inch of wire on the two rolls I purchased, but I couldn't be more pleased with the results. Outstanding quality at a price that made my project very affordable. Highly recommended."
4,Still a Good Game for Multiplayer,"Turok 2 does lack something in single player. It by no means is due to the lack of thought put into the game at all. It is very challenging yet has very little strategy to it. Also, there probably is little desire to kill dinosaurs for the viewer. Here is where other games like Goldeneye 007 (for N) shine. A real highlight of the game is multiplayer. It has great multiplayer action. It is hilarious to shoot someone in the butt with an arrow....and watch him run around all day long with an arrow still stuck in him. This game isn't the best you can buy, and it is by no means anywhere near the worst. The graphics are excellent in the game, especially with the assortment of weapons and explosions which do surpass Goldeneye 007. It is well worth it..."
3,Good graphics great game speed.,The biggest grip that I had was the controls. They just didn't feel right and I got killed more often then not just trying to walk or jump. Alltogether a decent game though.
3,This game is all about graphics,"This game is all about graphics sadly. The weapons are awesome too and multiplayer is fun, but single player is bad. I got lost on the first level, and every level after that. The multiplayer characters are really cool though, and it can be fun. I would rent it first."
4,A fun chalenging game,"Turok 2 is a game that is challenging and fun. If you're a person that likes games that you can beat after two days, Turok is not for you. turok 2 is hard, it takes determination and patience. I was dissapointed about it to but when I blew the head off of my first enemy, I had to get to the big boss which was hard. The controlls are bad, I admit that but once you play it for a few days, it's a cake walk. You might want to get a memory pak with a lot of pages because you can't win without it. It is also helpfull to have Prima's book which makes it a lot easier. there are codes but that defeats the pourpose ,they make it stupid."
3,"An interesting, if uneven ,look at a celebrity life.","This book was a good read, but I would have enjoyed more insight into her view of the people in her life. I never felt at all clear about the attraction to Mr. Sinatra, or his for her. I didn't gain any insights into Dali, or many of th e other people in her life. A clear picture of her father emerges, and a few others. In my opinion, the book is worth reading for the account of her life with manical egotist Allen, and the resulting judge's ruling regarding custody of the Farrow children in itself, but Farrow truly did have an interesting life before the infamous break-up. I feel as though I can't ever sit through an Allen movie again without this horrific view into the man's psyche interfering with any enjoyment. But Farrow emerges as a much more interesting person than Allen, and her struggles, blindnesses, and final triumph are quite absorbing at times."
3,good for people in charge of outhers,The book wasn't written so much for me but more for an office manager . I would recomend it to any one in charge of outhers though.
2,They made the treat too thin,"My cat prefers his daily vitamin more than ziwipeak treat. I can't understand why they made the treat into very thin square. They should have made it into a cube, so that cat can chew on it. My cat did take a few bites of the treat, but they kept falling off from his mouth due to the shape of this treat. He didn't go crazy over this treat like he does with other healthy treats I found elsewhere."
5,GeneinSD,This is my second Coleman expandable water carrier-recently purchased for use on a Colorado pack trip. The first was bought thirty years ago and is still in service. Great product-
5,The Bold Supermodel Janice Dickerson Tells it ALL,"Supermodel Janice Dickeerson has no problem informing the world about her life of ""perfliction."" She openly discusses her many plastic surgeries, drug addiction, and life in the world of being a supermodel. The beauty of this book is how Janice let's ALL women know, you will never really be perfect no matter how hard you try. She even let's us know how her 10 year old daughter wants to be like the perfect supermodel.She talks about several of her love affairs, the crazy and outlandish stunts she's pulled along the way. Janice offer some great beauty and life/living tips. This is a book every woman should have in her collection. I know I will always pick it up to re-read, re-read, and re-read!!!!! You will be shocked at some of the things you will find out on your quest through this tell tale."
1,"Self-centered, poorly written trash",Don't waste your time or money. Read something more enlightening...like the back of a cereal box!
1,Ms. Dickinson is OUT OF TOUCH with reality,"I'm a working photographer in the fashion industry, and after seeing this book, i'm embarassed to have Janice Dickinson say she is part of this world. Many, many, things she says is either untrue or so distorted that it is laughable. Janice has not worked as a model for 20 years, and when she did work she had a VERY bad reputation for being difficult. Please , do not use her advice. Try to get advice from working professionals in the business today. The book is full of half-truths, and can lead people down a nasty path. Just know that nice, polite, and professional people have long lasting careers in this industry. Her advice is to treat people badly, and they'll respect you..... not in this business. Janice is the ONLY person in this business who thinks she is ""the world's first supermodel""..."
5,The Best Flying Combat Simulator,"Rogue Squadron is an excellent game, and unsurpassed by anyother game involving flying and blowing stuff up. There are little stormtroopers, TIEs, AT-ATs, AT-PTs, and more to blow up. The artificial intelligence is NOT great, until the last level (excluding secret levels) where the fully robotic TIEs are purely evil, not to mention annoying. However, this is a great game, featuring all your favorite ships from Star Wars. There are three secret ships and levels. The three ships are the TIE interceptor (enter tiedup at the password screen), the Millenium Falcon (enter farmboy at the password screen), and the Naboo Starfighter (enter halifax? then !yngwie! at the password screen). The three levels are the Begger's Canyon Run (unlock all levels on Bronze), the Death Star Trench Run (unlock all levels on Silver), and the Battle of Hoth (Unlock all levels on Gold, which is insanely hard). Overall, an excellent game with a good price."
5,An incredible game! A must buy.,"This game has it all. Great graphics, sound that would even impress John Williams, and incredible gameplay. This game has tons of features. From the bios of your wingmen to the extra levels like the Trench Battle on the Death Star, Rogue Squadron will impress everyone. The game is greatly improved with the new expansion pak. A great gift for the holidays!"
5,One of the best star wars games on any platform.,"I love Star Wars. This game though, would be fun even if you didn't like Star Wars. The detail in the world is great. You can even see people walking around the villages while your dog fighting the ties. One major drawback, which is why this doesn't get 5 stars, is the relatively hard to complete missions. Some are just too frustrating and the wing men are of no help. There are some other minor flaws in the controls, but for overall experience, this has to rank up there with Golden Eye."
3,Booring Star Wars Game,"Okay, I normally love everything Lucas Arts puts out, but this...I really, honestly loathed this game! The gameplay was repetitive, hard, and booring. Basically, it is every vehicular battle from the trilogy, put on a game.While this had great potential, and awesome graphics, I cannot reccomend it."
3,Good Chick Lit,"I read the poor reviews for this book and almost didn't get it. I'm glad I did. It was pretty good chick lit. I kept in mind it was FICTION, and I thought the author did a good job with the plot of the commune, the wealthy grandmother, and the friends. Was it realistic? Who knows? I know of nobody who had experience in a commune, or whose entire family was lost. It might be a stretch for Mona to fall in love with Mike, but in real life stranger things have happened. I enjoyed the book."
5,good,Enjoyed reading this book. It was cute and enjoyable. The characters were interesting and overall the story was pretty good.
4,??? The Ugly Truth ???,"Cute story, reminded me of The Ugly Truth. Seriously, I wonder which came first. Someone might owe someone royalties. The stories are not identical but very, very close."
2,"Premise good, hard to read","Reinventing Mona started out alright - it had a great premise, and was funny, which is something I really enjoy while reading. However, every sentence was so overly-descriptive that I ended up deleting this title off of my Kindle before I was even a third of the way through it. Too much description makes a book hard to read, and I got tired of trying to decipher all of it to get to what the author was actually trying to say."
3,"Mona, Mona, Mona","First book I've read by Jennifer Coburn. The story started off well but then somewhere in the middle (?) it kinda took a ""wrong turn"" but ended OK. Sometimes too much useless information and sometimes not enough. Think I'm going to have to give the author another chance."
2,A waste of time,"What started out with potential turned into a total wasted read. Towards the end, there were too many non-important characters introduced and then everything ended abruptly. There was no real relationhip development between Mona and Mike and Adam was a complete loser. Not sure that I will read another book by this author after this awful book."
5,hilarious,"This book was a lot of fun with outrageous plot twists andhilarious scenarios.Who hasn't wondered what life would look like if we could engineerit so we could seem bigger and brighter than we really are? This is what30-year-old Mona Warren sets out to do as she sets her sites on Adam Zigler, her family accountant.She hires a string of actors, consultants and dancers to set the stage for her happily ever after. Instead of the Hollywood ending, Mona finds herself in a romantic comedy of errors, fumbling every step of the way. In the end, Mona gets far more than she bargained for. I got adelightfully funny and charmingstory about life, love and loss. Good fun chick-lit. Equally, if not as funny as Coburn's first book, The Wife of Reilly!"
5,Very entertaining,"I never heard of Early Edition. I was searching for somthing similar to Eli Stone and this popped up. You really get hooked on this series. Suspensfull, clean, no bad language or sex. A good story line. I just fell in love with Kyle Chandler. He is one of a kind. Just finished the last disc and cannot wait to watch the second season. If you like good clean entertainment, this is highly recommended."
4,Good for middle school,The book was for my 10 year old nephew. He said it was a good book and he didn't mind reading it.
3,A dissapointment,"I have several of Thalia's CDs in my collection, this one is a dissapointment. The issue isn't Thalia's ability to sing in English or attract English speaking audiences, the issue is the material. ""I Want You,"" with Fat Joe, was created for airplay on hip-hop radio stations. However, hip-hop is not Thalia's strength, nor need it be. It's too bad record execs assumed audiences are dumb, insisting that Thalia's debut for the English speaking world start with a silly hip-hop tune instead of demonstrating her Latin roots. Her ability to bring Latin flair to pop music is why her fans keep buying her music."
1,THALIA = NO TALENT,I HAVE NO IDEA WHY PEOPLE LOVE THALIA. THIS CROSSOVER ALBUM SHOULD HAVE NEVER BEEN AN IDEA. I THINK THALIA MADE A HORRIBLE LANDING INTO THE ENGLISH MARKET. HER SINGING IS HORRIBLE. SOME SONGS SOUND LIKE SONGS FROM 2 YEARS AGO. I DO NOT RECOMMEND WAISTING YOUR MONEY ON THIS CD. GO BUY TALENTED LATIN ARTIST'S CD. SUCH AS SELENA OR SHAKIRA. I BELIEVE THALIA IS CORNY AND FAKE.
1,THE EVIL DOINGS OF TOMMY MATOLA! THALIA HAS SOLD OUT!,"WOW! This album sucks! What was Thalia thinking!? I have been a fan of Thalia for many years so when I found out she was crossing over (even though she swore she never would... LIAR!) I was a little curious. For gods sake I have all her older albums like LOVE and MUNDO DE CRYSTAL! Thalia is known for her hot latin inspired pop music and flawless ballads. What this album is a ""ghetto-fied"" monstrosity! What a shame! Thalia needed to stay true to her roots and give the anglo community a taste of TRUE latin flavor. For example, her grammy nominated album ARRASANDO. THALIA IS A NOW A BIG J.LO WANNABE... AND TOMMY MATOLA (HER HUSBAND) IS PROBABLY TO BLAME. STICK TO WHAT YOU KNOW, THALIA."
1,Corny Big time,another Eye Candy Artist that just doesn't translate with making quality or good music.Yeah Her Husband Former Sony Music CEO TOmmy Mottola Pulled off the Career of His Ex Mariah Carey&also had a Big Hand in J-Lo's Career&Run but that Formula doesn't work here because Thalia is even a notch beneath J-Lo Vocally&that is truly dreadful to the ears.this Album seems like Mariah's 7 Year Old Left-overs in production&Overall Presentation.
1,POR FAVOR QUE PORQUERIA....,"THALIA NUNCA HA SIDO UNA BUENA CANTANTE Y SUS DISCOS SIEMPRE HAN SIDO MALOS, PERO ESTE ULTIMO HA LLEGADO MUY LEJOS. EL DISCO ES MALISIMO, LA MUSICA ES CORRIENTE Y LAS CANCIONES TONTAS. ME ARREPIENTO TOTALMENTE DE HABER MALGASTADO MI DINERO EN ESTA PORQUERIA."
2,Ouch,The color was nice but the product itself dried out lips and caused a faint burning sensation. I got this because it was supposed to be a dupe of NARS turkish delight.
3,Warped,"I bought this smoker for my husband as an anniversary gift since he loves to grill and smoke meats. My husband put it together immediatley and the cannister was warped so the lid doesn't fit right. He still cooked with it,but it takes food a little longer since the lid doesnt close right. I also wasn't happy with it not having a temperature gauge. Guess other than those two things it would be a good smoker."
4,Got A Better Price On This At Home Depot,I picked one up today at my local Home Depot for $59.90. Did not come with cover but I have seen these at Ace Hardware for $14.99. I had been using a Smokey Joe Electric Smoker but this model uses water pan which I prefer.
4,Nice Product,"I ordered this smoker for my husband. I was a little worried about the reviews that mentioned it was hard to assemble but I didn't have any problems at all. The smoker arrived undamaged with all its parts. It's solid and attractive. Best of all, it does a really good job of smoking meats (and even vegetables!). If I were to improve it I would make the access door in the side bigger so I could add liquid and charcoal more easily but it's not terrible by any means. We did purchase a digital thermometer because the gauge just shows readings of low, medium, and high and being new to smokers this didn't give us enough information. I think that what is key to smoking meats is to get the smoker going and just sit back, relax, and let it do its thing. I would recommend this product to anyone who wants a ""wet"" smoker!"
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"Received as a gift. Missing parts so I called customer service. No one answers. All done by recording. Sent request. Took forever to get an answer but finally received the part, 10 days later!!! Cooked the first time. Temperature never gets above 200 degrees and that is on a calm day with the outside temperature 78 degrees. Their customer service is AWFUL and the product is VERY DISSAPOINTING."
2,Shoddy workmanship,"Although I have previously owned a similar Brinkman Elcetric Smoker with a temp control dial and a thermometer, this new smoker appears to have been designed and built by people who have virtually no idea of the word craftsmanship. Besides having a missing part from the sealed plastic bag, I had to bend all three handles so I could line up the pre-drilled screw holes. I had to jerryrig a missing V clip--a support for the water pan. Because of all this, it took more than two hours to assemble. Shoddy workmanship, no temp gage, and no heat control make it a reach for me to even give this smoker two stars."
3,packaging was ripped and beaten,"I received the smoker and the box was ripped completely down the side, everything was still in the box, this was a Christmas gift. We opened the box and did not see anything missing. Gave it as a gift and when put together is was dented and out of round. I was now embarrassed, I am so sorry I did not send it back, but the box would not have made it."
2,Damaged,"The smoker is much larger than it appears on the advertisement so make sure you have room for it. Mine came with the shipping box in shreds and the product was dented and damaged; I returned it and as usual, Amazon was very efficient in handling the process immediately."
1,"still have not recieve my package yet, but they claim they send it? not sure what to do","i have not recieved my pacakge yet, but they claim they send it and it was delievered?not sure what to do?"
4,Awsome Game,"I got this game 2 years ago and I still like to play it. It is a really neat game and is fun for a long time, because there are so many ways to go. I like it when the horse jumps over the fence right after you rescue it. But I think it should be rated teen not everyone because it has some gore and blood. This is a a great game and I recommend it for new gamers."
2,not a rpg at all,"my first impression of this game was really frustrating, 'cause i was one of many gamers that i know to be fooled by that big expectation nintendo created about this game. I expected something huge, a really big rpg easily capable to beat ff7, but when i played i found out it was not even a rpg. I mean, there are no skills, no level ups, and you can control just that link guy. The graphics are not the best ones i've seen in the n64, not mentioning the poor storyline which is based in that old story -the bad guy picks the princess and you, the hero, have to solve the problem. Very poor game! if you want real rpgs you should try some playstation titles like xenogears, breath of fire 3, legend of legaia, star ocean: second story among others."
1,Boring.....,"After I heard All the good things about this game I convinced my friend to buy it (I didn't have any money). I have to say that this is the most boring game I have ever played.The whole ocarina thing has really no point at all. This is a very hard game to control. The horse that you win (Epona) is very hard to turn around coners. And when you are in the water, it is very hard to move slowly (ex. if someting is under you that you have to get)I would recomend not geting this game unless you want to sit through hours of text.Also, This is not an RPG!!! an rpg does not have the kind of fight sceens in this game."
5,HOLY MOLY BEST GAME IN NINTENDO SAYS NINTENDO POWER IVE BEATEN IT 43 TIMES,Like the headline says that ive beaten it 43 times and i am ADDICTED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Anyone who has ever played a video game thats zelda and they somewhat liked it will love this game i have spend days and days watching link slash bats and reflecting ganondorfs blasts and anyone will simply die over the graphics in this game they are much superior to any other graphics that have ever been in a n64 geme i higly recomend the game soooooo why are you still reading this? you should be out buying this game as I type gooooooo what r u waiting 4?????????????????????????
5,The best Zelda yet!,"A great game, it's worth the title of game of the year! Amazing graphics and rich characters give this game the edge! A must buy for anybody with a 64!"
5,THE BEST GAME NINTENDO HAS YET MADE,"This game is the best game nintendo has ever made. You explore seven different areas. It is the most complex game, too. There are one hundred DIFFERENT places to find some gold scultulas. Seven very tricky dungens. And you have to go back to being a kid, then an adult, and back to a kid. This game isn't for you if you do not know how to read. If you like to fight monsters this is for you. It is good for parents who do not want to have their kids killing people and things. There are some scary and maybe even startleing things that might come up to you. This game is very adventues AND it is in the older days so you might like the scenery. Hope you liked my explanation."
4,Zelda: Ocarina Of Time Review,"This was a great product I had bought from a loyal and fast service seller. I had this game when I was little, and I missed it, and bought it extremely cheap and it works very well. I was very impressed!"
5,The Best Game to Buy for the Nintendo 64!,"I've never played a better game than this. Adventure is everywhere! This is my favorite sort of game. I like being able to just roam around instead of going through a level, you know? You feel like you are actually involved with your game and its adventure.That's not how every game should be. But I hope there are many more games like this in the future."
5,THIS IS SUCH A KOOL GAME!!!!!!!!! ITS GOT EVERYTHING IN IT!!,THIS IS SUCH A KOOL GAME!!!!!!!!! ITS GOT EVERYTHING IN IT!
1,Wrong information on web page,"... I purchased the game for him and he waited patiently. But he was very disappointed when it arrived. It was for Nintendo 64, not game cube. When the web page came up, nowhere did it say Nintendo 64. Since we had typed in Ocarina of Time Game cube in the search box, we thought that it took us to a page where they were selling the game cube games. Well that shows that buying online is not always a good idea. Now we have a game we cannot use."
1,The biggest waste of money ever,"Seriously, this ranks up with some of the worst games I have ever played. It is a complete insult to anyone who respects the RPG genre as this is nothing more than a linear, cutesy, puzzle game. You run around playing a little harmonica by pressing certain buttons in certain orders and the rest of the time you are moving boxes around, jumping from platform to platform, and killing enemies (with an awful targeting system) that respawn as soon as you leave the room.I can guarantee that about 95% of all the 4 and 5 star votes are coming from children under the age of 15 as this is the type of game that would appeal to them. But if you are an older, more experienced gamer do yourself a favor and steer clear from this hideous example of a good title gone bad.If you'll excuse me I am going to balance out my wobbly kitcken table with the cartridge."
4,Good back then,"This is still a great game to own, especialy if you missed it, but the graphics are dated. If you have a GameCube, find a way to get it on there, and be happy you did."
5,"FUN, FUN, FUN IN THE SHADE!","Buy this before its gone! Its at a low price, just buy it for the hell of it! You're gonna want this before its gone for good. Great graphics, awesome story, and fun to play. Can be challenging at times, but you'll get though. If you don't buy a strategy guide or go to cheatcc.com or gamefaqs.com...Classic Zelda gameplay at its best. You have a huge amount of weapons to hinder your foes. I don't want to waste your time ranting on and on so just trust me on this one: BUY NOW!"
5,It was Great,Zelda was one of the best games I ever played and I played allot of games in my life. It was hard at some part and also complicated but the game was still as fun.
5,ONE OF THE BEST GAMES OF ALL TIME!,"This is definatley my all time favourite game. The graphics are excellent (check out Ganondorf's black stallion, so realistic!), it has an interesting storyline and really individual and fascinating characters. I love the fact you can travel back in time from young Link (hero of our story) to adult Link. It is not one of those games were you finish it in one day and thats it, there are so many mini-games, treasures to find and many exciting dungeons and bosses, this game will have you glued to the screen for ages! Also the cinematic scenes are excellent which you will see all throughout the game. I have completed this game and the ending is one of the best of any game. Be careful of some difficult puzzles but nothing undoable. All this in a word: MASTERPIECE (p.s. I also recommend A Link to the Past, Majora's Mask and The Wind Waker)"
5,PIT card game,"AWESOME game!!! It's been around for a while, but I just discovered it.Easy to learn, even for kids. Addicting, cause you can play for hours.Kids like it because you can be noisy. The more players you have themore fun and exciting the game is!"
5,FUN FUN FUN!!!,I have looked all over for this game in differewnt stores with no success. I was so happy to find it on Amazon. LOVE PLAYING WITH FAMILY...EVEN THE YOUNG ONES CAN DO IT EASILY!!!
5,"Jump up and down, roll on the floor, climb on the table fun.","BUY THIS GAME. It's the best family/friend game I've ever played and it just about broke my heart when they stopped printing it. There's no better way to get kids riled up before bed or break the ice at an informal party. I've played it w/ my grandparents, little cousins, college roommates, anyone who will play. This is one great time, over and over again."
3,Swimmy electronic folk.,"This album sounds like a Hum CD that was dropped in a bathtub. Watery, soft electronic sounds make a bland background to nearly folk-vocals. Shades of Radiohead and Beck are heard, without the originality. An average recording."
1,Awful.,This was an awful video introduction to lathe machining. Recap: Always wear goggles. Never leave your chuck in the bit. Followed by a very poor overview of the parts of a lathe without any description of the purpose of the part. The majority of this 48 minute video is watching a single part being cut (out of focus). A very unprofessional and disappointing product. Save your money.
4,Go Ape Over This Book,"The Legend Of The Planet Of The Apes By Brian Pendreigh is rightup there with Eric Greene's Planet Of The Apes As American Myth,and almost quite ae scholarly. Pendreigh's book uncovers the REAL reason why Edward G. Robinson did not become Dr. Zaius. Moments of unintended humor, such as the author being shut out of Charleton Heston's limo pick up, due to the actor's need forleg room, with the author following behind the limo on foot.The small, yet interesting color photo section contained manybehind the scenes photographs I have never seen before. Forexample I have never seen a photograph of a miniature of Ape City. The wonderful thing about this book is that the authordid his homework by backing himself up with named sources. Mr.Pendreigh showed a real appreciation for his subject matter.This book is great for either the casual Apes fan or The Keeper's Of The Faith. Personally I could not put this book down. Thank you Brian, great work!"
5,Fun story about his life....,"Great story about the life of Jerry Stiller and his experiences in life and show business. He leads you though his life with stories and lessons learned, and shares his love of his family and friends."
1,Not Accurate!,We had to return this book because it was filled with wrong chords and wrong keys. How on earth did it get published?? Don't waste your money!
4,Actually not so bad...,"I don't really mind this book. I've read several not great reviews. The few songs I have tried so far have the right chords. Some of the lyrics aren't 100 percent correct and not always placed in the right spot (if detailed phrasing is an issue for you, but you can figure it out easily enough).I like it because it is compact and complete. Really helped me to figure out some difficult timing issues I'd encountered (i.e., Romance in Durango taking a little detour from 4/4 to 1/4 in a few spots...cute). Side note: As this is a very Spanish sounding tune, perhaps that is how some Spanish songs roll.Aww, I dunno. I like the Bob pic on the front and so far the binding has held up fine and ...oh my gosh 325 freaking songs! Any half ass musician can figure out a few of the glitches or transpose here and there. I say, get it and enjoy!"
2,Inaccurate,"Well I bought this book at a guitar shop about 30 minutes from my house... and have come to find out and am 100 % sure that the majority of the chords they give you are not anything close to any version that Bob Dylan played and by majority i mean you will only find about 3 songs in the entire book that will have somewhat accurate chords.. Off the top of my head an example would be blowin' in the wind.. In the book it starts with an Eb then so on, when in blowin in the wind the only chords played are C, F, G.... or G, C, D.. aside from rare versions.. the only reason why I gave it two stars was because it has all the lyrics lined up and if you get the right chords its still useful"
2,dont get them wet,"I got these for metal detecting in the fall .I used them in 20+ degree weather and they did okay until I got them wet from the dirt and then they froze my finger tips. They are quality gloves with good materials and workmanship but if they advertise them towards cold weather then they are way off base. I put on some regular mechanix gloves from my truck and kept going and my hands stayed warmer than the cold comfort gloves .And once they get damp, forget it, you are better off with your bare hands in your pockets ."
1,Dog Leash,"A real dog walker would not like this leash. It does not have a temporary brake on it, strickly on or off. The leash does not retract well. It cannot be used on an active dog or a large one. Not impressed at all with this product."
5,"This collection will make you laugh, and make you angry","Tom Tomorrow's cartoons are like the Daily Show. They quickly, with humor, point out the hypocosies in modern politics that the major news outlets ignore. I especially like that you can look back in time and see that America's mistakes in Iraq were obvious to many people while we were making them, not just ""monday morning quarterbacks""."
5,"Loved it as a kid,, still love it!","I played this game as a kid! Can't find it in stores, but found it on Amazon! I love this game. Not a real fast game but it is fun. It's based on the first player to get to X amount of miles. While traveling, other players give you flat tires, accidents and out of gas cards, which make you stop, so you have recover and get another roll card to get going. You get to give other players flat tires, accidents and out of gas too!! It can all be quite frustrating!! but fun.Very educational too, for counting and learning processes. Awesome card game!"
5,Great game!,I've always had fun playing this card game as a kid. Children/adults learning French will like it too.
2,is a tortoise delivering this?,"I ordered this ""in-stock"" book on Sept. 7th. I received notice it was shipped on Sept. 10th & delivery could be as late as Sept 29th. SERIOUSLY????? If anyone sees a tortoise walking down the road with my book, please give him a ride!!!!"
1,Not for hikers,"I felt obligated to write a negative review when I saw that this book still has a four star average. While entertaining enough to finish, it was disapointing. If you have ever read an issue of Outside or Backpacker magazine, let alone Edward Abbey, you will probably be offended by many aspects of this book. I would recommend reading all the other reviews sorted from lowest rating first before paying money for it."
1,Generally negative.,"I was looking forward to reading this book the recommendation of a family member. Wow was I disappointed. The author spent most of the book complaining about everything and everyone. He hates the trail, the people on the trail, the people around the trail, the people who thought up the trail, ect...If you want to read a good book about the AT, try AWOL on the Appalachian Trail."
4,"Funny as ever, but fades in the second half","I bought this for a friend at Christmas, picked it up myself before I wrapped it, and then couldn't put it down. The first half is as hilarious as Bryson can be- delightfully laconic one-liners. The relationship with Katz is well handled. The book undoubtedly sags in the second half- slower moving and less witty. The near-disaster (I will give away no more) is truly poignant, though, and not something I associate with Bryson's writing. If you have enjoyed his previous writings you will like this too, even if its initial brilliance is not sustained."
4,Entertaining book,Bryson uses a comical approach to hiking the Appalacian Trail. After reading this book you'll either think that you HAVE to hike the trail or think that you'll NEVER want to hike the trail.
4,I like these kinds of books,"I really liked this book. I like to read occasional true adventure trips as long as they stay somewhat non serious, have some comedy and I like this book a lot."
2,Bill and Ted .... without the excellent adventure!,I liked the Historical side of it . Not very motivational . Felt like fiction at times. I've payed less for better books.
1,Disappointing,"Terrible. The synopsis leads you to believe that this man hiked the entire AT and he didn't even complete 1/3 of it. He constantly makes offensive comments about people he meets while hiking (particularly anyone from the South) and goes out of his way to make devisive political statements again and again. I will say that he has a good sense of humor in some parts, but that didn't make up for the offensive parts. Very disappointing, I regret buying this book and will not be reading any of Bryson's other books."
2,He didn't walk the whole trail!,"This is not a GUY book; worse, it is a real let-down. Bryson does give a good story of the places he does reach and I couldn't help laughing at the antics of Bryson and his buddy, Katz. But he gives up on the trail too early and he even gave up on the last 100 mile stretch."
3,An okay travel book,"This is a travel book and not a hiking/backpacking guide in any way. The book was enjoyable for the most part, but the authors sense of humor and writing gets on your nerves after a while. If you are looking for a book about a complete journey of the AT, look elsewhere because this book is really an over glorification of a sectional trip. I enjoyed the book as an entertaining read, but found myself wanting more towards the end."
2,Great characters outstripped by all-consuming griping,"Once again Bill Bryson has taken his acid wit on the road. Thank goodness he has matured since writing Neither Here Nor There and has developed the ability to appreciate locales other than England. If only he could have given us more of his and Katz's interaction and less of the diatribe on the National Parks Service, this book would have been a better one. While some statistics on endangered trees and animals would have been enlightening, the inclusion of so many was filler not substance."
2,Humour on the expense of almost everyone,"With great expectation I purchased this book hoping, naively, that it would be a hommage to the AT. It begins with a very good sense of humour, which, unfortunately, turns annoying after about the first half of the book, when the reader gets rather tired of all the negative descriptions of what the author encounters on his way along the AT. Very disappointing is that despite great announcements at the beginning of the book, Bryson actually never really hikes the whole trail, and apart from a small episode where, due to his own mispreparation, he gets a little cold a the top of one mountain in New Hampshire, nothing, absolutely nothing exciting happens. And as to his appreciation of nature, Bryson truely fails to convince the reader of his ability to give a balanced picture. In the end, the book makes fun of almost everything and everyone. If he is so appalled by the AT conference, what about some constructive criticism? The book is not worth the while!"
5,Excellent Reading,"I read ""A Walk in the Woods"" in about 3 days, as it was thoroughly enjoyable reading. His descriptions make me want to go back hiking but not particularly the Appalachian trail. I will recommend the book to all my friends, I love the description as well as his humor. I am sorry that I have finished it."
2,"""Political Correctness"" Detracts from Author's Hiking Humor","Bill Bryson is a funny guy, and his Appalachian Trail experience -- from his pre-trip hysteria about bears, to his rather lame rationale for hiking only part of it -- makes for enjoyable reading. But his relentless ranting on ""politically correct"" themes detracts from his vivid descriptions. I want to know what hiking the AT is like -- not endure endless cliches about global warming, acid rain, evolution, and how idiotic Southerners are. He's lucky enough to get paid for having adventures. Why ruin it with political rants?"
4,A funny and often poignant look at the AT,This is clearly not meant to be a book about hiking. That is what makes this book so enjoyable. We can all relate to his tiring but innocuous events while hiking the trail. Interspersed amongst the hilarious episodes are stinging indictments of our national parks policies. The details he uses to explain the detioration of the parks are shocking. A book to learn from and enjoy.
2,A snobbish look at America,"I am a huge fan of Appalachian Trail narratives, tough I really found this one petty and snobbish. It basically thumbed its nose at America, while complaining about the hike the entire time. A very uninspiring ending just tops the cherry on an overrated work."
3,Not really for me...,"After reading ""Notes from a Big Country"" which is probably the funniest book I've ever read in my life (being a European with a close connection to the US), I've been looking for more books by Bryson. So this time I decided to try ""A Walk in the Woods"". I guess the more of your own experiences reflect in the book the funnier and more interesting you'll find it. I've never done any long distance hiking, let alone the Appalachian trail, so other than learning some interesting background information on the history of the trail, some sad facts about our environment and the stupidity of humanity, I only found this book mildly amusing and in some parts even boring. Sorry!"
5,This is one of his best !,"Bill has done it again, this is a masterpiece. I actually laughed out loud as I read and then into part 2 wished the book would never end... I just love this guy !!!! But then I'm from Iowa too !"
3,Interesting,"This was an interesting read but it lacked the drama, excitement and challenge of WILD by Sheryl Strayed a amazing tale of the challenge of hiking the Pacific Coast Trail."
4,"Funny , entertaining adventure story",A Walk in the Woods was very funny and entertaining. It was also very human. I found the scientific parts educational and not at all boring. Inspiring; at least he got out there and tried something! I was laughing out loud throughout the book.
1,Another mid-life crisis book,"I have hiked part of the trail and dream of doing the entire route. This is one of several AT hiking books I purchased because the title suggests it covered the trail. Bryson's book is entertaining, loaded with laughs and speckled with bits of trail pearls, but boils down to a story of two overweight smokers with midlife crises who try trail hiking. This is akin to two college dropouts writing about getting a graduate degree. You will learn little regarding backpacks, shoes, tents, sleeping bags or other equipment. You learn even less about how to condition yourself for distance hiking. This book was a let down for me because I expected something else. Reading about two big boys' ice cream cravings and littering the trail during a partial hike left me nonplussed."
1,Couldn't even finish it.,"This is one of those books that is written for a European audience, with all the currently trendy, shallow prejudices that are currently marketed by their mass media. It has very little to do with the Appalacian Trail, which he abandons halfway through the book after traversing a small fraction of its length. The author can't even tell the difference between the National Park Service and the Bureau of Land Management. But hey, at least it has wit. Half of it, anyway. The time I spent reading it was utterly wasted, but Europeans ought to enjoy it. For Americans, find something else to read, like Twain's ""Innocents Abroad"", for example."
1,Offensive,"Beware, any readers who take offense at foul language and talk of bestiality surfacing in the guise of a travelogue! And excuse me, but the use of the Name of Jesus Christ as an exlamation or a curse word does offend me. These are things I just never expected from a book like this. Maybe I shouldn't be surprised given the day we are living in and the lewdness of society at large.It is a shame as the author can be quite humorous at times and the topic is an interesting one. Maybe I'm old-fashioned, but when I pick up a book I like to be transported and uplifted from the mundane. On the contrary, this book dragged me into an irreverent world of bad language and filthy talk where it just wasn't called for.Never again will I be tempted to purchase another book by this author. I'm sorry I purchased this one."
3,disappointed,"Excellent writing. I loved the style, and was excited to read another book about one of my favorite subjects, hiking, and the A.T. I have one big complaint, however. Fairly frequent crude references and words ruined the book for me. I was quite disappointed. I couldn't finish it."
3,five stars on the hiking; one star on the preaching,I enjoyed the book a great deal until they left the trail in Gatlinburg. The narrative of the Shennandoah and Maine Wilderness were also superb. I was disappointed by all of the car-hiking and Mr. Bryson's contempt for apparently everyone else but himself; he is probably the most self-righteous person I have read an account of in recent years.
2,Disappointing,"I was told to buy this book and it was a must read for a serious hiker like I am. What a big disappointment. I hate reading hiking reports where they start off, and keep, whinning and complaining about everything. I also expected that he was actually going to walk the whole thing and straight through (he was writing a book about this experience!). Instead these two out of shape slobes walk and complain from one shelter to the next and couldn't wait for the next hotel/restaurant. Then they poop out after just a small portion. He then took a break and came back later closer to home, skipping a big portion. For filler for the book, since he didn't have much ""good"" hiking to talk about, he fills it with miscellaneous tid bits."
1,"Begins humourously; quickly becomes boring, opinionated and ugly.","If you want to read about the natural world then read Muir, Leopold, Thoreau, et al but don't waste your time with this. However, if you want to read about why there are empty cream soda cans on the AT, or that it's OK to steal another hiker's bootlaces, or why the AT should have less wilderness and more cheeseburgers then this book is for you.If you want to read about 2 overweight ill-prepared hikers, one of whom is afraid of the woods and remains so, then this will thrill you. If you want to learn how to rationalize you did something without actually doing it then this is your guide."
5,great service,I was very pleased with the quick delivery of the three books that I ordered. They were all in great condition. I would definitely use the seller again.
4,A fun trip,I read this book a few years ago and laughed out loud through the whole book. Now that I know a little more about hiking the trail I wanted to go back and visit the trail with Bill again. It was still funny but had deeper meaning to me about the mental process hikers go through. I would very much recommend this book to any one who wants an adventure without leaving the couch.
3,Funny but cruel and judgemental. Inaccurate in parts.,"What a shame that a wry sense of humor took a back seat to a need to be superior to others. The need to demean the South as in the Hiawassee comments was truly in poor taste. The description is also inaccurate. Mr. Bryson did not describe this beautiful and friendly area as I have found it. Having been to Hiawassee at the time he describes, I wondered how much of the rest of the book was accurate and if Stephen Katz and other characters ever existed beyond his own mind. P.S.: I'm from the sixth borough (South Florida) via South Boston. Don't even consider a need on my part to defend the Confederacy, only literary integrity."
2,How Disappointing!,"I wanted to really like this book, but I was just offended. Apparently the only reason the author had to hike the A.T. was to gather material for the book. Everytime Bill or his companion were frustrated by the rigors of the trail, it seemed that they ""got even"" by throwing excess weight into the woods. Har Har!The author spends a lot of time talking about how scary bears are, and how everything is going to hell in a handbasket, but most of the AT he day hikes using his car. I just don't think he got it.Although the personal anecdotes are entertaining, I just can't get the bad taste the whining (and other very visible shortcomings) left in my mouth.-A PATC memberP.S., any guesses as to his trail name? My thought is that he didn't spend enough time on the A.T. to have one...."
2,Not that great,"As most have mentioned this book was kind of a let down for me. My reading experience of this book is comparable to Bryson's A.T. hiking experience. I skimmed through the really boring parts.I bought this book hoping that it would be an account of his day to day experiences on the trail, but found myself reading historical information about the trail. I truly enjoyed reading the first quarter of the book, but it seemed that half way through the book Bryson attempted to fill the pages of this book with statistical info where there should have been personal experiences.Just bought AWOL on the AT... hope it will be better."
4,Cover Observation,I just wanted to point out that somebody had the stupid idea to put a picture of a Grizzly Bear on the cover of this book. You will find no Grizzly Bears along the AT. It's funny too because this is to me the kind of ignorance that Bill Bryson makes us laugh about in the book. It makes me wonder just where the picture of the woods on the cover was taken.
2,Tell the truth please,The book like others on the Appalachian Trail give the impression they are going to tell you of there adventure along the ENTIRE length of the Applachian Trail. I found myself remarking at my foolishness for buying this book. I could not believe the last part of the book after he quits the trail. Could someone actually have the guts to publish a book about their inability to finish the trail. DRIVING to small sections of the it by car to describe 3 mile sections..............eeeegads!!!!
5,IT INSPIRED ME!,"Before I started this review I read a few comments from folks who felt Mr. Bryson deserved much less than five stars. My goodness, we humans are a diverse group of Homo sapiens. There was this one 1-star review from an anal person who surely read a different book than I. Actually, I felt sorry for him because if he let this lightweight, humorous book get his briefs all tangled up in his...well...you know...then real life must be hell. Anyway, I see I'm digressing here. Who cares if he walked the entire AT; it was the adventure and the excellent way in which he told his story--spinning interesting factoids, humor and honest yet not-so-flattering (but funny) observations--that made this book so wonderful. I loved it so much in fact it has inspired me to walk the AT too. I'm in training now. Yesterday I walked to the mailbox and back. AT, here I come."
5,A Walk in the Woods,"Written for the adult crowd, this book appeals to a wide audience. It is the story of a middle-aged man who decides to tackle the Appalachian trail. His preparation, the long lost friend who accompanies him, the hiking ordeal, and the people he meets along the way, are humorously described. Readers will laugh aloud. Bryson adds to his story by interspersing history lessons along his way. We learn about the Appalachian trail and its history, environmental concerns in national parks, and side tales of other hikers on the trail. Bryson's easy to read style makes this a hard book to put away. His struggle to finish the trail captivates the reader and his humor is delightful. Recommended for young adults learning about the environment, interested in adventure, and reluctant readers of nonfiction."
4,Gets me ready for spring!,"Bill Bryson, accompanied by his crazy friend Stephen Katz, has decided on a whim to hike the Appalachian Trail. A whim! Not the best approach to an incredibly difficult 2000+ mile hike. The two of them are completely out of shape and definitely unprepared for what they have signed on for.As the book progresses, Bryson shares not only how they came to terms with the fact that perhaps they had taken on a bit more than they should have, but some truly great information about life on the trail. There is a history of the AT, ecological information, and even a smattering of backwoods tips (mostly centering on Bryson's fear of bear attacks).Overall, A Walk in the Woods is a very humorous book--full of laughs primarily at the author's expense. At the same time, the true beauty of nature juxtaposed with the disaster of modern day America stands out in sharp relief. This is one of the few books I would say warranted its time on the bestseller list."
1,"Mean-spirited, fictionalized and not funny","I was hoping for a funny, honest look at the Appalachian trail, but this book is neither. I was very disappointed and offended by the hateful stereotypes. The author comes across as a smug, mean-spirited, and deeply misanthropic person and his accounts are obviously highly fictionalized. How anyone could be fooled into thinking that this book is a true account is beyond me. The only thing that comes across as honest is the author's prejudiced attitude toward fellow humans. I actually threw this book in the recycle bin rather than give it away and inflict it on anyone else."
2,"Egads, what a bore","Nope, I didn't get it. This book is the poster child for the ""books by people with too much time on their hands"" category. Bryson sells himself as an acute observer of the everyday -- the problem is, the everyday isn't always that interesting, and even when it is he doesn't do it justice. The first few pages were mildly interesting but the rest of the book went downhill from there. He might have done better had he actually walked the whole trail. The fact that he walked parts of it and spent a lot of time on breaks eating junk food pretty much sums up the quality of his writing."
2,2/5th of this book was very good.,"For most non-hiking, city folk I am sure this book was a hoot. For the first 1/2, there were quite a few moments of levity - although some of the jokes seemed imagined. The last 1/2 was tedious. If this wasn't fiction, then Bryson never seemed to 'get' hiking. He didn't like to be alone, he didn't like people, he was afraid of everything, etc.My favorite part was when he berates Katz for going back on the bottle and then sits down for his umpteenth smoke of the hike.I would have much preferred to read Bryson for 1/2 book and then Katz for the other 1/2 (if he exists). I would bet that Katz has a different tale to tell.My rating is 2/5th because that is the distance that Bryson says he hiked. I think the book should have cost 2/5th - just to be fair."
3,A Walk in the Wooods,A walk in the woods starts out to be a fuuny book. It makes you laugh at the begining but makes you dont want to read it at the end. It has lots of good detial describing what was going on what they did and what happened on the Applachian trail. I recommend that you should not buy but check it out of the library.
2,A very depressing book,"This book was billed as being funny. Unless you find acid rain, aniliation of trees and polution problems funny, it's not a funny book. It's more of a diatribe of how humans have destroyed (intentionally or inadvertantly) the land we live on. It's not like I don't know that we've destoyed timberlands, but I don't need to read about it - especially for a ""funny"" book. The best part of this book was the ending - because I was finished reading it."
3,Not enough about hiking,It really was not what I expected. Large portions of the book had nothing to do with hiking. Still very entertaining.
4,A Walk/Ride in the Woods,"The reader below who complained about Bryson missed the subtle irony and satire in the book. Yes, its true: Bryson failed. He never accomplished his goal. But the journey from dream to failure is what makes the book so funny. I loved this book...to a point. About 3/4 of the way, it just dies. I'd recommend reading it all the way until he gets home (the first time)."
3,Katz capers,"A very entertaining book. Mainly due to Bill Bryson's sarcastic wit and his friend, Stephen Katz. He is one funny dude. I thought the book meandered a bit when Bryson was hiking along but picked up again when Katz came back into the picture."
4,decent read.,"Bryson has a written an interesting look at the AT. Not as funny as the cover suggests...though there are some funny passages.While I suggest that you read A walk in the woods....I must disagree to the claim that bryson in the ""best adventure writer today"". That title belongs to Tim Cahill."
4,The Appalachian Trail - truth or fiction?,"I read this book several years ago laughing more than my fair share over Bryson's obsession with bears. I have since read exerpts from other Bryson books, and realized that reading this one first, is as good as it gets for Bryson. His humor is at its best in this book - it isn't mean, (...) humor as in other Bryson books, and maybe, he really did walk the trail. I enjoyed his discussions of the government agencies that ""sustain"" our national parks, etc. However, I have noticed that Bryson has a tendency to embellish the truth and is prone to exaggerate. So my question - is Katz a real person?"
3,A Walk Becomes A Drag,"Everyone told me how ""hilarious"" this book was. I decided to read it. The first half of the book is SO funny that you will probably have a hard time not laughing out loud. Note: Do not read it alone, in public! :o)Then you get to the second half of the book. What starts out as a comedic ""average joe"" adventure turns into a political statement. Blah, blah, blah. As if someone else wrote the first part of the book, Mr. Bryson decides to venture into coma-inducing historical facts, all the while giving his dry opinion of the government and park service. ZZZZZ ... oh, sorry. I dozed off just thinking about it.If you read this book, I recommend doing what Bryson and Katz did (warning: SPOILER). Only complete half and then give up."
1,It's a shame,"I needed to write a review because this book disappointed in so many ways. Instead of reiterating all those very good negative reviews, (i had more laughs reading all the 3 star and under reviews here than reading this book) I'll just say, i would really enjoy hearing from the the people who encountered Bryson and Katz on (and off) the AT I'm sure that would be far more interesting and funny than this book!"
2,Overrated,"There are some good points that Bryson makes about ecology, communities, government agencies and the other aspects of the AT, but overall I think the book is overrated. I didn't get a lot out of the book and was actually left disappointed upon completing it. If I learned one thing from reading the book is that you can't always believe the hype."
5,Truly great - great writing and coverage of App Trail,"This was my first Bill Bryson book. I'm now a fan of his writing. In this book he's done a great job of describing what it is like to hike the Appalachian Trail. He describes the detail behind the trail, the problems he had to overcome, and the pleasures of hiking this trail. It will (or has) become a classic.This book is highly recommended. I'm now going to buy his ""Short History of Everything."" A young friend of ours (high school age) is reading that book now and really recommends it.I think what I like about Bryson's style is his humor. Every page forces me to smile, and every a couple of pages he has something that forces out a loud chuckle. He provides lots of background material (about the trail) and also gives you a history lesson (previous walkers).John DunbarSugar Land, TX"
3,"Enjoyable, but I have doubts","This was an enjoyable book to read and I was very interested in the many statistics presented with regard to our national parks and trails, etc., but after reading the author's assertion that the average American walks less than 1.4 miles per week, I started to wonder about the accuracy of his facts. For a person to walk less than 1.4 miles per week, they would have to take less than 450 steps per day. A person would have to be practically on bedrest to walk that little. Even on my sluggish days when I do nothing but read and watch t.v. I usually accumulate 4,000 or so. While I agree that the average American may not walk much at all, I have my doubts about the 1.4 mile statistic presented in the book."
1,Highly overrated self congratulatory trek,"Bill Bryson was ill prepared for a hike of 2000 miles heading north on the Appalachian Trail. His old high school buddy was even less equipped. I found the book boring and not at all funny. Bryson's writing style evidences an attitude of contempt toward fellow hikers and a complete disrespect for the rigors of the Trail It is no surprise that neither man was able to complete the trek. It is only fortunate that no one was seriously injured, the physically out of shape writer and pal or other hikers. I still wonder why Bryson wrote this book. Tim of Glen Alan, Virginia has expressed many of my reactions to ""A Walk in the Woods."" If you want to learn about America, read Charles Kurault. If you want humor, read Roy Blount, Jr."
2,Troubling: Where Is Leave No Trace,"As someone who has done a lot of backpacking, I found this book troubling. While it gets at the absurdity of the technical aspects of long distance hiking in a humorous way, it demonstrates an utter lack of respect for the environment of the trail. Years of effort of attempting to have hikers pack out what they pack in is destroyed by this book. Tossing cans of Spam and soda cans along the trail is not the sort of back-country literature we need. Funny or not more care should be taken by a writer with Bryson's credentials."
3,Great story... but Jr High language not necessary....,"THE GOOD PART:I want to start off by saying the plot of the book and the basic history and geography lessons included were great..5 stars.Bryson did a great job of telling a story about the AT and America as seen on the trail. It was an easy read and very hard to put down at times. Never hard to pick up where I left off.THE BAD:I do take offense to the Jr Hi language used thru out. It is not necessary. Even kids in Sr Hi, grow out of using the F BOMB... It takes from the story and I likely will not ask my kids to read the story because of it. Why do many people think they need to include BAD language to get a rating. That is what kept this book from earning 5 stars in my opinion.Are Bryson's other books the same? I will not be tempted to buy any more if they are the same.Bryson- time to grow up and realize there are some family's who do not need this type of humor to entertain us."
1,Don't bother,"This book reads like the author was assigned by his boss to write about the trail. The unoriginal ... jokes about his chubby friend and carrying everything but the kitchen sink in his backpack are mildly humorous at first, then just get tedious after repeating them ad nauseum. To complete his 'assignment' he adds in filler in the form of factual/historical dialog that reads as if it were taken straight from park brochures.I was really disappointed in this book, considering the acclaim it has received."
3,Overly dramatic,"I have read dozens of AT books for the past 3 years or so because I plan on beginning a hike Spring 2003. If you are wanting to know anything about the trail, you do not want this book. This book was written to be funny, but frankly I found it to be bordering on obnoxious. The author has no heart for the trail and barely hikes enough of its length to ""rediscover America"". The author also goes off onto tangents by descriptively explaining the geology, history, and fauna of the trail. I guess I was just expecting a book that focused on the hiker's camaraderie with nature and other hikers."
3,Begins strong but fizzles,"I bought this book based on an excerpt from Outside magazine. The excerpt and some of the parts that follow are the best parts and unfortunately the story fizzles about halfway through. I don't blame bryson, who is a master storyteller, but his travels just became less interesting with the departure of his companion, Katz. Still, it's a pretty good read with some interesting history interspersed. It made me want to read his story of a trip with Katz to Europe.Also recommended: Bad Trips -- collected stories of vacation disasters. Pillars of Hercules -- paul Theroux"
2,A Good Writer but.....,"This is my first Bill Bryson book. I will say he does tell a good story about his travels but....the reviews as well as the book gave the impression he would tell his story throughout the Appalachian Trial. I don't mind reading about abandoned coal mines etc. but then I would buy a book on THAT subject. This book should be called ""A WALK IN THE WOODS THEN A LOT OF DRIVING THEN SOME MORE WALKS, DRIVNG, WALKING, DRIVING, QUITING."" Get this one from the library."
3,A short walk in the woods,"Someone gave me this book and I'm glad I didn't buy it. Bryson didn't make it all the way on the AT but I guess I shouldn't have expected it - he never really said that was the goal. I think it is useful as a travel journal with references to places and their history but don't look for anything very deep. Bryson seemed to be content with spending a few days at a time on the trail and keeping notes on all the rubes he met along the way. This soured the rest of the book for me, much like some of the comments from The Lost Continent. Rather than actually getting to know anyone along the way, he just heads on down the trail looking for someone else to deride."
5,LOVE BILL...LOVE THIS BOOK,"I love all Bill's books, this was no different. Living less than 20 miles from Centralia, PA which is mentioned in book, I can attest he gives very accurate info on the history of the mining town, as well as, a very vivid and detailed description of its current appearance. This alone made me aware of the accuracy of his writing(s) on the places he visits and experiences. The negative comments(reviews) towards his ""hiking experience"" confuse me, he does attest(to his credit) as being an expert on the subject of hiking must less walking, this is HIS EXPERIENCE as HE EXPERIENCED IT....great read, funny, real, light, entertaining..."
2,Not about hiking the Appalachian Trail,"This book is not about hiking the Appalachian Trail. It is about Bill's failure to hike the trail. The book does show us about sections of the trail (aka areas of our country) but he unfairly portrays some of the areas and the people. In fact, he makes fun of them. The saddest part is that Bill did not truly experience/hike the trail and too many people think this book is a good example of AT hiking. How wrong."
5,"Entertaining, Rollicking Read","I truly enjoyed this book. Normally I prefer stories of true adventure, as in something that involves a taste of danger. I was surprised to find myself smiling all the way through this book. Bill Bryson is a very talented writer, and he turns something rather unremarkable into a great story. Hilarious and thoroughly enjoyable!"
5,Parents in a twist,"Although my 3 year old grandson knows his shapes and colors, he was not tall or long enough to reach the spots. He adapted the game so that he was in charge of the spinner and his parents did the ""twisting"". He was thouroughly entertained and felt powerful in getting his parents into a twist. As he grows he will be all the more eager to play the game according to the real rules."
4,Twister revisited......,"I have given this game to my 18-year-old college daughter within the past year,and am now planning to give it as a Christmas gift to my 12-year-old niece.It requires physical activity, which many pre-pre-teens(8-11yrs.) & pre-teens(12-15yrs.), don't get outside of organized sports. Every house should have this on their shelves,as it's been on ours' for some 30 years.(I actually rated this game as: 4=fun, 5=educational value, 5=durabillity. ...."
3,You get what you should expect for the size,"First, if you need a digital camera, don't choose this unit as your first purchase. Get yourself a 2-3 megapixel camera. Second, it's a 640x480 ultra (repeat ULTRA) compact digital camera. Because of the size of the lens, the quality of the pictures are much lower that you'd get with almost any other camera, even at that low of a resolution.However, it's super portable (smaller than a pack of gum), rechargable via USB, holds 80+ pictures, and is great for taking thumbnails of items for later viewing. Picked mine up on discount elsewhere for $30, which is a deal for anyone who want to always have the opportunity to take small digital pictures. Wait until you can get this cheap."
4,Give This Wonderful Lady Her Grammy!,"This is definitely a solid album for Siedah. Shecan really rock n roll! She not only has the vocal prowessbut the lyrical depth to make one sit and listen.I have long respected her talent. She did an awesometurn with Brand New Heavies on their sorely underratedalbum ""Shelter."" The only thing missing from thisconsistently wonderful album is another heartfelt balladlike ""Nothin' At All and she could have nixed ""I Know It's OnlyRock N Roll."" With a set this strong that was a hoeky throwaway. But, who know's... Maybe she added it because she reallylikes the song. Well done, Siedah!"
5,Super dinner-party fun!,"What a great evening! I highly recommend this particular murder mystery if you're just starting out. Almost everybody can play the roles, costuming is fairly easy, and you generally won't get many complaints about either the dinner menu or background music you might want to play. (When my husband and I hosted, we even set up a small dance floor and we all jitterbugged the night away once we'd finished the game!) If you're going to try a dinner party murder-mystery game, try this one first."
3,Fair Ball: A Fan's Case for Baseball,An interesting book...if you like reading term papers. Costas makes a lot of good points that seemed to be well thought out but the book was a hard read. I nodded off a couple of times while reading it on a buisness trip.
5,a marvelous achievement!,"""Work with Meaning, Work with Joy is a refreshing guide and wonderfully rich overview of the spiritual renaissance taking place in workplaces around the world today. Pat Sullivan is to be congratulated on a marvelous achievement.""John Renesch, business futurist, author of Getting to the Better Future, and editor, New Traditions in Business"
3,"Great Pump, But No Replacement Hose","I bought this pump a couple of years ago at Walmart. It has been a really good pump. One of the deciding factors in buying the pump was that it was made so you could easily replace the rubber hose on it. As with all rubber hoses they eventually get dry rot and crack. I went to get a replacement hose for it at Walmart. They do not carry any in stock with the bicycle accessories. I tried the hardware stores and they did not have any hoses that fit correctly either. I then went to the internet searching for a replacement hose. I have yet to find any, even on Bell's website. This is disappointing because it would be an easy fix."
2,Poor quality,Not worth it. The pump fell apart (hose broke at nozzle) after a year's use. Next purchase will be of higher quality.
1,Should be listed as Christian fiction.,This book felt more like Christian fiction than fantasy. Not that that is bad but it was not at all what I thought I was buying. Just not my cup of tea.
1,HP 92275A Cartridge from Target,I followed the directions for opening and inserting the cartridge into my printer. When I tried to print toner went everywhere. It was all over the printed page as well as the entire stack of paper and the inside of the printer.
4,"Great Game, horrible Quality","Played this game many times, it really does make you think hard to win, and playing logic games are really important for people of all ages I think.There are a couple of things wrong with this though.The box is comes in is very very flimsy. Top of the gaming shelf for sure.You can keep all the pieces inside its Trap door though, Unfortunately you have to mix the Guess Pegs with the scoring pegs to do so. There is a divider between the game pegs and the scoring pegs, but it doesn't do a very good job of dividing.Many of the scoring pegs are too big to fit in the scoring holes. I Had to keep a pair of pliers near me while playing in order to try and squeeze the plastic on them to fit in the holes.Its all made of hard plastic so it will last forever as long as you don't loose the pieces, but the Quality control and storage design cut a lot of corners"
4,Two people fun depending on ability,"We got this for my 10 year old daughter for Christmas & although she is admittedly smart, the game doesn't seem as much of a challenge for her. The same holds true for any adult player. It hasn't taken more than six lines to solve any given puzzle. However, my 7 year old loves it and is a bit more challenged, but will probably conquer the strategy pretty soon. Still, a classic game with classic, good family fun. I would buy it again and it was more appropriately priced at $[...]. The only drawback we've seen is that the colors of the pegs were kind of ""off"", as in not classic colors and they don't all fit in their storage area so they fall out when trying to store away."
4,Warning on the shipped product colors!!!,"This is great ""mind"" game, however I received it from Amazon but I must write here a warning note about the game's board colors that are just horrible!!! The image on the product page has nothing to do with the frightful blue-yellow colors of the board shipped. Obviously it isn't the original MasterMind I was supposed to buy, very dissapointing. Its manufacturer looks poor also. Too bad for a game as good as this. You have been warned."
5,"marvelous, marvelous","At My Most Beautiful is a great song of course. And then there's the other two songs, which is why I really bought this single. Passenger is just great, marvelous fun, and Michael finally get the audience to sing a chorus on their own by the end =) Besides, this has to be one of the best versions of Country Feedback I've ever heard. Unbelievable. It's a little expensive I suppose, but I think it's worth it."
2,It's OK,"I wasn't expecting a sappy movie and it wasn't either, which I'm grateful for that. However, I was expecting this movie to be ""charming"" and ""sweet"" as it was described to me. It felt short of that in my eyes. Only Nigel's relationship with his mom was SOMEWHAT touching. Mrs. Potter was horrible and his father was worst. I didn't like it much."
2,Toast,"It's romantic to imagine that people with exceptional talents also have exceptional stories to tell about those talents. In the case of English food journalist Nigel Slater, it's somewhat true. Based on Slater's autobiographical novel of the same name, Toast recounts the writer's childhood growing up with an asthmatic mother who was such a poor cook that the only dish she ever mastered was, well, toast. When her illness finally gets the best of her, young Nigel and his father welcome a new addition to the family in the form of a housekeeper named Mrs. Potter, who soon wins over Nigel's father and engages Nigel himself in a sort of ongoing culinary rivalry. Toast was just a tad too saccharine for me, but I'll give it 2 stars, because I liked its breezy humor, visual touches, and judicious use of Helena Bonham Carter's talents. It's an unusual coming of age story, but its charms may just work for some."
2,Arrived very uneven and squshed,"I can tell this is a good bed, but the way it was shipped was not! I have had the bed for over a week and it still is misshaped. As my dog curls up in is he slowly starts to slid out of it due to the miss sharpen issue. I have attempted to stand on it to have it hold its shape but at the moment, I am using a wall to help prop it up to support the weight of my dog."
5,"Works well, great piece of equipment",The carrier mounted very easily on top of our Hyundai Tucson and kept our luggage dry through several snowstorms and subsequent thaws. I would highly recommend it!
5,Gorgeous playing,"I can't believe the negative reviews here - I'm so glad I was not swayed by them. This CD is GORGEOUS. Elegance, humor, finesse, sensitivity, style, virtuosity, sense of form... it's all here. The slow movements are breathtakingly and achingly beautiful. I think Haydn's piano sonatas are sorely underrated - listen to these and hear why."
4,awsome get-together game for teenagers and adults,This game is an awsome game! I highly suggest you buy it!
3,"Kinda fun, but gets old after a half-hour",This game is good fun for a little while. After a half hour we got bored and moved on to card games.
4,You will read this book all in one night,"Start before 11 pm and finish by 2 am. Great fun. I can't wait for the movie - it could surpass ""Die Hard.&quot"
5,This book was great. One of the best I've ever read!,"This was one of the best books I've ever read. It is a fast-paced, heart pounding thriller that you can't put down. The whole question of why they are after him pulls you into the story too. The story line has all the twists, turns and questions that readers love."
3,Predictable and Stereotypical,"This is a predictable story that blends ""Die Hard"" with ""Outbreak."" The dialogue is not believable. The story; disapointing. Give the ""Killer Virus"" genre a rest for a bit and skip reading this book."
2,Make sure you get the 2008 version of this card!!!,"SanDisk has pulled a fast one on us who are accustomed to the Extreme III & IV series. They've updated the Extreme III series with a new ""2008"" spec model. Yeah, so what... Well, the 2008 spec Extreme III 16GB CF card is almost twice as fast as the original ""20x"" Extreme III 16GB CF card in my Nikon D3. In fact, the 2008 16GB model is just marginally slower than my Extreme IV 8GB card in my D3. This speed increase makes a big difference for me when shooting motorsports in RAW mode and hyperactive children. Even crazier still, as of this review, Amazon is selling the 2008 spec Extreme III 16GB card for ~$15 less than this much slower model.Do yourself a favor before buying one of these cards and see how it will perform in your camera first... google for ""Rob Galbraith CF performance database"" and look up your camera. Buy intelligently!"
5,If you love comedy and hidden camera...,"You'll love Scare Tactics Season 3 Part 1 - UNCENSORED! Hosted by Tracy Morgan (30 Rock, SNL)Scare Tactics is easily the most innovative and outrageous hidden camera comedy show on TV. And Tracy Morgan is the perfect host to get the laughter going. The 2 DVD set contains 13 UNCENSORED episodes plus bonus footage including hilarious Tracy Morgan outtakes.The best part about this DVD set is that it is the ONLY PLACE where you can see the victims' real reactions - raw and unbleeped! The UNCENSORED versions of these Scare Tactics episodes can't be downloaded anywhere! So these DVDs are a MUST for true Scare Tactics fans.Disc One includes ""Satan's Baby"" which was voted #1 prank by VH1's ""40 Greatest Pranks"" special.See clips and exclusive video at the Scare Tactics YouTube channel."
1,Untrustworthy,"I bought the Windows version. It works OK for a while, then stops initializing on startup, LEAVING THE INTERNET WIDE OPEN FOR YOUR KIDS. Intego tech support very, very poor. Only suggestion has been to uninstall/reinstall, which I have done many times. I've seen others with the Windows version having the same problem. Don't know about their Mac version, but I'm not impressed with Intego."
2,Funny at times but mostly irritating,"I am a huge fan of Cathleen Schine's (even before The Love Letter) and while I usually wait until the paperback, I bought this one in hardback with great anticipation. Unlike Schine's previous works, I found this one to be mostly a chore, although there were moments of great humor. Jane is one of the most self-absorbed and self-deluded characters I've encountered lately. Maybe this was the point, I don't know, but if so, it was not funny or instructive in the least. Martha and the other characters were also uninteresting -- there was not a single likable character in the entire book. There was too much information about the Galapagos Islands, too. I was expecting a comedy, not a guidebook to the Galapagos..."
2,A disappointment for all Schine fans,"Where is the famous Schine blend of wit, humor and intelligence? I eagerly awaited this novel, having adored ""The Love Letter"" and ""Rameau's Niece."" However, after reading fifty pages of it, I'm loathe to pick it up again. A tedious, device-y novel, it certainly doesn't pick up any speed as it goes along. I'll try to finish it, but only out of reader's guilt and a sense of responsibility to Schine.A serious misstep."
2,Tedious,The story is promising but the endless essay-like reflections on evolution kill the heart of the novel. The link between evolution and friendship is interesting -- but without more depth and resolution of the human story it is ultimately empty.
2,Desert Winds,"If you are considering this CD for white noise, please consider once of the many CDs with flowing water, ocean waves, or thunderstorms. The winds in this CD shriek and sound a little scary. I will use it as background sounds when kids come to my house on Halloween."
1,Did not Work for me,"I bought this Adapter to connect my Accoustimass speakers in the pre-wired room and only one Channel (Left) worked, remaining did not work at all. I know the wires are all working as I can hear sound when I insert the wires into the left channel (the only channel that works)"
4,Well crafted thriller written with great passion.,"Mr. Cannell writes with great passion, and that distinguishes him from most of the other thriller writers around. This book also shows that he has thoroughly researched its subject: Asian gangs and their roots in Hong Kong. He also takes chances that most other thriller writers wouldn't take, such as making one of his main characters an African American female. Somehow, he is able to get inside characters who are completely different in background from himself, and make them believable. The action scenes in this book are riveting and violent without being gratuitous. The overall premise is timely and genuinely scary."
3,"Good story, some nice touches but not his best.","Definately a good read but sometimes the slang terms detracted from the story. I thought the characters could have been a little more realistic, especially in terms of dialect. Ever heard of trying TOO hard? Pretty fast paced, exciting but somewhat confusing story line, interesting plot. Not as good as some other of this author's books."
5,A wake up call for women--and men,"This is a book with a mischievous title and a very important, sensible message for women and men. It's all about empowerment; women need financial independence, and men (if they are enlightened) should be the first to support Evans' thoughtful message. Women lag way behind men when it comes to financial planning, and Evans offers numerous ways for them to get their fiscal house in order. It's a funny, shrewd and long-overdue book about a topic that (finally) is out in the open. And any men who gets hung up on the title needs to have his head examined. He's probably the kind of reader who thinks ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" is about hunting. Buy a copy for your loved one--and a friend!"
3,Not bad,The only reason I rate it this low it because its actually more of case studies rather than information about being here together again and why.
4,"Excellent, if slightly outdated, overview of CR","This collection of diverse essays provides a broad overview of the emerging field of conflict resolution. Although it has become a bit dated, only lightly covering many of the post-modern insights now popular in the field (gender, identity, and worldview conflicts), it's still a must-read for scholars and students interested in getting a broad introduction to CR."
5,clap,"Tascam has built in this everything needed for guitar enthusiasts who want to break down note by note to aquire otherwise hard to find notes as well as finger picking style.Now with this device one can quickly advance to playing such classic rock stars like steve howe from the group yes. I am not a sheet music reader but have a very good ear and yet could not keep up with such accomplished masterpieces such as the ""clap"" until now.Try finding any tabs online to play the ""clap""! NONE nodda! and now with this instrument, i can slow down and not only find the right notes but feel his finger style as well.This will make it easier for you to figure out tough songs period. Make sure you opt for a 9 volt adapter as this eats up regular batteries, rechargables batteries recommended. I highly recommend this for advanced musician"
2,Formulaic,"I suppose it should come as no surprise given how many novels she has written, but this one fell on the less interesting end of the spectrum."
4,This was a great work of fiction.,"I haven't been reading much fiction lately, but my mother talked me into this one that she had read from her book club. A ghostly story of sorts, which I love, I was immediately drawn into it. The main character is a man who is convinced he cannot die; he survived a car wreck that killed his true love and ever since then has been trying to reach ""the other side"". The plot takes so many twists and turns, you will not be able to put the book down, and you will be sad when it's done. The characters are very real and almost become your friends as you read. I would definitely recommend this book for some semi-light reading on a rainy weekend. :)"
3,A Little Confusin,"While I did enjoy this book by the end, I found it very confusing at times. There were so many characters. The author did not divide these characters sections very well so many times I had to go back and reread to figure out who was being talked about. I suggest this book only if you have a lot of time to dedicate to reading."
5,A great audio book!,"This is a ghost story, a love story, a history lesson, a telling account of the passion of motherhood, the tenacity of fatherhood, the connection of human life through many generations, the danger of stereotyping, an account of an obscure Native American tribe, and the common struggle of individual human beings in every generation living their daily lives and emerging triumphant!Jody Picoult is a master wordsmith and George Guidall the perfect narrator for this tale. I din't want it to end."
4,Like the contents; dislike paperbacks,"Jodi Picoult never disappoints; she is wonderful. I, however, prefer hardback books and do not place paperbacks on the shelf for a reread. So, this was donated to thrift shop after reading."
2,Second Glance,"I am a fan of Jodi Picoult books so when I started reading this I justexpected it would be so good, it's true she maintains her high qualityof writing but the theme of this story, plus the amount ofcharacters she introduces in a short period of time, madefor uncomfortable reading. Three times I tried to read ituntil I finally put it down as not my kind of book."
2,Second Glance,"For some reason, I did not connect with this novel. Not the Authors fault, butmine. Will try another time."
2,Disappointment,"I am an avid Jodi Picoult reader. This is the first of her's that did not have me staying up late to read more. In fact, this is the first of her's that took me more than a few days to read. Perhaps I would have enjoyed this book if I wasn't anticipating the fierce enjoyment I receive from every other Jodi Picoult novel. Basically I am just disappointed."
5,Amazing!,"This book, along with Picoult's others, has so many twists and turns, I had a hard time putting it down. The book was wonderfully written with so much historical and medical accuracy. It was well thought out, planned, and researched. Abosolutely loved it."
3,"Deducted 3 stars, then put one back","Took way too long to get into the story - - then (finally) you start to think, ""oh yeah, I see where she's goin now!"" Way too many different names for a lot of the characters, had to keep flipping back to see who was who. Picoult put a lot of thought into this book - it got interesting when all the events came together. Strange ending, but over all, a pretty good book."
4,"Worked well, but for a limited time","For a few months, it completely eliminated my RLS. However, it suddenly came back. Maybe it just got stronger and the Sedorum just wasn't enough anymore. I then tried Ropinirole, a prescription med, which did the trick, no side effects."
1,Boring and religious,"This book should not assume everyone is religious and warn you sooner than later. I was expecting a straightforward list of 40 date ideas, not a sermon. Religion aside, I was bored before I got that far.If you are Christian with plenty of time, this may be for you.If your time is valuable and/or your not Christian, a quick search on google will turn up better ideas for dates that most people can relate to."
2,Misleading Title...,"This is the first two-star review I've ever given but Amazon wants an honest review... With a title like ""40 Unforgettable Dates with Your Mate"" one might assume (as I did) that there would be a list of these 40 dates. I started reading the book and couldn't even finish it. Just wasn't what I expected and I did not care for the story book style. I'm glad this was a free book on Amazon and I didn't waste my money on it. I doubt I would look at any other titles by this couple/authors."
5,Best cart for art and craft shows,"For people who do outdoor shows, the four all-terrain wheels are invaluable. They make it a little bigger to get in a car, but both handles fold down and the length telescopes nicely. I carry heavy glass and steel art on my cart (this is the second one I have owned--the first was stolen when my studio was burglarized a month ago) and have used this cart for everything from tradeshows at convention centers (long hauls up ramps and through narrow aisles) to outdoor festivals in parks (tree roots, bumpy grass, holes and hills) and it safely carries as much as I can pull. In 20 years I have never seen another cart I liked better."
3,E is for...ELERHANT?,"I am giving this three stars because it has at least one typo. I pulled out a block with a picture of an elephant which was labeled ""elerhant."" I checked the others in the row and they were identical. I only bought these to use for a photo shoot so it's not a big deal to me, but I think parents and others buying this should be aware. Educational toys should not have errors."
3,Not what I thought,"These are a LOT smaller than I thought they would be. They are only about 1 inch by 1 inch. My son likes them, but quickly gets bored. Because they are so small, they are not very easy for a baby to stack and play with. The upside is that they are small enough that he can easily grab and hold them."
2,Way to small!,I thought these would be great for our 15 month old daughter but they were way to small. She couldn't stack them because they became lost in her hand!
3,put a dime sized hole in my foot when i stepped on one....,"My daughter, she loves these blocks. I have discovered that i hate these blocks. I was in the process of picking them up and stepped back over one, and it put a hole the size of a dime in my foot. So we've put them up till shes a bit older, I wish they were a bit bigger, but i can deal with the size, its the sharp edges that i dislike. So we love these blocks, in the closet where big people won't step on them, at least for another year i think. Oh, and my daughter got them for a first birthday present, and the size worked perfectly well with her."
2,"Garbage In, Garbage Out","This book speculates far more than good authors should do, especially dealing in the mind-boggling world of the serial killer. They are horribly wrong about the extent of Henry Lee Lucas' crimes (the numbers) and seem to know little about Ted Bundy that doesn't come from either Bob Keppel, Hugh Aynesworth or Stephen Michaud. Would love to see some original research."
4,Good solid weight lifting belt,If you do heavy weights then you are probably familiar with these types of belts. It works as intended soft and durable while being easy on the pocket compared to the local sellers prices.
1,Low quality product,"This belt is not a very well made product. It resembles cardboard more than leather. The belt guides are so thin you can stretch them with your fingers (not 1/4"" thick as shown in the photo of the tan belt). The front of the belt is supposed to be wide enough to give support for your abdominal muscles to push against, but is so small from top to bottom that you might as well wear a jeans belt. I ordered the Large length for my ""newly expanded"" 36"" waist but it's too long to even latch in the first set of holes. I bought the black version. Maybe the tan one is better quality. There is just no way anyone would give the belt I have 5 stars. To be fair; the buckle seems sturdy and the liner and padding look substantial. I'm not angry, just feeling duped. Again, if it's too good to be true...."
5,Valeo Leather Lifting Belt,"Works great. Bought this for my brother and he has no complaints. The medium sized belt should fit for someone around 5'6'' to 5'8'', and approximately 145 pounds."
2,Weightlifting belt,"Made out of plastic. Get what you pay for. Spend the extra money and get the leather. If you're a novice, it would be a good starter belt, just in case you don't stick with the sport. But, if you're more advanced, you really should invest in one of the higher quality belts. About the $100 range."
5,Good Belt,"Belt fits me well. I wear 34 size pants, so if you're in this range, then the Medium belt works well for you. I could probably use a small too, since I had to pull the belt through pretty far to get a tight fit. This really helps with my back, since I've learned my lesson after hurting it a few times too many while lifting."
2,Don't waste your time,"When I bought ""The Draco Tavern"" by Larry Niven it was rated ""4.5"" or ""5"" on Amazon reviews. I was disappointed; it seemed more like a ""1"" or ""2"". Larry Niven has written great short stories in the past, but these stories aren't worthy of his name."
4,Unusual mixes historical murder with current investigation,This was a most unusual book. Two murders have been committed in the same place. One during the reign of Richard 111 and one during the present day. Both are interlinked and the current investigation requires the understanding of the previous murder before it can be solved.
1,The whistle doesn't work - tried two different ones,"The whistle is defective. Don't purchase if you want a whistling teakettle. The first one stopped whistling after 3 weeks, the second after 2 days."
1,Not a Bosch caliber table saw,This Dewalt table saw has a very well engineered fence system. But so many other low grade features hurt this saw. The mitre guage is very cheap and bends easily. The blade is a throwaway - get a new one before you harm any valuable wood with this one. The saw is so loud my neighbors complain. Bosch is much higher quality for the money.
4,The perfect saw to grow out of!,"Pros: Dust collection, decent blade included, dead-on accurate out of the box, incredible fence, decent power.Cons: short distance between from of saw and blade, should have used T-Slots to compensate.But, you've heard all that. If you want to know whether this saw is a good choice for the cramped space, first saw buyer I can say decisively that it is because that is the situation I am in and I actually own the saw. Buy it. If you upgrade later to a cabinet or contractors saw you will still have a great portable saw for taking to the in-laws. Or, a second saw to keep the dado stack in."
3,Product totally froze just after one year passed,"The DeWalt Portable Table Saw I purchased last year worked great with little problems until the one year mark. At that time, the brushes needed replacing. Within one month of that event all bushings in the motor froze rendering the table saw completely inoperable.Since it was 2 months passed the end of the warranty period, we are now without a table saw and must purchase a new one. My advice would be if a person is in construction and will be using this saw for business purposes it would be wise to consider another brand, unless you plan to replace your table saw each year or can afford the down time."
1,Run the Other Direction,"The directions are complete and easy to understand. However despite the directions, which include turning this saw upside down and adjusting the rack and pinion adjustment, this table saw just does not measure up. The gears on the rack and pinion fence adjustment continually skip especially as the fence extends out to the its maximum rip length of 24 inches. The mechanics of this feature were just plain shoddy. DeWalt Customer support was equally unimpressive. Like the title says, I recommend running in the other direction on this one. Fair warning friends."
3,Good Saw,This is a well built quality saw. Good 120 volt performance. Decent blade for general usage. A saw with a very good fence and decent mitre. I would buy one again.
2,Thin & Flimsy Optical Digital Cable,"The picture does not represent the product the vendor sends. The picture looks like the heavier duty Opticla cables that are made by Belkin, Monster, and some other companies. What you get is a thin about 1/8"" OD cable. It works, but it does not Click firmly into Optical Digital sockets and is not likely to withstand much stress over time. You get what you pay for. If you want better, I'd suggest the Belkin cable."
4,does what it is supposed to,Does exactly what mederma is supposed to do. Put it in as required and you are good to go. Nice product
3,Not sure if its working,"Been using it for 4 months and I don't really see a difference. I've been putting it on faithfully every day since September (it's late January now) and while one scar might not be as bumpy as it was, after 4 months there should be more of a difference so I don't think I'm going to get another tube when this runs out. I'd actually give this 2 1/2 stars. I wouldn't say outright that I don't like it, but its not the miracle it claims to be."
4,Seems to be doing what it's supposed to.,I have a sugery scar from a year ago. I had been looking around for good scar fading prouct and came across Mederma. The instructions say that I need to use it 3 times a day for 3 or 4 months to see full benefits. It has been almost a month and my scar does seem to be a bit lighter.Will post another review in 3 months.
4,"So far, so good...","I haven't tested the water coming out of the shower head...but I noticed that there isn't any sulfer-smelling water coming out of the shower like there is from my bathroom sink. If I could filter the whole house...I would be in heaven. But alas...I am renting. (sigh)Very easy to install. Might need a good wrench the first time. It leaks a very little, but we try to take short showers. I know you can add some tape to seal it.Price is really reasonable compared to others on the market. I'd recommend this to everyone who wants to stay away from toxic chlorine. You'd be surprised what chlorine and its fumes can do to your endocrine system. Just Google it."
2,Works great... for about 2 months.,"This shower filter was decently priced so we tried it out. This was the second shower head we tried out after Culligan's which was pointless. We had it for about two months when I started to notice my hair becoming stickier and stickier when towel-dried. It claims to last for a year so we didn't think much of it. I thought perhaps it was my shampoo or conditioner so I went out and bought new ones... still sticky. I then ordered a replacement filter for the same unit and low and behold, my hair was back to normal. It has now been almost 3 months since the replacement was installed and my hair is sticky once again. This is becoming expensive, to have to replace the filter every 2-3months. It works great when new, and I could understand if it lasted 6 months plus when the claim is really 12 months... but 2-3 months?!"
5,I'm your customer for life.,"In my area the tap water contains so much chlorine that it stinks. This product completely eliminated the smell, and water is soft like silk. I'm your customer for life."
4,works fairly well,"We have city water that is treated with chlorine. With this filter, I only faintly smell the chlorine during a shower. When I fill the tub through it, I still definitely smell the chlorine, but it is no longer a strong smell.Hoping enough is removed to make it safe. Certainly it is better than not using it.We installed a hand shower after this filter. The filter is pretty sturdy, so I'm hoping it will continue to hold the weight of the hand shower without incident.Cannot compare it to others as we have no other experience.UPDATE:Got a Berkey KDF filter, and although it cost almost twice as much, it removed the chlorine smell completely in early months. 8 months later I'm smelling about as much chlorine smell with Berkey as I did with this Sprite when it was new.We will be buying another Berkey."
2,No noticable difference in my water,"I can't tell if this is working or not. I haven't noticed a change in my water, my hair or skin since using this filter."
3,As Expected,"I had one of these years ago. This one is the same, a little bit better filter cartridge. The water feels different, and does not smell so strong of chlorine, So that is a plus."
2,Not very ADD friendly,"This book has some very good information about ADD. I don't think it was actually written for a person with ADD to read. For somebody who claims to know so much about ADD, he does not know how to write a book that a person with ADD to actually read through.It may be full of great information but seems very hard for the average ADDer reader to stay focussed on.The author has very negative view on ADD. There was not any mention of the positve aspects of ADD like Thom Hartman and Lynn Weiss have in their books. I was disapointed by this book.There was very little mention of ADD with out hyperactivity or innatentive ADD.There was very little mention of ways to manage ADD other than medication."
4,bike rack,Good basic bike rack. Very well built and easy to set up. Comfortably holds our family's four bikes.
5,Great Rack,Great rack. It's easy to put on the car and easy to load and unload bikes. Very solid and great for the price. Arrived in two days.
4,Decent rack at a reasonable price,"Not too much to say about it, does what it's supposed to. It would be nice if the two bars that hold up the bike would fold down though."
4,would like to see a normal hitch pin,"Nice product, good finish, heavy enough to use regularly, but installation requires bolting it onto the hitch receiver with a 3/4 inch bolt. This means you have to carry a large crescent or box wrench if you want to drop the unit on either end of the trip. In order to secure the unit, you need to purchase their lock or use a cable lock. I would have given it a ""5"" if I could have used my own locking hitch pin to install and secure the rack. As-is, I will probably mill the welded nut out of the hitch insert and use my own hitch pin."
4,Great intro to Van Gogh for little ones,"This book has made our 2-year-old a fan of Van Gogh, to the point that she now insists on making her crayon skies with swirls of blue instead of straight lines. Very nice introduction to the artist and a few of his best-known works, with a child-pleasing narrative. An adult, however, will get very tired of the extremely simple story after reading it to an eager pre-schooler for the zillionth time."
5,Brilliant,"I think this story demonstrates a very sensitive handling of a small part of the story of Vincent van Gogh, in terms which a child would find very easy to understand. My only worry is that when my children are old enough for me to read it to them, I will have trouble choking back the tears."
2,Does this toy stack up?,Although the toy is durable and very colorful the wonderful soft construction is actually a drawback .Very young children may have trouble moving the fabric against fabric to slide the rings on-w3hich is the whole purpose. The tried and true plastic version may be a better buy.
2,Plastic version is better,"To my dismay, my nephew preferred the plastic version, which he can chew and take in the bath. The pretty designs have more appeal to adults. My high durability rating is based on the dog's use rather than the baby's use! If you want to spend money on a Lamaze toy, I suggest you pick another one."
3,Why does everyone turn out to be gay???????,"I've read (and enjoyed) all of Mr. Harris' books but after this one I was annoyed. Why does everyone ALWAYS turn out to be gay??? It would have been so refreshing if Zurich had been straight. Instead, Mr. Harris went for the obvious choice and confirmed my belief that instead of just writing entertaining, thought provoking novels from a gay man's point of view, he forcing his ""they're more gay men out there than you think"" message down our throats. Well, I think this may be my last E. Lynn Harris adventure."
5,THIS BOOK IS A TOTAL WAKE-UP CALL!!,"THIS BOOK GIVES YOU A LOOK INSIDE THE OTHER WORLD. THIS IS A WORLD THAT MOST PEOPLE TRY TO BLOCK OUT OF THEIR LIVES. BY READING BOOKS LIKE THE ONES E. LYNN HARRIS WROTE, A PERSON MAY RECIEVE AN EMOTINAL AND SPIRITUAL BLESSING."
3,The Sisterhood Journey Bookclub Review,"This novel brought about a lively discussion as issues ranged from Gay Rights to Gays vs. Religion and family, from facing fears, to Male Dominance to Hetero-Sexual cultivation plus more. This book, which started off a little dry for most of us, was full of surprises and twists, not to mention love and romance. We voted this Novel as recommendable (2.5)."
4,A MUST READ,"This book was not at all what I expected. Even though the bases of the book was not about the football player being acused of a crime he didn't commit, it was very interesting. I read the book right before my best friend ""came out of the closet"" so it really gave me some insight on homosexuality, and gave me the strength to support my friend; which I would have anyway. This was a very good novel and I highly recommend this to anyone."
1,Zero stars would be more like it.,"This product isn't any better than version 3.0 for Windows 3.1. In fact, the only big differences between the two products are that this one is more bloated and more buggy. It's too expensive for what it is, and they should really be paying me for using this piece of garbage.There's a title for Microsoft Works 7.0 users, and that title is ""beta tester."""
3,Solid Album from old Friend,"I was surprised to see only one review for this album. After all, it is from Def Jam, one of the most popular record labels.I have about 100 cd's, and i would have to say that this would be in the top 10-15.Although you're not going to get any worly insight on ths album, it will give you some great beats to bump in the ride. It's classic Sermon. The best two songs on the disc are Don't Get Gased, and the surprisingly mellow (for Sermon) Can't Stop. Other Highlights are Focus (with two of my favorites Xzibit and Quik)and So Sweet. Rick the Rulers verse on Why Not? is also solid. Suprisingly its the guest artists (Redman who's only tight on his stuff and a garbage guest MC, Shy Scott, Too Short) that really slip up on this album. Combine that with the fact that Erick is only an average rapper, and you could have disaster. Fortunally, Erick and his beats are in the best form they've been in in years, and this makes for a pretty good album"
5,He's done it again!,"After relishing the old standards on ""Standard Time"" (I'm a sucker for the big band sound), now I'm soooo enjoying ""Always"", with its NEW standards. These are songs I grew up with. Sam brings a new dimension to this music with his slightly breathy, maturing voice. Highly recommended!David Forcey"
5,A Practical Guide To Printing,As a person who has recently opened a Print Shop Museum - but knows very little about the process this book is invaluable. It came on time and is in good condition.I am pleased.
3,Frustrating and difficult for my son,"I got this for Christmas for my son who is 4.5 based on the reviews on amazon, but the product was harder than I expected it to be. Make sure you know how to do it before showing your child or they may get very frustrated like my son did. His fine motor skills are not great and I thought this hands on toy may encourage him to use his hands and build those fine motor skills, but he told me to put the toy away. he was really mad, and he also saw on the box where it says 3+ and this made him even more upset because he couldn't put the pieces together at 4.5 years old. I recommend the Kid K'nex instead of this."
5,Great for family time!!!!!!,We first played with this at a friends home. We came home and ordered it that night. This is excellent for my children to play with Daddy and learn at the same time.
1,Does not work,"The adapter does not work when connecting it from my old macbook pro DVI port to hdmi cable to samsung LED tv/monitor. My computer does not even register it... The DVI to VGA adapter (Apple) works, so it's not my DVI port. It could be just that the macbook pro is not recognizing the hdmi cable/monitor though...??"
1,Didn't work for me,"Maybe it's somewhere in the fine print and I missed it, but this adapter didn't work for our purposes. We were trying to go from the DVI port on a G4 Powerbook to our HDMI projector but the projector would never recognize the signal.As far as the one star rating, Amazon doesn't let you comment unless you rate the product. I don't know if I hate it, and it may work fine for you, it just didn't work for me, for my particular application. For all I know, I'm the only one still using a G4 MacBook...but just in case."
1,*DOES NOT DO AUDIO OUTPUT!*,"I read someone elses review on here where they said they got the audio to output as well. I purchased based on that review, and that is incorrect. I was unable to get the audio to work correct (yes, I have SPDIF_OUT running to My GeForce 9800 GTX+) and it didn't work.The picture quality looks fantastic though."
2,What's a DVI-M mean?,I needed an adapter to connect my DVI output on my 560TI video card to my Samsung's HDMI port. So far it doesn't work right.
1,Not Working,"it dose not work at all, i went to bestbuy and bought Rockfish brand of same thing and it works fine.even its cheap but never try it"
1,Defective Garbage! Adapters do not work!,These adapters are defective and poor quality. They do not work at all. Do not buy these cables. We purchased a bulk order and all are defective.
1,"doesnt work, no way","trying to connect an old DVI macbook with a samsung lcd 32"" to mirror my desktopno lucki dont have other DVI sources to double check the adapter, so i cant say if the problems reside on my mac or not. My HDMI cable works well.I heard strange rumors about DVI mac connections: seems that some lcd screens have a 768 hd resolution and not 720 like they should. This difference create a conflict between laptop and tv and the result is a black screen.Maybe is true, maybe not, i dont know...I have a newer macbook laptop with a little hdmi out connection: it works with my tvanyway, i bought the adapter to connect my old laptop to tv but it doesnt works.."
1,Exaggerated claims as information source,"The title of this book and the description of it use adjectives such as ""unrivaled"" and ""unprecedented"" and ""illustrated"". I found all of this to be simply hyperbole; a gross overstatement of the value of this tome. There is nothing new in it and there are pity few pictures of uniforms; virtually all of the illustrations look to me to be reprints of those found in various Osprey books. It's fine as a primer, but not as a painting guide for hobbyists."
5,A wonderful author,"Janice Weber's books always make me cry, ""More! More!"" Eva Hathaway had me in stitches, and Frost did much the same."
2,Mom said it was too hard,Got it for my mom to help with acid reflux at night. She couldn't sleep on it; said it was too hard. I may get it back from her to see if I can use it for watching tv in bed.Did get fast delivery.
3,"7"" wedge pillow","I purchased the 7"" wedge after trying the 12"" wedge pillow. These pillows are firm foam, and very nice. I am able to put pillows on this wedge and make it softer, but also gives me the incline I need. Helps with my breathing and snoring problems."
3,"Good, but caused back ache","This is a comfortable wedge pillow for acid reflux problems. It definitely needs a pillow at the very top though, otherwise you will get a neck ache. After using it for two weeks, I got a slight back ache. Overall though, it is firm enough and works well."
3,He loves his wedge,This was a Christmas gift for my boyfriend and he loves it. It wasn't exactly what I envisioned but mission accomplished.
5,inexpensive alternative,"I bought this not for acid reflux, but as an alternative to Liberator Wedge, Blue. My girlfriend and I wanted to try something new and we enjoyed the experience enough to add it to our mix. The foam is stiff enough to provide just the right amount of lift, and it worked much better than using pillows. The cover is washable, but it is made of thin cotton, and the zipper doesn't look very durable so I will probably invest in the other product when I can afford to. So if you are on a tight budget or you want to try before you buy, this works nicely."
1,A Real Bummer,"Hiking the AT is long, arduous, and trying experience, and so is reading this book. I make it a point to finish every book I start, but the first 26 pages of detailed, creepy episodes with one of her ex-boyfriends almost stopped me there. Then when she gets to the trail, it is continuous complaining. Everyone on the trail complains--its only natural--but Ms. Winters makes a point of doing it. There are few people in the book with whom she doesn't have a problem. Like Bill Bryson, she doesn't finish the trail either, but at least Bryson was entertaining, even when he complained.The only bright spot I found in this book was Winters' knowledge of plants. She seems to have a great appreciation for the outdoors, but that gets pushed aside for her copious physical and mental agonies. If you are a woman seeking another's account of the trail, try Adrienne Hall, Jean Deeds, or somebody else. Even better, try Earl Shaffer's Walking With Spring, the best account of all."
5,Somebody messed up!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"On page 57, on the third to the last paragraph, It says ""On a yacht, huh?"" Rachel mused. Rachel is telling the story! Why does she say Rachel? Guess We'll never know, Huh."
4,annimorphs the reaction,"Rachael got some pretty stuff happening.She can't control her morphing.(rachael is an animorph,any animal she touches she turns into.)one minute she would be listening to music and the next she's morphing into a full grown crocidile!No one is sure,but rachael and the others have to find out quick whats happening before any one catches her oyt of control or else they're in serious trouble!"
2,A dissapointment,This is the worst book in the series. It didn'n have a plot and it totaly didn't fit in with the rest of the books. It doesn't have much to do with the Yeerk invasion. I think K.A Applegate doesn't know what to write anymore allthough they say #14 is pretty good.
2,Adorable but leaky after a few months,"My daughter LOVES these cups because of the Minnie Mouse design and my husband loves these cups because the ease of use (no parts to put together), but I can't stand them anymore. After a couple months of use all 6 of the cups we own leak. My daughter is 17 months old and tends to leave her cups on their sides on the floor. I have found many a cup with a puddle under them. The problem with our cups is that the built-in valves no longer ""close"" or touch, so the liquid easily drips out. Though ""dishwasher safe"", I wonder if the dishwasher played a part in ruining the valves. I wouldn't recommend these for long-term use."
1,Both cups leak!!! Waste of money.,"I bought a pair of these FY cups hoping that this will be the last one i have to buy for my toddler. Another waste of money. I am so frustrated!! Tried both cups and they both leak when they are laid on side as toddlers do, so basically this is totally useless. I read great reviews of Gerber's sippy cups that don't leak, so I just bought them and hopefully it will be the last time. Big big disappointment. All I want is just a sippy cup that doesn't leak!!"
4,"Great cups, but a bit of effort is needed.","My son loves Cars and these cups. After wearing out the pictures on his first set, we decided to get some more. The only issue we have ever had with the cups is ""working in"" the valves. We have found that using a meat thermometer does the job quite well of loosening the valves just enough so my son get drink from the cup.After needing to buy replacements, the lesson we learned is to not wash the cups in the dishwasher. A little extra effort will allow these cups to last much longer."
2,Spout to big for a small mouth,"We have a 2 year old little boy who loves Mickey Mouse, so I couldn't wait to get these cups in for him! The cups are really cute, but if your child has a small mouth it is really hard to get a drink. Our son loved the fact that it was a Mickey Mouse cup, but told us it hurt his mouth!"
5,Love these cups,"As parents of 3 little ones, we have tried many different sippy cups. I happened to be at a warehouse sale and bought a few packages basically because I couldn't pass up the price. I wish I had grabbed the entire box. These cups truly do not leak. It took the kids a few minutes to get use to the new spout and get their drinks out, but now they have no problems. Best of all I no longer have stains and wet spots all over my house. I highly recommend this item to anyone with small children"
3,great cups but not as shown,"The cups that came look nothing like the photo. They are Mickey. Normally, would not be a big deal but son will only drink out of the blue cup. Therefore, the cups that came are not helpful."
1,Don't even bother! Buy Playtex Sippy cups instead.,"I have to honestly say that this has to be the worst sippy cup I have ever purchased! It leaks from the moment I put the cover on, all over my daughter, and all over the furniture. I purchased the cups because of the Minnie Mouse design, but I will never again skimp on quality for cuteness. I am going to stick to the Playtex sippy cups which have never given me a problem. I hope that if you are considering these cups you'd look at the Playtex ones instead and make a smart purchase. Hope this review was helpful to you!TRUST ME ON THIS:Playtex Insulator Cup 9 oz. - 1pk."
4,No leaks,no leaks! These cups were a little difficult for my 3 year old to drink from - he felt like he needed to suck too hard to get the water out. But it was perfect to keep the two year old from spilling
1,"Received different model, not the one in the picture","What's the point of offering a product WITH a picture, if the item actually being sold is a different one? The reason I took the time to go on-line and buy this product for my son at Amazon and WAIT for it, was because the Cars version they have at my local Target (or any store for that matter) is one I had already purchased. I wanted a different one, and this one looked pretty nice, nice colors. BUT, I received the one I ALREADY had, which is dull, maroon and grey... Very disappointed."
5,Best Sippy Ever!!!,"My daughter's father brought her home with one of these. After a day of using this cup I went out and bought 6 more. I have been using these cups for about 4 months now and these are the only sippy's I will buy or let her use. I had been through every sippy cup I saw in the store and nothing is better than this cup. I took all the other sippy cups she had and boxed them away. I have never had this cup leak, not once. If you are looking for a truly leak proof sippy cup, this is what you are looking for."
1,Could I get a SIP out of this SIPPY CUP please??,"Everything looked great on this cup- liked the look of it, looked easy to clean- but when we tried out the cup before we gave it to our 11 month old- you can't get a DROP out of it. The holes are like a pin hole. So I took a knife to the plastic and widened their awesome patented easy-to clean built in valve so that my child could actually take a SIP from this stupid SIPPY CUP. So, may I ask... what's the point of buying a sippy cup if you can't even get a SIP out of it? So ridiculous- so now I have a sippy cup that works because I widened the holes myself...but leaks like crazy! lol! I think the playtex are the best. They are cute cups, and the idea behind it would be great- if it worked. Glad I tried it before I gave it to my child...he would've been very, very angry!"
5,"Works well, easy to clean","Great, leakproof sippy cup. MUCH easier to clean than valve-based varieties. I highly recommend this one for home AND out & about. My friend told me about this brand and I'm so glad we listened to her. We have 2 young kids and we have tried many other brands of sippy in the past, but this is the best, and now this is the only brand of sippy we purchase. You will need to use a nipple brush to clean the inside of the spout (but it IS easy to clean) - so don't throw out your baby bottle brush & nipple brush just because your baby has graduated to a sippy!On the downside, I find that after about 6 months to a year of daily use, the sippy cup will eventually start to leak a little in one of the top valves. So you will need to eventually replace the old sippy cup. But it is leakproof for quite a long time and in that regard is waaay better than any of the other brands we have tried."
2,"tick, tick, tick","One dimensional kungfu flick, with no out of the ordinary scenes that will impress. It is no different from the cheap fighting flicks that you would randomly select at your local video rental. Wouldn't recommend it to anyone."
2,A serious study of the fashion world,"Reader beware: if you buy this book expecting to find a fun, entertaining read about clothes, you'll be disappointed. However, if what you want is a book that provides insight into how fashion is a business, and the factors that influence the success of that business, then this may be the book for you. Another caution: although the print date is listed as 1999, the articles and examples were written much earlier."
2,Great Explanation of EMDR,"This book is not particularly useful for clinicians. Laypeople who want a clear overview of EMDR will find it in this book by the ""discoverer"" of the techniques."
5,A Breakthrough in Persistent Psychological Blocks,"I participated in a test volunteer group for people who wanted to experience EMDR for clinical studies. While I have not been in a combat situation or survived serious life threatening episodes, we were asked to choose a lingering event that caused enough upset and persisted through time. Most of us selected something that we didn't have much luck releasing on our own. So, when EMDR was administered on these memories many of us, including myself, reported relief. I still had the memory of an upsetting event but no longer had the emotions. It was like seeing a movie and having no reactions to it. The EMDR took about 2 or 3 sessions at most and researchers concluded its effectiveness."
1,"i'd give it zero, if i could","i have a corded iron i hate, because it has one temperature--hot. but it still can't handle linen.i read the reviews on this item carefully. i would love to know what these people are ironing.i used this iron on a length of muslin. simple, 100% cotton cloth, light weight. the iron spent more time re-heating in the cradle than it did on the fabric. if i used the spray button too often, the iron dribbled, badly. the steam button produced nothing at all. i realized i was pressing so hard that my shoulder hurt. and i still had wrinkles. i finally used the despised corded iron.i intended to use this iron on my cutting board, which has a pressing cloth sized to it. it would have been perfect for ironing lengths of cloth for piecing and quilting--except that it can't handle muslin.a complete waste of money."
2,The Bread and puppet Theater,"Erst your writings for ""the bread anf puppet theater "" express one's thanks.I investigating about puppet for Richard Schumann.I search connection of puppet, and i take pleasure in your book.I am interesting, very curious to know.Can you me a chance read this books ?I have a hope instantly your an answer.vielen Dank!"
1,Badlands ... Bad start,"Susan Wright does an affable job telling us NO story, only postulating events that lead up to what Book 2 promises to be a thrilling conclusion. Book 1 proposes a mysterious threat located in the area of outer space known as the Badlands ... and that's about it. With part of the story told in the Star Trek TOS timeframe and then another part in Star Trek TNG, that's all we're given ... no memorable characters and almost laughably forgettable dialogue. Many scenes almost read like filler, written last minute to expand the book to a required word length. It's curious how this story, out of the multitude of ideas that are probably submitted to Pocket Books, made it past the editorial staff. The only positive assessment I can add is that it was a quick read."
3,Did anyone catch that blurb?,"""Mysterious force?"" ""Phantom menace?"" Does this sound familiar to anyone else?"
3,Not a too good one...,"Personally I dislike(maybe hate??) this book: Its been like a nightmare to understand it entirely, mainly for its complicated use of the Spanish language.Eventhough, i gotta admit its the one that has the most comprehensive content, and... the most important ""pro"", its the basic anatomy book at my Medicine School(Leon, GTO, MEX)!!(i got no options)"
5,Great product!,"I need to have a pen on hand at times and hated to carry a pen in my pocket. This handy stylus is perfect for carrying with my Treo 700W Smartphone/PDA. I have found it to be the perfect companion - a stylus for the PDA, but pull of the cap and you can jot down a few notes quickly or sign a paper without hunting for a pen."
5,Amazing,"This has been one of the first books I've read in quite some time where I actually related to the character.She has a sense of humor, great fun yet also believable with that ability to make fun of herself.Great book and a fun story, the pages just fly by."
1,Extremely Disappointed,"[...]The book was terrible, lacked substance, reality, and was way too long. By page 200 I was about to pull my hair out.Emily Briggs lives in the city and has a male for a best friend of whom she is clearly jealous. Around that time she meets Henry, a starving artist and likes him. Their whirlwind courtship is way too easy.What I didn't like was Emily's personality was so boring. The romantic subplot had no substance either and no anticipation. [...] The worst thing about the book is that there were tons of grammatical errors. [...] But it's horrible and frankly I'm disappointed enough to never purchase another Strapless book again."
4,one of paretsky's better storiew,"although i am not a big v.i. warshawski fan i found this story better then most of the previous books. v.i. can be over bearing to the point of unbelievable, in this she was a little more believable. definitly worth reading"
2,Too Hard to Believe,"I've read every Paretsky / Warshawski book but the last (as we speak), but I'm disappointed at the pretty unbelievable action in this one. I often feel like our author and our leading lady have the same problem as Robin Cook sometimes -- when the characters start moving around and breaking into places and being mugged, being tailed, etc. etc., it just gets a little tough to believe. I believe if V.I. stayed put a little more and did a little more cerebral work and a little less hotdogging 'round Chicago, we'd both be happer.I'm still a fan, but I'd rather see fewer and more well developed characters, a somewhat less complicated yet compelling plot, and surely less social commentary. Letting some reasonable actions speak for themselves is better than rubbing our faces in it. Would like to see Paretsky stop reading Grisham and get back to her earlier self!"
3,Tunnel Vision,"I read all the Paretsky mysteries as a habit, but these later ones are awfully long, and V. I.'s getting muddier and muddier as she crawls through uglier parts of the city. I do not enjoy this."
4,"Interesting Content, Pitiful Editing","I've been in the IT field for 20 years, and have read a smallish number of books on IT organization, strategy, etc. I enjoyed this book, but it was seriously marred by some of the worst editing I've ever seen. I counted more than 10 typographical & context errors.And those errors left me wondering if there were other context errors in the non-IT portions of the text that I missed simply because I'm heavily weighted towards the IT side of business.The editing mistakes not-withstanding, I do recommend this book. It's chock-full of simple advice that I wish my company would take. Things like ""If you support Oracle, IBM, Microsoft and other large database platforms, you're insane ..."""
1,This house review,"Received the house in perfect condition and now have it hanging on my balcony waiting for the new owners to move in.I like that it doesn't have a peg sticking out from below the entrance hole, this prevents predator birds perching andhaving a chance to see what potential dinner is inside.Unfortunately, the whole thing is securely nailed together, I cannot find anyway to remove the base as mentioned in the descriptionabove. This means it is likely a 'one-use' bird home, as once the chicks are born, the birds will abandon the nest, leaving mewith a bird house full of 'old furniture' which new owners will not find attractve."
4,A ground-breaker and genre classic,"Harold is a parody featuring then-young Charlie Hill, the Oneida comic. Acting is stilted and the story is cheesy, but it gets to core issues in American Indian views of self and their relations to non-Indians. Based on a screenplay by Gerald Vizenor, a Native American scholar, poet, and novelist, the story follows a the ""Warriors of Orange"" who are out to scam a foundation for some funding for a second time. There is certainly ""inside"" humor, but even if you don't get every joke, you'll have a good half-hour of fun."
4,A convenient compilation for collectors,"This compilation contains B-sides from the Uh Huh Her singles. Once again, PJ Harvey's record label has released an extensive array of material beyond the basic album. Island clearly believes that a lot of PJ Harvey fans are collectors and completists.Track list:1. The Falling2. The Phone Song3. Bows & Arrows4. Angel5. Stone6. Who The F*** (4-track demo)If you are having difficulty in tracking down the singles (or you have no interest in doing so), ""B-Sides"" is a good way to get these songs all in one fell swoop. Plus the cover shows Polly wearing some funny knickers, yowsa!"
5,Great Stuff!,This book is great. Any questions that you may have about music in general are often answered in this book. It's a manual that all musicians should own. Buy it!
3,too many typo,steps are not very clear for an introductory bookand there are too many typos in the first edition
3,Buy Microsoft Money Deluxe instead,"I was going to purchase the Microsoft Money Standard because it's free after the TaxCut rebate, but I discovered that with the promotional rebates being offered by Amazon.com (expires 2/28/2003) and Microsoft, the Deluxe version of Microsoft Money is less than the Taxcut rebate amount. So make the most of all those rebates and purchase the Deluxe version instead!"
2,I would have liked to have seen more dreams in this book,"I thought this book would have more dreams interpreted in it. The book is laid out nicely, but I was dissappointed."
4,Your Life Is Worth It!,I just completed an AMGA Course and I have to say this is one of the finest consolidations of safe climbing advice that I've seen to date. The suggestions are simple to follow and make you wonder 'Why didn't I think of that?' I've been a traditonal lead climber several years now and I can honestly say I'll be implementing some of the authors safety pointers the next time I'm on the rock.
1,Don't order this product using Amazon Prime.,"The product is fine. I am using this forum to share my experience with Amazon Prime in such a way as to get some action from Amazon (More rational attempts have been futile) and to warn others of a problem with their program. I have bought quite a bit on Amazon and untill reciently, have been happy. However, although I pay nearly eighty dollars per year for second day delivery to my home, the last half dozen packages have ended up at my post office box with postage due on every one. My attempts to get an answer besides ""sorry"" haven't produced much so far. Beware Amazon Prime."
2,Presentation quality,"I chose this text in preparation for an assignment given. Discounting the era in which the content was written, the e-pages were disconcerting. Different fonts on a single page. Unnecessary breaks in sentence construction caused no little confusion for where a thought/subject began /ended. Long run-on sentences, poor punctuation are just a few of the poor quality."
4,click on,"this DVD has 4 great songs;Daddu Cool, Sunny, Rasputin, Children of Paradise but you have to click on each song. It is good DVD just to short. NTSC-signal beautiful color on Rasputin"
5,Mesmerizing and Atmospheric,"Magnificent. There should be more than five stars available for a book as well done as this.I am amazed that anyone could read CROWN IN CANDLELIGHT and not give it the five stars available. The characters spring to life, fully realized, and with very different voices, and the writing is mesmerizing and atmospheric. Plus, unlike so much other modern writing in the field, it is historically accurate.The love scenes are romantic and an object lesson in how such scenes should be written, instead of the embarrassing overly clinical crud of ""what goes where"" that has me fast forwarding through so much modern historical fiction.I cannot imagine any other author bothering to try to write about Katherine d' Valois and Owen Tudor. It has been done, and done magnificently, by Jarman."
4,Good if you are interested in the subject or have daughters,"I read this book and found it to be very insightful in to the lives of kids/teens today, but it did seem to be the same kind of thing over and over. Girls bully in a different way that guys. Maybe it seemed to be too much of the same thing for me because I am a female and I went through it all in school when I was little so I already knew what was going to be discussed. However, I still think it is a good book to read and there are some differences in how much social pressure girls are faced with now compared to 15-20 years ago when I was in elementary-middle school."
5,Absolutely Ground-Breaking!! A must read for all women!!,"This book is filled with stories and life lessons that all women can learn from. Starting from the first pages, you will relate to the stories told. This book will change your perceptions and the way you relate to other women in your life. Do yourself a favor, buy this book. Buy a copy for those you love (and maybe those you don't necessarily like, too). If you want to have an emotional healing, start with this book. It's a journey of emotional, defining moments in our lives and how those moments have affected who we are. It's absolutely engaging."
2,The size is smaller than expected,"I have been using another brand of elbow support (small). I found the OTC PulloverElastic Elbow Sleeve (Small) from amazon.com and think the size (Fits elbow8.5-10.0 in) would be OK for an elbow of 9 in. However, after having usedseveral days, I found it is too small and too tight. Continually wearing it makesme not comfortable. This is not as good as the ones of other brand."
5,A Must Read,This is just a wonderful guide and insight as to how marriages should be conducted. So glad I read it now that I am a newlywed instead of years from now.
5,THE manual on marriage,"Marriage on the Rock is a life-changing book. Encouraging and informative, it ignites hope and shows the way to build a solid marriage no matter what condition you're in. If you want your marriage to improve from good to great, or you're desperate for answers to heal the brokenness, this book is a must-read!"
5,Wedding Songs,"Absolutely love this CD. I would recommend to all who need some personal songs like the song = A song for my son , ect.Recd in no time. Fast and item was as indicated. Would purchase from again."
4,Graphic SF Reader,"Hard to go wrong with JR Jr. A small dose of Spider-Man now again is not too bad. The problem I have with this is the style, it leans towards the MacFarlane end of crazy bendy Spider-Man, as opposed to his work on X-Men. I hated that stuff then, and I still don't like it a lot now, but Romita is good enough to pull it off and not annoy me as much."
4,Dog Bible: Indespensible,"This book does truly have answers to practically every conceivable question you could have about your dog. It has been a great help for us. We have two dogs, love both dearly, and so this book helps alleviate a lot of concern that we might have about what to do for or with our dogs under every circumstance immaginable. It is an indespensible tool for the dog lover/owner!"
1,Uneven at best,"I find Mary Jo Putney's book usually either hit or miss. This book, while it had some potential with the mismatched couples, faultered because of inspid characters. The match between Caroline and Jason would have bored him to tears. Why would he have even pursued it. It's silly to think that Jason would have married such a spineless creature as Caroline over horses. Richard was a pretty boring guy so he and Caroline went well as they were both boring. It was a hard book to finish because who cared in the end who ended up with whom."
4,refreshingly original,"I grabbed a copy of The Lucky Ones on impulse, and I'm glad I did. It drew me in from the start and I enjoyed the ups and downs of the stories, the varied moods, and the authentic feel of the stories within. I particularly enjoyed Cusk's grasp of extremely different views and backgrounds among her characters. She seems to have a tremendous ""feel"" for human nature which makes all of the stories feel rich and alive. It also had a nice balance of light and dark, there was beauty in every story and a little bit of the darker side of life as well. It made me want to explore more of Cusk's work in the future."
2,Needs more work,"I'm still trying to finish this book, desperately hoping it gets better. An avid reader of many fiction and non-fiction genres, I very rarely give up on a book entirely. However, I am 100+ pages into this one and still have no feeling for any of the characters.The cumbersome cast of extended family members breeze in and out of the text, neither adding to the storyline nor developing their characters. While the main character's internal thoughts and reflections read fairly well, conversations between characters feel aimless and meandering. This may be attributable to the author's inexperience.I am a big fan of this and similar genres. I want to like this book, but it has not impressed me yet."
1,It's like a ball and chain,"Whatever you do, spend the extra $100 and get a double pump. I had the pump in style with my first and only used it for a few months(but I really liked it) so I thought I would spend less on this one and just dedicate the extra time to pumping while I'm home. BIG MISTAKE!! First off it takes forever to pump, and then you still have to do the other breast. Because it's such a weak pump, I get really engorged and when I'm pumping, the milk somehow goes into the tube and makes a huge mess and I have to take it off, clean it and start all over. It's honestly like a ball and chain. I have NO time to do anything else, including enjoying my newborn child. Just a complete waste of money. I regret this buy."
3,Clean up hassle,I started pumping in earnest everyday for since January when i returned to work. The pump works well however the condensation in the tube which sounded like an exception in the instructions happened from the first and every pumping session since and it is a real hassle to dry out. i dont even bother to try to dry it anymore. And milk gets sucked into the tube occasionally for no reason. That is a real hassle to clean and it wets the battery compartment. Those are design flaws Medela should work on. Other than that it pumps fast enough (15 mins per breast excluding stimulation phase)and is painless.
1,This is a very bad item.,"I just bought this product for less than 2 weeks and the Sofefit shield is already broken.Then, I have to keep spending money to order replacements over and over again.I rated this product 1 star due to low reliability, I really don't like it.Anyone who interests in this item please just save your money and buy something else."
1,medela swing,"I bought this pump a month after my youngest was born,I was a 1st time breastfeeding momma so I was clueless about breastpumps. If I had to do it all over again I would not buy the swing again. I thought I just got a bad pump but that wasn't the case I contacted medela and they sent me a new motor however it was useless just like the first one. It doesn't suck as hard as you think a breastpump would. I can hand express more milk in less time! I thought maybe it was a low milk supply issue trust me it wasn't! I can only pump about 2 oz total and that's from both sides together. Either buy a more powerful one or save yourself the money and worry. I pump at the highest vaccume and it barly draws my nipples in and I'm using the correct size shield! Hope you find something better"
3,good enough,"prossuper lightweight, beats the backpack/briefcase pump if you are commuting by bus/foot like i doconsi find the pump to be loudmilk has backed up several timeson/off switch sensitive"
4,I would change two things...,"I would like the pump to be more powerful and quieter. Other than that, the pump is lightweight, easy to use, just the right size for travel, and comes with easy-to-follow instructions and trouble shooting options."
4,"Easy to use, very practical","I bought this to use for my second child after my first pump started to die with my first child (it was an 'occasional-use' pump that I used 24/7 for 7 months). This one is more practical than the first and is so much quieter. I love that I can carry it around the house using batteries, and that it's compact and easy to pack for traveling and at work.The only downfall is that the power cord falls out easily, which then turns off the pump."
1,Disappointed,"At first, I was really impressed with this product. I was using it multiple times a day when I got back to work. Then, inexplicably after 6 weeks, it stopped working. I bought a second one. 6 weeks after that, the pump lost suction. At $120+, I am unable to afford another. Due to the mediocre quality of this product, my milk is starting to go dry, as it will not provide adequate suction to maintain my supply. I bought this one from a friends recommendation--my own recommendation is to look elsewhere and try other products."
1,Arrived dented from Set 4 Baby,"Warning: Don't buy products from Amazon's vendors. This one arrived dented, and the seller (set 4 baby) and Amazon refused to do anything about it. There I was trying to get ready for my baby -- due any day -- and I'm dealing with a box sent with zero padding, and a seller who told me that if I opened it, they wouldn't take it back. I sent it back, confirmed by FedEx, and they haven't credited one penny. Their policy is a 15% restocking charge, even though they caused the problem, but actually they've not refunded anything."
1,Motor defective right out of the box,"I followed the instructions perfectly, pushed the ON button.....and nothing happened. The green light flashed off and on but there was NO motor sound and no suction at all. I hate to get defective products, especially from supposedly reputable companies. They are sending a new motor, but I will forever expect it to stop working at any moment because of this horrible first impression.And the AC adaptor plug comes out SO easy if it's pulled on or jiggled in the slightest, like others have complained about in their reviews.To produce milk efficiently, we are supposed to be relaxed and without stress to help our body pump effectively, and this pump has already caused me nothing but annoyance and stress. I'll never recommend Medela products just for the fact that I would be embarrassed to rave about it and then the person pull theirs out of the box BROKE."
2,Wish I'd bought something else,"I have been using the Swing to pump since my daughter was born 6.5 months ago. I haven't tried any other pumps, so I don't know if there is something better out there. But I find the Swing completely frustrating to use. As other reviewers have said, milk seems to go up into the tubing often. Also, sometimes it works and I get a couple of ounces but other times I get no milk at all, or just a drop or two. And this is when I KNOW there is milk in there because it's been a couple of hours since I nursed and I can feel my breasts are full. I'll spend 30 minutes pumping with nothing to show for it. I do use the Swing every day, but I wish I'd bought something different."
3,I don't know if it is me or the pump...,"As a stay at home mom, I didn't want to invest a lot of money into a pump to only use occasionally. At first, I couldn't get anything out, but now I am able to get a couple of ounces after 45 minutes ... which isn't great. For someone with an abundant milk supply, this might be a great pump."
2,disappointing,"the last trumpet was great. this is not. some stories have an amazingly weak plot. some are simply not interesting. some are not horror at all. some i don't even understand. it is well written, i'll give him that. but he needs better plots than this. it seems like he wrote these stories sufferig from an overdose of literature after a vacation. perhaps he will do better next time. promising battle descriptions in one story. some regular fantasy stories a la Robert E. Howard by Rainey wouldn't be a bad thing. i'll buy it if you write it, Rainey!"
2,Not good,"This movie was not good. It was bad. The sex scene's were too short, the stars were ugly, and it just didn't work. Save your money, and buy a different movie. I feel like I threw my money in the trash can when I bought this movie."
3,Still working through this one,"I needed some words to use to tell my teen-aged daughter and pre-teen son about our divorce. Dr. Emery wrote it is important to tell children in this age who initiated the divorce, and I used a his words, almost to the letter. So far, that has backfired with my daughter, who is very, very angry with me. I still believe the book will be a good reference, but I am ambivalent about taking his advice quite so literally."
3,"Unless you're the HULK, this thing is TOO BIG","Don't get me wrong, the watch is nice. However the rose gold face color looks like brass next to the black watch band. The face is HUGE. If you're looking for an all purpose watch that you can wear with suits and diving, I guess this is OK. However no one is going to compliment you on your sense of style. Do yourself a favor and get a nice business watch and another watch for diving. I seriously doubt this thin gold plating is going to hold up to salt water."
3,Charming snake documentary,"This is a good survey/history of snake-worship. Serpents (snakes) have been a part of religious observance for some 70,000 years, it seems. Fortunately, the DVD sticks to the last 3,000. It rambles a bit, and overall conclusions are a little scarce. Basically, author Philip Gardiner is trying to convince us that snakes are a large part of religious history, both visible and hidden.I was particularly intrigued by the short section which connected Ian Fleming to snake-worship, but again, there didn't seem to be any conclusion.As to ""Biggest Religious Cover Up in History,"" I think that's all hype. But certainly Gardiner has done us a favor by pointing out the various snake iconography in religious works, which may not get much attention otherwise."
4,Good book!,"It is a good book, with organized information. This book could be used not only as a review for therapeutic massage certification but as a part of your study guide during the program."
1,bad answers to sample questions makes the book worthless,"The information part of the book is OK. The sample questions are strikingly different than the several other review/sample test books that I have. What's really amazing is the bad answers. Some of them are so bad that I don't trust any of the answers, which means that the sample questions are worthless. Here's an example: ""Which of the following demonstrates good body mechanics?"" The answer listed as correct is ""Keep the feet and knees close together and bend at the waist."" OMG, that's awful! All of the questions have answers A, B, C or D to choose from. But answer 87 in the key is ""E"". Huh? Didn't anyone proof this book before it was published?"
3,Disappointed.....,"I purchased this book a few months ago, because of the reviews on Amazon. I used this study guide, made a few hundred flash cards and aced the review exams, but on the day I actually took the National Exam I failed. I was blown away by the difference between the type of questons asked on the exam vs. how I thought it was going to be from this review book. Yes, it was helpful to a degree, but I wouldn't bother purchasing save your money and spend it somewhere else. It is misleading."
3,Outdated and maybe too much to put into a study guide,This guide while informative is very confusing and there is just too much stuff in it! I looked at the first chapter and all I though was oh no I do not want to take my test if all this is on it! It is also I believe two years old. The test has been revamped since then. I like the Plain and Simple Guide instead. Amazon sells that one as well and I loved it! All I did was study that and passed my NCTMB.
4,Good book for review and self-testing,"This is a good book for reviewing for the NCE. Students using this book at our school have all passed with high scores! They all especially appreciated the chance to ""take the test before taking the test"" - being able to take an example test on the computer and be given their score prior to taking the real thing really boosted their confidence level."
4,A great little review book,"I really recommend buying this book. It's better than Mosby's Review, because it actually simplifies the concepts for you. I didn't get a feeling of being overwhelmed when I studied from this book. It's a good review for anatomy in general. It gives a great overview of each system, and I love that it went over contraindications for each disorder/disease too(very important). The only thing it is lacking would be information on Modalities. There just isn't enough. I got at least 4 or 5 questions(it may not seem like a lot, but it is, trust me) on Aromatherapy and essential oils (which ones do what, etc.) on my NCE, and if it weren't for my essential oil-addicted teacher in class, I wouldn't have had a clue about aromatherapy.Overall though, this book was VERY helpful, just make sure to review Eastern Medicine and holistic medicine outside of this book."
4,Amazing grace,"Martha is a young, sophisticated mother who runs away with her 6-year-old son, Duncan, after the death of a neighborhood child. She leaves her husband, David, whom she loves, to make a safer life for Duncan in a wilderness cave on the Rio Grande. An unlikely premise, you say? I thought so, too, but by the time David's detective catches up with her, I assure you that the story had not only grown on me but held me in complete thrall. The writing is beautiful and haunting, and the ending literally shocked me speechless. Which is, after all, a hallmark of great writing."
5,"I love this tea, but $9.09 is EXPENSIVE","Don't pay $9.09 for this tea. You can get it for $3.54. If you can't get it for that price at Amazon, go to vitacost.comI received the wrong tea. I ordered Tazo Organic Chai, but got Om (with peach & cucumber, which sounds disgusting)"
4,an all-cover cd was a great idea!,"This is only their 3rd cd, but it's the best one by far. The cd starts off with ""You're No Good"", which isn't very good. I don't know why they'd start the cd that way. When you get to songs like ""Already Gone"", ""Go Your Own Way"", and ""Get Together"", they sound great. In my opinion, those 3 particular songs sound better than the originals. Other Highlights are ""Monday Monday"" and ""Turn Turn Turn"". When Wilson Phillips does a cover song, they can usually make it sound better than the original artist, so this cd is a must have for Wilson Phillips fans, and fans of the original songs. Compare the versions. Even Carnie, who usually sucks when she's doing lead vocals (remember the song Someday I'll Be Next To You? Ug!!), sounds good on this one. Of course she still sounds better harmonizing with the other 2. There are no original Wilson Phillips songs on this cd, so even if you didn't like the first 2 albums, give this one a try."
2,Karaoke Day at the Wilson House,"It's just bad karaoke, folks. A huge disappointment. I looked forward to it, but other than ""Get Together"" and ""In My Room,"" there just isn't much here worth hearing."
1,Shame on You Wilson Phillips!,"I'm astounded by how truly bad this album is, and how amazon reviewers can actually give it 5 stars. Are we listening to the same record, folks? To me this album is just pointless, an expedient concept record designed to test the waters to see if the girls still have commercial viability. I guess if this album sells a few copies, the girls will have the incentive to actually go into the studio and write and record their own music. That's what artists do, isn't it? But you would think the girls could have mustered the strength and set aside some time in their schedules to write at least one song, especially since its been so long since we have had anything new from them. What a shame, and shame on you Wilson Phillips. Pure laziness."
1,Blah!,"Both ""Badlands"" books were a waste of time. I've just been catching up on my Star Trek reading and these were the last 2 of 7 books I had to read. It took me as longer to read them as the other 5. I can't put my finger on anything specific, it's just that they were very easy to put down."
2,Frustrated,"Found a couple really cute patterns here, but when I tried to make one of them I was totally frustrated. The pattern says to ""continue in pattern"" without allowing for any decreases. After 3 days of test swatches, I determined it is nearly impossible to knit the pattern as written in the size I wanted. I ended up substituting a different stitch pattern in order to make it work. Not how a good pattern book should be written."
5,"His best solo album, psychedelic, blusey pop.","This is where Jesse found his sound between the plantive folk of ""Black in America"" to the slow blues numbers to the collaboration with Sly Stone on ""Craazy"" to the black pop of""Do Yourself a Favor"" Johnson found his sound and his best songwriting and guitar playing album. Prince would do him one better with the groundbreaking ""Sign O the Times"" released 6 months later (Jesse's album came out in october 86)but put these albums together and what you see is a commitment to Black Music 's greatest traditions Musicianship and craft."
1,avoid,"Cheap junk. I expected standard metal lunchbox quality. This is a very thin metal, with a latch that is no match for any child. Ours now holds medicine and bandaids, since it is useless for children."
3,"Tools are nice, tool box is garbage","Received the tool set today and was checking it out before wrapping it up for my daughters birthday. Like the previous reviewer, my 4 year old daughter is also a huge Handy Manny fan and is constantly digging through my toolbox.The tools included in the play set are sturdy and nicely made (with the exception of the level). However, the case which holds the tools will be lucky to last a week. Upon initial inspection, the paper thin plastic that holds the tools in place was already detached from the outer casing and a few spots will be ripped open soon.Three stars overall because my daughter will love playing with the tools."
4,Awesome Toolset,"My two-year-old loves these tools. She's a huge fan of Handy Manny and always wants to help Dad fix things around the house. I thought these tools were more unisex than other sets I've seen so we purchased this as a Christmas gift. It's a great set but came with a plastic mold inside the box that the tools fit in. We threw away the plastic mold because it was just too flimsy and we opted, instead, to just lay the tools flat and close the box that way and it works fine. Great set of tools!"
2,Not as hyped,"he book cover makes prominent note of a website, which is still not available, three years after pub. date, and has never been. There is some useful info., though not very much, and certainly not enough to justify it's price. It is not well organized, nor well-written or laid out (and printed with a cheap typeface on cheap paper--like a Dover paperback, if you've seen them). The arguments regarding animal fat, as another reviewer from Boston wrote, are less than convincing. The book starts out with highly technical chemical information which is of little interest to lay readers. There is useful information on the benefits of tropical oils and the misrepresentation of fats on nutrition labels, which is helpful However, you might learn more about tropical oils, for free, from, say, the Spectrum Naturals website."
3,Hard to read,This book has a lot of scientific information but it is very hard to read for the average person.
2,Don't Bother,"This book is over priced and with an agenda, as previously described by the other 2 star reveiwers. The biochemistry review of the fats is good and I did find useful. However, I find much of the content far to ""on-the-fringe"" of scientific reality. Her basic idea that eating whole foods (or natural as she calls them) is good and sound advice, but you can get all that information for free. Save your money!"
3,"Swann Nighthawk mediocre, not great","1. Set up is easy. Receiver plugs straight into Video In of TV or VCR or PC capture card. Cames with 9 V batteries for quick setup before plugging in mains adapters for permanent installation.2. Image quality is poor (don't expect to recognize faces)3. Colour is virtually non existant (calling it a colour camera is close to a lie).4. Effective range in household situation is 20 metres max. Probably 100 m out in the desert, but then why would you need it there?5. Could only recommend it for first foray into home security."
3,"one is great, 2 suck","I bought this wireless camera because I have the wired version and have been utterly satisfied with the quality. I purchased the wireless because it states you can put up to 4 cameras on one transmitter. The first camera, the picture is just as good as the wired. The second and third camera, once they were added, all 3 had horrible reception. there was nothing but static from each one. If you are planning on just one, it is totally worth the investment. If you plan on connecting multiple cameras to one receiver, this is a bad solution."
1,Idiot Camera,"This camera/receiver operates on 2.4 GHz. So does just about everything else in the world of home electronics - most notably, cordless phones and wireless internet. And just about everything interferes with the signal from the camera to the receiver.This thing is so lousy it should be banned from the market. I have a camera approximately 15 feet from the receiver. I cannot see the picture unless I unplug my cordless telephone from the wall.How a company could build something so badly designed is a mystery to me."
1,Don't bother,"This product isn't good at any distance. I had it as close as 2 feet from the receiver, and it still wasn't worth it. Don't try to have it extend out any further than 10' without expecting serious degradation of quality. We got this camera with the intent of watching our 2 year old son at night. He likes to get out of bed and play with things at night, so we needed a way to observe from our room. Our bedroom is about 75' from his room. The frame rate was way too slow and the picture quality left a lot to be desired. I'm not sure of your planned use for the device, but it would be a waste for anything outside of watching a turtle crawl in the brightest room available. Then, and only then, you might be able to tell what you are watching."
5,A Must Have CD,"I purchased this album after hearing ""Sigh"" played on the local smooth jazz channel. It is a beautiful piece of music and has become extremely popular in the SF Bay Area. The other tracks on the CD are very good such as ""Teardrop Butterfly"". It is difficult to catagorize the Album. Smooth Jazz with a New Age twist? Or perhaps Exotic is the best way to describe it. The more you listen to the CD the more fascinating it becomes. Great music to listen to on those long commutes. I don't think you'll be disappointed in the album. Even if only purchased for ""Sigh""...it's well worth the dollars."
5,And they are awesome live as well,"Awesome. . .Praful presented their album during the Catalina Jazz Festival 2003. I, like many of you, heard ""Sigh"" many times on our local Smooth Jazz station. I was truly enlightened by their great presence and ability to connect with the crowd. Also, I was impressed with the groups smooth flow as they selectively drew in a new audience with each cut. Needless, to say I became a proud listening an CD buying fan. In the future, if you have an opportunity to see them in persons, enjoy."
4,Great Variety Of Good Stuff!!!,"This album is a really nice mix of stuff from the artist! Brazilian, East Indian, and electronic sounds, often intermingled. Quite interesting, skillful, pleasing to my ear. Well worth it, in my opinion. Check it out!"
3,Different but overdone,"Praful is certainly different as well as entertaining but some of the songs are a little looong and somewhat overdone (on purpose?) Some of his stuff brings to mind some of the so called ""art"" rock of the mid 70's which was somewhat bombastic although still endearing. Not a 9 as some would suggest, but at least a 7.5."
2,I guess every author has a clunker now & then,"It has an interesting premise and the beginning showed promise, but then the book seemed to focus on showing you how clever the author is. Endless detailed dialog about who's commanding the mission, focus on nipples, cutesy little responses from the main computer - anything but telling a story.Worse yet, then he starts citing all these other contemporary science fiction works, INCLUDING HIS OWN! So much for any chance of immersing oneself in another world - impossible when you are being reminded that you are reading a work of fiction about other works of fiction.I loved Stranger in a Strange Land and Jobe. This one I gave to my parrot - I would not foist this on another reader. I have only done that to one other book in my life."
1,Cool Premise - Brutal Execution,"Very Cool Premise Brutally Executed.I'll even give the die-hard Heinleiners the fact that he wrote it as a joke and in doing so tried to see how many of his other works (and those of others) he could include.But Man!!! How much of his hyperbole and preaching can one take? Further, he jumps between fine technical detail and generality often, sometimes within the same sentence. He tries in many places to tell the story through the characters dialog which he recreates in painstaking detail and never gets the point across as a result.The book follows form with his older stuff in that he becomes an ardent free sex advocate, and kind of perverted about it too.Don't get me wrong, I love a lot of his work. But this isn't his best.....it isn't even close. A waste of several hours."
1,I don't care if Heinlein was teaching us about writing...,"Heinlein was not a good prose writer nor was he a good storyteller at this stage of his life. This book is awful, the story is bad, the writing is even worse. It took me 1 read through to get that he's trying to teach the reader how to write well but if you read Heinlein's body of work, with a few notable exceptions where he does write well or tells the story well, most of his works are horrible prose and even worse in the story department. You learn from writing well by reading good prose and good writing not from reading the opposite."
2,"Great promise, died on the vine.","I was lost in this book. The characters were in and out of focus. It started out with a feeling that it would be great. But it did not work out that way. Of all of his books, this one was the most confusing in overall direction."
2,Far from his best,"I first read this book when it came out in 1980 (I was a *huge* Heinlein fan at the time), and I remember being vaguely disappointed with it at the time. Now, having read it again 20 years later, I'm no more impressed with it.Part of Heinlein's charm to me has always been his ability to make his characters so likeable, regardless of where his plots took them. He's managed that early on with this book - but he soon gets bogged down with trying (and never really succeeding) to be clever. The convoluted 'storyline' soon takes over, but never goes anywhere satisfactory - or even particularly entertaining. It's just one literary reference/gag after another, none of them particularly clever or satisfying to this reader. Even the Heinlein in-jokes and references don't have the charm to pull this book out of the mire it's stuck in.Not his best, not by a mile."
2,Not the Heinlein's finest.,"I must agree with rschering's remarks. If I wanted to reada soft porn novel, I'd go to a book store on Times Square."
3,good but way too dirty,"Good but way too dirty. Heinlein can be one dirty old man sometimes, in fact quite often. This is not bad in and of itself. However it is when it detracts from the storyline which it does in the case much too often. In this book he will often interupt the fast paced story for a nice little orgy or sex romp. Reads like a porn movie at times. He should have just stuck to hardcore sci fi, I mean hard sci fi AHHH! YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN =/"
2,B-O-R-I-N-G!!!,"Well actually this book could have been a masterpiece,but it was so full of science details that none understands,also it was kinda weird,and the plot just stayed in the place and didn't developed on,the idea plot was good and it could be intersting if there could have been more action,and one the things it was so needed to is pure action,but it didn't,so the book was kinda lost,and i think someone should try to rewrite it,with less complax science details (alot less!),more action,a plot that can develop somewhere,and make it alot more intersting and not that boring."
3,NOT ALL NATURAL RED 40 IS ADDED,"LIPTON USED TO BE ALL NATURAL WITH NO ARTIFICIAL COLORING. FOR SOME REASON, THEY FELT THE NEED TO ADD RED 40 TO THE PRODUCT. IT TASTE THE SAME, BUT YOU CAN SEE THE RED IN THE MIX. IT WAS NOT NECESSARY."
3,Good phone,"I have an iPod and was not looking to replace it. I have had several uberphones in the past few years. All of them were never good at being either phones or PDAs or whatever. This phone is a great phone, a great mp3 player, a radio, and so much more. I have a mac Powerbook Pro, this phone is findable by my bluetooth. I send it mp3's wirelessly."
2,Item quality and vendor's customer service unsatisfactoy,"The sweatshirt has a cardboard feeling that does not conform to the body. My husband is 6' 178 pounds, so he does not have a problem finding clothes that fit, but this one looked like a stiff kite on him.BE AWARE The items were returned and the vendor took over five weeks after receiving the item back to refund the money, and only after I had filed a complaint with Amazon. Amazon acted quickly to post the credit."
3,Average,"As far as hand books go I am somewhat disappointed in this text. Even once you get past the rather ... feel of the handbook you can't help but be disappointed by the typos, especially for a text which has been copyrighted three times but still gives you the feeling that it never made it past its first edition. With this in mind, the text does cover a wide variety of topics and pearls in an outline format. If you are looking for a small, lightweight guide to give you high-yield basics without any detail or elaboration and enjoy reading multiple lighthearted quotes of little if any clinical value, then go for it. However, especially if you are interested in medicine, you will feel more comfortable being seen with Tarascon's Internal Medicine and Critical Care Pocketbook, which I feel is superior given its numerous charts and tables, as well as appopriate details and brief discussions, not a laundry list."
4,Fun with Math & Money,"I got this register for my 4 year old last year at Christmas. The paper money didn't last long as it was folded, wadded, and packed into her purses and wallets. The coins also have wandering tendencies. This calculator has helped as she started kindergarten and wants to play with numbers.The register is very durable. The drawer pops out VERY fast and will spill the coins out all over if you aren't sitting in front of the drawer to slow it down.It's still a hit and I think that makes it a winner in my house."
5,Fun and educational,"I bought this toy for my four year old Grandson. He loves playing ""store"" with the cash register. The money is fairly real looking, so a child could learn to recognize denominations. My Grandson is too young to understand the calculator part of the register, but he loves to see the numbers come up on the screen. It's great for number recognition too."
3,"Works fine, not entertaining enough..","Bought this for my son's 4th bday. He likes to play with one at school that looks more like an old time stand up register. Basically this one is a large solar calculator with a cash drawer. We thought he'd go nuts over it, but its clearly ""that gift"" that isn't getting played with. Maybe he will in the future."
3,Great aside from On and Off buttons being reversed!,"My 2 1/2 year old son loves this toy! There are just a few issues:1.) Agree with other reviewers, the drawer opens with too much force and all the coins go flying.2.) The ""off"" button turns the toy on and the ""on"" button turns it off...so much for educating the kids on words and actions.I considered returning it due to the switched buttons, but I don't think we could be without the toy now that my son has it! He loves to have us ""go shopping"" and buy stuff from him!Great toy-one of his favorites so far (ranks right up there with Thomas.)"
1,"This ""large calculator"" isnt worth $30.00","To describe this toy in brief I'd have to say all it is is a large calculator that makes a ""ding"" noise when it opens. I purchased it for my 6 year old so she can practice math through productive play but for what I spent ($33) I was better off purchasing her fake money from the 99cent store and a large calculator, I would've save a good amount of bucks and it wouldve been the same effect. The dollar bills and coins do not look realistic as advertised and it is not solar powered it uses a cell battery. So much for reading reviews! If it didnt cost dam near as much as I paid for it to send it back I wouldve sent it back as soon as I opened it and tried it out. It didnt captivate her amusement but for 30min. There are better options out there. DON'T BUY THIS TOY FOR MORE THAN $10 As for durability it is sturdy. The plastic is very thick."
5,learning resources pretend and play calculator cash register,it is excellent because it has a gift card and various denominations of money so the children can learn from it.
4,Extremely informative and appropriate,"Preparation for the GED can be difficult and scary, but this text is written and presented in such a way the students will feel more confident. All areas of the test are covered thoroughly without being burdensome. The text also covers all skill levels within each subject. One concern might be the expectation that the student has the reading level necessary for comprehending the explanations, I would suggest some information being provided in the introduction about a minimum reading level needed to use this text."
3,Carafe Problems,"Great coffee is made with this machine, and the value is great also. The carafe that comes with the unit sucks. When you go to pour coffee you will find that it dripples all over your counter. The carafe needs a longer pouring spout."
1,Garbage,"I can not believe that a company as large as Mr. Coffee can sell such junk. Impossible to pour a cup without spilling. A Bunn carafe will pour many cups while this one dribbles all over the counter. Specifically, this is the original carafe that came with the coffee maker in black."
3,Just Ok,"This is an ""Ok"" coffee decanter because it can break easily. I love the Mr. Coffee machine I have so I bought a replacement when the original decanter broke. Just handle with care. Doesn't deserve more than 3 stars."
2,"Great idea, weak development.","Although I felt I had much in common with the author, I could not identify with her. This book is like a long rambling letter from someone you went to school with but didn't really care about. I think she displays great courage in bringing up the issue of virginity in our sex-saturated society. She also brings up the virgin/whore sexual dichotomy felt by many women. She just doesn't address these issues with any kind of depth. It seems that she doesn't address the relationships in her life with any kind of depth either. She's indignant at men who want to have sex with her without examining her own actions and motivations which led her to be physical with them in the first place. Overall this brings up some excellent issues and ideas that should be expored, unfortunately she addresses them in a shallow and at times immature way. Perhaps if she rewrites this book when she is older and has more perspective it will be worth reading... this book however just isn't."
2,lousy,Too bad I didn't read the reviews before I bought the book. It was bad! The author kept on digressing and the book was such a cliche. Do not buy this book.
4,"Good, but it's getting repetitive...","Louise Rennison is a great author, the books are WICKED funny, but.... I can't help but feel like im just re-reading Angus, Thongs and Full- Frontal Snogging with a few changes. Like, she meets super hot guy, super hot guy goes out with Wet Lindsay, etc. Also, it seems like the book was not really detrailed enough. and when i got really excited about the end (can't tell you guys, you'll have to read it) it just sorta... stopped. I have to say that this book is awesome, but it felt a bit like it was just a filler before the next one came out. But still, I recomend it to anoyone who's a fan of the series."
5,So much Chomsky,"There is so much of this book, and it is all great reading.The book is based on question and answer sessions between Chomsky and various audiences. The editing organizes the content by topic. I like the question and answer style; usually someone asked the question I have in mind, so I feel part of the conversation.If I had to complain about anything: Since it wasn't created as one coherent volume, Chomsky repeats similar topics sometimes. The editing does a good job of sorting the content by topic, but occasionally you reread thoughts that you saw before."
4,A Classic Comedy!,"Filmed many times, this original version is amusing, but in 1940, Howard Hawks re-made it as ""His Girl Friday,"" which is by far the winner."
4,Cute but harder to dress then other princesses,"We got this for my daughter's fifth birthday. She already has the Cinderella one and loves it. We also got Aurora, Jasmine and Snow White for christmas, but since she hasn't recieved them yet, I guess I can't say much about them. Ariel is pretty and comes with the bird and the fish. The thing I didn't like about her though, is because her hair doesn't change and is long and molded plastic, her dresses are VERY hard to get on, my daughter has to bring them to me to change them. Other then that, Cinderella and Ariel are getting along together well. If you can keep track of all their teeny tiny pieces, they are a great gift!"
2,"Cute, but fragile","I bought this for my nearly three year old daughter, and the pieces were really flimsy. She loved playing with it, but some of the pieces broke."
2,Thorough but Poorly Organized,Puchased this text to help review for the LARE exam. The text has all of the necessary information but is not layed out well. Illustrations are not located on pages where they are referenced in the text making it so that you have to flip back and forth across several pages to understand the text in relation to the examples.The larger problem with the book is that the answers to Exercises are not given. You will have no way to determine if you are completing the problems correctly or not. The only way to find out will be to have them reviewed by another Landscape Architect or Engineer.The text functions well as a reference for Landscape Architects to review formulas or storm water calculation techniques but if you are trying to use it for developing skills or for exam preperation I would not recommend it.
1,This book is not helpful,"I am a first-year BLA student, and this text is required for an introductory course in site grading and drainage. This book is very difficult for me to read and understand. Descriptions of calculations are very poorly presented in paragraph narrative, which is mind-numbing to read and comprehend. If the calculations were presented in a step-by-step format, like a math text, they would be dramatically more clear and understandable. I agree with a previous reviewer, as well, that the layout is dysfunctional because the text and corresponding graphics are not on facing pages. This problem is particularly annoying, considering that landscape architecture is a design profession that emphasizes legibility in graphics and presentation material. I would welcome anyone's recommendations for a text that explains this subject in a more helpful way."
2,Abysmal instructions... 2 Stars for Nice Cover/,"Abysmal instructions...This book seems to assume the reader is already a trained landscape architects reviewing for the LARE exam.This textbook manages to take rather simple theories and turn them into Quantum physics by the virtue of jargon, verbose explanations, dismal graphics, - and get this: They are No answers to the exercises in this book.The authors are undoubtedly very knowledgeable regarding Site engineering, but either clueless or indifferent to techniques of effective instruction."
3,"Very interesting, But...","I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. I read it cover to cover in a short amount of time. However the title is rather misleading. This is definitely not a technical manual. If you have an old engine that wont run, this is not the book to help. It covers very basic workings of engines. I did find the book to be an excellent starting place for one interested in tinkering with old engines as a hobby. It inspired me to go ahead and give it a shot. After reading it I have proceeded to buy other more technical books. If you're interested in this sort of thing, it's worth reading just for the historical information."
4,Entertaining read about old small engine history,I found this book very entertaining. I really enjoyed it. It was not what I expected. I bought it hoping it would be a good book to explain the basics of small engines to my 12 year old son. It is not a good book for that. There is clearly a focus on history and older pieces of equipment. The author seems particularly enamored with old 2 cycle engines.
5,Great book,"There is nothing to complain about this product. I need it for school so just have to buy it, I enjoyed it"
3,"Not Bad, Not Great","While I haven't had the pleasure of having Buffa for a professor (and by all accounts I'm planning on avoiding it), the book really isn't that bad. The sample problems are helpful and the escalating difficulty is appreaciated.The downside is that he tends to get bogged down in little details that aren't really as important as he makes them out to be--especially considering that the book is for people who don't need calc-based Physics (read life science majors, and all non-science related majors who need a GE), and occasionally the problems seem totally unrelated to what has been presented in the text.Still, as far as text books go, this one isn't bad and if you have a good teacher to go along, it'll serve you just fine."
2,Only leaf illustrations in this one,"Neat book if you need to know what the leaves of a particular tree look like, but that's it. There's no photos, only illustrations, and no illustrations of the shape of the tree or its height, just the leaves themselves. It's a cute illustration job, but unless you need to know about the leaves, I would pass this one by, and even if you think you've narrowed down which tree it is by the leaves, how can be sure that it's the same tree if there are no illustrations of the trees themselves? Probably a good book to sell in a gift shop to give a curious kid."
3,Good Voice - Good Songs!,"Bobby Vee was one of many ""Bobbies"" in pop-music in the 1960?s. His best and best-known recordings are from 1960-62 which is the period this fine compilation covers. Vee had a very good voice, not unlike Buddy Holly`s, though not having Holly`s charm and magic.Vee never made it real big; suffered a little from his ""Mother`s favourite son-in-law"" image and probably lacked the necessary originally.Still, there are many fine recordings here. Vee is backed by the best musicians of the time; people like the Crickets and the Ventures.Vee did not write mamy of these songs himself, but he had a skill for choosing good material that fit his style and voice well.My personal favourites on this CD are ""Take Good Care of my Baby"", ""Rubber Ball"", ""Little Star"" and Vee`s own ""Don`t You Believe Them"""
5,Go Clint Eastwood!!,"If you like fist fighting, raunchy humor and hilarious old ladies you'll love this movie. Oh, and let's not forget good old Clyde. This humorous Orangutan just added the extra oomph this movie needed. The action was great and if you're a Clint Eastwood fan these movies are a must have."
5,This show is my new Obssession!,Lost girl for me has reached Buffy status! I rewatch episodes over and over again while showing it to people that have never heard of it before....creating Lost girl addicts! I'm so happy I bought this series because between the stories and the characters on this show it truly gives you a sense awe and amazement that in my opinion hasn't been on tv since Buffy lefted!
2,This book not recommended,"I found this book to be very disappointing. All this book basically is is interviews with doctors and patients in regards to different treatment alternatives. If you are trying to TREAT fibromyalgia, i definitely do not recommend this book. If you really want someones gripes and groans about fibromyalgia you can get that point of view FREE on line on Fibromyalgia web sites. If you want alternative treatments options- try The Fibromyalgia Nutrition Guide, although this book is all about nutrition, it is very easy to us and very helpful- All us fibromyalgics know about homeopathic stuff already such as massage and Alternative Treatments just reiterates that and has patients and doctor points of view on Massage, Chiropractic care, Etc...."
5,Best of Byerly's Cookbook,My granddaughter was very heppy to receive this cookbook. I'm sure she will enjoy it for many years to come.
1,I want my money back,"I can't believe I waited 3 months to view this movie set. It it absolutely terrible. All the films are of horrible quality. I honestly can't believe I paid for this set. The movies have bad sound and look as though they were recorded off the tv in the 90's. The picture quality is worse than if it were playing on tv. Blurry, grainy. I wish I could get my money back. What a waste. I wouldn't even feel honest selling this piece of junk to someone else."
2,Powell & Lombard: Comedy Collection,The movies were great but the quality of the dvd was not. The dvd would get stuck before loading and would require several attempts to get the movie started.
5,easyshare,I have had the pleasure of using this product for a while. The easy share product line is great for the casual person. I highly recommend it (with the printer).
1,inconsistent size,rider needs to get their sizing of their jeans universal and consistent --- i ordered these one size bigger than what i normally wear and they were about 2 sizes tooo small----
1,Green Tea,The Green Tea was old product. The Tea bags easily tore when they were opened. I will not order any tea from Amazon
3,Tedious time travel,"Poor beautiful Bella is a wimp, afraid to sing, afraid to be on stage, afraid of men. Boo hoo! I really got tired of her indecision and feeling sorry for herself.The tiresome tenor Jacques is a flirt, a womanizer and all-out obnoxious and egotistical creep who won't take ""NO!"" for an answer.And does everyone in New Orleans eat nothing but beignets from Cafe du Monde? I think not!"
3,Nice book but not the seller,When I received the book I ordered in Jan 2007 I was disappointed to find pages missing and holes in some pages. I complained to Bookarama but they never responded. I then complained to amazon and that got a response from Bookarama offering a refund. I returned the book in July 2007 and have not received any response from them. I guess I must complain to amazon again to see if they can get their dealer to provide a refund for a damaged book.
3,Lack overall coherence,"Some of the chapters are insightful---really linking us to the source of love and being that makes our hearts alive. Several others are similar to newspaper columnists giving common advice. If you get it, focus on the diamonds in the rough."
4,Excellent toy!!,Excellent toy and a lot of fun for my toddler. She has read the book many times and loves seeing the illustrations from the book in the game.
3,Not one of the best.,This book wasn't that good and only a little scary. I would have to say that I would read it only if I had to.
4,Not What You Expected,"It's not what you expect, but in a good way. I think it was one of his better ones plot wise."
2,An unsuccessful collaboration,"I've read several of L. Neil Smith's books, and this was by far the weakest of the lot. Unlike, say, PALLAS, which held my interest from beginning to end, THE MITZVAH just didn't work for me. I kept putting it down and finding it hard to get motivated to resume reading. This may be a function of the fact that the book is a collaboration, and collaborations usually don't work well. Or it may just be that this one is more overtly propagandistic than Neils's earlier novels. Whatever the reason, I can't really recommend this book to anyone. There are better books on the importance of our right to self-defense using firearms, and better novels by Neil Smith. Pass on this one!"
2,"Good story, very important issues but mediocre presentation.","The author Aaron Zelman is the courageous founder of Jews for the Preservation of Gun Ownership. Mr. Zelman believes that an armed Jewish society would not have become a victim of the Nazi Holocost. In his story the Mitzvah he portrays the story of a liberal Catholic priest who discovers his Hebrew roots and learns that the path to being a free people must be traveled armed. The Mitzvah explores many very important issues, but the writting is second rate. The Mitzvah needs some rounding out and some strong editing. The Mitzvah is a quick read and I enjoyed it, but it is not on par with John Ross's book Unintended Consequences."
3,"great body wash, not the best shampoo","I like this product for a body wash, but it isn't the best shampoo. My daughter has long hair and it leaves her hair a little greasy. I think it a great product for small babies, who don't have a lot of hair."
1,The World's Thinnest Excuse,"Save your money. The dated information in this pricey book is widely available for free.Furthermore, let's clear up the two misconceptions Bodart uses to sell this book.First -- a ""Reluctant Reader"" is not at all the same thing as a lazy student who has procrastinated and put off an assigned book report. If that's the problem, I'd suggest a book on time-management.Secondly, a book's page count has nothing to do with its quality. A 50-page novella may be far more complex than one that's 300 pages long.If Bodart's intention was to create a booklist of quick, easy reads -- she has failed. If the idea was a collection of crib notes, the brief book descriptions in this publication will be of little value.For reluctant readers -- or the parents and educators who love them -- do yourself and your wallet a favor . . . get help from your local librarian."
5,amazingly valuable resource,"My marriage ended because of my addiction to cybersex.I am finally on the path to a new life. Therapy and a 12-step group are the key to recovery for me. I have found this book to be an amazingly valuable resource. Many of the other sexual addiction books are too broad... discussing many kinds of sexual addiction that I do not suffer from. But this book speaks directly to me.If you have a problem with internet pornography, or even think you do, I reccomend this book. It paints a clear picture of your problem, and helps you begin to be honest with yourself about the extent of your problem. This is not psychobabble or uninformed ""self-help"" garbage. This book offers specific steps to recovery. You'll find that you cannot recover on your own (something I tried many times, but failed). Get this book -- you'll be happy you did."
3,Hasn't been updated since 1999!,"While overall this is a pretty good book, it was published originally back in 1999. There has been a lot of Trek since then and this book should be updated with a newer edition to reflect that.Sternbach and Okuda did a great job, but it's just out of date."
5,A great Encyclopedia!,I have owned this book for awhile now and I think this is a wonderful book! If you love Star Trek then buy this BOOK!
5,what can i say,"ministry of sound is the club in europe. be it at ibza or london, ministry has been putting out the best dance for years. this is no different. although lacking the power of van dykes ""for an angel, the cd enpowers you through tunes such as my life. the best of europe"
4,Works as advertised,Works well on nose. I used a lighted magnifying mirror while using the nose trimmer. Easy to operate and light weight.
2,Broke on its own after a couple of months,"I have owned two within a year. The first one broke after I dropped it in the sink. As for the second one, after reading these reviews, I thought I had it nailed down that this was the one to buy. Not sure if I bought a lemon, but this stopped working after a couple of months (not sure why).Now I am looking into another one, but I am skepticle that these niche trimmers are as durable as any standard electric shaver.Somebody prove me wrong."
2,NFG,"I received one of these as a Christmas gift a couple of years ago. It worked great for almost a year and then the blades would turn very weakly. It would barely trim anything. I thought it was the battery, but, I would put in a new one and I would get the same result. It would finally get so weak that it would pull my nose hair. I eventually bought another one. I guess I didn't learn my lesson the first time. It worked great for the first 6 months or so and then it gradually would get weaker and weaker, subsequently pulling my nose hairs. Changing the battery didn't matter. Don't buy this unit!"
2,Underpowered,I am really disappointed with this product. The battery seems to run down immediately and misses a lot of hair in my ears.
1,Price says it all,The trimmer does not cut most hair without a significant amount of gyrations of angles for it to get the hair in the openings. The light is worthless. At least it doesn't pull hair when cutting. I would not recommend this unit.
3,Good but not great,"Ok I've never had a nose trimmer so maybe there all the same...I rate this one 3 stars because it does cut, but not enough to say ""I see no hairs"" There is always some hint of nose hairs, it's not a lot and all that are left are very very short, but you can still see them. So if u think buying a trimmer will complete shave everything, this is not your choice.The light is useless, unless u r planning on trimming in the dark"
1,Broke after second use,Not well constructed - very cheaply made. I would have returned it but it probably would have ended up costing me more in time and effort.
2,Cheaply made nose trimmer,"I purchased this trimmer, and as usual Amazon.delivered. I wrote back to tell them the trimmer stop working after two weeks and they sent me a new one, no charge. The new one seems to be working fine, so we will see. I have yet to have a negative experience dealing with amazon.com."
3,Panasonic Nose/Hair Trimmer,"This trimmer does a good job trimming nose hair. However, I find problens with its operation. It is difficult to turn on. There are times it doesn't turn on until I reinsert batteries."
3,Good while it works,This is my third nose and ear hair trimmer. It works great for a while and then has to be replaced --usually about 12 months of service. Would love to find one that works as well . . . longer.
2,painful experience,"after finally finding a smooth operating trimmer at ""sharper image"" years ago I found that when I had to replace it , the new unit was terrible. So I returned it and did some research and this was the one I came up with. Well this one is worse. If I wanted to pull the hair out of my nose all I need is a pair of tweezers. Not enough power or not sharp enough blades I dont know which."
1,Bad Customer Service,"Didn't arrive in working condition. Panasonic's customer service was incredibly rude, and they have an annoying 'voice recognition' system up front that doesn't work very well, and there is no work around."
4,kinda good trimmer,"I used this item a few times before it was stolen from my house during a burglary. I hope the thieves use it and get the horrible disease that is in my nose, those pieces of crapp"
3,Worth the Money,Can't beat the price and it does a fabulous job. Just wish they would get rid of the light to save the battery.
1,Built to fail,"Unfortunately, like so many things made by Panasonic, this item quits within a year, even with light use. I've bought two, and they both have failed within a year. It's not a good deal if you have to keep buying them."
3,Good choice,"A friend recommended that a Sharper Image product was the best to buy. Unable to find one, I chose this and am quite pleased with the performance and price. Does the job, comfortable, easy to use."
3,"not bad, not as good as its predecessor","I bought this model because Panasonic discontinued the ER411 (which I had damaged the nose cone slightly by dropping the unit). Also, I tried a model Brookstone was selling which I had to trash as completely useless. Turns out this new model has a straight blade set-up which does not perform as well as the old curved blades. Fortunately I was able to swap the nose cones - which remained unchanged between the models - and continue using my trusty older model (trims hairs like a razor without cutting or nicking.)"
4,Panasonic Nose Hair Trimmer,"I have used this item before from sharper image. I had a similar unit (probably a panasonic unit repackaged for Sharper Image because it is exactly the same item) It worked for about a year then died. So, here I bought another one. It does what it's supposed to do...trims nasal hairs without cutting your nose. Nothing exciting, just does the job fairly well, but not perfectly."
5,don't be affraid of one!,I bought this trimmer off Amazon for like 18 bucks. When I received it I was excited to use it. It doesnt pull hair at all! Its kinda scary because you think its gonna catch the inside of your nose but it didnt at all! It was quick and the added eye brow trimmers are great! I would however go to walmart and buy it for 13 bucks.
2,"Does the job, but not durable","This trimmer was gentle and worked well on my small nose. I loved the fact that it was wet/dry. The light was not a really useful tool. Disappointingly, the trimmer died after less than 2 years. My previous model lasted much longer."
3,Worked well while it worked.,"Worked well while it worked. It died after only a year. Great stocking stuffer, but I wanna find one for the hubby that works longer."
1,"I use it, but...","It's not really powerful, doesn't do a great job, and the light...well the light is absolutely worthless. The light ""never"" shines where it will do any good. It's angled so that there is no way to make it point where you are ""working"". It's heavy, works, but is not fast. There really is no reason to have the light on this unit. It's not bright enough to see anything anyway."
2,Not great,I don't understand the purpose of the light. It's small and low and doesn't seem to add any benefit. You have to go over one spot 3-4 times for it to actually work.
2,Stopped working after a few months,This trimmer worked relatively well for a few months and then just stopped operating. I then bought the Panasonic ER-GN30-K trimmer. It stopped operating after one use. I have now ordered a Groom Mate manual trimmer. It doesn't use batteries so I shouldn't have to worry about it not operating.
2,Short life span for hair trimmer,"This trimmer was good while it lasted... but it didn't have a very long lifespan. Yes, I checked the battery, but it simply died after only a few uses. Nothing you can do with a dead trimmer.. it doesn't even make a good book mark! hahaha!"
3,Ouch,I had an eairler version of this model and it was great. This one does not trim it plucks!!!!Yes it does hurt!!I gave it three stars 'cause if you go in at an angle it trims pretty good.
1,"Don't buy this, nothing is covered under warranty.","Read all the low ratings as I had all the experiences told.What really sucks is that after using this awkwards, not-so-smoothe trimmer, is when my wife tells me I still have hair sticking out. After a plastic on the actual trimmer broke, Panasonic gave me no assistance to fix or replace."
1,P.O.S.--Dont Buy,"This sucks. Blades dull and motor weakens over time. Even with new battery will run slow and catch on your nosehair and stop, painful. The light is a complete joke."
1,Unusable product,I returned the product because it did not work after installing several new batteries.The product was defective right out of the box.
2,Not so Great,I was not so impressed with this product. It really didn't work. So I bought a different brand at another store in the mall!
3,"Nose hair trimmer OK, not great.",OK.Smaller than photographs make it appear (4 inches).Very light and plasticy--probably won't last very long.Not as well made as my Braun shaver.Works well enough to use until it fails.FYI: Light is useless -- it points outside your nose when trimming!
4,Does what it's supposed to. Light is not very useful.,"After having a cheapo Wahl nose trimmer for a few years I decided to ""upgrade"" to this Panasonic with it's much touted ""headlight"". As a nose hair trimmer it seems to do a marginally better job than the Wahl, but I found the light difficult to aim and it was so dim I had to turn the room lights off in order to see the beam cast by it. Oh well, it's just a nose hair trimmer, not a BMW 7 series. Can't be too picky, right?"
2,don't expect much,"Panasonic ER421KC is not what was advertised. Based on the Sharper Image unit I replaced when it failed (after many years of service), this unit is slow and time consuming for what should be a simple procedure-remove nose hair. The low intensity light is of little use since it doesn't illuminate much. The unit was easy to clean and handle. If you have alot growing on up there or in your ears look for a more ""industrial"" strength model."
1,Worthless item,"I bought this product to replace an old-but-still-working nose-hair clipper I've had for ages. I have to say that this one doesn't begin to compare with the old one....extremely ineffective, difficult to use, and thoroughly disappointing in every way. You almost have to trap a single hair in the middle of the top of this device, and even then, it takes repeated attempts just to remove a single hair. Worthless."
2,Less than expected,"I have a Panasonic ER415 that works great. I need another one and I made a bad assumption that the 421 would be better than the 415 since I thought it was a later model. But unfortunately that's not nearly the case. The 415 cuts much closer and provides a clean, smooth finish around the nose and ears. On the other hand the 421 is not really much better than the cheap, off-brand $10 trimmers you'll find in discount stores. Very disappointing."
1,Too thin...,These hand pads are too thin to be usable for sparring as they provide no protection for the person you are hitting. They may work well for bag work. Get the thicker ones if you plan to spar against actual people.
4,about what you'd expect.,good tea at a good price. its almost totally average in every way. sometimes no surprises is a good thing.
3,"Miss the oldie, the new one is cheapie","I was really looking forward to the quality of the spirograph I had as a child, but to my dismay, the box tore immediately (thin cardboard), no storage for the pieces so some pieces got lost immediately. I am hoping that the quality improves because I did enjoy this toy as a child."
3,Mixed feelings,"Spirograph was one of those toys that sat on my closet shelf in its box. When I thought to take it out to play with it, it was a lot of fun and I enjoyed making amazing designs. However, dealing with the small pieces usually seemed like too much trouble."
1,"Worthless, with little relation to the Spirograph of old","My wife and I both enjoyed the original Spirograph 25+ years ago. The original set included many ""gears"" with pins to hold them down, and was a quality toy. It was a big deal to get a Spirograph. I took pains to keep it in good shape, and I used it for several years. What a disappointment to see the Spirograph name attached to this collection of plastic junk. We bought it for our son for his sixth birthday, expecting him to enjoy it as we had. Sorry, son, for the horrid present."
2,Just not the same,"When I played with Spirograph about 25 years ago, they were made with this really tough plastic and the wheels were not dark colored. The different sizes had different colors. There were many sizes and shapes to choose from. Not any more. I bought the beginning Spirograph set for my daughter and then thought she was old enough for the bigger, more advanced set later. The set I received had warped wheels that would not roll in the grooves when you wanted them to, and turned into a really frustrating experience for both of us. The wheels were a dark blue and was hard to see the lighter colors we tried to use (gel pens). I could not even use it right. ...."
2,3 is Way Too Young,"This toy is rated for ages 3 and up, but the small pieces are impossible for a little one to keep track of. My daughter was heartbroken when the glass slippers went missing, despite our best efforts to count pieces before putting the toy away. She definitely can't dress the doll herself, and even my husband has trouble with it. My daughter admittedly loves this toy, but it's more about the Cinderella-factor than the toy itself. Save your money."
5,I BROKE MINE,"I didnt want to have another party, but now I dont have too,,, I love pampered chef, and I dropped my baker and I have the basket to go with it, so I had to replace it..."
1,SAVE YOUR MONEY,I HAD HAD A COUPLE DIFFERENT PEOPLE RECOMMEND THIS BOOK TO ME AND COULDN'T WAIT TO START IT. I WAS SO DISSAPPOINTED. I COULD NOT EVEN READ IT. I READ 70 PAGES AND GAVE UP. IT WAS LIKE A VERY CONFUSING MYTHOLOGY TEXTBOOK. EXTREMELY HARD TO READ AND UNDERSTAND. I DIDN'T EVEN GIVE THE BOOK TO SOMEONE ELSE I JUST THREW IT OUT.
3,"Good for modelers, brief for historians","From the point of view of a modeler, this book is a great source on all details about the BEF (British Expeditionary Force) in WWI. It has plenty of (black and white) photos as well as the usual Osprey center color plates, with complete explanations at the end. For historians, it's a bit too thin, but for modelers it comes out great.You could add Osprey's ""MONS 1914"" for a more complete view of the BEF."
5,Graphic novel. Excellent version.,"The reviews here seem to refer to the print edition of the book. This is the graphic novel version and one of the finest fantasygraphic novels you'll find. Russell was at his weirdest and best in this one and Thomas does an excellent, faithful script. Great stuff, but it's mainly pictures! All these Thomas versions aregood and the artwork is often superb."
2,Hard to taste the true Rooibos flavor,"This tea blend is very flavorful, but the hibiscus, lemon myrtle, rosemary, and other spices completely overpower the rooibos flavor. Some people will like the additions Tazo has added to this red bush blend, but you can not taste the real rooibos flavor. This blend does not mix well with cream or milk, but it goes well with sugar. I agree with others in that you should not steep for more than 5 minutes, as it becomes too strong.If you want to try a true red bush tea, try Freshpak Rooibos Tea. It does not have the additional flavors that you see on store shelves. And it goes very well with some cream and sugar/honey.2 stars for not delivering a true red bush tea, because the additions overpower the rooibos. It should have been titled, ""Herbal Mix tea with a touch of red bush flavor."""
1,Horrible...,"I bought this book for my cisco academy class and consider it a waste of money.It is way too technical for someone just starting out such as myself.It very hard to read and very hard to understand.I bought Cisco Certified Network Associate Study Guide, 5th Edition (640-801) by todd lammle to use for my class and i can tell you...it is a hundred times easier to read and understand."
3,Not the place to start but still a good CD,"If your new to Travis let me suggest--Coming Around, Turn, or Why does it always rain on me, as a place to start.""Writing to reach you"" is a good song. It's one of those that ends up growing on you. I wasn't really sure I liked it until I caught myself humming it.Travis has a fresher sound than most bands out there. Most of it unfortunately isn't going to be played on the radio (In the USA at least) so you should invest in at least one CD.I give it three stars only because of the price, this is a five star song. It's just that for four dollars more you could have their full album--""The man who""Any way, I say invest in Travis, they are worth it."
1,WARNING! Amazon's links here are wrong!,"There are two entirely different products that Amazon is confused about and considers the same. The one called ""Destinos, Part A: Lessons 1-26, Student Audio CD Program [AUDIOBOOK] (Audio CD)"" is what goes with the workbook. The one called ""Student CD-ROM Program Part 1 fuw Destinos (CD-ROM)"" does NOT go with the workbooks. It is a separate, optional program that gives little tests and that kind of thing.I ended up getting the latter when I thought I was getting the former, and I was very disappointed. I can't attest to the quality of the CDs with the workbook, as I haven't yet gotten them. But the CD program is nearly worthless. The questions are dumb, and the program is poorly designed.Amazon needs to fix its broken links pronto."
2,Better options out there,It is kind of cheap and it doesn't really shoot that well. I would recommend going to Home Depot and getting some 1/4 pvc pipe with an angled fitting (for your kids mouth) and then shooting tiny marshmallows. The kids had so much more fun with those and I was able to make around 5 of them for under $5. The kids tossed the one I bought from Amazon and went for the pvc pipes.
3,these songs are all familiar,"ok...i give, these songs are all sweet trance antehms but i have one problem...these songs are on every album i have. some of the mixes are new, which makes it enjoyable to listen to. i want an album with more creativity and different songs. listen to a sasha and digweed album...or sasha's ibiza global underground and you won't recognize anything."
3,"Good, but not the best map puzzle...","This is a fairly good map puzzle that our child enjoyed playing with. The New England states, VA-WV, PA-NJ-MD-DE are clubbed together into one piece. Perhaps there's no way to make them separate given the relative size of those states. The inlay printing with outline of states and names of state capitals were not perfectly aligned."
5,Great fun for Grandchild,"This wooden puzzle is quite durable. Only one complaint is that the tip of the color can separate from the base of the puzzle piece when handled by young hands. However, it is a great learning tool for recognition of state shapes, names, and capitals. My four-year-old grandchild is learning about the states and information pertaining to the state which I explain when each piece is put into its proper place (like birthplace of family members, what particular traits are relevant to the state like lakes, mountains, desert, etc.). My grandchild loves it."
1,Woodshop Toys U.S. map puzzle,"I would not suggest ordering this product. I believe it was on backorder when I ordered it, but not sure. We still have not received it yet, so I am not sure if it is a good product or not."
3,Not For Tom Tom Model 910,"I purchased the charger based on Amazon's recommendation that others who purchased a Tom Tom 910 GPS, also purchased the charger. When I received the Tom Tom model 910, I found that a home charger was included with the GPS. When I returned from my European trip, I tried to return the unit to Amazon for credit but found that Amazon would not accept returns after 30 days. Now I'm stuck with an extra home charger."
2,A rather unusual tea experience.,"I got two bags of this tea in a Tazo tea sampler box.Brewing it, it smells pretty intense. Drinking it, it tastes pretty intense. A very strong sour citrus flavor, coupled with an inexplicable slightly gelatinous texture. After a few sips I decided that I did not care for it as it was, and added some powdered non-dairy creamer to the mix, to see if that improved anything.The creamer did not dissolve well in the tea, but rather, it coagulated into little clumps, making the already-odd texture of the tea even more odd, and not improving the flavor in any significant way.Perhaps the moral of the story is that I do not like orange-flavored tea, but I found this particular orange tea to be unpleasant beyond my expectations."
5,My all-time favorite tea,"It's wintertime and there's nothing better than a hot cup of tea on a cold winter's day. Tazo's ""Wild Sweet Orange"" has been a favorite tea of mine for almost 10 years now. I first got a sip of Tazo when we lived in Portland, OR and I learned from the natives that a hot cup of tea from a local vendor was better than a pair of gloves to keep you warm. I still love ""Wild Sweet Orange"" especially with just a hint of cinnamon to pick up the flavor."
3,"It works, but...","The charger works, but the battery doesn't seem to last as long as when I use the Canon charger. I use it in a pinch, but I went in search of another Canon charger after receiving this product and seeing the result."
3,Strange design,"The unit has an odd design, the pocket for the battery is much larger than the battery and the battery does not lock in place, kind of hangs loosely. Does the job though."
2,its worth its price,"So it wasn't the easiest charger to use, but for the price, i guess you can't complain too much. first time i put the battery in, it didn't even charge. i guess the size wasn't very exact so the tips of the electrode never touched? but it worked the second time round when i placed tape over the battery to keep it in place. but it was cheap. and that's what i wanted just in case i lose it while travelling."
1,It just didn't work.,"I plugged it into the wall, put my exhausted battery in, and it glowed green, right away, like the battery was fully charged. It just didn't work, so I returned it."
5,A Must Read,"In a sea of thousands of self-help books this is one that really stands out. Without reverting to psycho-babble or self importance, best selling author Stephen Pollan gives practical, inspirational and user friendly advice and motivation that breaks down the walls of self doubt. A book you will want to read and keep around for advice and guidance as you pursue a more rewarding existance."
5,"Practical Advice, Inspirational Writing","The practical advice, which you can find in the exercises and building blocks, is what makes this terrific book stand out from the crowd. It's about more than just dreaming, as the crisp, inspirational writing here shows. Pollan and Levine have inspired me to go out and try that career in acting after all."
1,Waste of good talent,"With all the top name actors in this movie, it was very bad acting. This movie had the potential to be great, but it definitely fell short. I love Ron Perelman but his acting was terrible in this. It was not worth the $3.99 I paid to watch it."
3,Not as bad as I had heard,"OK, it was not great either. But, we are talking about a direct to DVD second sequel to a failed franchise where the first movie was pretty lousy. I mean, don't expect great acting, or incredible plots, or fantastic dialog. However, the special effects, settings, and costumes were not as cheap as I expected and it was a fun romp if you like silly sword and sorcery movies. There were several well known actors and if you were expecting the Rock, well, you got Batista (Dave Bautista) instead.After watching it I had laughed and liked enough of the scenes not to regret spending $3 on it, so I was happy."
1,The Scorpion King 3,"This has to be the worst film of my collection. The acting is so wooden, the stunts are anything but thrilling. The dialogue is so wooden and cheap, that the writers should be beaten with thier manuscripts. I have always been a fan of Ron Perlman's, but this time, no way. this isn't even a ""B"" movie, more like an ""F"" for faailure."
2,TV Pilot on a small budget,"Can you say a made for TV Pilot on a small budget, I can't believe I waited a year for this to come out."
5,Sweet Dreams My L.A. Ex. single,"""Sweet Dreams My L.A. Ex."" was Rachel's first single and it went to #2 in the UK. It is a brilliant song, one of the best ever and it was written by Cathy Dennis who also wrote Britney's ""Toxic"" and Kylie's ""Can't Get You Out of My Head"". The single features ""Sweet Dreams My L.A. Ex."" and ""Little Secret"". Both are included on the album Funky Dory. Also included in the remix which is fun. The video is the gem of this whole disc. It is sexy and sophisticated, don't pass it up!"
1,Bad Deal,I thought that they would send a paper copy all I got was an email. Will never get a plan again.
1,This book doesn't exist,There's no such thing as Absolute Sandman by Brian Azzarello. This is a Neil Gaiman book from the 90s. Azzarello certainly wasn't writing any comics in 1980. Why is there a listing for a book that doesnt exist?
4,Class project,"We used this book for a class project. After we had read the book, we watched the movie and made comparisons. Sad story about never being content."
3,missing a part,the game was missing one of the players so i took a player from a barbie game it works even a redneck would like the substatute
2,Not much there for the price!,We returned this product as my wife and I felt that there was too small an amount of product for the price.
5,The Foundation Of Folk,"Make yer best claims about who's been the most influential artist in folk music. But if you're realistic and serious, either at the top or pretty-damn-close will be Dave Van Ronk. Here are 19 superlative reasons why. Rediscover the depth and emotion simple music can evoke. Or if you're uninitiated, you won;t find a better jumping-in point anywhere.And anyone who sez it's possible to name the best tracks on this CD obviously needs to listen just a touch longer to every one of 'em. Top-notch start to finish."
1,Not worth it,"Wescott made so many basic mistakes in his translation of the Hebrew of the Sefer Yetzirah that the only reason to buy this book is to laugh at him. Even to this day, one of his mistakes is taken as a 'sacred mystery' within Hermetic magic when in truth it's just a mistranslated word."
4,Good,The book arrived on time and is what I nexpected. The service is excellent and I would use it again.
5,Crazy and original scifi grind,"Razorback Records strikes again with another killer release! Gigantic Brain might technically fall into the obscure ""Cyber Grind"" catagory, but they stand twitching antenna and shoulders above the rest of their peers. Really killer and original guitar playing, blast beat drum machine craziness mixed with moody and cool slower beats, plus really odd keys that give the whole thing an awesome sci-fi bent. The songs are of course the usual hyper-A.D.D. length typical of grinddcore, but they do not all blur together like most of the ""60 songs on one cd"" type grind bands do. Combined with really hilarious song titles and amazing cover art/packaging, this is a must for fans of original yet still extreme underground metal and industrial music. Pop in the cd, crack a beer, throw Galaga on your PS2 and blast off with GIGANTIC BRAIN!"
1,this thing sucks,"This thing didn't even work. I contacted the manufactuarer, and they won't do anything about it! Don't waste your money or your time with this. I will never buy from this company again. You shouldn't either."
5,Mile in Her Shoes,"This is a fantastic album! The lead guitarist is especially awesome, and talented both on guitar and in lyrics. I especially enjoyed ""Sundance"", which is all instrumental, a real showpiece for Drew, and the instrumentals on ""Romeo and Juliet"". ""Won't Give Up"" is a strong piece, sincere, energizing, excellent lyrics. This group definitely is bound for the spotlight in Rock and Blues."
4,MMM,"I have tried many Tazo and this was a similar to a stronger Lotus. one thing to keep in mind is to not let it sit, otherwise it becomes strong and the next time that you add water to it, the flavor is bland."
1,"Three words-Hor, ri, ble!!","I actually don't have this single, but I've heard the song and seen the music video on TV a couple of times.Maria Mena is a HORRIBLE singer! She doesn't even sing, she just says the words to some music. It's HORRIBLE! Whoever gave her a record deal must've been pretty out of it. She doesn't deserve one, because she can't sing, even if her life depended on it.Take my advice, and don't buy this single, cause most likely, you're going to be disappointed."
1,The worst of the worst,"This is the biggest load of crap I have ever listened to. Maria Mena is no singer--she only speaks. Not only does she not sing, she also has a horrible voice to begin with.This CD sounds like it was recorded by a contestant on the WB Superstar USA 2004. If you don't believe me, listen to CD! Make sure to keep your receipt so you can take it back!"
2,Works on Broad leaf Plants. Not so much on grass,Works on Broad leaf Plants. Not so much on grass. This product has little affect on st Augustine or Bermuda grass. Best for new weeds sprouting but not if they have matured.
4,Pleasant and recommended reading (but plot could be better),"The elegant writing and the well-paced daily life of the main character in this book make for a pleasant, rewarding reading. The descriptions of places and people are very nice.It's good to learn that Ron Ely, after gracing our TVs in Tarzan stories, produced a nice written work like this.I found the plot a bit weak, and it shows especially at the end. I would have given the book 3 and a half stars, if that was possible."
3,daughter,used it also for my daughter and she loved it.. it was a good time to spend teaching her with this book
3,The Story Is Good,"I have seen this many years ago a number of times. However, the""treatment"" of Johnny's future wife by her father is a little harsh andoutdated for our time. It has a good moral but the treatment of womenis kind of from the past."
2,yep its ok,"Coming from a 16 year old girl that has to read this book for a school project...I would have to say that this book is kind of boring. If your into physics and science and all that jazz then you will most likely enjoy this book. But if you're going to read it just to read it, then I would suggest you not. I have to admit, that some of the stuff Richard Feynman says is funny but I found my self skipping pages at a time because of its boringness. Don't get me wrong, I really do admire Mr. Feynman as a man and he was a great physicist but this book was just ok. Sometimes he got into a lot of in-depth physics stuff that I just didn't care for. But sometimes i was interested in what he was saying.Have a nice day"
4,The Fascinating Mr. Feynman,"A fascinating foray into the fun yet formidable physics of Mr. Feynman. Actually, this book is less about physics and more about the life of Nobel Prize Laureate, Richard Feynman. (Richard just rolled over in his grave; if you want to know why -- read this book!) Once I adjusted my expectations from education to entertainment, I absorbed every word. He was always interesting, at times very entertaining and despite his obvious genius he had an utter lack of pretentiousness and conceit that I previously assumed afflicted all venerated scientists. I left this book wishing for more, and feeling inspired to pursue my own adventures in curiosity. What could I achieve if, like Richard, I abandoned my Western culture imperative of accomplishment through suffering and played with my talents in ways I felt was fun?"
5,Loved this book,"Fantastic book of short life stories. I am not a ""physics"" guy but all these tales, even the ones with hard core science, were easily accessible. The writing style is fantastic and you really get to know the author so well. He was a great writer, scientist, and human being. Some of the way he deals with his personal life are... odd -- but it only adds to his quirky scientist persona."
4,Not all physicists are labcoat wearing nerds,"A lighthearted romp of entertaining stories that let you know that even brilliant scientists are human. Feynman's egotistic attitude gets annoying for time to time, but I suppose he was entitled to this other ""quirk"" in his multi-faceted personality. Very good supplemental reading for any serious student of science to remind them not to take life too seriously."
4,I can't belive this guy,Well he is not a good writer but he can tell a good story and o boy dose he have sum.The story was really good and I like the side remarkI didn't like that at the last quarter of the book the story goes back and foreword in time (a pain to keep track of the story line)But all and all a really good book!
4,"Nicely written, fun and easy to read","Richard Feynman's account of his own life portrays him as a fun-loving person and a good story-teller. Never shy to expose and explain his (analytical) thoughts and feelings, it gives great insight in to his 'thinking machinery'. The chapters of his work on the Manhattan project (in Los Alamos) probably have some historical relevance, although is account is mostly about how he entertained himself cracking the safes of his colleagues.There are no really controversial or unexpected revelations in the book. It is an easy read about a succesful life of a man with a love for physics, practical jokes, art, music and women."
4,Thank you Mr Ofey,"Mr Feynmann has shown us that while it pays to be good at what you do, life is far more interesting if you poke your nose into things you know little of. There are people who complain about how boring life is. Mr Ofey has shown us that the joy of discovering things can keep us young forever. I am sure if he lives to a thousand years old he will still be the same curious character we all love. Like most who read this book, I am sad that we can no longer enjoy his antics. This book changed my life."
4,Enjoyed,I heard about Richard Feynman from serval other books and a Ph.D. friend. It more thank lived up to my expectations.
4,1/2 price,Was very pleased. I purchased this paper for 1/2 the price from Amazon than I usually pay from the paper company.
3,Nice Book,I have not read the book since it is part of a series and I have not finished the others. I bought it used and the condition of the book is fine as it was a library book from somewhere. It has the classic library clear cover to keep the jacket in good condition.
5,the most basic book available,This is the most basic biology book you can find. This is more a book for personal enrichment.
2,Tangled,"The product matches my hair color perfectly, but it tangles so easily that it's impossible to wear. The cap is also very large on my big head."
5,The Best Tea,"I have tried many teas in my life , & this by far has gone over the top with me ... I have tried 4 different flavors , all of which were very satisfying. The one I liked best is Tazo Chai , it has a spice flavor that just captivates the taste buds . It may not be for every one , but since I like the taste & smell of exotic spices , this does very well for me . I will buy it & keep it on hand as much as possible.."
5,Thanks alot,I will use these inks again. I see no difference from OEM/Canon inks. Photo printing come out just fine. Thanks again.
3,family kayak,"It looks like a real kayak. It is rather fast and does not side tracks much. The complete set is skimpy: no paddles, no pump, no backbone, and no frame deck. In my opinion the backbone or something like this is absolutely necessary as otherwise the kayak just folds in the centre like an air mattress. It also says somewhere in the description that there are 3 layers in this boat to protect from drowning. This applies only to main inflation chambers. There is only one layer on the bottom. Otherwise, so far so good. I tried the kayak with 2 little guys, 5 and 4 year old. We could all fit in this boat comfortably and had lots of fun."
1,Worked well for 2 weeks then bad streaking,Worked well for 2 weeks then bad streaking.I thought I was out of the woods but after 2 weeks this will need to be replaced.I will replace this locally.
4,italian music rock.... great CD,Negrita are next generation best rock band i ever listened to... really try to believe..
2,"Good pan, poor handle construction.","Beautiful pan, with excellent heat-conducting properties. Unfortunately, the handle fell off after the third use, making this a very expensive (and not so convenient) casserole pan."
5,Rise and Fall of the Third Reich,"This is a fascinating account of Adolf Hitler's rise from obscurity to power. It is amazing how he hoodwinked a whole nation into believing that he would be their Messiah! What is surprising is not that he fell from grace to grass, but that he became the most powerful man in Europe!The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich"
3,there are other vineyards in countries outside of the states,"If you are not American this book is not for you. Although informative regarding basic wine knowledge, the book fails to give an accurate picture of the wine 'world'. The book should be renamed The Everything American wine book."
4,Overall great toy and fun,"Quick to learn, fairly quick to play, and fun, so kind of an ideal casual game.On the negative side, the pieces seem kind of flimsy; better weighting would definitely help. Perhaps they'll make a collectors edition with cast iron pieces! (not likely) Also, believe it or not, the game can be a little loud. I've noticed that when my wife is playing it in the living room while I'm watching TV it can be more than a little distracting. The sound of hollow plastic moving on plastic I guess!"
4,A MIND THINKING GAME,THE ONLY PROBLEM WITH THIS GAME IS THE STORAGE PROBLEM. THEY SHOULD OF HAD A CLEAR COVER TO SNAP ON OR SNAP CLOSE. SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO SAVE THE BOX FOR STORAGE. END
5,A big hit,Everyone loves this game! My daughter said there is even an app for it (?) I'm glad I bought it. My 7 year old can do the beginner cards with no problem!
5,Among the Greatest Chamber Music Releases on CD,"How could this be out of print? It's for sure one of the great chamber music releases ever put on CD. Sweet sound, committed passionate playing, idiomatic and spacious phrasing."
1,Southern cook book of fine old dixie recipes,The print in this cook book on the Kindle is too small to read you can notadjust the print. Please tell me how I can get this corrected or to adjust my account. The title is Southern cook book of fine old dixie recipes.
5,Fun to play,"Complete Piano Rags is a great book to play from. Any pianist of modest ability should get great enjoyment from these pieces once they figure out the syncopation. Ragtime is a great crowd-pleaser, too. Complete Piano Rags also shows the covers from the original sheet music for the rags, which are amusing in some cases. Like every other Dover edition, this book is a good value at a low price, and won't fall apart through use. The only thing this book doesn't have that I wish it did is Joplin's ""Solace: a Mexican Serenade,"" which isn't a rag, but is still very beautiful (can be heard on one of J. Rifkin's records). If you do buy this book, I recommend playing ""The Magnetic Rag,"" and ""The Fig Leaf Rag."" ""Elite Syncopations"" has a cool ending section, too."
5,good complete must have score,"With very brief basic introduction to rags.By practicing these short representative phrases, it made me easy to play Joplins score for the first time."
2,Nice shaver but poor shavin arond the mouth and chin,"The shaver is compact, quick charging and efficient however I experienced a big problem in that it wasn't very good at shaving the hair around my mouth, upper lip and chin Neck etc was very quick and through. However, it took a lot of effort to get the hair around the upper lip and actually caused some nasty breakouts. I've been using the thing about 2 months and no matter what I do--the breakouts reoccur and it's mostly due to the extra effort required to get a good shave on the upper lip."
2,Description not accurate,"I love the novelist, and I love her short stories, but when I bought the book it was claimed to be 'like new'. When I received it, it had pen markings all across the inside and many many annotations. This was a present for someone else, so as it stood I could not give it away.The good was that it shipped quickly and arrived very quickly."
1,One Of The Worst Singers ever,This is a Bad Joke.How dare He do Little Richard's Tutti Frutti?or Fats Domino's Ain't that a Shame?He has always been like a bad Vegas Lounge Act.What a Joke?
5,Long Term Relief,"I have been taking Prilosec for the past several years. It has relieved all of my discomfort from acid reflux and heartburn. If I miss just one day, I find the symptoms coming back within 24 hours. I have never taken the prescription medications like this over-the-counter medication, but I can't imagine getting any better relief."
4,"Works great, but proceed with caution","I am one in the opinion that Prilosec is over-used. Don't get me wrong, the product works wonders, but for most people it's not treating the cause of acid reflux and for others it's not even necessary. Unfortunately some people unwittingly take it more than 14 days and when they stop they suffer from a rebound effect. The body begins secreting even more acid than before the medication was taken, which may lead to a dependency. Rebound effects usually last about 2 months, but they can be excruciating. The long-term effects of taking Prilosec is what concerns me, so developing a dependency on the drug is something that should be avoided. This, for many, creates a problem even bigger than the one encountered before.I say if you want heartburn relief, make lifestyle changes. Eat a healthy diet and start exercising. Prilosec is a great product, but it shouldn't really be used for just anyone who wants heartburn/reflux relief."
3,There's a better and less expensive product available,"It's calledZegerid Capsule, 42-count Package. It contains the same active ingredient as Prilosec, but it also contains a buffering agent that causes your body to utilize the active ingredient more efficiently. Highly recommended."
4,surprisingly works very well!,"i've had heartburn for a few years, and after using this (not every day but every day i can remember I would take one), my heartburn seemed to fade off. I've taken other anti-heartburn meds before, but moreso short-term, immediate stuff like tums, and rancidine. This worked exactly as described on the box. Ultimately, I need to lose weight which will drastically reduce heartburn as I age, but until I get there, this does the trick."
1,Prilosec,Works wonders. I have tried them all over the years and none can compare with the effectiveness pf Prilosec. I constantly watch for sales on this item. Amazon is my number one source.
5,Great Product,"Last year I had several stomach problems. Although I take 2 different prescribed medicines, I also take one Prilosec every day. I think it works better than the generic presciption of Omeprozale that I used to take. It doesn't work instantly like Pepcid, it isn't supposed to. It prevents your acid pumps from working, Pepcid neutralizes the acid once it's there. It is a great thing for me! And when Amazon has it on sale it's an even better thing :)"
5,was as described,"It was as described .Fast Shipping, also.Was also labled ""Not for individual sale"", so someone made some money off of something that they got for free."
2,Wrong product,Ordered prilosec and received prevacedOh well. No time to return product. Wonder now if there was a price difference ?Btw prevaced doesn't work as well as prilosec for me
1,disappointed,"I am disappointed, since I still have not received the product. Where is it?I am disappointed, since I still have not received the product. Where is it?"
3,Good but not great,"An interesting but kind of far-fetched story line. Definitely not in the same league as Clancy's ""RED STORM RISING"". I enjoyed reading it the first time but would probably not re-read it."
1,this book is out of date,"I think that most of schaum's series are out of date. In particular, Schaum's ""abstract algebra"" is not an exception. I bougut this book to prepare my course, Abstract Algebra 1. But this book was full of stuff which is not relevant to the subject. For example, it deals in matix and boolen algebra, which are excluded in most of Alstract Algebra courses in universities. And it doesn't contains stuff about Galois' Theory. Galois' theory can be called the aim to learn Abstract Algebra. I cannot help confessing that to read this book is to waste time. It would confuse you rather than help. You cannout build the outline of Abstract Algebra with this book. I think that it is becase this book was too old-fashioned."
5,Very happy with purchase,"Very well made, easy to use on a gas stove. Wooden handles are very good too. Shipped very fast and packed well"
2,Not Enough Trucks,"We excitedly bought this video for our construction truck-loving 22 month old son. The video starts off great, showing loaders and other earth movers, but then it starts showing waaaay to many workmen and equipment operators and my son immedidiately loses interest. The video digresses away from trucks even further at the end where it spends 5 minutes talking about hot-air balloons and ducks. I just purchased I Love CAT Machines part 3 and hope to get more of what my son my son wants... scenes of construction trucks, rather than a 10 minutes of construction footage stretched into a dopey 27 minute video that loses his attention."
5,Who would think a simple video would be such a hit!,"We borrowed this video from the library a week or so ago. It came time to return it and my son had a fit. We had to renew the loan from the library. Now, I'm online buying a copy.The video is good. The narrartion is perfect for the 18 months to 3 yrs group. My son (2.5 yrs) sits and repeats the narration, which is done mostly by a young boy - probably 8 to 10. When the songs start up, my son is up and dancing like a wild man!Good video. Very education and it will probably be the death of my VCR as it's watched at least twice a day in my house."
1,Misprinted Book,"I purchased this book at Christmas as a gift for my son. I noticed today, when we finally got around to reading it, that the book is a misprint. It starts off with pages 1-16, then starts over with a duplicate of pages 1-16 and then jumps to pages 33-48. Pages 17-32 are missing. Too late to return it without having to pay for the return. Not sure it's worth taking the time to send it back for a partial refund. Wish there was an easier way to just exchange it for a complete book. I guess I should have checked the book sooner."
1,boring!,Didn't like it and won't recommend to my friends. We all box and train and most of this book is not true!
2,Cheap fragile screen in front,"I still do not know what happened, but one minute the screen on the outside front cover was working, the next minute it was cracked so now there are ink blots. I only had it for 3 days before this happened and I know it was not dropped. I only paid $20.00 for it but would definitely NOT pay any more for it. Otherwise, it works fine."
5,Fun little phone,"I just upgraded my phone to the V180 great little phone with fun features. Yes the phone's screen could be a little bit bigger. But it's really simple to use. And I found a great website for more wallpapers and ringtones! I would recommend it. I have T-mobile service now, maybe the previous ppl that have had problems with this phone should go to a new carrier."
1,underwater conversations,"I have this as a replacement for my Samsung e-105 which was a fantastic little phone that I never had a problem with, until my lack of care caused it to finally collapse. Phones (other than Nokia, IMO) only last about 14 months these days.I have no complaints about the design - the LCD is not NEARLY as clear as the samsung, and it is cheap plastic, but it's free - what should I expect?The problem is that every conversation - whether to a landline or another mobile - sounds like the other person is under water! They're garbled and hard to understand. I always have to ask people to repeat themselves.Second problem - the battery. After an hour, even when not in use, it needs more juice.I already called TMobile and ordered the next Samsung - their interface is considerably better.(and any problems with TMobile might just be from the particular agent - i've never had a problem, and I've been with them for 6 years - since they were Voicestream!)"
2,The main character is trash,"I finished this book last week. It was a well-written book, and the story line was solid, but I think Franzen's main character was meant to be portrayed as an all-around good guy deep down, but in reality I think he was a scoundrel. [Semi-spoiler alert] He cheated on his wife for two months during the war and had a love child, and his utter lack of compassion for his wife when he breaks the news to her of his lies is nauseating. He essentially told her having an affair with another woman and an illegitimate child was the one good thing that came out of the war. And what's even more disgusting is that his wife actually apologizes to him when her reaction to this news wasn't received with enthusiasm, and he actually accepts her apology! Unbelievable. I found myself disliking Tom Rath's character every bit as much as Holden Caulfield's character in Catcher in the Rye. Just my two cents."
3,Just Okay,"The new girl on the block has Agatha Raisin in a jealous flutter--until something terribly nasty happens. This murder mystery is as snug and cozy as Agatha's quaint English village, though the mystery itself isn't too interesting. A little too light and silly for my taste, but plenty of interesting and memorable Britishers."
4,My favorite of the Agatha Raisins so far.,"It's the third in the series, and Agatha's becoming a little more likable. Or I'm just getting more used to her. Anyway, the charming little village is developing a real sense of place, and the town and its personalities are fun to go back and visit. It rather compares with the ""Cat Who"" books in this sense. But James is a wuss -- what does she continue to see in him? I'm ready to visit the next book!"
3,It wasn't Her Best But I like It,I enjoy the premise of the novel. Even thought I pretty much knew who the murderers were. I still enjoy it. The only thing I didn't like because constant conflict between Josette and Marc. She already knew in her heart she forgive him and knew she want him. It was so distracting to the storyline the constant conflict but it was good.
3,Admin.,"This book is was good, but is was long and drawn out. At one point I had to put it down read the one on his sister to try and link them together, then read it. The one reason I will keep this in my library is that i like to link Characters from different books and see how they come alive in their own novels"
3,Interesting but flawed,"If you suspend disbelief and see this book as fantasy it is veye enjoyble read. I agree with some of the ideas in the book the others are just to much out there. The main fault of the book is some very improbable twists and main character who is to much of a ""white hat"""
3,Good but not great.,"I was very excited for this album. I really enjoyed Unkle's rebore vol. 1, I loved Vision Creation Newsun and most of what Eye touches turns to gold, so I had pretty high hopes. On the first few listenings I REALLY enjoyed this album. Eye avoids a lot of the pitfalls of remixing, choosing to literally remix the original tracks, switching them around, altering speeds, and generally making new and interesting things out the VCN material. I still think it is very good, much better than most crap out right now, but taking the ($) price into account, I don't think it's worth it. I think VCN was a much better overall album, with many of the same sounds. This one is a album to relax to, not the amazing journey that VCN was. For boredoms completists only,"
1,boring!!!,"No actual thinking is involved, only rote memorization of boring facts. Too many cards in a cumbersome size."
3,Mouse Trap - made by Milton Bradley,"In this hi-tech age,I'm amazed a game like Mouse Trap is even made anymore.Don't get me wrong,I liked this game as a kid but that was over thirty years ago.I recently picked this game up and I found out the hard way that most kids over the age of,say eight probably wouldn't have much interest in it.The recommended age is over three.So,that would narrow it down to kids between 3 to 7.If you're an adult with some time on your hands,you could possibly find this game somewhat entertaining for maybe twenty minutes before wanting to find something else to do.Only downside is that too many of the required pieces can easily end up lost or broken.Overall,it's an okay game."
2,MOUSE TRAP game not worth buying,"This game is a pain!!! You have to build a piece of the contraption with each play. It takes forever, it falls apart easily, and it's just not fun. My 6 year old thinks it's fun at the end when you actually get to make the contraption work, but most kids (and parents) would not have the patience to sit through the game to build it!"
2,It's All Relative!,"This was a favorite 'family' game my siblings remember playing with our parents. It always did and still does take a while to get the hang of building it and keeping it together during play. This is not a bad thing; my siblings and I learned a lot about 'patience', and remember all the parts and pieces to the game quite foundly -- Although none of us remember the objective of or rules to the game. Adults who don't have time won't like this, but remember it's all relative -- think like a kid."
2,Neither fun nor interesting,"My son (age 6) wanted this game for a long time, and was thrilled when he got it as a birthday present. Unfortunately, the box doesn't clearly explain that building the mousetrap is part of the game, and that the mousetrap cannot be built by an ordinary child with ordinary motor skills, let alone by a pre-reader. Once the trap is built, it doesn't stay together and doesn't always work. On the bright side, my autistic 4 y.o has had great fun playing with the mousetrap."
3,OK Game....,"The game is OK...The object of game is to trap the opponents mouse. But here is the catch...you have to go around the board and bulid the trap first. The pieces, although very colorful..are not color coded...so this can be a bit confusing. For each piece of the trap that you build...you get a piece of cheese...throughout play you can steal cheese from your opponent, or pay pieces of cheese to set your opponent up to get trapped! Cute game...they say to get rid of all bags that the game pieces come in...there are a lot...but my advice is to replace those bags with Ziplocks and do it quickly!! Must have patience when playing this game...especially when putting it together!!!!"
2,Good Game (If I could understand it!),This game seems like it would be fun but it is hard to get the hang of. All of the pieces are hard to figure out where they go and the directions are kind of hard to understand. I guess with some time and some patients this is a fun and durable game.
3,"Attractive, yes. Fun? Well not so much actually.","I pestered and bugged my family for weeks about this one. I wanted it BAD, what with all the little pieces and stuff which were so cute and unique! They finally gave in, and it was a very excited me who dumped the content of the box on the floor. After struggling to mount it (my favourite part) I finally was ready to play the game... and it was boring. I must have played it maybe once or twice tops, then it went back into its box were it still is collecting dust."
1,Junk!,"My 4 year old saw this on t.v and had to have it.My parents never bought it for me when I was a kid,now I know why.It takes forever to set up and evey time you just tap the game the trap falls and you have to reset it.DON'T waste your money!"
3,broken parts,"Game came quick and new in plastic. We finally opened it and played. Mousetrap is a lot of work with a 4 year old, but worth that moment of truth where the trap falls on the mouse. We were finally there and.....what happened!! One of the plastic attachments necessary to make the trap fall was broken. :( O well, we were able to replace it with a part from our old mousetrap game so we didn't have to go through the hassle of returning through the mail. I'm sure this isn't a routine thing, at least i hope it isn't. we just happened to get one with a broken part. Other than that its the same old game of mousetrap we have been playing for years!"
5,A classic,A classic. Kids love it. They even love playing it by themselves just to run the gizmo.Buy it. I haven't met a kid yet who doesn't like this game.
2,Not worth the money or time,"This should be a great game, and is hindered by only one thing: the mouse trap contraption rarely works as it should. My daughters and I have set it and re-set it up several times in hopes we will get to see each device work properly, but several do not, especially the board held up by the hand.I would not spend your money on this, but if you do, good luck getting it to work."
2,Not made like is used to be!,Was difficult to get assembled and once assembled didn't work too well. Parts were cheap flimsy plastic. Not how I remembered it when I was a child.
1,parents' nightmare,"this game comes in many little pieces and has to be put together before the kids can play, then taken apart, put together, and so on. The pieces don't fit well, they get lost, and your kids will need you to put it together for them , but after the first time you'll suggest they play something else! I finally threw it all away. What a relief."
3,man went in the pan,had this game as a kid. never got it to work right today got it to work three times in s roe
3,Not like I remembered,"I don't remember mousetrap being so laborious when I was a kid! I'm sure it's the same game now as it was 20 years ago, but parents be warned: you will be sitting through hours of complicated board setup (which require reading skills). My son loves it, but I have to admit I try to avoid it unless I am absolutely finished with all of my other daily duties and can afford to commit the time it takes to complete the game."
4,DVD Verdict Bill Gibron says.....,"here's the review from DVD Verdict's Bill Gibron.""this effort shows promise, not problems, for everyone involved. DJ Naylor and Mark Mench are actors to watch, and if he ever gets his game totally together, Anghus Houvouras could be a genuine journeyman filmmaker. 20 Funerals may merely be a resume builder, but there's more here than future possibilities. It is a thoroughly watchable genre offering."""
4,"""A Girl Like You"" 2nd CD","""A Girl Like"" is a very gentle turn from ""Music of The Sun."" Which was a feel good album. ""A Girl Like Me"" is very sensual and soft. I think it is her most vulnerable album. This album doesn't try to make her seem like the victim, but it shows how she can hurt others as well as be hurt when it comes to love and relationships. This album has some up beat tracks, but it is really a cd to show her more exposed side. My favorite song has to be ""PS (Still Not Over You)."" While as for a up tempo song i would suggest ""Break It Off"" b/c her together with Sean paul is to die for. Yet, and still i really enjoyed this album. And if you want to really appreciate Rihanna's work of today you will have to dive to her roots. Once you get pass the first 3 albums the next 4 are a special treat. Her evolution is extremely unique and even though she switches it up she sticks to that Rihanna edge and sex appeal."
1,"Good only to dance to, so Unfaithful is horrible.","I don't understand why ""Unfaithful"" was chosen as the single. She's just a dance act. Pon De Replay and SOS were songs popular only because of the mixes and remixes. When it came ballad time in ""Unfaithful"", she had a voice that squeals like a dying animal. If this really happened, I feel sorry for the guy she was unfaithful to."
2,This Album Is Average- Nothing New Here,"This girl hasn't even been out for a year and she already has a second album out. Somebody's 15 minutes of fame are about to be up. Anyway, this album is average at its best and it's just all over the place like her last album- pop, R&B, reggae, club. I already wrote a review on ""SOS"" and, like I said, Rihanna brings nothing new. I thought ""Crazy Little Thing Called Love"" was a remake of Queen, but it's not. ""Break It Off"" with Sean Paul was kind of weak. Other than that, the best songs on the album were ""We Ride"" and the remix of""If It's Lovin' That You Want""- the rest is just forgettable filler material. Rihanna needs to work on her vocals because sometimes her voice sounds warbly and shaky, like she's crying or something. And Rihanna has beaten Sade and The Brain hands down."
4,Cookbook review,Great cookbook. Have used some of the recipes. Have high cholesterol and wanted resource for recipes with lower cholesterol ingredients.
1,Bad Trimmer,"I was given this trimmer as a gift. I would never recommend buying it. First of all, the attachments do not provide consistent lengths on your beard. If you change, even slightly, the angle you are holding the trimmer, you also change the length of the beard you are trimming. Second, the small trimmer does not work for me at all. It won't cut my beard. I have a thickish beard, but I've met plenty of people with thicker, I guess its only for 14 year olds. The large trimmer works well, but its attachment doesn't cut short enough for the beard that I - and most people not named Santa - am going for."
1,Deceptive seller......,"I was so excited expecting to see my Remington PG350, to my GREAT disappointment I receivedPG250 instead. I had paid for the PG350 model instead the seller sent me the PG250 model which is cheaper than what I paid for. I am very very very upset with these deceptive sellers. No explanation was indicated in the package. I cannot write a review on the PG350 cause I never got it. Shame on you deceptive sellers!!!!!!"
1,Very Cheap!!!,"I was actually surprised to see another review saying good things about this product.When I went to use it after letting it charge up, none of the heads would work except for the nose trimmer. On most of them, the blades would move at first, but as soon as they hit one hair, they stopped.I wasn't expecting a top quality trimmer for the price, but I was at least expecting something that basically did the job. I didn't even get that much."
2,Not very strong.,Pro:Fancy looking.Nice storage.Rechargable.Con:Not very powerful.Poor for rough beards.
1,gromming kit,"very cheap holder for this set, we had a remington set and i could not find one like it so i went with this one, very unsatified"
3,Works Well...Design Needs Improvement,"I purchased this a few years ago to replace another similar product from another company. Although the unit worked fine for me, I did not like the design of the hair trimming attachments. I thought the two hair trimming attachments were too bulky and did not let me get close enough to trim hairs near the intersections of my nose & cheeks or ear lobes and neck. Although it cut facial hair fine, I would not buy this unit again due to the design issues that I mentioned."
3,Average rating for a personal groomer,Overall I like this product. The cover for the brush and replacable heads in the storage base is a nice touch. Older models tended to collect dust and debries because the top was open. I would have rated this higher but I don't care for the way the charger plug mounts in the storage base. It seems a bit on the flimsy side and I'm not sure of the long term durability and reliability of the connection.
3,minty smell,"I really like the toy, although my husky does not. At first, she knew why we bought it; she destroyed her other football. The other football was not a dog toy; I think it was a child’s toy. It was very light, bounced when chased; not a toy to leave unattended with your pet. I searched for days to find a doggie football. I bought this one because of the reviews, non-toxic and MADE IN THE USA. Now when we play, she will go up to the ball and smell it. She does not like the minty smell therefore; we do not choose that toy to play with. It just sits out in the yard. I still recommend this product."
5,Big dogs love this toy.,I purchased two of these for dogs that are over 60 pounds to play with. Very well made and will withstand a good bit of chewing. The football even has a pleasant minty smell.
2,Horrible design!,"After resorting the 30 or 40 cards into order dozens of times, and my son who is very smart still not able to play it at age 4, I finally gave this one away to charity. Let some other parent get suckered into sorting these cards again and again!"
3,TOO MUCH WORK,I know it's a game but come on.. there are so many instructions and pieces. My daughter loves it but this game drives me crazy.. I haven't even seperated all the pieces because there are soo many. Plus the drawing part is a pain. I may be lazy about it but there are games out there that are just as fun with out the hassle. Quite disappointed.
2,"Nice, but not worth the price","The product is colorful and with interesting photoes, but not worth the price. Want to play rummy? A regular set of cards will suffice for a lot less money."
1,Not so great,"This game was a dissapointment after playing Rat A Tat Cat. I am very upset with the quality, because it requires a lot of space and time as well as understanding."
4,Guide to Mechanical Ventilation and Intensive Respiratory Ca,"I think is a good book, and provide a good aproach to many process in the intensive care. Its usseful for residents and for a quick consult.thank you, and please excuse me for may english"
5,Simon is Spectacular!,"Simon arrived at the time promised. Playing Simon brought fond memories of having played in the past. My family and I took turns and surprisingly I beat the game. Time to move to a more difficult, challenging setting. Thanks Amazon."
2,not the answer to the problem,"The product holds the trash bag from the sides in four places,2 in front, 2 in back. So far, so good. However, nothing holds the back in between these attachment points. Result? As the bag fills, it begins to gap away from the back side of the cabinet door, so that as trash is dumped in, some of it will either miss the bag completely or partially and fall onto the floor. Not good.Handi Bag Trash Bag Holder"
3,"Interesting information, poor presentation.","It has been a struggle to get very far in this book because the formatting is so poor. It is entirely style over substance. Typefaces are low contrast, thin, small, generally illegible. I guess this all started in the Nineties with books like S,M,L,XL. It's gone too far."
2,A Glorified Brochure for Gerber's Consulting Services,"This book was a real disapointment. I really enjoyed Gerber's ""E-Myth Revisited"", and I was expecting something similar in this book -- wrong. After summarily lambasting practically every management practice, he offers his solution; which was written in a ""One-minute Management"" -story style. The book was little more than an expensive promotional piece for his consulting services. It told just enough to get you interested in learning more, but there was nothing tangible that you could really take and use in your business practice. Lots of philisophical fluff -- little substance."
1,Not like the original,"If you are looking for the original emyth book that is LOADED with earth shattering ideas about how small business owners should look at their business - this is NOT it.A very dissappointing philosophical book that meanders around with little inspiring points.The emyth original is at the top of the must read books for business owners and this one might be near the bottom. Not to say that there are not some bright spots, but they are few."
4,Biz,Great stuff and a must have - appears to be simplistic but after you really study Gerber's well articulated strategy carefully - it will then reveal its true value.
5,Most Comfortable Hammock Chair Ever,"I highly recommend this hammaka chair. I have had several types over the years and this one has lasted the longest, through my harsh 100+ summers and rainy winters. It is also the most relaxing hanging chair I've ever had. You can adjust it for comfort when you first hang it up and the added foot rest makes it just awesome. I always use the cup holder to put my phone in while I'm outside. After 2 years or so, my pillow deflated and it has a leak that isn't mendable without ripping the canvase holder apart. And recently (after 3 years of constant use) some of the stitching is comming undone. But I'm back at Amazon to buy another one, because they are that good!"
4,Useful and extremely portable,"This is a fine little guide. It's close to the perfect field guide on this under-treated subject--physically small, light and reasonably complete. If your nature rambles don't stop when it gets cold, you should consider this little volume."
5,Even professionals can use help,As a certified arborist I was having a little trouble with my winter i.d. of trees. This little book has helped tremendously.
3,"4 year-old loves it, but a pain to shuffle","Our 4 year old picks up new concepts very quickly and had some trouble with understanding all of the rules to this game. We modified it so it was fun for her, but I always cringe when she wants to play because it's next to impossible to shuffle the deck - since the cards are shaped like pieces of bread. Because of this, it tends to stay in the closet and I'm looking at a few other games with rectangular cards."
1,Into the recycling bin,"I bought this game because the box looked cute and it had won two awards. What a waste of money it was! It is essentially a game of war - you scream and slam your hand on top of the pile if the cards happen to be flipped over in a certain combination (two of the same next to each other (""a double decker"") or two of the same cards on either side of a different card (""a slamwich""). There is absolutely no educational value to this game, it's just a game that will have your kids yelling and arguing about who won a particular slam."
2,Didn't work in our house,"Perhaps we introduced this game at the wrong time... but it failed miserably at our house.The cards are oddly shaped, and not sturdy, so they got torn and bent (and lost) quickly. No one seemed to enjoy playing the game, even after they understood the concept..."
4,Tough product to rate at this time,"This product did arrive in the mail, as advertised, but I haven't needed to use it."
5,Sadie is a great teacher!,"I recently purchased this DVD and - wow! This DVD is absolutely worth it! I never write reviews but I had to write one to tell everyone how excellent this DVD is.First of all, I really enjoyed the pace of the video. The DVD goes quickly and you will be burning by the middle of the video. I didn't even make it to the end of the DVD the first time! Definitely a work out and definitely not boring! The musAnd second, Sadie is a fabulous teacher. The way she explains the dance technique is very helpful! I have been taking belly dance for about 8 months and I wish Sadie could be my teacher locally! All of of a sudden I am able to do moves that I could not achieve in class.In conclusion my moves are looking great and I am feeling great. Way to go Sadie! Thank you for producing this DVD."
5,Profoundly disturbing,"This book gave me great insight into the trauma to people's lives as a result of war and the war machine. It is profoundly written and the subject is sensitively handled. I'm sure not everyone will agree with the author's view point, but it sure helped me to have better understanding for the war veterans I come in contact with."
4,Hard to Resist - But Wish it Had More,"As a big fan of Celine, of course this is a ""must have"" for my collection. But I'd say Sony should have included more on this DVD, such as music videos of songs other than just ""A New Day Has Come.""Also, the remix version of ""A New Day Has Come"" plays when viewing the photo gallery, but the slide show ends before the song goes to the end, which is a pitty! For the benefit of all Celine lovers, Sony really should think more for the consumers and add more onto this DVD."
2,Bad O ring gasket,"I found the O Ring gasket gets weak and out of shape so when you replace the cartridge and screw the cap on it gets twisted out of shape and the canister leaks all over the place!!!! I had to buy a complete new unit as I thought I did something wrong? But I have two toilets and the second one just did the same thing. So you can only replace the cartridge once or twice if your lucky, then you have to buy a whole new one... too expensive!!!!!! Beware!!!! Other wise I would use it as I think it's great, if it didn't leak!!!! My wife loves it too!"
2,"Cushing never gives less than his best, but...","Argh. Don't waste your time on this dud. It was made by Tigon, the studio that occupied third place to Hammer and Amicus in the British horror genre of the '60s. They turned out some fairly good films, but this one's lamentable. The only things I enjoyed about it were Peter Cushing, who never turned out a bad performance, and the curious casting of Robert Flemyng -- it wasn't great acting, but his natural bug-eyed features provided an ironic point of interest. The main vampire is a giant moth played unconvincingly by a stuntman in a cape. After a series of murders, Cushing identifies a handful of what look like oversized moth scales, and being a great detective, instantly solves the case: ""I think the Doctor has created a giant moth."" Well, obviously."
2,The Vampire Beast Craves Blood!,"At least that was one of the more lurid titles this picture was shown under, here in The States. Peter Cushing is a Victorian police detective investigating a bizarre series of bloody murders; Robert Flemyng is an entymologist who has somehow created a gigantic vampire moth who can masquerade as a beautiful woman. If you get past the laughable concept of a humanoid moth, the movie's not bad, and benefits greatly from Cushing's presence."
4,Excellent vintage whodunit/horror,"This is one of a few horror/whodunit movies from Hammer Studios that features Peter Cushing as a character other than Van Helsing or Frankenstein. The prmise is interesting in that it predates the interest in ""Mothman"". Of further interest is the fact that the central horror figure is a female. Alll good fun as are many of the Hammer productions."
3,"listener, not so great","it's a pretty cool toy, but not to much the listener, it blips out every 2 seconds, not great for listening to conversations. the other stuff is cool, but if you're going to buy this because of the listener, keep looking, but if you don't care about the listener, then go ahead!"
1,can you call this good?,it is not good.it is the badest toy i ever layed my hands on and a am not lying it is bad bad bad
5,Effective and easy to use,"I am an elementary School Social Worker and have used this book when working with students with Autism/Aspergers. The book is a very effective tool in helping students develop strategies for managing their emotions. I love how students can identify their emotions in their own way, using language and pictures that they create. It is very simple for clinicians to use and for students to understand."
3,ok game,My kids didn't really love this game. They play it their own way and seem to like that better but I probably wouldn't buy again.
2,Book for CLASS not Critical Thinking,"I am just very unimpressed with this book. It's like you are reading a lot but get nowhere. I'm a RN and I know I critically think. It's imperative for my profession. Maybe Nurses and the Nursing Concepts and theory puts me at a disadvantage. Maybe this book is far to fundamental for me and I find it as the book states ""goes without saying"". It more accurately creates an apparatus. This book is the closest english can get to Math. An apparatus I am never going to use in life. It's basically a take on the Scientific Method."
5,Awesome!!!!!,"Borat meets Spinal Tap and throw in some porn. Funny and disturbing, bold and idiotic. Plenty of cameos from the biggest in the biz!"
1,Not a very good movie!,"Save your money. Very poor movie. I thought it would be funny, but the acting was terrible and the whole plot just stank..."
4,"good, but","Just so you know, this kanteen only arrived with one spout, not the two as described. Otherwise we love these water jugs!!"
3,Broke in one month,"I love the Kleen Kanteen it is easy for my 1 yr old to drink from an doesnt leak. However, he is rough with it and the adapter cracked inside of one month of use...."
3,this game is ok the first three times you play,after you play this game a few tiems you realize how boring it truely is you'll have fun a few times but jsut get risk or something where the outcome isn't always exactly the same
3,$75?!!! Is this a joke?!!!,"This game is fun. It is not Amazing. It is a one play game most of the time, as in, you will play it once and then put it away till next time. It is not fun enough or big enough to play two or three times in a row For Most People.I was thinking about purchasing it and then I saw the price! Not sure what makes this a nearly 75 dollar game, but there is no way I would pay that!"
4,Great game!,"I loved this game as a kid myself, and our boys are learning to play it and seem to enjoy it as well. So glad already for the extra pieces since we had misplaced a couple on Christmas Day."
4,The new stratego is an abomination,"With this version, I was very disappointed to discoverboth the red and blue pieces are blank whenpurchased and one is required to sticka label of the officer image on each piece.Arrgh! With care, all my other Stratego pieces will last a lifetime.These pieces will only last as long as the glueon the back of this label holds up!Another disappointment: The Marshal, although still thestrongest piece, is now given a numerical 10 instead of 1.The General is now given a 9 instead of 2, etc.Ugh! Thanks a lot Hasbro! This doesn't make it any easierfor new players to grasp the concept of rank and yet is abane to the rest of us"
3,N9 works for my HP DV1000,"The N9 tip works with my HP DV1040 laptop, however is not a snug fit. This costs entirely too much for one usable tip... I wonder why they package these in twos?Works fine, just don't like having to pay for it when the adapter says it works with HPs. And you don't get two of the same tip."
5,Articstic view on Light,"Collection of pictures to study Artistic Light Aspect.Nices pictures linking with technics concepts.Too many historical, not enought up to date...But... great color pictures!"
3,"Cool Music, Bores On......","OK, This CD is pretty good, especially if u love the song, Backstreet's back, alright! But, after listening to a few tracks, it starts to get really boring..... So, if u are NOT a backstreet boyz flip-over-fan, I suggest u do not bother buying this CD. But if u are, well then, pull out your wallet and type in your credit card details......."
2,More new-agey than I wanted,"I had hoped this book would offer a no-nonsense approach to alternative remedies to common health problems. While there are some helpful sections, many of the solutions to problems involve more ephemereal suggestions than concrete ones. I expected mostly suggestions for herbs and supplements, not so much of the new-agey (or perhaps ancient?) stuff about aligning chakras, etc."
1,my preschooler does NOT like this game!,"Terrible!! I remember playing this game as a kid and really enjoyed it and so we bought it for our almost-4-year-old daughter. She loves Candyland, UNO, matching games, Old Maid, Go Fish, Sorry, etc...but really does not like this game. We gave it to Goodwill after playing one time. The board is very hard to decipher (nothing like I remember as a kid) and it's simply too boring for her. Do NOT bother with this game."
2,NOT a good toy,I got this game for my 3 year old and she and i didnt like the game at all. its also itant made well.
3,It is a pretty good game for a young (age 4-7) child.,"I've given this game to several of my nieces and nephews, and I've received rave reviews from to each child that I've given it."
1,a must for the youngster in your family,"with its easy too follow instrutons and tiny parts you can eaily teach your children how to play many exciting self-mutilating games! I feel that some of the senarios are not very good for children to follow, i.e. the child is climbing the tall tree to rescue the small kitten without the use of a safety restraint incase the child may slip. Plus, now it is a popular drinking game found at many of the local colleges so you might want to order now while they are still in stock. Furthermore, the useage of eating too much and getting a stomach ache does not sit well with most of the obese society. END"
5,Learning to count and take turns!,"We love this game, I had it when I was little and so I bought it for my kids. It's great because it doesn't matter who you play against, it is a matter of chance not skill. It teaches kids to count, take turns, and even to learn to face failure (sliding down a chute). We all play it and I've got 4 kids of different ages."
5,Excellent purchase!,"This ""old"" game is just hard to beat for teaching counting and following instructions...my daughter loves it!"
4,It's a classic!,"This is the classic Chutes and Ladders you know and love from when you were a kid. Bought this for a 4 1/2 year old boy. It was a little frustrating for him at first when he realized that getting to a chute means going backwards, but now that he's used to it, he enjoys the game. Helps him practice counting."
5,Really like a game of life!,This game can be so frustrating and exhilarating at the same time. A good representation of the game of life.
3,Abbeys first board game,I got the classic game for my 5 month old daughter. I knew it was going to be a-while before she was able to play it but it was on sale and its a classic kids game.
4,cute illustrations but difficult for pre-schoolers to play,"The best thing about this game are the graphics. Unlike many other games out there the illustrations are really adorable and astheticlly pleasing. But, like many games out there, the age grading is incorrect. The box says clearly the game is for pre-schoolers, but my 4 year old son can't possibly follow the track by himself. My 1st grade daughter is really getting a lot out of it though. Following the track to 100 is much easier for her and slightly educational as well. It's fun to play together, but Mom has to be there with the kids to help. Since I purchased the game to have something fun to do as a family, I have no problem sitting there showing my son how to count and where to put his game piece. If you want something for your pre-school age child to do independantly, then look elsewhere."
4,Kids Love It,"Well, Chutes and Ladders wasn't my favorite game as a child but I certainly enjoyed playing it. I have the ""Dora Edition."" She's a character I never heard of before purchasing it, but every kid I showed it to knew Dora the Explorer. Yes, I agree with another reviewer, the pieces are not very durable. Neither is the board for that matter but you get what you pay for and this happens to be one of the cheapest games around. Every child I played it with liked it which is an important indicator of its worth."
5,Large and heavy duty.,"I normally buy items such as this from Home Depot or Lowes so that I can see the quality and size of the product before I buy it. I was pleasantly surprised to find that this one, for a good price, was as described. As large and heavy duty as it is it is, and for less than I had paid for a smaller Stanley hinged hasp three years ago, I really got my monies worth."
1,Different problem same outcome,Bought this and originally loved how fast it brewed and how easy it was to clean. In under 6 months it fails to pump the water up thru the center tube. I have to fiddle with it to make it start brewing correctly. I've been in foodservice for 10 years and have never seen a coffee urn do this!
4,"Operation, a classic","What can you say, its a classic game. Everyone has played it at one time or another. Good game, we don't play it all the time, but we do pull it out every once in a while."
2,Too hard for kids under 7,The pieces are way too small and way too hard to get out of the spaces without making the buzzer go off. My 6 year old doesn't find anything fun at all about this game. The pieces get stuck under the game board and are almost impossible to get out. Save your money for something else.
2,my last purchase at amazon,"I couldn't possibly review this product - I ordered this ""original"" Operation game as pictured and was sent the new ""revised"" edition.I sent it back.I ordered the ""original"" as pictured Operation game again - this time I paid over $60.00 - assurred that I would get the correct game - but no, I got the new ""revised"" edition again that you can purchase at any store for $19.00.I sent it back.I will not trust Amazon again with any purchase."
1,not the game of yester-year,this game is not very much fun. the money matters little to kids. different scoring would be better. pieces are easily lost. game is made of thin cardboard. i would not reccomend this game.
1,Big Disappointment!!,"Excited that my daughter was finally old enough to play my favorite childhood game, we purchased it and rushed home to play. This is NOT the Operation I remember!! The game is cheaply constructed, and it is nearly impossible to use the tweezers. They have NO grip, so time and time again, they slip off of the part you are trying to pick up. I was successful a time or two, but my daughter was only able to retrieve the rubber band. Needless to say, she became frustrated quickly. This game is JUNK -- save your money."
2,Not like it used to be,I remember playing this game when I was a kid. I perchased it for my daughter thinking that she would have fun. Didn't happen!She hated the noise it made.(A truely disterbing and loud sound) So we Cut the wire to the sound but it didn't help. She tried to play but the pieces were lost within a week and the game hit the trash.
2,Frustrating!!!!!!!!,This game is fun at first but then it gets boring and during the game it get frustrating.
3,A cool toy,"When I was about seven my best friend who lived across the street got this for Christmas. I was so jealous. I always wanted my own but my parents wouldn't buy it for me because they thought it was dumb. Well, it is, but that doesn't mean it's not a lot of fun.The game gets a little old after awhile (at least it did for me) but the novelty of it lingers on. I've also wanted Alien autopsy for myself.If your kid wants it, hey indulge 'em. You're only a kid once."
