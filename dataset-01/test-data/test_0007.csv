3,A good basic book about the breed,"This is a good starting point for anyone interested in the breed however I do not feel it is worth the cover price. Like many other books of this nature that discuss basic breed specifics, it discusses Italian Greyhounds in a general optimistic way using glossy pages with lots of cute pictures. I would encorage any prospective owner to continue their research using other sources and not just this one."
3,Pretty book....,"This book has a very beautiful cover with great photos. It is very similar to the other IG book I bought at the same time ""Italian Greyhound (Kennel Club Dog Breed Series)by Dino Mazzanti"" . And they are almost hard to tell apart. Great if you are new to the breed, it reads quick, I wish it was longer. Out of the 2 I bought, this one seems a bit more practical."
4,Italian Greyhound: Complete Handbook,"There are very few books available for the Italian Greyhound owner - this is a very valuable book as these are very special and unique dogs. A good reference book, having wonderful photos as well."
3,GOOD MOVIE TO LOOK AT IF YOU EVER GET BORED,"TWO COPS [DOLPH LUNDGREN AND BRANDON LEE, THE DECEASED SON OF BRUCE LEE] GO AFTER THE YAKUZA IN THIS VIOLENT LIITLE MARTIAL ARTS ACTIONER. AS ALWAYS, THE ACTING IS MEDIOCRE. BUT, THE ACTION MAKES UP FOR IT. HAS LOTS OF EXPLOSIONS AND LOTS OF NUDE SCENES TO KEEP THINGS LIVELY. THIS SHOULD PLEASE MOST MARTIAL ARTS FANS."
1,yeah..whatever..doesnt add up,Lee and Lundgren partner up and take down the badguys..Lundgren gets the girl played by Tia CArerre and then kills the badyguy at the end with the help of Brandon Lee.....bad script..bad acting..though Lee gets some few good fight scenes he cant save this one from being a dud....a dud like Lundgren..Lundgren cant act is all im saying..and if you people think so..your all weird in the head...Lee's worst movie..RENT THE CROW DAMNIT!!! or at least The Legacy Of Rage
5,Brandon Lee and Dolph Lungren Together!,Amazing movie! One of Dolph's greatest roles ever! Brandon Lee brings charisma and humor to his role as well.This is a five star movie-
5,GREAT MOVIE OF ACTION,THIS MOVIE IS ABOUT TWO COPS. ONE IS A ALONE MAN WHO'S PARENTS WERE KILLED IN TOKYO BY A JAPANESE MOBSTER RIGHT IN FRONT OF HIM. NOW HE IS OUT FOR REVENGE. THESE TWO COPS ARE OUT TO CATCH THIS JAPENESE MOB AND HAVE A FUN TIME. THIS MOVIE HAS A HOT ACTRESS TIA CARRERE AND SAME AS A LOT OF OTHER GIRLS STARRING IN IT. BUY THE MOVIE TO SEE THE ACTION.
5,Haunting predictions from the late 1960's...,"Drucker shares so much knowledge about the early to mid 20th century global economic situation. He predicts the coming era of information technology. He suggests our advanced economies must shift to depend on knowledge work rather than industrial might. He explains why barriers to trade must fall in order for the most productive companies/countries to thrive. The Government's role diminishes as multinational corporations grow. Isolationism and protectionism hurt an economy in the long run. There are great concepts explained in this book, but it is like drinking from a fire hose. I needed to go through it twice, and will probably make a third attempt in the next few years."
2,No greek at all,"Everybody knows Robertson's Word Pictures to be an excellent reference for Bible study.But I was deceived by this edition of his work: no greek, no grammar explained. It is an abridged version !Maybe I made an error in choosing this edition, but don't make the same, and buy the original version !"
5,Jazzed,I have used WPNT in my personal study and in my class prep for decades. It gives more than just the definitions of the Greek words. It gives the feel and taste of the passage as well.I wish there were more like this!
3,"They DO hold on, maybe a little too good!","I got a set of these for Father's Day in '08, and finally had a chance to use them last week. Two things I noticed: 1) because of the thickness of the metal strips inside, the outside of each socket is larger than a conventional one; 2) you very well might have to stick something through the top of the socket to get it to release whatever you've removed with it (i.e. sparkplugs).Both of these caused me extra work, and knowing what I know now, I would think twice before asking for this product now. Having said that, I can say the product seems well-made (although I didn't realize it was another dang import). I expect it'll come in handy sometime, but I won't reach for it unless I have to."
1,If you want your kid to end up on welfare read them this book...,"The message in this book is reflective of the overall tone of American society these days: ""Don't have ambition or push yourself, simply settle for what makes you comfortable and you'll be happy."" The book blatantly puts a negative spin on the characters in the book that are striving to push themselves outside of their comfort zone and grow in some fashion. I know some of you are thinking ""hey man, it's a kids book, lighten up"", but you know as well as I that our kids minds are very malleable at a young age and messages like this can and will shape their worldviews as they grow up. Imagine an entire generation of people who refused to push themselves because it was too hard or too uncomfortable. This nation rose to the top for the very reason that people pushed themselves and took risks that were uncomfortable. My recommendation: if you see this book, burn it."
1,Huh?,"I tried really hard but couldn't make it past the first third of this book. I kept waiting for the passengers and crew of the doomed spaceship to show some sort of reaction to having their ship fall out of the sky, but they seemed to treat it like a fire drill. As far as I know the plot was great, but the writing style was too muddy and confusing."
5,"Excelente, como todos los libros de él.","Es una lectura muy amena, para el que sabe un poco del idioma astrológico, sin embargo es fácil de leer, y el libro a diferencia de otros de SA está escrito de una forma más informal debido a que es tipo conferencias de pregunta y respuesta.Es un excelente complemento para el otro libro del mismo autor Person to Person Astrology."
3,"Complete, but small print","Very complete, found everything I wanted, but because of the compactness, the print is very small, so would not recommend for elderly eyes or anyone with serious vision deficiency [magnefication needed]."
1,Not complete does not offer the original word next to the Translation,"I am very disappointed to see what this book ended up being. I was expecting a Compact version of my Strong's Concordance but they changed it to the point of worthlessness. It is worth lugging the big book around in order to see the truth.For example you will never know from this book that YHWH (Hebrew 3068) is used nearly 7,000 times in the Hebrew scriptures."
2,Just an outline of substance,"This is a good book if you just want to know what's out there in terms of the different categories of technology. The author spends almost no time on any one technology, so this is purely just an overview book."
3,Decent,"I purchased this because I love the song Honey and the Moon, which turned out to be the best song on the album. The rest of the album was just mediocre. The use of spiritual references were throughout the album. I'm not saying this was a bad thing but in this case none of the spiritual referances reached me other than the song You've Been Loved. It is the other song that in my opinion carries the album. I still would recommend the purchase of this album if for no other reason than to support the artist that could write such a beautiful song as Honey and the Moon. Hopefully he has more songs like this one in him."
1,I've heard better from lesser knowns.,Just goes to show that it's publicity that builds record sales and not necessarily talent. Not a standout by any means.
1,"I rate this 0 stars, pity there's no 0 star rating","This is the worst CD I have ever heard! It's absoultely terrible! I can't belive that it's number 11. This woman has no talent! All of the songs sound the same, and the best way to describe her voice is a cat being strangled. Miseducation? Ha, I'd say that."
1,"lugubrious, monotonous, self-absorbed, conceited & paranoid","Well, that about says it, except for adding that she also can't sing worth a damn and her melodic sense is nil."
3,"""The World According To Lauryn""/ ""All About Lauryn""","Just to let everyone know, Lauren Hill reportly said that if she knew so many ""white people"" were going to listen to this album, she would have never made it.................................. OOOOOOOkay, Miss born again Christian, practice what u preach.It is a shame if this is true coz i would still like to listen to this album occasionally but at the same token, I don't want to support someone with a forked tongue.The reason i gave it 3 stars are:one star for lost onezone star for zionone star for can't keep my eyes off of uTHE REST OF YOUR ALBUM STANK GIRL!"
4,"I love lauryn Hill ,she's great and im glad she loves God!",I liked the way she exspressed herself at the Grammy awards and I think that's Great.
5,Prepare for a lesson in true lyrical skills,"This Album should be rename ""The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill,.... and the schooling or the Hip-Hop game!"" This album is truly powerful. There is a song on this album for everyone. From the Heavy Hip-Hop junkies (Lost Ones) to the Hopelessly in Love (Can't Take My Eyes Off You). This displays Lauryn's true ability to become a mega-star. I was impressed with her performace on the Fugees album Refugees when she did her rendition of Roberta Flacks' ""Killing Me Softly"". Her (Lauryn Hill) versatility to switch from R&B to Hip-Hop from one track to another is remarkable. This is just the beginning.If you CALL yourself a music listener of Hip-Hop and R&B, you would have this album right now instead reading my mediocore review of how much of mammoth album this.Chris Binns"
1,this is music?,"no no. this ""flash-in-the-pan"" will fade from all our minds in a couple of months. this is not genuine stuff, it seems to be contrived or tries too hard. please dont make any more records and take that Medusa ""head full of snakes"" hair-do with you."
1,Puleeeeeeeze!,Bought this cd and listened to it three times trying to see what the fuss was about. I then sold it on e-bay. I would like to know what is so great about this music? It totally escapes me. And I was further unimpressed when Miss Hill went on stage with a Bible in her hands. Why do black singers have to pretend that they are such religious fanatics? Please spare me!
2,So-So,"She has a good voice and all, but she really needs to think before she goes and starts talking. For example, in the song"" Doo Wop, That Thing,"" she's basically dissing women that have ""hair weaves like Europeans."" But if you notice her hair in the video- guess what? She's wearing a hair weave too, or else a bad wig. I can't tell. In the song ""Superstar"", she's dissing rappers who sample 70's music. But what's that in the background of the song? A retread of the Doors' ""Light my Fire""! Somehow when I was listening to ""Superstar,"" the words ""KILLING ME SOFTLY WITH HIS SONG"" took on a great deal of significance. And her rapping is obviously jocking Lil Kim's style (without the cussing, of course) I could have sworn I heard the line ""It's all About the Benjamins."" Look, she's a good singer and all, but on this album she's overly opinionated to the point where I didn't really like this album."
1,this is not,"i love hip-hop, r&b, soul, etc. before buying this cd i was glad at the fact that lauryn hill released her solo album. as soon as it was released in Korea, i ran to shop & bought it. but i was very disappointed. the songs were so boring & didn't appeal to me. i have a doubt about the praises & awards this album have received. this one absolute isn't worth them. those awards should have gone to faith evans or mary j. blige."
2,"A decent album, I've heard a lot better though...","Although I'll admit this CD has its charms, I firmly believe that it should not garner a five star rating. The detriments to this album include the following: first, the album is full of Lauryn Hill speaking inane lyrics that faintly resemble some sort of electronica instrument; second, the songs lack differentiation (as in they are mostly the same beat.); and finally, the bitter lyrics really give me a headache. (Disregard the rambling run-on sentances.)"
3,"Good mixture of music, but repetition makes it flat","""That Thing, That Thing...That same 'ol thing"" over and over. The music is smart and well blended , but the lyrics need some...well more than just repeating the same 2 sentences again and again. I would almost call it scat because it seems to be improve in the mike on 80% of the album. That nice live, but I get tired of harmony to ""oh ya...oh ya"" for 2 minutes. If it was live...it would be original and entertaining. But recorded it comes off as a pretentious waste of good music.Bottom Line....love the music, tired of the words."
2,Disappointing,"A sad time for music. How could a RACIST that takes other people's music win 5 Grammies? It must be the 90's and the political and liberal agenda at work. If you want REAL R and B, pick up Stevie Wonder, Roberta Flack, the Delphonics, etc."
5,Fantastic!,"It's a great album! Rap, hip-hop, soulful R&B all wrapped into one. She definitely has a soulful and powerful voice. A MUST to buy album!"
4,Terrific!,"All around a great CD, especially in this day and age where so many one-hit wonders somehow manage to put together an entire CD with the remaining songs being garbage. This CD has LOTS of great songs. Evertime I hear ""To Zion"", I get all choked-up! Talk about soulful!"
2,Garbage,"I think this album was a piece of garbage. She cannot sing,and she sounds like she's whining. She messed up alot of songs by trying to put them in her own words. Next time don't make any albums unless you have good music!"
5,One of the best CD's in the past five years,"Lauryn Hill's debut album is just full of indescribable talent. I love this CD. It is one of my favorite purchases, with beautiful melodies, touching lyrics, and is just so heartfelt. I could listen to this CD from start to finish every day. A lot of these songs have had significant radio airplay, but in fact my favorite ones aren't those which necessarily broke into the top 40. Ex-Factor (track 3) is one of the best songs on this CD, it's about relationships, and you can just feel what Lauryn Hill is talking about. I Used to Love Him, a great duet with Mary J. Blige brings a sense of strong feminine self-empowerment. This album is just pure Lauryn. You see the depth of her, her feelings, and it's not pretentious in any way. The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill (track 14) just says it all....Then of course there are the hidden tracks, Can't Take My Eyes off of You, and Untitled. I can't go on enough about this CD."
2,Overrated,"For reference, I have been following Lauryn since I first peeped ""Vocab"" back on the Fugees' first album.As for now, it's years later, and she drops two deadweights and goes out on her own. I find the album is immediately likable, but only two of her songs can withstand repeated listenings. As a hip-hop junkie, I still like the first track, filled with clever (albeit a bit soft) battle rhymes. And as a hip-hop junkie, that's all I like. The rest is a bad mix of hip-hop and R&B, which seem to be mixed just for the sake of mixing hip-hop and R&B. The results are songs like Ex-Factor, an otherwise perfectly lovely song if it were not for the ultra annoying ""yo yo yo yo yo"" background Lauryn insists on putting in.Oh well. I was looking forward for Lauryn to blaze the trail for the new generation of female hip-hoppers. Now instead of creating an exquisite hip-hop album, she made a sophmoric R&B album that is embraced by pop fans one month and totally forgotten the next."
1,This is all recycled trash stolen from other musicians.,She needs to get her own material and stop copying the reggae lines and phrases from Jamaican musicians.She is embarassingly un-original and put quite simply : a cornball. she tries (with nauseating effect) to be politically correct in every lyric. A word of advice: relax and try to discover yourself.
5,BJ IN CALIFORINA,I THINK THIS ALBUM WAS ONE OF THE GREATEST I HAVE EVER HEARD I AM REALLY IMPRESSED WITH HOW THIS SISTER IS HANDLING HER BUSINESS.
2,I don't get it,I really don't understand all of the publicity with lauryn hill. I bought her cd last year and loved the usual songs played on the radio but now it is one of the cds sitting on the lower level of my cd rack. SOme songs were real boring.
3,Overly Hyped Debut Album,"I bought this CD expecting a knock-out punch from THE performer at the time. The only stellar moment on this CD is ""Zion,"" which is amazing.Other than that, The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill, which was all the rage at the time, seems to me - in retrospect - to be nothing but a mediocre hip-hop album I eventually sold for half the price to a used CD store. A couple of the numbers on this CD are enjoyable,...Many will disagree with me about this, but it could have been infinitely more stellar.The woman has an unbelievable voice - though you won't hear much of it here - and far too often, an ubelievably ridiculous tale to tell.IF you get this album, spend the money for ""Zion"" alone."
3,Most overrated album of the year,"Without a doubt, this has to be the most overrated album of the year. It is very good, and enjoyable, but it had too much filler, and the bitterness in the lyrics get old after a while."
5,She Rocks,I think her cd is moving and tuches me very much. I think she can sing very well and has a beautiful vocie. she is my idle and I admire her admiration.
3,Library copy,"I got nostalgic when I thought of buying this CD off of Amazon. A classic Hip Hop Album, so when I saw the cheap price, I jumped on it. I buy stuff from Amazon all the time and have always been cautious. Right off the bat I noticed the copy of this cd had a ""Return to Library"" tag on it. Basically, I think someone got this copy from the library and sold it to me. Many scratches on the disc, and I havent even tried to play the CD. I guess I'm not mad, cuz it was so cheap. Its the principle of the thing."
5,It is so awesome. It describes what kids think love is!,"I don't write a lot. All I can say, is since Siter Act 2, I have admired Lauryn Hill. After I saw her talking with Cece Winans I was even more impressed with her. She has really done an awesome job and her music is so, not different, but different as in better."
5,"Definitely Album of the Year, No Question!!!!!!!","This was the best album I've heard in a long time. What I really like about her is her versatility from rapping to singing. I predict in the next millennium that she will continue to blow up the charts, unlike others. I think she will be hear for a long time. Lauryn keep up the good work and congradulations on your new baby!"
5,The BEST,"This CD is one of the best CD's I have in my collection. It's like a good poem. No matter how much you hear it, it's always fresh. I encourage anyone who is even the least bit interested in R&B/Hip Hop to get this album. Enjoy!"
4,I loved this album!,"I really enjoyed this album. It was probably overrated, and I think a lot of people let that get in the way of their listening. They didn't WANT to like it because it has received so many accolades. But just because you didn't like it, that doesn't mean that it's horrible. If you think the album is terrible just because you didn't like it, that's rather self-centered, don't you think? I don't think there is really good music and bad music. There is just music that is enjoyed by more people than other music. And Lauryn Hill's album was enjoyed by a lot of people."
3,"""The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill"" becomes an overrated album","I personally don't understand why this album received all the attention it got. Maybe it's because I've never been a fan of hip hop music or R&B music in general, but then again...if this album is supposedly so amazing shouldn't I be able to appreciate it as a music fan? I'm not gonna deny that certain tracks stand out real nicely, and have a great beauty to them, but I believe the album tries much too hard and doesn't always succeed. With the exception of ""Zion"" and ""Ex Factor"", many of the tracks on this album are just plain over-dramatic, which leads Lauryn Hill to look like some sort of savior, when she's really just a good poet with decent musical capabilities and a gorgeous voice. I believe her win for album of the year was undeserved...this album has way too much credibility to it...too much for me to stand."
5,The Best Christmas Songs,Bing Crosby's best recording of beautiful Christmas songs for the family. Not well known because he sings of the Christ child and the true meaning of Christmas.
3,Missing too much,"I came to this David Copperfield thinking I had acquired the fine dramatization done in 1986 by Andrew Hall with Colin Hurley as David, Simon Callow as Micawber and Paul Brightwell as Uriah Heep. Needless to say I was quite disappointed. By comparison with that earlier version, which aired on Masterpiece Theater, this seems clipped and even forced. The depth of the characters never seems to come fully out. In all fairness, if I had not seen the other first, I would have said this captures the heart of a giant book with reasonable fidelity."
2,oldie and so so story,Young Thandie and Nicole in a boring movie. If you are collecting movies about either actress leave this one out. I would have given it one star but seeing the two acting together is a two star novelty.
4,Eureka!,Ever wonder what happened to the country that issued those funny shaped stamps in the 1930s? A Nobel physic winner and friend tried wading through Russian Red Tape to find out.
4,"Mostly Great, But Slightly Condescending!","Did you know of certain artists who painted scenes on a human hair! Yes, bring your magnifying glass! Or singing in 2 part harmony with only one singer! I surely did not before reading this book! However, as a stamp collector starting at a very young age (about 7) , I also was fascinated by the Tanna Tuva stamps, and still have a nice assortment of diamonds and triangles. This book is an amusing and informative read, not least in its descriptions of meetings between Soviet and western scholars during some of the ""Bad Old Days"" of the 1980's Cold War, including moments like the shooting of KAL 007 near Korea. At times , though, there does seem to be a slightly condescending attitude towards a small section of Siberia based on what seems ""funny"" to English speakers. Nonetheless a very worthwhile read, with many amusing anecdotes, not to mention the amazing cancer recovery attitude of Mr. Feynmann himself!"
1,Same problems with my first card!,"This card is horrible. I had an SBLive 5.1 X-Gamer. The SBLive sounds way better then this. I put in this card and played a song. It was like comparing VHS to DVD. (SBLive was the DVD) I have Windows Xp and it sounds horrible! I decided to humor myself, so i started GTA3. (The cutscenes had weird problems) I triggered and cutscene and geuss what! SAME PROBLEM! This card was a load ...."
4,Delightful summary of a great life.,This book is not a 'life and times' volume. It is single-minded in its telling of Elizabeth's life. I found the book to be captivating. I keep it on my desk at work for those rare days when I don't go out to lunch. I know that I can always open the book to any page and find an interesting story ahead.
5,Epitomy of 80's decadence,"This album has two of the greatest covers of all time:slayer's rousing version of In A Godda Da Vida and The Bangles incredible remake of Hazy Shade of winter. Who could ever forget the scene when the movie opens and that song plays, it is simply breath taking. This album features alternative 80's tunes that is essential to any cd collection."
3,Three Stars,"The movie held my interest but I found it to be very depressing. Theacting was great, I felt the actors got there point across to tell there story."
1,Why did I waste my $$$$$?,There is only one good song on this whole album...don't waste your money unless you are super religious-then maybe you can relate to this music.
5,Cool!,"I don't know how well it works but the concept is awsome. I would try it out but it is packed in a compact fashion and I don't know if I can re-fold it back up that tight. Therefor, it's in my B.O.B. for emergencies. Small, compact and I like it."
2,Too much detail,"The author obviously has lots of knowledge about routers, and doesn't mind telling you how much more he knows than you. I've gotten more and better information from monthly magazines."
5,"Three Rooms, Five Stars!","Nothing beats Eddie From Ohio live, and this CD is a great example! They chose a great mix of their best newer live tunes, plus some not-often-heard older stuff. If you have never heard EFO before, the only reason this album isn't a good ""first listen"" is because you'll never want to hear a studio-recorded version of any of these songs again! I was at the Somerville Theater show that part of this was recorded at, and it truly is just like being there. Vintage EFO in that the tunes just put you in a happy state of mind! Not only are Julie, Mike, Eddie, Robbie and Bob the NICEST people ever, they also make a damn fine team o'performers. And the cover art rocks. :)"
2,A long magazine article,"I wanted very much to like this book. I'm keenly interested in the affect media has on individuals and society and have read quite a lot in this area. Zengotita's breezy, intelligent and humorous style merely frustrated me. He presents mostly opinion, an extended essay. It is fascinating opinion, but not the sort of helpful fact-based analysis or data-driven synthesis I was hoping for. Perhaps if this is your first introduction to the field, the book would be enjoyable (though Neil Postman's ""Amusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business"" is for my money a great essay-like introduction to this field."
3,Cynical City,"If you enjoy opinions from ultra liberal/cynical ""intellectuals"" who like to give their opinion on life/politics/media you will love this book. The more I read, the more I disliked the author, although I did laugh at times. I had to read it for a book report."
5,Hard to Kill,A man awakens from a seven year coma and seeks revenge on the men who left him for dead and murdered his family. Steven Seagal is one of the best martial-artist to ever come to the big screen with the moves he performs. Great movie.
2,Steven Seagal is...Hard to Believe!!!,"The movie is Hard to Kill, but the story is Hard to Swollow.In this movie, Seagal and his hot new girlfriend go to get revenge for his murdered wife...Sure.Great action but the story SUCKS!"
3,Another early feature of Seagal's,"True,this Seagal flick is a bit more spaced-out and repetitive than most of his flicks and it has a tendancy to shy away from it's grounding as an action flick into thriller territory.But this is still a classic in his league.There are some fabulous fight sequences towards the end,Seagal has one of the coolest names in action movie history,Mason Storm,and I have to say this is the only real film of his which I can appreciate as a piece of entertainment.In other words,there's no moral to the story like there seems to be in every other one of his flicks (i.e. On Deadly Ground,Marked for Death,The Patriot,Nico et al),it's just a film,not a piece of social commentary.Jean Claude Van Damme could just as easily have been in the lead role here.A Seagal flick on its own."
2,Japanese artfilm-false buy??,"I thought-someone told me that-Ed McBain was the writer of the short story,where the movie was based on.That's why I bought it.I did not find any confirmation or clue on this.Can anyone help me,I am intriged.Thanks.P.S.Movie is OK. if you like this japanese form of art."
1,Abridged? Decimated!,"Anyone wanting to read Hodge, should go with the three volume edition. Yes, there is far too much interaction with the pseudo-science of the day, but this ""abridgement"" lays waste to whole areas of interest to anyone who would want to read Hodge in the first place. It's interesting that one of the areas where the cutting is most obvious is in the area where the ""editor"" disagrees with Hodge the most, that is the locus of ""eschatology"". The editor is a Premillennialist and Hodge, like all Princetonians was a clear Postmillennialist. If you want to read Hodge without the excess verbiage, buy A.A Hodge's ""Outlines of Theology"", which is based on the very same lectures that Charles Hodge published as his Systematics. It's simpler, yet doesn't alter the truth the way this chopped-up mess does. This abridgement is a master maligned."
4,Love It,What a great and funny show this was in the eighties. Everybody was talking about it at that time. It was wonderfull to watch the episodes again. To bad that they didn't put any extra's ..........
5,Soap is Hilarious,Bought this and love love love it. We have a Soap night. Neighbors come over once a week and we laugh histerically. Great show. Shame they took it off the air.
4,Goodbye Benson!,"Robert Guilliame (still) appears in the photo on the front of the package. This season his character,Benson DuBois would be spun off on the hit series BENSON. Benson worked for Jessica Tate's(Katherine Helmond) widowed cousin Gov. James Gatling. The rest of the SOAP cast is still intact. Billy Crystal,as the homosexual Jodie Dallas,hadn't yet become a major film star."
3,extang tonneau cover,I was disappointed with the item. I guess it was my fault because I just assumed it would fit when I did a web search and this cover came up. I didn't check the product details. The cover didn't fit and also came in a little scratched. The scratches wasn't amazon's fault. Amazon refunded my purchase but not the freight. I paid $50 for freight because I live in Hawaii. I brought the issue to Amazon's attention but they said I should have read the product description. I was disappointed there by the 3 stars.
5,Big Leaguer,As baseball fan. I've waited for this movie to released on DVD. Strong performance by Edward G. Robinson. Vera-Ellen was excellent as the female lead.
4,"Great System, Could Use Better Speakers","I love this system! It's feature packed and looks great where ever you put it. I bought it mostly because I wanted a system that could play my MP3 cds as well as my purchased ones. It's great not having to use my computer to play loads of (my favorite) music on one disc. There is one thing I would like to point out, that the speakers are not as great as they could be. To tell you the truth, my computer speakers are better sounding than these (but then again, my pc speakers did cost me an extra $400. Klipsch Promedia 5.1 :-P ) and so I ended up using those speakers in place of the original Koss ones. Besides one drawback, I would definitely recommend this product to anyone looking for a system with MP3 playback capabilities for their home entertainment purposes. Otherwise, just get a portable cd-mp3 player and plug it into a powerful speaker system."
3,Not as good as the game it borrowed its engine from,Now the game itself is very fun and challenging and has a lot to offer but the engine they used was AOE2s. They did a bad job using it. I found that there was very poor path finding and the AI was pretty crappy. Besides those downsides a solid RTS
3,Runs Small,This shoe runs half size smaller because of the the padding inside. Also the shoe strings are way to short. My son will not get much use of them but they are good looking shoes and made well.
2,not as good as i thought,It took me quiet long to get into all of the three stories!! The last one from C.E. Murphy was probly the one that i liked most but i was a liitle dissapointed. It did not really meet my expectiations
1,"The Last Juror? No, the latest BORE!!","This was nothing like any of Grisham's past novels....the title alone is nothing like you'd expect. First, there was no 'last' juror...only 3 died in the book. And there was no single juror that held any precidence over the others at all that had any major plot line of the story. I feel that two thirds of the novel is completely irrelevant. I'm sure that it would be interesting to anyone wanting to know about the history of Clanton during the 70's; to them it would have been astounding....but no, it was a historical bore!I wanted a courtroom thriller, but really, any drama in the courtroom happened completely randomly in the last 10 pages....I kept reading only because I wanted the monotonous story line to end.If you are looking forward to one another one of Grisham's better thriller, wait till his next book....this one is a bore from page 5 through 455. Sleep Tight!!"
1,"Boring, boring, boring",This book is a boring yarn that I thought would never end. It has no particular plot and just rambles away. I fail to understand why the author thought that this might be interesting.
1,Very disappointing,"Being a huge Grisham fan, I could not wait to read The Last Juror. That quickly turned to being unable to wait to finish it! The book began great, but quickly changed. It just seemed like it did not know where it was going...so many things, too many things were going on. I'd pass on this one."
3,"interesting storyline, boring","I skipped through most of the book. The book, to me, seemed to drag on too many unnecessary details. I was bored with most of it and just want to get to the plot and the ending."
3,Good read,"The last Juror is the second book i've read from John Grisham. It takes place in a small town in Mississippi where a big crime is committed and shakes the entire county. Its is set in the 1970s when segregation was still happening. Grisham did a good job incorporating the issue of segregation in the plot. A white man committed a rape and suicide and was sentenced to life in prison but after nine years, was released. Then certain jurors from that trial began getting murdered. Throughout this entire ordeal, Willie, the county's only newspaper editor, covered the trial.What I was confused about was the title. Personally, i don't think it fits with the story. I didn't see the ending coming when Willie, the main character, found out who had been killing the jurors.Overall, i think it's a good novel and i would recommend it to people interested in books that deal with the law."
4,"Pleasantly satisfying, yet earing for more.","I wouldn't call this book amazing, just because I read THE RAINMAKER before I read this one. Although this book did not have the same thrilling-suspense like some of his other books, it still maintained the Grisham cliche courtroom drama we've grown to love. But what it also adds is his amazing descriptive ability to actually bring the reader inside the book and make them feel like they are a citizen of the town standing right behind the main character, watching every move he makes. You want the book to move on, you don't care if anything exciting happens, you jsut want to know what's going to happen tomorrow in Clanton. This book was beautifully written and deserves no less than 3 stars on ANY review."
3,Not nearly as charged as the first clanton novel,"This is a much watered down Clanton adventure. I really enjoyed the characters of Willie Traynor and Miss Callie, and this was really more a story of their relationship than anything. The Padgit fiasco was definately interesting, but the ending is less than spectacular. A good book by Grisham, though definately not his best."
2,Boring,I usually enjoy Grisham's books and even tolerate his political views but this book was dreadfully boring. The story just lacked the thrill and suspense of his former books and the plot was just too predictable. The end was so disappointing that I kept thinking that I missed something. Would not recommend this book unless you need something to put you to sleep.
5,Wonderful story,"I am not going to summarize the book, that has been done enough, I don't normally do that in my reviews.......anyway, I really enjoyed this book. I was surprised at all the mixed reviews I read on Amazon as well as some papers and magazines. I thought this was one of Mr. Grisham's best. I have to admit, for you skeptics out there, I have always been a fan of Mr. Grisham's, but I have felt his last few books have not lived up to my expectations. I think this one is WONDERFUL. I think Mr. Grisham is just a great storyteller, and this was one great story. The charcters were believable and interesting, and the story itself grabbed my interest and would not let go. I for one am thrilled to have a Grisham book that rates up there with A Time to Kill, The Firm,and Pelican Brief. This book will join my stack of Grisham's that I like to reread, just for the enjoyment of a good story."
3,More of a relationship book...,"When I picked up the book, I was expecting a legal thriller like so many of Grisham's previous books. This is not a legal thriller. Actually the main focus on this story isn't about the trial but about the main character's friendship with one of the jurors. It's not a bad book...but if you were looking for a legal thriller...this wasn't it. Wait for paperback if you really feel like buying the book."
2,"Terrible book, poor editing","This feels like Grisham's attempt to write Southern literature, rather than suspense fiction. The entire book feels like a feeble attempt to imitate Harper Lee. Don't let the book jacket fool you, a full 1/3 of the book cover stuff that isn't related to the trial at all.The editing is also poor. Once he used the same exact descriptive sentence in two different places in the novel. In another, he describes a young man wants to be a draft dodger but is convinced to go to Vietnam by his parents. Less than 10 pages later Grisham writes that the parents begged their son not to go.The entire plot is a let down. There is no suspense, the ""surprise ending"" meager and predictable, and Grisham wastes half the novel writing about utter non-sense that is not related to the story and is not charming."
3,"One Small Town, Another Tale","Grisham strikes again, but not as hard as usual. In this book, he just does not offer as much of a puzzle to be enjoyed by the reader as he usually does. The story does not really capture you, and as a result, leaves you wondering why you are trying to get through a book that really is not as good as it could have been. It just kind of drones on and on for a while before it gets to be the least bit interesting, but when it does it can draw you in. However, that is only the last forth of the book. Otherwise, it is very, very slow. If you are a fan, you can expect enjoy this book, but if you are not you might be bored. This may even lead you to question why you are reading this author, but you should try other titles before you jump to the conclusion that he is overhyped. Anyway, get it if you are a real Grisham fan, but try another title if you are not."
4,A meldng of the legal thriller and the small town story,"Awesome! This is a magnificent meld of Grisham's legal-thriller type stuff with a beautiful story of small-town interactions and friendships. I thought this was a great development in Grisham's writing style, and this was the book that made me want to try The Broker. Definitely pick this up. But DO NOT READ THE INNER JACKET, because it gives away about 70% of the action, and I would have rather seen the plot develop without reading the spoilers in the jacket. I don't know why they put so much info there."
1,What happened to Grisham?,"I think John Grisham usually writes excellent legal thrillers, but this one was horrible. He seemed to be very wordy without having a point. He dragged things on, the conclusion was poor and unfullfilling for all the time put into reading the plot. The characters were likable, but just did not seem to go anywhere."
4,Another Grisham fun read,I look forward to John Grisham's books because they have a plot that keeps you interested. I worked in a law office many years and like his descriptions of law procedures. I've read all his books. Some are better than others but I'm glad I read this one. I read it in two days because I had to find out what would happen.
2,But....!,Rarely have so many cliches about the South been found in one single place. The black lady with 7 children all with Ph.D.'s was too much for me! Her sexually adventurous 8th child was more believable.
2,Much Liberal Propaganda,"A college journalism dropout buys a struggling rural county newspaper in Mississippi, only to find himself embroiled in a sensational murder trial. Really a portrait of the deep rural South in the decade after the end of Jim Crow, with some crime and suspense thrown in.But Grisham uses much of the novel to editorialize, through his protagonist, against the Vietnam War, against Wal-Mart, and in favor of forced busing. The only area where conservatives come out well is where some of the best characters attend church regularly. Read some politically incorrect history after reading this one to get a balanced view."
2,meh,"Like the past few efforts from grisham, this one catches it's stride after a couple of boring chapters, keeps you plodding along out of mild curiosity, blazes through a bunch of frivilous events near the end, then plunges you off a cliff with no climax, and a confusing ""resolution"". My love for courtroom novels, and grisham's earlier work keep me searching for his long awaited return to form. This isn't it."
1,Very boring..read the short version,I have read every John Grisham novel and found this to be very very boring.The best way to read this book:1. Read the first twenty pages2. Read about twenty pages in the middle3. Read the last twenty pagesAll the other material is just fluff and a real waste of time.
1,suckered,"I was in the airport with nothing to read and there was a huge pile of Grisham's books. How bad can it be? Terrible. If it wasn't a ""Grisham"" it would not be published. He should stop preaching and write a good story."
2,Grisham Abandons Success Formula - Again,"Normally, I can not put a Grisham book down. The Firm, The Client, The Street Lawyer, The King of Torts all have that fast paced excitement we expect from a Grisham legal thriller. Such is not the case with The Last Juror. Although there are some interesting parts, this book reads much more slowly and lacks the excitement of most Grisham novels.The Last Juror is much more about life in a small southern town than it is a suspense novel. If you liked The Painted House then you will probably like this book too (I didn't like The Painted House at all). Just don't expect it to be a legal thriller."
4,One of Grisham's Best in a Long Time!,"I haven't been too impressed with Grisham's writing of late, but I thoroughly enjoyed the Last Juror. Grisham's depiction of the rural south during the 60's and 70's kept me reading. More than that, I found myself engrossed in the relationship between Ms. Callie and Willie and watching Willie, a ""city slicker"" become a beloved member of Clanton. Sure, the book had a murder mystery, romance, etc., etc., but this book was more about the growth of an unlikely friendship and what can happen if we open ourselves up to the unexpected. One of Grisham's best books since A Painted House."
4,Refreshing change of pace,"""The Last Juror"" is a bit of anomaly. There are many times when I have read non-fiction and found it hard to believe that the story is TRUE. While reading ""The Last Juror"" I had to keep reminding myself that it was in fact fiction. Such is the charm of Grisham's novel... it is warm, chraming and, at times, thrilling.The actual story is fairly predictable and at points, brutally slow. Another slight annoyance is Grisham's portrayal of northern Mississippi. I feel that he has focused more on the stereotyopes of the region and less on actual day-to-day life (I have lived in NE Mississippi for the last 5 years).I think Grisham found a nice balance of legal thrillers with his more human interest type stories. I would suggest ""The Last Juror"" to anyone who enjoyed ""Midnight in The Garden of Good And Evil"". I definitely suggest it as a nice quick read, especially if you happen to be at the beach!"
4,Good read,"I enjoyed this book, it's a good interesting read as you're waiting to see what the twist is going to be! I keep turing the pages so in all a worthwhile book!"
2,Grisham Fell Down,Not your typical Grisham novel. It lacked quite a bit of the detail you normally expect from him. He spent quite a bit of time weaving characters and events into the story that never really added anything. It just seems to meander. I'll buy his next book and hope he wakes up in time before he becomes another James Patterson.
5,Great Reading on a Snowy Weekend,"I have read and enjoyed all of John Grisham's books, but I reserve a special place in my heart for the ones that give me not only a good story, but also a good belly laugh. This one was good for not one gut-buster, but two! I haven't laughed this hard since the boathouse scene in ""The Client"". Tears were literally falling to the page. Call me warped, but I find at least one scene in every Grisham book to be extremely funny. To find two was indeed a pleasure. Read this if you are already a Grisham fan, or if you simply want to be entertained by a good story with memorable characters. Enjoy !"
5,Grisham has returned!,"This is ellen in atlanta and A Time to Kill was my favorite Grisham book--until now. He's back to his excellent writing and beautiful character studies. Some authors am giving up on, but Grisham, write about what you want--keep your heart in Ford County!"
5,The Last Juror,"John Grisham has created another great thriller, complete with his usualhumor and sensitivity. It is a good book to curl up with on a wintry day, and will definitely keep you reading and anticipating the next page.If you have not read any of John Grisham's books, I recommend that youtry other titles also.Amazon.com is a very good place to get your best sellers."
4,Nail biter - yes . Fast paced - Noooooooo !!,"A John Grisham novel, where the courtroom drama is minimal - it ends in the first few pages itself. It is so different from ""The Client"" or the ""Runaway Jury"". The author has managed to sprinkle humor at several places - jus to quote - the Ivy league ""Syracuse"" and Will being rechristened as Willie.There are times when the story wanders off and it is difficult to understand what the author wants to convey thro those narrations.The story is a nail-biter. However, it is so not because you wanna know ""What happens next ?"" but want to know ""what the author is taking you with this ?"".I read this on my loooong flight from San Jose to Cincinnati. It was a worthy read !"
1,Disappointing,"This video was a disappointment. It begins by showing several exercises with about five reps each. It then shows each exercise done for 15 reps then 12 reps then 8 reps, the next exercise, 15, 12, 8, the next, 15, 12, 8 and on and on, and all from the same camera angle. Much better would be to introduce an exercise with about five reps, show it from the side then from the back. Show it a couple of more times pointing out specific parts of form that should be observed, ""make sure to do this, do that, do the other"". Then show it a few times done wrong, ""don't do this, don't do that, and don't do this other"". Having done this they could then instruct the viewer to do each exercise for 15 reps, then 12, then 8. Here they offer five minutes of information crammed into an hour video."
3,"Van Damme? Ehh, but BOLO!!!","This is Van Damme's first starring role. He looks in his twenties, but I don't know. For some reason, he's fitted with an awful toupee (two actually, one is more tussled than the other, supposedly expressing his youth). Maybe he was prematurely bald but they look bad. (And never get mussed in fight scenes.He's okay as Mr. Marshal-Arts Goody Two Shoes. His bearded beer drinking dork of an American buddy is better. But what's best is BOLO YEUNG as the villian. He's my new hero. He's jaw droppingly good as the bad guy. I just ordered TIGER CLAW. The best thing I've seen since ODD JOB in Goldfinger... better.If he's got a fanclub, I'm a member."
2,"Highly Predictable, but with Fair Choreography","Not bad work from Arnold & VanDamme. Follows the usual predictable martial arts movie plot (really, we wouldn't expect anything less!). I am however fascinated that reviewers, et al still write about the events on this movie being based upon the ""real life"" experiences of Frank Dux. Dux has long been discredited as a liar and fake, both as a martial artist (Dux was never in a ""kumite"" competition), and as a military ""hero"" (never in the CIA, and was only in the Marines for 6 mos., & never left the U.S. during the Vietnam era), see LA Times Valley edition, May 1, 1988 article ""Ninja: Hero or Master Fake?"" by John Johnson. Of course, none of this detracts from VanDamme's attempts at acting. If you want plot, you'll be disappointed. But if you like correography--then buy this movie and get ready to use the fast forward button!"
4,Ignore the based on a true story part,This show was fun to watch. It has a good execution of the formula used for martial- arts shows. Van Damme in the best role of his career. Watch the movie as it is. A Martial- arts movie with plenty of good action. Ignore the based on a true story part as Frank Dux was exposed as a complete and utter fraud. That true story part of the show makes it 1 star short of 5 stars.
5,"Used for 55"" TV","I purchased this cart to hold a 55"" Vizio LCD for a church. We anticipate rolling the unit to many different classrooms in the building. I was very impressed with the weight and heft of the unit. It was fairly easy to assemble. I didn't need assistance to mount the TV to the unit. It rolls very easily with the TV on it. And the unit will roll easily through a 32"" door or larger.I highly recommend this Cart for business or institution use."
5,Call Home Mr. Hart and tell your Mother...........,"Everytime I see this film, I get so glad that I dropped out of Law School. Kingfield is alive, well and lurking out there. If you are thinking about going to Law School, see this film if you have time between reading canned briefs. The ""Little Questions that tumble in your brain are really there. The Stress over grades is real, the classmates who crash & burn are real. I can not recommend this film too highly to potential 1Ls."
3,Okay addition,"This is one in a series starring Stanley Hastings as a reluctant PI who is a writer ! I have read better ones from Hall, however, I will continue reading his series. I enjoy the character of Hastings"
5,Studies in the Sermon on the Mount,Oswald Chambers' works inspire and challenge as well as instruct me in my relationship with God and man. Highly recommended.
3,Nice Ideas,"I love gardening but am not the best at designing gardens, so I frequently look for books to give me ideas about designs. This one has quite a few nice designs will full plant lists, but unfortunately, it was lacking on designs for my area or zone. Only one garden in the entire book fit my zone, which is 28. I would suggest that in the future each garden design includes substitutions for plants to make it fit in other areas or zones."
2,more-or-less attempt to copy the original french movie,"This movie is American copy of the French comedy Taxi, originally shown in 1998. The US version has just changed actors and brands of the car, of course. It is funny, though sometimes I had a feeling that the humor is forced to be American funny at any costs. With barely original ideas, it is good for those who like cheap comedies. If you are a movie geek, get a French version of Taxi. It offers you different perspective on racing movies, it is funny, but most of all, IT IS ORIGINAL. (www.amazon.fr/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000DD2ZY)"
1,Ugh,"Who in the world thought Jimmy Fallon would be funny enough to carry a film? And isn't Latifah a bit overexposed these days? When you are reduced to making Daewoo jokes, then you know you hit the skids."
3,It;s OK,"This comedy is about a rev head woman who gets mixed up with a cop whose a plain dork who cant drive. Together they work on stopping a couple of supermodels who are bank robbers.Comedy is ok in some parts, but couldve been alot better.It doesnt make much sense to use a cab that convertes into a hot rod and is harldy used in the film that much. What was it supposed to be? James Bond gone taxi?The bonus features are ok. The best is the Comedy Central interveiw, check that out, it's pretty funny! The movie has a few laughs, but nothing that sticks out. I wouldnt say there is anything special about this movie, but it's ok for a rental. It's better then I thought, but again, nothing speicel."
4,"Dated ,but good","I watched this series and enjoyed it , it's a bit dated but Helen Mirren is fantastic and the plot works really well."
5,amazing,"it's so hard to find a song, and even more so an album, that is put together so well that it tells a rich and endearing story, with multiple facets that come at you from every angle. i've listened to this album straight through so many times, and every time i listen to it i hear something new and fascinating. conceptually from start to finish, it is inspiring and awesome. great producer, great mastering, great band. i always bitch about how music in general just ain't how it used to be (in reference to Queen, Rush, or any solid rock band in the 70s and 80s) and Brazil has tried and succeeded in making something real and beautiful again in music. http://www.braziltheband.com"
1,Ungodly Awful,"Are you sure this wasn't a parody of a bad '60's English thriller?Horrible directing - no surprise (Preminger). Terrible dialog. Lots of bad acting (Olivier is good, however). Ridiculous situations. Horrible editing (Ed Wood, Jr.?). And worst of all - a third act that is just interminable. I think it's still going on - I don't know, I had to leave after they repeated the same stupid gimmick four times (or more - I don't know 'cause I left).Oh...also, why The Zombies? I mean I like them but...what...the...hell?Also, doesn't anyone in England lock their doors? Talk about re-using a cheap gimmick...Tuer l'idole"
5,Love it,"The Hot Buttered Popcorn sign looks great! It measures about 16 and 1/2 inches by almost 12 inches. It looks just like the picture shown and despite what I read on another review being flimsy, the metal is the typical tin sign that most all the others are and actually looks sturdier since the metal bends back on the ends and that makes it stronger. I love how the sign looks."
2,MY GRADE: C plus.,"British humor is very much hit or miss for me and this is one of those misses. It's all about the death of a patriarch that brings his friends and other contacts together in a goofy, mismatched farce. Slow beginning big time but if you absolutely love British humor, well, it might be worth it.I watched this one for close to an hour simply because it didn't require my full attention and I was surfing the Web. I know some people out there think you have to give 100% to a movie to properly grade it but that's a lot of rubbish and just goes to show some people cannot multitask, especially when watching a film that is average or lower.Peter Dinklage has a supporting role in this but he isn't anything like his Tyrion character so don't go in with expectations.The budget was $9M and it made a bit over $46M at the Box Office.STORY/PLOTTING/EDITING: B minus; HUMOR: C minus; CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B minus; WHEN WATCHED: mid July 2012; OVERALL GRADE: C plus."
5,Very funny movie,"Having seen the movie on TV (with all of the commercials) we bought the DVD and were able to watch the whols movie, it was very funny."
4,Quirky Black Comedy,"This is a very funny, irreverent, quirky black comedy.The various diverse people gathering for a funeral make for great characters, some lovable some not.This is a laugh out loud, good belly laugh movie highly recommended."
2,just ok,saw this movie over the weekend and it was predictable and the punch lines were a dime a dozen. the pacing was hit and miss as well. I expected to like it once the actual funneral started but then the film became one big cliche and it reminded me of a few other better films in the same vein which this one was desperately trying to channel.
5,Great film- better than the American one,"Go for the original, this version, when you're looking for funny. The American knock off version copies every bit, and even uses the same dwarf actor. This one has class, the other is trash."
4,Dysfunctional family farce,"When the father of a completely dysfunctional family dies, members of his extended family arrive to give him a dignified send off, but, with such a family, it turns into an English Drawing room farce. The oldest son,Daniel and his wife, live with the deceased and his wife and from the start, things go awry. The wrong body is in the coffin and sets the scene for all the other scenes. One of the younger family members is manufacturing and selling halucinogenic pills and unwittingly allows them to be mistaken for Valium with the expected results and one of the eldest members of the family is a cranky, bad tempered old devil who has an unfortunate episode of loss of bowel control which really made me heave! I didn't enjoy this movie as much as 4 weddings and a funeral, but the writing was excellent and the cast were first rate."
2,others ideas of fun??,A relative who'd seen this film reported it as VERY funny so I ordered it. Delivery by Amazon was VERY slow and the film was simply awful when it finally arrived - others ideas of funny ?? Not again.
1,"Wow apparently I'm one of those Americans who doesn't ""get"" British Humor!","I was looking forward to this movie after reading all of the positive reviews from people here in the USA who thought this movie was hilarious.In the first hour I didn't laugh even once. (One half-chuckle, though.) To me this was just a tedious plot of offbeat characters showing up at a funeral and acting inappropriately -- but not in a funny way. For example, one of the guests accidentally ingests an LSD-like drug before the funeral, and then he is all weird and trippy during the service. I kept waiting for the ""funny"" part to start! After an hour I hit fast-forward on my Tivo, and finally, delete.For me it was a big disappointment. The other reviewers must be much more worldly than I am, or more sophisticated, or something."
3,Irish tongue-in-cheek wit,"A light, disrespectful tale of events at a cheating man's funeral. One tends to forget the decedent when confronted with the hilarious turn of events at his wake."
5,A dark comedy that will leave you breathless with laughter,"British satire at it's best, Death At A Funeral is a dark comedy full of painful humor. There's not a person in the world who could watch this and not laugh at it.There really are no words for this brilliant film. Just go watch it. Now. Seriously."
1,Are you kidding me???,Are you kidding me? Is this seriously a professional film?I can't think of a worse way to spend 2 hours of my life!
2,I can't believe I paid for this :(,"I've been a fan of Benefit's Babe Cakes for many years, and now that Babe Cakes has been discontinued I am on a search for the perfect cake eyeliner. This cake eyeliner is not up to par. When applied with a damp liner brush, it just soaks into the cake and does not stay on the brush bristles at all. With Babe Cakes there was much more control. When I finally do get the color on my eyes, it's barely there - I have to do it multiple times to get a little bit of color. I would not buy this again."
4,A very thought provoking collection of essays and memoirs,"This book should be read by anyone interested in Egyptian polictics, women's lives, and how Middle Easterners view Westerners. Saadawi is a psychiatrist by training and is in her mid 70s. She expounds on such topics as the rise of fundamentalism and its backlash against women and the negative effects of globalization. For example she points out that back when she was in medical school, in the early 50s, none of the women in her class wore the veil. She includes a very touching vignette about one of her patient, a young woman who goes crazy from isolation imposed by her distant fundamentalist father. While I don't necessarily agree with all of Dr. Saadawi's views they are certainly enlightening and thought provoking. Dr. Saadawi has also suffered imprisonment under Sadat's presidency and death threats from fundamentalists for her opinions."
1,Not what I was looking for.,"An explanation of each dramatic situation would have been helpful. However, the author only gives a list of works that a situation can be found in. The book was not what I was looking for. I wanted something to help me write conflict and plot. Maybe it would be helpful if I shifted through the massive reading list the author provides. Over all, I was not satisfied with this."
1,Don't waste your money,"Used it once and put it in the dogs' tub. It's really awkward to use. It sucks up your water pressure, too. Can't figure it out. I have incredible water pressure, but with this thing on, it went down to nothing. Stick to the original shower massage by Waterpik."

3,SLOW STARTER WITH A REDEEMING ENDING! 2 1/2 STARS!,"I wasn't sure what to expect when I sat down to watch this film as I always expect to see Anne Hathaway in a fluffy romantic comedy. This is certainly a different film for her and I'm not sure if having her star helped the film or hurt it. On one hand I didn't see the end coming until three quarters of the film was over, because at times this feels like a fluffy romantic film. On the other hand it doesn't really draw you in as much as I would have liked because it feels like a fluffy romantic movie. I don't want to give the film away because the ending is the only redeeming quality the film really has. It's not all that original, but it does have some impact."
2,Cash in your ticket,"Short Attention Span Summary (SASS):1. Plane crashes2. Anne Hathaway plays a grief counselor providing her services to the 5 survivors.3. She doesn't seem to be having much luck4. Against professional ethics, she gets involved with one of them5. People start dropping out of counseling6. It's probably because of her boring questions7. The so called twist is obvious more than half an hour before the end, but still they prolong and drag it out like pulling fingernails.8. If you've got a ticket to ride you'd be better off cashing it in.You can probably sleep through the first half of the movie after reading (1.) and (2.) above. Shortly after that, you'll see the twist. Wait ten minutes to confirm it, then go back to sleep until the credits start rolling.The entire cast sleepwalks their way through this dull drama, the punch line of which has been done before, and better.Amanda Richards, January 25, 2009"
1,"Painfully dull, poorly written rip-off *SPOILERS*","Fearless meets the Sixth Sense. Except that Fearless was excellent and the Sixth Sense was good. This movie is bad. Hathaway and Wilson have absolutely zero chemistry and all they do is blab on and on about nothing. The other characters walk in and out then disappear, only we hardly realize that since they're barely on screen for more than a minute at a time. By the time the end hits - all involved are greatly relieved that it's over. For everyone."
3,An ok movie.,"My wife did not understand the ending, and to be honest neither did I. But we did like the rest of the movie."
2,The Great Ukrainian tenor Ivan Kozlovsky,"Ivan Kozlovsky, the Great Russian TenorIvan Kozlovsky was the Great Ukrainian tenor but NOT Russian.Title of this CD was created as Russian propaganda. They use some latests records of Ivan Kozlovsky when he already was old. Some recordings are OK.But if you want to hear voice of young Ivan Kozlovsky where hesings Ukrainian opera arias go to web site:http://www.orpheusandlyra.com/Kozlovsky.html"
4,Nostalgia looms,"I thoroughly enjoyed the book. Ms. Holland and I grew up 3 blocks from each other, but we never met. She prompted some memories I had forgotten about that special era of the 50s. Thanks, Barbara"
3,Minolta HTsi Plus AF Camera,"This has been a great camera for 3 years and 2000 pictures. However it recently has been giving me some trouble. It is now at Minolta getting fixed for $130.00. The first thing that happened was the built in flash would not fire anymore. Then a few weeks later the camera would not even power up. This camera has taken alot of great pictures for me I was just a little disapointed it just quit on me. The only cons I would say about the camera is no Date Imprinting,no Depth of field check. There also is no Panoramic mode and the XI 3500 flash I used when, on the camera hotshoe the red eye function would not work. It is a good camera I would just recomend an extended warranty."
4,technical information,THe product was exactly as described and I would buy future items from this seller
2,5 editors and a proofreader walk into a bar...,"(The following comments pertain to the Sixth printing: June 2009 copy of the book)As noted by other reviewers, this version is riddled with numerous (and, in some cases, serious) errors that severely affect the overall worth of the book. In particular, Lesson 19 ""Positioning Two Columns with a Header and a Footer"" is the victim of an almost complete lack of editing/proofreading. I challenge anyone to follow the directions in this section and come out on the other side with anything that looks like the example in the lesson. The first few chapters are serviceable; the rest is hit or miss from what I experienced. Too bad."
2,service engine light,This cap has caused my 'tighten gas cap' light to alert numerous times. I had a hard time making it fit so i'll not smell gas fumes when opening the driver side door after a trip. If you are buying this product for a 2004 silverado I would consider spending an extra 5 or 10 bucks on a cap that wont give you mentioned problems.
1,Junk,"I wish someone would have told me that this locking cap is a pain in the butt to operate before I purchased it. Don't put it on without some practice first, then consider that the little metal guard over the key hole is going to make unlocking even more difficult. I threw it away because it was too much work."
2,Serves the Function but Cheaply Made,"This gas lock is VERY cheaply made! Turned it the wrong way with the key in ONE time wrong, and the whole assembly/lock mechanism CAME OUT ON THE KEY! BUYER BEWARE! Follow the instructions to the letter!"
1,Doesn't do anything very well,"1. Streaming audio (C-) - Using either Windows Media Connect or the poor D-Link server in a sampling of about 100/2300 songs (WMA, MP3) (~250 albums) at least 10 percent stall and play eradically. My Roku M1000 navigates and plays these audio files perfectly.2. JPEG rendering (D)is very slow and worse.3. Video (AVI) (F) - Would not play any using D-Link server or Windows Media Connect server. Using TVersity server am able to play two or three until unit hangs and has to be rebooted.The remote (C-) feels like a toy and the proximity of the buttons is probably adequate for a childs hands.General usability of UI and navigation (C-)- D-Link designers really missed an opportunity given the fact that the user must use a TV or VGA equivalent screen.Support (F) A call to D-Link support regarding the audio file problems was a waste of time."
3,Not That Impressed....,"I purchased this media player after using a Tivo box for the same type of wireless streaming from my pc. The Tivo box had to be moved into another room so I needed something to replace it.The review... I'm not at all impressed with the speed of this media player over a basic wireless g network. The player loses it's connection and also takes too much time to load pictures. The indexing ability is poor if you have many photos in multiple directories. The internet streaming of Live365 and others web sites is cool but not that useful to me.Use Tivo to stream content, it's much better."
4,Does what it says on the can,"Opened the box, ten minutes later I'm streaming MP3 through my stereo. I got the hang of the controller and the TV interface before reading the manual supplied in pdf form. Shame I can't easily get back to the screen showing the currently playing track once I have navigated elsewhere. Otherwise, I'm delighted. If you are unsure, have a sensibly installed, modern wireless router then buy this, it's so cheap, what's the gamble?"
2,DO NOT PURCHASE FOR ITS XVID/DIVX SUPPORT,"The feature that originally sold me on the DSM-320 was its support for the XviD and DivX formats. These, however, are the two formats that are supported the least, and a slow, jerky, framerate should be expected. I at first thought it was a bandwidth issue, and proceeded to hard wire it to my computer using a crossover cable, the framerate improved, but not enough, in my opinion, for this device to even claim support for these file types. If support for these two formats are the selling feature for you, be warned, you should look elsewhere."
1,"A lot of potential, but does not meet expectations...","I have had the DSM-320 for six months. It does NOT play DIVX (only some XVIDs with the audio out of sync), but the radio functionality is great!Firmware updtates are done every fifth to seventh year, so don't buy this mediaplyer in expectation of having a working product in the near future. It has still got more bugs than an African youth hostel. If you need AOL radio it is a great buy, but for anything else it is slooooooow, unreliable and very, very annoying...Check out this forum before you buy it: //p214.ezboard.com/fdsm320frm13"
1,Not ready for Wireless,"Installation was very difficult. Printed documents poor. On-line documents not much better. I learned the most from someone's review. A call to the vendor was very helpful. After I finally (6 hours) got it set up, I found that music buffered in mid-song. (Not quite what I was expecting.) My router was less than 20 feet way from the unit on the other side of two sheet rock walls. So I shouldn't have this kind of problem. I returned the unit to Amazon. BTW, Amazon was great - very prompt with the refund."
2,Love the product but didn't receive it!,"I have good skin for a 50+ woman. I used to have a European give me regular facials and microderm abrasion treatments. The one product that she used that I purchased and was never without was this. It calms the skin. I used it right after washing my face or coming out of the shower. It smells wonderful, but more importantly is a great protector. It is good on my skin (which is quite sensitive) under other products and I think it cleared up rosacea.The bad news is, the company I ordered it from via Amazon sent a completely different product. It was a hassle to package it back up and send it back and I have yet to receive the (rather pricey) Rose D'Orient that I ordered. I guess I don't trust ordering things that don't come directly from Amazon any more."
2,Too poppy,"David Bowie seems to have gotten pulled into the candy-coated simplistic pop rock genre that dominates MTV and radios all over the US.His new album lacks the unique and artistic style of usual David Bowie. Too many generic drum and guitar tracks.Don't bother. If you're interested in buying anything, buy Space Oddity, the best album ever made."
5,"This is an odd understated cd, a bit better than Earthling",What's amazing about this album is it's unique subtext--lyrical and musical. What Bowie does here is take a look at the past and present through the eyes of a man in his mid 50's -who may or may not be Bowie- but who is yearning for something not quite defined. The musical references are largely to his own body of work. This is another classic from an artist who is still essential.
3,COMO QUE LE FALTA GALLETA,"Soy fan de Bowie y tengo casi todos sus discos. De los que ha producido en la presente decada creo que este ha sido el más esperado y el que, si bien no defraudó, tampoco cumplió con todas las expectativas. Sus dos anteriores discos son bastante consistentes, uno es todo un concepto y el otro guarda muy bien la linea canción tras canción. Pero 'hours' nos deja con la sensación que algo le ha faltado a Bowie. Hay temas grandiosos como 'Thursday's child'o 'If i'm dreming my life', pero otros temas como 'What's really happening' creo que entran de relleno si tomamos en cuenta la capacidad creativa de este genio. Este nuevo material de Bowie sólo queda como un buen disco sin más."
1,wednesday's adult?,"Diary of an unfulfilled pop star or sympathy card to his generation? Does it matter? Bowie's 23rd album spares us another round of trend-hopping, opting for a more believable adult-contemporary groove, but his pathological ironic detachment makes him hard to take seriously as Love's Survivor. Even so, this album didn't have to be so weak -- the emotional heft in Bowie's songs has never come from him but his guitarists, from Mick Ronson to Stevie Ray Vaughan. A pity that Reeves Gabrels is such a cipher. His latest collaboration with Bowie is typically stagnant; bloodless guitars and synths substitute half-baked ""moods"" for genuine emotions. As for lyrics, take your pick from obtuse, half-finished or banal. ""Sometimes I cry my heart to sleep ... Sometimes my courage fell to my feet,"" the auteur laments in ""Thursday's Child."" That would be drippy even if it didn't come from a billionaire married to a supermodel."
2,"David, what were you thinking?","This album is one of the most morose, dark, and just plain boring collection of songs I have heard in a long time. I don't know if Bowie was trying to be ""deeper"" than usual, or if he was suffering from some deep depression when he recorded the material, or what, but I did not enjoy listening to this very much. I have every album Bowie has put out, including some imports and hard-to-find selections, and this one rates pretty much at the bottom of my list. Too bad -- some of the songs really had some potential, but they went nowhere in my book."
4,elevator music?,"This CD is a draing contrast to ""Earthling"" and is very good. However, Bowie has an AMAZINGLY strong and rich voice and, in my opinion, he dosen't use it to it's full potential here. This is music I'd play for a romantic dinner at home with my husband. I would like to hear a new Bowie CD where he really utilizes those lungs and gived us something to sing along to."
2,A bad copy...,"I used to love Bowie and decide to see if I could love him again. I listened to a lot of his latter work on youtube and liked what I heard of Hours so I ordered this version of it but found it was a poorly made reproduction of the original. Many of the songs have been slowed down to the point that they sound out of tune. Yet when I listen to the same song, from the same album on Youtube, I like it and it isn't out of tune.I don't know if this is a poorly made bootleg or what."
3,Bit Disappointed,"I must admit I was hoping for an album that would take Outside and Earthling a bit further and was very surprised to hear how mellow the album was. There's nothing wrong with mellow, but after listening to the album several times, I just found it boring, with most of the songs just blending into each other. I found the best song to be Track 6, ""What's Really Happening"", but other than that nothing really jumped out at me."
1,Would be Nice to use it first,"I have had this product for about 4-5 weeks now and I have yet to get it to work. I contacted Talismoon and I'm still waiting for a driver for my vista machine. On the product page it says nothing about this product not working with Vista any where. So until I can use the product it will just sit on my desk tell I get some answers. I have to say that the only guy that helped me was one of the tech guys he contacted the product producer and asked for a driver for me, they replied they didn't make one so I'm screwed tell they make one. But for the product I have to say if you plan to market a device, product, merchandise make sure it works for what its supposed to work for. As far as using Amazon all was good I have never had a problem with Amazon they are one of the best in the Internet marketplace."
2,Leslie West.....,"Leslie West is said to be Jeff Beck's favoite guitarist. That was over 30 years ago...now Leslie is just a shadow of his former self in more ways than one. There are really no memorable guitar solos on this entire album; plus his classic Les Paul Junior ""tube"" tone & vibrato are no where to be found. No really good songs or even guitar riffs either. I could not even listen to it all the way thru. If you want flat out...to the wall rock, pick up the new Blue Oyster Cult, Status Quo, or Ted Nugent cds; wait for this one to hit the cut-out bin."
2,Great magazine but poor custumer service,"I've had a one year subscription. Firt issue came with not problems but eventually issues stopped coming.I called custumers services (CS) and they send me a duplicate from the previous issue plus the current one.Then I realize that the issues weren't coming and called CS again!!! (which doesn't have bilingual personnel in order to express myself better).By the way, the renewal reminders doesn't have any delays which bothers me a lot.Indeed, I have to deal with CS 3 or 4 times. It's a shame that such a good publication had such a bad service."
4,Good customer service,"Product was shipped promptly and accurately, came exactly as ordered.Price was 2/3 of what it would have cost here in Canada at my local Honda dealer.I have not put it on my bike yet but am confident from previous experience with K&N; that it will work well and pay for itself over the life of my bike."
2,Watch out for their Return Policy,Very difficult to return. They had a 15% restocking fee and I had to pay to return the product so I kept it. Won't be buying from K&N again.
1,Equivalent,"I received the product today only to find that it was not what was ordered. I ordered a K&N; Air filter and received an product I am unfamiliar with called DNA Air filter from a company in Greece.I contacted the seller and they were very cooperative in resolving the order. As it turned out, the DNA product was of same or better value so I decided to keep the filter"
5,"Great filter, great deal.",This is a great deal on a well known air filter. Anyone who is a gear head knows who K&N is. Can't beat the price either. To get a superior air filter that will help your bike breath better for only $15 more than a stock OEM filter is a no brainer. Came fast and fit perfectly. My only complaint is that no where on the box does it say its already oiled and ready to go. Had to find that out on the internet. Otherwise I had no regrets.
4,Great Filter,"I use K&N air filters on all my vehicles, to include my FJR1300. All have offered better performance than the stock filters. I must say that they MUST be maintained properly to get optimal performance, and not damage intake components. Most folks over oil these filters or do not clean them properly. If the manufacture's instructions are followed, you'll get great performance and long-life with these filters."
4,K&N on an 07 KLX250s,"I bought this K&N air filter for my 2007 KLX 250s Dual Sport. It was a little tricky getting it to fit because the outer cap bottoms out on the inside of the air-box. Also had to file down the threads on the wing-nut bolt just a little bit so the filter would seat good. Once I got it in there, I could immediately tell a difference in the increase of power. I would definitely recommend this product for the 2007 Kawasaki KLX 250s."
3,a reverse propaganda film?,"With blue eyes and near blond hair Greta Scacchi just doesn't seem very Cuban?The film seems to be trying to get Cubans in Miami to not resist Castro?The film has a flimsy triangle of the boat owner who rescued the wife and thejournalist who was a political prisoner. Having just seen a filmabout ""disappeared"" in Latin America this film is a real contrast.Both sides seem bent on getting rid of all opposition byany and all means. A large number of Cubans are in a Ghettoin Miami and will probably remain there. It is in the interestof the US government that they don't make any waves.So I take this film with the non-Cuban ( Italian) lead asbeing a propaganda film. The US government is waiting for Castro to die."
4,"So far, so good","As a teacher, I wanted a pencil sharpener that was going to sharpen consistently and last for a while. When it comes to buying an electric pencil sharpener, it seems to be a big gamble no matter which one you go with. After looking at several brands in different price ranges, I settled on this particular sharpener. So far it has sharpened consistently. I have sharpened over 500 pencils and every pencil sharpens to a nice fine point. The only drawback with this sharpener that I have found is the shavings collector has to be emptied after about 10 to 15 new unsharpened pencils. Other than that, I have been super pleased with my purchase. Based on previous experience with electric pencil sharpeners, I can't give it 5 stars until I see how long it is going to last."
5,Great!,"Amazing! I teach elementary school, and have gone through many electric pencil sharpeners in the past. This is by far, the BEST pencil sharpener I've tried! It sharpens dull pencils in about 2 seconds (to a very sharp point), and new pencils in about 5 seconds. My kids were amazed too! Great buy!"
5,Will alter your view of the importance of birth order,I have used this book as a textbook in several of my colleges classes and have found it to be most enlightening in giving students a better understanding of family and social change. Highly recommended to better understand that it is not so much soicioecomic factors but sibling rivaly that induces personal and social change.
2,this ain't science,"Although the data supporting his hypothesis look very impressive and almost convincing, the problem I have with this book it that Mr Sulloway picks his Revolutionary Theories for reasons that are dubious. For example, excluding certain theories on the basis that ""they would have been discovered by others around the same time"" can hardly be called scientific. And then, after lots of very impressive statistics, he wanders off into the land of anecdotal evidence science that makes the reader wonder why he's working at MIT in the first place. Although there is probably a basis for some of his conclusions, and it is a great effort to bring science to this subject of popular prejudice, I can't support the raving reviews it received in the press."
4,Worth it!,"Did you ever have the feeling that you read a different book altogether?I found Prof. Sulloway's work to be highly revealing. He obviously managed to bring this topic from coffee table discussion to true scientific value. I am a bit confused as to the criticism of other readers however. If one were not to use multi-variate statistics, pray tell how would one go about proving or disproving any social theory? The historical examples, as I understand them, are a means for the reader to understand the significance of the data, which was obviously well documented.Clearly human behavior cannot be determined 100% from research, but it does point to significant tendencies. I found the book highly informative and well worth the effort."
2,"Bass, bass, and nothing but bass","These things have nothing but bass. I like bass, but it's ridiculous. You can't turn it down or control it. Forget about using these on iPods or anything where you can't really adjust the base pre-amp. And even when you can, the bass is so strong, it's impossible to get decent sound. You may hear no words to the songs, and you may not be able to distinguish any instruments, but you will hear and feel the base 18 houses down the block. If you are not using this with a computer which gives you full control of the sound, DO NOT BUY."
4,Good product for it's price range,"This is a good product for what your pay for it, I don't know if there are any better p/c speakers in this price range but I did end up purchasing a pair of Klipsch 2.1 speakers after I bought these only because the total wattage these put out wasn't loud enough for what I wanted, but you could do alot worse if they only put out 50 watts rms, I would have been totally satisfied with these."
3,Ok for cheap speakers . . . But . . .,"I should have stepped up one notch. The sub doesn't have much punch (again you get what you pay for) but the two speakers themselves are alright.It's not that I'm dissatisfied, it's just that I was considering this set or the Logitech x-230 and chose this one based on some other reviews and to save a few bucks. Now that they've arrived I'll be able to live with them just fine ---- still, if I were to do this again I would spend the few extra dollars for better speakers."
4,Nice sound at a good price,The speakers have a really nice full sound. I'm not sure you can go wrong for the price. They also look really sharp. My only complaint is that there is not a button to adjust the bass. What you have is what you have; regardless of wanting more or less bass. For myself I don't really care; I think the sound is stellar as it is but it really bugs my husband.
4,Pure enjoyment,"This film is one of my favorites. Angela Lansbury is at her best. The film gives a real insight into family relationships. This is not surprising as Rosamonde Picher's books have much in family life, loves and troubles. I hesitate to say it, but Shell Seekers is really a woman's film."
5,works great,The celadrin combined with borage oil keeps the pain and swelling of my arthritis at bay. If I miss a couple days it starts back so I know the stuff works. So glad not to be in pain any more.
5,The Smithy Miracles,"An uplifting journey. Glover reminds us to look for beauty and joy in the simplicity of nature, to cherish everyday works of kindness and that home is carried in the heart."
4,Fun to dance to,This collection of music is so cool. It gives you a quick glimpse of alot of different artists. It has nice catchy tunes all through the cd.
2,"OK, but flimsy.","Yes, it works. Yes, it's slow. But the biggest problem is that after using it only a handful of times, it just broke. There's no longer any tension in the point - if you press on it, it just pushes right up and retracts into the head. Can't see any way to fix it - the head doesn't have normal screws so I can't open it (I did take the tip off, but the problem is beyond that). Unfortunately, we've had it for a while so returning it isn't an option. Guess it's going right into the trash. I'm getting tired of these relatively expensive kids' toys that break so easily."
1,UNRELIABLE AND CHEEP,"I bought this item thinking it was a thrifty and reliable way to burn DVDs off my Mac. I made a huge mistake. It takes 10 hours to get these DVDs burn a 45 minute standard definition DVD. I tried playing it back on 5 different DVD players. None of them worked.I have had lots of success with other brands of blank DVD media, such as Staples, Memorex, and Sony. A warning to all those people who want a good buy on blank DVDs: You are getting only 1/5 of what you pay."
3,Split Culture,"These short stories were fun to read. I expected something like this from Rushdie, of which I had only read a college commencement speech and two pages from a novel. The East stories leave me a little more confused and mystified than the West, and the East, West fall on both sides. This makes sense as there is a North, South split in my own life. A good introduction to Rushdie I guess? The first few pages of Satanic Verses won't feel as odd or unexpected after this."
3,Eclectic. a hodge podge of Britain and India.,"East West is not one of the best collection of short stories that I have read, butit certainly is very entertaining. Rushdie's tongue-in-cheek style shows through in the ""prophet's hair"". Witty and funny. Love the irreverent way he weaves in details, which to me makes his writing so enjoyable. Definitely a decent read."
5,"If you buy only one country CD this year, make it this one..","-Take it from me, fearless music lover, this is the best Johnny Cash CD you can buy. A fine, fine addition to any collection whether your tastes lean towards Steve Earle or more towards the Meat Puppets.This CD (this very one) is doubtless what inspires songwriters when they list Johnny Cash as one of their influences. It's old but not dated. It's been heard before yet still hits you where it counts....Is that a good-enough testimonial? I think so."
2,"Cute, but a little thin","Drew is always a sight, but the story was thin. The quality of the picture was good, so was the sound."
2,Lame,If you want quality buy MiddleMarch or Pride and Prejudice. This 11 hour saga bored me. Perhaps the tempo is better suited for novel form because I found the miniseries slow and painful. I also have gripes about steamrolling the plot into religion at the 11th hour and about resolving major conflict offscreen.The cast is stellar. The country is beautiful. It's everything else I don't like.
1,Not for MY family!,"If you know about this already then my review won't matter to you. But if you're in general a BBC fan, this is SO sexually ambiguous - or it wants to be but it's not - you may want to keep it from children. There is nothing graphic or obvious but the interest shown between the feminine boys in the movie just is not balanced enough."
1,Blu-Ray version washed out and colorless,"This is one of my favorite tv shows of all time, but I have never been so disappointed in any product as I was with this one. Don't bother buying the Blu-Ray version. It has been remastered in some way for high definition that results in a flat, colorless picture that is overly bright and has little detail. (I had the same problem with the new version of Upstairs-Downstairs, also by Acorn Media.) I watched about fifteen minutes of it before I gave up and got out the DVD version and watched it on my up-converting DVD player. With the DVD version, the picture is a little blurry, but at least there is color and detail, and the picture is not flat. If you already have it on DVD, leave well enough alone. If you don't have it at all don't buy the Blu-Ray version, invest in a $50 up-converting DVD player instead."
4,"Good compromises, but disc 3 a little crowded","The restoration is gorgeous and overall the balance between material length and compression is great. But there's a slight hitch. BRIDESHEAD was 11 episodes long, with episodes 1 and 11 around 100 minutes each, and episodes 2-10 were around 50 minutes each. So, disc 1 (eps. 1-3) and disc 2 (eps. 4-7) hold ~200 minutes each, while disc 3 (eps. 8-11) has ~250 minutes crammed onto it. And it shows. The compression rate is so high that you can see wainscotting on the walls waver and flat patches of color. It *IS* ignorable and the episodes are watchable, especially if you're a regular viewer and not a hypersensitive resolution-junkie addicted to Superbit discs. :^) But if you are one of those poor sharp-eyed souls, realize that there has been a compromise."
2,Bird is always bird,"Its ok for a single DVD. However, if you are looking for an extended documentary on his life, buy the big 4 or 5 DVD volume by Ken Burns, there's nothing like it, and it spends quite a lot of time on Bird. Its a must-have for jazz fans."
4,throwing aid,Gt to get a copy of mary chappelhow's book - very helpful to get help a budding potter.
2,A 250 page CV on how Clive James became an intellectual,"Having so much enjoyed the first two volumnes in this series, I was not prepared for this turgid list of self improvement. Yes Clive is well read, English and Italian, yes he does know the difference between a Donatello and a Michelangelo, but do we need to know every book he read in the two years, every painting he saw and how it moved him. The simple answer is no. Unfortunately it takes 250 pages to find out.The story of how a drunken extemely funny youth becomes a sober mildly funny old pseud."
3,Tweezers,"my order was received very quickly, however I received a red pair of tweezers when I really wanted the purple ones that were shown on the pic, they work great but I really wanted the purple ones."
3,"More fat, less filling","Or I was gonna title the review ""Going For The Two...""This box set has many strong selling points, but it also has some negative aspects. It provides more comprehensive coverage of Yes's career than their previous ""YesYears"" box, but that means more of the boring material they put out in the 2nd half of the '80s and in the '90s. Roughly 40 percent of the songs on In A Word are also on Yes Years, so the band could have at least replaced those to make the two sets complementary rather than competitive. The new set will undoubtedly be received as ""the great Yes box we've all been waiting for,"" but in my view ""YesYears"" is a much better collection of music."
2,What a disappointment...,"I agree wholeheartedly with the first reviewer- what is the point of this boxed set? I have YesYears as well, and almost every other Yes cd. This boxed set adds very little that is new, and might only be worth buying for someone without any Yes cd's, or who is new to listening to the band. Other boxed sets (Jethro Tull, Bob Dylan, Bruce Springsteen, Eric Clapton, etc.) were done very well by their respective record companies, and make a lot of sense.The one good thing about this box set is that (supposedly) all the music was remastered. If Rhino goes back and re-releases some of Yes's albums with bonus tracks (as they are doing for the band Chicago), I would definitely be interested in buying that."
5,This one's a keeper!,"Chance of a Lifetime is Amy's Leigh's first novel, and what a treat it is! It's humorous, heartwarming, and the characters practically leap off the page they're so real-to-life. Ms. Leigh does an excellent job of creating regional flavor and dialogue, and the ending sent me rushing for my hankie. This is definitely a romance author you'll want to keep an eye on!"
3,didn't do much for me.,"I was in labor for 23 hours, so I don't think it did much for me. Doesn't hurt to try though. I have heard it works for a lot of people."
5,Wow--What a Fascinating Book,I thoroughly enjoyed the portrayal of the life and times of Sweetwater as well as what it was like to be a WASP in a small Texas town!
4,"""It seems I'm some kind of Galactic yo-yo!""","An unidentified flying object has landed near the Nuton power complex, supplying Britian with safe, cheap energy. The Axons, aliens form the ""far side of the galaxy"", intend to suck the Earth dry of all its energies and leave nothing behind. A good UNIT story. Lots of action, people blowing up, and some of Who's most disgusting lookin aliens. Pertwee and the regulars are great, although Fyler's accent is a little iffy. And why, in a majority of Pertwee stories, when a person is in hospital or sedated, they start to wail on about stopping the Master(see the Daemons)? The story itself might be a little silly for casual viewers, but all in all, a great action-packed psychedelic Who Adventure!"
5,I lived Brian's life with each word I read.,This is the first Morgan Llywelyn book I have read and I can't wait to read more of her books. I loved this book from page one. I fell in love with Brian and felt his pain and victories right along with him. It is a powerful story about a powerful man. I've wanted to go to Ireland for a long time to explore my own family history and after this book I want it even more.
3,"Has its moments, but is mostly inconsistent","The first 150 pages of this book are terrific, and I couldn't put it down, but then it begins to dwindle. Although 550 pages, it really is sparse. It moves through Brian Boru's life with rapid speed, which would be okay if certain parts were emphasized, but Llewelyn doesn't do this. At the end the reader is left unable to seperate any of the battles or achievments of Boru. They all run together. Boru's achievement of conquering Ireland was a life-long struggle, but Llewelyn writes as if there was never any doubt he would conquer Ireland. War is also romaticized, and Boru is portrayed in battle as he is in life - he can't lose. However, the novel was mostly based on facts, and except for a couple characters, Llewelyn writes what really happened. This is refreshing change from the Braveheart-like stories, where more than half of the content of the stories have no historical backing."
5,Wonderful,"Thank you so much, my husband just loved this book, it arrived in just days and was in perfect condition."
4,Great story of some Irish history,"A great read. I wasn't sure what to expect of Brian Boru's life, I'd only heard of him as the name of a few bars ... and maybe a couple drinking songs. His story and that of Ireland make you proud to be of such a strong culture and heritage."
1,How disappointing,"Wow. I was hoping this was going to be so good. It was my pick to jump start my summer reading binge. Maybe I'm spoiled after reading ""Cooking for Mr. Latte"" and ""A Homemade Life"", but this is just painful to even attempt to finish. I'm trying my darnedest too, but it's slow, neurotic (not in a good way), and the cooking is such a miniscule part of the whole darned thing. How did she get a book deal? I hope the movie is ok, maybe that can salvage this, because man, the book is already in my donate box. Not even going to TRY to resell the darn thing."
2,Not worth the time to read it,"I read this for a book club this summer and was immediately assailed by the profanity and the sexual comments. Somewhere this woman got stuck in adolescent sex dreams! Thought it would be more comedic in nature. Ms. Powell has a knack with words and especially descriptive passages but she wallows in self-indulgence way too much. Reads like a Valley girl novel - all about me!!!!!!! UGH! Don't waste your time unless you like self-indulgent, self-important bloggers who think their thoughts and their lives are the most important thing on the planet. I pray this lady got some perspective. Got to give it to her...it was a great idea for a book and a project. Too bad she sullied up a great idea with alot of sludge."
4,"Great, funny and a pleasure to read!","I don't know why some people are so hard on this book? I thought it was wonderful and read it in about three days. I am already trying to decide which friend I am going to lend it too next.The book is not claiming to be a cookbook or a how-to book. It is exactly how the book jacket describes it though- and I was glad. I love to cook and sometimes consider myself a foodie, and really enjoyed this book. Maybe I just identify with the author because I too have lived in a big city with a small apartment and tiny kitchen and I know what kind of feat it is to cook a big meal.The book is enjoyable and funny!"
1,Very Disappointing,"This book has nothing to teach aspiring foodies about how to cook. The constant references to her sex life and that of her friends is very tiresome, as is the quantity of cuss words, essentially on every page."
1,Movie better than the book,"I have to say for the first time in my life the movie is way better than the book, it is totally disjointed and full of unnecesary profanity. The author comes across as very immature and a total whiner. Don't bother buying it, the movie is much more enjoyable."
1,the worst pages of my reading days,"the soup they made might have been good, but the book sucked. who does she think she is trying to make all those recipes from julia child's cookbook. this book was totally and completely meaningless. julie powell shouldn't have even bothered writing such a terrible book. it almost made me throw up after the first couple of pages. actually, i think i did"
2,Distasteful,"I couldn't get through this book either. I originally picked it up because my name is Julia and my mom's name is Julie...so it was, literally, calling my name. I thought it would be a fun, quirky story of a woman finding herself through food...but instead it was a really abrasive, whiny story about the author, with the occasional mention of Julia Child and French cooking. Just couldn't slog through this one."
2,Not much about Julia only Julie,"Julie Powell is thirty some living in in New York City. One day she decides to make all the recipes in the Julia Child's Mastering the Art of French cooking, that over 500 recipes. Julie is not master chef by any mean. Needless to say it will a adventure. With help from Eric (her husband), friends and the people who are following her blog, Julie tires to do something that very few pepole have attempted to do.""Julie and Julia"" by Julie Powell is a cute book about trying to some that you have never done before. I had hoped that there be more about Julia Child but there wasn't. Overall ""Julia and Julie"" is a cute book but not a keeper."
2,Just ok.,"Too much vulgar , unprofessional, unladylike vocabulary..I don't think Julia wold have used such speechI sort of expected a recipe somewhere along the way."
1,Profanity detracts from material,"I can count on one hand the books I have thrown away in my lifetime of 47 years. I treasure books and respect them, but unfortunately this one had to be kept away from anyone else. I didn't get past the first ten pages. The level of profanity was so distracting that I couldn't focus on what the author was saying. Her writing is rich, and I appreciate that. But the book is now smoldering in our burn barrel outside."
1,Terribly Disappointing,"I was so excited when I got this book. But I am walking away from it completely disappointed. I love Julia Child but didn't see where she was a big part of this book. In my opinion, I didn't understand what Julie Powell was trying to get across to her readers. I was 40 pages into the book and had no idea what I was reading. I thought maybe if I stick it out, things will start to make sense. Well halfway through the book, I was more confused then ever. This book makes no sense. Julie Powell is all over the place with her story. She jumps from one subject to another without finishing what she was talking about in the first place. Very frustrating to follow. By the time I got halfway through this book, I had no idea what I had read. This had to be just about one of the worst books I have ever attempted to read. I won't be finishing it and would not recommend it to anyone that I know or who asks me about it."
2,Would like to see changes in the sellers industry...,"I can't say really, whether the book is awesome or not, as I didn't finish reading it. I would appreciate a rating system, much like the movie industry uses, that would let me know BEFORE I purchase an item if it may contain matter that I find objectionable. That way, I'd save my money for something that I would actually end up enjoying.This book contained extremely strong language, through out the first few chapters, so I didn't ready any further and couldn't tell you if it was great, or if it contained any other objectionable material."
2,"Julia good, Julie lackluster - 2 thumbs down","I wish I hadn't spent $ seeing this since it did bash a political party, which I find divisive for our troubled country right now. Streep's characterization of JC was strong but greatly undermined by a very weak and uninspiring depiction of Julia Powell. More Julie than Julia made for a recipe of too much Julie and not enough Julia to make the film worth it.Here is something tongue in cheek to watch though (: [...]"
4,"A good summer book. Entertaining, easy, funny.","I loved this book. It is funny, easy to read, well written, and entertaining. No, I did no ""learn"" anything about cooking but it was engaging, laugh-out-loud funny in spots, and just a good summer read. I recommend this book for someone looking for a light, easy, book for reading at the beach, or on a plane.Enjoy!"
2,Profanity abounds!,"I was, quite frankly, shocked at the language used! I saw the movie first and just loved it so I was not prepared for the liberal use of the ""f"" word and taking the Lord's name in vain so many times! I'm surprised that someone made a movie out of it! Sometimes swearing or cursing is part of the nature of a story and more or less expected - but it was totaly out of character for this book!"
2,Somebody & Julia Child,"Horrid book. Who cares about a pain-in-the-behind whiner living in Brooklyn? Skip all of the bits about the New Yorker and move straight to Julia...or better yet, see the movie and buy MY LIFE IN FRANCE by Julia Child."
1,not worth the read,"I began this book the day after I finished Julia Child's ""My Life in France."" Julie Powell admits in the onset of the book that the ""memoirs"" of JC are often fiction. That is true and I find it an embarrassment to a great woman.Julie Powell is not a polished author and her prose is generally nothing more than what you would find in a silly, young woman's diary.Buy Julia Child's book, it IS worth the money."
2,funny but disappointing,"The vapid prejudice was unappealing. Of course its ok to disagree with a set of political ideas. The blessing of America as we can all disagree openly. But to just randomly name ""republicans"" as the evil guys in the world in the name of humor is not funny and reveals prejudice...Too bad as the book surely has its funny bits. It rawly shares a vulnerability which has a real appeal."
1,Not a Child and not a Reichel -- what is this?,"As an avid cookbook and memoir reader, this had great promise -- as did Miriam's Kitchen for example, which it delivered -- but this was not a good read, not a good insight except into continual expression of frustration about vocation, living conditions, lack of culinary background or skill, . . . good venting, poor reading."
2,I tried,"I wanted to like this book. I've curled up with it a couple times now, thinking that I was just being difficult and should give it another chance. I absolutely love Laurie Colwin's writing, surely I should enjoy this. But I just didn't. I can't explain why sometimes cranky writing is warm and endearing and sometimes it isn't, but something is lacking in this book. And while it's true that she tracks down such things as bone marrow and squab for authenticity's sake, she misses another recipe's texture completely because she doesn't have a cooking thermometer. Surely every grocery store with even a handful of implements for sale offers a cooking thermometer (probably for less than the cost of a squab)?"
1,Dazed and Confused,"I had such high hopes for this book and I was looking forward to reading Julie and Julia. Now that I have started it I'm forcing myself to finish it. I'm so disappointed in the book I don't even know where to start. First let me say that I am a TEXAN and I love Julia Child, I grew up watching her on PBS, and this book is a Total let down. I didn't expect to read about Julie's childhood or her issues with her husband and family. I thought I was going to read a diary of sorts. I'm confused as to why everyone has ranted and raved about this book. I'm more than halfway through the book and as I read on my eyes glaze over and my mind drifts and I have to force myself to concentrate on reading...I just hope I make it to the end. If you want a good read, read Amanda Hesser's ""Cooking for Mr. Latte"", she talks about Julia Child and it's a great book!"
2,Only so I could see the movie,I bought the book when the movie first came out. I always promise myself that I will try to read a book before I see the movie if I think it will be worth the effort. The book did make me want to take a cooking class and definitely made me laugh a few times but I think it was a little long. I was getting tired of the author at the end with her bitching. I would love to read her newspaper articles since those would be short and sweet and perfectly suited for her writing. Do NOT bother seeing the movie!
1,Nothing like the movie,"Pretty disappointed with this book after watching the movie. A lot of times the book is much better than the movie, in this case, it was the exact opposite. A big part of this is the excessive use of profanity. Don't let your kids pick this up around the house. Needless to say, we took this copy out of circulation."
1,I can't believe I spent money on the hardcover version,"I was excited to purchase this book and read about the daunting task of cooking through Mastering the Art of French Cooking. It was one of the worst books I have ever read. The author is a whining, self-centered, profane individual-no wonder Julia Child refused to connect with her. Living near Santa Barbara, many of us have had contact with Mrs. Child, and her joy of life and courtesy to all came across beautifully. The movie was good-the premise of cooking through French Cooking great-I bet Julia Child would have loved to meet the movie's more likeable and gracious character. I had to stop reading this horrible, trashy book not quite half-way through, then skimmed the ending. Sad"
1,Could not finish,"I was not expecting this to be great literature or anything, but I at least thought it might be a breezy, fun summer read. I was wrong. This book is SO tedious. I found myself skipping entire sections, hoping that the story would pick up. It never did, and I finally put it down around page 50 or so. Powell is just not a good writer at all. Blogging about dinner is probably right up her alley as a writer. I saw the movie which was thankfully much, much better. The movie took out all the parts of the book that just didn't do anything for me, like her brother ""Heathcliff"" and her dad's birthday dinner. As a reader, you wonder why she includes all that stuff. It just seemed like ""filler"" to me."
5,"A fun, irreverent read","I read this book under the old title, too-- still not sure how folks might have mistaked it as a cookbook! Or a ""serious"" food book. The author has an irreverent, caustic, yet accessible style of writing that I could really relate to and enjoy-- even though I do not at all aspire to ever attempt a similar project in my life. However, it has inspired me to look at my life and perhaps attempt to do something which might not make a bit of practical sense, but may enrich me in unforeseen ways as the Julie/Julia Project did for the author. This woman reminds me of a close friend which helped me to enjoy it all the more. It does seem aimed towards a ""younger"" crowd."
1,It stinks.,"Foul language. Filth. Narcissism. Maggots. Ugly attitudes.If any of this sounds good to you, by all means buy it. But after handling this book long enough, I want to wash my hands.Julia Child would smack this author with a frying pan. Anyone who has explored this book for any length of time would make no effort to stop her.Blech."
3,Republicans and Open-Minded Democrats Should Steer Clear,"I was so looking forward to reading this book, and kept hoping the digs at Republicans were a one-time thing. They're not--she practically writes more about her hate of Republicans than her cooking. (Even the credits offer up thanks to only the six Democrats at the government agency at which she works.) If you can get beyond that though (I couldn't), you might enjoy the cooking escapades. Too bad she had to make a cooking memoir political, of all things.If you want a great ""foodie"" read, I suggest Amanda Hesser's ""Cooking for Mr. Latte"" instead--a good story and good recipes."
1,"Trashy, gritty book","What a shock to see the darling movie was based on this pile of trash. This woman admitted to working for the government (yes, you and I paid her salary) and bashing the very folks who called in for sympathy or help, including those who lost loved ones on 9-11. Disgraceful... bashes Republicans... obviously another liberal freak who fills the book with low life comments about sex toys and dildos... at least the pages at the beginning (I couldn't stomach any more than about 60 pages)..The worst of all? In the paperback I bought for 13 cents at a library book sale, the first three pages are just full of fabulous paragraphs reviews recommending this book for all to read... our society's sure messed up when literary 'experts' can read and then recommend this trash... Mine goes right where it belongs.. in the dumpster."
5,Go Julie!,"I, too, have been waiting for this book for two years, and it was one of the best books I've read in awhile.Julie, I know you're reading this because I know you. I read your blog back in the day, and back when my job and life in general sucked, too. You were seriously one of the only things I looked forward to in those days (my best friend succumbed to cancer on day 361 of the Project). We all have problems, and we all have to get on with life, despite what gets thrown our way. Your blog made me want to cook again, it made me rethink my career path, and it helped me get back to being me. Thanks a bunch...I didn't donate on the blog, but I did buy the book! Best of luck, and keep writing!"
3,A lite bloggy read,"This book is light and entertaining. Nothing more. Nothing less.If you're looking for something substantive on Julia Child, Mastering the Art of French Cooking, or cooking itself, then this is not the book for you.If you're looking for light bedtime reading that occasionally makes you laugh, pick it up."
4,"excellent, unique, and not for everyone","This is not the same as other books and that obviously offended some people who may be more comfortable with something conventional. I could not put it down. You do not have to agree with everything in a book to like it; the tone was a tad misdirected and even neurotic at times, but it was alive, fresh, and authentic, as les champignons sautés should be."
2,"Tough to put together, and a little chintsy for hard use","My son was throwing the ball at a wall on our house - and the the whole house was shaking! So my wife decided for the safety of house to get him this net. We were gone when the package came, but he went right to work putting it together. He used a lot of masking tape and had a few pieces left over, and also couldn't figure out how to get the net put on correctly. I tried to straighten in out - but then my wife ended up taking the whole thing apart and put it together correctly the next day. It looks nice, but really is a little bit light weight for a twelve year old. It might be a useful toy for T-Ball. I don't think my son is using it that much. But what can you expect for this price?"
3,A Shoddy Reproduction,"The content of A History of Egypt is without peer and essential to ones understanding of this ancient civilization. However, the reproduction of the original text and photographs is unworthy of its author and his work. Broken type, such as many a dot-less lower-case ""i"" and arm-less lower case ""r"" is a constant irritant and source of confusion throughout its 600 pages. The original photographs have lost much valuable detail, bordering on worthlessness. A long-ago reader's inane underlining, imbedded in the source text, is carefully preserved in defiance of our digital age. Surely a better source copy could have been found resulting in a cleaner edition, I am appalled to think that Amazon would permit such a shoddy reproduction to leave its premises without due warning."
2,Hopelessly Outdated,"Yes, it is a pleasant, lightweight read, but contrary to some of the other reviews here, this book is not ""somewhat"" outdated - - it is completely outdated. Anyone who knows anything about Ancient Egypt can just look at the inaccurate information in some of these reviews and see how misinformed readers of this book will be -- for example Thuthmosis III (the accepted ""modern"" spelling is Thutmose from the Egyptian transliteration, more closely Djehutymose) was not 4'6"" -- that is a measurement of his mummy, minus his detached feet and lower legs. He more likely was about 5'6"" tall, a very respectable height for an ancient Egyptian. As for Thutmose III being a ""hero,"" this is a man who, solely for profit, invaded foreign countries, killing, maiming and plundering, carrying goods and slaves back to Egypt, leaving countless impoverished widows and orphans in his wake. It is so sad to think that a mass murderer is anyone's definition of a ""hero."""
3,"Easy to Use, but not a proper swaddle","I bought this and used it for a couple weeks. It was warm and cozy for my daughter. She was a very collicky baby, and I learned from ""Happiest Baby on the Block"" a proper swaddle keeps a baby's arms at his/her side. My daughter's arms could go anywhere no matter how tight I velcroed the Swaddleme. I learned how to properly swaddle a baby from the book mentioned above using stretchy receiving blankets and secured them with a diaper pin. My daughter slept much better that way."
3,"A little too stretchy, but a great product","This material is a little bit on the stretchy side and my little girl manages to wiggle her arms free, but it is lightweight and much cooler (temp wise) than the microfleece ones."
4,Good swaddle blanket for a newborn,"My son was colicky and swaddling really helped. This blanket worked well for him in the first month or so of his life, but then he got stronger and started breaking free of it. We moved up to the miracle blanket which is alot more secure with no velcro."
3,Depends on the baby!,"This is a nice item, but our daughter hated to be swaddled, so it didn't work for us. Swaddling isn't that hard once you've done it a couple of times, so I don't think this product is necessary. It is a good price, so if you think you need it you can always run out and get one. It's not something worth registering for in my opinion."
1,My daughter could get her arms out,"I was very disappointed in this item. My daughter could easily pull her arms out, no matter how tightly we tried to close it. It didn't hold nearly as well as the Miracle Blanket. Although swaddling worked wonderfully for us, this product did not."
3,blankets are better...,If you want a really effective swaddle just get an oversized blanket. These don't swaddle the legs/ lower body tight enough.
4,Nice Swaddler,"This is the only swaddler I used with my daughter. I had no problems with it. The only thing I would mention is that this one was a thin cotton, while the other one I had was fleece. I recommend you decide which one to buy based on the season. This one filled its purpose."
3,It works for a while...,"I do like this product and use them for my twin girls, however, the sides of the wrap are really low so they end up getting their arms out really easily. This pretty much defeats the purpose of the wrap if their arms are out, right? They do work for a while, but if the girls start to squirm, it doesn't do the trick. I like the idea of the wraps, but would try and find one that keeps their arms in a little better."
1,Useless,"Swaddling is great if you use the right blanket, but this one isn't it. It's too stretchy for a tight fit and the ""easy diaper change"" feature makes it too easy for the baby to kick out one or both legs, which just wakes them up. You'd be better off buying a Miracle Blanket. They're more expensive, but they actually work."
5,These are the best!,"Our little 2 month old has been swaddled up nightly in these blankets since we discovered them. We were swaddling her the old-fashioned way in blankets until I found these. These are easy easy easy! Also work great in warm weather, seems like the perfect amount of warmth for her, without her getting overheated even on warm nights. She loves these blankets-- they calm her right now even at her fussiest moments!"
5,A Great Shortcut,"These blankets work great- we have 2 of them. This one is cotton and more lightweight, we also have the same one in a heavier fleecy material. You can't beat the price! After you get the hang of it, you'll find that you can swaddle your baby in 10 seconds, and my 6 week old has been sleeping through the night with this swaddling blanket- 7 to 8 hours uninterrupted! She's about to outgrow it, though. We'll need to order a larger size soon."
3,Nice Idea But...,"I bought several of these because they're inexpensive and a pretty good idea. The reason I only give 3 stars is because the small is too small for my son, and the large is too big. Additionally, the velcro, while an interesting idea, does wake him up, sometimes undoing the work I did to get him sleepy and relaxed. It's not a bad product, but you should look into the miracle blanket and the swaddling blanket by Swaddling Designs. They are pricier but worth it."
2,"Ok, but there are better swaddlers","I have used the small and large size of these swaddlers and wouldn't waste my money again. I have to wrap my son so tight for these to work, that I won't be using them anymore. Too many nights he wakes because his hands escape. It's not worth the disrupted sleep. I liked that these were more affordable than the other ""miracle"" brand, but ended up wasting more money because these didn't work for me. Other swaddling blankets, such as the ""miracle"" blanket do not solely rely on wrapping tight, but also have other tucking aspects that make it effective. If you have a Houdini baby, don't waste your money."
1,not large and not comfortable,"Even though it is described as ""large"", it is not that big I feel. Besides, the scratchy string that linking beads is not bearable."
4,Pressure Tennis,"if you are interested in getting the most out of a tennis practice session, this book has every drill you could ever want to perform."
5,finest deer hunting book ever written,"You must read this book if you are a serious deer hunter. If you are bored with sitting in a blind or tree stand and really want to learn to hunt deer, start here."
4,Young Inventors Run Amok,"This is an appealing story about 12-year-old Millicent Madding, who wants very much to be an inventor. Her parents were inventors. Her aunt and uncle were entertainers of the type who get shot out of cannons. Her aunt, in fact, has never been seen again after being shot out of a cannon twenty years earlier. Now Millicent's parents have disappeared in their newly invented time machine, so she goes to live with her Uncle Phineas. At school Millicent belongs to a secret group of young inventors. Unfortunately, Millicent hasn't really invented anything the group is excited about. And when she invents a scent named Bully-Be-Gone, meant to repel bullies, her invention has the opposite effect: the bullies become enamored of those they had bullied. A crazy mess -- but one that is so satisfactorily resolved, and one that will appeal to middle graders."
1,Never arrived,I ordered this so I could watch it for a paper. Too bad it never arrived and I had to scramble at last minute to find a copy.
3,A World War II Heroine,"This was a pretty solid Hallmark Hall Of Fame made-for-TV story about a real- life woman ""Countess Mary Lindell"" (Judy Davis) who helped Allies during World War II.Many of the military men in need were downed pilots and Lindell would help these men get safely out of occupied France. Her character was a strong one and her resolve to do what she could against the Germans was resolute. Helping her accomplish that were her kids: a son and a daughter (a young Kate Beckinsale!).The story lags in spots or I would have rated it higher. I'd watch this again if someone would issue it on DVD."
1,Does not work with TiVo!!,Do not buy this thinking it is a cheaper alternative to the TiVo branded adapter. I have a dual tuner Series 2 with software version 9.3.It would not recognize this unit. Word to the wise.....
1,To Reiterate VERSION 2 does NOT WORK WITH TIVO,"Version 2 of this adapter will not work with TIVO. TIVO will not recognize this version the WG111. To find the right card make sure to look at the SERIAL NUMBERS on the box. They must start with '130' or 'WG72' if they don't have those serial numbers, you are out of luck."
3,AKJ,"Tried and faced all sorts of problems with Windows XP SP2. Linksys 802.11b router & adapter was working fine. Thought should use this one to boost up my home netwrok speed but didn't happen. After downloading the latest XP2 driver from netgear's site (Last updated Jun 2004!!!!), can able to make it work upto some extent but now not able to connect my work machine using rdp as I have to use VPN software for my work and looks like it conflict with it. Support is not good. They made me do all those things which I had already tried. Even I mentioned the problem and what are the different steps I have already tried, I was asked to repeat them again and once didn't help, they blamed on Microsoft. I tried something on my own to make it work to at least for connecting to internet. Not much reliable and will have to go back to Linksys. Good elegent design is the best feature."
3,"Caution, only certain serial numbers of this model work with tivo",Call Tivo customer service with your serial number before buying.
1,Awful,"I'm normally very cautious when purchasing new hardware and I always shop around for the best deals. In this case, though, I rushed in like a fool and bought this for $50 at Office Depot b/c I really needed Internet access at my new place.This adapter is horrible. It's supposed to get a very strong signal from where I am, but its signal strength is always low when plugged directly into my motherboard. When plugged into a USB 2.0 extension cable, I get very good or excellent signal strength, but it will often lose the signal when under heavy load. This is incredibly frustrating when I want to watch a streaming video, access multiple websites at once, or game. It also runs VERY hot with nothing in the way of keeping it cool. Horrible."
4,A quiet bell,This wagon makes a low ringing sound as the small hammers at each end of the wagon hit the bell when the wagon moves along the track. The resulting sound is a little too low but it is a fun addition to the train collection for young kids to enjoy.
3,"Good, interesting film","... marred due to the fact that Amy Irving cannot act at all, and she's in a pivotal role. Her final ""performance"" in the film is laughable. That, and DePalma's penchant for overkill (the ending especially; the multiple angles were ridiculous)."
1,Disappointed,"I certainly see why Amazon has no 30 second samples to listen to for this album. If they did not many people would buy it. Okay! to be fair; if you are a fan of female pop country then don't read this since it will mislead you, sorry. If you are a fan of raw traditional country and you loved every cut on the second album from Gretchen. I think you will be disappointed. I was"
3,Good price for this product,"Our hair stylist recommended this for my husband to prevent further hair loss. So far we cannot tell the effect as it wouldn't show any effect for at least 6 months. However, the store and Aveda website both sells it for $20 a bottle. And Aveda will charge shipping.We ordered from Amazon vendor 4 bottles and the total with SH + TAX came out to be $54. So, as far as price is concern, I'd buy from this online vendor. Aveda online however, warned me that they could not guarantee the quality if it's not from their registered vendor. I assume that this online store is a registered Aveda vendor. Or is it not? Some else chime in please."
4,Pretty good sequel...,This was pretty good for a sequel but a little more violent than # 1. I wouldn't recommend it for children not use to violence. The story line was okay but just not enough depth to make it better than the first one.
5,One of the Greastest Movies for years and years to come:,"Mr. Tobey Maguire if you read this review I must say to you that your performance as Spider-Man 2 and Peter Parker is one of the best I've seen in years. I'm only hoping that you'll make more of them and not give up on your Spidey Fans. Ms. Dunst and Mr. Molina and others in this Movie all did a Great Job. I recommend this Movie whole-Heartedly to everyone that still believes in Heros. The Movie never slowed for me. I've read some other reviews stating the Movie maybe to long and could have been shortened but I say how when Raimi was and is creating a Character that we all can identify with and believe in and Love for years. Mr. Maguire GOOD JOB! Keep it up because this is one Spidey Fan that Loved this Movie.Smiles, (...)"
2,Hate it!!!!!!!!!!!,"I despise this movie! The first is so much more entertaining. It's 2 hours long, the best part of th emovie is the last 30 minutes. It's so slow and takes FOREVER to get going. Stop the film series! It's time squish the spidey! Bring out the pest control!"
2,Big Fat Letdown,"After the amazing Spider-man, which was full of action, adventure, and intrigue, Spider-Man 2 falls flat. The commercial and ads make it look like it's another Spider-Man, but be warned, it's not. The action scenes you see in the commercials are the only scenes with anything interesting shown in them, and most of the movie is just Peter Parker sitting in his aunt's house drinking tea, and/or hanging out with Mary Jane, who has a more boring character than she did in the first one. This movie has the audacity to call itself an action movie, but it is more of a teen angst drama, with one or two scenes of action. In fact, I do not see why this movie got a PG-13 rating for violence. It's closer to a G. This movie is a BIG letdown after the first one, and it will not be on anyone's future list of favorites (or at least, I hope not)."
2,First one was better,"If I wanted to watch Tobey Macguire whine for two hours, I'd punch him in the stomach. I didn't read the comic book version - is Peter Parker a whiny little dork who feels sorry for himself all the time in the comic? I hope not.Also, the big bad guy descends into lunacy a little quickly for my taste. I'm just not buying it.Other than that, there was some pretty good action scenes, I guess."
1,Spiderman 2 is like a woman soap opera,"BORING! The first spiderman in the best. I just saw part 3 and I didn't think it was all that bad.But part 2 just makes no sense. Such a cliche....poor parker doesn't want to be a good guy anymore and live a lonely life. He wants to be normal. Come on. You have to give me better than that.And the Doc Oc character was pathetic. You need to have a ""bad"" guy people actually care about. You never got to knew anything about him. No development. BORING character.The reason Spiderman 1 is clearly the best is because of the Green Goblin. By far the best character/actor in the series. You believed in the Goblin character and I actually was rooting for him. lolBrilliant acting job!So all you spiderman 2 lovers. Just go watch general hospital or some other cheesy soap opera. Same thing."
2,CRAP! CRAP! MEGA CRAP!!,"Unlike the first Spiderman movie, this one spends too much time on the adolescent turmoil of the lead characters introduced previously. Too much tension has been created between the characters Peter Parker and Mary Jane. Peter's vulnerability has been pathetically over-played. The reincarnation of the Goblin near the end of the movie is what gives me hope that a third movie would help avenge the tragedy of this one."
5,spiderman,"Spiderman #1 was a good movie and the second movie's review's have been very good and I think this movie is a great experience for the whole family. I liked the first a lot, and I'm sure I'll like this one."
1,Very bad movie!,"In my opinion I thought Spiderman 2 was awful. It had a bad dialogue, bad acting, and poor special effects. It's kind of like watching a remake of Superman 2 and 3. It didn't seem like a superhero movie to me. It was more like watching a love story. I do not like love stories much and I was expecting it to be just Spiderman and not some stupid idiot of seeing how much his life sucks and trying to get the girl. I give this movie a D rating because the story was just plain awful. I was about to walk out of the theater during the half of the movie. Only thing that's good about this movie is the scene where the car was crashing through the window that was awesome but the rest of the movie sucked."
3,A Bit Disappointing at Best,"This film was disappointing from the point of elevated expectations after the first film. I can't say that it was a bad movie. On the upside, great special effects. The storyline, on the other hand, was so dark and melancholy that it was a difficult to stay with it to the end. I do hope that there will be more Spiderman movies in the future. I also hope that the writers will lighten up a bit and put some fun back in the movies."
2,VERY dissapointed,"I had waited a LONG time to see the sequel to Spiderman. I had high expectations of this movie and I thought it would strongly surpass the first. When I saw it, I was hugely dissapointed. I feel as though the plot was rather miniscule, there was no excitment. Yes, the special effects in this movie were great, but I wish it had a bit more shock and suprise. And I'm really suprised to see all of the high reviews for this movie. I don't see the greatness in Spiderman 2.I would high recommend NOT seeing this movie in the movies. Wait until it comes out on DVD or VHS, don't wait your money on this great expectation that didn't live up to its toll."
1,"worst movie, ever","What made me cringe the most - aside from the lame acting - was the villian, and the reason why he became one. I'm not a geek trying to point out the obvious, but PLEASE don't insult the moviegoers intelligence with this pile of crap. Why the tentacles to control the fusion rector (or why the reactor in the first place, I tell you why, to put some more - badly done - CGI in there). At least give us the good old military technology gone bad plot, thats lame too, but at least better then what they came up with.Oh, and don't get me started about his friend - the sulking teenage industrialist - kind of a male version of Paris Hilton. I really wanted to punch this guy.I'd rather sit through a Jar Jar Binks special..."
1,This movie sucks,"How it's possible to make a movie that goes for 1:30 hours and nothing happens? The graphics are so ""good"" that my Half-Life 2 game can go for Oscar for special effects. Did some kids in a school made it?Don't ever buy it. Even don't rent it. I just lost 3.50 in Blockbuster. Not to mention the three hours of my life!"
4,Tobey as Spiderman,I really like Tobey in these movies. Entertaining! Just fun to watch. I would recommend for any age. Give it a try!
5,Spiderman 2: A movie everyone should see.,Spiderman 2 was 10 times better then the first one! It was full of surprizes. Many parts were sad but it was a great movie. The ending was wonderful! I would rate this movie a 5/5. I think this is a movie everyone should see.
5,Parker still has his swagger...,"The sequel to the Marvel block-buster is an instant classic. Spiderman 2 comes action packed with a thicker plot, a tougher nemisis, tons of wit from our favorite smart mouth web-slanger, and of course the movie concludes with an open door to yet another awesome sequel. I enjoyed this movie tremendously, and recommend this as a gift for yourself or someone else. Crazy movie !!"
5,I Hope It's Great!,"Spider-Man is my Faviorte super-hero I was hoping Venom and Kraven The Hunter to be the next villians but I now know it's another cool villian Doc Ock!Doctor Octopus,Lizard,Kraven The Hunter,Rhino,Scorpion and Venom are my favirote villians of all time!I can't wait to sit down and enjoy this movie July,2004!"
5,SPIDERMAN 2 JUST SIMPLY AMAZING!,Even if your not a fan of Spiderman in general you have to like the first and the second additions of these great movies directed by Sam Raimi. The 2nd installment in the series rocked the box office and in 2007 when the thrid movie is to be released is going to be even bigger! This is a must have DVD for anyone!
1,give us a break,how can they expect us to buy this dvd again. When everyone buys this version they will come out with spiderman 2.5 with special commentary by aunt may. Give us a freakin break.
5,Incredible..,"Wow. The fight scenes alone and the -believe it or not-realism, along with a couple of speeches, make this a classic.The writers of this one deserve applause for a down to earth story of a superhero.They kept it true to the comic books, now fix the goblin's outfit, make John Jameson into the man-wolf,and turn Doc Connors into the lizard, and we'll really be turning up the heat!!"
4,Decent,"This was decent. It got into the character some more, but the plot was fairly predictable. The graphics were pretty good and the acting was okay. Would recommend only if you had seen the first one and want to see the sequal."
4,Not as good as the first movie,"I found Spider-Man 2 to be a good movie; however, it was not as good as the first one. There seemed to be a lot more Peter Parker than Spider-Man. The fight scene on the train was very well done, but it was the only ""big"" fight scene in the movie. A majority of the movie revolved around Peter's conflict within himself of whether to continue as Spider-Man and his failing love interest with Mary Jane Watson. It turned out to be a well made movie, but I felt it fell short of its potential."
5,Great value,"We have been using this player for over a year now, not a single problem with it. We have a very large screen Samsung DLP and DVDs look great on it. Absolutely no complaints, would easily recommend this to others looking for a value-oriented, upscaling DVD player."
1,No disc Error,"I'm from Costa Rica, when I receive this unit it's works fine for 2 days, but after that, anytime that I play any disc, a NO DISC ERROR shows on the LED Screen. I hope I can change the Unit for a new one."
3,Does what it promises..just check the fine print,"Yes this DVD player upscales (as opposed to upconverts like the category suggests) to 1080p, outputs HDMI to fulfill DRM & HDCP, and plays video and audio files from a flash drive. However, it'll only play WMV and JPEGs as video formats through the flash drive. This is incredibly poor considering the player itself will play a slew of formats off of DVD & CD media (DVD-R, DVD+R, DVD-RW, DVD+RW, VCD, SVCD, WMA, WMV, MPEG-2, MPEG-4, MP3, CDA, WAV, etc.). Why they didn't program the firmware to work pulling those same formats off of the flash drive I have no idea, but it is the main reason for the average rating. If you plan on never using the USB port then the player works as expected. The upscaling quality is pretty good, but in some cases of ""you get what you pay for,"" this product is no different. There are better quality upscaling players out there if you're willing to pay for them. It is a good player and does as promised for the $90 price tag."
1,Multi-format?,I can't see how a company can advertise a multi-format DVD player that only plays region 1 DVDs. I don't have much use for a DVD player advertised to play PAL as well as NTSC that will not play region 2 DVDs. Pioneer is disceptive in their advertising and this is the last product I buy from them.The picture quality is not bad but it is not worth the price for a non-recorder DVD player. It does upconvert to 1080P through the HDMI cable. I have a 40 inch LCD it it is impossible for me to detect any upgrade of picture quality from this player set to 1080P and another player that plays at 1080I. Less expensive players give just as good a picture. So unless you own a lot of region free PAL DVDs you should choose a different player.
2,Slow,"Disk in and out are slow than my old Poineer. USB only support real USD driver, not my mp3 or hard disk. Support mp4? no! It should say, some of the mp4 format, NOT all mp4.Not worth the money."
3,Upconverting Performance Marginal,"I bought this model to improve my upconverting performance for my legacy DVDs. I had been using my Xbox360 to play DVDs into my 1080P 40"" Samsung LCD TV. After reading a review comparing the Xbox unfavorably to a high-end Denon upconverting DVD player, I decided to look for a better player. I brought home the Pioneer and discovered the Xbox360 performs this task better. Note to self, sales staff typically know NOTHING."
3,The Worst of Phil?,"Anyone who thinks that Powaqqatsi is ""the worst of Phil"" needs to have his head examined."
4,Corr's Live and lively,"Even though this is dated material, the CORRS, in their prime, are a unique and entertaining band. Talented and fun-loving, they have music that ""hooks you"". Almost every song is sing-a-long-able, (new word I created). The special features, also, help educate their fans or fans-to-be about their style and inspiration. But, the music needs no introduction. It is deep, for pop, and danceable. Like ABBA.There is not one song I skip over, after repeated plays. A little over-edited, the video keeps moving. The picture leaves a little to be desired. The fans are engaged by the band to become part of the experience. Fun to watch their reactions."
2,not so much.,"This was 'required reading' for a graduate level course in seminary. I think the author could have boiled it down to 5-6 pages of useful material rather than page after page of reiterating the same thing 3 different ways. By the time I was finished with 1/2 the book - reading the second half was more of a chore than enjoyable/edifying. I'm not an expert in the area angelology, so i'm going to search for a better read for my personal library."
5,A must read for readers of Action and Historical Fiction.,"This book has action, adventure, heroes and villains. Fighting,Sex treachery and loyalty. It's a light easy to read book, that really gets the reader involved with the Characters. I enjoyed it tremendously and recommend it to anyone looking for a light action packed read."
4,High adventure,"Wilbur Smith is a great storyteller. In Birds of Prey he tells the story of young Hal Courtney who is learning the craft of sailing from his stern father. His father's hard discipline will turn out well for the lad as he faces treachery, uncharted lands and seas, and a confrontation of cultures. The setting of this novel is around southern Africa. Smith's research into sailing seems quite throrough as well as his attention to the areas around the Cape of Good Hope in the 17th century. Smith does give his plot away at the beginning, but that does not prohibit the reader from enjoying the playing out of the plot - and sometimes a few surprises as well. This is good reading."
3,Not Terrible,"This really wasn't terrible. It's as good as a ""B"" movie can be. You got three stories, all of them take place in a different room of the same building....LMAO...kind of ridiculous stories. Acting was pretty good though. Rent before you buy. I bought this just cuz it looked like it might be good. I don't regret buying it because I knew what I was getting into, but I'll encourage everyone else to rent."
4,Fundamentals of Management,Fundamentals of Management is a great book to get started in management. It covers everything that you would need to know. I like this book in particular because it has chapter tests at the end of every chapter so that you can kind of test yourself over what you had just did. I also liked how the definitions are out to the side of the reading as well as in bold in the reading. It makes it easy to find the words that you are looking for. I have learned a lot from this book. I went with some experience in managing and still learned something new every time I turned the page. I feel this is a great book to get started with in management.
1,didn't receive book,"i didn't receive the book, Could you please look into this on priority, my semester is half over, can you refund the money back"
4,Tis is a excellent book.,"I feel that the textbook, Fundamentals of Management by Stephen P. Robbins and David A. DeCenzo, is a good book for the beginning management student. The book made use of illustrating it's points by using graphs. This is important for the students who are having a hard time understanding what the author is trying to say. It's hard for someone to succeed at something if they do not understand the different aspects. I would recommend this book to anyone who is planning to have a career in business."
2,Bad to the Bone,"This latest addtion of the ""Instinct"" series finds forensic diva Jessica Coran on the trail of a disturbed serial killer who leaves his victims without their spinal cords but with a lovely charcoal drawing. Paired with a handsome, black FBI agent, Jessica becomes invovled in a a last ditch attempt to free a man from death row.Unfortunately, this is one painful read. The dialogue is stilted and the FBI characters are so grossly unprofessional it counfounds belief. The governor is a stereotypical, racially insensitive, politically incorect, sexually aggressive pig. The confrontations with him quickly devolve into insults that ultimately have no consequence. The silly subplot about freeing the innocent man on death row quickly falls into the realm of the ridiculous.On the plus side, the victims are engaging and the serial killer is fairly well crafted and a refreshing change from the run-of-the-mill slice and dicer. But all in all, Absolute Instinct stinks."
3,Good story but frustrating,"A very good story spoiled by too many historical cases being integrated and too much repetetive description of the characters; for instance, we know that the killer had major issues but we did not need to read about them from different angles throughout the book. During several action areas, the action would begin but then we got a long interlude of the minds of the characters being probed and uninteresting other things, before the action resumed. It became frustrating!However, I liked the general thread of it and took to the heroine, Jessica, and also her English boyfriend on whom Jessica leaned rathere heavily at times. As an Englishman myself, I quite enjoyed his positive role! For an insight into an English attitude, perhaps the author, Robert W. Walker, should read ""Iniquity"" by Bill Franks. (also on Amazon.)"
1,Not for kids.,"Don't buy if the person is over 15. It's not bad but it has non- explisit ""sexual"" content. Also the scenes change very rapidly, it s very hard to follow."
4,Sony Burner,"The burner is working well so far. Can write a 74 minute cd from the hard drive in less than 8-9 minutes. The Sony CD Creator software is not very versatile, I would recommend purchasing another cd software (preferably Adaptec). You need to know how to install a SCSI Adapter Card in to a PCI slot in order to connect the burner. Some knowledge of hardware installation is definitely needed for SCSI products."
5,Get This One!,"I have been required to read 3 books on mentoring for one of my classes and then was required to review and report on another. I examined 5 additional books on mentoring and coaching and this was by far the most complete and readable - in fact, it was the only one that was enjoyable. Mr. Nigro's sense of humor is only outdone by his understanding of how humans operate and his ability to easily explain what so many other authors must fall asleep writing about - how managers can effectively coach and mentor their staff. I highly recommend The Everything Coaching and Mentoring Book."
3,Okay for the price!,"This trimmer is okay for the price. I am happy so far. It comes with a very cheaply made case, but at least it has one."
1,Environmental Nutrition: Understanding the Link Between Foo,The author supports his thesis with weak scientific arguments. I wish I had saved my money and not bought this book.
1,Not what was described,"This product is being returned because one of the movies ""The Year Without a Santa Clause"" was not the movie as described. The movie we were looking for was the cartoon from the 1960's. We received a movie by the same title from 2001 and played by real actors. We were very disappointed. We are returning the whole set and are not happy that the movie was not what we wanted. We will order again from Amazon because the return policy is so wonderful. However this does not help our disappointment.Thank you for your time."
1,BEWARE,"We ordered this set, got it in a timely fashion, opened it and the second DVD was NOT the Rankin-Bass animated special as it is supposed to be (and as is described on the box), but an awful live action film of the same name (""the year without a santa claus"") from 2006 starring John Goodman. I alerted Amazon, and they sent a second set. I opened it today and it has THE SAME PROBLEM. I am sending both back and do not want to go through this again. Someone was asleep at the packaging wheel and who knows how many more box these boxed sets have the same problem. Be warned."
4,"Good titles, but odd mix of just ones that Warner Brothers owns","Like others have stated, we're really being forced to buy an entire collection (many already owned) in order to get a few we can't get on DVD otherwise (The Leprechauns' Christmas Gold, Pinocchio's Christmas, and The Stingiest Man in Town). I knew that going in. Yes, perhaps it is ""bad business practices;"" but since it was only $25, I was okay with that. The logical collection of Christmas movies would include all of the Rankin-Bass ones; but that's NOT what this is. Many of the favorites are not in this collection (e.g., Rudolph, Santa Claus is Coming to Town, and the original Frosty the Snowman are NOT included). Other companies apparently own the rights to those. Nonetheless, as long as you know what you're getting--and I think it is clear from the info and reviews here--it's not a bad buy for $25."
4,Great .................,This product was in great condition and a great buy. Love holiday classics now i can share these with my children in the years to come
2,RIP OFF! NOT THE ORIGINAL VERSION OF A YEAR WITHOUT SANTA!,"This was a huge waste of money! The main reason I bought it was for the ORIGINAL ""A Year Without Santa"", which is what the description read and what appears on the COVER of the DVD, however it came with the John Goodman live action version which was TERRIBLE! Was this a mistake or did everyone who bought this get RIPPED OFF? We had a little viewing party planned with friends coming over, only to open the DVD and be so disappointed! Buy each movie separately if you have any hope of not being disappointed! Going to see if I can send it back and get a refund."
4,There's no one like The KIng(Stephen King),"I was so happy to see this movie for sale on Amazon, and even happier to see that it was available on DVD. Anything from Stephen King is worth watching or reading. I've been taught well by my mother and have enjoyed his work since I was a little kid. This movie is full of suspense and puts the character in situations that we fear most. Still a classic to me!!"
3,Not the best,"This movie was taken from a Stephen King novel. It wasn't the best of his books that went to the screen. Kind of boring, slow and predictable."
5,"""a charming, funny romantic comedy.....""",Funny Funny Funny Funny Funny Funny Funny Funny Funny Funny Funny Funny Funny Funny Funny Funny Funny Funny Funny Funny Funny Funny Funny Funny Funny Funny Funny Funny Funny Funny Funny Funny Funny Funny Funny Funny Funny Funny Funny Funny Funny Funny Funny Funny Funny Funny Funny Funny Funny Funny Funny Funny Funny Funny very Funny Funny Funny Funny Funny Funny Funny Funny very very Funny Funny Funny Funny Funny Funny Funny Funny very Funny Funny Funny Funny Funny Funny Funny Funny very Funny Funny Funny Funny Funny
3,OK,"The transaction was simple, with no snags and delivery was fast. My only problem was that the cartridges are three years old. It worried me a little since these are for safety devices (fill life jackets) but they looked OK so I decided to keep them. In the future I'll be asking how long these items have been on the shelf before I buy."
5,Always great she is....,"Enya never dissapoints, this album is great from top to bottom with at least 4 fantastic songs...absolutely first rate."
2,Same Old Same Old ...,"Dull and uninspired. Everything on this disc seems to be a tired re-hash of the fair-to-middling ""B-side"" tracks from her recent albums. Definitely will listen to the next one BEFORE I buy it."
5,Amazing collector's edition,"Here we have -again- an exquisite product, as all made about Enya, again luxuriously finished, again a detailed item. The red velver case with gold stamped logos and titles is just precious. And the contents, the 148 page book, deliciously written by Roma Ryan is the big surprise of this collector's edition, full of pictures and of course including the CD and the lyrics of each song, both english and in the ""loxian"" language created by Roma where available.For Enya and not Enya fans, just get this one if you want to know more about the creating process of the album Amarantine."
1,Appalled - Very disappointing,"I love Enya with all my heart and was anxiously anticipating this new album. I love how her music is so moving and mood altering.However, this album absolutely stunned me. It does not possess the mood of the other albums, has nothing consequential to say, and sounds more like an album of children's songs with the simple melodies and highly predictable lyrics.There are 2 songs on this entire album that I ""like"" but none i love.I hope future endeavors do not duplicate this horrific collection.I guess I will have to wait another 5 years."
2,very middle of the road:the Sade of New age music,"enya is like the Sade of New age Music in that nobody can lay claim to the way they put stylings down&are able to build catelogs of material.a Proven formula that has worked. Enya's latest Amarantine sounds like leftovers from the past albums that didn't quite make the cut. very average at best.I ain't felt a Enya album in years,but like How Sade is able to maintain what she has done over the past couple of decades Enya has been able to do her thing,but this album shows a artist running short on new ideas but safe on formula."
2,"Ok, if you want some meditation music","I think I've figured out the formula behind Enya's songs. First take out a mad libs, write ""light"", ""love"", ""dark"", ""flower"", ""sea"", and ""stars"" in the blank spots. Add some wispy and haunting ballads, rinse, and repeat.I almost fell asleep listening to this CD."
1,"Utterly unoriginal, utterly un- interesting","I have loved some of Enya's records before, as have most people. That is why this album is so disappointing. It is a complete rip-off. There is not an original sound or thought on it! I really wish I could get my money back. And the company that handles her should be just as ashamed for milking the cow she has apparently become. Don't waste your money...."
1,"Love Enya, but not this one","I truely adore Enya's music. I have almost everything she has done and listen to them repeatedly. In fact, she is my favorite choice to listen to in the dentist's chair while undergoing nitrous oxide! However, this one left me cold (with the exception of track #7, which is very pretty). The songs and music on this album lack the grace, lyrical qualities, enchantment, and ability to carry me away that the rest of her music manages effortlessly to do. One of Enyas most ardent fans, I'm sorry to say, was let down big by this one."
5,Wonderful cd,"I like this cd!! Its very good when you want to go to sleep or relax...""Amerantine"" is very beautiful song and ""its in the rain"" are my two favorite! I also like how the scotish chour sang in the cd...The right kind of theme of enya...for all you new age lovers get this cd!"
3,Fast start fast end,"This movie starts fast then goes on as emotional people make bad decisions then ends quickly, good twist at end"
5,Great!,This book is all an elementary teacher would ever need. Pictures and topics are clear and great ideas that my students LOVE!
5,This tape is a necessity in cardmaking,"This adhesive tape works soooo well. Much more economical to use this tape with a tape gun than to keep buying the little dotty tape dispensers. The tape gun is worth the investment, if you are really into card making and other paper crafting."
2,"Overpriced, overcomplicated, but necessary","Canon, I'm appalled: instead of simply packing the adequate number of steel plates with the various underwater housings, you're selling these things for, I'm sure, 10 or 20 times the manufacturing price, AND complicate matters with the multiple screw/weight combination."
4,Great if you like erotic fantasy type movies.,"I saw this movie 10 years ago on a pay-type cable channel and it had very good erotic overtones to the theme. If you're into that sort of movie and maybe a threesome thing, you should LOVE this one. I've been looking for it for a VERY long time to buy and finally saw that the International Movie Database (www.imdb.com) has data on it and I bought it immediately on Amazon. I can't wait to watch it again after all those years... It has a very good adult fantasy theme that could be enjoyed with your spouse or as a couple."
2,I am very disappointed!,"The only part of this one-hour video that was useful to me was a short training session (about 15 minutes) showing how to teach a dog to sit, lie down, stay, etc. using hand signals and treats. If it were not for this part of the video, I would have gotten my money back."
2,Disappointing,"This book reads like an encyclopedia or a bibliography. Every other sentence has a quote from some other source. You don't really get to hear Kahane's voice. I was expecting to hear his philosophy, but instead I got jewish philosophy from others. This book might be good for people who don't know much about judaism, but if you're looking for Kahane, you won't find him here. You could easily take Kahane's name off the cover, and just look at the table of contents, and then just open to the chapter that interests you and read what other jewish sources had to say about things like humility, love for God, and love for fellow jews. I still want to check out the second volume, because it looks more interesting than the first."
1,Stop. Do not pass go. Do not spend $90.,"I've posted this review on several differently colored panini presses...though mine is red. I'm THAT passionate about the low quality of this product. It angers me every time I see it in my closet (won't fit in my cabinets). This press:1.) Doesn't heat both sides equally2.) Adheres to bread and fish like white on rice...even with oil/butter/nonstick spray3.) has a cool colored finish that will chip and look hideous in no time.Seriously, take my word, this is an utter disaster of a product. Either reevaluate whether you need a press, or try another line. If I could turn back time, I'd try Lodge (and they have new colors now to), All Clad, or one of the cheaper cheap pans. This is about the quality of one of those ones priced at $30 or $40. If you're going to lay out $90, go the extra mile and buy something made with quality in mind such as Le Creuset or All Clad or Lodge!"
2,Thin,"Let's start with the positives:- the book is easy to read and reasonably well written;- the basic facts of the story are covered;- the book starts the story way back before the problems emerged so that you get a feel for what the business was up to.But- it is very short book for such a complex subject- the ""unravelling"" - the investigations into ""what went wrong"" are (ironically) not well covered- there is almost no coverage of the Andersen issuesSo save your dollar, pound, euro or yen - don't waste it on this book."
2,Doesn't Add Much,"Having read many newspaper and magazine accounts of the fall of Enron, including excellent coverage in The New York Times and BusinessWeek, this book really doesn't add much. It's a concise retelling of the events, so that's nice. But it imparts no greater understanding or context. Among the problems: The writing is bland. The book gives almost no explanation for Enron's rise before the calamitous fall. It never makes clear exactly why Enron had to go bankrupt. This account spends hardly any time on Arthur Andersen's role, even thought it led to that accounting firm's ruin. The authors also have an odd obsession with Michael Milken, even though he seems peripheral to the Enron story. If you've missed the news in the past seven months, this book can quickly give you the outline of the Enron saga. Otherwise, save your money."
2,what went wrong... with this book,"""What Went Wrong With Enron' desrves some credit for trying to quickly explain the collapse of the company just six months after it declared bankruptcy. But the book does a poor job of explaining how Enron grew to be the world's biggest energy trader, also lacks in color on the main personalities such as Ken Lay and Andrew Fastow and on the corporate culture that allowed for accounting fraud."
3,"Okay, but not as good as expected","This book is okay and certainly worth reading, but not as good as I expected after seeing all those ""5-star ratings"". Some of the key issues are not covered in enough detail, according to my opinion. The book tells the story of Enron, but should give more concrete examples which explain in detail what went wrong. It all remains rather vague. Also, I would've loved to read an interview with some of Enron's customers for example. Or some of their (former) employees."
4,An amusing morality tale of business and a teaching tool.,"Looking for a teaching tool for undergraduates who would not have cultural contacts with the corporate environment, this film has been a useful introduction to the current corporate crazes. As Tom Wolfe depicted the markets in ""Barnfire of the Vanities"", this little comedy has a useful correlate in alerting us to some of the paradoxes of the business world. It is not always true that the capitalist using the 'bottom-line mentality' is the enemy of anyone but those who misuse the power and authority of managing a business. As ""Wallstreet"" depicts aspects of ""insider-trading"", OPM weaves its own morality play about the nature of ""nice"" when the issue is ""performing"" when you have borrowed other people's money. It is a good screenplay, a tight drama, and a useful experience for a college level audience. END"
4,great movie,"Great movie and handled well with equal arguments and funy. But had to pay thirdy dolllars for it, mainly because I should have search elsewhere,"
4,Entertaining and even educational,"In general, I like most Danny DeVito films. He is a comic genius, but also manages to slip in some telling social commentary. This film is no exception. It has great one-liners, mixed with enough sound economics that Instructors at the college where I teach have students watch the film in business classes. You will be entertained and even learn something. What more could you ask?"
3,WARNING SPOILERS!!!!,"there is one thing a mystery has to have to be good. a plot twist. this book doesnt have it. the person you think it is from page1 ends up doing it. how boring. i mean it has a preaty good story line and likeable characters(except for his dad, but youre supposed to hate him) but the last 20 pages ruined it for me."
1,Klute Sountrack from Harkit Real or legalized Bootleg?,"Well This release has been sought after and we are given a spruced up LP dub onto a CD format. Most of it sounds fine, but the paper quality of the booklet with typos throughout What is it with bootlegs do they not have someone smart enough to edit these notes? THe printed CD quality image is horrible as well as the back cover - Really tacky. I think the Score is awesome but this really is a poor delivery on Harkit Records behalf. You'd expect more form a company in Englaqnd most known for LP rips onto CDs selling them as if they are the best CDs ever. There should be laws against selling an CD release like this so poorly executed.If I have typos in my review please forgive me no one from Harkit Records was able to go voer these notes.JackDVD78@aol.com"
1,Netgear FVL328 router,Very poor experience. The router worked well until the 30 day return period was over. I have been using three of them and they crash virtually every day. Don't even consider using it anywhere where reliability is critical.
1,...,"15 users, this unit continously crashes and very poor performance. I'm returning this unit as its not performing as advertised."
2,Consider Carefully,"""High Speed""? Don't think so. These units are easy to set up and install, and are feature-rich. They might work fine if you only have a few users (like under 10), but I experienced serious performance issues with only 25 users connected. They slow down seriously when you run a decent amount of traffic through them."
5,Wonderful heartful movie,Excellent cast and well done remake of a terrific play.Nathan Lane's spot appearance is terrific. It is not your typical feel-good movie but the effect is the same. Enjoy.
1,DVD will not play in American DVD player,"The movie is fantastic but the DVD itself is foreign and therefore will not play in either of my standard DVD players or in a PS3. It plays only on my ibook G4, which is beyond irritating. I will never buy from this seller again and I would not recommend using them, as I had no notice that the DVD was foreign and would be hard to watch."
1,Not a U.S. compatible DVD/Wrong Continent!,I received the Frankie and Johnny DVD. It is not compatible with any of my three (3) DVD players/blu-ray players. Looks like a European version --- distributed by Paramount U.K.Return policy is a joke --- what a rip-off.
3,Star power kept this from being a two star movie,"This movie is very uneven, with Pfeiffer's character alternating between a stereotyped New York tough and one's high school sweetheart. Pacino is good, but unconvincing; who would take the constant rebuffs meted out by Pfeiffer? The movie lacks depth, and is generally boring. It has some moments, but overall, not very good."
5,Not Perfect,"Frankie and Johnny is not your average romantic comedy. Al Pacino plays a short-order cook who attempts to win the heart of a woman (Michelle Pfeiffer) who desperately wants to remain distant after a troubled past. Unlike many romantic comedies of this nature, Frankie and Johnny strays away from the formulaic guy meets girl, guy wins girl, guy screws up, and guy wins girl again. Instead, Pacino's character spends the entire movie trying to knock down the walls that Pfeiffer's charcter has built around herself. When he finally does, the movie ends with a final scene that leaves us wondering about their future. This movie ranks ahead of all other trite romantic comedies because of a superb supporting cast and the fresh chemistry that Pacino and Pfeiffer bring to the screen."
2,ONE OF JOHN WAYNE'S MANY B WESTERNS,"A TOWN ON THE BRINK OF STARVATION IS SAVED WHEN A MYSTERIOUS STRANGER [JOHN WAYNE] COMES ALONG AND DISCOVERS THAT THERE'S GOLD THAT SOME CRIMINALS DON'T WANT THE TOWN TO FIND OUT ABOUT. PREDICTABLE AND NOT ENOUGH ACTION. IF THE FILM HAD A LITTLE MORE ACTION TO IT, THIS ONE COULD'VE BEEN ALRIGHT. RECCOMENDED ONLY FOR DIE-HARD FANS OF JOHN WAYNE."
4,Cool Idea,"Me and my son played this game back in the 80's and now again with the new version. We have always found it a hoot. We don't always agree with some answers, but they sure can result in some arguments! Quality was much better than previous version. We realize for a game, it's been a good item and good family fun."
1,confusing,Sales list indicates Alternate Channel capabilities. This is not listed in technical data. Does it or does it not have alternate channel selector ?
2,A mixed review,"I bought one of these in Feb. '08, still have it, it works and I like how it performs. But I must note it gets very little use. However with that in mind I bought a 2nd for our childrens' religious school in Nov. '09. I recently learned that it's not worked since some time during the last school year and it's a small school <15 students and they only meet once a week. Therefore I'd warn you off buying this. It shouldn't die when it's not even two yrs. old and has only been used 1x/wk. during the school yr. by <15 students in an 1 1/2 hr. class!"
5,just what we needed,Bought this as a gift for my son's 3rd grade teacher. She loves it! Does a great job sharpening the pencils!
2,"Poor quality, but at least they are sending a replacement free of charge","Worked great for 1 day, but that was it. Unfortunately, I threw out all of the packaging after I saw it worked so did not have the packaging to return to Amazon. Fortunately, Amazon still allowed me to return using the packaging from the replacement product that they sent via next day air. Good customer service, bad product, but I guess all manufacturers may make a dud now and then. We'll see how the second one works. Would have been 1 star but for good customer service on the return."
2,Poor Design,X-Acto did a very bad job in designing this product. If the plastic stem on the shavings catcher breaks off (it does very easily when removed) the sharpener won't function. This sharpener had to be replaced after about three months of use. Get the Panasonic KP-150. It's a much better investment.
2,Disappointing!,"Before purchasing the X-Acto Electric Pencil Sharpener, I paid half the price for an electric sharpener from Wal-Mart that lasted over five years. This product has lasted a mere five months. Rarely used, it often sticks, overheats after only a few uses, and then ceases to work at all.I had hoped a sharpener of better quality would last longer, especially considering it isn't even used very often. It would seem I was mistaken."
5,Great!,Arrived on time...works like a charm! no more cheap plastic litle sharperner for my kids. This one does the job well.
5,Fantastic,this sharpener is smooth and reliable. does not bind up or break the tips of the pincils. i have one on my desk at work and one at home. this is a fantastic shapener.
3,Horsepower but not perfect,"My experience also found off-center sharpening to be an issue. Even wiggling the pencil around while sharpening doesn't solve the problem. The motor sure sounds like an industrial product. The rectangular flat shape is convenient on a desk, fits well amongst books."
4,"Eric Red meets Jeff Fahey . ""I like it a lot"" ..","I've always wished Jeff Fahey had made more horror films than he had . Turns in THE LAWNMOWER MAN (Director's cut) , PSYCHO III , WYATT EARP (among others) had left me informed that Jeff was super good at coming unhinged . I was SO thrilled to see him turn up in GRINDHOUSE many years removed from those early projects . One of my very favorite modern horror pictures remains Eric Red's THE HITCHER . This really is a perfect union . These two guys know the genre well . With a great supporting cast and a solid core idea , you're gonna dig this one . If a true horror fan you are ? English subtitles and in widescreen for optimal enjoyment ."
5,"""Montreux One"" is the name of the album being discussed","I'm not familiar with ""Witches & Devils"", but I believe these reviews all refer to Shepp's ""Montreux One"" CD (there is also a ""Montreux Two"" CD);a live concert recorded by his group in the mid-seventies.Shepp plays well throughout, but his performance on ""Lush Life"" is ... every adjective I come up with is inadequate.If you have a short jazz shelf, think about adding this to it. If you have a vault full of jazz cds, you should have this one already."
1,wha happen'?!,"What on earth has happened to this band? I was such a fan untilI was able to really listen to this, which only made it more difficult to write this. Karma in contrast, was such a heart feltwork of art, but this album seemed to be driven by something elselike record execs or some outside force. songs seemed to only climb half way up before they got annoying. Hopefully the canstep back down and try again!"
4,Epica Indeed...,"The title of this album pretty much sums it up. This is an engaging, exhilerating album full of progressive, melodic and power metal.This is a hard album to place in any genre, but i would describe it as Melodic Metal, with strong elements of Power Metal. Fans of Power Metal, eg. Dio, will surely love this, and fans of more alternative Metal will find something to enjoy too.Songs like Center Of The Universe, Descent Of The Arkangel and A Feast For The Vain are epic and powerful songs with strong, driving guitar and good vocals, wheras Farewell and On The Coldest Winter Night are ballads, with sorrowful vocals and meandering music.This is a fun, exciting album that is a great listen."
4,Not perfect but still excellent,"This album seems to be almost universally loved by fans of this type of music and I must say that I like it more and more with each listen. As with Karma, I think Kamelot's (only) problem is that they haven't really got any SUPERB songs...none of their songs suck, many are really good (a Feast for the Vain, excellent), but....still, the final strokes of genius are missing, so to say. BUT: That being said, Kamelot is an outstanding band with super technical skill, imaginative lyrics (even more so when you compare them with the lyrics of Stratovarius, for example), really good overall sound (each instrument sounds like it should, no Iron Maiden-drumsound here)....I recommend this album to all lovers of melodic, bombastic, heavy metal:). And like I said, I think this album in particular is one you will like more and more with time, the first listenings maybe won't do the trick (happened to me)."
3,Just ok,"The bars could use a few more, yet smaller LED's for a more uniformed color. While adding an interesting look, most 50"" style TV's will probably need more than 2 bars for the right ""look"", additionally the connectors are somewhat flimsy. Out of the box my connection to the power adapter is loose and the slightest vibration will cause it to lose power."
2,BAD DVD TREATMENTS FOR GOOD FILMS SUCK,"I skipped I ROBOT in the theaters but I had a feeling it would be good enough to buy on dvd and worth the short wait. Well I waited for nothing because there are very little special features and i have enough bare bones dvd's such as the paramount made friday the 13th films. I decided to just download I robot off of bit torrent and found it to be a good movie that deserved the two disk package like spiderman 2 and collateral got. Being a huge will smith fan, i feel really let down that the film company schemes to release multiple editions of the dvd. stop being greedy!"
3,Science Fiction,"The year is 2035. Detective Del Spooner is investigating the death of an eccentric scientist named Dr. Alfred Lanning. Spooner is aided by psychologist Dr. Susan Calvin. Dr. Lanning's death is initially labeled a suicide. Spooner, however, suspects that a robot may be responsible for the death of the good doctor. This seems unthinkable since robots are governed by ""The Three Laws of Robotics"": a robot may never harm or allow harm to come to a human being. As Spooner and Calvin investigate the death, they come to believe that a robot did commit the crime. They are aided in their investigation by Dr. Lanning himself, who appears as a hologram, and reveals that he was working on a top secret project at the time of his death."
1,Poor 3D,"I had the original I robot and bought the new 3d version with some great expectation. The 3d is very poor, cannot tell the diff between it and the 2d version. Poor."
3,Great effects..over and over,"Yup, that's it..great couple of effects...used entirely too much. A good watch the first time....but not something to watch over and over."
2,"I, do not recommend.","I wanted to see this for a while and I thought it was a letdown. It held my interest for only a few seconds (which I think it's obvious which scene that was, I wasn't expecting that) There are special effects, but those could be created with a computer for any movie at any time. I like Will Smith, but this just doesn't do it for me. If sci-fi is what you crave, I would say look elsewhere. I've seen the comparisons to Blade Runner, which don't hold up to me because at least I can say I enjoyed that movie."
2,"I, Robot and Independance Day Too Much$$$$$","Independance Day and I, Robot are awesome movies. I bet they look great on Blu-Ray, but was does Fox price them so high. $28 for an old movie is crazy. I Am Legend is only $19 which I will be buying, but I will wait on these two movies until the price goes down."
2,"I, Boring","I've seen this movie three times, and still can't force myself to like it. Frankly, it's boring. Will Smith looks bored, so does Bridget Moynahan (Sylvia Calvin) and Chi McBride. The ""funny"" one-liners are boring, too. The only person smiling in this production seems to be the robot, Sonny. And he's mostly animated! The movie is saved to some extent by the dramatic finale, when the robots come alive and try to take over the world (what else?). But not by much. Even during the finale, Smith and Moynahan look bored and boring! ""I, Robot"" ends with a cliff-hanger, implying that another revolution is in the air, this time led by the nice guy Sonny. But since there's no sequel, we're ultimately left with nothing at all...Two stars."
3,An interesting premise,"This movie was unique and entertaining. I know the concept of A.I. is not new, but I like how it was realised in this film. This is by no means a great movie or a real important one, but it was fairly enjoyable and basically what you would call a 'popcorn flick', though a decent one. Will Smith plays the same exact character in every movie so I can't really rate him on his acting skills in this film, but it was at least bearable. The robots in the film were pretty neat, as were the rest of the effects. So, while not completely innovative, it is definitetly watchable."
5,""" I Robot """,I Robot. I have always liked this movie (Will Smith stars in it) I would recommend it to everybody and everybody. When I ordered it I was happy that it arrived within the time I was told I would receive it
2,"not that bad , but not even close to the book","The film is not actually that bad , but instead of been call I Robot it should be call hardwire (scrpt's original name).For anyone that wants to see an Hollywod action movie itsok but if you want to see a film based on Asimov book ,don't see it because it's totally based on other story not even closed onwhat asimov wanted to tell about it in his books."
3,"Why Didn't Anyone Do ""The Robot"" In This Movie?","Personally, I love breakdancing.This movie has ruined my love for this great contact sport.I could eat a ballerina with a spoon and nothing else.Where's my go go gadget spatula?"
2,"I, Robot","Very good movie, but the language was awful. Why do they have to ruin good movies with foul language and taking God's name in vain. We've always liked Will Smith. To bad they ruined the movie."
1,Not Pleased....,I have never received this movie. I have written the seller twice and still have heard nothing. Please let me know what is going on with this order. Rebecca Nix
4,Asminov's book comes alive,Wil Smith is Det. Spooner investigating an unusual murder mystery. Who did it? Man or robot? Who or what did it and why? Great special effects & witty dialogue.
5,testin,"love it, i would have not known it was 2nd hand, great!!!!!!!everything about it was great,digital copy and all wonderful, it plays good,sounds good, picture perfect"
2,Review is specific for this combo pack more than the movie,"I ordered the 3D/Bluray combo pack for the action/graphics. It's a typical Will Smith big budget action movie (so if you like those you'll like this).I don't post many reviews but I wanted to on this 3D/Bluray pack because the 3D disc does not play on my Vizio 3D Bluray player. The disc acts like it is going to load, and then just ejects. I ordered it a second time thinking that I had received a defective disc the first time. I was wrong. The second one did the exact same thing.Save your time and money and order a normal DVD."
2,"I, Will Smith","Nice Transfer, nice Audio, nice F/X, bad Script. A missed chance. Yes Will, you have been working out. With all that product placement I wonder if somebody put any money. No, it is far from Asimov. The good robot movie is still to be done. Spielberg's AI was a better try. The Day The Earth Stood Still has still the best robot so far (1951). It must not be easy."
5,philips wonderful,"i've also owned an rca tv, this time i wanted to try a philips, boy i'm so glad i did, it's wonderful, very easy to program, the sleeptimer i think is great, now i'm looking for 27-inch for the family room. philips here we go again."
2,Deep in the Shade of Paradise,It was a very convivuled book and difficult to get into. The people's names were difficult to keep track of and the wanderings of the author were distracting.
1,Don't Purchase,"These DVDs are absolutely rip offs. M-1 had some great fights, however you only see the action that was on broadcast TV. Each of these only come with 5 fights and many cut out rounds 1 and 2. The DVD's only hold about 50 minutes of action. I am a big time MMA Fan and these DVDs are just not worth it. HDNET should have bundled the fights together and made compilation DVDs"
3,"Nice read, but the movie was more magical","If you liked the movie and then decided to check out the book like me, you were probably, dissapointed. This isn't that good of a book. And it is depressing in some parts, especially the parts about Antonia and Kylie. I did like the parts with the Aunts and I wish they had been in there more. The movie was beautiful and magical, and the book was pretty much ho hum. Don't buy it if you are searching for the prettiness of the movie."
2,Mildly disappointed,"I didn't enjoy this book as much as I did the movie, usually the book are much better but I was surprisingly disappointed."
3,The Movie Is Better...But the book is Okay.,I chose to give it only three stars because its just okay compared to the movie. The book just doesnt have the same wow factor. It was a quick and easy read though Ill give it that! :)
5,Great story,"Simple, funny, all together great read if you have spare time. If you're a fan of Alice Hoffman you won't be disappointed with this novel."
2,Really didn't like this,"Anyone that loved the movie, will not like this book. I have seen the movie more times than I can count, so I was excited to get this book. I was very disappointed. The aunts really do not have a place except here and there. The closeness of all the women was just lacking to me. One of my favorite parts of the movie is what led up to Jimmy's death and the solution. So not in the book. The magic is just lacking. Sorry."
2,"The movie was better, and the movie didn't thrill me.","You've read the summary, so I'll just cut to the chase. First of all, loved, loved, loved Hoffman's 'voice' and use of language: Gillian's passion for her new biology teacher lover melts all the butter in the house, a woman pounds on her lover's door until she literally breaks her hand -- Hoffman is very good at powerful, evocative images, at gliding on the surface and gazing at the tempestuous emotions below her.However, everything else about this novel began to irritate me before long. Hoffman was obsessed with pairing everyone up, down to the last obnoxious teenager, and the only romance that held any appeal for me was the one between Gillian and Ben. Gary (Sally's love interest) was boring and entered the story much too late for me. (He doesn't seem to be a very good investigator, either.) Also, the swearing seemed unnecessary, as if it came out of a different book. I might try Hoffman again, but I won't be re-reading this one."
3,Reads a little bit like a woman's romance novel,"I am a man who reads a wide variety of literature. I like Jane Austin and Dickens... loved Jane Eyre. Also love fantasy, Harry Potter, young adult adventures involving magic... I thought this might be a good match for my interests. It read fine- I can't say that I didn't enjoy it at all- I would just say that it was a little too much of a woman's book for me. The magic aspects are merely the gimmick to get you interested- the bulk of the book is about the romantic attachments of the four women involved in the story. Lots of female angst and self doubt, and lusting after the various flavors of studs in the story. If you are a woman, you might love it- if you are a man, it might test your empathy skills. It bears some resemblance to the movie but does not match it closely."
4,"Fast, easy reading",I read this book long before the movie was even in production. I enjoyed the book very much. It was very easy and fast to read.
2,"Sorry Alice,.....","The movie is better than the book. The character of Sally Owens is just too drab and dry in the book. Also, the aunts are barely characters."
1,Disappointing characters,"I resented rewatched this movie and noticed it was based on a book so i eagerly got it for my kindle. I'm about a quarter of the way through and I'm not sure I'm going to bother to finish reading it. I'm finding the writing style a bit slow and where the movie was charming and characters were lovable, even with their flaws I'm not finding myself unsympathetic to any of the characters in the book. I'm not compelled to learn what happens to any of them because i just don't care about them. Each character is described as being totally selfish in their own way so i haven't bonded with any of the characters enough to want to read about them."
3,Prettier in picture.,In person this ring is pretty plain. There are no grooved areas on the sides as it looked to me. But the ring is cheap and I guess you get what ya pay for it. Don't get me wrong it is made well but just not what I thought it would be.
5,Excellent Guide,"I visited Buenos Aires in May 1999. I found Bernhardson's review to be almost perfect in pointing out places to eat, sightsee, shop, and how to get there (or rather, how to obtain information on how to get there from the locals). Even his club recommendations were perfect for me - I was 19, and his description of one club's crowd as ""young and unpretentious"" proved to be true and exactly what I was looking for. Buenos Aires is a wonderful place to visit, and Bernhardson's guide is a must-have for any visitor."
2,why,"Wilton instructor showed me how to affix bag tie. I'm not sure it really helped, and the BEST advice I can give to anyone who decorates cakes with shortening based icing is to make ""cartridges"" of icing wrapped in plastic wrap which are inserted into the decorating bag. See Wilton discussion boards. BEST HINT EVER thought I doubt Wilton likes it, as it would put a crimp in sales of decorator bags."
1,Don't buy this,"I thought I was getting a good deal on this sending unit, as the one at the Honda dealer was about double this price. This unit did not work at all. I was able to go to my local discount auto parts store and buy one that worked for the same price. Sending the unit back for refund doesn't make much sense"
3,"Does the job, but wouldn't buy again","It's not a bad vac, and it does the job. Power is sufficient for light duty. Using it is a bit inconvenient: flips to easily, not enough attachments. The bags are very small, need to be replaced after each cleaning. Not suitable for carpet cleaning. I keep it and use it, but when it breaks, I'll buy another model."
3,Great Movies Awful Quality,"I was very excited to see all three of these movies on one disc. For the record, this review is more about the quality versus the actual films. These movies are WONDERFUL and I would suggest anyone see all of them. Yes, they are that good! (Especially His Girl Friday) However, the quality of this disc is just plain horrible. And like one reviewer, I, at first, attributed it to the age of the films. But when I saw two of these films on Turner Classic Movies, they were just fine! So I thought the DVD should have been just as good. In His Girl Friday, the sound was so blurred, I could barely understand what was going on! The actual picture quality was bad, as well. The screen continued to jump and was just as blurry and grainy as the sound. Charade was no better. I'd suggest you wait or look around for a better version of these films. Either way, you should definitely see them!"
2,Not good for a betta,"I purchased this because we have a betta and silk plants are recommended so as to not tear their fins. I was disappointed at the quality of this plant. The plant we received has plastic burs and is missing some leaves. Only the leaves are ""silk;"" the stem is hard plastic. I also couldn't find anything on the package that actually said the plant is ""silk."" The leaves are not super soft. The one I received doesn't look as ""full"" as the one pictured. I won't be returning this because it's not worth the hassle but I will not be putting it in our betta's tank."
1,Awful,"This movie is just plain awful.It doesn't make any sense and it is so boring.It can't get much worse than this movie.On a scale of 1-10,I would give a 2.I would have given it a 1 but since David Arquette is in it,I'll give it one extra point."
4,Quiet and a bit underpowered,"I looked it several different pumps to power my aquaponics system. This unit was recommended by the guys at Friendly Aquaponics so I thought I couldn't go wrong. I have about 400 gallons in my system and the goal is to cycle at least that amount every hour. By the specs this pump should be more that enough to handle the job, but it seems a little underpowered to me and next time I think I will go with a larger Danner pump as the pump seems to be very well made. This is not like the cheap Chinese pumps you get off Ebay.It came with a basket that keeps a lot of the solid material out of the pump, but at the same time it doesn't have any problem pumping the fish waste or algae buildup. I have been running it for 2 and a half months and have not had to clean it out once. It has a standard 3/4 in pvc outlet so I was able to use pvc piping bought at the big box store."
4,pondmaster pump,Good durable pump. Works well if you have a sufficiently large filter so that you dont have to clean the filter frequently.
3,eap,"edgar allen poe for free. this gives this book at least 3 stars. too bad it's in volumes, or else this would be a 5 star rating."
2,I wouldn't bother,"While I found the idea of the book interesting, the execution was boring in the extreme. I'd be reading along and then find myself thinking about something else altogether (like, say housework). I think if the author had stuck to fewer, better developed characters, it would have been much more satisfying. As it is, it reads more like an outline than a book."
4,Small step down from Rated and Songs,"Not as good as Rated R or Songs For The Deaf but that is to be expected when you consider how good they are. Has its moments but just doesn't quite put it all together as the aforementioned. I know some will attribute the drop to the lineup change but I suspect it came down to very common problem with bands after a monster release, being rushed by the studio to capitalize on the increase in popularity. I think some of the songs would not have made the cut or would have been improved with more time. My recommendation is to download your favorites."
5,Killer new album,"Don't believe all the hype that the Queens suck now because Nick Oliveri was fired from the band and now this album will be awful. While it is different than it's predecessors, heading even further in the direction of Songs For the Deaf as far as conception and overall sound, this album ROCKS. Just listen to songs like Little Sister, Medication, Tangled Up in Plaid, and the long space-outs Someone's In the Wolf and The Blood Is Love. Heady (and heavy) stuff!"
4,Desert Sessions: Volume 9 1/5,"First off, this is Queens of the Stone Age's FOURTH album, not third. People must be forgetting the ass kicking, booty shaking self-titled debut. But on to the review. The easiest way to sum this album up is Desert Sessions 9 1/2. A very good album and I personally believe very influenced by Josh's sessions (In My Head was actually taken from Vol. 9 & 10). The album doesn't rock as hard as Songs did, but, what rocking out it doesnt have, it makes up in with smooth, catchy, eerie, riffs and vocals that will make you want to listen to the album over and over again. You can definitly see the difference in drummers (Dave Grohl was loud and random while Joey is softer and more punctual). Definitly not Songs for the Deaf but definitly an album worth checking out. Constant reinvention, you have to love it."
3,major disappointment after Songs for the Deaf,"I honestly feel this is a two star album, but that is only because Songs for the Deaf was such a masterpiece. Post-Oliveri or not, there is still something major lacking in this record. It feels like it never really gets moving. Little Sister is very good, but the rest of the songs are pretty monotonous. Where the hell is Mark Lanagan?? Featured only on one song? He's a major reason why previous Queens records have been good. I do give this 3 stars - because Songs for the Deaf was SO good, with so much added talent (Dave Grohl was fantastic) that it would not be fair to base a comparison on SftD."
3,Review mistake,"In the Amazon.com editorial review, Mr. Aidin Vaziri wrote,""the restless front man keeps things dependably loud and sludgy on the group's third album"". I'd just like to let him know it is their fourth album. The first album was self-titled, then ""R"" or Restricted, Songs For the Deaf, and Lullabies to Paralyze. Just thought I'd set things straight."
1,Don't bother with this one,"A jumble of references to a jumble of studies aimed at convincing you that we'd all be better off with a sales tax of up to 70%, with 36 pages of footnotes. The book progressivly steps you through the arguments, starting with1. Something is terribly wrong with the way we're living today2. It's because we're making poor decisions on what we spend money on3. We'd all be happier if we paid a lot more taxes.No joke!He makes passing references to the failure of centrally planned economies, but doesn't appear to have drawn any real lessons from them. I get the impression that he mentions these failures so that nobody can accuse him of having ignored them.All in all, I'm happy I checked this out from the library instead of buying it."
2,Excuse me??!,"Excuse me, Alexandrea Marie Anna Bunitorsua, are you STUPID(I think you are) you want to have children at 15 yrs old? what are you, a rebel? Oh, and girls CAN participate in sports. You're lust chicken to try it out. Ohh. talk like that again. girls can participate in school. your just dumb enough to know that!- Rovi, a BRATZ collecter"
1,Two thumbs down,"I picked up this book while vacationing in the southwest. The subject sounded interesting. If only the story had been written by a ghost writer it may have been worth the time taken to read it. Blessings is a juvenile rendering of a love story. It's written on the level of teenage romance novels, but I doubt if any teenagers would find it any more engaging than I did. This is a story of an educated, older man approached by a young Navajo woman with aspirations of attending college. Unfortunately, from the moment they met, all of her goals for higher education were completely ignored all to pander to her husband's ego. Don't waste your time. The other reviews must have been written by friends."
1,SO DISAPOINTED,"i did not pay head to the other reveiws, and bought this bike anyway. the first day i had it, the back fender snapped off, leaving sharp points exposed. sadly, we had to tell our 4 year old, on his birthday, that he could not ride the bike. so we returned it and got another one. not more than 30 mins after getting on the new one, than the ""exhaust pipes"" came off, leaving a VERY sharp screw exposed, then the tire came off and the rim broke, becuase it was plastic as well. also, the vinyl on the seat started to come apart.at this point, i had to return it, and fight to get my money back!! it was a week after it had been delivered to the house. i was to afraid that my kids would get hurt on this peice of junk.please do not endanger your children by purchasing this bike!!"
5,A solid toy that looks great,"This Tricycle has an original design,it seems that is going to last because of its construction and it catches everyones atention"
2,Unworthy of Thirkell,I love the Thirkell books but this one is an aberration. It's trite and obvious. The characters are not particularly interesting. It's as if the author decided to try something different -- and it didn't work. Skip this one and read her other works.
3,Beware - small notes,"The good thing about this book is that the content is really good, especially for this list price. If you're in intermediate level, the selection is decent. You really do get a lot for your money.The bad thing I wish I had known before I bought the book is that the font is really really small. I didn't know the music books could be published this small. The usual dimension for piano music books are 9.2 inches by 11.8 inches or so. This book is 8 by 11, like the typical xerox paper. It hurts my eyes to look at it."
5,A. Murray is always worth reading!,"Over the years Andrew Murray's books have always been both instructional and inspirational. This one is no exception. If someone in your life is in need of healing, please give this book to them or read it to them."
4,Stant 10506 Locking Fuel Cap,"Fits a 2000 Blazer. I needed a replacement cap after the check engine light came on again after being robbed, erm, getting gas. The caps the smog check people keep selling me after failing me for cracked seals in the cap just don't seem to hold up. How odd.The key and locking mechanism are a little annoying to use. They're like oil and vinegar. But once you're done struggling to unlock it, you can remove the key as the cap self-locks once you click it into place. I've had it for about two months and all seems well. I'm going to buy another just in case they tell me this one is cracked too."
5,Best of Film Noire,This is one of the very best of the genre. Right up there with the Maltese Falcon.
4,Be Sure to Get the DVD by Image,"I'm a fan of this movie even though the plot is a little silly at times, and Cornell Wilde isn't the greatest of actors. However the film makes up for it's weaknesses in style. The cinematography and stark lighting are first rate. Plus it has Richard Conte, who is one of my favorite actors.The Big Combo is in the public domain, and there are several versions available on DVD, so buyer beware. I recommend the one by Image Entertainment. Although the print used in their version has scratches in several scenes, it still has the best picture quality of all the PD DVDs out there. (Avoid the ones by Geneon Entertainment and Alpha Video. The Geneon version is interlaced, too.) Even so, the Image disc is a bare bones affair, with no extras. Maybe one day someone will do a proper restoration of the film and include an audio commentary by a film historian, but until then the Image DVD will have to do."
5,His best album so far,"I loved ""Rose Kennedy,"" his first album, and liked his second one ""Negatif,"" but not as much. This one, however, from track one blew me away. This album is lush, theatrical and epic, with amazing instruments and Biolay's vocals finally rising above a hush. One of the best of 2005, no doubt."
2,toy is smaller than dimensions indicate,"While I'm sure the product itself is fine, the dimensions are inaccurate. The toy is at best 4"" long, not 5' and when you have slightly larger dogs than can destroy a smaller toy, that inch matters. Hopefully it will last longer than a week."
2,Just a journal,"This is just a blank journal -- so not much to it. However, it is a great way to make yourself pay attention to what is good in your life. A friend recommended each night before you go to bed, to list 5 things that you were grateful for that day -- and try not to repeat. It is harder than you think, but very rewarding."
1,Absolutely blah!,"I don't know what I was expecting when I purchased this book! It is a journal, but the spaces allotted for each day are quite small. Perhaps the author didn't anticipate that some people have large handwriting or that others would have a lot to say. I never used it, and would not recommend it. Buy a journal with larger spaces!"
3,"A NICE JOURNAL , BUT NOT MUCH WRITING SPACE.","If the intent of this journal was to record our blessings each day, then one would need to do some brief hand-scratching to record them in the extremely limited space provided. Perhaps it is based on my beliefs in Buddhist Philosophies, but I very much like the idea of giving thanks for five blessings we have received each day. Quite often though, I find myself often giving thanks for the same things over and over again: the love of my husband, good health, the beauty of nature, the joy of humanity and the peaceful nation in which I live. These precious gifts could be broken down further but the scanty amount of space does not leave much room for any lengthy thoughts. One really does have to do an abbreviated version, and that is the one major downfall of the book. For those who like to write with eloquent periphrastic flair, they will probably find the writing space on these pages is far from adequate."
5,Cultivating an attitude of gratitude,"I've heard in order to have a happy life we have to practice the habit of being a good finder. Whatever we go looking for that is what we find. The practice of the habit of finding good, and being grateful on an everyday basis is a real changer for my life, and this helps to make it a daily habit. I like to use mine in the evenings, typically when I can fall into the bad habit of grumbling about the normal every day stress-ors of life. Being grateful helps me to be more content and treat others more respectfully, which of course then translates into me getting more out of my own life."
2,Nowhere near as good as the first one,"Bill and Ted are a little older now and so their naive, dumb personnas don't work as well as the first time around. The Station character is non-non-heinous and seems totally out of place. The Grim Reaper is great though and the scene where Bill and Ted battle with the Reaper via Milton Bradley games is one of my all time favorite cinema moments."
5,Dantes Inferno Revisited,This is the most tubular movie evermade man! It is so Dante's INfernoesque! I Loved it and so will you! This is a Hell Raising experience that everyine should have the opprirunity to see! Go NOW! Got get it! GO OWN IT NOW!
4,Good Goofy Comedy,"Bill & Ted II, BOGUS JOURNEY has the wacky duo meeting themselves in a dangerous heavy-metal form. Good and Evil. Hell and Music. Special Effects make the rating for 4-stars. IMHO, it is not as good as the first."
1,No Communication,"I was not pleased with the service. My book arrive within the time alloted, 7-14 days it arrived the 13th day without the cd's. By then class had started. Emailed the seller about the issue, I never got a reply. Good thing my instructor had extra's.Overall poor communication made this an unpleasurable transaction."
1,Unhappy about missing battery,"Bought the Camera, Charger and the kit as part of the deal. Every thing looks good except the missing NPF-50 Battery. Requested for a replacement.In the replacement kit also battery was missing. Returned both the items.59.99 for a Carry bag and 3 DVD sis not worth buying this item"
2,Not for DCR-DVD 505,"Main problem: it is WAY too small. It has room for the camera, and pretty much nothing else. None of the stock accessories like charging cords and such fit in it, much less any add-ons you may have bought or blank DVDs. This means you'll need a second case for all your accessories. I suppose it would be ok for a day bag if all you wanted to carry was the camera, but it just doesn't cut it as a main storage bag.Second problem: the battery is a joke. It is about half the thickness of the stock battery that comes with the DCR-DVD 505 (which itself, is two steps down from the highest capacity battery Sony offers as of 5/06). I don't even want to speculate on how quickly it would run out.In short, this kit is useless for the current generation of cameras. Buy a separate bag (I'm about to order the Sony LCSVA5) and if you need a spare battery, get a quality one."
2,Sony case,"The case is nice, but the plastic clasp broke on the original order as well as a replacement."
4,Good Bargain,I think this carry case is a good buy. The only down side is the bag doesnt have enough room to carry all of the plugs and av wires and accessories.
5,love it,These bags are easy to switch out and they come with a cap so you don't get a billow of dust in your face.
1,DOES ABSOLUTELY NOTHING!! DON'T WASTE YOUR $,"[[ASIN:B000BPL0XA My Lines Are Concealed]THIS STUFF DID NOTHING FOR MY SKIN!!I'M 55 & I COULD TELL NO DIFFERENCE (NONE) THESE WOMEN THAT USED THIS & HAD GOOD REVIEWS MUST BE LIKE 20 YEARS OLD & PROBABLY DON'T HAVE ANY REAL PROBLEMS WITH THEIR SKIN, SUCH AS WRINKLES YET,BELIEVE ME I WISH IT WOULD WORK, THIS IS JUST ANOTHER ITEM THROWN IN MY DRAWER,A WASTE OF MONEY!!(My Lines Are Consealed Face Lift for A Day) HOW ABOUT RENAMING IT FACE LIFT FOR A SECOND) (IF THAT LONG)"
3,Andrew's Review,"The story, An Occurance at Owl Creek Bridge, had vivid descriptions of the scenery. It gave me an idea of what people might think about before they die.I would not recommend it, because overall, to me, it was boring. It was hard to understand the first time I read the short story. However, the second time it was more clear to me what was happening. It was confusing the way the author went from dream to reality."
3,Title is wrong,The book is fine. But your title states this is a book of the complete short stories and it is not. Your editor states that five of the war stories are not included.
5,excellent!!!,the whole series is great! I wish there were as many sequels as in the original lone wolf series!
1,Book Of Lies,Mr.Camping needs to take a REAL good look to what The Bible TRULY says in Matthew 24:36.It's just a shame that alot of people lost thier money over this clown.It just goes to show you.People will believe ANYTHING and/or ANYBODY.I just heard that old man Camping is buying into the whole Mayan Dec. 21 garbage as well.Oh no.Here we go again...
4,lifesaving product,"The Hospital gave me these shells when I had my baby almost 4 weeks ago. They were a lifesaver! I probably would have given up on breastfeeding if these hadn't fixed my flat nipples and relieved pain from breastfeeding. It is kind of annoying that they collect leaking milk though - esp. when you're not prepared when you remove them - it can make a real mess. Otherwise, I loved this product and I would definitely recommend them over all other breastfeeding acessories for sore nipples."
3,They look funny but do the job,"Instead of these, buy SoftShells. TheraShells look under the shirt kind of funny, they don't feel as good as SoftShells either. On the other hand, except the look, there is not much to complain, they do the job well enough."
5,Amazing sound and comprehensive collection,"Amazing sound quality and a more comprehensive selection than the recent ""Greatest Hits"" CD for just a few dollars more makes this the definitive one-package EW&F collection and the place to start for those curious about the late-1970s number one R&B/funk outfit."
4,Shining Stars,"If ""The Best of EWF, Vol. 1"" or ""Greatest Hits"" isn't enough and ""The Eternal Dance"" is too much then this limited edition compilation should suffice. The selections were handpicked by frontman Maurice White and cover 1973-83, their most productive years. Not all the tracks here were released as singles (e.g. ""Reasons""), but those album cuts are familiar to fans anyway. If you're just getting to know EWF, this is a great place to start. Better yet, this may be as far as you need to go."
1,Don't Get This!,"Although this says it is still in pre-order, I received my copy on May 24. I am a huge Memphis fan and was excited to get a copy of all of the games in the Final Four so I could do a better job of analyzing what was going on. Can't happen. THIS IS ONLY A HIGHLIGHTS DVD, under no circumstances is this anything near any entire game. You see a dunk when its a 2 point game then the next shot is during a 10 point game. This is completely incoherent."
3,"Great Pacifier, No Glow","My babies love Avent pacififers, so as a pacifier, I have no complaint. However, I bought this particular model because sometimes, at night, my daughters would toss their pacifiers out of the crip or loose them on the crib and I couldn't find them.Unfortunately, the glow lasts right after they've bee exposed to light, and only lasts for a few seconds. So, I'm a little dissapointed with them.."
4,Funny and of good quality,"It's fun and is a standard-quality product, but it's not exactly as I expected because the illusion isn't as perfect as on some pictures shown! But not regretting the purchase, fast international shipping, thanks!"
5,Hilarious!,"This was hilarious... the perfect gag gift for a young relative that's a new father and scared to death of it. Doubt that it's super functional because it seemed a little top heavy, but that wasn't my purpose."
4,Gift,I purchased this item for a friend that had a baby and she loves it!I am happy to have made her baby look silly!
2,"A simple thought on ""Hiroshima Mon Amour""","Hiroshima Mon Amour is the first foriegn film with sub-titles I've watched. I watched it for my film class.It was very slow, but the music helped push it along. The music helped set the mood for the graphic images it portrayed.I found the plot confusing, all the changes in time made it hard to follow. It was like a documentary gone bad. I think the love story made it cheaper, especilally since it was an affair.I did like however, the tie ins with the affair and the bombing. That was creative, although not a film I would sit at home and watch on a Saturday night."
2,"Misguided, to say the least","The Bottom Line:A film that seems more like a project from film school than something people would still praise a half-century after its release, Hiroshima Mon Amour is a bizarre combination of romantic narrative and documentary about the atomic bomb which fails completely to find a compelling reason for its own existence; one of those films that people praise primarily because it's different, without looking to see if there's anything of substance behind the iconoclasm of the director, this is a film that should be viewed only by those who wish to study the cinematic equivalent of a dish which combines candy corn and foie gras.2/4"
1,A huge diapointment for a long time fan,"What happened?! I have listened to UL since Blue Room came out years ago and this is total crap. Seriously. CRAP! These guys are capable of so much more. I mean, maybe if you like trendy, meaningless lyrics and polished teeny-bopper music, this cd may be good for you. If you are a long time fan of a band that used to be play decent punk rock like myself, don't even waste your money. I have been to several UL shows over the years and own every album, and this is disgraceful to their talent. If you are new to the band, I would suggest buying Oz Factor or the self-titled album. They are wonderful cd's and are still on my favorites list. Here's to the Morning unfortunatley will never grace my cd player again. It is directed towards a totally new audience this time and I guess I am not a part of it. Scott Russo, why did you have to sell out?"
2,Poor Quality,The business that shipped the product did a good job. The product itself is not at all worth the cost. It doesn't look as good in person as it does online. It is very poor quality even by made in Taiwan standards. I've seen the same type item in Best Buy and it is significantly better made and all said and done costs about $3 more than this one when you include shipping. I wish I would have spent 3 more dollars.
1,"Save Your Money, Don't Bother","In a word, this product: sucks. I received this as a Christmas gift and it was a big disappointment. To start with, it's poorly made- it looks like something a 6-year-old made at summer camp. Secondly, it seems to only fit Ipod Mini's correctly. I had to jam my 20g in there and it kept sliding out. Good luck with getting a 40g in there... Next, you can't use the click-wheel on the Ipod behind the thick plastic screen so forget about volume control or skipping a song. What a huge rip off. Last, the armband probably will fit a 6-year-old, everyone else will have loss of circulation problems. Amazon really should re-evaluate working with this vendor."
5,Enchantment,"After hearing only 1 cut from this album, I bought it right on the spot. If you think you have heard every rendition of Disley classics you ever want to, think again. There is not one single cut on this album that is not completely mesmerizing. Turn down the lights, light a candle, and completely relax with someone special, and by the end, if you can scrape yourself up, you'll replay the entire thing."
2,doesnt hold charge,"this is a product that holds true to the statement "" you get what you pay for"" it doesn't come close to the performance on the factory battery. it is good only as a back up, but not as the primary battery. if you want the performance equal to a factory unit buy a factory unit. if your primary runs out and you only need a few more pictures this is fine."
1,POOR LIFE....NOT RECOMMENDED,Bought 2 of these fron ADORAMA and I am not happy. I get about 50 shots w/ my Panasonic TZ5 camera and the battery is DEAD. My OE battery is good for 300-400 shots.
2,Lenmar DLP007,"I have four of these I purchased as backup batteries for my Panasonic Lumix TZ4 & TZ5. I'm an property/casualty insurance adjuster. I take hundreds of photos a day when in the field. When I first bought the batteries (approximately 1.5 yrs ago), they worked nearly as well as the original Panasonic batteries(200 to 300 photos at 640 res). However now they are good for 40 photos or less after a ""full"" charge. The original batteries are still performing like ""new"". I rotate all the batteries, including both the Lenmar and Panasonic, so they have all had approximately the same use and charge cycle. I've recently purchased two CTA & two Kinamax replacement batteries and will see how they perform."
1,The gimmick falls flat,"The gimmick of this guide to correct word choice lies in its mock-gothic style, à la Edward Gorey, with improbably passages illustrating the words defined. But the gimmick falls flat by trying far too hard. I loved Gordon's ""Paris Out of Hand,"" but in this book the mock-gothic prose is half-baked and monotonous."
2,Live at Full House,"Buy this to collect the TSC in full, as I did. I'd still have bought it, if I'd known it was the worst TSC concert I've heard. It goes less than 40 mins too.I was looking forward to hearing songs from ""The Cost of Loving"" LP, but (like every tune on this concert), ""Heavens Above"", ""Walking the Night"" have most of the melody taken out of them.""Heaven's Above"" (my favourite tune on the original studio album) is played much faster, and without the great sound on ""Cost of Loving.""There wasn't one song on here I actually enjoyed, and visually the council's outfits didn't have the same debonair look of ""Showbiz"" (a much better concert to be released on the upcoming 2008 ""Style Council on film"" DVD.)"
5,"'The Master and Margarita', a story for our time!","I read a lot.I read a lot of fine books by excellent writers.I would say Michail Bulgakov has crafted one of the best stories I have ever read, but what puts it in my 5 star camp is the message this story delivers and how Bulgakov structures the narrative in such an intelligent and unique way.At it's end one feels the long length of the book is worthy of the story. And what a story......Stalinist Soviet Russia, Pontius Pilate, The Devil, magic, a love story, a writer and riotous carrying's on. Yet, by the finale the message is quite clear.Read it."
1,Bad batch or poor editing...,"My Russian husband bought this book for me because he had researched and decided this was the best translation. While this may be the case (I don't know about that), the typos in this book are ridiculous! It is literally hard to get beyond the first chapter because of them. Excerpt complete with typos as seen in the book: ""As to his teeth, he haid platinum crowns on his left side and gold ones on his tight. [...] Right eye black, left ieye for some reason green."" I admit that I am particularly sensitive to this kind of thing, and I understand one or two errors getting by an editor, but this book is riddled with them and it makes it difficult to read, at least for me since every typo is like a hiccup in the flow of a sentence."
4,Great start for a new series,"Miss Amelia Prentice is a forty something English teacher in upstate New York. Not exactly the most exciting life in the world, but that is soon to change. While copying a woodcut of the Globe Theater for her class, she trips over the body of a former student. Who would murder Marguerite LeBow? Apparently there is alot more going on in the town than Miss Prentice is aware of.This was a surprisingly good cozy. I initially picked it up and put it down after the first chapter, and I am happy I picked it up again. The characters were very well developed and realistic and the mystery had many unexpected twists. I look forward to the next one."
2,Boring & Predictable !!,IRREGARDLESS Of MURDER was a predictable mystery which made this book a chore to get through. I will not be buying any more books by Ellen Edwards Kennedy any time soon !!
1,"Good movie, horrible DVD transfer","While this is a good movie, it is a horrible DVD transfer. It skips and jumps. Wait for a better transfer."
4,A Good Introduction,"If you are a Baptist of any kind, but specifically an American Baptist, and you want to know where our faith began and what influenced it to become what it is today, this is the book for you. It shares briefly and understandably about Baptist history, and then lays down some basic Baptist theological distinctions. And the author does this well. I highly recommend it."
4,Gives Insight to the History of Baptist,This is a great book to have if you have a desire to know how did the Baptist denomination originate and what are their beliefs.
4,The Way to read the Way,The book is a compilation of stories describing everyday events in the time of the samurai. It connects you to history and should be compared to Machiaveli's work.
2,Not very durable,"This mat lasted me for less than a year. At first, I loved it. It was sticky and had nice cushioning. Under moderate use, it started peeling. It also lost its stickiness very quickly. I'm very disappointed in it as Hugger Mugger usually makes excellent yoga products."
2,Undecided,"When I bought this mat a couple years ago, I was looking for a longer mat. I'd find my nose or toes hanging off one end or the other of my standard-size mat (I'm 5'10""). The lack of PVC and the somewhat Earth-friendly material led me to this mat rather than other longer mats.Early-on, the mat was both too sticky and too slippery. The slightest moisture made it slippery, and it is sticky when dry. Two or three times I stubbed my big toe in a big, painful way going from down dog to lunge. I do have a certain amount of excess girth that gets in the way of some maneuvers but I never stubbed my toe while using my first PVC mat. My leader thinks the mat is too sticky. The slipperiness was gone after a month or two.I practiced twice a week for much of the past two years but practice only sporadically now. There are some cracks but no tears or gouges. I would not buy this mat again."
2,"No a good book, and used for a horrible class","The seller shipped it quick that was great, but the book it self is not for me. If you already have a basic knowledge and an extensive vocabulary. You may enjoy this."
1,Ugh,"I can't understand how anyone can like this movie. I dunno, maybe I've been spoiled by Toy Story and the like, but this movie was simply not good. The musical numbers reeked and the characters were annoying, especially the whiney blonde chick who looked like she was half asleep most of the time and that bimbo of a nutcracker with that idiot grin of his. There's no way I'd pay $1 for this movie, let alone $14."
3,A twist of muppets and cartoons characters,"This movie look interesting in it preview, however it did not hold my 3 year old attention. I thought he would like it because it was full of color and great singing. What really turn him off is that he did not like the interruption of the cartoon character mix with the muppets. He perfer just the muppets characters."
2,A reader's defeat,"As the past reviewer I did not arrive to the page with THE END printed on it, and I really hate to be unable to finish a book. Anecdote aside, I am aware that my review lacks proper grounds, but since there is so much to read and too little time, I strongly suggest you to look for other works of this author. During the first chapter I seems to be going great, the drama was cleaver and catchy. But suddenly in the second chapter it just stops and all the events seem to be going nowhere. Besides the construction of the language is boring and confusing. It feels like the author worked in this novel for a while, then left it during some years locked in a closet and one fine day decided to complete it, but without being at ease doing so."
4,A forgotten classic of Faulkner,"It seems every modernist attempted to write a great work concerning the great war (except fitzgerald, who didnt get to go himself). Faulkner's attempt may be second only to Hemingway's ""A Farwell to Arms."" ""A Fable"" is classic, which won the pulitzer prize,has long been overlooked simply because it represents a change from Faulkner'susual subject matter. In reality though, it may be his second greatest work behind ""the sound and the fury."" THis work is a brillian anti-war novel that looks at wars affects both on soldiers and civilians, and even on religion. A must read for any fan of Faulkner or modernism."
1,Terrible Tech Support,"This cable modem and wireless functions of this device seemed to be operational, but any time I tried to have two computers hooked up simultaneously, both computers would lose their connection with the gateway. This was indeed frustrating, but technical support failed to resolve the problem after a month of exasperating phone calls and one product exchange. I was twice promised a return call within 24 hours, and twice unapologetically snubbed.I have been extremely disappointed and discouraged with this experience, and I am not inclined to ever purchase another Netgear product. I have returned this product and decided to go with Linksys after a recommendation from my systems administrator."
3,Small Burp Cloths,"I ordered these to have at my home for when my 7 week old grand-daughter comes to visit. I was surprised by how small they were -- realistically, babies are not neat and tidy with burping and a larger cloth, perhaps the size of a cloth diaper, would have been better. The quality is nice and I love the fact that these are organic but they are almost better to use as a washcloth!"
2,Poor quality,"I do not normally write reviews, however, the product I ordered, the organic burp cloths, was not the item I received. Although I should contact the seller, the item I received, which was a pack of 2 organic round bibs (smaller than normal bibs, primarily for drool and spit-up), was okay AND I'm 9 1/2 months pregnant and don't have the time or energy to deal with returning something that I can use. However, buyers beware, the item I ordered was not the item I received, and although I haven't used or washed the cotton mini-bibs yet, the are not the best of quality. My thought was, organic would be nice, but they seem very cheaply made. We will see. Either way, not impressed and just wanted to give everyone else a heads up on this!"
1,Superficial to an extreme,"There is a crying need for new histories of the Cold War based on revelations, especially from Soviet sources, but also from declassified American material released since the end of the period. This is not it. Covering the 40+ years in less than 300 pages implies some superficiality, but Gaddis' approach makes the effort essentially worthless. He also has to take the obligatory slap at McCarthy without bothering to admit that ""we now know"" (the title of another Gaddis work) that declassified material has largely shown that he told the truth and his detractors consistently lied. He then digresses into a ludricrous analysis of nuclear strategy that coincides with no known theory. He has dumbed the entire process down to a horrible degree and the entire enterprise is awash in political correctness."
3,Spectacular,"Simply spectacular. I only wish the book were twice as large and twice as detailed. There is so much to cover, for example, that the Cuban Missile Crisis receives only one page.Gaddis has written much on the cold war, and this was, for all intents and purposes, his attempt to ""dumb it down"" to a more accessible survey. In this he has succeeded, and from here I will turn to his other, more detailed writing on the period."
1,Buy a newer one.,This wouldn't be bad if it were done within the last ten years but it's so hopelessly out of date now that you're better off buying something more recent.
5,Perfect Replacement item,"I recommend this item if you wash your pump parts in a dishwasher or a sink with a disposal. These are the smallest pieces of the Medela Harmony manual breast pump, and can be easily lost. I received two valves and two membranes in the manufacturer-original packaging as pictured."
3,"Hardly mind-altering, but good.","I'm very picky about fiction, and when I read that this collection of stories had been a finalist for the NBA, I was expecting something more than what I got. Bloom is good at writing a certain type of story -- it starts off with an interesting hook that grabs your attention; proceeds in a very conversational tone about characters who are usually confused (in one story VERY confused); and sort of peters out without any real climax or deepened insight. I found these stories very agreeable and sometimes provocative (the woman who sleeps with her stepson, in particular.) But all in all, even thoush some of these stories are interrelated and examine the same characters from different vantage points, the characters still lacked richness. Nevertheless, as I said at top, I'm very picky about fiction and would still recommend this book to someone who wants to read a short story collection."
2,Thought it would be better....Look at Something Else!,"Fighting In Hell at some pionts was like ""Reading In ****"" The book is on Personal passages of four German Commanders in the Eastern Front. For someone doing a school report on this subject, the book would have some good info. At some points in the book it is suggested what to wear in really cold weather, etc., For the average reader (like myself) looking for a good read with action, this is not the book. I did learn some new things that I was not aware of previously however, I could not wait to finish this book, it was boring and too long. I'm glad it was only a seven dollar book! I would not buy this book again!!!"
3,Missionary Nuns~Beyond Duty,"Irish Missionary Sisters arrive in China and encounter a country plagued by bandits, civil war and Red Revolutionaries. After offering nursing to General Dolittle's flyers the sisters suffered the revenge of Japanese soldiers. The sisters suffered daily distresses while ministering to people suffering leporsy, malnutrition, tuberculosis, poverty and all ailments of a war torn country. Their good works were extended through hospitals, clinics and schools. They survived all hardships except the Communist government. They were expelled from the country in 1951. The clinics and hospital still survive in Hong Kong. These sisters gave above and beyond duty through love. Uplifting read."
2,Carbon copy,"I bought ""Black Halo"" at the prompting of my college-aged sons and loved it, so I went out and got Karma, Epica, and Fourth Legacy. All are carbon copies of Black Halo (I don't know which was released first, I'm just going by when I got them). Since I can't return opened media, I'll make money off them at a yard sale. Really disappointed. But Roy Khan has a KILLER voice. LOVE to hear him sing, even if it is the same thing every time. Get Black Halo if you want to try this band. The first track on that CD is the best one of ALL their CD's."
3,OK Film,Fair story line/love story - see it for the beautiful scenery and great music score. Recommended for those reasons.
3,The last scene... the best to remember!,"There is a scene in ""The Greek Tycoon"" that I consider the best scene of the film...It was Sunset... The sun was disappearing below the horizon... The sea at its ever-changing wave style... The waves--in all its moods, clear and calm, mysterious, awesomely threatening-- were beating under the old rocks...Anthony Quinn (fabulous as always) was standing alone in front of this wonderful view...The sky was offering the best looking effects of red and yellow lights... In the horizon some pale clouds were escorting the sun to another world... Tomasis was truly flavoring the moment... The beauty of this great view invited him to dance, to slowly move his hands and legs, to feel the fresh air, to hear the sound of music, to smell the salt of the sea...Tomasis' dance was a farewell to a world he cherished... This beautiful scene makes me meditate about human life: God's 'greatest gift'... Sometimes we forget this precious present..."
5,THIS SHOULD BE A CLASSIC.,"I am suprised that no one had commented on this book.I know it's a little out dated but the words still ring true even for today.Let's get started:The forces allied against the individual have never been greater.Totalitarianism typically begins when a would be tyrant-whether a Hitler or a Castro play's upon the anxieties of the majority to institute repressive measures against despised or troublesome minorities.The same society that breeds criminals by the millions demands that it's police catch the criminals,even if they must trample on constitutional rights and existing laws to do so.Please, read this book if you want to know what was going on in this country back in the 50's and 60's.It is packed full of information.Here is a little information from the contents.Are we conditioning students to police state tactics,The right to a private unfettered life,The right to be free of bureaucratic harassment,The right to be free of mind manipulation."
1,Do not purchase the Kindle edition for this book!!,"This is a great book but do not purchase the Kindle edition. I needed this book for a college class and I had a Kindle so I decided to purchase it for my Kindle. Well when I started reading the assignments the book they were using in class was not matching up with what I was reading on my Kindle. Some of chapters are similar but it's missing a lot of chapters. When you click on the Kindle edition it gives you a book with a different name ""Journey into God's Word"" and even though Amazon says it's the Kindle edition for this book it's not! I would recommend you stick with the paper copy of ""Grasping God's Word"" until Amazon gets this issue fixed."
4,Good value,I bought these for my girlfriend and she loves them. They appear to be very well made and keep her feet warm which was the goal.
4,Good for the price,These slippers do run small. I wear a size 9 and my toe touches the end a bit but it is not a problem. I do not go anywhere that I need toe room. These type of slippers stretch out and get floppy so a size larger would be too large. They are warm and I would purchase them again especially for the price. Cannot beat it.
3,Nice and warm,"I got these on a lightning deal. It's my first purchase of shearling slippers, and since the bargain was phenomenal, I decided to give them a try.The shearling is soft, but not nearly as soft as microfiber. I wear a half size, so ordered the next size up and the fit is good. The slippers are comfortable and fairly sturdy, but clearly will not last as long as my washable slippers do.I'm glad I got to try these, and yes, I wear them. I appreciate Amazon offering them at such a low price because otherwise, I wouldn't have tried shearling slippers. I know that a lot of people love their shearling, but I know now that shearling isn't for me. If I buy at regular prices, the return on investment is low."
2,Poor fit,I had to return these because they were too narrow. I usually wear a 7.5 but read these run small so I got a 9. The length was right but my toes still felt squished because they were too narrow. I ended up finding a different brand and love those.
3,Too Big but beautiful,I read a lot of reviews and ordered a size 10 as many reviewers said the slipper ran small. NOT! I wear a size 9.5 shoe consistently and the 10 slipper fell right off. Could not walk in it safely. Back for the 9.
5,The slippers are exactly as described. Loved & extremely WARM!,These shearling bootie slippers are grrrrreat! Arrived on time and in great condition. I am happy & would purchase again from this company.
5,Wonderful slippers,"Bought 1/2-size larger than I normally wear, thanks to good advice from reviewers.These are excellent value for sheepskin slippers - the lining is natural wool & not synthetic.The warmest, nicest slippers I've ever owned."
5,Beats a $300 router lift,"Simple, easy to use, fits the router well. You do need to unlock the router to adjust the height, but that is due to the design of the router (not the base)."
4,Easy setup,I bought this fixed base to go into the table that I purchased. The tee handle hex key is great to allow topside adjustment. Just remember to check the depth after you lock the motor again as it does tend to move a little.
5,Widge,"I like this product when using my Bosch combo kit on my router table. This base allows me to adjust the router bit height from above the router table by using the included Hex Key. In additon, I can leave this base permanently attached to the router table. I simply pull the motor out of the base that's attached to the router table and then stick it into one of the other router bases when I want to use the router freehand. Very convenient."
4,Used for router table mounting,"The RA1165 is a fixed base with out the knobs. I mounted it under a router table so I wouldn't have to use my fixed base that came with the router kit. So now all I have to do is transfer the router motor from fixed, to plunge, to table, for the different processes. Not as fancy as a router lift, but works for my occasional use."
4,A forgotten Ibsen classic.,"I saw a rare production of this Ibsen play at the National Theatre of Great Britain in the 1970's with Sir Ralph Richardson, Dame Wendy Hiller and Dame Peggy Ashcroft, and I became very fond of it. This is a play that wonderfully showcases three major characters in their 60's or 70's, surrounded by younger people whose vivacity is a sharp contrast. It takes place in an icy Scandinavian winter, in an icy Scandinavian house, filled with people whose emotions are anything but cold. When reading this play, you must imagine it spoken, as it was intended. You have here a rarely performed masterpiece by a master playwright, and the translation to English is very good indeed!"
2,Flimsy,"I ordered these with the concept that they were the sturdy, enameled Wilton cutters I love to use. They are colored aluminum and easily bendable. Arrowed heart shape is not exact (no point to arrow), so any decoration is topical, not exact. These are okay for beginners but not for bakers who do more professional decorating. Disappointed."
4,Amazing tabla guide,This is an ideal book for beginners. It has excellent reference points and is really in depth with the history and evolution of the tabla. This is a must have for anyone who plays or is very interested in listening to the tabla. For instance my uncle is obsessed with the tabla and he found this book fascinating in teaching him new tips and methods. For the beginner this is the real look into Indian folk music. I strongly recommend that you read this book if you appreciate indian folk music
2,Too expensive,"This is a first impression review. As the Preface says, the majority of this book consists of appendixes (over 150 pages): list of tals (which, as the autor says, are in some cases extremely old or rare) of prakars, a map of India, how to write the bols (the drum strokes) in Dev Nagri (by the way, all drum strokes syllables throughout the book are written in latin script with the corresponding Dev Nagri above, making space for redundancy), sources where to buy tabla (why use internet?) etc.. I couldnt help but to notice the poor quality of the impression (you can actually see the dots in the black and white photos, but I does not affect the comprehensibility). Overall it seemed to me that the book could be much more compact and that perhaps would make it less expensive."
1,It wasn't easy to understand. I had no clue!,"I wanted to learn tabla so I decided to pick up a book and try. The first few chapters seemed easy enough. Then, all of a sudden, the book went into intrigate details. It just didn't make any sense."
1,Not another Ravenwolf book.,"Huzzah for the reader from the US for calling it like it is. As a Pagan and an owner of a metaphysical bookstore, I have read a considerable amount of books on Paganism and Witchcraft. To tell you the truth Ravenwolf is just the kind of author the the movement doesn't need. Save your money for something with a little more seriousness. Try the Farrar's or Cunningham's earlier work."
1,Amazed,"I give a one to the writer because they know how to capitalize on their own magical economical development. Amusing. Keep going, there are still new people falling off the tomato truck every day."
3,Great for kids,"Ok Ok.. I like Silver do not get me wrong but, umm was this book made for kids and teens only? The story in the beginning is pretty cute to read and is full of usefull samhain information but, it is not very adultish. There needed to be an expanded recipe area and just.. well she could have made a soo much better book with all her knowledge. Overall though if you are looking for a book to share with your youngens and you just need some quick holiday ideas this would be a great start."
3,okay,"This book had some interesting and funny facts...got alittle lonnnnnnng, so it took awhile to get through it...it was okay"
3,It's ok,I'm a brand new whittler and this guy is a tad dry for me. Or perhaps a little intimidating. All the wood carving stuff is beside my point. Good stuff; I just don't love this book.
5,Box Of Hair,"I heard that Cub broke up. If it's true it's truly tragic. Cub are a female trio from the Great White North who specialize in sugary-sweet pop gems with a very little bit of a country feel. Sometimes they remind me of The Fastbacks. They play clean with little or no distortion & make good use of light-hearted humor. The Last 2 tracks ""Riverside"" & ""Not What You Think (Live)"" show that they can do much more than the seemingly empty cutsie pop songs. Their pop songs, however, are not as vacuous as they may appear to be on the surface. They are smart, creative & heart warming. I don't know if this is Cub's best album, because they are all so good, but I do know that if bands like Heavenly, Go Sailor & Butterglory make you happy, then so will Cub."
1,Did not work with HD size 750GB,"I bought this to upgrade my HD to a size 750GB. It did not work, the software came with it was very old and gave me a message something like ""different partition size between the 2 drives, not supported"" I went online and download Acronis Migrate Easy 7.0. It's free for 15 days. It also gave me an error message saying there are bad partition in my computer's HD and I need to fix those first. I ran the disc error check but everything was fine. Took me whole day nothing worked.I ended up went to best buy and bought a USB 3.0 case ""Rocketfish"" and use the Acronis Migrate Easy 7.0 free demo to clone the HD. Everything was done within 2 hours. So If you are buying a bigger HD, I say don't buy this. I think the problem is there is no power cord, it doesn't support the bigger HD. The Rocketfish I bought has 2 USB connector and I connect both, the computer saw the disc right away."
4,Hard drive cloner,It works excellent but one prob which is why i gave it a 4 since we had a d400 (older computer)it kept power surging because it does not come with power cord because powered by computer so we called company they told us what kind of power adapter to use we went to radio shack got one hooked it all up used it works really fast! So if you have older computer make sure you get power adapter!
5,Laptop HD copy system,Excellent product. Worked like a charm. An inexpensive way to save a laptop with a failing hard drive. I definitely recommend it.
5,Upgraded Thinkpad T60 HDD no problem,"Disclosure -- did not buy this from Amazon. The hard drive in my refurb Thinkpad was getting iffy. sometimes clicky. I was really worried about trying to back up to a cloned drive, because I had heard terrible tales of new hdd's that wouldn't boot. After googling a bit, I found that the recommended solution is: install the new HDD in your T60, and use the adapter and enclosed disk to copy the old drive via usb. Install the new hdd, attach the old hdd to the device, plug it in. Boot the T60 using the disk that came with. Follow the instructions, and make sure to select the correct drives for source and target. Very easy. Worked like a charm! Booted up with no problem at all."
1,LWatLA,"If you had a rating of -100 it would be rated below that. The case is solid but has no on & off switch. The soft ware program is rip rip rip off. no customer service. Still have not heard back from them.I would not advise my worst enemy to buy this product. It was awast of time, money & efor. do not,do not buy this product."
1,No Support,Ordered despite seeing reviews cautioning about poor documentation and situations where product does not work. Attempts to contact Apricorn via phone (800# on product for example) or email were waste of time.One review found via Google suggested a situation similar to my experience and possible solution/workaround. Cannot find the article again. Have to wonder why Apricorn cannot provide same info.The reviews noting poor support were correct.
1,"JUNK DON""T BOTHER ONE STAR IS TOO GOOD.","I am sick and tired of buying junk that does not work as advertised. I have a Lenovo T500 and evidentlly the software is not compatible with Lenovo Models. I want to upgrade my 320gig 7200 sata drive to a WD 750gig 7200 and the software comes back saying that ""Copying between drives with different block sizes is not supported"". A visit to the website where an apparently bored customer service tech told me that I had to make several bios changes and remove my original drive and swap it for the new drive and run the copy backwards. That ""should"" work. I bought this product as it was ""EZ"".THIS PRODUCT DOES NOT WORK AS ADVERTISED."
3,laptop drive cloning,"Apricorn Universal EZ 2.5"" Hard Drive Upgrade Kit for All Notebook Computers - EZUPUNIVERSAL / EZ-UP-UNIVERSALSoftware is good but I could not use the hardware supplied with this kit as I had to buy a separate 2.5 usb enclosure to complete the clong job."
2,"A solid case, but lousy software","I got this kit today and tried to clone from an old 250 GB HDD to a new 500 GB. Firt followed their 1-2-3 procedure, ran app from Windows Vista, put new HDD as destination in the enclosure and copy from the HDD in the laptop. After finishing cloning (about 120 min to clone sector-by-sector), swapped the HDDs, it showed the boot manager error.Then I reversed the HDD copying, booted up from Apricom CD, source in the USB drive and the destination new HDD in the laptop, this time veryfying feature was turned on, but the same error message in the booting step, totally waisted me 3 hours.Good thing that I have Acronis TrueImage Home 2011 come to resue. the Acronis CD booted the laptop and cloned the HDD for about 100 minutes, Then the new drive in the laptop booted up nicely.The enclosure is very solid, two stars.The software is totally waste of my time."
2,There are better books on the subject,"I would recommend the Peter David book or the Denny O'Neil DC Comics Guide To Writing before this one. It is priced right however. Not bad, but there are better options out there."
1,"A dweller on two planets; or, The dividing of the way","My great-great grandfather wrote this book before he become a Christian. At the time he was involved with a cult that frequently used transendentalist meditation. Everything he wrote, he clamied to have seen on other planets. After he became a Christian he rennonced the cult, the book and everything involved with it. I cannot recommend this book to anyone especially after the author clamied he made it all up and did everything in his power to get the book out of print."
2,"""Christmas"",Singer Unlimited","It was disconcerting to see that CD had belonged to a public library. I would have preferred to give my money directly to the library. Also, the jewel case was cracked. This could have happened during shipping which means packaging was not good enough to protect it. If not, it was shipped this way. I would not buy another product from this vendor."
4,Cellar Club Music,"This is the true essence of cellar club music of the 60's. I was fortunate to live in europe at the time of the British Invasion, as it were. The invasion started in the early 60's in europe and eventually spread to America in the mid 60's ,and at that time, the music was cleaned up and polished more than the early years for the American audience. It was those early years that you felt the true expression of the bands. Before the 'board room' people got hold of them. The true experience was the raw, wonderful,garageband sound of all the groups. Trying to produce an identity, and sound of their own. The music was best heard in the small clubs and bars where the bands started. If there are such places around you, go to them and listen to the local music...you'll love it !!!"
5,A+,"Finally!!!! A Steeple Hill Cafe book that is actually well written. I loved it! Well done for a new favorite author of mine. Great story of forgiveness, mercy and overcoming our regrets in life."
1,Surprisingly Dissappointing,"If I were Simon from ""American Idol"" I would have to vote to send Karen, James M., Missy and Tim packing. Knowing what Karen is capable of, having grown up listening,studying and idoling songs dating as far back as ""Pure Gold"" and ""Miracle"", this album dissappoints me. Missy and Tim are very talented individuals for what they do. However, Gospel music is Gospel music. Don't get it twisted, it's more than vocals, hooks and bringing in a ""big name"" producer to work on your project. . . IT'S A LIFESTYLE. It just didn't FEEL like genuine Gospel music. I was also distracted by the monotone-like lyrics and vocal arrangement in ""Second Chance."" Definitely not her best stuff."
3,Not Just For Children,"This a nice collection of lullabies that can be enjoyed by babies and young children as well as adults. Easy to sing along to and beautifully arranged. ""Reach Out For Me"" is a great song which comes at the end of the album. It's one of her more real and heartfelt albums."
3,hunger for healing book,I rate this book as ok. It was pretty shop worn. I have gotten other used books on amazon in very good condition that truly were like new. The pages were yellowed.
5,Great ACU ranger cap.,"I have bought 2 of these already,they are great caps,they are made in china but very nicely made,i have worn mine every day for a while now and many machine washes and the digital camo is still very sharp (no fadind in the wash) and the sewing is all still perfect,good product for the money."
5,epic,i got a medium it was way to tight but i put a slit in the back and its good now its really good looking and it has map pocket its like a pouch in the top of the inside of the hat id recommend getting it
4,It's fine.,"This plant is okay. Nothing spectacular, by any means, but it takes up some space in our 5-gallon tank and looks fine. The base doesn't seem extremely durable, but so far it has held up through being washed a few times. I do worry that the plants will separate eventually, but the price was low enough that it's fine.It's not really soft, but it isn't rough enough to hurt our Betta fish. It is definitely light-weight, too, but we bury it in the rocks and it stays put. I would recommend this as a basic aquarium plant."
4,"Awesome collection, but...","This is a GREAT collection of Phillip K. Dick's earliest short stories. Great writing all around. My only complaint is that there is a very repetitive feel as Dick is obsessed with two topics: war, and ""what does 'human' really mean?"" If you don't mind having the same points driven home page after page, it's a winner.J.Ja"
1,WARNING! This is a reprint of an earlier work!,"This collection was previously released as ""The Short Happy Life Of The Brown Oxford"" ISBN 0806511532. Don't be fooled by the new cover and title. It's being reissued under the title of the movie starring Ben Affleck and Uma Thurman. You probably already have the collection if you're a PKD fan. The 1 star rating is for the cheap attempt to get my money a second time."
4,Great CD,"Don't be fooled by the cover. This CD is great. It has upbeat lyrics and tempo to older songs. I love ""victory Chant"". Great to put you in the mood to praise."
3,OK as a reference,Hundreds of pages listing values. I would have liked more information on each auto. Also more inforamtive chapters.And more examples.
3,Good value for money,this pack did'nt leak like you would expect something at its price too. I will be ordering more. Though one complaint i have is it does'nt hold heat as long as i would expect
4,Little Guy Loves It!,My little guy is always so excited to get back home to play choo choo train. He is 2.5 but even his 6 y/o cousin loves to play it. This is not the most highly advanced set but with imagination you have an airport/ heliport and trainworld- and all the other toys have joined in too!
5,Belinda the NANA,"MY GRANDSON LOVES THIS.. SO PERFECT AND SO DURABLE.. HE LOVES HIS TRAIN SET AND LOVES THOMAS.. SO GREAT FOR THE PRICE. NOT JUST THE PRICE, WHAT A STEAL.. THANKS AMAZON.."
3,It's ok,Purchase book and it wasn't bound. Came with a folder and loose leaf hole punched pages that I had to load myself.
2,Wait for the patch!!,"Got this yesterday and played it all night. There are quite a few bugs and zero on-line support as of yet. They either don't do the damage they claim or it doesn't register. Cluster Bombs are cool but also don't appear to register the stated amount of damage. The install overwrites your joystick settings that you set up with the MW4 patch 2 version 2. Switching from chain fire to group fire etc doesn't ""stick"" and you have to keep re-switching. It may have been coincidence but after installing last night I tried a multiplayer session and we were ghosting and warping so badly that we couldn't play. I'll try it again but we didn't have that kind of trouble previously."
3,Great..normally,"I LOVE this scent on my husband, but I would recommend purchasing it in a store where you can verify the qualify of it--these discount perfumeries tend to sell products that just smell ""off"". Smells more like hairspray than cologne. If purchasing here, make sure the store that is selling it through Amazon is reputable."
4,without reservations,This is a suberb album with some of the most heartfelt songs in the world on it! My dad left this to me and I love it!
2,Not Saying Much....,"Saying this is the best Savoy Brown release in a number of years is not really saying a whole heck of a lot. True Simmonds can play a mean guitar, but so can dozens of other blues artists. What really bothers me about this disc is the weak vocals from Simmonds; and the musicians for hire approach. Just call this a Kim Simmonds solo album and I'll maybe add another star. This is just straight ahead, workmanlike, ""whiteboy"" blues in the tradition (or re-tread-ition) of John Mayall; however Simmonds is no Clapton, Green, or Taylor. I've listened to the disc a few times and the repeated listenings have done nothing to change my opinion. Now it's headed for auction on eBay.Unlike my vinyl copies of ""Blue Matter"" & ""Raw Sienna"" which I sleep with under my pillow. ""Lonesome Dave"" rest in peace."
2,Milkin' it lame,"Re-tread songs, helpless rhythm section, HORRIBLE singing...this is the worst CD I bought this year. Try to get some classic SB instead, because this sounds like it was recorded in someone's garage. Painful and sad. Milk it, Kim."
5,Local Band Big Sound!,"This is a local band (Boulder, Colorado) that has great sound. Just happened to see them live (as a warm up band) for my favorite artists (William Topley) and haven't taken their CD out of my multi disc player since I got it."
2,Frustration for little tykes. Skip this one.,"This is a frustrating toy for my young son. He loves the train toys and was excited to get this in the mail. However, I have to say that this has fast become a frustrating toy.The little man comes out of his seat and the top comes off the wheeled bottom. This happens continually, even when you are trying to roll up the little string to tow a train. I am thinking I""m going to take some glue and glue the top to the bottom and eliminate some of the frustration for my child.If Brio were to make it so these pieces clicked together then it would be a much better toy in my opinion.I'd skip this one. You can get some cute train cars and great tracks. Throw in a few little people and you don't need the little tow car...Again, I'd skip this one. The top comes off the bottom and doesn't stay attached while you are playing. Frustrating."
2,"Pretty, but don't buy","We purchased one of these because it was pretty, and had some neat features. What we didn't realize was that pretty doesn't make good coffee. Within a few short months, the timer and automatic start went out--shortly after, the fancy swing arm broke, too. We mailed it back and waited for a new one. Sure enough, the timer on the new one pooped out after just a few weeks, and a year later the arm broke *again*. Emails to the company (nice ones!!) were not returned. When we finally got in touch with them we were told that although this is a common problem, since it had been over one year we were out of luck. This product simply costs too much to dispose of after a year, especally as our $20, 7 year old Mr. Coffee still works better than the DeLonghi. Do yourself a favor and don't buy it."
3,Non-greasy non-sticky?,Although this lipgloss does moisture the lips and gives beautiful shine it is very greasy and very sticky. Don't buy it if you don't like sticky lip glosses!
3,Fairly Solid,"At its best, the music here flows like a Sunday drive on a country road; at its worst, it sounds like soft, soggy background music. If you like this album, you'll love what is perhaps the best duet album of all time: ""Blues For Two"" by Joe Pass and Zoot Simms. In fact, Pass and Simms create and sustain the kind of mellow blues atmosphere that Getz and Barron achieve only sporadically. [Is this the price for popularity?] Those who want to here Getz at his best should get his session with the Oscar Peterson Trio -- a session with a truly swinging, soulful edge."
3,The Butcher's Wife.,"Even though Demi Moore's accent was distracting & not consistant, this is a good watch. A psychic helps others but misses the mark when it comes to her own love life. Hapless Jeff Daniels, who can never hit stardom no matter what blockbuster he's in, co-stars in this movie as the psychiatrist. Mary Steenburgen also stars"
4,This one can be seen over and over again!,"If you like an off-beat movie full of irony,comedy,good music, and romantic twists(not to mention melodrama), then this is your movie. Never mind other movies with Demi Moore...this one is her best, and her best suited role ever. All the characters are kooky, even the ""shrink"". Just sit back and enjoy this over and over again!"
1,unbalanced,"This is an unbalanced view of the so-called AIDS epidemic in South Africa. Thabo Mbeki put his reputation on the line to challenge the AIDS orthodoxy. For his reactionary intransigence he is marked with pejorative epithets like denialist. He is vilified and demonized. He refuses to accept that the health of South Africans is declining because of their sexual behaviour, not poverty and underdevelopment. He opposes pushing toxic drugs on pregnant woman and their babies. This honest and hard working leader deserves recognition. There are fair and balanced books on the South African AIDS epidemic, this book is not among them.Errare humanum est sed diabolicum perseverare...."
2,"wow, they really phoned in this performance...","If you like seeing a band at less than optimum capacity, with warts and all then this one should be in your collection. Townsend and Daltrey really seem to be bickering back and forth about something. This Who DVD doesn't seem to have the ""fire"" of their other work."
3,Blast From The Past,I remember getting this cassette back in the 80's from Venture. I don't know what happen to it tho. This just has various hits from Ms. Ross. It's an OK collection; not like an Anthology or Greatest Hits.
2,"Good, but not great","As most writers grow older, their skills diminish. So with Enter the Milkman. A lot of the book is padding - each character repeating the same thing over and over again. MacLeod's books are humorous mysteries and the humor is there but the mystery is not that taxing. Her earlier books are masterpieces, so get this one to fill out the set."
2,Just OK,It's just like any other product of its kind. I have heard their quality gone worse ever since they started manufacturing outside Japan. Looks like its true.
3,Better than a trojan,"My husband likes this product better than any other condom that you can find at walmart (trojan, etc.) He says he can feel more with this condom then the others and have never had a problem with breaking!"
1,Too small,These condoms are no good. The first one I put on felt too tight and ripped while I was trying to put it on. The length is fine but not good if you have normal or above average girth.
4,Good,I'll buy again because they are only $9 but the color sucks cause they have a pink tint to them.
4,Its good for the price,Its comfortable and easy to wear........For the price it is worth to get...I would recommend them to any ....
5,Highly recommend this item,This condom is very high quality. The packages that I received were made in japan. Best one that I have tried. It was very difficult to break with my hands even though they are soo thin.I bought this and 2 other types from the same company. They all came lose in the shipping bag.
1,very very bad customer service and a totally rib off!!!,"I have ordered 20 of 12 okamoto crown condoms, the total price for the comdoms is a little over 30 dollors, but they charge me overm 90 for the shipping!! It is much more expensive than the pirce I can buy in the retails stores! They charge the pircie as 20 different shippment but they ship me as one package (very light and small). I thought that was one order, but they charge me as 20 orders. I guess the shipment only cost them less than 10 dollors (grand shipping by post office), what a rib off!!"
5,Best condom ever!,"I first saw these being used in the reality kings videos and wondered what kind of condom it was. I did some research and found it was the skinless skin now called crown condoms. I used to use Trojans and Durex but now I only use these. These are the most comfortable condom I've ever used! They go on easy and stay on, they are snug but not too tight or too loose, they're just right. I can feel so much with these it's very close to bareback and they have a very nice natural feel to them. Don't let the pink color fool you, the pink actually makes it blend in better with your skin. I usually buy these in the 100 pack, I'm a single guy so I do go through a lot of these. And you get the most bang for your buck if you buy in bulk. Yes it's true they did move production to Thailand but these still blow anything out of the water for the price. I've never never had one break on me yet! At least try the 12 pack for 2.xx seeming as though they're so cheap."
4,its a condom,"pretty good condom, and is a very good price. if you dont like condoms you still wont like this one. it also has very little lubercation, so have some handy."
4,Good stuff but not made in japan,"Good quality product. Ordered 24 and they came in a yellow bubble wrap envelope, no box or anything, not that Iind but perhaps others may. Used a few and they perform as expected. Design of the wrapper has changed from before. It is blue now and just says 'crown' with no mention of 'skinless skin' so it made be a bit surprised. No big deal though I later saw on another website that the wrapper design had changed. On further inspection I saw that these are manufactured in Thailand. I thought the old ones were made in japan but I forget.... As ling as it works as expected I don't mind where it's made. So, overall happy with the purchase."
2,cold blanket,i was enthralled with this when i first got it but the ice does not last that long and the rectangles are prone to breaking. great idea but not sturdy at all.
2,Disappointing,"I've never asked Amazon for a refund. This was a first. I read the reviews. All gave high ratings. My experience differs. Yes, the cashews are jumbo, in fact they're huge. However, they lacked flavor and many had a harder, more brittle texture then I'm use too. Oh well back to Planters."
3,Unnecessary,"When read the Flowers In The Attic thought that,t was the best book have ever read.Of course the other books of the series are also good ,except Garden of Shadows. I think t's an unnecessary book.If t hadnt written ,we would have thought Olivia is a merciless character.And we wouldnt think whether Corinne was right or not. Now we cant understand who is right.Malcolm was abondened by his mother and he is an unstable man. Nobody loved Olivia and she is merciless woman. Corinne was spoiled by her father.Her fate was readied by her family.Like Dresden Dolls... Althoght the book is nterestng the desprictions are long and many unnecessary sentences written."
5,Excellent Condition,"The book looks amazing. The quality was perfect, I can not wait to read the last book of this series."
5,I wish it didn't end,"As horrible and sad as this series was, I don't want them to end! I've never had so much fun reading. So much fun hating the characters & being grossed out by them or scared. Wonderful books! You forget everything going on around you."
1,I should have saved my money,"This is the first Spider Robinson I have tried to read. I'll take other's word for it that previous books were better. This one is smug, self-indulgent and boring. I kept waiting for them to save the universe and then skimmed through it because it was too silly. I like weird people but these were not interesting. The parrot was a stupid plot device, the baby is creepy (but that dancing baby always creeped me out, too), but I liked being reminded of Pixel. I kept picturing Hans Conried when we saw Nikola Tesla and I don't think that was the image we were supposed to get. I short, I didn't finish it. I should have checked these reviews before I bought it."
4,The gang's mostly back,"And it turnd out that not only are they supposed to save the planet, but the whole darn universe as well. And tired of the whole Long Island rat race, they're moving to Key West. (circa 1989 before it got gentrified and duller). Fun stuff for the most part, and I liked the tale, but the pacing's a bit slower than the earlier Callahan books, which were pretty much short story compilations, and even the Lady Sally ones, which had at least a few seperate stories in each. It just seemed to take a long time for anything to happen, and Erin is just a bit too precocious."
1,Not worth your while.,"There is much better music around.As largely exemplified by the comments below by the user from New Orleans, music - or whatever - that inpires, generates and promotes such a deluge of condescending, derogatory and hateful remarks towards others is clearly not worth your while.You will do much better spending your time and money elsewhere."
5,Good-natured fun,"I am totally hooked on Zoo Tycoon - it's intuitive, easy to learn, and loads of fun. The animal graphics are adorable - I love to watch my kangaroos hop around and my polar bear swimming in his pool. Or, if I'm feeling mean, I can drop a zebra or two into the lion exhibit. The only problem I have with the game is that you can't move objects once they are placed - you have to delete and replace them. I guess I'm spoiled from The Sims. Still, this is a versatile and addictive game which I think almost anyone would enjoy (except my luckless zebras, of course)."
3,Just a little boring,"I was uber excited to borrow this game from a friend before buying (luckily) but I was rather dissapointed. I love the zoo and animals and my favorite game is Rollercoaster Tycoon, so I thought it would be super fun. The interface is pretty much self explanatory, but the actual gameplay is boring. The only fun part is watching the animals. You don't really do anything exciting. You build the animal cages, which was very difficult at first, and you have to do it quickly before the animal gets uncomfortable and they take away your animal purchasing rights. I was constantly running out of funds. Definatly check it out for yourself if it hits the dollar bin, but don't break the bank over it."
4,Zoo Tycoon,"This game is overall, great! It is very addictive and fun to create your own zoo, but after a while the game gets boring. The setup of this game was easy, it even told you how to play while you are waiting. If you still don't understand this game, you can play one of the tutorials. Marine Mania (which includes Dinosaur Digs) adds even more fun to this game. This game is great."
4,"Good, But Roller Coaster Tycoon is Better","This Game allows you to create your own zoo, with lots and lots of different kind of animals, exibits, shops, and more! The Scenarios are allright, and the animals look really realistic! I would reccomend getting the double expansion pack also, so you can have water animals and dinosaurs in your zoo too. You can also download different animals and scenery on the original one, and put them in your zoo. It is pretty obvious Zoo Tycoon is competing with Roller COaster Tycoon. So if you buy this, get the double expansion pack with it or later, and the game will be well worth the money."
3,hard to follow and has no answers in the back,"This book could be good if a great professor was teaching with it. I had the misfortune of having another poor University of California, San Diego professor which made the book a priority to read. I found the book to be once again excessive in derivation and the problems required too much interpolation to make any good use of the tables provided. The tables were great however could not be used efficiently when solving problems, thus making homework sessions tedious rather than instructive."
1,Too many typos in this book,"I used this book when I took Heat Transfer last year. There's too many typos in this book in places where there should be no typos, such as with formulas. Not a whole lot of explanation for stuff in the book, and most of the examples aren't that helpful. In the end, we were told that we could use any heat transfer text on our final as an open-book test, and I ended up using a Schaums Heat Transfer book, as that book doesn't waste your time with derivations and isn't full of typos on key formulas and concepts.Schaum's Outline of Heat Transfer, 2nd Edition (Schaum's Outline Series)"
2,Inaccurate - Mr. Grobel didn't do enough homework!,"Many things written about Collin Green in this book are untrue, and Larry Grobel should have known better after meeting him in person. But apparently he chose to take the word of others without checking out whether it could be true or not, medically. How many other things did Mr. Grobel just take people's word on, without checking them out?!? Collin Green would certainly be justified in suing Mr. Grobel and the publisher to have those things removed from any future printings and is owed an apology!"
3,"Funny, But a Bit Much","I really enjoyed reading this book in Borders, but I did notice it has more sexual- and body function-related humor than BAD CAT, its predecessor. I'm not offended by that kind of humor (although I don't usually find bathroom humor all that amusing), but it left me feeling the book didn't belong in the same class as BAD CAT.I was glad to see BAD DOG, being a dog lover, but I wish it had been as funny as BAD CAT. I can see where some parents wouldn't want their kids to read this book. Still, there are some funny photos and pages, so it's worth a peek for the adults or older kids."
1,Bad Book,"I will agree, these dogs were definitely overdressed. Almost every dog has on an outfit. 95% of the pages were either bathroom or sex jokes. These just weren't funny. There's even a picture of a dog peeing. Wow, hilarious. Glad I didn't buy this, I read it in the store. The captions aren't funny, the pictures aren't funny. It would be an insult to purchase this for a dog-lover. Unfortunately, since the size and format are the same, it leads one to believe that it's by the same author as Bad Cat, which was hilarious and worth multiple readings. This book is NOT by the same author."
3,Liked Fixed Mix Seeks Same better!,"Although I enjoyed flipping thru this book, my favorite book of this genre is Fixed Mix Seeks Same, which is personal ads ""written"" by dogs. Not only does Fixed Mix... have superior photos, it's really a fun read. Overall, I say the more dog books the better!"
2,"Cute, but not funny.","I bought this and Bad Cats the other day, and I have to say Bad Cats was far better. Bad Dogs is cute, but a little stupid. Almost all of the photos are dogs wearing costumes. Bad Dogs? No, Bad OWNERS. Get Bad Cats instead."
5,great quick workout,"I love this DVD. I had it a couple of years ago, and lost 50 pounds. It got stuck in my DVD player, and I went without for a long time. I bought it again, and it is my favorite workout. I just love it. I am 210 pounds, so I cant do a really long workout yet, but I started back at 227, so I have lost some weight. your whole body will be sore! Even when I got down to 190 last time I had it, I just bought wrist and ankle weights to increase the intensity. Its fun, its a good workout, and its not too long. Its also really cheap!"
2,Beware of running time,"This review is about the VHS edition of The Dain Curse with ""Original Unedited Miniseries"" on the case and in the title listed on Amazon. If you really want the complete miniseries, you need to keep looking -- carefully. The running time for this edition is listed on Amazon (as I write) as 360 minutes. That's six hours. A reviewer states that this miniseries runs 4 hours and forty minutes. On the back of the video cassette case, the running time is given as approximately 192 minutes. However, the actual running time of the tape I received (in a case without shrink wrap but with a proper-looking label on the cassette) was a little over two hours. Even at the length stated on the case, this edition cannot be the complete miniseries if the figure of 4h 40m is correct. And there's no telling where the Amazon figure of six hours comes from. My low rating for this item is due to the unsatisfactory length, not the entertainment value of the movie."
2,$35 support from day one,Purchasers of Word X for Mac should be aware that Micrososft does not warranty their product. I purchased Word X software from Amazon about a month ago and had problems with printing out a document. On seeking help from Microsoft I was told that Microsoft does not warranty Word for Mac and that a minimum thirty-five dollar fee would be required for their help.
5,A must have for all women!,"Sturdy, durable product. Shipped discretely. The handle on this model is longer than most like it, which allows for holding it easier. I purchased this a long time ago and it is still working like a charm. It can take a little careful positioning at first to figure out how to use it best, but once you figure it out, you will be quite satisfied!Thanks"
2,Not enough practical content,I was excited to receive this book however when it arrived i have to say i was a bit disappointed. Like the other viewer states it simply is lacking 'meat and potatoes' . the author quotes alot of other books and it seems every line or two he is giving examples olden day celebrities i have never heard of. i dont care about those people and what they were doing i just want good content i can apply to my charts!
2,Book of quotes from other books,"Too many quotes from other books, it's like a book of sightings from other people. Nothing is written from a personal perspective. Sorry Steven. Not my cup of tea."
4,Amharic usefulness depends on where you are,"Actually I didn't use the book very much, as my surroundings were almost all English or Oromo-speaking. Before spending much time on a learning a language to use in Ethiopia, be sure to check out the location. Since the Amhara's are no longer the dominant tribe, their language may be less useful. Tigrayans are now in power and Oromo are the largest language group."
1,Seventh Cavalry,This is a terrible blurry digital transfer of this forgotten Western classic film. The sound is poor as well and Desert Island Films should withdraw it from the market at once and return any suckered customer's money for this mess. Shame on this film distribution company!
3,You never lose with Randolph Scott!,"Any Western with Randolph Scott will entertain you. 7th calvary is on the talky side, but it still has fun for people who like Westerns. Unfortunately, the only copy available at the time I ordered is of very poor quality, both picture and sound, but I'll have to keep it for the time being. There are still too many Randolph Scott Westerns not available on CD, including some of his best, and this is a shame! Releasing Randy's Westerns could be a great project for Turner Classic Movies!"
3,Not as clever as Ella Minnow Pea......,A fine book but I was disappointed because I was looking for another Ella....
5,"Raw honesty, very healing","This riveting, poetic account of childhood suffering reaches deep into early trauma and abuse. Reading this gripping account will help you access your own childhood memories and heal from abuse. Thank you for the courage to write this book!"
4,Just the facts - from the back cover:,"Enrico (Nicholas Cage), a young soldier stationed in Africa, struggles to survive the consequences of a passionate crime igniting an obsessive search for rescue and redemption. A painful toothache becomes the catalyst for a series of bizarre events when Enrico abandons his camp in search of a dentist, but finds instead a hidden oasis and sanctuary with an exotic young African woman. A brief moment of violent lust gives way to an unexpected bond of friendship, but their passionate encounter comes to an abrupt end when she is mortally wounded one night by one of his stray bullets. Guilt ridden, Enrico covers up his crime only to be confronted with the chilling realization that she may have infected him with leprosy. Haunted by the threat of banishment and fearful he may never be allowed to go home again, Enrico embarks upon a desperate odyssey, searching for the truth in her past and the fate of his future."
5,Little Green Apples,This cd was one of my all time favorites... It still is and I'm so glad I was able to add it to my library.
2,ok for variety,I agree with all the other reviews. The aerobics are even hardto follow for me a long time aerobicsiser. I do however like using theweight segment for a quick diverse workout.
2,Billy Blanks Bites/Tracy York Mambos,"Billy Blanks has nothing constructive or intelligent to say during the entire course of this workout, and the cameraman is obviously enamoured with the girls that Billy surrounded himself with to perform and look pretty. He gives no clear instruction on how to do anything except suck in your stomach and breathe. He also doesn't do equal amounts of repetition on each side, so you're left feeling like you've had an incomplete workout. The editing is HORRIBLE.The aerobics version is okay, but if you count the number of times Tracy says the word ""mambo,"" you will want to die. Better to turn the volume off on this one--best not to buy at all."
2,I'm disappointed Billy!,This tape was a real disappointment to me. As a huge Billy Blanks fan I was expecting more. The filming was very poor and the tape was slow moving and boring. I only made it through it twice. The workout was okay but nothing spectacular. The aerobic segment was impossible for me to follow.
3,IT'S FUN !,"I heard Shaw/Blades plugging an appearance this morning on the Stern Show and they sounded amazing! They were so good, I got goose bumps listening to their harmonies! I definitely bought into what they're doing with this album. I'm a bit disappointed with the studio recordings but I still like the album very much. The live performance just came off so much better. To be honest, the album sounds like it came straight out of the 80's. It sounds just a bit bigger than it should ... know what I mean? I much prefer the stripped down version I heard on the radio.I'm a child of the 80's and a veteran of more than a few Styx and Night Ranger concerts so I'm happy to support these guys and their album. The title boils it down for you. If you have to describe this album in one way ... IT'S FUN!"
1,"Next up, a Pepsi commercial!","Shaw Blades has finally come to terms with their aging creative talent. While not unexpected of Blades. He being of the band that brought you Sister Christian and Rock in America staples of marginal 80's rock. (The B in Blades is for boring) But Shaw is very disappointing. I expected more. He should dump that anchor Jack Blades and find his inner musician again.Forget the Pepsi commercial. Next up, Shaw Blades remakes David Lee Roth!"
3,birth in four cultures,"Birth in Four Cultures : A Crosscultural Investigation of Childbirth in Yucatan, Holland, Sweden, and the United StatesThis is a good book, but not and easy one to read. I expected more about birth in the cultures that the book mentions. About rites and beliefs and I did not found that in this book."
4,Great...but still doesn't sync with Palm!,"Basically like the program - Word is particularly useful in a world where anyone who wants to send or receive a document from you probably already uses it. Entourage is a more usable organizer than the Palm desktop in terms of material you can record in the various tasks, appointments, etc. (Palm's is prettier, but only a bit.) The big problem as of this writing (6/10/02) is that we STILL can't sync Entourage to Palm. As far as I'm concerned, that makes Entourage not-yet-usable, since daily syncing with a Palm is, for me and probably most users, an absolute must! So basically I've bought a word processing program with a convenient but, for the foreseeable future, useless (albeit elegant) desktop organizer. Wish it had a database program, too... in theory, Excel can do that, but it's nowhere near as friendly as Appleworks' database program."
4,a little biased!,"I admit I'm a HUGE peter weller fan so it should be no surprise I loved this movie! One of his most overlooked films,paced terrifically from start to finish.Lori singer shines as his co-star,you won't regret adding this to your collection(plus it's getting harder to find)."
5,4th Graders love to sing out loud in class to it!,"I am a big fan of all of Peter's music for over 10 years now. Since I am a 4th grade teacher and mother of a 3 year old, I had to get Peter's children's CD. I bought it for my kids, but play it for myself. The tunes are original and funny! It amazes me that my 4th graders can pick up the lyrics after one play of the song. (My best friend is a salamander is their favorite.) There are values in the lyrics that I hope my students take with them after listening to the song. ""You shouldn't judge a friend by how he looks or by what he eats"" is a great way to teach respect in my class. I look forward to more children's CD in the future."
3,"Finally, Ashton as a Cop!!","The third in the Carol Ashton series sees the formidable Inspector and her faithful sidekick, Sergeant Bourke, on the trail of a serial killer dubbed the Orange Strangler. In this book, Carol Ashton finally reveals herself to be the highly competent and experienced police officer she is meant to be, as McNab concentrates on the hard slog of policing, rather than on the private life of the Detectoive Inspector. Furthermore, when private interludes are included, they are realistic and almost free of the self-indulgent whining found in McNab's earlier novels. Unfortunately, the solution to this crime is obvious quite early in the piece, and certainly way before the climax. Nevertheless, this is a well written and engrossing book"
3,I want my Optical Out!,"Ok, yes, this player does have a great anti-skip protection...however,I find it hard to justify the cost. . . for a CD player withOUT a digital optical outlet! I mean, come on, this isn't the mid-90's here! We have been able to purchase CD players with this amount of anti-skip protection for a while now, and at much lower prices. So, do yourself a favor, if you are looking for a CD player that will be able to perform up-to-par in the future, then look elsewhere. Also, if you are looking for the same anti-skip protection...you can look to a cheaper model for the same amount."
1,Christian band with Cuss words?,"Christian and cussing just can't mix. These guys write great music. They're lyrics however, even though they are heartfelt, are not christian. I am very dissapointed to find out that this band that I liked decided to change. If your looking for a Christian punk cd, then don't buy this, because squad five-O has changed for the worse."
5,For those who want to know more than facts and figures.,"Without a doubt the best effort by a documentary/film maker tocapture the real essence of the thoughts & feelings of the men ofthe Apollo missions.The documentary is presented composite style, with all missions and recollections presented as one - and the stunning lunarscapes from Apollos 16 and 17 are intertwined with Ed White's Gemini spacewalk, the Apollo 11 landing and Dave Scott's hammer and feather experiment on Apollo 15.The music by Brian Eno and Daniel Lanois enhances the film further and the soundtrack for this film is also worth the purchase."
5,"Humans on the Moon, from the Astronauts Perspective.","We learn about the trials and tribulations of the rushed journey to get Humans on the Moon before the Soviets.As each Astronaut recollects his experience in the Gemini and or Apollo Projects, we are treated to clear film footage, both Color and B+W.Everything is exciting, from the scary spacewalks 300 miles above the Earth by the Gemini Crew to the color film of the Moon Buggy, to the installation of the American Flags on the Moon.The Music by Todd Rundgren enhances the viewing experience.I have watched this DVD quite often and found something new everytime. This is a must see for all, and try to find the flying glove."
1,Misleading description,"Despite the Amazon website describing this BD as region free, it is in fact region 1, and will only play in North America. Purchasers outside North America beware. Don't get caught out as I did."
4,Why?,"I think the original DVD edition has been perfect. Why? Alright, forget it. Sell the DVD and buy the BLU-RAY."
1,fraud,"I am from Europe and I have buy this blu-ray disc because in product details write Region: All Regions, but my Pioneer LX71 blu-ray player dont play this disc. Shame!"
2,Visually splendid but weakly informative,"I absolutely concur with the gentleman who reviewed this DVD on Feb. 28. The footage is outstanding, and I have not seen a majority of it in any other documentary. However, I expected to see some unbelievable documentary about the Apollo program. Instead, the DVD shows what it looks like to go to the moon. This is done by taking various films of different missions and splicing them together though out of context/sequence. Again, this is beautifully done, but it does not tell you anything. This DVD is to be enjoyed if you have a good knowledge of the space program and want to watch some unseen or rare footage. But if you want to learn about the actual space and/or Apollo program, look for documentaries elsewhere. You won't find anything knew in this documentary other then the beautiful visual images."
5,A great buy!,I travel regularly and needed something other than earplugs I could use to quiet the cabin noise. I am so happy with these I would recommend to everyone. The sound is really wonderful and the noise cancelling is remarkable. There is a bit of ear drum pressure from the sound cancelling however you get used to it.
2,Buy the Bose QC-3's instead,"Bought these, tried them at home and was not impressed with the sound quality for being a Sennheiser model. Know that I am a bit of a perfectionist when it comes to sound quality, but I thought the noise-cancelling feature was more of a weak sound boost and the large noise-cancelling microphone was awkwardly placed halfway down the cord.I returned these and went back to the Bose store and purchased the QC-3's, which sound much better (clearer highs and deeper lows), have a more comfortable fit, have a built in noise-canceling microphone and a rechargeable battery. Yes, the Sennheisers are almost 1/3 the price of the Bose set, but if you're serious about sound quality and appreciate well designed functionality, then trust me, just get the Bose set - you won't regret it."
4,it even can teach me,"o.k. I was not raised in Church but i have been a Christian for 5 years, reading the Bible but not really getting it. I bought this book and read it and understanding it all, i took my Bible and look ed up every verse it used to see if it was being used in context and it was.i use it for reference, and im in my 3 rd reading, and i just got 4 more of his books."
1,John's Story,"Was the author trying to emitate The Left Behine Seris? It sure did miss a lot of detail. I can forgive some typos, but this e-book just had way to many."
4,john's story,this book and the others in this series really brings the Gospel to life. it makes it very exciting to think about living at the time it was written and hearing God's word first hand.
5,Love this product,Tweezerman makes the best tweezers. It is defiantly well worth the money and you can't beat the free lifetime sharpening either.
3,Not as good as the full sized Tweezerman,"I don't know what it is with tweezers and scissors, I seem to lose them all over the place. In between ordering this Mini set from Amazon and actually receiving the package, I found one of my full-sized Tweezerman tweezers and have been using that the last few days. (I pluck stray eyebrows every morning while doing my makeup, so they don't get out of hand.) When the Mini arrived just now, I went upstairs to test it out, and unfortunately it just doesn't grip as well as the bigger pair. Several times on fine blonde hairs I had to really fight to get this one to grip it, and after about ten hairs, I went back to the full-sized and got all the stray hairs. So, this is pretty much a waste of my money; by the time I send it back to Amazon, the refund would be minimal, so I guess I'll keep it for emergencies - such as the next time the big pair gets lost!"
3,Not made in Germany,I was disappointed that it is not made in Germany. The quality is just average and i cannot pick and pull very short and fine hair with them.
3,Adorable tweezers,"The cutest tweezers ever, plus the smaller size is really nice, they fit in your hand perfectly. The tweezing is a little more painful than I would like, but they get the job done."
3,Just okay,"I have been wanting to try a mini tweezer and decided to order these after reading the reviews. They work pretty well, but to be honest I have a cheap full size pair of tweezers that grab the shorter hairs better than these do. I am just not sure if they are worth the higher price that I paid for them."
5,Quality,"Lightweight, compact and functional. There are many tweezers on the market but few show the quality and edge of these. They are well worth their price and you wonl't be dissapointed."
1,Not up to par with the full size model,It cuts or breaks hairs making them impossible to remove. I've used the full size model for years and have been very satisfied with it. I guess that I should stick with a known winner.
2,Not sure how I feel.,I ordered this book and it had a nice looking cover on the picture when I placed the order and when I received the book it is just a black cover. I wish it would have said in the listing that there was no cover for this book. I'm hoping it is the right book for my daughters class as I won't be able to find out until she is back at school and already is in need of the book. I picked this store due to its high 100% rating and right now I'm not sure if the rating was right. I think it needs to be disclosed you are buying a book without the cover on it. So I will have to wait and see how the out come turns out for this purchase before I make a final decision on this.
1,Nice if you want to learn tips&tricks and nothing more,"This is 5 stars if you want to learn only tips&tricks; an learn nothing about assembly. After you read this book you know how to write to files in assembly, how to paint a image on the screen....However this 'master class' learn you nearly nothing about assembly programming. It's just a tips&tricks; book. In a tips&tricks; world you don't survive, because your tips will be soon obsolete. You can better learn the ideas behind the tips. You do need to have a great insight in the fundamentals. With fundamentals I mean: how to make and call procedures. How to pass parameters to procedures in assembly, how are instructions processed by the processors etc.If you're looking for fundamentals in low level programming I would recommend 'Assembly Language and Computer Architecture Using C++ and Java' bij Mr. Reis (ISBN 0534405274)."
4,The beauty of Jane Bowles,"I'm in the middle of this book, and I think that it's really well writtenand captures the often volatile and interesting Jane Bowles as goodas her short stories. No one like Jane."
2,SOPHOMORIC FANTASY PRETENDING TO BE SF,"I've read many teenager's fantasies as good as this. The silly, formal and archaic 'fantasy' diction is here all right: ""Yes, Milady,"" etc. etc.So to, is the ridiculous chivalry, the bows, the costumes, the sweet young thing with tresses aglow. Oi.I know every writer has to start somewhere, but must their childish scribblings be published? Must every writer who makes a name for himself go back and sell every word he's ever written, cashing in on his name? Have they no shame?"
3,diagram missing,"Darwin refers to a diagram containing his ideas about evolution, but it is missing from the Kindle version that I downloaded."
3,"Great sound, but design flaw...","Logitech, in my opinion, has the highest quality products around, especially for the price. These headphones sound excellent (as do my logitech speaker systems in my house), and they have very deep base. But they crack in half after about a month or two. I took them back to the store and bought another pair. This time I was especially carefull with them. The new pair cracked again right down the middle. I actually bought the curve headphones for PSP but all of the logitech curve headphones are the same. I am not the only one with this problem, as all of the other curve headphones on this sight have reviews that also say that they break in half. So they sound great, but they will most likely break in half."
1,Complete lack of quality,"Logitech has done it again. They lured me in with something shiney at a low price point and I took the bait, hook line and sinker. These are the worst quality headphones I've owned since my sony walkman replacement fuzzies way back in the early 80s. The sound is small and easily distorted and they are an engineering disaster.These headphones use a clear plastic strap to keep tension on the ears holding the speakers on your head. This is not only seriously uncomfortable but after a week of use, my headphones are completely and cleanly broken in two!Logitech, which used to be, and still is in some unenlightened circles, the industry standard, has removed all quality from their products, and these trendy headphones are a sterling example of this. I could pursue the warranty, but at under $10 I'm just going to call it a wash and lesson learned...again."
5,A stunning first feature,"This is probably Andrei Tarkovsky's most accessible film. It's a solid feature debut that ranks with Francois Truffaut's ""The 400 Blows."" Like Truffaut's masterpiece, ""Ivan's Childhood"" (a.k.a. ""My Name Is Ivan"") is a devastating view of troubled childhood and one of those movies you never forget. I'm delighted that Criterion has rescued this classic from home video oblivion and given it the first class treatment it richly deserves."
1,What about hexane?,"Martek Labs supposedly processes the algae with the toxic, petro-chemical based hexane. Because no residue is left, they don't have to list it, but it's nasty stuff. Read the Cornucopia Institute's report on soy and see the reference to algae-based DHA. I'm trying to find other brands that don't use hexane."
3,Dead Pixels & Poor Space Bar key,"Product had dead pixels, and the space bar key does not enter spaces unless pressed EXACTLY in the middle!HD full of trial software and self promoting programs that need clean up.Lacks Blue Tooth & IR connectivity, or CF card slot (mentioned in Tech Spec, but would have been a nice feature).Otherwise a great system for $1100 or less.Buyer beware...Addendum: Out of warranty, but keyboard fixed gratis by Toshiba. Still a dead pixel, but working great! Added an Adrenaline cache, and the systems flies. Still working great after all these years. Wish I could say the same about HP DV6 series."
3,only one BIG complaint:,"The graphics are good. The play is decent.Although it says that there are THREE casinos to ""visit"", the floor and setup is identical in all three. Seriously idiotic programming. It's not possible to lower the limits on the blackjack tables below $100 min.But mostly: there is this asinine video EVERY time you start up the game. And, if it's not the primary window on your screen, it pauses. Just let the stupid thing run, go make a cup of coffee, it will hopefully be over when you return.I'm not sure this was worth the $12 I paid on eBay for the trio of games. (casino, card, and board.) Surely there must be better casino games available . . ."
4,Excellent inspirational DVD,"This is The Chad Wackerman Trio's first DVD, recorded ""live"" in DrumChannel's LA studio in 2009.Contains mostly tracks from Chad's four solo cd's, released between 1991 and 2004. The firsttwo of these albums featured guitarist Allan Holdsworth, the last two Australian guitarist James Muller.On this DVD, however, the band consists of guitarist Mike Miller (Chick Corea Elektrik Band II,Banned from Utopia) and bassist Doug Lunn (Ed Mann, OutTrio).This is absolutely not an instructional DVD, but rather a performance DVD. Chad talks a bitbetween songs about what inspired that particular tune and so on.The playing is top notch, the sound and camera angles perfect.If you are a fan of any of the above musicians (Miller is featured A LOT), you'll enjoythis! Chad has a couple of featured drum intros to some of the songs, nicely improvisedon his DW/Paiste drumkit.Highly recommended."
4,very touching story,"Very touching and sad story of a very brave man..You just wantto reach out and help this man after his best friend dies..without a doubt the best part of the movie is when Iraaccidently meets his best friend's mother after he is killedand goes over to her and places his head against her, and sheholds him just like she would her son, feeling his pain, just like she knew they had this something in common, a broken heartfrom her son dying and his best friend..a very touching momentin a very touching story"
4,So darn cute!,"This outfit was a favorite. So cute. So comfy. The only thing that was disapointed was how wrinkled the flowers on the shirt were after washing. Totally adorable though, lots of compliments."
3,O.K.,By far not his finest work. Though getting two movies for the price of one compensated for the marginal movies
3,Had to return this seat!!!,"We did so much research and this seat passed all the tests. It's comfy and easy to use.The reason we had to return it was the short crotch strap. My daughter is 2 1/2 and in the 50% for weight (95% for height) and the center buckle dug into her legs. It was just too short. She is tall and thin! When I called customer service, they said that have had ""tons"" of complaints about this, but there was ""nothing they could do."" She said they were ""aware of the problem"" but overall was quite rude about the entire situation. I would not buy this seat unless your child has VERY skinny thighs."
2,Death of a Schulze,"The introduction of digital technology into the hands of Klaus Schulze has led to a musical drought that has lasted almost the entirity of his career (with the exception of the fantastic Dark Side of the Moog series). The huge, spacious, warm, and ethereal sound of his classic period were gone with the introduction of this album, and in their place we find dull, flat instrumentation and painfully cheesy solos. In essense, all the horrid 1980's instrumentation our modern ears have learned to despise are packed into this album, creating a landscape of neon and bad hair. The only listenable track is Death of an Analogue, which comes across like a funeral march, but with an eerie vocoder thrown in. But that's not enough to redeem what is one of Schulze's worst albums."
3,Topeak,"Not have BACKLIGHT...........is very important for me,for the rest is a good product,menu is jerky."
5,Awesome Stories!,"There's nothing like a good ole fairy tale to get a child's imagination going. My kids love hearing these stories and usually there's a lesson in them too. I have a few of Andrew Lang's books, but I plan on getting them all."
3,"Does it's job, but not terribly bright","This flashlight isn't all that bright, and the electric connection is shaky sometimes. I thought the blacklight function would be cool - you know, bleach the blood stains, spray some luminol... what? Anyways, the UV function is even dimmer then the regular, and you need it to be super dark if you want it to work. Buy something with more bulbs if you want to go all CSI on that hotel bathroom (or don't)"
3,An alternative...,"While I do see the need of this device, I think Compaq did us all a dis-service when they offered the PCMCIA/PCCard Expansion Pack at triple the cost. Most of us know that CF memory cards can easily (and inexpensively) be adapted to use in a PC Card slot. There are already wireless LAN products available on PC ard form factor which I would love to use to wirelessly connect to my LAN, be it at home or at work. The PC Card option simply work better. It reduces your total cost of ownership, and it allows you to share some of your existing peripherals with your laptop. If not for the rebate on the CF Expansion Pack rendering it practically free, I would seriouslly consider the PCMCIA Expansion Pack..."
5,My favorite Patricia Barber album.,"I have all of PB's albums and this is my favorite with Cafe Blue a close second. This album was released in 1992 and is often overlooked, Cafe Blue and Modern Cool are usually mentioned when you think of Patricia Barber albums. This album is very smooth sounding and has a late night jazz club easiness that is very relaxing to listen to. My favorite track is ""You Stepped Out Of A Dream"". I also like ""Summertime"" and ""My Girl"" which showcase PB's talent of taking someones elses song and putting a new spin on it. If you are a Patricia Barber fan and like Cafe Blue get this album you will not be sorry."
5,"Youthful, gorgeous, sad","A beautiful first effort from Cuadros, who died shortly before the book was published. Poems and short stories. He writes with anger and nostalgia about growing up in California, learning who his friends were, discovering himself as a gay man, wrestling with AIDS, and keeping people close. A tough book to read, but worth it."
1,Not happy,I thought it was advanced poses. Instead it was some kind of breathing! It was a waste of my money.
4,Best Place to Start with KS,"If you're new to the huge catalog of Herr Schulze this is the CD you need.Long sweeps of electronics with subtle rhythms and - this is what puts Klaus in a class by himself - a real sense of dynamics and build-up.Personally, I think ""Cyborg"", ""X"" and ""Dune"" are his masterpieces, but this is a very fine album and I can't think of a better starting point."
1,"Shirley Horn, ""Here's To Life""",There is only one word for this CD - - -DELICIOUS ! ! ! ! Went back and bought two more for friends. They agreed with me. ENJOY
1,The book is too old for the class requirement.,The book is a hard cover and very old edition. I had to return it to the seller and bought a 9th edition that is required for the course work. I expect a refund of my money even though the seller claimed a 20% of it. There was no indication that the item was that old in the seller's description.
4,Lippincott,"This is a thick book with tons of information. Guaranteed to help out any nursing student or even just a good book to have as a nurse. However, it is hard to navigate this book, it takes some looking around before you can figure it out."
4,change of perception,"Linus Welch was given to me by the author who I met in Rolling Stone magazine. The story follows Linus, his family, his best friend, and a few randomly placed male beacons...men older than him who serve to teach life lessons in mysterious ways. The most interesting man Linus encounters on his weekend long coming of age vacation is his innkeeper, an elderly man with quite a lot of insight. Throughout the book, Linus struggles with social acceptance, educational acceptance, and finally personal acceptance. This book is a must-read."
4,Money as Sacrament-,"This book came to me at the perfect time in my life! I am 43 years old, and on my own for the first time in my life, following the end of a 21 year marriage in which my husband and I played the traditional roles of male/provider and female/homemaker. I was very uneasy and quite frustrated at the financial place I was in. In addition, the topic of money is not one that many of my friends felt comfortable talking with me about, especially now that we were coming from different perspectives.Reading Adele's wonderful book was a blessing to me in 3 ways: it was full of good information and lessons, it changed the way I view money in my life, and I realized that many other women have been in similar, or worse situations, and they have found their way. It really lessened my fears and concerns, and helped me to trust that everything is as it should be. This is a much needed book on a very important topic."
4,Surprising,"Given how old this book is I was surprised who well-done it is. He provides a useful overview of the historiography of the war up to that time, which I found to be quite good."
2,A novel for die-hard Hardy fans and academics,"Ethelberta is not a book I would recommend to most people, and certainly not to someone who has never read Hardy. The novel is tediously written and lacks the depth pervasive in other works set in the country. Only in the last hundred or so pages did the story become engrossing. Why then did I continue reading? Deriving some measure of enjoyment from this book requires that the reader look at it as an example of Hardy's development as an author. The scholarly introduction and notes provide explanations that help with this analysis and make the novel more interesting."
1,Fifty Soups,"Somewhat disappointing. a cookbook without pictures is like a coloring book without crayons. The recipes were redundant, I'm glad it was available at no cost."
5,50 Soups,I love this little book. I also keep this one in my Kindle. I love that I can bring it with me every where I go. It's nice to bring to a friends house as the recipies are easy and Very Good!
4,travel and hunting,"Howard-Bury was typical of the soldier-explorer character in the heyday of the British Empire. Many of these men were of independent means and often took extended leave from their regular employment as soldiers or administrators in the various outposts of British power to travel in areas that caught their interest. HB's career at the time was in India when he decided to explore the Tien Shan. Even today it is a remote area of Kirghizstan; in 1913 it was much more so. The book is interesting not only from a natural history and hunting point of view but also historically. To get to the area that had engaged his curiousity HB had to travel via Russia, and he gives an interesting account of his travels in this tragic country which was soon to experience such catastrophic change in the coming years of war, revolution and Bolshevism. It is a snapshot of a more innocent time, and while not a thrilling adventure, it is absorbing."
1,This is science?,"Psychobabble. For Ms Fisher's theories to have any validity, human brains would have to be hard wired like salamanders. ALL men thinking one way and ALL women thinking another. All human beings are individuals with individual talents and abilities.The idea that women have unique talents in verbal expression flies in the face of history. How would Helen Fisher explain Shakespear, Dostoyevsky, James Joyce, or thousands of other male communicaters? And where IS this evidence of superior female abilities at communication? They don't exist. If there are differences between the male and female brains, it is a difference in style and nuance, not the determanist gulf that she postulates. Every one of her points can be easily be refuted through common experience. Helen Fisher's book is radical feminist agit-prop in the guise of scientific analysis."
5,"Timely, insightful, and well researched.","Fisher's newest book is a well-crafted message of how natural selection has shaped women, and how women's natural talents are already changing, and will continue to change, the way the world does business and the way relationships are conducted. A must read."
1,Disappointing,"I expected more from Helen Fisher. This book was poorly written, and is biased. I think it's fine to acknowledge the differences between men and women,in fact I'd like to see more discussion about this, especially the biological aspects. But why not show how both sexes have strengths and weaknesses, and how they compliment each other? Instead Fisher fills page after page claiming that women are superior at almost every task, and in most cases provides supporting arguments that are weak. Talents of males are mentioned as an afterthought. And of course in the 21st century the supposedly limited skill set of males will no longer be needed. I suppose many female readers will eat this up, but discrimination is discrimination, no matter where it's directed. The prose is quite choppy, kind of surprising, given the innately superior language abilities of women. She must have had a male editor."
1,can you say CREEPY,"Let me say that I had never heard of Diane Arbus before watching this movie. In a nutshell, She meets the stranger living in the attic of her apartment bldg who has a medical condition that makes his appearance that of a werewolf. He is just as creepy as she is. She falls ""madly"" in love with him, takes up photography with the majority of her photos being that of his hallway and front door (yes thats right), neglects her family and becomes weirdly obsessed with her hairy lover. Strange movie. I found it disturbing."
1,Just Terrible,"Nicole Kidman is a brilliant actress, who makes bold choices and doesn't play it safe. I think that's commendable, but the natural result is that for every brilliant movie she's in (The Hours, Moulin Rouge), there's one that's odd (Birth) or just bad (Bewitched).Fur is the worst of them all. Neither Kidman's luminous presence nor Robert Downey Jr.'s talent are enough to save this wreck. Whoever described it as a freak show was being generous.The idea of replacing Diane Arbus's fascinating real life with this ""imaginary portrait"" was a bad one, the screenplay is terrible, and the direction is even worse. I hope Kidman's next project will be better (at least it can't be worse) and more suited to her enormous talent."
2,What's the Point?,"First of all, why make a film that is an ""imaginary portrait"" of Diane Arbus? It consists of a made-up story about Arbus and a neighbor with a medical condition that makes him hairy all over. Kidman, of course, is wonderful, Robert Downey, Jr. is very disappointing, and ultimately the viewer is disappointed too. I suppose Arbus' real life story wasn't interesting enough."
2,In-fur-iating,This movie is really quite unfortunate. Diane Arbus was a fascinating woman and her life should have gotten the treatment it deserved. They had been debating for years about how best to approach this... what won out was probably the worst idea. It is fictional and only loosely based on her amazing life. It is pretty insulting to her memory. The fictional allegorical love affair with her upstairs neighbor is kind of insulting for it portrays her as a naive woman needing a masculine figure to bring out her artistic notions. The character itself pays homage to Lionel the Lion-Faced man and imagines a meeting/romance. They even change her kid's names for no reason. I hope another film does it right.
3,A Disappointment,"This item was purchased for a boy who loves Cars 2 but it did not say that you have to have a special system to play this. So it has not been used,. A big disappointment."
3,Not as good as I thought it would be.,"It was an okay book, but I had a hard time getting through it. I felt like I was slogging through mud going nowhere fast hoping that the book would pick up pace, but it didn't seem to. I think it was mainly because it seemed as though none of the characters were ever truly happy. It's not like it was a tear-jerker or anything, but it was one upheaval/disappointment/tragedy/issue after another. In the end, all the characters kind of settled back down to live with the decisions they had made, but when the book ended, it still felt as though it would take many months (or even longer) for people to get their lives back on track and regain even some semblence of complacency."
2,Very disappointing,I cannot see what would make anyone want to read this book. The characters are so self centered and shallow. The casualness with which the characters drop into bed with one another and their total lack of regard for how their actions impact on others disgust me. I hope never to meet characters like this in real life. I doubt serioulsy if I'll spend the time to read any other of Trollope's books.
3,Where's the power cord?,"Being able to synchronize the iPAQ at the office is incredibly convenient. The device installs easily into Windows 2000. However, where's the power cord? It would really be nice if the device could get recharged at the office, too. If you use just the iPAQ, it's probably not that big of a deal, but with additional accessories installed [modem, wireless LAN connection, etc.] the power starts to drain. Just a thought."
4,good read,great book about magic and religion. the first type of book i've read quite like it. very fascinating book to read.
5,Impressive,"Finally, a book of magical study that does not involve ritual circles. I also appreciated the in-depth historical account, though some of it was a little silly. For instance, one part mentioned that women involved in bulb gathering were not to gather bulbs during their unclean period lest there be a bulb shortage.Actually, compared to Green Magic, this is at least real, so I ought to a least give this a positive rating. It does tell decent history on the development of magic, and in the history itself it tells brief customs and also some examples of magic itself. Besides, one of the people rating Green Magic tried to get people not to vote for me."
5,A new sound!,"It's clear that this doesn't have the signature E-street sound, but that's what sets it apart. I appreciate their sound. And since I didn't listen to this as a 9/11 CD, I can enjoy the music in another way. It doesn't have to be 9/11.Knowing only the popular tunes, The Rising, City of Ruins, Lonesome Day, I was surprised that there was some nice songs here, some with a hard rock sound and some really nice ballads. This is a real treat!.....Rizzo"
3,Bruce's Return to Mediocrity,"Well, I know I'll get some flack for this, but I can't get too worked up about this album. Yeah, yeah, I know it's an album about the aftermath of 9/11, but that doesn't automaticly mean that it's any good. At worst, the album sounds like leftover John Mellencamp. It doesn't have the ""signature"" E-Street sound, and while that isn't necessary all the time, I think in this case it might've helped. It's not a terrible album by any means. ""Mary's Place"" is a fun little rocker, and ""Lonesome Day"" kicks off the album nicely. But, the constant repeated imagery of ""one more kiss from your lips"" (Where else did you want a kiss from, considering this image is used three times) and ""may your strength give me strength"" gets overbearing and silly after a while. Still, the haunting ""My City Of Ruins"" almost makes it worth while. But almost doesn't count as much as it used to these days."
5,A joy to read,"Sandburg took criticism for filling in some blanks with his imagination, but so what? His biography of Lincoln was not intended as a scholarly treatise. Think of the mystic atmosphere of a campfire at night, with an elder telling about the greatest person in a tribe's history. That is Sandburg's accomplishment, making Lincoln live again among us, at least while we are surrounded by Sandburg's mesmerizing account. No one interested in Lincoln or in the meaning of America should miss the experience of these volumes."
4,A good book for intermediate users,"I think that the reviewer that trashed this book because it doesn't have pretty pictures is misguided and just plain foolish. This is not a book for beginners, and its point is not to act as a showcase for pretty pictures. If you're an intermediate to advanced user, and want to see how different tasks are accomplished within Maya, then definitely check this book out. Read the tutorials that interest you first, and see how the author uses different tools to get the job done. But don't stop at the tutorials. Use what he presents and integerate it into your own workflow and build on the info in your own way. The reason I gave this book a 4 and not a 5 is because it only has 30 tutorials - if you have an insatiable appetite for anything Maya, 30 tuitorials leaves you hungry for more."
3,"Some useful information , examples are dead boring though.","My only real beef with this book is the poly modelling examples are pretty dull although they've been designed to introduce you to all the features of maya, there's a good section on paint effects and use of constraints / dynamics. This will teach you a lot , I think you'd learn a lot more from the Mastering Maya 3.0 book though , even if you've only v.4.0."
3,"not realy for mid to expi users, more for begginers","... so I use Maya from v1. And I hoped that this book will give me different aproach to solving some more complex situations. Modeling section is quite unnecesary (no tips and tricks there). All in all exelent book for beginers, but nothing more. Expierienced user, or one who like to dig into maya will find litle or no use of this book since one probabily came to all these solutions on it's own. Everybody else should buy this book. It might show you the way to go into maya real powers. Also I think the book is litle streched and some renderings are added just too fill space and make book thicker.On a second tought worst thing about this book is statment that is intended for mid. to exp. users. It's exelent book for beginers. If you are one buy the book! Now!"
3,Exploring Maya 4: 30 Studies in 3D,"The lessons in this book are not for a user unfamiliar with the Maya interface. The author skips any direction on where to find menu items, or how to create objects in his tutorials, assuming the reader has used Maya frequently (I think these lessons are from tutorials he presented to his Maya students at his school).Other than that, the lessons are useful if you know Maya and want to learn how to do a variety of things you probably have never done before.The cd has some nice animation samples on it too."
3,Not for those who can't sing,If you are looking for a CD to sing-along to I don't recommend this product. The first couple of lines are sung for/with you but then stop... and for those who can't carry a tune it is difficult to continue singing. My nieces did enjoy the variety of Christmas songs.
1,Software and Support needs work,"While the techniques advocated by Princeton Review are very helpful, the software is not. After three hours on hold with their support, the tests still freeze up and cannot be scored. Without this software, the book is grossly overpriced."
2,Book is fine - CD-ROM crashes my computer!,"The book is fine - does everythign you need a GRE-prep book to do. But the CD-ROM practice tests have a nasty habit of freezing up the computer everytime I don't finish a test in the alloted time. I don't get my score, and I have to reboot the computer. This makes me pretty unhappy."
4,It's a Garage Door Opener,"So easy to install, even I could do it! However, it's just a garage door opener and it opens the garage door when you hit the button. What else can you say about it?"
3,Sniffers LifeStages,My dogs loved the old Sniffers that are no longer available. Thought we give the new ones a try. They were only ok. The dogs still liked them but they were crazy for the old ones.
4,It's Working,"It's not that I wanted to buy this book, but the math class i'm in dictated that I must have it. I must admit the book is informative and well narrated. As it goes i'm pleased."
4,Great price,"Although it's the teacher's addition it actually work better for my benefit, it has all the odd and even answers in the back. It doesn't come with the solution book but that's fine with me for the price i'm giving. Overall it's worth my money"
2,There are better books out there...,"I got this for a horse production class and was very unimpressed. I've worked in the horse industry for several years, have my own library of horse books and have since I was a little kid. The book is vague, filled with inaccuracies, and doesn't hold much appeal. People would be better, especially for a learning environment, to go with some of the more modern non-textbooks out there. I currently am taking Equine Studies classes that actually are featuring books from public circles and have found them far more informative and easy to follow. If you are thinking about this book for your class or just to learn about horses: don't. There are far better books out there that are actually up to date, clear, and concise... not to mention nicer to look at."
1,Help for NT users,"heres is what I am currently doing to get by until serial cables come out...On your NT computer - click import/export, select export to a file (select *.PST type) and then select what you want to transfer (check all subfolders)click next and save the file, and then transfer the file somehow (I use the internet) to your home PC and then Import that file into your Outlook 2000 at home.then sync and presto you have your information.It sucks to have to do that but until the serial cradles arrive plus beware if you do all the files in outlook (calendar/inbox )ect. the file could get huge 3 to 4 megs"
2,"Very good, but didn't last long enough","It served us well. Did its job. But after about 5 years, with very few times used, and not too many times needing to be charged from AC current, it would no longer charge up from an AC chord.It seems to me that if a car battery can last many years, with continuous use, this should last a lot more than 5 years.Schumacher PS-120A Mity-Mite Jump Starter Charger"
2,"Barely OK, moving toward don't buy","It worked fine for about 2 years, starting my Ford Ranger approximately 10-12 times, then just went south and wouldn't hold a charge. Same as some other reviewers here. For the money it is not a good value."
2,Poor product,I have had 2 faulty units right out of the box. The first would not hold a charge for more than a couple of days and that did not improve after cycling the battery a number of times. I returned it for a replacement and that 2nd unit never indicated a full charge - even after being on charge for several days. I am moving on to another brand.Don't waste your time and money on these poor quality items.
2,Great Material but the Price?!,"No way is this book worth the money being asked for it. People are trying to capitalize on the nostalgia players have for this excellent and out of print RPG. Yes the books are getting tough to find and Pooka happens to be a rare one. That doesn't mean a buyer should have to rationalize dishing out over $50 for this paperback that's less than what? 60 pages? I saw here on Amazon someone is asking for almost $300. I can appreciate being a collector but that kind of price tag is pure comedy. My personal recommendation is search for this book for under $30 at MOST. As an owner of this book, I can vouch that it's as fun and nifty to have as you might think, but it's not worth most of your paycheck."
5,You're nuts if you don't have this book in your library!,"One of the finest books on Hollywood's master photographer, George Hurrell. The author not only is an expert in his own right, but he knew Hurrell. That special blend along with the fact the author knows how to write and chose some wonderful never seen before photos makes this book one very satisfying bedtime meal. Great reading"
4,"Full of good information, but a bit dated","I bought this book as a gift for a neighbor child who enjoys watching birds at the feeder between our houses. When it arrived from Amazon, I skimmed through it, and had mixed feelings. The stories are wonderful to read as an adult but seem a bit dated, and, while still an enjoyable read, may be less than engaging for many children. The illustrations are fairly interpretive and rendered in black and white, so the book doesn't function as any kind of quick reference. But as a learning tool for increasing a child's acquaintance with familiar backyard birds, it's very good. Paired with a good quick-reference field guide or chart, this could make for many happy hours of satisfied bird-watching."
4,Terrific but expensive and brittle,Not only does this glass work great for sake but it also is nice for beer or drinking water. The Riedel name means this will be expensive. Be very careful washing this glass as it can be easily shattered.
3,Metheny's shortest album,"I remember being slightly disappointed when this album was released, and it wasn't just the LP's 35-minute playing time. Its predecessor, the ground-breaking 'Pat Metheny Group', had made such an impact on me. I believe Pat was still feeling his way at the time, sounding out his audience to see what they really liked.Strangely, this album has quite a prog-rock feel to it. Parts are almost Yes-like. Howe and Wakeman from the 'Topographic Oceans' era could sound very similar to parts of this. The whole thing has a strong American mid-western, open-air flavour -- it's quite unECM-ish.This was bassist Mark Egan's last album with the band, and it paved the way for Metheny's first masterpiece, 'Offramp'."
5,Uplifting story on being bipolar from one who's been there,"While most people try to forget a painful past, Faye has done a great service in sharing hers with us in her book. It took a lot of courage to delve back into the pain and humiliation brought on by her illness. In doing so Faye gives hope to others who have to deal with this disease. Her proactive approach in dealing with being Manic/Depressive is beneficial as well as her on-going work getting information out on the disease. She is one determined crusader who is helping remove the stigma of mental illness and letting people know they aren't alone in fighting this disease."
4,"Perfect size, not as easy to keep clean","I love the way this sink looks and the size is perfect because I have a very small kitchen and did not want a full-size sink. Plus, I love the idea that the swanstone is a green alternative for material. However, the swanstone gets dirty very easily, so i feel like i'm constantly having to scrub off scuffs and discoloration. So far, I've been able to get all the marks out, which is a plus, but I've only had the sink for a few weeks now. The price was very reasonable too."
4,Small sink,Smaller than I expectedI did not allow for the necessary lipalso a little dull looking in this bone color.template was worthlessVery solid made
5,The Blind Boys Go Urban Contemporary Gospel,"This album, (and thats what they called music on long playing disc back in the day)... was the Blind Boys first venture into the world of contemporary Gospel. Gamble & Huff gave it there Phili International sound. Clearance Fountain, and Sam Butler worked well together and young gospel programers during that time gave some on-air time for this quartet The Five Blind Boys Of Alabama's ""I'm A Soldier In The Army""..this is history, and for the first time it is on c.d. (compact disc)thanks to the legendary team of Gamble & Huff,with Messiah Records own Tony Beck and ... and then came ""The Gospel At Colonus"" produced by Bob Telson...pull this one up at c.d. now..."
3,Bike Light,"Worth the money, but mainly to give indication to other cars that you're on the road. The front white light is ok, not bright enough to really guide where you are going exactly."
4,Top-notch American cozy,"I'm a big fan of armchair-type mysteries, as well as novels about political intrigue. And this one is about as good as it gets. Margaret Truman was the daughter of a President, so of course she has a firm grasp of the culture of Washington's movers and shakers. And she can spin a captivating and well-constructed yarn with the best of them. The main character here is a newspaper reporter who has had the bad luck (or bad judgment) to cross some of Washington's most powerful people. Now his efforts to unravel the murder of the young daughter of another Washington figure threaten to make him even more unpopular with the Establishment. Truman plays fair with the reader all the way, never tipping her hand, and the mystery comes to a completely satisfying ending (although, as in all mysteries, the killer is never the guy you WANT it to be!). Fans of cozy mysteries or political intrigue novels can't do better than this one."
3,a so-so collection...,"...although I may be biased because I don't agree theoretically with some of ego psychology's key concepts (what's a conflict-free ego sphere? Why all the hydraulics of ""neutralization""? Why the huge emphasis on the ego to begin with?). Rather technical."
5,Just what I wanted,Delightful stickers. Needed them to enhance some name badges. Did exactly what I had hoped. Great detail. Great images. Thanks
3,Interesting book,"The book is very interesting, but the paperback book was so old, it was practically dust and was falling apart!!!"
3,LID Problems,"Toy box is fine but the lid is another story. I went to the store to see this item in person and was very disappointed. The lid sits poorly on top of sandbox, offers little to no protection. Get another sandbox for your child!!!"
5,"Loved this book, very inspiring",Reading this book was extremely interesting for me. I was inspired by this genius woman.
2,Material is very thin,"Material is too thin to look nice. When the sun is shining, you can't even see the design. Seems to be nicely constructed otherwise, but just doesn't look that nice."
4,"Cute, but not the stated size",This is a cute curtain although it is an orange/pink rather than the pink it shows in the picture. My problem with it was that in the description it is supposed to be 84 inches long and it is only 55 inches long. Now I have to order a second one so that it will be long enough to cover my window. It does look nice in the window though.
4,Synchs as it should but no power,The USB cable synchs your iPaq as you would expect it to do. It does NOT charge your iPaq though so you'll still need either the cradle or the auto (car) charger for that. So don't think you can grab just the USB Sync cable and off you go. They should offer a simple plug charger along the same lines as this Sync cable.
5,Compact Sync Solution,"The thin USB sync adapter cable makes synchronizing on the road or when using multiple computers a snap. I've used the cable to sync with my desktop at work, my laptop when on the road and with any other computer when travelling. Very light and simple to use I'd recommend it to anyone who has more than one computer."
1,worst strings I've ever owned in over 40 years of playing,I bought 4 sets of these. The wound 3rd string broke on every set in a short time. One 1st string broke when I was stretching it.
5,WHAT'S AN EXCELLENT JOB!,"I went over your book (The Basic Oxford Picture Ddictionary English/Haitian Creole) last week; I found it very interesting. As an Adults School teacher, I found it very helpful special for people who don't know yet how to look for words in the regular dictionary. I have decided to use that book in my school to help my students. Now, I would like know what will be my rebate if I buy 30 of them."
5,+Very Very Good+,This is the fourth time i have read this book & i'm only 12 years old! In short I loved this book! the plot was intresting ( enjoyed the political aspects ) & the charecters were ppl i'd want for friends. I wish to know more of Tal's background.
5,space opera to die for,"This is the best science fiction novel I've ever read.Other reviewers have alluded disparagingly to the plot(s), but (originality aside) I can't think of any other book that balances so much, so effortlessly. Let's face it, THE PLOTS ROCK.Then there's the characters. I've never felt so fond of or close to characters in a book before. In such a plot-happy book, the amazing thing is that it's the characters that come back to me, day after day.I can't get this book out of my head! I love this book. Did I say that already?"
4,Highly recommended,"The Star Wars audio books are always extremely satisfying, adding voices, music, and sound effects into the book to create an experience highly reminiscent of the old radio shows.While you lack the visual aesthetic of the original comic, you'll find so much more inside this audio adaptation. Recommended for all Star Wars fans, whether you read the comic or not."
2,Not was I was hoping for,"Please take this review with a grain of salt, as it's been years since I heard it, but when I bought this album back in the 70's(on the strength of a cool cover and a title which promised pounding music), I was very disappointed. I'm not saying that this is a bad album, simply that it is marketed as a heavy metal album, and it's not. It's a pop record. There is nothing remotely heavy about this record, unless your idea of heavy is Boston with less distortion. If very light rock is your thing, it may be something to check out, but don't be fooled by the title or the cover. Trust me, this wasn't even heavy by 70's standards."
2,Not impressed.,"I bought this software for my son, who is a Lego fanatic. His favorite is the Legoland software, where you build your own amusement park. This seems great until you try to play it for awhile and it keeps telling you that you are low on items. Even after you add everything it still dumps you out so you have to start again. Very frustrating for a kid or adult! We haven't played the chess game yet, but the others are far from being the best games on the market."
5,If you've ever wondered what's on the other side..,Death & BeyondIt's a subject that many people don't want to think about or they don't know what to think about it. What happens to us after we transition at death? This program discusses a lot of information from research & personal accounts. There are also guided meditations to make us more comfortable surrounding the inevitable. I found it to be informative & reassuring.
1,very poor quality,I purchased this item a few months ago and just took it out of the box for my daughter born the end of November...well all the padding has completely broken down and flaked all over!!!! I now have a complaint against combi pending and now must purchase a new seat because i will not put her in this one!!!!!!!!!do not purchase!!!!! who only knows what the material is made of( it was made in Italy)less then 1 star
2,Difficult to work with,Typing is very difficult on this keyboard. You often have to stop and rehit a letter many times to get it to be recognized. Touch typing is out of the question.
4,Good product that needs a little work,"This keyboard is a real trooper. It has been through backpacks, boxes and just jammed into things and still keeps going. It is great for taking along on troubleshooting. Only two real issues with it. First, you have to be very deliberate about pushing the keys. You have to press it firmly and in the center of the key for it to register. This could be trouble for fast typers, but you get used to it after a while. The other issue is that there is no way to tell if the Caps Lock or Num Lock are on. It would have been nice to have some LEDs, and the markings on the side indicate that maybe I got a model that just didn't have them. Other than that, this is a great little backup keyboard. I would recommend it for techies to add to their travel pack."
2,Quality is not there. You get what you pay off,It's not very soft......but got a great deal so I'm keeping it....sorry this is not much of a review... I can't rave about it..but at the same time I don't hate it. The frech blue color is very pretty...but the quality of the towels are that great for me to love!
1,"Very weak, don't bother","Just about the weakest biography of anyone I've ever read - poorly written with little insight into the subject's character, this is a book that appears to have been thrown together with no care and little effort. An insult to the reader.For a good read on Martha Gellhorn, try Caroline Moorehead's Gellhorn: A Twentieth Century Life - a much more in-depth look at the subject and a superior quality of writing. Ms Moorehead is clearly a writer who knows her stuff. (Check out her latest, Human Cargo, for a powerful work on refugees)."
5,Great for Beginners,"This dvd is great and it's approachable by almost anyone. What I like is that he gives you options or ""adjustments"" on each pose so it suits where your body happens to be at...the pace is steady and i broke a sweat. What I also like is that it is straightforward yoga and easy to pick up... He also has a soothing voice which is always a help especially during the cool down/ meditation period of the dvd. I liked it and so will you."
3,"Fine production, a bit too long","This show features terrific actors, gorgeous production values, but runs a little long. The direction and editing are not quite up to the level of some other entries in the series. I'd nonetheless recommend it to anyone interested in this fine television series."
2,Just got it,I just got this phone last week from Cingular. I got it for $29.99 which I thought was a good price. I don't care much for Cingular. I am an old AT&T customer. I don't always get my messages on it. I have tried to register it with AOL mobile and I still have not gotten my confrim message yet. I don't like the side buttons I am always hitting them. Otherwise I like it so far.
2,I hate this phone!,"I have owned this phone about a month and I've had to take it back to the store 2 times already. The first time the phone ""pretended"" like it was charging but remained only @ 1 bar after charging for 12+ hrs. The second time the phone would drop my calls after about 3sec. of talking. The phone is very small and cute and the ringtones sound really good, but that's about the only thing redeemable about the phone."
1,God-awful phone,"I don't need my cell phone to take pictures, play music, access the internet, or do my taxes for me. I just want it to work. I just want to be able to hear the person I'm talking to and function as a phone. That's it. This phone fails even that basic test. Stay away from it. It will turn your hair gray."
5,Amazing Cam,"After reading some reviews, I wanted to go with the 3Com camera, but didn't have the money so I chose Intel. The software installed fine, the cam installed fine. Works great on my P166 with 64ram, Quality is great, the software is awesome, it has some games you play using the cam, like virtual basketball, that's really cool. The camera is fast too, I've had a camera before and it slowed the whole PC down. Also there is a $30 rebate if you order it before September 30, 2000 (mail it by October 30, 2000), so for the price of the standard Intel camera, you can get the pro."
3,Pigs at the Trough,Pigs at the Trough is a fantastic look into corporate greed. Not only does the book expose the unfair buisness practices of crooked CEOs but also the great gap between them and thier workers. The book explains that what happens upstairs at a large corporation is much different. Huffington shows how the upper one percent of the world is getting away with murder and still making more than the lower eighty percent of the entire world.Overall Pigs at the Trough was an excellent read. You will find yourself repulsed by the leaders of Walmart and Tyco but at the same time will not be able to put it down. Inform yourself and read this book.
3,good read but not as invigorating as I expected,"Enjoying Huffington's columns, I figured I would really find this book one that I couldn't put down, however it failed to live up to my expectations.The book is 'chock full of facts which are oftentimes very outrageous and raise blood pressure just to discover. Unfortunately, more often than not, Huffington skips a few steps in building the reader up to outrage and how she reached her conclusions weren't obvious and consequently I wasn't as riled up as I felt like I should be.Other reviewers have commented on the introduction of lots of Ariannaisms that are distracting and they're definately there,but I think that's part of the charm of one of her books.While I wouldn't point someone at this book to try to sway them to Huffington's views, if you're inclined to agree with everything she's saying, I find this to be a worthwhile read, just one with entered into with the correct expectations..."
2,"too little details, too much sarcasm","First of all, 20% of the words in this book seem to be devoted to sarcasm- it was funny at first but then became tiresome. The book follows the pattern of telling you what's wrong, who's guilty, and how much money that person sucked from the American taxpayer. Personally I'm more interested in the details of the loopholes. How do offshore tax havens work? How do corporate lobbyists operate in Washington? These details aren't available in Pigs at the Trough."
5,Excellent Condition,"The product was delivered in excellent condition, in a timely manner and at a great price. Highly recommend."
1,The previous reviwer is entirely correct,"The contents of this book are unedited garbage. And the reason is....Books published by General Books LLC are put together using an OCR automated scanning device which can miss complete pages. Typos are frequent and there's no table of contents. There is ABSOLUTELY NO EDITING of the book and the scanning is done by a robot (probably the reason half the book is on Wimax - the robot picked up something else as well).This is all stated on the publishers web site (google them and read - you'll be as shocked as I was when you get all the details). The owner of General Books LLC, VDM Publishing, is notorious for these ripoffs - almost every review of their books (around 500,000 of them from one imprint or another now listed on Amazon) by an actual buyer is negative, many are extremely so.If you have bought the version from General Books LLC by mistake, you can return to Amazon within 30 days(but check Amazon's Return Policy for the details)"
2,Great Book--just don't buy this edition,"This is a great book and would rate 4-5 stars. However, this version is a 'print on demand' type reprint. The quality of paper is good but the font is very small AND the text is pushed together: there is not much space between lines and there is NO spacing between chapters (where usually it would start on new page). The end result is a great book that is hard to read."
2,"A good catalyst for discussion, but a dry, flat style","Our high school read this book for our Summer Reading Program. Most students and faculty agreed that the book raised excellent questions for discussion, but the dry, flat style of the writing made it very difficult to read. After falling asleep several times trying to read this at night, I finally forced myself to read it early in the morning. Bellamy spends much of the novel explaining how this socialist utopia functions, providing detailed analysis of the economy, government, education, and other institutions. I would recommend this book to readers interested in discussing political issues, but not for readers who need a strong plot or dynamic characters."
2,Obama Blueprint?,"I happened across this book while reading ""the politically incorrect guide to the 60's"".It was noted as a utopian fantasy where the government solves all problems, spreads the wealth around, and all corporations and capitalists are evil.Classic Marxism and typical liberal fantasy!"
2,This book really isn't worth the money.,"I am not a big fan of this book. If you subscribe to ""The Autograph Collector"" magazine, you would know that 80% of the magazine is advertisements, and you would think spending [money] on a book you wouldn't have 25 pages of ads. Also, many of the signatures in this book do not match signatures I have received in person. In stead of the ad's they should have used that extra 25 pages to list more examples of stars signatures, or at least list more people. I would suggest that they make the signatures themselves smaller, as many people are copying the signatures out of the book onto index cards and photos, and selling the forgeries on ebay. All together, I would suggest you buy a different book; this one is not even worth what you would pay for it used."
2,Devil Bat,"this dvd movie get grainy ,is not totally restored,i know is an oldest movie but get a lot grainy not like thy others oldest movies."
3,Lugosi Reigns!,"Running a mere 68 minutes, ""The Devil Bat"" remains a classic among poverty-row chillers. Bela Lugosi's sinister presence and memorable one-liners - such as the immortal ""bombastic ignoramus"" - outshine the clumsy special effects. The above-average supporting cast includes Dave (""Reefer Madness"") O'Brien and Arthur Q. Bryan (the voice of Elmer Fudd). Released by the Lugosi Estate, the DVD offers an excellent 35mm print and plenty of extras. Watch it if you dare!"
3,Robin Hood: Most UNWanted,"Robin Hood had very bad animation, (Prince John always has a different number of rings on his hands, changing from minute to minute)and a little bad humor. The voices used were very good, but not a movie I'd recommend for anyone who values thier money. Good for ages 1-4."
3,Movie is Great But is Disney pumping the well Dry?,"I think the use of a special edition for this DVD is a strecth... I doubt we even get the original trailers or a re-issue one for the film. No sign of a making of... anythign cool like that.. we will prob get a bunch of silly ""child"" games which are filler and a waste of time. They should use that for a making of. I hope the 1.33:1 full frame for this film is the theatrical aspect ratio for this film. Rescuers has it at 1.66:1 so we may be getting conned with this release and the re-issue of the Fox and the Hound."
1,not right,it was not what it was suppose to be we had got something else next time they need to be be specific about what the item is it was not the disney robin hood it was something totally different.
5,"fresh,brilliant and creative",His first jazz album(i believe) but you'd never believe it. This music is confidently creative and very listenable jazz....every Metheny fan should have it.
5,shimmery....fresh feeling,I had used Revlon Skinlights Instant Skin Brightener in the past... LOVED it... couldn't find it in any stores anymore so went on line... was THRILLED that I could still get it... Love it....ordered three !!! :)
3,colors aren't great,"i haven't been too impressed. it's too waxy for my face, and the color is WAY too pink. i won't repurchase..."
4,"Bulky, but very useful","Until the recent release of low power CF wireless lan cards, this was your only option for going mobile with you iPaq Pocket PC. I've used the sleeve extensively with a Cisco Aironet 340 WLAN card and it works great. Want to go wide area? Slap in a Seirra Wireless Aircard and truely go mobile.While the sleeve is a bit bulky, the heft definately is out weighed by the usefulness. With new Pocket PC 2002 iPaq's (or the pending upgrade from Compaq for current owners), you can use VPN features while away from the office. The nice thing is Compaq seems very commited to the current form factor, meaning that even if you buy a new iPaq, the sleeve will still work for some time to come."
3,A secret society that isn't secret.,"This movie could have expanded so well in some many different areas. Covering in far more detail how the society operated, the benifits and a whole lot else. But it chose to be very ambiguous.There is no hero of the film as the main character is manipulated from the very begining of the film to the very last line.For a secret society alot of people knew of its excistence.After watching it I felt that there was more to be told, more to have experienced from the film. It just didn't go the extra mile.However all that being the case, it is an enjoyable film to watch. Not one that I would want to own, but I am happy to have seen it. Rent it rather than buy."
2,Has Charlie from Mighty Ducks,"When I rented this movie, from a friend's suggestion (he said he liked it in the seventh grade so at 26, I should like it too) I dind't really know what I was going to get. Little did I know I was going to get Charlie from the Mighty Ducks. While he's not the lovable winner from the show about ice hockey, he's still the good guy and good guys win (SPOILER ALERT)."
3,I am now a Joshua Jackson Fan. (dammit),"I Expected Garbage, what I received was a very good movie. Sure, It takes itself a little serious, and the plot twists can be a little on the unbelievable side, but i leave the complaining to the Critics. The Actors, young and old, are Above Average. Rob Cohen's Direction is Heavy-Handed and a little on the Overly- Serious side, but still better than alot in this Genre. In fact, that what probably lifts this film and makes it better than the material, they hired a seasoned film director (who knows how to hold a shot for more than 10 seconds) instead of a 20 year old Music Video director (all flash and no substance, good for some films but not for this genre). Being that I expected Garbage has alot to do with my enjoyment level, if I had went in expecting something great, I probably wouldn't be so leanient."
4,"Good Movie, Excellent Thriller",I really liked this movie mostly because of the story line. Its kinda the government consperiecy idea taken on a Collage world. If you like mysteries/thrillers youll really enjoy this movie.
1,Agh! Another dire Hollywood movie!,"This is a very bad film... It is nicely shot, and the set location is good, but the plot (college kid outsmarts global super-powerful secret society) is just terrible. It's one of those films where you actually hope there isn't a happy ending (we can wish, can't we?!)"
2,Poorly plotted and pictured and definentely not worth it.,"The movie has a good story, but they messed it up with their begginig and silly end. It's definetely NOT worth it."
3,Great trash,"This film is great, trashy fun. Of course, it's impossible to take it seriously. Inspired supposedly by Yale's Skulls and Bones, the movie has such incredible, unbelievable situations, that to enjoy it one has to see it as an unintentional comedy. My best scene in that sense would be when Joshua Jackson is interned by the baddies in a madhouse. It's such a ridiculous scene that you can't help laughing at it. The second-best situation would be the duel, and the father, telling his son after being shot the immortal line ""You're not worth the trouble"". Take it easy and laugh out loud."
3,Is This Supposed To Be Horror Or What?,"I don't get this movie. The story is more than predictable - and still, it is very talentlessly told! And above all, the character descriptions are very very very poor. In brief, The Skulls has no structure at all and leaves me wonder if the makers have cooperated at all, or if they've just quarrelled from the very first shooting day.The third star is for the exciting scenes that it - after all- does provide! But in general, this is really a waste of time."
3,Fiction about the real Skull and Bones Yale secret society,"With both the Bush presidents being members the Skull and Bones of Yaleare not so secret now as they were in the past.The frightening implications of vast wealth being put behind ""chosen"" individuals in order to make them successfulmay be somewhat exaggerated in this movie, but the result is stillnot what one would call as democratic type organization?Here the hero is a poor boy who on merit of his being a leading oarsman on the winning Yale team is nominated for the Skulls.His partner is the president's son and his room mate causes some real trouble in his death in uncertain circumstances.His girl friend is forced by the problems and trouble to come to his aid in the crisis that follows.I thought it was an interesting film that made one wonder aboutthe real secret political and economic structures in American society."
1,Thai Fresh Lemongrass - 8 stalks,"Exactly what I wanted, will reorder when I run out. Came fresh and makes the best tea. Thank you very much.."
4,Buen libro,"Un excelente libro para poder enseñar a hablar o a leer el idioma español con facilidad, se puede interpretar facilmente."
3,I little bit disappointing...,"Got this at Amoebia just now, and listening to it on the headphones...Disco Rick is pretty angry and profane, with some hardcore rips on wack rappers (Kid N Play, etc)...Musically, he's got a good portion of electro / miami bass on this LP, along with some wac RnB stuff (""Girl Let Me Lick You"").Best song is Wiggle Wiggle Wiggle, although if you can find a remix on Luke's ""Bass Hits From Da Bottom"" Vol 1 you'd be better off."
5,Best FRS !,"Excellent radio, much better than Motorola. Easy to use and very good reception. With the rebate it's a real bargain too. Go buy a pair today, you won't be disappointed!"
3,Explained: how a minor writer still survives.,"Susan Manning's introduction is a model of its kind, situating Irving in his cultural and historical milieu. Exposed like this, Irving cannot help looking like a minor writer, whose eminence largely derives from his being the first, rather than the best.The interest of a story like 'Sleepy Hollow', though, is less in its anguishing over American possibility and European tradition, than its excellence as a ghost story. The atmosphere in the story, caught through nature description, suggestion, and the careful build up of stories, rumours and hints, is compellingly tangible. Ichabod Crane is an amiably unattractive hero, grotesque, brutal and greedy, his appetite for terror is his most endearing quality. The terrifying climax is wonderfully achieved, and if the resulting bathos and loss of ambiguity irritates, than Irving's surprisingly palatable (in small doses) style compensates. The movie (dare I say it) is much richer though."
2,"realistic story, but unentertaining delivery","This story might have been fleshed out better on stage in a play or a documentary. The story was realistic enough and the acting was decent but as a movie,it wasn't entertaining. The story telling wasn't good. i disliked the soundtrack, and the way the screen would pan to become a photo/or a still. It seemed reminiscent of a home movie or the backdrop of an cheesy KaraOK video. But i understand that this was the film maker's first attempt and i guess everyone has to start somewhere. 4 Stars for effort. For entertainment value or the film's ability to grab me viscerally, 2 Stars."
5,Well made.,I've been collecting dog figures like this one for several years and this is a nice and realistic addition!
4,"Heartbreakingly funny and reassuring for us ""normal"" folks","Heartbreaking yet funny, Hecht's collection of related stories delineates the travails of everyday living when one is a photographer of unwanted and unimagined series, a vegetarian, a committed environmentalist--with an aggressively normal husband. Moving in her rarefied world between East Hampton and Nantucket, with occasional terrified forays into the wilds of Manhattan to see her ""world famous reproductive specialist,"" she captures and makes even more ridiculous than one could have imagined our unspoken anxieties."
2,Not humorous--just annoying,"I must have read a totally different book from the NY Book Review reviewer because I would never use the word ""hilarious"" to describe this book. I must agree with the reviewer from Wisconsin who just found the author annoying, whining, and unsympathetic. This book is going into the Goodwill pile."
4,A superbly refreshing novel.,"Ms. Hecht's wit is truly unsurpassed. Her look at life is not only refreshing, but insightful as well. The narrator frequently expresses thoughts that we've all had but would never admit to. Her treatment of even the most mundane aspects of life is often hilarious, a prime illustration being when she hears the neighbor's boys arguing and hears one child refer to the other a certain offensive curse; she feels offended not because one child cursed the other, but because he used a verb incorrectly as a noun! In an era where we all appear to be taking our lives a bit too seriously, this novel provides a welcomed respite. Anyone who has ever lived in Manhattan should be able to truly appreciate this work. It won't 'probe your soul' but it will make you smile."
1,broke on me,"first use and it snapped on me. I had a broken spark plug stuck inside a scooter. I ordered this tool to try to remove the plug. The tool broke inside and is now stuck. Will probably have to try to drill it out now. This tool may be good for small projects, but it's useless for automotive."
2,1/4 to 3/8 is not usable,"I made the purchase because of the multiple languages involved, but it is really not a multilingual dictionary. Well, there are 8 sections with different primary language entries, but unfortunately, as a native Chinese speaker and a student in linguistic field, I cannot figure out the way the Chinese words are organized, neither by pronunciation nor stroke number. For example, in the Chinese section, ther first word is ""juji"" (to gather), the second one is ""ju-zhi-xianwei"" (polyester), and the third one is ""tui"" (leg). I don't see any logic in this sequencing, linguistically or realistically. There is no instructions explaining this works. So, there is no way for me to use this dictionary. Judging from my limited Japanese knowledge, the Japanese words are not arranged in alphabetical order either. If this is also true for the Korean section, 3/8 of this book is not usable."
4,Big Impact,This is my first read by this author. I found it to be engaging from the start. She writes with much insight and when I finished I felt I too had an understanding of a family who struggles with infertility and complicated choices involving family drama. The dynamics described in deciding how choices are made and the humanity of our mistakes and struggles with past lives coming to live in the present with us create an impact that makes us run or stay put. This one had a good lesson written with compassion and love.
3,Good Summer Read,"If you are looking for a quick summer read, this is it! It does deal with a character that does a bit of whining, but is an interesting look at the lives of 2 people.If you think you know your spouse and all their skeletons, read this book. It makes you wonder about who the person is on the other side of the bed."
3,cannery row review,i think this book was cool becuase they all get drunk and party and they arent very smart but the book lags because john stienbeck goes into a totally differnt story that has absolutly nothing to do with the main story like in chapter 14 i had a hard time paying attention to it the book really didnt have a big climax and i thought it could use more intensity.
3,Cannery Row,"Cannary Row was a good book.. it was very descriptive, as if you were actually in Monterey CA. At times the book got a little hard to understand, but very interesting. I enjoyed the characters. I liked how they all had rough times and got through them all one way or another. I would reccomend this book. I liked the book more towards the ending, the beginning started off a little slow, other than that it is an overall good book!"
5,My favorite of Steinbeck's works,"Another book I used while preparing to the verbal section of the GMAT. I have this one on my list of all-time favorites. Nothing is more interesting that the life of simple people who don't busy themselves with the stockmarket, business school, or even electricity. They live in California, slip under the boats, and eat whatever God sends them. Great contrast for a bschool applicant with abmitions and desires to change to change the world and beat the strongest.Favorites:The logic; quite similar to that in the Tortilla Flat of striving for the greater ""good"" for a friend. I loved how the bums justify their crimes and glorify mistakes. Some paralells can be found in some corporate repots.Nothing beats the frog hunting scene and the ""new"" monetary system.I could not stop laughing while reading - one of the funniest and profound pieces."
4,California dreaming on Cannery Row,"Steinbeck's 'Cannery Row' is an endearing snapshot of the small community that sprung up around the Sardine Canneries of Monterey. Although far lighter than 'The Grapes of Wrath', Steinbeck's characters still have great depth and remain engaging.Doc, the head of Western Biologicals on The Row, is a complex fellow and, as such, is the lynchpin of the book. He has an essentially kindly nature, but also a mysterious, tragic air that holds your attention. His neighbours and associates provide the book's colour: Lee Chong, the shopkeeper; Mack and his hopeless, but well-meaning companions; and Dora Flood, enigmatic Mistress of the local brothel.Collectively, Steinbeck's likeable heroes and heroines make for an effortless and pleasurable read."
5,simply wonderful,"when reading this book, i fell into the present-oriented society that was cannery row. the plot may seem minimal but is so endearing because of the realism. nothing seemed to hit Mack and the guys too hard. you have to read this book. you'll love it."
5,Masterpiece,"This being the one of the few books I can actually read more than once, I just had to review it. Although some people are right in saying that the plot isn't as strong as it could be, these people only need to look a little deeper. The second chapter alone, with its description of Lee Chong and Mack and the boys is a pure literary masterpiece. If you are in doubt about whether to read this book or not, read it. Read it simply because it will teach you although life isn't perfect, the little good things make it worthwhile."
4,A Novel with a Lovely Theme,"Cannery row is a straight-forward book filled with memorable characters. It seems to lack a plot yet it is very challenging to put down. The novel tells the story of many different characters and how they live and interact with one another. Some of the characters are truly magnificent people with a good heart. Most are doing the right thing for a great person. And some are crazy, but would do anything for someone they love. There are chapters that introduce us to new characters that seem to have almost no part in the story, but somehow are related to a character form before. In the end their stories are all woven together.The novel is wonderfully written and I could visualize everything that was going on. There are times when I just had to laugh and times when I was close to tears. This is a quick read because it is simple and clear-cut, but the story could very well stay with you forever."
3,My review,"I thought that cannery row was an okay book. There were some awesome characters, with good stories. The point where I think I lost interest was right at the ending. Maybe b/c I really didn't quite understand what point John Steinbeck was trying to put accross."
3,Cannery row review,This book had some comedy and some deep stuff that was harder to understand... The short stories on the people of cannery row seemed to clutter the book and offered nothing but a few pages to the book.
3,The Cannery Row Review by Greg Marchion,"I think that this book is a ok book, but definatly not the best book I have ever read. This book lack the action that I like to read about. Although it's still a good book for younger students to read."
3,So-so,"This book is very much like a Hemingway book. A story about people interacting with each other, but containing no real plot. Just a tale of people's lives. Cannery Row probably has a strong appeal to English teachers and historians of the Great Depression and surely Steinbeck has many themes and symbols woven into the book that would appeal to to such types. But strictly speaking of entertainment value, this is not a book that produces any great anticipation and lacks any exciting development. I'm sure I'd enjoy it more if I read about the deeper meanings hidden within."
4,Cannery Row Review for Ms. Shannon's class,"Cannery Row is one of the few books i have read lately, and i like it. I usually dont read books but i have read this one from front to back. I really appreciate the usage of his descripive words. They explain a lot about the setting and the characters. I have enjoyed reading this book. Thank you John Steinback."
5,American Folklore at its Best,"Steinbeck has a way of telling a tale of thecomman man which breathes life into the mythoswhich support our culture. America has long hadan affinity for the exploits of those who liveon it's fringes. The drifters, the con men, thedreamers and searchers doomed to anonymity wereit not for the likes of authors such as Steinbeck.This is a simple tale, but told so well it can beread again and again..."
3,"Oh, the humanity","I can never bring myself to have the affection for Steinbeck's characters that he obviously has. They're liars and cheats and layabouts, I can't stand them. He's so good natured about it and reserves all his contempt and hatred for the few women characters who grace his pages."
2,not what I expected...,"definitely not the item that i was expecting. VERY tiny. not a regular size notebook like i was expecting. very pretty design, but not worth what i paid for it."
2,size matters!,"when an item says notebook, it should be notebook size. this item was memo pad size and i purchased 3 for the school year for my daughters. being 4x6 size was disappointing, i already purchased small memo pads for them to record homework assignments."
3,Beautiful,"Beautiful but way too small. Great price but I thought this notebook was much larger. I will still get use out of it, however, looking on the bright side it will be a lighter carry. The price was amazing. Good deal."
2,A diverting read,"This is the first of Perez-Reverte's novels that I have read. I found his descriptions of Seville interesting and the plot was engaging. I was a bit put off by the fact that all of his priests, monsignors, bishops, etc., (even the ""good guys"")readily admitted an utter lack of faith in the Church they purported to represent; but I still found the book well worth reading. Having seen from some of the other reader-reviews that this is considered by some to be Perez-Reverte's weakest book, I look forward to reading the others."
2,Read The Club Dumas instead.,"I bought this book because I found The Club Dumas to be excellent. I was deeply disappointed. Where The Club Dumas sparkled, The Seville Communion merely exists, and while The Club Dumas transcended its genre, The Seville Communion is deeply rooted in it. And that's a shame, because it means the mastery exhibited in The Club Dumas is a one shot deal rather than the arrival of a major literary talent"
1,Yuck,"A real letdown. Club Dumas was somewhat interesting, so I picked this up. In Seville Communion, the writing is lame and incredibly flawed, there's little feel for Seville (except that it smells like oranges, ok, I get it already), the characters are cardboard, and the plot is thin and obvious, except when it gets to the end, where it's just ridiculous. A total waste of time. This is the sort of thing Dean Koontz would've tossed off 20 years ago. I guess I was expecting more from a Spanish writer."
4,Interesting and informative.,"I recently ordered this book, and was very happy at it's speedy arrival. Thank you once again Amazon. But what I really wanted to comment on was how much I enjoyed the Book. It was very interesting and informative. I was also pleased that not only did I get a history of the Native American tribes that used various herbs in thier traditional medicines, But also the use of the herbs in thier rituals. I was also very pleased that they also included the recipes as well. I dont understand how some of the comments say that they book was too vague, it gave in detail how and when certain herbs were used. As well as the culture of the Native people's. This is a must read for anyone that is interested in a more natural way to treat illness or disease. I could not put it down once, I started reading. I can only say that I learned much more than I was expecting, I highly reccomond it for your personal herbal library."
2,"Can only beautiful, slim, women pose nude?","I gave the book two stars, one for the beautiful cover and the other for the simple fact that all the photographs were in black and white. `The Art of Nude Photography' disappointed me greatly.I would have preferred a book that depicted all bodies, ages, and genders. This book focused on beautiful, young, slim women. At times I thought the composition was overly commercial and unimaginative. There were a handful of photographs that I thought worthy of a 13""x10"" coffee table book but not enough to make it worth buying.girldiver;)"
3,History,"The book itself is rather good. What I can't stand is, it's ignoring the facts. Ci-Xi is definitely NOT the last empress of China. The last one is Wanrong. I know, because I am Chinese. Wanrong led a very tragical life, as she was the very last empress, at the end of the Qing dynasty. She was there when it fell. Ci-Xi is like her husband's aunt or something."
2,Inspired work of fiction,"I have studied late Ch'ing dynasty in detail from Chinese sources and can safely say that I have never encountered a more distorted and fictional view of the period. Seagrave's thesis that the 'evil legend' of Tz'u-hsi was invented by Bland and Backhouse is false: apart from the material based on the Ching-shan diary, virtually everything in 'China under the Empress Dowager' is based on authentic Chinese sources. Seagrave creates an imaginary political scenario of a court dominated by a fictitious 'Ironhat' clique. Virtually every page in this book contains some sort of error, distortion, sweeping judgement based on minimal evidence, fabrication or even an ocasional barefaced lie. If you want a true picture of the late Ch'ing, read Marina Warner's biography of Tz'u-hsi. A comprehensive and accurate account can be found in the five-volume 'Ch'ing-tai t'ung-shih' by Hsiao I-shan. Seagrave's book is an entertaining novel."
2,A nasty book,"Heart of a Jagaur is about a boy named Balam who lives in a Mayan village close to Chichen Itza. He is 14 years old, and really wants to become a man and live in the bachelor house.I gave this book two stars out of five stars because it was a really gory book that was way too desriptive. It teaches you about the Mayas, but the author really didn't have to describe a person reaching into a jaguar and taking out its heart! (Like it did.) Overall it was a bad book (in my opinion) and I recommend you never read it unless you like gory, descriptive books."
2,Bad book is NASTY,I think that the book was not very good. Its plot was the same as alot of other things that I have seen and read. It was about a boy growing up in a Mayan family. He is trying to become a man. The town is at a major water loss and they need to make a sacrifice. The end of the book is where you find out what the major sacrifice that they need to make is. I did not like the book because it is very nasty in a couple of ways. One of the main ones is goriness. All in all this book has a very usual plot and is nasty and not a good book.
4,Brando spoils it for everyone else,"The Missouri Breaks has all the elements for a great western- lush locations in Montana, beautiful cinematography, authentic production design, a script by Thomas McGuane, and a solid cast (for the most part). Then Marlon Brando appears, apparently from another planet, and ruins the effect with a performance that can be charitably described as eccentric- adopting and discarding accents and funny hats at will, talking to his horse, and so on. The frustrating part is that Brando is hilarious! I just wish he'd wreaked havoc on a more deserving film than this one."
3,A Sorry State of Affairs,"Tennessee Williams' play, A Streetcar Named Desire, is about three depressing characters named Blanche DuBois and Stella and Stanley Kowalski. Of the three, Blanche, who is Stella's sister, is the most pathetic. The story is about her losing her sanity. It's almost like she is standing on a ledge and balancing back and forth until she finally falls off. Blanche sets the tone for what will eventually happen. She says in Scene I, ""I was so exhausted by all I'd been through, my nerves broke. I was on the verge of lunacy, almost!"" By the end, she is not on the verge any longer. She goes over the edge. She hints at it before the doctor and nurse come to take her away. ""I'll be buried at sea sewn up in a clean white sack and dropped overboard -- at noon -- in the blaze of summer -- and into an ocean as blue as my first lover's eyes."""
2,Abusive man alert,"I'm not generally impressed with plays and movies of this era, as they portray a time when it was considered acceptable for men to treat women as property. Women endured physical as well as emotional and psychological violence, without a inkling that something may be wrong about that. When Blanche encourages Stella to leave Stanley after he hits her after the poker game, I agreed very firmly with her. I was amazed that Stella returns, and that she still stays with him after what he does to Blanche near the end of the play. Blanche is written as flighty and slutty and her final fate is galling because I believe she's the only character in the play with a lick of sense. I found myself reading this quite quickly because I just wanted it over with. The whole thing repulsed me."
4,A Very Dramatic Play,"I found interesting to see, how the story changed during the play. First I thought the visit of Blanche was just a normal one. But I found out, there is a lot more about it, it has probably been an escape from her old place. But the rumours follow her to New Orleans. More and more the story gets strange and Stanley becomes the person responsible for what happens. This I found well done. The end, when Blanche is taken to the lunatic asylum, fits very well with the rest of the plot."
5,Master & Commander,"This is the first of the Aubrey / Maturin novels and is the fourth time of reading and still the the experience is refreshing. The language and civility of the narrative makes one wonder that western civilization is now on the decline. How much has technology taken away the beautiful interaction between man and nature; when to travel around the world, all it took was wind, water , and the knowledge how to utilize them."
4,Another Adventure,"This second volume in the Aubrey/Maturin Series continues both the friendship and the adventure for the two protagonists. They vie for love, struggle with poverty, and continue to harass both French and Spanish shipping. Anyone who enjoys a good sea adventure will be sure to be entertained."
3,A tough read that demands patience,"O'Brian's writing style is not for everyone, and like Master and Commander, Post Captain is not an easy read. It demands concentration and a degree of patience from the reader, and assumes prior familiarity with the characters. It is not a sequel that can be read before the first book of the series or else the reader will be quite lost and confused. It would also help to have read Forester's Horatio Hornblower series before taking on O'Brian's Jack Aubrey. Still Aubrey is a compelling character and Dr. Maturnin is what one might imagine a naturalist and man of letters of the Napoleonic era to have been like."
4,Just fine,"This is not a very pricey car seat but I think it's just fine. We have bought more expensive and presumeably safer cars seats, but with twins and the need to have 4 seats, I got this one because it was lightweight and could be used more for in and out of my husband's car and family members that might take the babies. God forbid we should ever be in an accident and have to really test them out, but they seem safe and sturdy enough for older babies."
4,great seat for the price,We brought this seat for the daughter when she out grew her infant seat. I think we paid about $35.00 at wal mart for it. It lasted her two years and then we used it with oru son for a year until the plastic on the seat(where you hook up the harness broke. It is also easy to clean. Alothough taking off the cover can be a little tricky.
1,"Unclear, hazy music track..like old phonograph!",my disc is in perfect condtion but the music sounds slightly scratchy or like you put cellophane in your ears before you listened...very odd
5,Finally,"This is getting a 5 star review mainly because it is not the standard batch of songs found on other Motown era compilations. Most of these songs are getting their debut on CD, and while some are surely not ground breaking, they deserve to be heard. ""The Bigger You Love (The Harder You Fall)"" is a big surprise to me. I have never heard this one and I am bowled over by it. It's hot! Other highlights are ""You Gave Me Something To Believe In"" and ""If Yu Don't Love Me"". It doesn't include a couple of songs that you would think would be on here, (Daddy's Home and You Like Me Dont't You), even so, this is the best compilation out there..."
5,BIG BROTHER - JERMAINE,"I dont think I am alone, for my age group, of almost dismissing anything Jacksons as not really my kind of Motown. However, I'm into my 2nd play on the trot of this CD, and its a cracker, you can see the Smokey R influence, IF YOU DONT LOVE ME...that is a killer track.... closely followed by YOU GAVE ME SOMETHING TO BELIEVE IN & then THATS HOW LOVE GOES or LETS BE YOUNG TONIGHT... hardly a bad sound on their..well done Spectrum..yet again..great value for money...best MOTOWN CD release to date is the double Elgins...wow!!!"
3,Great moments for a B movie,"This film offers glimpses of Wayne's greatness that would only come after he was more well known. The plot is a simple B-movie western. Local ranchers are being strong-armed by the landowner (Kincaid) who has the only water rights to Lost Creek. Facing the prospects of selling out for a dollar an acre, the ranchers write to Washington for help. Wayne shows up as ""Singing Sandy Saunders"", the undercover agent sent to investigate. The shootout that ensues between Wayne and Kincaid's gunman is worth the price of the film. Wayne approaches the gunman singing an old cowboy gunfighter song. The director got a really great close-up shot of Wayne approaching the gunman as he stops singing and says, ""Make it fast slippery, this is your last draw."" Overlook some of the hoaky B-movie acting by the supporting cast. Wayne is as great as ever."
2,"Helpful, but with errors.","This book offered many helpful pointers to a technician who hasn't done hospital work and needs some refreshing on mathematical procedures. But if you're turning to this book for Chapter 7's Top 200 Drugs, be prepared to learn incorrect information. There were strengths that weren't listed, incorrect strengths listed, and the use of the drugs was vague to questionable. The practice tests also differ from the actual certification test. I spent hours stressing and trying to memorize facts and dates that the actual test never even touched on. Some was helpful, but some was not quite right."
5,Great Treasury,"This treasury is a very complete edition. Beautiful illustrations throughout, with several full color illustrations as well. Lovely antique feel - makes an excellent heirloom book to pass down."
5,for reading with the grandkids,I was raised with nursery rhymes and can still remember most of them. Now I can read them to the kids when they visit and soon they will be able to read them to me. It wil be good practice for them and Granny's eyes aren't as good as they used to be (just an excuse to have them read to me)!
3,older versions of classic rhymes,The wording may be different from the rhymes you remember but almost all of them are here. I was quite pleased to find a few I'd been looking for but could never remember enough of to find.
3,"Beautiful music, poor mastering/audio quality","There is no question about the brilliance of Oscar Peterson's mastery of piano jazz.This is a great selection of songs, but they marred by the quality of the mastering of this album in digital format. There is a very pronounced audible noise/hiss overlaying just about every track, as if one were listening to something over AM radio."
3,"Nice looking hinge, but countersinks not deep enough","This is a nice looking hinge, but the countersinks in the hinge plate are not deep enough to fully sink the screws provided. This results in the hinge not being able to fully close. I had to grind the screw heads down to get the hinge to work so that my bathroom cabinet door could close all the way. Also, one of the hinges came with only 5 screws instead of 6."
2,"Easy install, but be careful it works with your vehicle","The Hopkins taillight converter kit arrived quickly, and was easy to install if you have basic understanding of wiring. The provided tester was cheap, but got the job done. The quality of the product seemed fine given the inexpensive price point.However, be careful to make sure it works with your vehicle. After installing I used the tester in the plug to check the left and right indicators and the running light -- all worked fine. But when hooking it up to the trailer, the running light worked, but the indicators would blink once then shut off. After doing a bit more digging, it seems I needed a powered converter."
5,Best cut capo,"If you haven't explored the world of cut capos yet, you simply must try it. When you do, get a Shubb. I've played with both this Shubb and with the Kyser spring-clamp capo. I prefer Kysers for full capos because they're quick to put on and can be stored on the headstock easily. But when it comes to versatility with a cut capo the Shubb can't be beat. This capo is very compact and the bevel on the rubber makes fingering the adjacent string possible, while the Kyser extends much further and blocks access to the adjacent string. I just hang my Shubb on my music stand to keep it handy, and it doesn't take very long to put it on the neck either."
4,"One of the best, but missing just a bit more...",I thought this was beautifully written and put together very well. The instructions on the different crochet stiches are very easy to understand. My only gripe is that I felt there should be more crochet patterns.
1,Don't waist your money,So full of mistakes. Where ever she got the patterns she did not translate them well. Totally ripped off Dot Matthews. Bought rights to her pattern and didn't even write it correctly.
1,Lots of hype,"I am going to return my copy. There are many mistakes in the patterns. If you buy this book, be sure to go to her website for the countless errata pages. Or just wait until a correct edition is published. The patterns are cute, but as another reviewer said, you can find similar patterns on the internet or in magazines for free. Although she created none of the patterns, she is seen modelling almost every one, with her leering face on practically every page.The history of crochet section is not original. In fact, much of it is a rehash of a truly great crochet book, ""Encyclopedia of Crochet"" by Donna Kooler.The instructions are confusing for a beginner and Ms. Stoller flatly refuses to acknowledge left handed people. She haughtily says that left-handers will just have to learn to do everything in the book backwards, ""and I mean everything."" Feh."
2,You've been warned...,"This is a fun book; very inspirational. That being said, unless you are an experienced crocheter (or know one), put away your wallet and save yourself the time-- the hours-- you will spend ripping back and puzzling over instructions: VERY POORLY WRITTEN INSTRUCTIONS and errors galore. (Sorry, the online Errata don't even begin to cover all the problems.) Deb Stoller, please hire a technical editor and someone to test-crochet the submissions for your next book."
2,"Cute Patterns, but Not for a Beginner","I was so excited to get this book--Finally a crochet book with cute patterns. Here's the problem--I am not a beginning crocheter and I had problems understanding some of the directions. On the more complicated patterns, they just are not clear enough. On top of that, there are so many errors that you'd better check the errata page for this book before beginning ANY pattern. When you have pages on other websites dedicated to co-crocheters trying to help one another figure out how to work through a pattern, I'd say you have a problem. Still, several of the patterns are cute. So, if you have a very good handle on crochet and reading patterns--and you have a lot of patience, go for it! If you really are a beginner, go for something that was edited better!"
5,crochet book (used),"The book I received was in perfect condition, almost new. What a price for a ""new book""; LOVE IT."
2,great book incorrect instructions,"This book is great as far as instruction on how to chrochet and she actually has stylish hip projects that you would really wear and fool others that they were purchased and not a homemade project. However upon making one of these projects I began to realize that the instructions were incorrect. I went to the Stitch n' Bitch website and there were corrections for the FIRST edition. Mine was the second and still contained errors. I emailed the author at the email listed on the site and received no aknowledgement on how to complete the error filled pattern. I winged the project myself and it turned out okay, but I wouldn't recommend the book as the correction page on her web site was extensive and I worry that other projects will still be problematic which is frustrating when so much time is involved in doing them."
2,okay..,"it's okay, I just bought it for one pattern. The rest leave a bit to be desired. If you are young, maybe...."
3,Falls short of expectations - full of mistakes and difficult instructions,"I was very optimistic about this book. She's clever and funny so it's an interesting read but I had a lot of difficulty following her instructions and diagrams for learning the stitches. It's not as clear as it could be. Then I went to her Web site and found that there are TONS of mistakes throughout her books. This book may still be worth buying for the patterns, but I think everybody should check out the mistakes (see www.knithappens.com) before purchase so you know what you're getting into and don't make mistakes with the projects."
5,Best crochet book ever!,"This is by far the best book about crochet ever written. I have been crocheting for about 20 years, but I think this book is perfect for anyone who wants to learn how to crochet or anyone who wants a refresher. The author explains everything in super simple terms, and adds some wit to make it interesting and fun to read. The illustrations are actual color photos rather than drawings which makes it even easier to follow along and understand how to make the stitches. There are also some great patterns to try out. I highly recommend this book to veteran crocheters or beginners."
1,Loaded with fallacious logic,"I read the book with interest and an open mind. The conclusions the author makes are often unfounded. There are some interesting historical descriptions and the most important contribution of the book was to depict that K was actually a human - and in my mind that made him even greater, because being a human he understood the human condition. But the author appears to constantly want to attack K for being a human and many of her conclusions seem to be inaccurate and unfounded - at least they are not presented with much solid logic."
2,Badly organized not enough detail,"I work as an Apps DBA. I happened to get a hold of this book and read thro' it to see if it contained anything useful. Its awful. Its badly organized.There is no explanation on the architecture, no examples on how to use the adutilities and when to use them. Its very theoritical and not practial.There is more emphasis on windows (I havent heard of many decent sized businesses running oracle applications on windows)"
5,You'll never need another how-to book,"This book may have a hefty price, but it is well worth it. I purchased it originally just for photo class, but it is the best book that I could have bought. There is everything photographers could ever want to know, and it grows with you. If you are a beginner, then just start slowly with the first few chapters that guide you through cameras, film, and developing and then progress to more complicated things. I recommend this book to every photographer because it is a wonderful reference book for any questions you have."
3,Anti-Catholic Author,"This is the first book by this author that I have read. I thought it was really funny--alot of ironical humor which is my favorite. What I did not like was her obvious anti-Catholic attitude. Her selection of the Catholic parish name, Blessed Sacrement, aka, ""BS"" was a blantant slap in the face to all Catholics. Now, since I liked the book, I'll give the lady one more chance and will read ""The Persian Pickle Club"" next, but anymore low blows to the Catholic Church and I'll cross this author off my list."
5,Logic Review,"I wish I had a book like this while I was going to school. Its not easy to realise that one is living without this precious knowledge all the way into adulthood. I would advise everyone to get this book, set aside time with family or by themselves, and study this book. Better yet, invite friends and family to sit and learn this work. What a treasure!"
1,Rip off,"How could Irene Cara herself take part in this ""duet""? She probably needed the money....DJ Bobo is horrible and ruins the song"
5,Mistah,Unable to use this item. Requested return. Have worked out a workable agreement with seller. Couldn't be happier with solution
1,not what you think,"First off this helmet is enormous, even in a medium. It is the right size for my head and fits ok but I might as well flip it upside down because is sits on the top of my head and doesn't really go on or around it. There is so much padding inside it that it does not even slide halfway down your head. Obviously a knock off with the materials used. I don't understand why there are so many good reviews! The chrome looks nice but it's so easily corrupted that I scratched it with my fingernails trying to get the stickers off of it. I can understand that in order for it to be DOT approved that it should include a lot of padding but the only way this helmet would be safe is if you fell straight down from the sky onto your head. I am definitely returning this helmet despite having to pay for shipping both ways. I will up my rating review if the refund goes smoothly."
5,My kids love it,My kides and I love Zoey. It is to bad it isn't on the air anymore. Their grandfather likes watching it with them.
5,Better than Hornblower,In fact a lot better.Forester kept to the straight Tory partyline. O'Brian does not and he is a lot more informative about the then naval matters. And also about a great many other matters.
5,Art Alphin = a lifetime of accuracy!,"Col. Alphin's 'Any Shot You Want' is extremely accurate, informative, and written to comprehend. Having served in the military with Col. Alphin (2nd Armored Division - 1975) as his M-60A1 Tank gunner, I am not at all surprised at the devotion to detail nor his passion to share his vast expertise with both novice and expert firearm enthusiasts. He is well-known and respected throughout the world as a 'hunter's hunter' having gained practical knowledge in the field allowing us to benefit from his experience! Kudos to you, sir, ...""Buffalo""!"
5,A must-have for Yardbirds fans,"If you are a fan of The Yardbirds, you'll want to add The Jim McCarty Blues Band's 'Outside Woman Blues' to your collection. Jim (founding member of The Yardbirds/Box Of Frogs) along with current Yardbird vocalist John Idan, Former Mott/British Lion Ray Majors and former Strawb Rod Demmick turn out an excellent blues/rock album. The best cover version I've ever heard of Cream's 'Outside Woman Blues' kicks off the album and original songs penned by McCarty and more super cover versions follow. Leiber & Stoller's 'Framed' Warren Zevon's 'Lawyers,Guns & Money'and a remake of The Box of Frogs' 'Two Steps Ahead'...McCarty's 'Heavy Weather' and 'No Easy Way Out' are easily on par with his compositions for The Yardbirds. Dont miss this one!"
2,Less than I expected.,"I received The Gershwin Songbook, ""'Swonderful."" My complaint has nothing to do with Amazon or the supplier. I'm just a traditionalist, and found the music and singing to be less than satisfying. As an arranger or singer, how could you possibly think your sense of rhythm or your lyrical ability could exceed that of the master? I'm here to tell you that neither of yours did. Just play the music and sing the lyrics as they were written so the listeners can sing along, snap their fingers and reminisce about happier times."
4,"""Fellini-esque"" Tradtional Brass Band Gets Hip","Beautiful and irresistible brass band from Italy, fans of Tom Waits would love it, has a very similar feel to some of his work - nicely orchestrated, moody dirges.Track one features guest vocals by Dani ""El Mono Loco"" Carbonell, of Macaco and Ojos de Brujo. Other vocalists appear and they are great too. Mostly an instrumental album though."
5,Good Cigar Journal,"This is a smart looking dossier with plenty of entries to last you a long time. There are fields on each entry for Brand, Size, Where Purchased, Price, Box/Individual, Time Smoked, Date, Rating, Last Meal Eaten & Time, Wrapper, and of course a Comments section. There's even a place to put the bands from each cigar.I've only just started, so I'm not sure if adding the bands will make the journal thicker than the binding. Use a glue stick instead of tape, and you'll be able to fit more.The only thing it lacks is a ""Country of Origin"" field. But the Comments section is big enough to include that if you like.All in all, a great buy. Recommended with 5 stars."
4,VERY REFRESHING,"I found GO MY WAY to be not only refreshing but a very laid back cd. Full of some tight jammin' that makes it easy to listen to from start to finish. Funny though, Trower is cursed in the fact that he was one of those guys(like Frank Marino)who in the 70's. If you played with any testical fortatude you were compared to Jimi Hendrix,lol. Now it seems all the other reviewers are comparing Trower to himself. I would and have recommended this cd to alot of folks based on it's own merits."
3,Not bad for a kid,"I actually didn't know this book was written by a yound adult. I got this book for my husband because he likes fantasy, but found myself reading, unable to put it down. The first several pages are very good at drawing you in. The action does get a little predictable. Also what I didn't like is that, even though I know many people use other author's ideas, I started wondering if this kid read the Tolken books a few too many times. From start to finish I could see where the Tolken books were an influence. Maybe he didn't mean for it to sound like that, I don't know. Also, I did find myself wanting more interaction with the boy and the dragon, they are the main characters, and yet for most of the first half of the book they don't even talk to each other much, let alone enteract with each other. All in all I thought it was a good book."
2,book report,This book was really just a book report on Lord Of the Rings and other geat novels. he put it into his own words and changed the names around but alot of the story was based on LOTR. I didnt realize this after reading them both. Their were a few things different so I give it two instead of one
5,the newest WOW book,This book is extremely well written. It easily compares to other fantasy books I've read (quite a substantial amount)!
1,rip off,"this thing sucks a**, it's just a rip off of the lord of the rings (which are actually very good books) the plot is too slow too dull, I keep catching things that came straight out of the Lord of the Rings. It's like some fifteen-year-old kid decided to write a novel, but he couldn't come up with anything so he ripped off a great series."
1,"""I love you, little one""","Overuse, and improper use, of language - no starsBoring, one dimensional characters - no starsBoring one dimensional and repetitive plot devices - no starsAbsence of originality, but the weyrcat pretty cool anyway - one starBrom/Eragon relationship okay - one starEragon/Arya relationship (with yucky adolescent wet dreams) - MINUS one star.Getting me to read The Eye of the Wheel - 3 starsHaving my husband leave me annoying voice mail in a deep raspy voice saying ""I love you little one"" - 5 starsAnd that adds up to one star. No Paolini in my future."
5,AMAZING,"this book is absolutly amazing. im not to much of a fantasy fan, but this book has fantasy, mystery, adventure, amazing characters, amazing plot, amazing places. this is a great book!"
5,Couldn't Put It Down,"When my grandma gave Eragon to me two weeks ago , I thought it was going to be boring. Boy, was I ever wrong! I think Christopher Poalini did awesome for a fifteen-seventeen year old!I finished it twelve days ago, but I still find myself thinking about it. I can't belive he was only seventeen! I'm trying to get my friends to read it, but they are too stuborn. Eragon was so good I coudn't put it down to do my homework. [That is NOT like me!!!] I never went outside to play or anything that I couldn't do with the book. If you pick up this book, you will not put it down until you have read all 509 pages. I like the way he put the glossery in the back. I also referred to the map several times as I read. It may be long, but I would not change a single word. I have not read any of the books the author supposedly copied, but I loved this book! I won't critisize Eragon or the author until I can write a better book. Forget all the bad reveiws, this is an awesome book!"
1,Falls flat,"Mr. Paolini states on his wen site that, in his writing: ""I strive for a lyrical beauty somewhere between Tolkien at his best and Seamus Heaney's translation of Beowulf"". You ain't even close kid. You don't deserve to walk in Tolkien's shadow, and stealing ideas, names, plot devices, etc. from him will never make you a good author. Oh--one other note--some else's translation of a dark ages heroic epic is not something you should be striving to mimic from a stylistic standpoint--sort of like trying to capture the ""essence"" of a reproduction of a Monet. Pretty stupid when you think about it..."
2,Cute story but its been done,"While I applaud the kid's efforts and see a fine writing future for him, I must point out that this book is a regurgitation of every other major fantasy series to date. If it were not in fact his parent's publishing company I doubt he would have been published. The story itself is cute, but the writer is young and needs many more years of polishing before he can reach the standards of those authors he's parroting in this book. It's quite sad that there is nothing new in this book. I had hoped for better."
2,Not quite there,"Paolini has some storytelling merit, to be sure. Why else would his book be selling well? The plotline and characters are certainly interesting. But they're not interesting *enough*--I constantly found myself capable of reading a chapter, feeling more or less entertained, and then putting it down with absolutely no subconscious need to pick it up again. Whenever I did continue reading, I wasn't bored, but I also never felt the compulsion to finish. The story is too much of a cliche, and there is really nothing about Saphira or Eragon that seemed unique enough to pull them out of the stereotypical dragon or adolescent hero-kid of mass-produced fantasy novels. The writing itself was decent, but not great. But the book was also not so bad as to make me *not* recommend it to other viewers. In a nutshell, so-so."
1,intensely boring,"As a girl, I could not relate to any of the characters in this book. I like to be able to relate to at least one person. The female characters WERE all for him, him, him. Girls today know better, and stories that do this are intensely BORING to us. Mothers, if you give your daughters this book, you might as well tell them to forget about being a person in their own right. If they're beautiful and enjoy falling in love with adolescent boys for no particular reason, and then . . . BORING!! Oh poor me, I'm such a beautiful elf languishing in prison. Help me, help me. Bad enough that this book is unoriginal. It's also dull."
5,Excellent Book,The beginning is a little slow but once you get through the first couple of chapters you are hooked! It makes you feel like you are there fighting with Eragon and makes you want to keep reading. I am ready to find out what happens in the next.
1,You can't judge a book by it's cover,"Okay, I admit it, the cover art drew me in. Unfortunately, the writing quickly threw me right back out. This book's editor should be simultaneously disbarred and pelted with marshmallows. Wow! This book is a real stinker."
4,"That was a convincing review, Mr. Random","That was a convincing review, though you didn't have to be so rude with saying that we would not understand it. I got it perfectly well, though I disagree on one point.Eragon gets 3.5 stars from me. I did become lost in the world, but the characters I did not care for. While not the lifeless characters everyone claims them to be, they are not as good as they should have been. I didn't care for them, and they took away from the quality of the story... I also disagree with your mention about plot (or at least I think it was you). I did not find the plot particularly twisty and turny...3.5 stars, yeah, but you are absolutely right, Mr. (or possibly Ms.) Random. We should grade on how well an author tells his story, how enthralled we were in the world he created, how good his characters are, and how engaging the plot was.You do not, however, need to say that all of those poor one-star reviewers do not know what they are talking about.Just my two cents..."
1,Perhaps the worst book that I have ever read,"To call this book bad would be an understatement, it goes beyond bad, it's outright terrible!! I can't believe that this book was even published. It was written by a teenager and it shows, It reads more like a high school project, something he had to do for an creative writing class. I'm not going to go into great detail why this book is so bad, it just is."
5,Equal or Better to Harry Potter,"Lots of the reviews make this book sound terrible, but I think they are ALL WRONG.I have read this book twice (some parts more than that)and I have loved it every time. I have read alll of the Harry Potter books (and loved all of them)and I think this book is At LEAST just as just as good (if not better).Plot 5/5Depth 5/5Overall Awesomeness 10/5Some people complain that this book is a rip-off of other fantasy books. I think that is rediculous because this is COMPLETELY UNLIKE anything I have ever read (which is a lot due to the fact that I am a HUGE LOTR fan and was a huge fan of Star Wars books).Any person who likes fantasy or Harry Potter would LOVE THIS BOOK."
5,Absolutly the best book I've ever read (and i've read many books),This book is an excellent way to be wisked away for the weekend (or 2 or 3 depending on your reading level). It revolves around a poor farm boy who makes a extrordinary discovery of a dragon egg. I won't get into any of the details but the plot twists keep you guessing until the end. I haven't read Eldest (book 2) yet but its sure to be just as good if not better.
4,Best story ever!!!,"The story was great and all but I do feel that the author copied a little bit. Eragon came frome the term of Aragorn from the lord of the rings. The fights on the other hand are awsome. I already know that they shall soon be making a movie out of this at the end of 2006. The enemies were sort of copied too. The so called Urgals a type of orc-like creature had something that represented the uruk-hai: the Kull faster,stronger, and bigger. But at least Christopher Paolini didnt copy the story.I would recomend the story to any one who likes fantasy"
1,A waste of paper,"One of my friends recommended this book, so I had high hopes for it. Alas, my hopes were dashed. This book blatantly rips off elements of other major fantasy stories--mainly Tolkien and Anne McCaffrey. A main character named Eragon who is a Dragon Rider that can communicate telepathically with his dragon. Gee, how original. And all the names are so unimaginative that I'm torn between laughing and crying at the travesty (a blue dragon named Saphira? Come on!). It's pretty much a cliched travelogue. Ugh. I'm rarely moved to write reviews but this book really just blew it. If you want some good fantasy, there's plenty of much better stuff out there--try some Robin McKinley, for instance."
2,"Nothing new, why the hype?","Story was okay, just not the best writing. Seemed like a typical fantasy with absolutely no surprises. There are a lot better fantasies out there--try the Book of Three or even Tamora Pierce before this..."
3,A bit over-rated (it's surely not the next Harry Potter....),"I read the hyped up reviews and bought the book, but it's really your standard ""sword & sorcery"" epic. Great chunks of it are lifted from The Lord of the Rings--dwarves, elfs, a wise old wizard, a mysterious quest and so on. It's the same old drill.The lead character Eragon isn't remarkably likable, either. Seems to be self-righteous teenager. The book is fine as a diversion, but lacks the humor to make it anything out of the ordinary. It lacks the wit of Harry Potter, the mystery of The Da Vinci Code (great book!), or the true epic power of Rings trilogy. If you like this kind of banal quest fantasy, it's fine, but otherwise, look elsewhere."
2,"Ummmmm. . . . . Beautiful Jacket, I guess","Before I begin, I have to give a nod to the author who, after all, is only 19 years old. If any of my students wrote this well, I'd be very impressed. That said, I still don't think young Paolini is anywhere near ready for publishing, and I'm frankly a little confused as to both how and why this book was accepted and marketed so lavishly.The plot line is predictable, the diaglogue trite, and the writing style very clearly that of a beginner. I read to page 200, hoping and hoping that something would happen to justify the glowing reviews featured on the dust cover. Unfortunately, nothing did, and I just can't make myself go on. This book may interest very young teens (although in our post-Harry Potter world, perhaps not), but otherwise, I would caution against wasting either the money or the time."
3,okay i guess...,"It's a good book but everything that happens pretty much mirrors the Lord of The Rings Trilogy. Like Eragon(Aragorn), the Vault of Souls(Paths of the Dead), the ra'zac(Ringwraiths). Anyway you get my point, read it if you really want to but, I'd personally would recommend Lord of The Rings."
4,He's Still Young,"Although this guy crafts an excellent plot, he's horrible at poetry. He tries to use poetic descriptions that don't work. However, he seems to pick up a better flow later in the book and writes an interesting story using a unique and original scheme of magic use. One other problem: the exaggerations were a little extreme. Overall though, it was a good read."
5,Eragon Rocks!!,"ERAGON is a gripping story that I think is creative, absorbing, and it gives you a sense of being in a different world, following the steps of Eragon, Brom and Saphira.Eragon is a teenaged boy livingin a time of Kings, war, dragons, elve realms and magic. Eragon is hunting along the Spine Mountains, when he comes across a blue sparkling stone, a big one at that. The stone is a mysterious item and gives Eragon the fright of his life. So begins the quest of a boy, a dragon and a storyteller.This book has a strong plot is nailbiting and very enjoyable. It empasises love, death, courage and magic.I would reccommend it for anyone over ten years old and up. Boys, girls and adults will LOVE this book, a lot!!!"
5,Eragon,This book is all about a farm boy facing the evils of his world. He finds a blue dragon egg that changes his life forever. This change brings about unrest in the empire and a whole lot of action! I highly recommend this book to all the people who are interested in fantasy.-N.H.
3,A bit too long for my taste,"My first fantasy book and I was scared that it would be hard to get into the different land and customs. To my surprise it engaged me quickly without a lot of effort.Although I enjoyed the story, the first part was quite long when I would have preferred it on the back end of the story. Overall, I enjoyed the story, but the length was a bit much."
3,Good and bad,"This is a nicely written story, but would have been much better with an original plot. It's a fairly obvious combination of Tolkien and Star Wars."
3,"Excitement, Boredom, Excitement, Boredom","Thats how I felt reading this book. There were times I really liked it and other times when I was bored. Paolini didn't pace his book very well. But he was 15 when he wrote it so you have to forgive it for some things. The biggest problem I have is how it ripped off every fantasty book out there, mainly Lord of the Rings, especially the names:Ayra-ArwenEragon-AragornI mean come on I could come up with more original names. It still has some good elements though, the characters are good for the most part. The only character that had no point was Angela.She just randomely appears wherever Eragon goes. Stalker anyone. But she could have been elimanated easily and cut down on some pages, he needs a new editor for sure.Overall its good for a 15 year old but its still flounders and dies in its own sentences and long pages. Read if your a huge fan of fantasty only."
5,the pageturner,"This was a great book to read it is a massive pageturner an exciting story with action around every corner. There are suprises, shocks, and a little fright. In eragon you meet a character who you begin to like like from the very begining. Eragon is a good long fiction book you just won't want to end."
5,Eragon book review,Eragon is an excellent book that I would recomend for a teenaged kid who likes a good fantasy read. This book is very well written a can really get a reader into the book and make you a very happy reader. Leaving you itching to reaqd the sequel. The plot flows very well and is very interesting.The many characters are very entertaining Paulini even gives the dragon a personality. The adventures will lure you in and you won't be able to set this book down until you are finished. Eragon will leave you satisfied. These are 544 pages that will intrigue you and by the end you will be very pleased with your selection of this book.
5,It's a good read!,"OK, so there are lots of similarities with other major books in the genre. So what? Is it a good read? Am I anxiously awaiting the third installment of the trilogy? I think people who think they are ""experts"" in literature get hung up on the commas and quotation marks, when the rest of the planet is enjoying the heck out of this series. Get over yourselves -- It's a fantastic read! And maybe the similarities stem from the fact that the biggies in this genre aren't very deep in themselves when it comes to plot devices and conflicts -- they all boil down to good v. evil, don't they? And Paolini goes deeper into the cultures of some of the ""races"" in the book than Tolkien ever did. Read it. You won't be disappointed."
3,everyone's a critic...,"...including myself. But, being a critic is certainly much easier than being an author--a fact that has been made all the more clear to me as I trudge through my Master's thesis. Yes, we have seen many of the same characters and plot twists before. But, does this really distract from the enjoyment of the book? No. The worst flaw I found was that the book fails to build up to one monumental apex; instead, it offers a series of smaller, less momentous episodes--all of which are enjoyable.That said, I anticipate reading published works by all those who offered such proficient critiques of this work. I assume that their abundant knowledge of fantasy will produce great works that we all will soon see in bookstores and playing in the local cinema."
2,He needs an editor . . .,". . . not a thesaurus. In the first few pages, I wanted to duck to avoid uninteresting flying adjectives. And you can't use the word ""stuff"" in a fantasy novel. And fantasy characters get sick. They do not throw up.I'm excited about the fact that this book was written by a teenager, but I don't think we should ignore the rules of style and usage (and plot) just because he's 19. There are some mature ideas in the book (e.g., Eragon's discovery of his own mortality), and some of the passages obviously thought-out (good description of a battle scene -- not easy to do), but the characters'actions are inexplicable (people show up in places with no explanation of why they are there; characters express strong emotions or sarcasm that has no connection to the content of a conversation) and the language is . . . what a 15 year old thinks a fantasy character would say. In general, the writing is distractingly unsophisticated."
5,Eragon,When I first started to read this book it immetiately started to pull me deeper into the book. In the whole book nothing just seems to be boring because something interesting always happens. I was always interested in magical creatures such as elves or dwarves but dragons! THey don't come up alot and that just makes the storymore interesting for me. After you have read the book you would just wish that the next book (Eldest) was already out!
5,dragons why not (small spoilers),This book may seem like lord of the rings but it is nothing like that. Eragon finds a polished blue stone in the forest called the spine that appears out of nowere. he keeps the stone to try to figure out what it is and eventually his egg hatches to welcome the beautiful character saphire a dragon. eragon and saphire train together to overcome the great evils of king gallbatrox and to revenge his uncle from death of the razoc. (spelling) this book is matching up to harry potter and it's the authors first book it will keep you reading for hours after hours with surprising twists. this book is worth your trouble to go down the street and get it. the second book eldest will be out on august 1st have fun with the exellent relationship between eragon and saphire you will love this book.
1,Why all the hype?,"I read ""Eragon"" as part of my own market research as a writer of teen fiction, and fail to see why it is getting praise. It's a far cry from unique, set in a fantasy world like most others. While I was interested enough to find out what happens next, the plot was never really remarkable. Plot ""twists"" are encountered with a slight nod. The psychology behind the characters is loose and some developments are sketchy (a woman on one side of the world conveniently appears on the other side of the world, and got there before Eragon, though it took him a week). And the ending...wait...that's the ending? I am reminded of my early efforts with managing long plots. I had the beginnings down, but the ends rushed to an impatient resolution. I think this book is 90% hype, and I'm not impressed that he started writing when he was 15. So did I, and while my 500-pages of amateur effort commit many of the same sins as Paolini's published work, it's a better read, and unpublished (thank god!)."
3,A Young Author with a Promising Future as a Writer!,Considering the author was fifteen when he started writing this book it is a well-written adventure. You can tell at times he is a little basic in his verbage but I think with his maturing as a author this will even out. Has a wonderful imagination and would recommend this book. Looking forward to the next installment.
1,Master Paolini? I think not.,"I have recently read some reviews by five star people in response to one star people. They make their case. He is fifteen, say the one star people. They say, Give him a break. After reading this, I have my own views on the matter. First, I admit it is very good for a teen writer. However, it is not good for a published work of fiction. I would accomadate for his flaws and agree with the five star people had he not said on his site, ""I strive for a lyrical beauty somewhere between Tolkien at his best and Seamus Heaney's translation of Beowulf."" Obviously, the publicity of this book has bloated his ego, because his writing is nowhere near that of the aformentioned authors. I can only hope that you will not fuel his vanity and purchase a copy of Eragon."
2,Not worth it. Why did I bother?,"I have not read the Lord of the Rings and many other popular fantasies, but even so I could just feel it in my bones that his book was one big fat cliche. While reading it I was thinking to myself, ""Why don't I like it, why don't I like it?"" and after doing a bit of research I found out why. Sure, I'll admit it had some exciting parts in it, sort of, but overall I do not beleive this is anything special. I had about a quarter of the book left before I finally couldn't take the torture anymore and just returned it to the library."
2,holy crap,"This is one of the worst books i have ever read. I know the author is young(i'm still younger than him tho, but my god, the writing in this novel is disgusting. I almost threw up reading it, i seriously did. Maybe it's just because i'm used to the writings of Tolkien and George R.R. Martin, but this guy really needs to learn how to write. Hopefully he'll get better and at least become as competant as Robert Jordan, but that still isn't anything to brag about."
2,unoriginal,"Hmm, this is going to be a short review because there really isn't much to say and everyone else has already said it. If you want a more childish adventurous fantasy book then this is great. Its got all the archetypical plotlines, characters, magics, and creatures you could ever want. It just has a story that is fun to read, nothing more and therefore it gets no more than two stars. I can't believe at how popular this is and that it already has a movie, kinda sad. To unoriginal. . ."
5,:) great book but this is best when read as a pre-teen or teen,"Great book. Sure it resembles other great works of fantasy but if your into Harry potter and lord of the rings but if your a kid, and this is clerly a childrens novel, who's into that kind of stuff you should have no problem ignoring all those braty revieiws by adults and loving the book series."
5,Come roaring out of the gate.,"With all the odds stacked against him Eragon flys through. Fast paced from start to finish. Great read for all ages. A hero you can't help but love. Battles, swords, and a dragon who could go wrong."
5,Rocked,"This review is going to be sweet and short.Read this book, buy it, suggest it to others.In other words, this is my way of saying that you rock, Paolini!This is my favorite book of all time.READ it!"
3,hi,"this book is pretty long but it is as good as ice cream! YAY!! u can't put it down, but techicaly u could. But it is too good. if u likey tell me...cuz i need to do a book report!! AHHHH HOMEWORK!!"
3,Eragon,"This book was ok. The story was pretty good. I really liked the characters, but I wish there was more information about their personalities and backgrounds."
3,looking forward to book #2,"Not bad at all. It's big, it rings all the expected changes, and the characters are nicely three dimensional. It is completely a novel, rather than a treatment for a screenplay. I'd like to see Mr. Paolini let his characters' confusions stand without comment. This isn't great work, but this kid has tremendous potential. I'll read the next one, and see how he develops."
1,Not as good as Harry Potter,"I love Harry Potter Books and a lot more other teen novels such as the Bronze Bow. However, this book is very dull and I agree with others who say it is a rip off from other novels. I have read five chapters and I am, not sure if I want to go on. This was said to be as good as harry potter but I think it is very poor work."
3,Considering his age..,"This is a very good book, considering the age at which it was written. I'm in agreement with others in that the poetry bit wasn't the best I've ever read.. perhaps some more creativity and thought should have been put into it. For the most part, the characters are believable.. however Brom does leave you wondering, even after the ""loose ends"" are tied up.I did find this book hard to put down, and I am looking forward to the next of this series; I'll definately read it. But I do hope it's a little better put together than this one.."
3,Entertaining Story,"This set has its endearing qualities. It borrows heavily from the fantasy genre, but within the story are good political dynamics between the factions. The author did tend to show his age specifically so with romantics relationships it tries to capture between the hero and a female elf. The voice author is fantastic. The reason I gave it three stars is because one whole chapter was inaudible. Amazon granted me a free replacement, but the same chapter same problem. Until this day I don't know what happened in that chapter."
1,Laughable,"Having read an excerpt of this travesty I must say that, while having the patience to write a book at 17 is admirable,it does not mean that said book is worth publishing and this patently isn't.Painfully derivative and crammed with embarrasingly clumsy phraseology,I can only hope that Mr Paolini looks back on this in 30 years and thinks ""Dear god, I am the luckiest man on god's green earth, that this rubbish sold so well."""
2,"Had he been much older, I doubt this would have been published.","Sure, it's good for a 17-year-old, but that doesn't make it good literature. I think I've seen fan fiction better than this.So many elements of the plot, locations, even names are almost shamelessly derived from other works of fantasy, such as 'The Lord of the Rings' and 'Star Wars'. I read this in 6th grade and, of course, loved it. Now I've gone back, re-read it, and it's almost painful, how so much of this over praised purple brick is clearly written by a kid. It's good for a 17-year-old, sure, but to me, that doesn't save it from being mediocre.Nonetheless, if he keeps this up, Paolini shows great promise at an older age. But for now, I'd much rather read Philip Pullman's 'His Dark Materials', or anything by Tolkein,instead this overrated purple brick of a fantasy novel. Kids will probably love it, but anyone older will probably be able to see through it."
3,Interesting,"This book has a nice pace. However, most of the characters are somewhat flat and the dragon could have been more involved with the story."
2,Good enough for light reading...plot was copied,"I enjoyed the book as a good lite read. When I got to the end, I realized that all the major plot elements were stolen from Star Wars. I hated the book from that point on. Paolini tends to randomly use obscure and superfluous words. Not a good technique."
4,Not a bad book,"Okay, I will admit that this book sat on my desk for MONTHS before I read it. LOTR did come to mind quite a bit as I was reading it as did Star Wars but it was still a good read and I was impressed that a 17 year old wrote it. I've read some of the reviews on here about how he's taken things from LOTR and Star Wars and I've also read reviews that the book isn't remotely like those. Eragon is pretty much LOTR and Star Wars mixed into one with a different spin on it. Now I LOVED those books, I grew up with LOTR and the Star Wars Movies and this book isn't of the same caliber as those but it's a pretty good read. I don't know how I would feel about children reading this series violence wise and stuff it reminds me of LOTR and Harry Potter."
1,Completely unoriginal,This book is completely unoriginal! I am sorry to say but there are just to many similarities between this and Lord of the Rings. He also takes ideas from a number of other books. I suggest to other readers to save their money and pass this one by. If your bored just reread Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings.
4,Great book,"This author is captivating in his detail. He is able to weave a story tangled with fun, and excitement. I cannot wait to read the next in the series."
2,"Well, at least he tried. Sort of.","I've nothing against fanfiction, and I've nothing against Star Wars, LOTR saga, the Dragonflight series, etc.I believe it is a-ok to take INFLUENCE from your favorite authors and stories.Influence, however, does not mean you take your favorite stories, chop them up, change the names of the main characters, and call it your own idea. That's fanfiction.Sure, the kid is only 17 years old, but that's no excuse for not having an original idea. Has anyone ever read the Outsiders? That was written by an 18 or 19 year old girl and had FAR more character development and more overall FEELING to the book than this did. Age is no excuse, I'm sorry.No offense intended, but the kid needs to wean himself off the fanboi-hood of his favorite sci-fi and fantasy, sit down and think about his own ideas, take a few writing classes or practice, and then try again."
1,Cover Art Is Nice,"This book is just not very original. In fact, after reading it, I got so hungry for the dragons of Pern that I am rereading that whole series (and all the offshoots). Don't bother with Eragon. Read Anne McCaffrey's Dragons of Pern series and Tolkien's Lord of the Rings instead; both of these series are far, far more intriguing and imaginative."
5,Eragon: A Book of Adventure!,"I think this book is very interesting. It has mush to do with Dragons and such that you would fined in The Lord of the Rings. It starts with a 15 year old farm boy who finds a dragon egg on a hunt in the Spine. After much investigation of the so called stone it Hatched to reveal a dragon. After the Raz'ac Kill his Uncle and destroy his house he sets out on an adventure to catch them with a story teller Brom and his Dragon Saphira. The rest is in the Book Eragon, The First book of the Inheritence."
1,Would not recommend,"I bought this book after hearing all the buzz about it. Being a huge fantasy fan, I was really excited to read it. Imagine my surpirise when I realized how much this author had ripped off some of my favorite fantasy authors including J.R.R. Tolkien, and Ursula Le Guin. He had borrowed so much material that I am surprised he was not sued for copyright infringement. The book was extremey slow moving with just a few interesting moments. I would not recommend this book. Instead I would recommend Harry Potter, Chronicles of Narnia, Hobbit, Lord of the Rings, Wizard of Earthsea."
1,"A reader from High Ridge, MO","I picked up a copy of ""Eragon"" after it received so much favorable press because it was written by some 19 year oldwunderkind, but I have to tell you: it's a clunker. I mean, it's a great effort for someone his age, but I found myself constantly thinking, ""This isn't bad.....for a 15 year old."" I finally gave up after reading almost 100 pages. The writing is highly derivative and the characters are not well realized, but it's a story that a 10 or 12 year old might enjoy. I was irritated by cutesy affectations such as his referring at one point to a dragon named ""Bid'Daum."" Anyone read ""Dune"" lately, and recognize that as Muad'Dib spelled backwards? I do not appreciate that kind of distraction when I'm reading, and I kept wondering what other references I might be missing. The author shows a great deal of talent and potential, however, and I will be interested to see what he does in about 10 or 20 years."
1,Do yourself a favor. Read something better.,"As you look around at the other, glowing reviews of Eragon, I hope you realize one thing: They are wrong.Paolini somehow got a glorified fan-fiction published-by his parents-and then miraculously found a ""big time"" publisher who knew how many people could be duped into reading a ""fresh and original fantasy""Paolini plagiarizes:Lord of the RingsStar WarsEarthseaThe BelgariadFreaking Jeremy Thatcher, Dragon Hatcher!He takes classics, rips them apart, and creates a Literary Frankenstine. This book is the greatest rape of literature I have ever seen, and should never seen the light of day."
4,Eragon,Great storyline - fantasy readers won't be disappointed. The movie doesn't do the book justice.
5,Great Book,"Great book, ends so that you can't wait for the 2nd. THe 2nd and 4th books are good as well. The third book was just OK. Pretty decent series though."
2,Too much time spent on this story.,"Very impressed with the writing and descriptive ability of young Mr. Paolini, however it took me forever to get through this story. I felt like I was as old as Brom yet happy when I finally finished. It seemed the author was trying to prove something to get this to 500 pages. He didn't need to. The same story with the same flavor could have been told on less paper."
1,Bad book,I am nine years old and I fonud some things in this book that I did't like. This kid copyed off of a lot of books. Eragon's sword is five foot one-handed sword that is heavy. Brom the wizard is a cheep imitation of Gandlf in the LOTR. And nobody knows why the battle happened but it just Happened. His story could have fit in one book. This kid did not know anything about swordsmenship. This book sould have never been published.
4,This is a well written and carefully thought out book,"I am a great fan of Science Fantasy. This book delivers in such a charming way that I passed it on to my two daughters, aged 13 and 20, who also have enjoyed the book. This author has a long career ahead of him. Any child who even thinks of writing should read Eragon. This book is getting a lot of Word of Mouth advertising in my area. Adults and children are finding it and passing it on to others. This is a must read."
4,Copy-cat,"Overall I thought Eragon was a pretty good book. I liked the way Paolini described the land, people, and dragons. Although, he needs to learn to be more original. I can see getting your inspiration from a book (The Lord of the Rings) but this is just taking it too far. Paolini is obviously talented so he should use his talent and creat something of his own!Eragon needs to stop being so inquisitive. Some of his questions that are needed to describe things could be answered through the story instead of by the characters. The story has an okay plot line and I am eager to see where it takes Eragon. But advice for Paolini on future books, use your imagination and do something original! It's easy to imitate other books but it takes talent to come up with something new."
3,Full of highs and lows,"I received this book as a Christmas gift, and although I'm normally attracted to such fantastical sounding novels, Eragon sat under my tree for a while after the 25th. When I finally resorted to the book after boredom overtook me, I wasn't impressed. Halfway through I was still tempted to drop it. It didn't keep my interest for its lack of originality, and the reading level wasn't what I had expected. For younger/lower-level readers, this would probably make a lovely gift; however, I saw too many links to other writers and not enough of what I enjoy in a decent fantasy novel."
1,Eragon is cubic zirconia,"After hearing this book built up as the next coming of Tolkien, I was disappointed and disturbed to actually read it. It was like being invited to a party and told that there would be an amazing diamond on display, only to find cubic zirconia. There's a little bit of sparkle here and there, but the sparkle is all easily recognizable as having been taken from elsewhere--WHEEL OF TIME, DRAGONRIDERS, and, of course, LOTR. Etc. It's kind of disturbing that so many people seem to be fine with that. I presume that many don't know because they haven't read Robert Jordan etc? What's good about this book is imitation, and what's so-so and even boring about it is the way it's written. Anyway, this is cubic zirconia being passed off as diamonds, and it isn't worth the hype it's been getting."
2,Nuff Said,Okay...keeping this short and simple. Same old reused tired plot. Writting could be alot better and the story could have been stitched together probably much better. Characters do not have a good balance with each other. Not really suspenseful since we've all seen this story before (just with different characters). BUT it's a okay good book for kids to read if they really can't get into Lord of the Rings. I would say this would be a replacement book for kids that are around 10-16 who can't understand or get into Lord of the Rings.
4,I enjoyed this book,"More than a few of the reviews I've read about this book had almost discouraged me from giving ""Eragon"" a chance. I am glad now that they did not.I am a person who loves to read a good story. I like what I like and I have to say that it was far more enjoyable for me to read this book than many of the big name authors Mr. Paolini has been accused of mimicking. Original storylines and plots are so rare these days, that I suspect that they might actually be extinct.What this young author has done for me though, is to present a story that I enjoy reading. It doesn't matter that it may share similarities with another author's stories. I will simply have to take the critics' word for it, because the other authors in question could not hold my interest long enough for me to finish any of their ""original"" works of literature.So I thank this young author for giving me an enjoyable read. Who knows, maybe I will actually give the other, more established, writers another chance because him."
5,Finally!,"It's been awhile since i read a book this good. I read some ok ones, but this is an awsome one! I love how you get warped into the story when you start reading it, and i want to say, that there isn't another book i have seen that combines dragons and magic so well. But i am only 8, and i still have a lot more time to read! All in all, this was a great book. I can't wait for the next one!"
4,Got My Daughter Reading Fanatically,"Harry Potter didn't do it. Finally I found an out of print book, Under Plum Lake, and it got her reading on her own more. But when her cousin gave her Eragon, she hasn't stopped since! She loved it and is gobbling up more sci-fi and fantasy books, and even reading more non-fiction. She's unstoppable! I even read Eragon, because she kept talking about it so much, and she read me parts of it. I thought that the action was a bit quick and underdeveloped, but heh- it didn't damage her mentality, and it got her avidly reading!"
1,unbelievable,"I know, I know. I'm supossed to ""suspend disbelief"" when I read fantasy and I really tried for this book. But suspension of disbelief can only go so far. I can't believe that Eragon can fight so well with broken ribs or that he can become a master swordsman in a few months. Nor can I believe that Saphira can be so wise and motherly when she spent the past few centuries in an eggshell. It's these impossibilities that make the characters seem unreal and kill any connection I could have felt for them."
5,Just Great,"This is a book is great and I belive that all the fans of this kind of tale wont regret it. Is the kind of book you can fall in love, and once you read it your body will shout for more."
4,"Enjoyable,but nothing original","My kids have both books, including an autographed copy of Eldest. A lot of kids stood in line at a local store to get it signed by him.both, when you read them, will remind you of Lord of the rings (tolkien),and The Dragon stories of Anne Mcaffrey.Still, this generation of kids have not read Anne Mcaffrey, so they enjoy these books. I did too, but can't say I've found anything original in them."
1,WAY too long and unorginal...,500 pages? It's no wonder how they were able to cut it into a 100 minute movie. The only semi exciting thing that ever happened was when the dragon hatched. It was also a rip-off of Lord of the Rings. Urgals were like Orcs. Raz'zac were like Ringwraiths. Brom was like Gandalf. Arya was like Arwen. Murtagh was like Aragorn. Galbatorix was like Sauron. And Eragon was like Frodo (except stupid).So if you're looking for an exciting and original read. Look elsewhere.
3,Unoriginal,"This book has many cliches, which are very evident. I think that it has a combination of several aouther's writing, including the First and maybe third book in the EarthSea Trilogy, the Elinuim, a lot of ""Dragon"" genered books and many others. I did not enjoy it very much."
5,Favorite,This is the best book I have ever read. It was a well written book and fast paced. I couldn't put it down.
3,~~~EARTHSEA~~~,"My friend reccomended this book to me, saying it was the greatest book she ever read. So I began to read it, and this is my opinion - it is 'fair,' nothing wonderful about it, just fair. I will admit I am only half-way done, but I believe that is enough. Now, I am not a Lord of the Rings fan, but I am an avid Le Guin, Alexander, Weis, and De Lint fan. I can see where he got the dragon riders from (Pern), but it was Eragon's concept of magic that PISSED me off.The concept of magic is EXACTLY THE SAME in Earthsea as it is in Eragon! Only, Ms. Le Guin expresses her creation intelligently, clearly, and well-thoughtout, while 'Master' Paolini describes it through confusing dialogue.May Earthsea Live Forever!And that is my review,Ta'ta!"
5,The Best Book!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I would give this book 10000000000000000 stars if I could! It is sad, exciting and happy. It takes place in Alagaesia. It is magical. There are elves, secret tunnels,dwarves and dragons. Eragon is a great book that is good for all ages. I know this because first I read it and then my dad did. Final word, this book will enchant you!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Mediocre and unoriginal.,"I give the author a bit of credit for his age, but other than that, this book does not deserve the press it has received. He takes from other works (Star Wars, Tolkien, etc) , almost to the point of embarrasment. The story becomes tedious after awhile, but does gain a bit of momentum at the end.Perhaps the second book is better than the first."
1,I really wanted to like this book,"Really, I wanted to like it. That's why I kept reading. But ultimately, an editor needed to sit him down and tell him to take it down a notch. Or two. It was soooo overwritten and totally unoriginal. I got the feeling that Paolini is used to everyone defering to his superior intellect and that nobody around him had the sense or the heart to tell him his book was crap. It took me days to plod through it."
1,Unoriginal Doesn't Even Begin To Describe It,"I was suckered into buying this because I bought into the hype that it was Potter-esque with LOTR trappings. I should have read the reviews first, because the ones here that call it derivative are right on target. I hated to slam the book after I first read it because it was written by an adolescent, but oh how it shows. There are much finer books for the target age range to be enjoying than this hacked together bit of fluff. Don't waste your time."
1,A junk car,"I remember reading an interview with Paolini where he said that even positive reviews missed the point of his book. Dragon Quill is one of these reviewers. Unlike what Dragon Quill said earlier, Eragon WAS meant to be a literary classic. After all, Paolini compares his book to actual literary classics on his website. To use DQ's car metaphor, Eragon was meant to tear up the road but barely made it out of the garage."
2,Paolini the copycat,"Paolini obviously had no idea what he was doing when he wrote this book. All of his characters were simply copied from real masterpieces. Like The Lord of the Rings. I know not everyone can be as great as Tolkein, but if you're going to duplicate his work please try to at least put some of your own passion into the story. Real artists have their own way of thinking. Rowling,lewis,and Tolkein were the first authors of their kind and we should praise them not amatuers like Paolini. Thank You MaryAnn from Texas."
1,"I'm disappointed in Amazon for not having a ""zero star"" option","There aren't enough words to express how miserable Christopher Paolini's novel is. There aren't enough synonyms for ""bad"" to more easily translate to you, visitors of Amazon, the awful writing, plotting, characterization, prose, thematic and stylistic concerns of this book. In fact, there aren't enough enough ways to show the overall immaturity of the book's fans who cannot stand to have their Bible marked as anything less than incredible and awe-inspiring literature.I won't even try.I urge you, turn somewhere else for a decent read. You won't find it here."
3,Almost a great book,"When I first saw the book, I was somewhat skeptical. I don't read many books with dragons and elves, but I must admit that this one was worth reading. Mr. Paolini does a good job of develolping the character's personalities, though at times he spends too much effort trying to make some of his characters' backgound more mysterious than it ought to be. I was also disappointed in the level of action in the book, but if you like Lord or the Rings, where a 10 minute scene takes up 40 minutes of film, you will not be bothered. The storyline, however, is good and you can actually see the scenes he describes. I like a book where I can see and feel the surroundings. You will suspect long before the end that this is just the first book in a series, but the finish is good, tying up the storyline well. All-in-all this author's first book is good, but I doubt I would buy another one; unless he writes about something else. As I said, I don't read many books with dragons and elves."
3,"Took awhile to get, but it got here","It took twice as long as 2 other books I ordered the same day, but it got here fine."
5,7 Laws,I love the way Deepak explains the universal laws in modern terms.My 9 year old daughter enjoyed it too.
3,The book is better...,"This may be effective if you've never encountered Dr. Chopra's work before, but I found it more than somewhat cloying and insipid. I'm a huge fan (and own practically all) of Dr. Chopra's work. I'm a less-than-avid fan of Olivia Newton John (whose music is inescapable in this production -- I appreciate her accomplishments on a hard journey, just not her music). Having been completely blown away by his previous DVD, ""How to Know God,"" I was really looking forward to this one, but having also read -- and heard the audio version -- of 7 Spiritual Laws, I was frankly appalled by the mediocre production values and limp and materialistic dramatizations. No transcendence here. Again I say: READ THE BOOK, LISTEN TO THE AUDIO VERSION if you really want to receive the message in its highest form. Also, watch How to Know God for a really transcendent experience. (Blessings to Dr. C, Oliva N-J and everyone involved...)"
2,review,"Ordered size 32, received size 52. When returned the item I initially ordered was no longer available."
4,The watchers of the plains a Tale of the West ..,"Really enjoyed this book. The story flows well. The characters developed through the story , and kept my interest. I want to read more by Cullum."
1,Waste of money,There are No additional scenes. It's just a lot of packaging. It was a Major disappointment. Don't waste your money.
3,"Good, but...","It's like someone tore a hole in the movie. So much is missing. I was looking forward to ***spoiler alert*** Dudley with his tongue at 4 feet, Weasley's Wizard Wheezes, S.P.E.W, Ludo Bagman, The Quidditch World Cup, the Sphinx. They made a whole bunch of other scenes longer, so long that it was unnecessary. For example, the dragon? Perhaps they just made that scene longer for excitement, but really, I think they should have cut those short and added some much needed other scenes.I have to admit, the special effects were great, and they looked very realistic. I know it must have been hard to squeeze in all those events in a mere 2 hours and a half, but in my opinion, I think they could've done better. I hope the 5th (in which the book is my least favorite) will turn out better. If you watch movie in itself, it's pretty good, but if you are a reader, like me, then you might be...no, scratch that...WILL be severely disappointed."
1,Awful! What a disappointment!,"I was incredibly disappointed with this film! Goblet of Fire is my favorite book of the series, but the movie absolutely massacred the story! Most of Rita Skeeter's storyline was cut, the maze at the end was a joke, and the Dursleys' were left out altogether! This is a perfect example that a hastily slapped-together movie is simply no substitution for a fantastic book. Sadly, there were be tons of people who will see this film and skip the book, and will never experience how wonderful the book truly is."
3,mi opinión,"Muy buenos efectos, pero en el argumento me quedó faltando algo hacia el final de la película. Como que terminara a las carreras, sin un tratamiento claro del desenlace de la historia"
3,"Honestly, the book is better than the movie...","I must say before I write this review, I have to give the people who made this movie alot of credit because they worked so hard to make it possible. If you have ever read the book you probobly understand where I'm coming from. As I watched the movie for the first time, I kept asking myself where are certain characters fo example, ""Winky"" and ""Dobby"" the houseelves. And towards the end they skipped major scenes like the riddle."
4,Great Book Good Movie,This is a good movie and I bought it after I read the books. I would reccomend to read the books 1st and then watch the movies.
3,"Great Film, but Spring for the Special Edition","I am a huge fan of both the Harry Potter books and the movies. This is a truly fantastic film, and it does live up to the book (although of course they couldn't fit everything in, the book was massive). However, the main reason I'm writing this review is to point out that if you're a Harry Potter fan you'll definitely need to spring for the two disk special edition. This edition has just the movie and that's it, absolutely no special features whatsoever (that's why I gave this only 3 stars, the movie itself is clearly at least 4). If you're looking for those added features, definitely go for the special edition set, this edition includes nothing but the movie."
1,taking the shaft,"How far is Hollywood going to go? Now there isnt even dvd extras on the dvd?! It was bad enough when they started charging for a full screen edition and a widescreen edition. Now this??? Hollywood- listen to this- your just (...)people off, stop shafting your customers- and you wonder why people invented file sharing. i hope they get the best of ya! As for the movie, in the theater it was ok but it was lacking any flow. The third movie definately was better."
4,Wish it had the DVD with it,"I was going to buy this series in Blu-ray only, but now that most other Blu-rays have come out with DVD combos, I know why. The convenience of taking it with you. I have purchased two HP Blu-rays but we can only watch them at home. I think I'm going to hold out for a combo pack before I purchase any other Blu-rays. Great movie if you like Harry Potter though!"
1,Nothing new except the one hour documentary,"Buying this was a waste of money as there is no extended version which is the only reason I bought the first 2 ultimate editions. After watching the documentary, it seems that there is a fair amount of it that is recycled from previous behind the scenes material and that sort of thing. Save your money!!"
1,Disappointed about Ultimate 3 and 4 are not extended versions,"I pre-ordered both the ultimate editions of Harry Potter movies 3 and 4 believing they would be the extended versions like movies 1 and 2. They are NOT the extended versions. Why they give the extended version for 1 and 2, but not 3 and 4 is beyond me. Almost seems like a trick with 1 and 2 to get you to buy 3 and 4.No matter what the reason, bad show WB for treating your customers this way.I only hope I can still return them after I broke the seal wrapping.If you want the extended versions --- do NOT buy these, you will only get the original version."
5,Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,Great movie. Will never tire of Harry Potter. Looking forward to additional Harry Potter movies.
4,Not the Best - But Good,"Somehow, I feel that the director didn't quite get it right. I agree that they should focus on the mundane aspects of the kids' lives, but there's almost no magic except in the major suspense scenes. Personally, I thought Azkaban was the best of the movie adaptations. Somehow, I just thought the script was better written. And, most importantly, I just love Cuáron's visual style. Admittedly, though, I've always had a bias toward art films, and that's what he primarily does. Anyway, Goblet of Fire isn't quite as good as it could be, but still well worth the money."
2,Did the producers even read the book?,"This is BY FAR the worst of all four. I sincerely hope the fifth movie is better. If it isn't, I might have to write to the director and tell them that they might as well not waste any more money on a sixth. They sure wasted a lot on this one."
2,"Visually great, muddy plot.","This movie looks great, but I really had no idea what the plot was about. Who the heck is Barty Crouch Junior?Th weakest of the series."
3,"Not Bad, but not Good","You're probaby thinking is this kid nuts for rating this awesome movie three stars? No, I'm not crazy, because it's true. Warner Brothers has done it again, taking a excellent book by J. K. Rowling and making a crappy movie out of it. I read the Harry Potter books and I was disappointed with this movie. They cut out the Dursleys, Hermione's petition against having House Elves, Winky(Barty Couch's house elf), a certain beetle(read the last chapter where Hermione is clutching a jar with a beetle in it), and a death that should have taken place. They honestly could have done better with this movie. I have the first three movies. I love the first two, but once you get to Prisoner of Azkaban, the magic begins to crumble. So, if I were you, I would only get the movie because of Voldemort(He Who Must Not Be Named). He was the best thing that came out of this movie.Rock On!!"
3,another year at school,"They seem along with J.K. Rowling seem to be turning these sequels out at record rate.Magic is fun for kids?From the UFO stuff in the 60' through 80's I realize that what seems ""harmless"" funto the more intelligent can be a trap for the less preceptiveand simple?Sure, I like these movies and seeing the characters grow upon the screen, but the problems of this being a sort of modern Buck Rogersserial of full length movies is one that we will have to deal with down the road.I just saw the last one out on dvd over Christmasand the villain's personality is split into 7 parts:each of which it seems will be killed in froth coming books and movies.That plot device will keep this going past 2017 and make Rowlingas rich as the Beatles?"
1,Is this a bootleg copy?,"I ordered this to replace a missing copy for our home collection. The HP movies are our favorites, and we watch them often. I loaned Goblet to someone, can't remember who, and it's been more than a year. I finally decided to admit it's not coming home, and ordering a new one. Unfortunatly, you get what you pay for here. I was excited to find a coopy for around five dollars (and didn't think twice about it, since Blue Ray is becoming popular, and it's an older movie now) but when we watched it last week, the DVD plays, but skips and catches every 10 minutes or so and the picture looks 'off'. I haven't bothered trying to replace it, since it was only a few dollars, but I will be looking for a real copy soon."
5,Haryr Potter is the best!,"If you are a Harry Potter fan with a Blu-Ray player, You need to buy all the Harry Potter movies. I love the detail that you don't see until you have seen it on Blu-Ray. It's like seeing it for the first time! The only thing that would make it better would be a 2 disc collector's edition or something."
5,great,"I was very satisfied with my purchase from this company, and of course, the movie is incredible too! I never purchase dvd's in stores anymore."
3,"Get the Two-Disc Special Edition, All this has is the film.","Contrary to what others may tell you, all this copy has is the Film itself, nothing more, nothing less. If you truely want a good copy, get the two-disc special edition. It has far more materieal, including Deleated Scenes! So just spend a few dollars more and get more."
3,GOF not POA,"I agree with the previous reviewer. Prisoner of Azkaban, in my opinion was the best book in the Harry Potter series and the POA movie was the best one in the series so far. The POA movie was magical(sic) and stunning. Michael Cuaron was great at handling the difficult ""Time Travel"" concept and made the movie extremely enjoyable.Goblet of Fire on the other hand looks like an express train only intent on arriving at its destination with no time for passing sceneries. Everything except the Yule ball and the tournaments are a fast blur and I particularly felt the rushed script kind of took away the essence of the movie. Snape, Draco, Sirius and even Skeeter are just for scene fillers with nothing much to do. Gambon is unconvincing as Dumbledore. I feel that the director could have handled the movie more creatively.That said, the DVD is great."
3,Not as good,"I dont really hate this movie but the fact that they skipped over so much stuff makes me think that they are slacking.They decided to change the movie around so it was not being based off the book that much. Sure the ending was true to the book, but they could have made the movie so much better if they completely followed the book.One question- Where the heck is Dolby?? haha when i watched that part i started to disslike the movie.Not the best movie they made. They need to pick up the slack."
5,A Passing Resemblance to JKR Goblet of Fire,"Great effects and action scenes. You get the Qudditch World Cup, the Yule Ball and the Tournament, but the rest of the JKR story is not even touched upon. I was looking forward to seeing the ""cool"" Bill Weasley with the fang earring, Ludo Baggmann and Charlie Weasley. But even Mrs. Weasley and Percy were left out of this movie, along with the Dursley's. Barty Crouch Jr should never have been introduced as a character in the beginning. A confession under veritaserum at the end of the movie would have better explained his actions."
1,Big Disapointment,"Be ready for a BIG disappointment if you are expecting to see the expanded versions of the movies. Neither movie in this latest ""Ultimate Edition"" release contain any of the extented scenes that we were anticipating as a result of the inclusion of expanded scenes in the first two releases. I would not have ordered these versions if I had known that neither this version or its companion contained any expanded scenes. I already have Blu-Ray copies of the movies, why would I want additional copies if there is nothing different between them?"
2,Doesn't get the prize,"Even though it's better than Potter 1 and 2, sadly it's still a pale imitation of the book. If you see it before you read the novel, you'll never know what all the fuss is about. Gone is the magic, the humor, the suspence. What's left? Overacting, decent F/X, and no character development whatsoever."
4,Ultimate Edition Needs More,"If you're a Harry Potter fan, you will love the extras like the photo album and ""making of"" videos. However, I expected that volumes 3 and 4 would include an extended version like volumes 1 and 2, but they did not. If I can see the extended version on ABC Family Channel, then I should get that version in an ""ultimate"" edition."
4,Music to my ears!,I purchased the ultimate edition expecting it to be like the first two. It was disappointing to discover there was only one disc of special features that I had not seen before. Fortunately this disc contained the most exciting information in regards to the sound and music production throughout all of the Harry Potter movies. This insight into the production of the movie was fascinating and I highly recommend the ultimate edition simply for the wealth of knowledge the sound and music production provided.
1,The worst Harry Potter movie,"I liked the 3 other movies before this one. I found this one to be totally uninspiring and boring. I don't read the books, so I don't consider myself a hardcore fan, but as a casual observer who just wants some entertainment, this didn't do anything for me. I own the other movies, but I don't think I'm going to invest in this one. Didn't like it at the theater, so what's the point?"
2,Wiccan or not?,"I'm not a fan of these films. I just don't ""get"" them. I suppose the writing is wonderful. The novels are as popular as air, I can't seem to get through those either. It seems these films render one in a trance, an unescapable one. I've never been drawn in. I WANT to be entertained by these films. I truly do. But this film does NOT! It's horrible. It's just too infantile. This film droned on for near to three hours. Even William Friedkin and Blatty edited ""Exorcist"" for the screen. A novel this long? Lord, I can't seem to find an escape from this boredom. The young adult love is nauseating at best. The ONLY good point to this film is it's set design. To compare this film to ""Wizard Of Oz"" is absurd. ""Oz"" cannot be compared to ""Hogbore""."
2,Go read the book rather than watch this,The movies have been steadily going downhill...this was BAD. I love the books and this was simply terrible. This one leaves so much out that the flow is very jerky and makes no sense unless you have read the book. It also leaves out all the set up information that is necessary for the next few books. Plus we never see the characters learning anything...Harry just seems to know how to do the new spells. This is definitely a huge disappointment and not worth your time.
1,I think the Director Needs Some Lessons from Peter Jackson,I am a Harry Potter fan. The movie was absolutely terrible. It did not seem to have a natural flow. It seemed as though you nodded off and woke up to something you missed. Rent to see it but if you are not a fan - do not waste your money.
3,It's not one of my favorites,"I've seen the movie, I've never owned it. It follows the book, which was enjoyable. However, I found the book, better then the movie. There is one scene, that sounds better in the book, then it looks in the movie, In the movie, I found it very inappraote and wish they would have warned us on the rating for ""some sensality""."
3,good,"It's not as good as the first 3 years of Potter. It's not as cohesive and as they grow older, the 3 stars' accents are harder to understand. But, good."
5,Excelente!!!,"Soy una gran fanática de la serie, y recomiendo ampliamente el Blu ray, la imágen es impresionante y el sonido ni se diga. No puede faltar en su colección!"
2,Sloppy Presentation,I have all 4 Harry Potter DVDs and I have no complaints whatsoever as far as the movies is concerned. What really bothers me is the presentation... why are the first two DVDs packaged one way and the second two packaged in a different way? ... and this last one didn't even have a menu insert! Very inconsistent presentation throughout the series... what will #5 be...? A Digipack? Shame on Warner Brothers!
5,Excellent Value,"The movie is excellent and full of adventure. The games and extra goodies are on the second disc which is good. Many sales are only one disc from the department stores, but this set is perfect!"
5,Classic,Some of the reviews I read talked about major problems with typos and structure in the kindle version. I only noticed 2 or 3 minor typos.
