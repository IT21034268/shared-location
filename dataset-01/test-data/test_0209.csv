2,I hate that I didn't love this book,"I am a big fan of the Anita blake series and was actually lucky enough to meet Laurell Hamilton at a reading of A Kiss of Shadows. She previewed this book and I was very excited about reading it, but was disappointed at the end of the read. Anita has gotten progressively darker in her books as the series has progressed, but the wanton sexcapades that ran thru this book seemed more like a continuation of the Meredith Gentry series than Anita Blake. She has basically accepted the fact that she has lost her morality, which was actually something that she used to hold in high regard. She has become a very unlikeable character and that troubled me quite a bit because I have really enjoyed the previous stories and her adventures. ... I am hoping that the next book is different, because after I finished this book I wasn't real excited about continuing the series."
1,ugh,I had to read this in high school as part of our summer reading program. I will always remember this book as the WORST book I've ever read. It makes no sense and just when you start to think you understand what's going on it's all turned upside down and you're left without a clue.
4,I am the Cheese,I thought it was a great book. I was really confused throughout the book but what happened at the end made it all make sense. The best part of the book was that there was a new surprize around every corner. The main charachter goes through a lot of weird events. I would definetely give this book to other people to read.
3,It Was Really Good.... Until The End,"While I was reading this book, I thought it was great. The book had a good character, a good story, and a good climax, but when you reach the end, it really leaves you hanging. You expect all the loose ends (which there are ton of them) to be tied up. But instead the ending just leves you more confused. I recommend this book to anyone who likes to think hard and doesn't get dissapointed easily."
2,Confusing Yet Interesting,"Although I liked this book, I felt that it was rather hard to follow and a bit confusing. The plot of the book was good yet Cormier needed to make a clearer image for his readers. Cormier wrote a very creative novel but He just needed to expand a little to make the book more understandable. I also felt that a few of the characters needed a little more description. I do have to admit parts of the book were exilerating and kept me on the edge of my seat. The book did have a lot of twists and turns which kept the readers alive. Altogether I thought this would have been a great book if Cormier worked on it a little more. I think the book would appeal to readers with more of an imagination and who would take the time to think about the book."
4,A great book,"Robert Cormier did a great job on writing this book. ""I am the Cheese"" is a great book that makes you think which you don't encounter often. It is full of suspense and drama. It is confusing at times but at the end it all comes together. The book was so interesting it was hard to stop reading. My favorite part is at the end when the title comes into play. I would recommend this book to any mature reader who likes suspense and drama."
4,Interesting and melancholic,"I am the Cheese is a story told through flashbacks in three parts. First, the psychiatrist interviews the protagonist, Adam Farmer, to unearth his lost memories; then long periods of remembrance where Adam talks about his past; and finally his trip to a hospital to see his father. All three sections meet and make complete sense at the end where he arrives at the hospital where he had the interview, where he ends off describing the event that has left him so traumatised."
4,The Cheese I Am,"By Alex Relph, Chad Kerley, Maddie Taylor, Isaac Gomez, and Sky NicholsI Am The Cheese by Robert Cormier, is an excellent book for both male and female teenagers. A boy's struggle to find the truth about his life, takes him back to a place in the past that perhaps he shouldn't remember. It all starts when he takes a fall on his bike and it all comes back to him. As it may have been confusing at times to switch back from reality to him having discussions with his therapist, it becomes a nice refreshment from a normal story. You go along with the character to uncover his real identity. The book leaves you asking questions which we personally did not like, but does fall in the category of a mystery thriller. It is a good story and his suitable for adrenaline junkies. So read it for yourself!!"
2,"I am the Cheese, makes me very pleased!","The book called I am the Cheese, by Robert Cormier. It is am amazing book that I have read over the past few weeks. The story is based on a boy searching on a bicycle to find his father, and a desperate journey through the mind to unlock the secret past. As his search progresses through the chill October night, Adam remembers a happy childhood marred only by small memories: his parents' whispered conferences, their sudden midnight move to a new house, the strange man in the gray suit. But it is the past that must not be remembered if Adam wants to survive.It throws you off until something unbelievable happens next. It made me really want to get up and eat some cheese. This was a very good book that I just randomly picked out of the library. I have never read such an adventurous book in my life. He reaches for the truth that hovers over him at the edge of his mind- and he brings the truth to a shattering end."
3,chris and muzza's reveiw,"The book was ok but a little confusing because it was hard to follow the hole story but some parts of the book were ok like the part where the boy found out he had two birth certificates, and also when he kisses amy"
2,"How many stars, please.","While somewhat useful as a general guide to London restaurants and prices, this directory would serve the visitor better with some subjective ratings of the usual one to five star variety. Most tourists want to know where the good grub is at a good price. Aside from a couple of references, this book doesn't really tell you."
4,Corporate Reality,"In a fast reading, intriguing and all too possible tale of Corporate greed and its' consequences, the author lays out an insider's determination to seek the truth. Written with first hand experience in the field, the author blends the publicly stated highly principled goals of a very large pharmaceutical company with the selfish and costly personal ambitions of its' top executives. Under a cloud of a possible murder, the suspicious executive, a prime benefactor of the death, wrestles with the tasks of his new position while satisfying his own curiosity and at the same time taking respite in illicit sex at the expense of his own family. Mr. Potter brings it all to a conclusion that just as in real life leaves the reader wondering what will happen now. I look forward to Mr. Potter's next book."
4,Nice train set,Bought this train set for my Christmas village. Works nice. Good price. I was able to even combined it with my current train set and make it larger.
2,Adiosito Corazon,"I have been following the career of Paulin Rubio for a while. I have seen her grow with each CD, however, I think she has reached her peak. The cd is good by not great.. It left me wanting more.. I only found 2 track that me say hmmm?"
4,Wonderful story,"I'm not here to write a mini-novel about the film. I thought it was great though. I loved the concept, the characters, the cinematography and the story. A beautiful tale about a remarkable duo, who draw from each other - strength, love and bravery. I loved it and I highly recommend it, although not really for those right-of-center."
1,"Low quality sounds, horrible program interface","I am very disappointed with this collection of sound clips. Most are short, of low quality, and contain a lot of hiss or other noise. Many of the sounds are not isolated, as if they were lifted from a TV show and you can hear other sounds in the background. Some are not really sound effects, just someone speaking gibberish. You can only export the sounds as WAV files, and you can only export them one at a time, which makes it extremely tedious to add these sound effects to your project or your own sound organizer, like iTunes. You must keep the CD in the computer to access the sounds, which again makes it cumbersome to use. The search and play interface is terrible and very amateurish, like it was written by a high-school student on a weekend. The only positive I can say is that it does contain a wide variety of sounds."
3,A good read,"I have really enjoyed the Mediator series with Susannah Simon. The books blend mystery, a ghost story, romance, and suspense! I usually read author, Sherry A. Mauro but this writer is just as good. Now I want to read ""The Princess Diaries"""
5,AMAZING!,I love the whole series and I recommend it for anyone ages 11 and up. Meg Cabot is my favorite author and this book WOW'd me more than any other book I've read by her! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
3,Yes it's Propaganda - But Also a Great History Lesson,"The seven films which comprise Frank Capra's WHY WE FIGHT are classic examples of wartime propaganda. But it's important to remember that the United States were one of the ""Good Guys"" in World War II. These films were mandatory viewing for members of the U.S. Armed Forces during WWII intending to give them perspective and reason for why their country was asking them to risk their lives in a foreign war. They depict Hitler, Mussolini and Tojo as evil men bent on world domination and frankly, history has never proven otherwise. It's also fascinating to see how the U.S. was on the same side as Communist Russia and soon-to-be Communist China during WWII, prior to the Cold War which followed. Essential viewing for World War II buffs and scholars."
3,Interesting but not good value.,"While the content of these videos is very interesting and informative. The quality of the footage needs a little bit to be desired. Remember, this is not a documentary!!!! These films were made as propaganda films and should be viewed as such. While many of the facts contained in the films are accurate, they are a little biased, but that's what to expect from propaganda films.As a part of history, I think these films are valuable. They are certainly worth watching (but as I said before, not as a documentary). I think they are a little overpriced for what you get."
5,Really unique book,"Slywotzky and Morrison characterize winning businesses and how they developed ""profit zones"" in their businesses. A profit zone is apparently an aspect of a business design which is the source for the value creation within that company. Like Charles Schwab's One Source. Intels' first to market system, etc. Each zone is characterized and explained. These zones, theoretically, could be replicated in other industries, and potentially could be as successful. I think it's a very unique way of looking at businesses. I haven't much thought of businesses in terms of zones of profit and industry patterns. This really was an illuminating book for me, and I'd highly recommend it."
1,"After only using it once, this one got shelved","Compare with 'Back Pain Relief Today with Dr. Art Ulene', this one is hard to follow and each workout did not hit the point like Dr. Art Ulene's instructed. Also, Dr. Arthur White's comment or explaination should be placed in the front of the tape in stead of at end of the program. After only using it once, this one got shelved.."
3,Gift,The quality of the lense was suspect as it was hard to focus. But I also gave a inexpensive one from the hardware store that worked better.
1,Can't see a thing,"This product got great reviews so I bought it for my granddaughters for Christmas. The optical quality is nil. You might as well put a bug under any piece of plastic. I dont recommend this product. Too bad. The design and idea is great but due to poor optical quality, it doesn't do a thing."
3,Wallace's Ghost,"As I was coming to the end of this book I came across the sentence ""Many sociologists (and a few biologists) hope for a comparative anatomy of the mind; but that can never succeed.""Jones thinks ""the human intellect stands alone"".He gives no good reasons for this, but states it anyway, shades of Alfred Russel Wallace. Why should scientists give up hope for understanding the evolution of the human brain from an evolutionary perspective? Does the books dedication provide us with an answer? ""To Dick Lewontin, who showed me what evolution can and cannot explain.""The previous review by CW is right on, saying the Origin is clearer. And I agree with mturks review that there is a lack of clarity in ""Darwin's Ghost"".If you want to read the Origin, it is slow going, maybe worth it, but you will only learn part of what is now known.My recommendations for an update of Darwin are Ernst Mayrs ""One Long Argument""(1991) and ""What Evolution Is"" (2001) for lucid and non-technical treatments."
3,Interesting,Interesting read. a little fantastical. I was referred to me by a relative. If you are into the supernatural and black magic it will be interesting. My interest has since shifted. So I have passed it on. Kowledge is power.
5,Excellent follow-up to L&T 2000,"Having come-off a huge hit (2000 remake of the classic ""Loops & Tings"" by Jens) with remixes by Humate and Anastasia, Lady Tom returns with another sure-fire trance track. The remixes provided on the single include Marc Van Linden, Lady Tom, Plug 'N Play, and (Tomasso) De Donatis. Marc Van Linden's is the weakest of the bunch, managing not to stray far from his ""L&T"" mix. Lady Tom's mix is the most accessible, an excellent track bordering hard-trance. The best two by far are the Plug 'N Play and De Donatis (aka, one of the two guys behind DJ Quicksilver) mixes. Plug 'N Play's isn't as hard as previous releases and they demonstrate their skills. De Donatis' mix is the hardest of them all. Although this never intended to be a commercial record, I recommend this to any trance fan."
5,I love this!!!,"I have only had this a couple of month, but it is the most wonderful machine. It mixes cream cheese for cheese cake in a matter of seconds.I can't stop using it. I only wish it came with more recipes. I am hooked! I had to order the mixer and blender."
2,Had for a year now - replacing!,"Great quality product, but has a major design flaw also mentioned by previous reviewers. It is bothering me so much that I am going to get another make of processor.When the blade and bowl are assembled, the inside lip (under the blade cover) is not high enough. Therefore everything you process (even small amounts) is squeezed up and under the lip and under the blade threads by the centrifugal force.This needs intensive cleaning as I have discovered - I use mine for many things but mainly meat for meatballs - and cleaning out the raw meat to prevent future contamination is a nightmare. I have to use a toothpick. If you leave it it will rot and be a safety concern, as it will mix in whatever you process next. As I don't wish to spend such time cleaning due to a design flaw, or worse, causing food poisoning to friends and family - I am going to order a new processor. This should be top spec - love how it runs, but is a liability."
1,I would never buy this brand again!,"It processes well, but I would NEVER buy this type again. The base bowl does not unattach easily (it's a pain!), and the is a whole in the middle where the blade is and you have to pray that you can hold it down from the bottom if you want to dump anything out without spilling it. Such a pain in the butt. My $10 garage sale processor is more practical!"
2,Not for anything liquid,"I bought this unit because of all of the positive reviews, however I find myself returning it. When making something like salsa, cole slaw or other dishes that contain even the smallest amount liquid, the liquid will come through the middle of the device under the blade and out the bottom of the bowl. Unfortunately it is a pain to clean up! Additionally the unit is very bulky and doesn't fit into my cupboard or on my counter. I love KitchenAid (I've had a mixer for years and wouldn't give it up), but this downside of not being able to handle any liquid makes the device completely irrelevant for me.To clarify: the ridge from the bottom of the bowl at the hole in the center (over which the blade fits) was only about 1/4 - 1/2 inch tall. Not like other processors that i have seen that are about 2 inches tall, thereby allowing for some liquid in the bowl without spilling up and under the blade."
2,A fatal design flaw,"I bought my processor last November because I was going to be making the family Thanksgiving dinner. For slicing and most dicing, it works well. The most important problem with it is that the center lip of the work bowl is only about 1 inch high, which means that's the most liquid it will hold. That's approximately the amount of juice produced by 6 lemons, which really is not very much at all, so it really limits its usefulness. Another problem is the small work bowl slants out, so the blade throws whatever you're dicing up where some of it stays while whatever's on the bottom gets pulverized. If I had read more reviews before I bought it, I would not have. I really relied on the Kitchenaid name, which in this case did not pay off."
4,Gift for a Chef,"KitchenAid KFP740CR 9-Cup Food Processor with 4-Cup Mini Bowl, ChromeI bought this for my son who is the sous-chef for an upscale local restaurant.He is very pleased by the versatility and ease of use of this machine. He has favorably compared it to the professional unit in use at the restaurant and in some ways thinks that this is even better and more consistent that the unit at his work.Good or bad I cannot personally say---but the chef in the family is quite pleased which speaks highlyy for this unit!"
4,"So far, so good","Seems very substantial. I have had it 2 months and have made cookie dough, pizza dough, thanksgiving stuffing, and soup, among other things. It did leak a bit with the soup, but then again, the soup recipe makes 12 cups, so why wouldn't a 9 cup processor leak with 12 cups of fluid in it? It feels very weighty and I don't have safety concerns about the ""flimsiness"" of the lid that others have described. My reason for giving 4 instead of 5 stars is just that, for this price, I think ANY food processor should come with some kind of blade storage device. Once this FP is unpacked, the blades are just loose in a bag, and yes, I cut myself in the first 5 days I had it. I am now looking for that storage device...but wishing it was included and spared me a sliced finger!"
4,Still winning ...,"Robbie Williams capitolizes on his tongue-in-cheek image of commercial bubble gum music by putting out a collection of varied songs which showcase a maturer side of pop-lyric writing. The British celeb is able to distinguish himself from boy bands which stand by their choreography and sappy love songs with catchy hooks and memorable samples from songs like, Gloria Gaynor's ""I Will Survive."" Stand-out songs like ""Better Man"", ""Kids"" and ""Love Calling Earth"" give fans a look into the popstar's view of himself. ""Better Man"" stands as a confessional, a prayer if you will, and is ironically contrasted with the bass-ridden ""Rock DJ"", laced with all the demons Robbie seems to want to purge from the former title. Given that pop music doesn't stand as a cornerstone of much at all except in record sales, it makes sense to not take this album so seriously. Rather, join Robbie on the ride, throw it on the CD player and listen to this one artist while he's still winning."
4,Alittle Beatlish.,Every song on this album has a great hook and melody. Very beatlish and left me with the impression that if Oasis made a pop album this is how it would sound. This is his best album by far but I do recommend THE EGO HAS LANDED for the simple fact that it's a greatest hits package of his first two solo albums which were only released in the U.K.
5,Pretty good,"Robbie William's latest release is pretty typical of Williams' music. The music on here is not as famous as his other releases, but if you enjoy Williams' other albums, you'll probably like this one."
4,Another Winner!!,"Robbie Williams has done it again. This CD is an eclectic mix of infectious tunes, much like his brilliant ""The Ego Has Landed"". I seriously doubted he could have two amazing albums back to back,(rare for ANY artist)but he has proven me wrong. My favorite song is the one that took the longest time to grow on me - ""Let Love Be Your Energy"". ""Supreme"", ""Kids"" and ""Better Man"" are also great. ""Rock DJ"" is so much fun - it's pure disco. But has anyone else noticed that it too (like Supreme) is a sample tune? You can hear Barry White's ""Ecstasy"" throughout the chorus (many of you are probably too young to have heard that song). And it is also very close in style to ""Pop Musik"" by M.All in all, I think ""The Ego Has Landed"" is a better all around CD. But ""Sing When You're Winning"" is a VERY worthy follow-up and will not disappoint. I only wish more people in the US would discover him - he's a rare talent."
4,I Don't Wanna Stop!,"I was in studying in Oxford this past July and heard the first single from Sing When You're Winning, Rock DJ. It was one of those songs that you hear just once, then proceed to sing to everyone you know, praying that they know the name of it, who its by and where you can find It. Fortunalty one of my friends had the same obsession and searched high and low for the CD. The single came out the last day were were in England and we bought it. I now have the full CD and love it. The music is dancey and cheeky just like the controversy that is Robbie Williams. And try to check out the video for Rock DJ .. it was banned from the BBC during the day, because of its graphic content. . . .he pulls his skin off . . ."
4,"No ""Ego"" but after a few listens...worth the purchase",I was immediatly captivated by the Ego cd and could not give it enough praise. This cd does not live up to my own personal hype and expectations. I listened to it a few times more and I started to really enjoy it. The music falls into the same pop territory already covered but RW does it with such flair. He has a great sense of humor and really writes a great hook. He gives boy band's everywhere a good name.
3,Okay but not that great,"This book is a quick read and a good introduction for someone who is interested in pursuing a religious/spiritual work, although it isn't exactly the book I was looking for. I thought it was rather boring and when I'm not interested in a book, it seems impossible to read. I think this is an okay book, but its not going to make you jump up and down with excitement."
3,Quit Crying,"After reading all the negative reviews, I was expecting a real dud when I finally got around to ""End of Ages,"" and considered not even bothering with it. I was actually pleasantly surprised, thank you. Granted the game is short and generally not up to the standards of the previous MYST tiles, but I enjoyed every minute, and a great deal more than most of the more recent PC puzzle games I've played. The story was compelling, the graphics stunning, and the puzzles well integrated into the plot and mostly mind boggling- par for the course from Cyan. After I finished it, I felt a pang of relief and sadness that I had completed the quest, grateful that they have all been created and made available by Cyan Worlds, but could not fault Cyan one bit for promptly closing up shop immediately after publishing their swan song."
2,Major let down,"Basically I agree with the previous detractors. This installment was a complete and utter let down. I was expecting a grand finale, but it was a soggy firework instead. Way to easy, not really puzzle based at all (or at least too few and too simple), and visually disappointing also. Stick with the first 4 games and give this a miss unless you are a real fan and really care what happens in the end."
1,Want to practice your drawing?,"I can't believe after buying the Limited Edition which came with the Prima strategy guide I still can't get the slate drawings to work. You have to have them absolutely perfect or you'll spend hours redrawing them. This is the most frustrating game I've ever played. I finished all the other Myst games in a few days. And enjoyed them mostly. I've spent 3 days and numerous game guide sites trying to figure out how to draw a symbol in Todelmer good enough to move along. If it wasn't for the startegy guide I would have assumed I was on the wrong path. I was able to get the first few slate drawings to work only after multiple tries. Never did see the difference from one that worked and ones that didn't. Any one want to buy this before I throw it the trash? I wouldn't even take your money. It's that bad. Also emailed Help at Ubi and they were absolutely no help. But of course, what did I expect."
5,"Fascinating History, Mesmerizing Characters","Cherie Claire's latest book, Emilie, is the first in a series, The Acadians, that traces a family's struggle to survive separation and exile from the land they love. The story of Emilie and Lorenz is a vibrant tale of friendship catching fire against the realistic setting of the 18th century Louisiana Territory. Ms. Claire's characters are imperfect, but so compelling that you'll cheer for them to come together. Don't miss this unusual setting and this unforgettable family."
1,Nothing original about this CD!,"Unfortunately, the only thing original about this release is in the title. Sure, most of the selections are done by the original artists, but nothing is even close to the real thing in terms of what made the song a hit in the first place. I guess this'll be another brightly colored coaster for my collection."
3,The product is great,My dogs love their treats that I make them when I use this rolling pin as they get more treat per bite. I was rolling them way too thin prior to this. I would have given it a higher rating except one of the rollers arrived broken. Luckily it was a size I probably won't ever use because it was the largest one and my dogs don't need treats that big . .
5,Great deal and in perfect new condition,All items were in tip-top condition and well packaged. Thanks what a fantastic deal!I would definitely purchase this item again!
3,"Health benefits good, but would not buy again","It is a very healthful tea, but the flavor is too woody for me. If they had added more orange peel, that would have been better. It just is quite odd tasting. Woody almost like artichoke, maybe. Hard to describe. Not terrible, but just a bit weird."
4,Exquisite Cult Crime Novel,"This is an e-book reprint of one of Charyn's earlier releases. With a gritty style that defines the genre, the author delves into the lives of Manfred Coen and Isaac Sidel with persistence and precision.Before the reader unfolds a literary crime novel that captivates and digs deep into the lives of its characters. Charyn spends a great deal of time developing Coen, Sidel, Arnold the Spic, the Chinaman and others. The story evolves slowly, and once the reader is done, she knows every part of it.The material is a bit dated, which accounts for its lack of political correctness, but it's genuine for the world in which Coen and Sidel exist.Blue Eyes isn't a normal read for me, but I enjoyed it."
3,A Decent Introduction to Cataloging,"The book provides a good introduction to the confusing (for many) world of cataloging. However, because of its size, it does not go into necessary depth for individuals in a LTA position.If you are completely unfamiliar with the language of cataloging and classification, start with this book, then get Wynar's Introduction to Cataloging and Classification or Lois Mai Chan's Cataloging and Classification: An Introduction. If you're feeling adventurous, just skip to Wynar or Chan."
2,Kindle Version full of Errors,"I'm a big fan of Edward Lee (I even interviewed him for Bizarro Central) and this book is an interesting change of pace. It's a SF story with UFOs, government conspiracies, and lots of suspense. But the Kindle version is full of typos and formatting errors like sentences dropping to the next line for no reason. It's frustrating because I've formatted kindle books and always go back to read through to make sure these very simple cosmetic problems aren't there.And for the price, I'm disappointed to get such a presentation of one of my favorite authors.So long story short: the story is good but the format is lacking. I'm not sure if any of the typos are in the paperback (I doubt it) but get that instead if seeing an error/typo on every other page will annoy you."
2,Mapmaker's wife - NOT!,"As the 1-star reviews point out, this book is NOT about the mapmaker's wife. It certainly isn't about the title character who was the mapmaker's assistant's wife. The wife hardly plays any role in this book. While the book is filled with all sorts of interesting characters and events, it's too much a hodge-podge of information. The story deserves a much better author's hand."
3,Mapmaker's Wife,"International Books said they sent me the book on February 5th, as this was a book for a book club meeting on March 1st, I felt I would receive the book in about a week and would have plenty of time to read it. The book arrived Feb. 27th. While I have tried to contact International Book, to ask them why they thought the book would take 22 days to arrive, I have been unsuccessful in doing that. I won't use their site again."
4,"Wife's tale is interesting, but the science is what kept me reading","While the book is woefully mistitled, it's a good read providing a very detailed history of the quest for measuring the shape of the earth and longitude and latitude and the problems that arose. Clearly, this was a difficult and amazing accomplishment. The plot, as it were, is about this 13 year old spanish woman in peru who marries one of the explorers who comes to South America from France on an expedition to determine whether Newton was right that the earth was a sphere. But the main focus (most of the book) is on the actual process of measuring and the difficulties offered in South America (swamps, rivers, tension among the Portuguese, Spanish, french and English, bugs, weather, etc). The characters themselves aren't well developed but the wife does come across as a courageous woman when she attempts to come to her husband and traverse the amazon woefully unprepared."
2,"Could be better, but works.","This product fits on the gearbox fine, but one important note - Some older gearboxes use a 13/16 shaft, and this is a 3/4 coupler for the newer gear boxes. It will not fit the 13/16 shafts.Also, it is not an exact clone of the GM part. This part was essentially copied upside down, with the flat ""key"" on the wrong side of the casting. It will work fine, but your steering wheel will be upside-down unless you also take apart your column and flip the ball joint 180 degrees. If you don't have tilt steering, you'll have to modify this part or just live with the upside down wheel.Also, the bolts it comes with are short, so it's difficult to bolt to the lower steering shaft. They should be about 1/4"" longer, or you can easily replace them with new ones from the hardware store.If you can find another manufacturer or the original GM part, it may be worth it - I'm still looking."
5,A Sailors Book,"As a former US Navy Sailor, I feel this is one of the greatest books on what it is to be a Sailor at sea and the bonds that are created. I cried through much of this book as the empathy flowed through my soul. I loaned my copy to a buddy and it ended going viral. So many years later, I wanted to read it again, so I am here to order another copy. Buy it read it....if not for the stories within the book, then the accuracy of the History therein."
2,Not what I expected,"Not what I expected from the reviews and all the ads. I was hoping for the traditional FF type game, but got a very simple level by level game. I'm not saying its bad but I did not get anything out of it and have already sold it back for store credit. I would rent first then buy based on what you think."
2,Didn't do it for me...,"This game seems like it's a bit of a marketing ploy. Sure, if you and 3 friends have a GBA with adapters, then I guess it's no big thing. But if everyone invests in a GBA, they might be disappointed by the multiplayer aspects. The game itself isn't all that fun as the plot is rather thin and the gameplay is annoying. I will say that the sound and graphics are all decent, which is to be expected from Square."
1,Don't even bother renting this game.,"This game SUCKS. See, I thought that when Nintendo released FFCC...that it would be GOOD. WELL GUESS WHAT!!?!?!? IT WASNT! Yet again, nintendo killed another great series. In this game you collect myrrh (or however its spelled) to restore the tree and protect you yadda yadda yada. Sounds good......NO! You have to pretty much replay the game OVER AND OVER AGAIN. I replayed it 5 times since once u restore the trees power you have to go out and do it again (I got up to year 5) and i said to myself....you know what?!!? **** this game. IT SUCKS!! A LOT! DON'T buy this game, DON'T rent it, if you see it in a store window TURN AWAY AS AFAST AS YOU CAN AND RUN THE OTHER WAY!!!! Nintendo is going downhill. SNES was great it had awsome games...after N64 came out... in my opinion...Nintendo will go the way of the Dreamcast..."
4,One of the main reasons to own a Gamcube(and maybe a GBA),"to put it simple, this game is among one of the better games on GCN IMO. Being an avid gamer, I espicially love the FF series. never hated a single one...except legends...that sucked... anyway, Gameplay is pretty much Hack and slash, which is good, cuz it doesn't really make learning controls a helluvalot easier than most RPGs. Story, although linear, is pretty average. Sounds in the game are near perfect, although there is no Voiceovers, except in the themesong and the narrator girl. Visuals, my god, they look beautiful. water effects are nice, and the spell animations are pretty good. also, the surroundings are pretty detailed, just not to an extent of ""OMG THIZ IS TEH GRATEEST GRAFIX EVAR!!!"". That's the gist of it, seeing as I'm limited to how many words i can type. oh, and to all those who gave the game bad ratings, PLAY THE ... GAME BEFORE YOU RATE IT..."
4,Well researched history of Arkansas in the Civil War,Well researched and presented essays on Arkansas in the Civil War. While the volume is rather short and the discussions of the military operations lacking in some detail there is still much completeness in the work especially regarding the civilian aspect of the war.
1,Not very good. What a waste,"Try the Margaret Roach book which is excellent or even a Jerry Baker book. Martha probably enever did any real gardening in Nutley, NJ."
5,Cyclist Eyeglass Mirror Rectangle,These work great on my everyday eyeglasses. They were easy to put on & off for every bike ride. They are easy to adjust. Thank you Debbie D in CT.
1,"Unuseable, useless (zero stars, but they won't let you click zero stars)","No matter how I attached this to my glasses, I could see nothing worth seeing. The mirror sits very close to the head. When I adjusted it so it was aimed behind me, all I could see was my ear. When I moved the mirror far enough to the left to see around my ear, it was so far to the left that I could not move my eye far enough left to see it. If I turned my head to see it, of course the mirror moved too, so I couldn't see what I wanted to.I let the deadline to return it pass so I guess I'm stuck with it. I'll sell it cheap or give it away."
2,Diasppointed,"Although this item was a gift, I was very disappointed in the quality. It is very flimpsy and cheap looking. I read all the reviews and most raved about it except for one person whom I agee with. However, the recipient of this item was ok with it."
1,Compact model impractical!!,"When I bought the compact model, I assumed the mirror alone was smaller as to create less of a dsitraction. However, I now realize that the entire body is smaller, and more importantly SHORTER!! So, unless you have an eyeball where everyone else has their temple, you too will not be able make the compact version viable. Am returning for original size."
4,Bike peddler eyeglass cycling mirror,Only used once so far. Fits on glasses very nicely. Looks to be durable and works well. Very nice product.
5,Best mirror I have used.,"I have used other mirrors made of plastic and have broken all of them. The Take-A-Look mirror is made of strong metal tubing and wire. It is simple but very good design. I think it would be very difficult to break. Once adjusted, it offers the best view of the road behind of any mirror that I have seen on the market. There is an adjustment period as you get used to using it. But once you do, you will wonder how you lived without it. I am so confident with the view behind that it gives me that I rarely look back when I need to maneuver over to the left. Not everyone likes a mirror that attaches to your glasses, but if you really want to now what is behind you, it is is the best choice."
4,somewhat problematic,"I bought this so I could see behind me without turning my head, but it is not working for me yet. I wear prescription eyeglasses with very thin temples and the mirror does not seem to like fitting on them. I do not wear a helmet, rather a glowwear ranger hat, and I have not yet found a workaround to make this mirror work. One thought is a headband light worn just above the bridge of the nose might work, and give extra light plus a rear view. With wider temples on the glasses, there might be no problem at all."
5,Ride more safely w/bike mirror,"I love my bicycle rear view mirror so much I got 5 more for friends who ride. It attaches to your sunglasses & within about 5 minutes of riding you will be in love with it. You can see who is right behind you as well as the cars coming up in the lanes next to you. I can't believe I ever rode without it. I prefer the longer version since I'm old & don't have perfect close up vision any more. I would also recommend Bike Peddler, as the Amazon store for Take A Look Cycling Eyeglass Mirror purchase. I ordered 3 mirrors each time. They came in just days & were $4.50 cheaper, each, than in a store, if you can even find them in a local store."
5,Best Cycling Mirror,Love this mirror. Offers a clear wide view of oncoming traffic. It is very well made and easy to adjust. No vibration like other mirrors (helmet or handlebar).
5,Best in class,"There is a good reason that this item is highly rated by most.I am an avid cyclist and have used at least a half a dozen different mirrors in my search for a view of the road behind me.This is the ONLY one that I would recommend. I wish that I had found this before purchasing a multitude of inferior plastic models.The materials are all of a high quality.I'm not a fan of handlebar mounted mirrors because they all seem to be too adversely effected by vibration from the bike/road, making it difficult to get a clear image of what's behind you.This design is ideal for me as I always wear glasses when I ride. A little bit of adjustment when I start out is all that's necessary unless I bump it while wiping sweat from my forehead.The one tip that I would give is to move it as far forward on the arm of your glasses as possible. The farther away from your eyeball the better.It causes less strain on the eye while looking in the mirror and makes adjustment easier for the perfect view."
4,Not for everyone,You need time to adapt to these. It mounts well but it so close to the eye that requires you to see things differently. I purchased this for my commute but after I found the STI mountable mirror I installed that in my road bike and now I wear these when I go out with my hybrid. They work well but I still get a bit confused sometimes because my periferal visions keeps capturing everything when my head is moving. When I am looking straight ahead I am completely comfortable with them
5,Cycling Eyeglass Mirror,"I was extremely pleased with the quality of this product. Stainless steel, brass, the mirror is the only thing that is plastic (so they say) but it looks like glass and is crystal clear. This is by far the highest quality product that I found. Well worth the investment, and I have not been able to say that too often lately.I got mine from Bike Peddler on Amazon"
4,Really descent mirror,"This mirror is quite small but large enough to safely see a large area behind you. The light weight is not noticable at all. It fastens very easily. All in all, it's a great gadget and does the job."
5,Excellent assistant,"I already own one and purchased this for a friend. I do not ride without this as it gives me eyes in the back of my head. I owned another mirror before but this one is by far the best, as it gives a clear view of everything behind you and is easy to place on your glasses and easy to look up and see what is behind you. Would definitely recommend this to anyone who wants to be safer on the roads or to see what is happening behind you in a pack"
2,Cumbersome mirror,Seriously don't waste your money. Difficult to install and mirror scratches way too easily. Ok if you ride once a month and have a nice clear shelf to store your helmet.
2,watch out for small print edition,"I ordered a version of this dictionary based on Elizabeth Yu's comment that it was readable for one with failing eyesight. The book I got was NOT readable for me (it must have been 6 pt type or less--I have normal vision problems for a person in their 40s, I have no trouble reading a newspaper).I think there is a large and small print version of this book with identical titles--note ISBN: 0195911512 has dimensions of about 5"" x 7"", but ISBN: 7100039339 does not give dimensions and the photo looks narrower (mine is about 2.5"" x 5"").So if you want readable print, check the size of the book."
2,The Eyes of Horus are Upon You,"Carol Thurston has managed to jumble together enough actual facts and interesting details to give Eye of Horus a boost over the typical thriller, but the lumpy writing and long totally unnecessary passages really drag it down. The story flip flops between Kate McKinnon, modern day artist, and the ancient unknown princess of Egypt, Aset. The mystery is based on a real one, namely how did a particular mummy get an extra head wrapped up in it, and whose mummy was it. This is the problem Kate is trying to solve, and the outcome Aset is unwittingly trying to avoid. Inbetween is alot of truly valueable daily life stuff for ancient Egypt and alot of useless modern day formula as well. The sad truth of the matter is, The Eye of Horus could have been a much better book were it about one hundred pages shorter. As it stands, its an entertaining read for an audience that's used to skipping pages at the slow parts."
2,too much work for such little payback,"This book is written with alternating sections set in ancient Egypt and the present. It's very hard to keep track of the Egyptian characters because you don't constantly read about them and they call each other by nicknames. (Too much work.) Also, it's pretty hard to care about the female character in the past when it's obvious by her mummy in the present that she dies a gruesome death--you know this by page 75 or so! So immediately you distance yourself from her because you know she's going to be killed. (Too much work.) It also bothered me that the author decided Nefertiti was a horrible person. I eventually gave up and just read the ""present"" chapters about the medical illustrator and the doctor... and was still frustrated, because they missed a lot of obvious things. The only interesting part was the actual archaeological practices. If you like Lynda S. Robinson and Laura Haney, stick with them and give this a miss."
3,Useful gift but don't forget to buy paper.,"Watercolor Masterclass: A Complete Guide to Watercolor With Twelve Inspiring Projects by Bill Diggins, Carrie Hill, and Ian Sidaway (Watson-Guptill) is a useful book-kit that provides a beginner's introduction to the most fashionable of painting techniques. Makes an especially good gift because provides brush and paints for the trial projects. However one should also get some watercolor paper."
1,"Great Product, Horrible Price","A great product, does a great job at cleaning grills. But a $2.99 item being sold for over $12.00 is outrageous!! Suggest the Charcoal Companion Scrubber Refills, 4 pack for less than $7.00."
1,Not made for people with stiff fingers,The design of the clasp makes it almost impossible to open clasp once it is closed -- especially when one has stiff fingers. The clasp is located inside the watch band so that it is hidden from view when worn. If the watch band is tight or you have stiff fingers it is very difficult to release the clasp.
4,A wonderful and evocative book,"A great book about tragic events in a beautiful country. The author shadows the travels and travails of Victorian adventurer/administrator, George Scott. The result is a narrative that is readable and engrossing. Marshall presents a wealth of historical material in a relatively short volume (quite unlike the typical contemporary non-fiction book). He is at his weakest when he romanticizes Scott's relationship with the locals in Burma and skirts the excesses of colonial rule. He also neglects Scott's more patronizing and condescending writings about the people of Burma. On the other hand, Marshall presents a very readable account of comtemporary history in the country and a credible portarait of the current regime.I have visited Burma in the past few years and Marshall's descriptions of people and places were quite evocative of what I saw. Hopefully, the same will be true for other readers, regardless of whether they have traveled there or not."
3,Chilton GM Camaro,Basic information. Not near as good as the Factory Manual. Good for general maintenance work. If you are going to do a complete rebuild or restoration I would recommend the Factory manual.
3,Could have more detail,"As a sometimes mechanic, this book has been average for me. A few times I have pinpointed a problem with my Camaro, and according to the book, it's a walk in the park. Once you get down to it, reality sets in, and you realise the incompleteness of the info. I personally would prefer a lot more photos, and more realistic descriptions."
5,lyrical feast !!,"Every one new that cuban link was gonna provide for us after the death of his best friend pun so this was always gonna be a dope cut but we ended up getting double that and more the lyrics not only are strong through out but the beat is tight. This single is for people who are fans of pun,cuban link and just about any one with a taste for hip hop even if you dont like hip hop too much this is a cut that will touch you and have you reachin for the re-wind button you can't help but feel this tune!!Have a look for cuban links album 24K 'cause thats gonna be dope for sureR.I.P CHRISTOPHER RIOS A.K.A BIG PUN"
4,Good song,I like how rappers dedicate songs to their deceased loved ones because it shows that they have a heart and they're not really the bad people that others make them out to be. I didn't really like Big Pun that much but I understand what a great loss he was to his friends and family. Check this out!
3,Peter Frampton - Now,"An interesting album by Peter, but far from anything he's ever done. I have to admit that I like the old stuff better, but it is by no means bad. I rate it 3 out of 5 stars."
5,A Pleasant Surprise,"This DVD was wonderful and hypnotic to watch. I was surprised how good it was. But there was another surprise. the DVD comes with 'prism' glasses that can be used to view other psychedelic videos you may have. Such as:'Happy 2b Hardcore' by Moonshine/AVX.'Transambient 1,2, and 3', also by Moonshine/AVX'Spaced Out' also by Moonshine/AVXThe other 3 DVD's are also sold by Amazon so check them out.It was fun to put these other DVD's on and watch them wearing the 'prism' glasses from Sydney's Psych Adventure and my own electronic music from my cd collection thumping away.Anyway, Get this DVD you wont be dissapointed."
5,Fun for all! Not just for smokers.,I love this DVD. The music is upbeat and fun. The kaleidoscope type pictures flashing in and out are amazing. This is for kids and adults not just for the smoking hippies. It only came with one pair of glasses so we had to pass them around however it comes with a form to order more and it looks great without them too.
1,Broke quickly,Handle broke twisting it into sand after about the 3rd day of use. On first use the plastic changed color indicating high stress where the umbrella pole is tightened. Returned for refund and bought a metal one from elsewhere.
1,Did not work,I had an old metal one that screwed beautifully into the sand. This one did not screw into the sand at all.
3,Not worth the price,"These pj's are very cute but not very good quality for the price. I loved them when I first put them on, they are very comfortable, but the top stretches out after nursing and looks very sloppy. I wish I would have had these when I was pregnant. They would be great for maternity pj's as long as you don't have to pull down the breast part for nursing."
3,Whats turning?,plane can't keap in air much also turns horably my best flight it turned in a circle back to me
1,SUCKS,"This was the worst toy i ever got!!!!!!it broke on the first try, did a nose dive into the groundsYes i did charge it 2 times but it sucks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!never get this toy ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Buy AERO ACE INSTEAD - this is junk,"The Defender simply sucks. While it may be true that ""after lots of practice"" and ""with some patience"" you can learn to fly this plane, my question is WHY BOTHER? Just spend the extra $10 and buy the Aero Ace instead!The real problem with the Defender is the cheap controller. It only has one stick for controlling throttle and turning. The Aero Ace has two sticks, thus making it controllable."
1,"Trash, rubbish and a piece of junk","I bought this for my son as it seemed like a reasonable buy at Toys R Us. But every penny spent on this was wasted.The first problem you will encounter is recharging the plane itself. We were able to charge it one time, and after that no more. To charge it, you have to hold the plane firmly against a charging point on the remote while holding a button on the remote depressed.When we attempted to fly it the first time, the wing broke. While the box states that the plane is made of ""High-density ESP Foam,"" it is very flimsy, and just putting it back in the box caused another part of the plane to crack.Don't make our mistake. Save your money."
5,Solid Advice with An Interesting Twist,"Managing a nation in the 16th century took stamina and skill for a leader of either sex during such a volatile period of exploration and conquest -- the time period also offers an excellent opportunity in which to examine successes and failures. Alan Axelrod's Elizabeth I, CEO is an interesting analysis of the strong management skills that Queen Bess brought to the task and developed in the process of ruling Britannia -- and he is adept at showing how we can apply such strengths to our own management approaches and develop new strengths, as well. Nice, too, that we can see what worked and what didn't work for Elizabeth I."
4,not too shabby,A new naval officer but with some years of merchant experience to call on. NOt a beginner and no beginner errors of seamanship to fret over. We fret with him over the bad crew members and the long distance ashore romance to keep going with an enemy in the house. Her father.
3,"His worst, which could be almost any other author's best","Rushdie's other novels have always been long, flowing novel-poems which swept me away with their richness and speed. Fury, while good, read more like every other modern novel. By choosing to keep it as a mystery rather than going on a long journey throughout the entire lives of the characters, he lost the mythic feel that always attracted me to his writing. It moved both more slowly and more lightly than his previous works - it lost that quick marvelous seriousness that he's always had in such abundance.It was a good book, sure, a great book even. I enjoyed reading it, and it swept me away into the story. I'm glad to own it and loan it and reread it eventually, I'm sure. But when it comes down to it, Fury is a book written by a man; his other stories were written by a god."
3,"Do you like watching a great actor star in a ""B"" movie?","Fury doesn't stack up to Rushdie's other novels. It's good and all, but like a ""B"" movie with a great actor in it, Fury disappoints.Rushdie's climactic image of the three women in Malik Solanka's life standing over his bed and stirring up a firestorm of accusation and betrayal is sort of intriguing. But it's also highly contrived, kind of like the sci-fi novella within the story, and the escape to terror island ending.Fans of mythology, the muse, the three furies, etc. will enjoy his modern take on the Gods. If you're one of those, have at it. Also, if you are into web-based interactive games, this book will be fun for you. It kind of reminds me of the movie, Existenz. Or, if you are short on reasons for not liking America, Fury could help you out with that too.The book is kind of depressing. Most people would be better off reading one of his other works, which rock, and which truly deserve the attention it takes to read Rushdie."
1,Babe Ruth Strikes Out.,"After the bristling pace and hair-raising experiences of reading Midnight's Children, The Satantic Verses, and Shame, I had high hopes for Fury. Alas, this book staggers, slumps, drags--it stinks. There are flashes of Salman the BIG FISH here, brilliant flashes, but ultimately the book is a flop. Even the Babe struck out now and then."
2,Before this edition,I read this book in 2002 before the united states printing to draw a personal conclusion on the subject of the writing of salman rushdie. I found it to be on par with the writing of anais nin. I don't think it's the author's fault for printing it. This book is a waste of time on par with a trip to an adult bookstore. I suppose anyone who is a registered sex offender would like this book.
1,pop culture at its worst,"There is bubble gum music and then there is Fury. I loved Midnights Children and expect the same kind of magic with words but I should confidently say, do not waste your time and money on this one."
2,Buy something else,"I've never read any other Rushdie and decided to pick this short one up as a way in (it's only 250 pages). It reads pretty quickly and it's funny at times, but it doesn't really work. The plot's contrived, the characters thin and the ending is just weird."
1,Disappointing,"This was my first read of Rushdie. I read gushing reviews of this book and thought I'd give him a try. I only got 60 pages in and had to put it down. I thought he was trying to prove how smart and clever he is, and I am convinced. But that doesn't make for an enjoyable read. Maybe the critics get wet reading this type book full of ego-driven intellectual gymnastics, but I'll pass. There has to be some heart, something I can relate to my life, and a break from the sarcasm and chest puffing. I read for enjoyment, not self abuse."
5,A Book About Nothing and Everything,"This novel was more a mesh-mash than anything else. Though it's focused on the life and times of Malik Solanka the main character and reading this novel I identified closely with Malik who leaves his wife and child for New York City to well...lose himself and deal with his ""fury"". A form of anger that only the person feeling it can understand. It's like your own personal anger and it's understandable that only you can understand it as it pertains to your personal experiences. Well, Malik seems to play a passive observer to the general absurdity of human society which in part infuriates him at the same time this anger keeps him on the sideline. The other characters don't seem to be fully developed the seem more like personas than actual people but now I am just being picky. This novel carried on more like a Woody Allen film but infinitely more interesting."
3,Good but still lacking in some respects,"Better than Virtual Pose 2, but still lacking in some respects. There are 71 poses, 47 of which are of young caucasian females, mostly tastefull and mostly in natural poses, some strategically airbrushed as other have noted. Good definition, mostly under diffuse lighting without hard shadows. Facial expressions are generally rather serious. Very easy to view, rotate and print pictures. However, I'd recommend replacing the cheap vinyl (not archival grade) disc holders glued to the inside back cover. The vinyl solvents had already turned the adhesive to brown sticky goo by the time that I bought my book.) To export still photos into photo editing software, you'll also need Quicktime Pro...another $29 if you don't already have the ""Pro"" version. For easy export and photo quality, I still preferArt Models 3: Life Nude Photos for the Visual Arts (Art Models series) (No. 3)"
4,"I love this book, Good reference and concept : )","I just got this book yesterday. It has 70 poses; 47 for women,23 for men. Using 4 women ; they are normal to skinny in shape. Using 2 men: one old is around age 70 and one is around age 25. I'm not a great sculptor but I would give some comments from my opinion, if it might help you guys to decide about this book.1. It's really useful and helpful refrences. I can rotate around and see all detail and form, awsome!. I can zoom in but not that much cuz somehow the image is little blur though.2. As above, there are 4 women but pretty skinny. For me, it's good to have all kind of woman in pose especially a little muscular women then it's easy to figure out the muscle form underneath the skin. And also the male model, this book has only old and normal male images. It would be better if they put the muscular guy also for same reason.3. Images are high resolution but the lighting in many images is not strong enough to get and understand the form."
4,great deal,"First, I am very happy with this book. 2500 poses (on cd) can keep an aspiring artist busy for a while. On the other hand, the lighting is a bit harsh at times.If you are a Mac user, this is the one for you as it works with OSX.As for the censoring...yes there is some, and sometimes it seems randomly selected. It really isn't distracting for me as I am not drawing at such a detailed level. I would hardly have noticed anything if I hadn't read the reviews mentioning censoring. Regarding the censoring of women and not men...this is NOT true! The men are censored, you just have to look closer (not that I was really looking that close..). Unless you are really interested in drawing people's private areas in detail (nothing wrong with that of course) you won't be bothered."
4,Not bad,I received my product in a timely fashion. It's not the crispest lens at distance but it's a pretty good macro lens.
1,"Purchased two, both have defective coatings","I purchased two of these at a Ritz Camera store while on vacation since the Ritz near my home had closed recently. The first filter has a small grain of something caught under the coating. Multiple cleanings didn't help. I used the second filter for a month when I noticed the coating delaminating in one area. Since I didn't have a local Ritz, I contacted them online. Their response was to take it to the nearest Ritz for replacement. I couldn't get them to understand that it wasn't worth it to me to try to return it to the ""nearest"" Ritz. I've since purchased two Hoya filters from Adorama and am very pleased with the quality. [...]"
2,Lensbaby not for Nikon D40,"I was so excited to get this product. I thought i would improve my photographic skills, but it hardly works with Nikon D40. They should mention that it only works with high end professional cameras like D300, D200, D2xs etc. Quality is fine but the result i get from broad daylight are very poor. I will not recommend this product for Aspiring Pro Photogs"
5,Mexican history in the form of the caudillo's biographies,"It is amazing how the author makes history very interesting to read. I personally love the way this book is organized. The reader is able to know what was happening in Mexico during specific times while reading the biographies of the most popular Mexican heroes. As a result, the reader is able to Understand the character by analyzing their ideologies and motives as well as seeing their qualities and their flaws. I would describe this book as a time machine because it makes the audience feel what is being said. I am totally happy with this purchase, the book is worth what it costs."
3,Amelia Peabody is like a mature Indiana Jones.,"This book is about what you fantasize about at work. It's too incredulous to be true but that is the charm of it. You wish it were true and that you were in Amelia Peabody's place. Instead of being one of those confounded tourists. In The Last Camel Died at Noon, Amelia and Emerson (along with the irrepressable Ramses) set out to do something but I forget what since it has been so long since I've read it. Anyway, just read it simce that was what you were going to do in the first place. What's the point of knowing all about it before you read it?"
3,Aimed at scratch builders & experts only,"No, not for the novice, but a collection of tips of the trade for experts. New to the hobby, DO NOT BOTHER!This spiral bound collection of vague descriptions, terrible photos and worse presentation (I think it has been photcopied not printed)has been compiled by some of the greatest modellers of all time. They are not publishers!It covers all aspects of the hobby, from making your own cabinet to build ships in, to electroplating. The section on planking is woeful. If you are good enough to need this book, you don't."
2,Low quality Faux Sweatpant,"Ordered these because I prefer a sweatpant without a pocket, however that is the only good thing about them. They are thin and lightweight with a very cheap feel to them. The drawstring is very weak and breakable, unusable actually. They are very undersized also, a large is more like a medium or medium small. These are comparable to the cheapo sweatpants you see in big box stores that sell for $5. Unfortunately I paid much more than that."
5,comfortable,"These are thick and definitely last. Well worth the money! The size runs big and long in my opinion, but I am too tall for petite and to short for regular. Basically they cover my back side unlike most styles today and go all the way to my ankles. I wear them quite often around the house and they are still going strong."
2,oersized,"good weight to the pant but the sizeing is bad , too long and very big in the leg and backside department"
1,This shoe reminds me of a second hand knock-off. It's craftsmanship is nothing like it used too be.,"Poor craftsmanship, Reminds me of "" 99 cent store"" merchandise. A couple of years ago, this was a good product, when purchased through a department store. And it does not even come in ""Hi"" anymore."
4,Not for basketball!,"These are really cool shoes, the materials are cheap, they don't lace up high enough. If you're wearing them casualally buy them! But for basketball, you may as well go to walmart and buy some basketball shoes they are awful"
1,Horrid psychological and psychotropic experience while watching this movie,"This movie is probably the worst film I have seen in my life almost as bad as Auntie Mame. I would rather cut off my own tongue, pull out my own teeth, swallow urine, or put a chili powder suppository into my analregion or shower with bleach. Then I would be dead and not have to remember that I watched this movie. Please kill me."
1,Samantha Power's Book is a Problem,"If only Samantha Power, actually did her research and studied the archives of many governments before she wrote a book based on propaganda and on other authors. Samantha Power likes to throw blame to everyone to the Turks who suffered terribly near World War One, to the United States and many others. The Armenians had begun slaughtering and ethnically cleansing the Turks for the purpose of creating an independent Armenia since the 1880s, why does Samantha Power omit such important details about European history? It's important to realize that if we were to take Samantha Power seriously, we'd have to declare England, Russia, and the United States as the masters of genocide, how absurd."
1,Self Righteous...,"Smug and sanctimonious. The way this book is put together...it's like it's more about the author trying to create a perception of herself than it is about the people and events she's describing. I was trying to get caught up in the analysis and arguments, but the author kept getting in my way, like a little kid who's waving his hands saying, ""look how smart I am!"" Kind of pathetic..."
1,One Sided,"Any book written on any subject which has a historical importance and, specially if there are more than one nation is involved, has the fundamental duty of approaching the subject from all directions and angles possibble.Ms Power have chosen to look at this issue from Armenian diaspora's point of view only, yes , there were unfurtunate events took place in 1914-1915 in eastern Anatolia and yes, many people from both sides died, but to lay the blame on one side and ignore anything else is just beyond the fundamental fairness which Ms Power crosses from the page one to all the way to the last page.Choosing a side and writing a book to prove that and during that process justifying the killings of innocent diplomats who were subject to attacks in 70's and early 80's is just hard to comprehend...this one doesn't contribute to anything at all."
4,An important book to read,"I found this book incredibly insightful. The book is a thoughtful narration on why genocide is difficult to confront. From the United States perspective, the author explains why time after time, among different administrations, liberal or conservative, leaders and common folk choose to ignore genocide. What does anyone personally have to gain from stopping genocide? Very little and requires tremendous sacrifice. The subject matter is not easy to read but the author skillfully tells personal stories to make this a compelling and dramatic read. I highly recommend this book."
2,Once again looking to his own belly...,"I think americans should be ashamed. How could someone call ""The century"" something that we could call ""US Century""? And what about all the other great momentus that happened around the world? The book is really good, is excellent. But the name makes no sense! Americans should remember that there is life outside US."
1,The Armenian Genocide,No book reviewing the 20th century should be allowed to print without mentioning the Armenian Genocide during World War One. It was the first genocide of the 20th century. Over one million Armenians were murdered in Turkey. I guess Peter Jennings is very friendly with the Turkish government. I guess the truth is again suppressed. So what's new?
5,"""The Century"" Book Review","This book is an excellent synopsis of highlights of the twentieth century. If you lived anytime during those 100 years, you will enjoy reading it and having it as a reference to many events which occured during your lifetime.Also, in a few years you may have a wonderful souvenir of a ""real"" book because most books will be only published for digital display!"
2,Dick and Jane on leadership,"This book is 150 pages dedicated to some very simple principals. Create open communication, follow through, and treat others as you want to be treated. Do we need 150 pages of cutesy story to get that message across? I don't think so and do not see the value proposition in this book. If you want a good book on getting things done, buy Execution by Bossidy. If you want to learn leadership and communication principals, read anything by Maxwell (I would recommend reading several). Unless you are targeting someone just entering leadership with no skills, I can't see them getting much from this book."
5,Works well for the price,"What else can I say--it works well and is a great value.For those who complain about the problem with going through the hull to mount the sensor: Hey, it wasn't designed to go through the hull, it was designed to go over the side.Knocking this unit because it won't do something it wasn't designed for is unfair and unhelpful.From Keith at:[...][...][...]"
2,Just another JT,I read Johanna Trollope for comfort when the rest of my life seems too complicated. This book fills that need - it is familiar and comfortable in the JT formula - but hardly stimulating or great literature. I wish Amazon wouldn't load up my recommended list with 50 JT titles - I would like more choices please.
2,SLIPPING,Not your usual Joanna Trollope. The publisher should look for a good editor ... Pages of irrelevance. I should have tried a sample first.
2,Worked well for the first 2 months,This vacuum worked well for the first 2 months and my wife adored it. Unfortunately the vacuum quit working on us. I am looking for the warranty book now to hopefully get warranty service on it. If it was still working I would give it 4 Stars.
4,A good robotic vacuum cleaner.,I bought one last week from other place.It is very good for me. I am a lazy guy.Now I enjoy the clean room since I have it.The only thing is the battery. The cleaner only works for 60-70minutes. It needs 4 hours for recharging.The noise is a little big. Of course it is much smaller than the upstraight one. Wish it helps u.
3,What happened?,"I was so excited when I heard this c.d. was coming out then when I got it and listened to it I was so disappointed. It wasn't anything like Spider's last c.d. La Vida de Mi Porbiner, this one lacked heart. It didn't sound like something spider would come out with. But there is a couple of good songs on this c.d."
2,a little disappointed,"It's not quite fair to describe Rosenbaum's latest book as a novel. It actually reads much more like an essay. This is a message book...Rosenbaum has a rather heavy-handed message that he is bent on delivering. There is a tremendous lack of depth or realness in the characters and the plot is overly contrived and uninvolving. The reason is simply that the characters are only devices Rosenbaum uses to further communicate his message. Indeed, the characters are anything but fully fleshed out (no pun intended)...they as well as everything about this book exists for the sole purpose of preaching. Very uninvolving. The message itself is educational and somewhat interesting, but buyer beware - this is an overlong essay...not a novel."
2,Not Impressed,"I bought this book in the interest of getting a sense of the work of some of the writers that Rosenbaum includes in his cast; I finished GOLEMS hoping that the rambling would led to a satisfying end. Neither of these ideas panned out. Reading Andrine's review, I was so relieved to read that someone agreed that book just didn't do anything interesting with its material.Also, based on the little research I've done on the topic and the other, better books I've read that include them, Rosenbaum's golems aren't even golems. What's going on with that? A much better book that includes the concept and some satisfying background information on its history is Marge Piercy's Body of Glass (published in the States as He, She, and It)."
1,so disappointed,I am a fan of Ruth Rendell having enjoyed her Inspector Wexford Mysteries. Face of trespass was not worth my time or money.
3,Not Janell Cannon's best.,"This story ended abruptly and left confused expressions on my daughters and my faces. AT first I thought that some pages were missing but this was not the case.Also, the introduction at the begining made it seem like Fuzzheads are real creatures.Stellaluna and Verdi are much better and truly can not compare to this book.I have three other books by the author and am glad I borrowed this from the library first."
2,"nice illustrations, choppy story","Like two other Janell Cannon books Stellaluna and Verdi, Trupp has great illustrations. That is only one element of the importance of children's picture books -- the STORY is really the main event that sparks imaginations and opens those priceless discussions. Trupp did not do that for us.As others here have pointed out, Trupp kind of meanders pointlessly on a journey that ends rather abruptly. The moral of the story is compassion and kindness to the homeless. I felt that this message was a little obvious and heavyhanded; it almost substituted for an actual storyline. In the end, Trupp: a Fuzzhead Tale comes across as bland and preachy.There are not a lot of children's picture books out there that address the homeless, and for that I must give Cannon credit for trying to touch on the subject."
2,Social commentary,"Add the phrases ""in the mountains of Tora Bora"" and ""burqa"" and name the described city as New York and you have yourself a whole other (intended?) tale. Not great."
2,the kid below me is right,"Basically I just want to say that i totally agree with the review below mine. The story plods clumsily on like a malformed clubfoot, and the prose is dead (it reminded me of a rather depressing hybrid of Kafka and Hemingway: two sleep-inducers). Anyhow if i see Norman around i am gonna make him buy me a drink for this one."
2,over my head,"I have no musical expertiseSchonberg from 100 years ago explains his theory of music chords. I don't follow this well at all.He actually seems to try to make terrible sounding music. (no harmony at all)I probably should have sampled more of his music before I tried to take a lesson from him with this small book.well, i tried. chalk another one up for experience."
4,in three words a grand finish,"this is by far and away the best book in this trilogy.alot of action,some tit for tat give and take,and more detail than the previous two books.I liked the reunion between luthien and his brother the most."
5,oh yeah,"these speakers are probably nolt audiophile speakers but are very good at the price well balanced good effinct bass while staying pretty clean. these are indestructable. they will outpurform bose at any price a definant step up from sony,pioneer,etc and outperform most speakers at twice the price"
5,Fits like a glove,"I mounted this insert to a Kimber compact. It fits perfectly under the grips with no trimming required. Although it increases the grip width slightly, it is barely noticeable and makes up for it in increased comfort and a much better, non slip grip on the gun. No grip bushing change is necessary. The finger grooves are the only part that shows and they blend in perfectly with the receiver on my gun."
3,This is for a COMPACT 1911!,"I didnt read the description carefully enough so I have to send the grip back and get a grip that fits the full size 1911.However, I like Pearce and it shipped quickly. Not their fault, but I wish I would have been a little more easy to see in the description."
1,Barely worth buying,"I started reading this book with high hopes that it would be similar to his NT 4 book, but I was quickly disappointed. Once I started reading it, I thought that the material being covered was extremely basic. I had to skip the first 500 pages because of the poorly covered material. This book would be fine for the person who does not have any prior knowledge of Windows 2000 at all. I finished the book in less than a weekend because of the constant repetition. This book is a bust and not worth the money."
1,Not very useful for the average home decorator,"I came to White Hot hoping to find some inspiration for my home decorating projects, and also to find useful information about how to use color in the home. The book, however, seems more of a collection of photographs that appealed to Tricia Guild--arty, but not very informative or inspiring for the average reader."
1,Not the Supremes,"My first review did not make it. Lets see if they post this one. If you want a Diana Ross AND The Supremes CD where 100% of the songs are of the Supremes, then this is not for you. The majority of the songs are Diana Ross solo songs after she left the Supremes. Only four songs are legitimate Supremes songs.If you don't care then buy it. I like Diana Ross but this is not a Supremes CD it is more a Diana Ross CD featuring some Supremes songs. Let the buyer beware!"
5,Moved me in ways I cannot explain,"My Name is Karen Daigle and I live in Lafayette, La. I walked into a Barnes & Nobles this New Years day looking for something to read. PSYCHIC DIARIES book was among several others in the ""new arrivals"" section. I picked it up, put it down, and went walking around the store.I felt I had to go back and buy it. I can't explain it, I just knew I needed to read it. I went home and read into early morning and it moved me in ways I cannot explain."
5,An Excellent Book!,"Wilson's excellent book sumarizes the findings of virtually all of the factual studies of the consequences of divorce and illigitmacy for children and for American society done over the past decade and more.Those reviewers who have traduced the author are precisely the kind of ultra feminist ideologues who for over a decade have been denying the facts, ignoring the consequences, touting the tired old 60's rhetoric of rights without responsibilities, continuing to insist against all the empirical evidence that divorce is good for the children, and, all in all, burying their heads in rhetorical sand because the reality of the world they have made doesn't square with the prognostications of their ideology."
3,"Pretty item, but............","I received these in about 3 days from date of order. The package was in good condition. I opened the package and found that one of the diamond-netting was comming undone. I'm about a size 13 in pants(which I figured was a plus size), depending on the material, and where I'm purchasing from. Anyway, I tried these on and they are way to big. The black lace that goes up from the top of the stocking and connects to the garter belt has lots of slack in it, and i'd have to adjust about 2-3 inches on the garter belt for it to fit perfect. I'm about 5'3"", and the only thing that did fit ok, were the actual stockings. Maybe I'll just cut off the garter belt, and purchase one separtely to use with the stockings. I guess I'll have to try the one size and see how that works. Anyway, I hope this helps anybody trying to figure out if a PLUS size is for them, because this item's size wasn't for me."
2,Size Issues,This item has a great quality in itself but has a great sizing issues. The one size fits too tight and one size plus the garter band almost reaches your chest besides this a great made item. What a dilemma!
4,a good product,"a good product overall. fun for the children to use.also used in school, allow creativity."
3,Intet Mac Computers!!!!,"I have used Kid Pix as an educator for many years. This year with our new Intel Macs using Deluxe 4 has been a nightmare. There will be sudden freeze ups where no tools can be used. Fortunately you can save the student's work, then do a Force Quit, open the saved document, and then the student can continue working. Also at times when just saving one's work, the computer will come back and say ERROR in saving work yet the work was saved. Also the label function does not work. If you draw a character first and then insert a new background the background goes over the character. If you insert the background first, and then draw a character, you cannot fill the character in with a bucket. You can however color it in with a drawing tool. I hope that Broderbund will update this program to utilize the full power of the new Intel Macs. Otherwise it is time for us Mac users to find a program that will allow students the creativity that Kid Pix used to offer."
1,DO NOT BUY for Mac OS 10.6,"Kid Pix Deluxe 4 simply will not install on OS 10.6. Worse: if you go to the support page, it turns out that, apart from a few generic paragraphs (""quit all applications before installing!"") there is no support available for Kid Pix. None. You're not even permitted to e-mail them for support. ""E-mail support is no longer available for this product.""An absolute waste of money for OS 10.6. I'll be requesting a refund.Shame on Broderbund! I'm puzzled as to why Amazon would sell this. Maybe it works OK on Windows."
1,So quite it doesn't work.,"I gave this product one star since it was delivered on time and in the correct color. After reading all the included reading material, I carefully cleaned every piece and attempted to turn the processor on, and nothing happened. You could imagine my disappointment knowing my cheesecake might not be made that day. Immediately I called Kitchen Aid customer service who prommised to send out a new machine within 7-10 working days. It is getting close to the 10 day mark. I really wanted that cheesecake. Coming from the manufacturer I am optimistic it will arrive in working condition."
2,It's great EXCEPT if you use the discs,"I purchased this food processor about a year ago. It is great as a food processor EXCEPT for when using the shredding discs!! I think it's a poor design. The disc begins to bang and scratch the edge of the plastic cover when I try to shred cheese. The disc seems to easily get off balance. I contacted KitchenAid and they replaced the processor.... but the problem continues with the new one. They gave me another shaft that holds the disc... but the great noise and scratching continue. I bought this because I wanted a small processor to shred cheese (i.e. mozzarella, cheddar, as well as parmesean). It works great using the blades in the bowls. The 3-cup bowl is wonderful for small projects BUT the disc design has to go!"
4,"Works well, quiet.","I mostly love this Kitchen Aid food processor. Have had it a couple of months now and it holds up very well and is quiet. Well built and stylish in the red. I tried a cheaper Black & Decker food processor and it was obnoxiously loud.My only critique of it is the so-called mini work bowl. I was expecting it to be a separate bowl with it's own handle, that I would use 90% of the time, since I'm mostly processing small amounts (the bigger bowl would then be there for when I needed it). Instead, you insert the small bowl inside of the bigger bowl and it's really fussy. To get it out you have to finger it, and as far as clean up goes you end up getting spillage into the larger bowl anyway so now you have two bowls to clean. I just put away the small bowl because it kinda defeats it's own purpose.But the 7 cup main bowl is a nice intermediate size and suffices fine."
4,Texas sized T!,"Great T-Shirt, I wore it to my first Baseball game, @ Rangers stadium of course.The emblem is a bit thick making it a little uncomfortable on a sunny day, and the cotton is also a little on the 'Beefy T' side.The sizes are true to advertised, great shirt... although after 3 months it faded, oh well."
2,"Nice case, bad clip","I liked the case, but the clip only lasted three months. It does not protect the back of the iPhone, which is exposed when on the belt, but the iPhone's back is so sturdy that it does not have a single scratch yet anyway. Still, once the clip breaks, it isn't worth anything."
3,Nice but too small.,"Nice pants, but they run 2 sizes too small. I wear a 14 but they were way too small and the 16s didn't fit either. I can't bear to buy a size 18, but I'm sure they will fit."
3,Ipaq 5900,"I searched long and hard for an ipaq type of handheld. I had a 4700 series with lots of ram and a good processer (600mhz). I am disappointed with the companion as far as speed and ease of use, but, am happy with the size and weight. If you are looking for 'power' .. buy the other ipaq."
2,reviewers remorse,I have since been contacted bythis seller and he seems to have genuine concern as to the condition of the product I had purchased and has offered to refund me for the purchase I am not clear as to how to delete the comments I had left for him but will try to figure it out meanwhile I wouldlike to add that showing this kind of concern for a buyer definately merits another purchase from me should I come across another product of interest to me hoping this is common practice ..
1,What a disappointment!,"I bought this item because I had just bought another GPS and this one seemed to have SO much more potential. Internet access, global maps, basically a mini-computer with a GPS. Well, the GPS really doesn't work. I entered about three different addresses that I go to regularly and KNOW exist and it kept telling me they didn't exist. Then I asked it to guide me to the cross streets near those addresses and again it said they didn't exist. What a joke! The volume is not capable of going loud enough to be heard over music in the car and the display is so small that I was in fear of crashing every time I tried to look at it. There is really too much information on the display when trying to navigate. If this product did what it purports to do, it would be amazing, since it doesn't I returned it right away! How sad!"
4,HP iPAQ rx5915,"Nice little unit. It locks on sats from my kitchen, nice for trip planning. The POIs for around here ( MN Iron Range) seem quite extensive and complete. The battery life on the shelf is good, unlike my Dell Axim PDA, that slowly goes dead in a few days of non-use. I just use the iPAQ as a portable map, the screen is really too small to eye ball on the road while driving. If the TOMTOM GPS is left turned on, the battery drain is on the order of 3 or 4 hours of usful life. And the battery is owner replaceable, one of the reasons that I opted for the iPAQ."
3,somewhat disappointing performance,"While Ana has a wonderful voice and the production/recording quality are first rate, the program selection was disappointing. Many of the Brazilian tunes are translated to English and loose much of their original poetry. This was Anna's first recording and it shows. Pick up Amazonia or other later releases if you enjoy good Brazilian music, you won't be disappointed with her later work."
1,a big mistake,The Dirt Devil Reaction Bagless Upright Vacuum cleaner is the worst piece of junk ever made. The attachments will not stay together. The motor for the brush is so small it stalls out and if you adjust it higher it will not pick up anything. Its just a bad product that I am stuck with. If Dirt Devil had any compassion the would have a recall on this product.....DON'T BUY IT.
1,I wouldn't trust amazons customers for quality movie reviews,"I remember seeing this in the theater a few months after Michael J Fox's ""Back to the future"". And i remember being really disappointed and bored. My friend who was an idiot loved it. Jump to present day and i see its available on blu ray. And the reviewers give it 5 stars. 5 stars? Anyway go to rotten tomatoes or somewhere else for ""real"" reviews of movies."
1,very disapointed......,"I am so disapointed with this stroller. It was between this and the Maclaren, and I wanted to be different! Ugh.....It is sooo hard to steer. The wheels don't turn well. It takes both hands with full arm strength to turn. It is sooo annoying. It also is very bumpy. No shocks what so ever.... For the money i should have just got a cheap umbrella stroller. What a waste!!!"
2,"For such a light toipic as absinthe, this book is dense and boring.","It's like a PhD candidate's dissertation was written on absinthe. Too dense, boring and rambling for a book on absinthe. There are much better absinthe histories out there that provide the same information with out all the pretension."
4,I'm buying my second one,"This is the best smoothie maker I have found for the price. I had mine previously about 2 years. It wasn't used daily but a fair amount. I broke the handle on the nozzle. I don't remember how I did it, I just did it. Because I feel I got my money's worth and it was easy to use, I'm getting another one. I would be nice if I could just replace the broken part."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"This low powered low quality motor cannot handle making fruit and vegetable smoothies. After a couple of uses, the container unit started leaking through the blade unit (I had to sit the unit in a pan to collect the liquid - a mess) and after 7 weeks of use once per day, the motor literally burned out!Don't waste your $50 - save it towards a high quality unit!I would give it zero stars if I could."
1,"Defective blender base, cracks easily","I too own this blender, & instantly fell in love with the power & ability to grind large quantities of ice. I new it was too good to be true though. After about a year & a half of ownership, one day my wife & I were making some smoothies when we noticed liquid running all over the counter. First thought was we assembled the gasket wrong after its last cleaning. So after cleaning up the mess, we took it apart, and discovered a very long hairline crack within the base. At least two other reviewers also had this same problem, so I don't think it was just my bad luck.To make matters worse, the only place we could find replacement parts was from the manufacturer's website. The part is only $7.00 dollars, but you have to pay almost another $10.00 to get it shipped. Add tax, and you're at half the cost of the blender!My recommendation: Pass on this unit due to a potential defect in the blender base."
3,"Makes great smoothies, bad hardware","I have had this product for three months now. My first time making a smoothie, the pour spout leaked! I had read other reviews with this same problem, but wasn't concerned. I was surprised that it did leak the first time however. The option to use the spout is no longer available to me, so I have switched to using the closed cap. I would expect hardware on a product to last a tad longer than the first use, however this doesn't take away from the great smoothies it produces. All in all, I'm not sure I would recommend this exact model to everyone, but at the price, I think it is a good choice."
3,Works well enough,"I have had this product for some time now. It is still in good condition, though I don't use it every week. My only complaint is that it's very loud, even for a blender. Otherwise, its well made. The lid locks on and is easy to get on and off. It looks nice enough."
3,"Great concert, shame about the sound.........","I agree with Tom Davis regarding the sound quality of the 5.1 mix of Lilith Fair. It is the worst attempt at a 5.1 mix I have ever heard. If you select the 5.1 sound track and set your Dolby Digital amplifer to stereo, the vocals come out of only the RIGHT SPEAKER!. The vocals are meant to come out equally from the left and right speakers. The 2 channel sound track sounds much better."
3,Great performance - mediocre sound,"I loved the performances but what a huge disappointment the sound is. I had trouble understanding what the words were for most songs. It's a shame such a landmark concert was produced by hacks. Can the original sound be that bad? Did they only record to videotape. I can forgive the mediocre video for that era, but there is no excuse for bad mastering. Hacks!"
3,It was bought for a gift,I bought this as a gift but the person I bought it for seems to be happy with it.
1,Bloated and goofy???,"What a perverse combo! This is without a doubt the worst recording of this symphony I have ever heard (I have heard at least 20). The combination of an infantile humor in the dance sections with a grotesque portentousness elsewhere is unique in my music listening experience. It sounds as if the conductor is alternately a drunken Bugs Bunny and Von Karajan at his worst. And does the scherzo plod on and on and on...Can this be the great Concertgebouw? They are technically fine, but sound like the backup band for a Jerry Herman show. How did Lenny achieve this? The musicians must have laughed all the way home.It would be a genuine shame if someone coming to this music for the first time judged it by this distorted egomaniacal performance. Instead, try Kubelik, Haitink 1 or Walter. Or for moments of true Mahlerian genius, listen to Horenstein, if you can find it."
2,Okay for the serious fan,"This book is okay for the serious fan. It has inaccuracies and the photo quality is generally poor. No input from Olivia herself. The quotes from Olivia are the best, although you can find all these from magazine articles and only Olivia fan site."
3,Sci-Fi from the Lone Star State,"WOW! Some forgotten 60s films should really stay lost, but this homemade in Texas movie should have gotten released somehow - it's fairly well-done technically but the sci-fi plot about a mad scientist hoping to bring back Adolph Hitler with the aid of a time machine is wildly over-the-top, as is the performance of the actor playing the scientist. Delightful! I'd heard of the film over the years and never hoped to see it until noticing it was now on DVD. Held my interest beginning to end thanks to its earnest cast of mainly amateur actors, incredibly unlikely plot and Tim Holt(!) playing a cop. See it if you've ever loved a drum majorette!"
4,Nice but I wish the compartments were adjustable,"This is a practical bamboo tray because of the multiple compartments. It also expands on one side only. It has some built-in notches to secure the expansion, which is nicer than most of the trays where you expand the tray and depend on gravity or some adhesive to keep it from closing back up when the tray is bumped. There are not too many adjustment points though, but fortunately one of them fit my drawer size perfectly.I just wish the compartments were adjustable. It always seems that the items I want to store are slightly bigger than the tray compartment sizes. Keep in mind that although this adjustable tray (and all the bamboo trays) are shallow - only 1-3/8"" deep, even though the whole tray is 2"" deep."
3,If only it was more versatile,"Though it fits on my drawers well, the compartments just don't hold my cosmetics as well as I would like. It serves its purpose for now. I just woudn't invest in any more of these organizers."
1,The plot got lost somewhere in the webway.,"Watson's prose is its usual gimmicky, convoluted narrative. If his aim was to make the reader wallow in self-obsessed grief along with the main character, he does manage to hit the mark. This book shouldn't have been written. It goes nowhere and accomplishes nothing. It provides no furtherance of the plot established in the original two books. Read the Abnett ""Eisenhorn"" series instead."
1,Emperor help us...,It pains me to think that there are others who even liked the series at all? This is quite possibly the worst book I have ever read...perhaps the worst series I have ever read. One of the other reviewers is spot-on when they mentioned something about Watson devalues the WH40K Universe... Draco is more a pot-bellied rogue clown dumbing his way through realms of the WH40K universe better authors respect...
1,Makes a good sleep aid,This book has put me to sleep every time I had picked it up and tried to read it. There was hardly any action in the book it seem like the author just ran out of good ideas and started to stretch out the plot of the book.
1,Horrible recording quality,"Absolutely terrible on the ears recording-wise, and the choir doesn't sound that great if you try to disregard the recording. I'm glad I only spent a couple dollars on it. Please, don't bother."
3,Are you ready?,"A must read for engineers. The society is definitely not ready to accept the so called ""normal accidents"", but we insist on building them."
5,This book will change the way you think.,This book will change the way you think. It's as simple as that. Really eye-opening and persuasive arguments and examples as to why the absence of accidents per se is not an adequate indicator of a system's safety. Near-accidents are a better metric. Fascinating!
5,Great for stopping camera shake,"This little gem is durable and easily portable. An extra bonus -- attach it to a small digital P&S (I have a Sony P200), keep the legs closed, and use it like a handle. It will really keep the camera from shaking and spoiling low light shots!"
3,Who stole the commentaries?,"My review for the series itself would be 5 stars, but for the DVD collection I must give it three stars due to the lack of commentaries. The first season was worth the price, even though the season is only 13 episodes, due to the informative and entertaining commentaries. I was looking forward to the same in season two, especially from James Marsters. I was disappointed that there were NO commentaries this season - why oh why, Russell?"
4,Captain Jack at your service,"Good character development, for the Sci-Fi buffs only...while funny and offbeat most of the time it has its serious side. Great blown up on my projector screen, more adult than Doctor Who but quirky enough for the Doctors fans to move on to...a hybrid between Millennium, Matrix a smidge of Baron Von Munchausen!"
1,"Good content, but...","Male mate kissing a fellow male mate.. Hey mate, male don't mate with male mate. Male dogs don't mate with male dogs, same with cats, horses and all mammals in the world, why humans want to be the exception and promoted in this show? I know it is science fiction and that is acceptable, but male mate kissing male mate is not good science fiction and it is also not natural, mate. Thanks, mate!!"
4,Very Enjoyable,"Even though it's predictable, it's very enjoyable to watch. Julie Andrews and Colin Firth are wonderful. A good rainy day movie."
4,Very Useful,"Though the set did not have everything that I wanted, it was so useful over the holidays that I was more than happy with the purchase. I ordered 2 sets and was going to give one to my daughter. However after the holiday I changed my mind and decided to keep both"
4,Nicest of the options available,"I have reviewed some of the other artificial plants I have purchased at Amazon poorly, or as rather mediocre. These were the best of the ones that I ordered. I like the V shaped plastic anchor, as it is easy to slide back and forth to get under gravel, sand or other substrate. It also looks reasonably realistic, and serves as cover in the same way that natural plants do. These items will float if they are not anchored, which is why it doesn't get a full 5 stars. Overall, I'm happy with this purchase."
5,Very realistic!,"I just placed these in my aquarium, and I'm very pleased! This is the perfect combo of short and tall lengths. It is also very realistic! The color isn't like that of some of the cheaper quality plants, but blends well into the natural scenery in my tank. My cichlids love it because it gives them a little more security and makes them feel more hidden and safe. All in all, I'm satisfied with my purchase and the value."
2,"The Audio Book is a 80% copy of ""highly effective people""","""The 7 habits of highly effective people"" is among my favourite books which I always read again and again. Same with the Audio Book of ""The 7 habits of highly effective people"", which I have stored in my IPod and listen to it, again and again. So my expectations were high, when I ordered book and audio book of ""7 habits of highly effective families"". I really appreciate the insights for family and partnership in the book, but I was terribly disappointed by the audio book! The author sounds bored, not as energetic as in the original. And the wording, yes, most sentences are 80% same with the audio book of ""highly effective people"". This book would have deserved a better audio book version!"
1,Aluratek USB External Hard Drive Enclosure,"I had to return my harddrive enclosure to Amazon for a refund. The drive enclosure was inoperable upon receipt. I inserted a working laptop hard drive into the enclosure and attempted to utilize it on three different PC's (One a Vista laptop, one an XP laptop, and one an XP desktop). In each instance the operating system could not reconcile the USB connection. I rechecked the hard drive, the setup, etc, and all seemed to be ok. I would be wary of ordering this product."
4,The Early Lins: Popular Samba Jazz Styling,"Thirty-five years after this album of 1974, Ivan Lins would become the sophisticated, mellow, award-winning composer-singer. This early album reflects youthful excitement and the rising popular experimental period following the bossa nova boom. Along with Lins, songs are co-credited to Ronaldo Monteiro, Paulo Cesar Pinhero, and Victor Martins. Lins covers one tune by Caetano Veloso. Arrangements include samba rhythms, American 'smooth jazz' styles, and touches of jazz rock fusion. Lin is supported by a couple dozen musicians, including chorus. The 31-minute long album is good and enjoyable, but musically undistinguished among similar releases at this time. I expect that the lyrics, which, alas, are not translated from the provided Portuguese, make the album more special for Brazilians. Maybe not."
1,the maximum liquid level sucks!,"I just took delivery of this unit and I am horribly disappointed. I got it to primarily make sauces and I expected a 7 cup capacity. Yet, now that I see this thing in person, I see that the maximum liquid line is at 2 to 2.5 cups. How lame! To think that I bought this thing to replace my Cuisanart Mini Prep because it had a small 2.25 cup capacity. Its going back. Darn it, burned again by buying something off the internet.Searching the web, I found that the VFP12BK VIKING 12 cup food processor boasts a large liquid capacity for sauces/pestos. Its a bit bigger and more expensive but I would rather have what I want/need. I will likely order that from Amazon as a replacement to this one that is headed back today!"
5,perfect,"Simple to use, well built, works perfectly. I've had one for a year, and just bought the same model for my mother. I've mostly used it for hummus and shredding cheese. The shredder attachment is really useful."
4,Nice good processor,"I had a similar model and it lasted for four years. I tend to kill food processors and this has been the most sturdy one I have found yet. It doesn't wobble in use. Makes nice hummus, chopped liver, and grates cheese faster than any thing else. Also grates potatoes and other hard vegetables quickly. Nuts, no problem. Haven't used the smaller mini bowl yet."
5,Kitcehen Aid 7 cup food processor,Had it several weeks and am very pleased with its perfromance. A good buy at a good price.
3,Where is the promised ten dollar rebate?,"So far everything works of the Kitchen Aide product that I bought for my wife's Christmas . The price is terrific at 99 dollars but even better with the ten dollar REBATE, which you advertised with the Food Processor.KitchenAid KFP720OB 7-Cup Food Processor with 3-Cup Mini Bowl, Onyx Black"
3,"not as bad as ""Devil in a Blue Dress""","The black racism isn't as blatant in this pair of stories as it is in ""Devil in a Blue Dress,"" but Mosley never lets you forget who his constituency is. I thought the details just a little sloppy, and the stories a little shallow. There is one annoying place where Easy mentions that his stepson is working on a model of a ""one-sailed schooner."" Apparently the author is one of those ignorant people who think ""schooner"" is a generic term for any sailboat. If I had gotten it from the library I would have been spared the cost of buying it, and then deleting it, from my Kindle."
1,A New Christianity for a New World,"This book is an old look at an old view of God. Spong says that the historical, theological, and biblical view of God is wrong. Then he ahead and defines God in his (Spong's) own view, that is that endless and immeasurable love becomes God. He is creating God in (Spong's) image. This is specially laughable because he says that man is now too sophisticated to create idols in the image of god. This book is sophisticated TRASH!"
2,George,"The book is a lack luster read. The author is expressing something along the line of a quick fix for Christianity. I believe the proof is in the pudding or should I say the parishes or diocese. From reviewing the good author's religious career, it seemed his own diocese managed to shrink significally while he was in charge and for that matter his parent church body. I believe it was once said ""Heal thyself."""
1,Yeah right ...,"Yet another protestant bishop attempts to 'save' Christianity by pandering to the demands of the liberal-left. It won't work Bishop Spong; the liberal-left will continue to hate Christianity no matter how you try to distort it in order to fit their creed of political correctness and so-called tolerance. Incidentally, if traditional faith is dying then how is it that membership of the Catholic Church is now in excess of one billion people worldwide?"
1,Killing Whatever Remains of the Christian Faith,"The title of this book should be: ""Killing Whatever Remains of the Christian Faith."" This is classic Spong. If you're looking for anything new besides the same old tired diatribes against orthodoxy, this book will leave you sorely dissatisfied. Bishop Spong...advocates nothing more than a slightly more radical form of 19th century theological liberalism.It is readily accepted by both liberal and conservative scholars that 19th century liberal Christianity died because it sought to accommodate itself to sorrounding cultural expectations and thus lost its distinctiveness and its unique message. Spong now urges other Christians to ""drink the same kool-aid"" that killed his tradition.In short, don't waste your money. But if you like this sort of thing just read some old works by Rauschenbusch, A. T. Robinson, or Paul Tillich, they same the same thing..."
1,A new christianity - might as well rename it as spongism,"How can someone purport to be redefining Christianity, when they are throwing away the basics of Christianity completely? There is no supreme being, Christ did not walk the earth - this is what SPong is telling us. If he is dissatisfied with Christianity, he should start his own religion. As a former Episcopal Bishop, his voice holds too much credence, and he seems to represent Episcopals when in reality, he does not. Everyone is entitled to believe what they want but this is not Christianity."
3,Earth wind & fire in Japan,"I love EWF but I was unpleased with what I saw in the dvd. I myself am a bass guitarist like Verdine White the bassist for the EWF band. Verdine is not playing the bass to the songs. Someone off stage or a recording is being played and he is faking. Like I said, I love EWF very much and always will but if they want to really impress me,show me a dvd of the band performing the ""GRATITUDE"" album in concert. That would be hard to fake. The music was great and Phillip Bailey still got the voice. They are a very energetic band and have excellent showmanship. Over all the performance was ok by my standards but you might feel differently."
1,The good reviews for this travesty are likely from crew and cast members.,This movie is a psychological thriller with a twist at the end. Not unlike my last colonoscopy. It started out exciting with some great visual shots of spacecrafts and planetary landscapes. Then by the time the actor playing the doctor speaks you want it to end. But you can't because your colonoscopy isn't over. 80 minutes of bad diologe that would even make Clooney sound like the lead in a bad high school production. The ending is lame.The reviewers who gave this good ratings seem to know a little too much about the movies financing and budget which leads me to believe that they got film crew and cast members to write reviews.Don't waste your money. Like the producers of this movie did
1,Ridiculous,"Love the Preview that is Given before you rent or buy this Movie. It has nothing to do with the Content, if they actually showed any of the Movie Content no one would even bother.WORST MOVIE OF ALL TIME AND IF YOU THINK A BUNCH OF BAD ACTORS IN A JUNGLE IS SCIFI YOU NEED YOUR HEAD EXAMINED."
1,"THIS MOVIE DOSENT HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THE SIERRA PC GAME ""HOMEWORLD""","FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO LOVE THE SIERRA PC GAME ""HOMEWORLD"" DO NOT THINK THAT THIS MOVIE HAS SOMETHING TO DO OR NOT EVEN HAVE ANY CONNECTIONS TO THE PC GAME.THIS MOVIE IS A VERY, VERY LOW BUDGET PIECE OF $H!T. YOU WILL BE WASETING YOUR TIME, JUST BY WATCHING THIS DVD, OR MOVIE.CANNOT WAIT TO SEE A REAL ACTUAL MOVIE, BASE ON THE PC GAME.MAYBE ""GEORGE LUCAS"" SHOULD TALK WITH SIERRA, AND TRY TO GET THEM BOTH TO WORK TOGETHER, AND MAKE A REAL MOVIE ABOUT IT.THAT WOULD BE GREAT!!!."
1,DO NOT BUY,"If you want to actually WATCH this movie, do not purchase this download. It is NOT a ""director's cut."" It is a ""director's COMMENTARY,"" which means that you hear NONE of the dialog, music, or other soundtrack from the movie. ALL you hear is is the director TALKING about the movie."
5,Best little Cliff Notes on parenting yet!,"What to do about separation anxiety, how to find quality childcare, effective discipline using positive talk or consequences, potty training, thumb-sucking, raising responsible kids, getting them ready for Kindergarten...it's all in here! This is the best Cliff Notes on how to raise a child in the first five years that I've ever found! Even in the back of the book there's tips for giving the right age appropriate gift, and a child development key so you know if yours is acting normal and resources for more indepth reading. I especially found the suggested websites helpful. How many books do you find that give more information about other websites and resources to continue your learning? Parenting POwer has it all. I'm so glad I found this treasure and plan to reread it several more times in the coming years."
1,holy cow,"Ok, I don't have this doll, I won't buy this doll...If I ever have a little girl she will never have anything like this. I saw some girls saying how the doll was appropriate for 10-13 and I almost fell out of my chair! This doll is -IN-appropriate for someone under 21! The short skirts the short tops. How the heck can Mattel think that this was a good idea? I'm 23 years old and I would NEVER dress like that NOR would I allow my CHILD to dress like that. Bottom line: SHAME ON YOU MATTEL!!!"
1,Inappropriate,"I have a younger sister and I find this doll to be very inappropriately dressed. I don't feel that this doll is sending the right message to the young girls of today. This is making them focus more on their body and showing more of it. This is not something I want my little sister feeling as if she has to act like or use as a role model. Plus, this puts more of a focus on money and monetary items you have than morals and hard work. Personally I feel this is a shame to Mattel."
1,Not for LARCENY For the SLUTS,"Was mattel thinking they were making dolls for smurfs?. I'm starting a club called ''Not for LARCENY For the SLUTS'' I'm doing it for the power and the freedom of my scene dolls and to stop all of the wars. Who wants to help and join?rulesone, you MUST be a my scene or barbie fan to joinNeedies1 your name first name or nickname2 age you don't have to3 you must not use bad wordsWho's with me?Amy Rose"
1,Self esteem down the drain,"As if girls in this world didn't have it hard enough, they now have to contend with this kind of toy. The toy tells them to dress in the manner of a streetwalker, and starve themselves to achieve this kind of look. Barbie has never really been the pinnacle of what we could achieve for young girls, but this takes the cake. Where's the pimp that is clearly missing from this toy set?"
2,I saw her,"She was wierd.Madison was too.I prefer to get Chelsea.SARA SIBLINI!!!(SWEET HEART)BRATZ,MY SCENE & BARBIE FASHION FEVER LOVER!!!"
5,This titanic performance teaches the power of patience.,"In the first movement, Guilini takes a tempo slow enough that my immediate reaction was ""He'll never be able to keep this together."" (I'm normally a brisk tempo person.) Man, was I wrong. The majesty and power generated by the dignity of the pacing will leave you overwhelmed by the impact of the movement's finale. The VPO is dead-on, too, and I challenge anyone to prove there was an audience present. In short, stunning."
1,RECALL ON POWER SYSTEM,There is a product recall on the power system for this product. I can't believe it's even on Amazonn... the bulbs apparently were exploiding and a recall was issued.. dont buy this!
4,Cute little tool box,"I bought Bob's busy toolbox for my 2 year old nephew, he loved it and takes it everywhere with him. The books are well made, the box is corrugated cardboard but still durable for the price. I am very pleased with it an most importantly so was my little nephew.."
3,Outdated but Interesting,"First published in 1990, this book consists of profile and case histories of 36 murderers who, at the time of publication, were still at large. The case histories themselves are concise and well-written and should be interesting to both fans of true crime and aspiring crime fiction writers looking for some real-life inspiration for some fictional mayhem. Needless to say, a lot of the more interesting fugitives features in this book (like murderous policeman Gregory Jon Webb and escape artist Theresa Grosso) have since be captured but a few of the people profiled in this book (like mobster Leo Khoury, jewel thief Donald Perkins, and Leslie Arnold, who was a teenager when he murdered his parents in 1958) remain at large after all these years."
3,security box,"This is a nice security box, but alittle too small, it can't hold any documents only say cash and some jewelery thats about it."
4,Interesting film,Enjoyed the film. Even though I didn't agree with the ideology portrayed in the film. Loved watching an original German film in the region 1 format...
3,Atypical Cinema,"If you really want something different, try The Edukators. Interesting not for the acting, directing or film editing, it is enjoyable for the uniqueness of the story...and the ending has an unexpected twist."
3,Requires Knowledge and A Steady Hand,"I'm sure you're interested in this lens for the same reason I was: price. Well, you get what you pay for! Don't misunderstand, this is a very good lens, but it is a manual operation lens. You won't be able to use your camera's automatic exposure/ISO/shutter speed features.You'll have to set your camera on Manual and use an exposure meter (or in my case, guess a lot and keep shooting). While the lens isn't terribly heavy, when it is attached to your camera, the weight distribution is a bit awkward. You'll need a rock steady tripod. You can shoot hand-held, but unless you have nerves of steel and/or a ton of light, your results may be blurry.So: if you're an experienced photographer and know what you're doing, this lens is a good bargain."
3,a creative idea but quality fails to deliver the fun,"I bought this item intending to read the story to my two kids while showing sildes on the wall, so that the two don't need to competing the reading space. Unfortunately, the image on the wall is too small and the quality is poor (even though I adjust the focus). You need to sit within one feet from the wall to be able to see the 2""x3"" picture.The projector in this story bundle is a good idea but is frustrating to operate it. However, the book is still very well written. The story is simple enough for my two pre-schoolers to follow."
2,horrible projector,"My three-year-old has just entered the 'princess' stage, so we've been buying a lot of Disney DVDs, books & toys, lately. This is the second product in one month where we've really felt ripped off by Disney. The projector image is so tiny and blurry, its sometimes impossible to recognize the characters. Its obvious from the reviews that this is the norm, so it seems Disney knowingly is selling a defective product. I would have rather paid slightly more money to have a product that actually did what it supposed to. Buy a 'plain old' picture book instead, your children won't be risking eye strain looking at it."
1,Eye doc says NO,"The film projector has this pin-point, VERY BRIGHT light. If you don't have the film discs in just perfectly (and our fall out if you don't hold them in), the light shines right into the eyes. I showed this to my brother, who is an eye doc and he said it could be damaging to little eyes. I threw the projector and discs away and will just use the book."
4,Fine overlooked comedy still offers chuckles and love,"The DVD transfer is good and the detail is there.This comedy should keep you interested. It flows along with a little madcap confusion over a stature that comes to life (Ava Gardner) and falls for a store clerk (Robert Walker). Walker is excellent as the bemused and bewildered clerk who has a fiance and a new girlfriend. Ava Gardner, as Venus, is gorgeous in her gowns and quite sexy too. Toss in the wise-cracking Eve Arden and 40's crooner Dick Haymes and you've got a very good comedy.Recommended for: Fans of Ava Gardner (you'll love this film), comedy fans, Robert Walker fans. OK for the kids but the youngest ones will get bored."
4,A fun touch of the past,"We don't usually buy movies, but this was a favorite of my husband's and we enjoyed seeing something of that genre. Found it more fun than the movie's we get these days."
2,media demonization,"This movie set out to demonize the Weavers and did a great job of it. Far too many inaccuracies to even begin. While I understand the need to condense for the sake of a movie,this was too much. Saying this is based on the book""Every knee shall bow"" is about like saying ""Ben Hur"" is based on the Bible."
3,It was alright but nothin' special,"I thought the movie would be really fun to watch I mean CEDRIC THE ENTERTAINER & BERNIE MAC and on top of that FREDRO STARR & MALIK YOBA.All the people I mention did great work, but the movie it self weren't that well-written and couldv'e been much better however it was a pretty funny movie.I bought the European Version and missed out on the 4 musicvideos that are as a bonus in the american edition and that pissed me off a little.The soundtrack is better than the movie, but the movie is still o.k. if u don't pay too much for it."
1,Covey ran out of ideas after the original 7 Habits book,"To read this book is to read a whole bunch of totally disorganized magazine articles rehashed into a book.The book does not have any unifying message. There is no central theme. Every now and then there are invocations of the Seven Habits.The number of product and service pitches Covey makes is absolutely amazing. His very overt salesmanship puts off the reader.The original Seven Habits book was a masterpiece. Since then, Covey has been stuck in a hackneyed paradigm that he repeats time and time again. Each succeeding book after 7H sells less and less.Time to let go, Mr. Covey. Focus on things other than the Seven Habits. The Seven Habits is a marvelous work. Do not compromise it with mediocre follow-ons."
1,One of the more preachy books that I have read,"I enjoyed Covey's 7-habits work, and bought this to add to my collection of leadership books. This is one of the most heavy handed, preachy books that I have encoutered. Give me a break! After vomiting, I threw it out. Save your money and try these instead:Leadership Challenge21 Irrefutable Laws of LeadershipGood to GreatFirst Break all the Rules"
5,A Wonderful Book,"I. Asimov: A Memoir is an excellent book. It can be dry at times... but then again so can Shakespeare! I'm a sci-fi enthusiast and a science geek, but this is one of my favorite books by Asimov. You really get to explore Isaac's thoughts, and anyone withany knowledge of the man knows, before even reading the book, that there will be lots of them. I can't emphasize this enough, but this is some of Asimov's best writing."
2,doesn't work,"Bought this since Neutrogena no longer makes its copper peptide cream. I haven't noticed any benefit from Blue Copper 5 whereas with the Neutrogena product I did, and so it others.Don't waste your money."
3,A great read... But...,"When I first picked up the copy for my Kindle, I was wowed to the extreme, and I couldn't help but get more and more excited as the story went on... But then, in the last 1/3 of the book, the story suddenly became unexciting, and the ""climax"" of the book... didn't happen. Don't want to give away the story for those who do want to read, but you'll become disappointed at the story after the first awesome 2/3rds of the book, loose ends not being tied up, new characters introduced then gotten rid of in the conclusion, and various parts that didn't really fit in with the story, that feel like they were just thrown in to boost the word count of the story. I don't think the story's all bad though, as I said, the first 2/3 of the book will keep on the very edge of your seat. 3 out of 5 star rating since it's the closest to 2/3rds."
1,Just another stereotypical movie!!!TRASH,This movie had to be the stupidest movie i have seen ..just another movie done by black film makers making black people look dumb..why not make a movie that is not steriotypical..and then you wonder why you are seen this way..if you want to see movies portraying African Americans in a decent way the way they want to be seen..watch Soul Food it's kinda corny but a good movie with strong family values which is what most African Americans believe in..I do not recommend this movie!!!
4,I LOVE MASTER P WITH ALL MY HEART SO THE MOVIE WAS GREAT,MASTER P IS GERAT MY NAME IS BRITTANY HUNT I LIVE IN HOUSTON TEXAS MASTER P IS A SPECIAL PERSON IN MY LIFE
5,THE FUNNIEST MOVIE IN THE WORLD,I GOT THE HOOK UP WAS A GOOD MOVIE. BLACK AND BLUE WERE REAL FUNNY. ESPECIALLY THE PART WHERE THEY WERE FIGHTING BY THE BRIDGE. I REALLY ENJOYED THEMOVIE AND I HOPE HE MAKE MANY MORE. GOOD WORK P.
1,Absolutey Horrible,"This has got the be the worst movie ever made. I do not recommend this move to any self-respecting human being. Too bad there is no plot, and all the actors are 5th rate at best. Please don't buy this piece of garbage."
3,i'm dissapointed,"I thought this movie was gonna be so good. But I was wrong. It had some funny parts, but the end lost me. That was the dumbest part of the movie. I must give props to A.J. Johnson. If it wasn't for him, it wouldn't have been that funny. And I gotta give a shot out to MYSTIKAL for lookin so damn good!!! Stay up P."
4,Sends a good message,"An enjoyable read, well written, easy to understand. I have always questioned the integrity and motivation of the many clinicians out there who have invented and marketed a new mouse trap. He is right on the money when he discusses folks who get so hung up on minor technique that they lose sight of where they are trying to get. The author presents a common sense and deep thinking approach to horsemanship based on experiences learned and observed. Having started hundreds of colts myself, Marks insights into the nature of horses have added to my understanding of them and helped me to become a better horseman...something we should all strive to be regardless of experience or expertise. If you read the whole book and don't learn something worthwhile you aren't trying."
2,Understandable for someone with a masters in Botany...not me,"There were no reviews when I bought this so I wasn't expecting a lot, but I was expecting something with more general information on plants, maybe some pictures, and information on what plants help with what. It's in very complicated terms, there are no pictures, and it's basically records of what a botanist found after a whole lot of research on different plants. I have to look up all of the scientific words and re-read a lot of it to try and get an idea of what the book is trying to tell me. It is not well written at all, and has theories and conclusions of plants that end up to have no medicinal purpose. Definitely not what I was looking for. It would probably be useful to a hard core botanist, but not the average person looking for clear information about medicinal plants."
2,Difficult book to get into.,"I started this book and found it very slow going. Difficult to get into, difficult to get to know the characters. I read about halfway, and then gave up entirely. I don't know if something important happened in the second half, but now I don't really care. I don't even remember the unmemorable characters."
5,Delicious!,"""Delicious"" is the only way to describe this book. The writing is elegant, the main character's voice is so believable (even though she is in an unbelievable situation), and the attention to detail regarding language, clothing, and food is stunning.Memoirs of a Geisha and Tales of Murasaki, of course, are the pearls of this genre, but The Teahouse Fire offers a wonderful look at lives centered around the tea ceremony. The life is seen from a variety of perspectives, including the devastation to traditional Japanese families caused by the Meiji Restoration.The author's knowledge of her subject is impressive, her writing just superb, and the character development is mouth watering. If you enjoy reading a ""Western"" writer's attempt to introduce a foreign culture so strange to Americans and other Westerners, this is an enjoyable read."
1,Fire in title only excitement in book,I have unabridged audio. 14 CDS and I struggled to get through 3. Tonight I am ejecting disks from player and moving on to something more entertaining. This was dreadfully slow. Was so surprised to see overwhelmingly positive reviews when it made my eyes glaze over. Got so bored it was hard to feign interest in characters.
5,An amazing story.,"If you like anything about Japan or the tea ceremony, then you will love this book. The characters are deep and emotional. You really care about every single one. There are some very sad parts and very happy parts. And the ending is extremely happy, although a little bittersweet."
4,A pleasant surprise!,"An old friend gave me this as a gift recently, saying only, ""I'm pretty sure you'll like it."" Boy, was he right. This is the most I've enjoyed playing a computer game in years. There are enough quests to keep your attention, but which quests you do are, for the most part, optional, and the storyline is only partially linear. You can make of your character whatever you want, so I, for example, ended up playing a thief who was too nice to steal things, but who did a ... of a job in battle. Go figure. :)The only reason I haven't given this game 5 stars is because it makes my computer drag, and after more than a couple of hours of gameplay, it gets visibly and audibly slower. This is a major deal becauase the game is a year old, but my computer is only three weeks old, and pretty close to top-of-the-line, so that simply shouldn't happen. Overall, though, the game itself is so excellent that I can overlook performance issues--and that's saying a LOT."
3,Christmas Gift,"Great author and price, but book was in less-than-desirable shape to give as a gift even though advertised as new and unused."
2,dont buy this software,"this cd cost 250 dollars, it is a plug-in program for autocad. it creats a new toolbar for autocad users to find images. However, i find this toolbar is NOT frinedly to use and it is hard to find images, and this software can't work in autocad 2000, it just can work with the outdate autocad (r13,R14). Further, this software not ever cover different size of common doors and windows. EDITOR, your CAD-library is not powerful enough. I personally believe this software is only worth 50 dollars."
1,Content copied from others w/o giving credit?!,"I learned part of my english by listening at least two dozen times to ""Effective Negotiating"", an 11 tape audio cassette course by Dr. Chester L. Karrass. Since this course is from 1974, I thought I could learn something new from ""You Can Negotiate Anything"". -- Bzzt - wrong! At least 80% of the material in this book seems to be copied from Dr. Karrass, down to very specific examples and phrases. And Dr. Karrass isn't even mentioned in the acknowledgements! I, for one, will certainly not by any more books from Mr. Cohen."
4,Good Audio,"I bought the cassette set. This is a great introduction to negotiation. Cohen's humor, accent, experience and approach make this a fun listen, as well as a knowledgeable set of information. Taking the listener through the games and intrigue of negotiation - including using examples from his experience in government. The need to keep the negotiations in perspective, to recognize the games, tips, techniques and tricks are extremely useful, and the information is still topical - even 30 years after it was first released. A good book on tape - worth adding to the collection."
5,A must read for all - Non Negotiatiable,"Herb has really captured the essence of negotiation. Negotiations are not just for Sales and Businesses. We negotiate with children, wife, friends, when we shop. Everyone negotiates all the time. Putting a structure to this is what Herb has done and really a great gripping job.Must Own!"
5,Effective,"It's the first ""how to"" book I bought, and never stopped buying one. Quick, easy but effective (and funny)."
5,Never Buy For the Set Fee,"Seven years ago, I read to represent myself in a civil case. And I am happy to say that with the lessons in this book, I beat the pants off the defendants.And I was recently drawn to this book because the memories are still with me, and are applicable to anything that I am determined to go after.So, I've tested this once again, in negotiating a deal where, because I had done what Cohen advises, (gather information on the opposition, act like I have time, and know what authority the opposition has), I managed to pull off something big.This is a book to come back to, again and again, to pull out the best in who you are."
3,motion activated light,"The product came with minor blemishes. This product works better than with my 170 degrees coverage outdoor light. However, with its 220 degrees coverage area, I still find some dark spots it doesn't detect. Over all, I'm happy with it but its not what I've expected."
3,Turbolinux Bible,"The book was good, but it lacks how to set up a cable modem. Seeing that linux was built on the internet one would think that linux would spend more time on this issue."
4,a thoroughly enjoyable collection of thumbnail sketches,"Though the hip New Yorker style may not be for everyone, I loved just about every one of these stories. For all the criticisms leveled against Orlean, she has an uncanny ability to capture her subjects and get inside their lifestyle. The range of these stories is what makes them so interesting -- one of my favorites was the simple portrait of a typical 10 year old boy. In fact, I enjoyed the obscure people's portraits more than those of famous people like Bill Blass and Tonya Harding. Orleans is great at picking out the nuances of everyday life that make humans so fascinating. It's the type of book that's best split up into smaller sections. I read it straight through which can get a bit repetitive, but I still found myself reading late into the night to finish."
1,over-rated writer,I found this book to be very poorly written. it seemed to be more about Susan Orlean showing you how smart and sophisticated she is than about the people she should make you care about and want to know more about them. Very boring and no creativity whatsoever.
3,Great display but ages poorly,"I've owned the Apple Cinema 30"" display for several years now and I kept Applecare on it until the warranty ran out. The display is beautiful and provides a ton of real estate on a single display.However this display did not age well. It now has a problem refreshing the screen quickly enough so there is a bit of ghosting that goes on. I've also noted some variation of brightness along the edges. If you get one of these and plan to keep it awhile get Applecare. After that it's probably time to buy a new one. Considering the cost for the display and the warranty this amounts to paying over 600.00 a year to have the display. You decide if it's worth that."
5,nothing short of perfect!,"Owning this monitor so far (two months) has been just wonderful! It took no time at all for me to get utterly spoiled by having a huge space to open multiple documents, multiple programs, everything at my fingertips. Plus, the display quality is drop-dead gorgeous. (And since I spend 8-12 hours a day staring at it, that's a big deal!) I would absolutely recommend this to anyone in the market for a high-end monitor."
1,.,The author tries to be real hip in that jeans-jeans-shirt-jeans-jacket 90s sort of way that made us all smell the teen spirit.Obvious hippy bull. Also it reads WAY too young for teens.
4,Excellent book for teens!,"The 7 habits of highly effective teens is the perfect book for teens. It's a book is a useful guide for teens. It tells what teen should do and not to do. It's a fun book to read. If you haven't already read this, your life is wasted..."
4,good,"I liked the book, it was well written but being forced to read it for school really bored me and i like action and adventure books much more."
5,Great way to learn the 7 Habits,"This book encapsulates the essence of The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People in an easy-to-understand and quick-to-read format. Although I am far from ""teenhood,"" I really enjoyed learning more about these habits through this book!"
5,A real Effecitive Book,I had to read this book for school and do a book report on it. It was so interesting and very helpful. It was fun doing a report on it and it is filled with fun inspiring stuff. It is a real encouraging book. I would recommend it to any teenagers who would like to get their life together and inmprove some relationships. It is an awesome book.
3,7 Habits Teens Audio,"The original ""7 Habits of Highly Effective People"" by the author's Father, Steven is a great book with a great message. And I liked the audio version as well.I thought this would be just as good, and I wanted to use it for a summer leadership program with a sophomore football team. Thought I might be able to just play the recordings, one chapter at a time at our meetings.After listening to it, I decided against that. I felt no enthusiasm or intensity in Sean's voice or delivery. I did not think this would hold their attention (in a group setting) for more than 3 minutes.I don't want to slam this entirely, it might be good if it is you and your teen in a one to one situation, but it didn't work for me."
1,God awful.,"I'm being forced to read this in my grade 12 English class; this would be helpful if you're about twelve, not in the twelfth grade."
1,"Worst book ever, and poorly written.","This book is boring and unrealistic. I was forced to read it, I hated every sentence!The book is also poorly written and you ant findanything in it."
1,Gag me,"If I could give this book a -47 stars I would. I had to read this for a class at school and it was pulled out for four months, and we ""analyzed"" each annoying habit and ""looked into ourselves."" I must say, I am not a better person from reading this book, all this book made me think was how much I would love to ram a pencil in my eye. While reading all I could think of was ""No duh- I know this."" How people don't seem to see the remedial redundancy of this horrid excuse of a self help book is beyond me. A waste of time, money, and brain cells."
1,The worst thing I have EVER read,"One star is FAR too much. This book is awful. I could not even get through it. It's suppossed to be helpful, but it actually lowered my self-esteem. Covey trys too hard to do this right, and he puts in all the wrong things. Why tell us what we're doing wrong? That's how you lower someone's self-image. Why tell us not to react? If you don't react in some way to everything, then you're not really alive. Overall, it's just terrible and pointless. My mom got this for me for my birthday. She wasted her money, and I wasted my time."
4,One jaded writer,"...This book helps build stronger families. I bought it for my 13 year old goddaughter and am waiting for my neice to become of age to get it for her as well. As with the other Covey family books, the brilliance is in the PACKAGING of things that we all know but sometimes fail to put into action. Sometimes, the failing to apply what we know works causes problems in our lives and with our families. What is there to be angry about?"
5,This book is magnifique,"if this book does not help you or touch your life in any way, then you must have a perfect life already."
1,true condition not disclosed,"the seller should have stated that the exercises/activities had already been completed (in black marker, no less)rendering those activities useless to me. the book had writing in it throughout, which affects the experience of the reader as they attempt to do the exercises."
3,7 Habits Miniature,"The message is good, but I was disappointed with this book.This is a much abbreviated version of Sean Covey's ""7 Habits of Highly Effective Teens"" which is a remake of Steven Covey's original ""7 Habits of Highly Effective People.""The 7 Habits books have a great message, and I was hoping to use the 7 Habits in a summer leadership program for a 10th grade football team. I hoped that these miniature books could be handed out as our ""text"" but I could not use it that way. It is not organized with clear chapters that identify each habit by number.This book would be OK as a memory refresher, but otherwise I recommend the original book for the whole message."
1,"Amazon ""Hard cover"" edition is a Miniature!","After 2 attempts I am hoping I get the correct book. The edition listed as ""7 habits of Highly Effective Teens"" - go to ""Formats"" and look for ""hard cover"" for $5.95. DO NOT GET THAT ONE UNLESS YOU WANT A TINI-TINY BOOK THAT FITS IN THE PALM OF YOUR HAND!. I'm looking forward to getting the full size format in the next day or two.As for the Covey Family, You guys are great! I look forward to giving the teen edition to my kids, although they are already great kids! The 7 habit books provide and excellent foundation for any person who wants to make the most of the few years we have on this planet."
1,bad book,I absolutely hated this book. It was the biggest waste of time. Do not buy this book. it will not help your teens.
1,This is horrible,this is one of the worst books ive ever read the 7 habits are ok but sean covey is not a good writer at all throughout the whole book i felt as if he was talking down to me
1,I don't suggest this book...,"I found this book for sale...and asked my mom to buy it for me. She's always been a sucker for self help-type books, so she bought it for me...no problem. I was really excited about the book when I read the back cover and the introduction, but then I actually started reading it. It was...well...everything the introduction promised it wouldn't be. In my opinion, the author talked down to readers and acted like a goody-two-shoes adult, rather than the teen he claimed to be. This book didn't help me at all, rather, it wasted valuable time I could have spent elsewhere.Don't waste your time."
1,Do I have to give it any stars at all?,"I was forced to read this book for an English class in high school and then again for a business class in college. It was the biggest waste of my education time. From what I hear, this book has been very influential in many people's lives, and that saddens me. To me that signifies that good ol' fashion common sense become obsolete. It amazes me that such a large number of people need to read a stupid self-help book to tell them how to live happy lives. How about doing a little thinging of your own?!?!By the time I cut through all the cliques there was nothing left. If the Covey Empire ever came out with a book that contained original thoughts MAYBE I'd pick it up, but for now I refuse to join the cult and would NOT recommend this book."
2,"Everyone of these books is missing pages 1-50,51,52,53?","Hanes Manuals have done well for every auto I have owned, till the neighborhood parts store switched to Chiltons. I paid the price for something wrapped in plastic, only to find the book incomplete and the section on wheel bearings, although indexed, is missing not only from my book, but also several others the parts store checked. I am disappointed, and next time will take the extra effort to either rip open the cover or better yet, continue to look for a quality tech manual."
5,"Rossini: L'Italiana in Algeri / Baltsa, Raimondi, Dara, Lopardo, Wiener Phil., Abbado","Rossini: L'Italiana in Algeri / Baltsa, Raimondi, Dara, Lopardo, Wiener Phil., Abbado is a 1989 Deutsche Grammophon recording under the direction of Claudio Abbado who leads the Wiener Philharmoniker on this comic opera in 2 acts. The booklet contains well-written music notes, all the lyrics, short biographies of the performers and photographs of the performers from the time of the recording. Truly a delightful recording that I very much enjoyed. Highly recommended indeed. 5/5."
3,First one was like rock and roll!,"I bought one cause my cousin did, and it rocked! not that great of turning but it was great. Then it broke... So I got a Fantastic 4 Defender IT SUCKS! it just flies straight. No turning control whatsoever! GET THE AERO ACE, IT IS SO MUCH BETTER AND AT A GOOD PRICE!!!!!!"
3,Discontinued?? <=O,"I'm the mother of an 8 year old... he was DIEING to get the Air Hogs Radio Control Defender Airplane from Santa! So, he did. But, he was so excited by it that he accidentally cut off the antenae and now it doesn't work. so santa's elf took it back to the store for a new one... and found out.. ITS DISCONTINUED!! how can i get one?? its a MUST have for my son."
2,No insight,"I liked the detailed music references, but this novel lacks any depth of character or humor. I would've much preferred a historical account of the Seattle scene and forget the trials and tribulations of the pathetic lead character.Having read ""High Fidelity"", I may have been spoiled, though. And ""About a Boy"" was much better too, if you want Nirvana references. Read those instead - both by Nick Hornby.P.S. Maybe I don't like it because I still can't decide whether I like Nirvana or Pearl Jam better :-)"
4,Well Done,"What easily could have been bogged down by the author jamming his musical preferences down your throat, turned out to be a solid novel with music kept in the background. I was worried when I saw that Brett Easton Ellis was a Lindquist fan, but this book has a story that sucks you in, makes sense and has characters that you can empathize with. In the end, I felt somewhat shortchanged by the fact that some elements of the book weren't expanded on, but you know you've read a solid book when the author leaves you wanting more."
2,"Interesting, but not very deep","This is a book written for the public, in general, but it neither can reach this audience nor the scientific researchers, since it is based on theories that can't be proved in a scientifical way.It's just a book that makes a journey to the world of the mind and tries to bring outside a theory about counsciousness.I think it fails that purpose... Try to look at Antonio Damasio's books - he really can grasp a way to communicate about what consciousness is, and what's beeing done to study it."
2,Broken????,"I received the product in good time, but after 2 days, it broke. I sent it back to the company and now almost 2 months later, I haven't heard from them or received my bracelet back."
4,Ripper - '... And The Dead Shall Rise' (Black Widow),"Texas 'horror metal' band's first offering. Every bit as good as it's follow-up 'The Dead Have Rizen' (see my review). Tracks that more than made me a Ripper fan from the first time I gave this CD a spin are the seven-minute mind-boggling epic ""Night Cruiser"" [opening with some fine organ], maybe the disc's best cut altogether ""Don't Tie Me Down"" (a possible love song?), ""Halloween"" and the head-banging closer ""Metal Mission"" (hey, that would make a great name for a 'zine). Fans of - say Mercyful Fate, Judas Priest, Celtic Frost and possibly Nitro should get the most out of this Italian import CD."
4,For starters,"Norman turns in his usual better-than-average show biz bio, with careful research and lively writing. He leaves off after the death of Brian Jones, which in no way diminishes the book. He also gives a valauble assesment of the Stones' subsequent influence. A very good beginner book about this group."
4,Good For A Kid Mermaid,"My niece is on a big fairy kick, like ...many young girls these days. And of the presents I've gotten for her in recent times, this is one of her favorites. This is great for imaginative play, really. Educational if educating the imagination is what's needed. It also means a lot to her to be able to bring a doll into the pool and play with it, and have that be the ""normal"" play for the doll, because she can't do that with the other dolls.Until I get her more of these. As there's more, it seems."
1,The uglies doll I have ever seen.,EEEEEEWWWWWWWWW!!!!!!!!!!!!JUNK!!!!!!!!!!YUCK!!!!!!!THIS DOLL IS VERY UGLY.BARBIE DOLLS DOSENT ROX LONGER.BOOOOOOOOOOOBOBOBOBOOOOOOOOOOOOBOOOOOOOOOBOOOOOOOO!!!!!
3,"Cute doll, but doesn't work so great","Well, I am a bit disappointed with this doll. The water has to be ICY cold to get the hair & body art to change. I even had ice in some cold water and it still didn't work that well. I did find putting her on the central air vents made her change pretty quickly, but that kind of defeats the purpose of the doll. The body art fades quickly once taken out of the cold water too. That said, my daughter does still really like this doll."
3,GOOD START FOR COMPTON,"I THINK STRAIGHT OUT OF COMPTON IS A GREAT START FOR AMATEUR FILMAKERS. KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK,AND KEEP GETTING BETTER"
2,"OK....But, You had better read This!!","The idea of the size of the game is very cool. The Gameplay is ok, but Verant stopped there. The user interface is not very well put together, not user friendly. The ability to navigate around the interface is somewhat difficult and I have played a lot of RPG's. It is your call, but I would save my money."
3,If You Need to Know....,"If you need to know whether you would enjoy EverQuest, this is the purchase for you to start off with. You will get a good over-view of the game, the feel, the requirements (both time and expense-wise), and the cost is reasonable (comparatively speaking with other or past EverQuest costs). And the first month of the montly fee is free. But the graphics are just NOT up to today's standards. If you like the game, your next choice is to pay out the same amount of money for the ""Luclin"" expansion to get your graphics to something tolerable. Then the prices just go up from there. If you can play and enjoy the game without becoming an ADDICT, then I would say go for it. If you already know you want to play EverQuest, to the possible exclusion of everything else, then look for the higher end of packages and expansions currently available."
5,Great music beautifully performed,"These trios should be in every collection of Classical Music. Lalo was an excellent composer and these are among his finest works. The performances are wonderful, vigorous, nuanced and the recording quality is top rate. If you appreciate chamber music you will enjoy these beautiful works."
3,Decent file box,"Well, it was either this or a much more expensive box, and since my husband and I don't have many files we went with this. I just use it for things like old taxes, etc. In the future I'll probably consider buying one that is water and fire safe, with a better lock. The other reviews are right in that this one isn't very secure. The lock is extremely cheap, reminds me of one of those that are on the diaries for little girls, if you know what I mean. Extremely easy to break or jimmy the lock, and it can't hold a 'ton' of files. But over all, I'm fairly happy with it, it meets my limited needs."
1,Disappointing,Not sure when this was produced but very80's synthetic sound. A real disappointment; not very Celtic. More like 80s elevator music I like the Chandos label but stay away from this title.
5,You don't know how much you need this.,"I don't have much to say because what else can be said about Mozart and his masterpiece. All I have to say is that you need this and you need it now. If you live in a big city find the highest building you can, go to the top of it, and blast this one. If you live in the country, get in the car in a major thunderstorm, pump up the volume, and get ready to be exceeding the speed limit. If you want to get some sense of what it must feel like to be a god, then here is your answer."
4,Keeping Away Prying Eyes,"I'm a college student with a few too many friends that like to screw around it me, so a lock box was sort of a must.I'm not going to say that it's perfect, which is why I give it a 4/5, seeing as the handle is a little annoying and it seems really light weight. I wouldn't trust it against any thief either, seeing as I feel it would be a fairly easy lock to pick (or pick up, for that matter).All in all, it does what it needs, and I would recommend this to a friend if they were looking for secure storage against children or friends. For really valuable items, however, I would recommend something more secure."
1,Dragged on forever!,"This book is terrible... I don't understand how it got such great ratings. The characters were not well-developed and their romance lacked credibility. Even the name of the hero seemed ripped off from another novel. I was so annoyed reading this I didn't even finish. This book put me to sleep! If you want true historical romances, read Diana Gabaldon's Outlander. Now THAT's a real romance."
2,Was not worth the price to me.,"When I purchased this DVD i was thinking a clearer copy of the movies I owned from it, and seeing a few movies I did not own. In the end neither was worth it. Thecopies are about the same as you can find on any Mill Creek product and the few films I did not own sucked anyways. i owned it exactly 3 days before I resold it on eBay."
2,"Skilled playing, cold performances","I found this CD quite disappointing. As skilled as the Orpheus CO is, these performances sound cool and machine-like, hardly Mozartian qualities. This is especially so in the slow movement of the flute and harp concerto which is one of the warmest, most touching movements Mozart ever wrote. Perhaps they could have used a conductor for this one..."
4,Telling Stories,"Phyllis Barber tells stories of many of the mystical aspects of Mormon dogma. She creates the worlds and the personalities who experience the spiritual events Mormons believe God offers to guide our lives.Mormon stories and folklore are an important form of spiritual bonding. Barber's stories tell how these miracles can appear in our lives. If they didn't really happen, they could have, and should have.Christ taught through parables. The storyteller's art is one I honor most highly. Barber does her subjects justice. Her readers will be rewarded.Some understanding of Mormon religious dogma will help appreciate these stories."
1,Did not work for me at all,"Well I do not understand why it worked for the reviewer that gave it five stars. I did exactly the same thing and it did not work for me at all. I mixed it in boiling water and then put it on my hair while it was still hot and left it in for over one hour but closer to two hours. Then I rinsed my hair but did not shampoo it. My hair color ended up exactly the same with no changes. The white is still white and my brown hair is exactly the same shade. It did not work for me at all. I did waste several hours of my day on nothing. Very disappointed.Update: I found something that worked for me. I bought pure henna and pure indigo and mixed them to dye my hair. That worked perfect and my hair is a rich, shiny shade of dark brown (just a couple shades under black.) I recommend that anyone trying to get a shade of dark brown do that instead of buying this product."
3,Depressed? Listen to this!,"Having one of those ho-hum days just like that little round guy on the Zoloft commercial? Place this on your CD, press start, and don't fight it! You will be dancing around the living room (provided you don't fight it, just let it go!). Musically, it is a very fine piece from a very fine artist. It can totally transport you. So many of the tunes you will know from TV commercials, (Rheingold Beer) etc. It is a solid beautiful collection of tunes that can stir the soul. I know it sounds schmaltzy, but if it can make you feel better,why not try it?"
2,"Pop Strauss, et al","I was looking for truly Viennese renditions of Strauss waltzes. Though unrelentingly upbeat, this isn't it. There are medleys of Strauss, Offenbach, Rossini, and everyone else imaginable. It's a pop version of what was once pop on its own. I know Strauss isn't serious classical fare, but this trivializes it."
1,Andres Rieu a classical clown of music,"I must first say that those people that think that Rieu is a redentor of classical music are the same that we see in concerts trying to hold theirs heads up, trying to not fall asleep. It is incredible that some ""conossieurs"" have the balls to say that he is an amazing violinist, when he really is a clown that tries to make classical music into pop music and sometimes he just plays the 19th century pop music and some daring ignorants proclaim that he is the best of classical music just because they dont get asleepy or bored instead they feel like to dance.Is there something else to say???Who cares!!, Im just trying to redirect those possible good listeners into the right way, trying to show the real difference between clowns (Andres Rieu) and real violinists (like David Oistrakh and many many others). I guess that Paganini and the antique Stradivarius Cremona violin makers are revolting in their graves when someone put this clown on the top of classical violin."
5,A classic. Great to read on kindle,"For the price, you can't beat it. And it will nurture your Nature - your soul. Great way to start the day, reading a bit of Emerson, contemplating, and then entering the Natural Dance of life."
5,A wise choice after the electrifying version of Pablo Casals,"I had the chance to watch Mr. Fournier three times, during two decades. I still remember his gentle sound and pristine tune (as well his inspired version of Lalo's Cello Concerto)This version of Dvorak's Cello Concerto remains as one of his most remarkable achievements, and if not for the unique and unsurpassed version of Casals of 1938, this would be my first choice.Highly recommended."
3,"""Interesting""","The third century B.C. chronicler and high priest of Heliopolis wrote several books on Egyptian history and religion; and he wrote them all in Greek. However, these works are anything but the delicate merging of eloquence and history customarily found in the Greek writings of his time. They are, on the other hand, a loose fragmentary compilation of documents concerning religious rites and reign by reign accounts of the great kings and pharaohs of Egyptian antiquity. Manetho's works are interesting; although they are not entertaining or inspiring."
4,A sad reminder of the past,This book brought back the history of the atomic bombs dropped on Japan in WWII. To actually read about the survivors is a jolt of feelings to just what nuclear war would mean to all of us. We need to avoid it at all costs.
4,great reading for buffy fans,"this review book is unlike others out there, while it admittedly has a british bias, i found it to be easily readable and refreshing. it offers a lot of information not found in other buffy books- such as fashion critiques, pop culture references, etc.There are a few problems like lack of pictures, not covering the full 7 seasons of Buffy and no coverage of Angel the series. But these few problems do not detract from how great fans will find this book.while this may be too much for a casual viewer, i'm sure all buffy fans would want to add this to there collection!"
5,Excellent!!!!,This movie was made before it's time. I urge anyone who want to see reality and a real thriller to purchase this movie. The acting was perfect!!!!
5,Why did I buy Harrison's?,"I get a hernia when I pick up Harrison's. I've used it twice this year. I'm a graduating senior, and I've collected all of my upperclassmen's suggestions of books. Cecil's has a bit more info than I'd like, but it's a readable length if you're not a procrastinator like me!It's extremely well written, and easily understood. It stresses only those topics that we graduating seniors absolutely have to have a clue about by graduation, and it doesn't waste too much paper. It's not a pocketbook, but at about half the physicalsize of Harrison's, it's not easy to carry around, either.If I had to buy only one book out of Harrison's, Cecil's, NMS, and Blueprints, I'd get Cecil's. It's well worth the money."
2,simplistic,"Most of the book is about the VB IDE and a lot of the rest is about standard VB code. The sample controls are simplistic. You'd be better off using the online help and code samples that come with VB5 CCE.By the way, CD doesn't include VB5 CCE,so if you don't have it you prpbably will need to download it from Microsoft Site."
1,Terrible product!,"I wish I had checked these reviews before I actually bought it. At first, the product seems easy to use. But adding music and aligning it with the photos is the first trouble. I have approximately 100 pictures in the slide show, which should not be too much for a video that I want to play on TV, but the software gets awfully slow. Saving the show resulted in an error message with a couple of hours of work lost.I thought Magix was a brand name that I can trust. Be careful before you buy it!"
2,Not very easy to use and expensive,"I bought this level thinking it would be great. It is very easy to read the vials, however, when you are trying to pencil mark nail holes or do any marking, this level is way too thick width wise to see properly. Also, DOES NOT have ruler measurement markings when most levels on the market do. I thought the price would be good, but went to Walmart and their prices are better."
5,Awsome!,"I was overjoyed to find that this is more than a book, but a complete software product for color picking in reguards to the web. Inteligently layed out palettes, arranged in value, hue, saturation, analagous, and hundereds of other configurations for the creation of web graphics. Written for implementation in Photoshop swatches, and for other graphic products as well for my mac and pc. I haven't used Pantone Web color since(thanks God)! This is a something I think most web designers can't be without! The palettes alone are worth it to me. I haven't gone wrong with one of Lynda's books yet! Thanks again Lynda!"
3,Standard Tape,"I was looking for a small tape measure to use in the workshop thats not too heavy and won't see heavy duty use. I liked this unit especially because it had centemeters, which I use for small projects. I was somewhat unhappy when I opened the box to discover that my actual tape measure had inches only. It appears that Amazon made a small mistake and placed the picture of product #30-496 the centermeter model into their ad of the #20-495. At this price I don't care too much. I gave it 3 stars because a 5 star tape would have to have a titanium case and blade that never breaks."
5,A diff take on the saga,"This was the 2nd texas chainsaw flick~Much diff than the 1st one which speculates to this day as ""urban legend"" of the plot that may of really happened?This one is really kool w/ the lead female as a DJ & her pal that work late night at a radio station~Once OTIS & leather face show up~It takes off as the carnage begins w/loads of insanity & some funny one liners from OTIS to this day i still chuckle at.This movie in its time had WOW factor...Movies today alot more WOW but if you are a fan of any of the TCM flix this is one that is as good as the others cuz its a lil diff~DENNIS HOPPER dont mess around in this one~Its worth watching!"
3,ehhhh,"i am a huge horror buff. so naturally i would buy part 2. its very b-rated and doesnt even touch part 1 if youre into the actual story of it. but, on the other hand, if you like rediculous, disgusting, horror, you will love this. Bill mosely plays chop top and is so amazing at his character. he also plays otis in house of 1000 corpses and devils rejects. he steals the show. definately check it out"
1,Absolutely awful.,"Compared to the first film this one went off the rails and into the river. They managed to make leatherface look silly, the whole plot made little sense, Dennis Hopper spends the whole movie cutting down wood supports in the compound until his stupid chainsaw fight with leatherface. The whole thing was a disaster. Unreal."
3,Not as good as it could have been,"This movie could have been a lot better, bu it had some interesting twists and was just a good time. It was not a total waste, except some of the acting was not good, and some of the characters could have fooled me, I though some of them could have been made from cardboard, and just moved around by the rest of the cast, but other than that, this was a totaly enjoyable movie. It had some scares, but they were few and far between, and the last scene I found quite cool! I liked how they fought with the chainsaws, only...how did the sheriff hold onto the chainsaws?? He had one in each hand...a bit hard if you aks me. But it was entertaining non the less. Not the best in the series ( by far ) but better than some. Probaly 3rd best in the series. A good movie. I reccomend it if your in the mood for a good time, but if you want to be truely scared, see the origional one first."
3,Dennis Hopper with a chainsaw,Dennis Hopper made this work. A ok sequel to a great movie. just dont let everything else get into your head. the chainsaw wars are great. Tobe Hooper is truly a horror master. not fot the squeamish.
4,"Fun, campy, gory",This movie okay in the tradition of low budget sequels. In fact this movie was far from low budget. Actually i was impressed. This movie had great special effects for the low budget stop motion super eight era of the early eighty's. So if you want a fun movie that ages 10 to 22 will enjoy this gory scream/bloodfest is just the movie for you.
4,Pretty good,"I think this is one of the original 80's sequels. It has everything a sequel needs; suspense, good big chasing, action, a chainsaw duo, lots of running and screaming, classic 80's music always playing in the studio scenes. This is probably the best of the chainsaw sequels, this sequel is the only sequel that still has the same family from part 1. See it, it's a must for fans of the series."
1,So bad it's...bad.,"I don't need to add to the chorus of 1 star reviews here, but I'm giving it 1 star anyway in defiance of all the 5 star reviews here. 5 stars, people? Really?To call this a blemish on the franchise is an understatement. Actually, there's really no way to OVERsate the crappiness of this film. I avoided it for years, until I finally gave in. This is not 'so bad it's good' bad, this is 'when i'm on my deathbed I shall curse this movie for wasting two hours of my life' bad. Preposterous and corny, Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 will leave you wondering exactly who the target audience was for this abomination.The character of Chop Top was about as 'scary' as Beetlejuice. Leatherface 'falling in love' has already been discussed a hundred times in the other 1-star reviews.Don't waste your time. This is a film not worth the 'benefit of the doubt.'"
1,Leatherface In Love,"Sheriff and local radio DJ try to put the word out to the public that Leatherface and his deranged family are at it again after a recent killing, well the family is not too happy and goes after the DJ and leatherface falls in love, we get to see one scene that is the same as the first film, lots of horrible screaming that is overacted from the DJ, a battle of saws between Sheriff and Leatherface & an ending that leaves you thinking thats how they ended it? this was suppose to be a satire, black humor but I didn't find it funny, just a bunch annoying over the top villians trying to be funny & alot of awkward momemts. its like a bad carnival show that apeals to the eye with its production design but it fails with its bad dialogue and not being scary, shouldn't even be considered a sequel to the original texas chainsaw massacre."
3,Sloppy sloppy sloppy...,"Having seen what the laserdisc offers for Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2, I am well dissapointed with the feature-less DVD. What were they thinking - it could have been a great must-have DVD for fans of Leatherface, but instead theyve made it your bog standard release with the all too familiar ""Interactive Menu, Trailer"" as the Extras highlights. Good film though, and if you dont have a laserdisc then no doubt you would want to own this if you are a fan of the series. Its just dissapointing.Pathetic."
4,Decorating ideas for the clueless...,Offers clean crisp ideas for people like myself who are clueless to decorating. I believe the ideas are easy to emulate. Have gotten and used some decorating tips. Plan to make it a permanent issue on the night stand reading collection.
5,Excellent,"Not only for the facts but also for the standpoint and the honesty of the author in expressing his way of reasoning.I am a Spaniard and warmly recommend it to Europeans... even more so to anti-American Europeans, that could change their mind..."
2,Overrated,"It's not easy to criticize this books footnoting. Because there isn't a single footnote!He includes a bibliogaphy at the end, but without eve including page numbers at the least, we have no way of verifying if he's using his supposed sources at all, let alone faithfully.Completely overrated as a book."
5,A must read for all Americans,"As a history major at the University of Memphis, I have found this book indispensible in my studies. Everyone should read it not only to get a true sense of REAL American history (as opposed to the mickey mouse history taught in highschool and on the history channel), but the book also gives the reader numerous examples as to why it is so important to study history and not just the mythology you're handed in school. One can see events repeating themselves over and over again in American society due to the blind eye cast at history. The solutions of the problems of today are best found in their origins."
2,"Not Really History, But Provocative","Silly effort to preach to the pc crowd leaves a lot to be desired as history. This may, however, encourage readers to seek out actual historians and scholarly works. Not a total waste of a serious reader's time, but hardly worth more than a quick glance. I was not surprised that on a C-SPAN history roundtable, not one writer or historian (not even Gore Vidal) had heard of this Zinn when an audience member mentioned him."
2,All ideology aside ...,"... am I the only one who thinks that this book is just extraordinarily poorly written? The syntax, the staging, even down to simple punctuation. It's a nightmare for anyone who may expect [pseudo-]scholarly works to exhibit at least a modest appreciation for the finer rules of prose."
2,A 700 page long superficial judgment of history in the US,"I was only able to read 3-4 chaptes of this book.There are two main problems with the book. (1) The insights are not surprising, and (2) there is hardly any evidence of worthy research behind the opinions of the author.He often cites completely absurd sources to make a point, like a bumpersticker in 2000 or ""one person writing in the Gazette in 1764"". I am sure you can prove anything if you can argue with ""one person once said"".I was expecting from a book on the ""history of the people"" to trully investigate how ""the people"" have felt and lived history in this country. What you get, instead, is how the author's modern western and quite leftish view of things perceives history in hindsight. Quite a different thing.The book doesn't read like the work of an academic, but rather, like an angry ultra-left superficial view of the world. The kind of writing one finds in free weekly newspapers like ""Citypaper"". At least those editorials have humor!"
3,Good Read...in paperback,"First, the book is a good read, and if you remain unbiased, you can credit Zinn for his views, and appreciate he leaned a little (well, a lot) left of center.But folks... the paperback is 50% the cost of the kindle edition.This is a kindle e-book to ban."
4,Just enough to keep from rebelling,"This book is fantastic. It kept me interested all the way up until the last two chapters where it began to talk of the Clinton and Bush administrations, which I'm not excited about reading. Nevertheless, the rest of the book caught my attention. His thoughts about the middle class acting as a buffer between the rich and poor and also acting as guardians for the system set up by the rich is downright interesting, and, is worth exploring. He also claims that just enough is being given to the masses to keep them from rebelling. He emphasizes the role of the military and how it has secured an empire by essentially invading other poorer countries. He makes the government look like an immoral tyrant. All in all, it is a damn good history book."
3,Read only as a supplement to other works!,"This book tells of many events in the history of this country that we would all like to forget. The hypocrisy of our government and its citizens is undeniable. The stories in this book should be read, but should not be the only source of history. For all our faults, we still live in the most tolerant and free county on the planet. We need to read and learn from our mistakes, but not dwell on them."
5,Irresistable!,"Two classic concerti that are played to perfection! My one slight reserve would be the recorded sound where a bit more ""lushness"" - particularly in the Bruch- would have been welcome; but that is a very minor cavil. Cannot imagine any music lover not enjoying this disc."
4,Almadovar's last is probably his best.,"This is a deeply moving film, beautifully filmed and superbly acted with several interlocking themes: the beauty of women, the importance of attention to and care for those in a coma, the relation between science and mystery. The plot has many twists and ironies abound. Lacking the over-the-top humor of such earlier films as ""Women on the Edge of a Nervous Breakdown, it impressed me as the most mature of Almodovar's films that I have seen, both artistically and thematically."
5,On My All-time Top Ten!,"I've watched this film, probably 6 or 7 times, and each time, I've walked away with something new.Almodóvar has brilliantly weaved together this new masterpiece by incorporating silent film, music, ballet, flashbacks, and scenes shot out of sequence to come up with a seemingly simple film which will surly stick with you for a long time.Telling you the plot would be pointless, this is, in my opinion, one of those that you just have to watch, having no idea what's going to happen.The acting is exceptional, the character's are unforgettable, the script is perfect, the pace is such, so as to keep you guessing, but still allows time for all the subtle elements which makes this such a rich cinematic experience.Don't hesitate with this one!"
1,What a waste,"This game has the potential to be fun. Unlike others who say this is ""dumbed down"" from the first one, I thought the the original B&W; spent too much time forcing the player to set up cities and play the game with limited resources. This does correct some of the imbalance and allows for a more direct way to conquer other cities (namely, armies).The problem is this sequel was designed like an after-thought. It, quite simply, doesn't work. My specs exceed what is needed - however, the game (and this is from forums dedicated to it) was not designed to be compatible with Windows XP, let alone Windows XP 64 Pro (which is what I run).The result is that every time the game gets interested it crashes. Not to a blue screen, not directly to windows, but instead freezes, takes forever to get to the Windows Error screen, and then forces you to restart and go through the entire intro again.So, no matter how much fun and pretty the game may look, it's unplayable."
2,Gives you a killer headach,"I recently purchased this game for my new computer. What a let down! I played the first Black and White and really enjoyed it. I spent most of my time zooming in and out, tilting the view, and trying to select people/items involved in the game play. The tutorial part of the game is WAY too long, and the conscience characters are extremely obnoxious. You are not able to interact with the character nearly as much as I would have liked too. The game also runs very slowely, and I had serious problems with the graphics (during movies, especially). I would recommend sticking to the original version."
4,Did good overall.,"The game was great, and was sent in great shape too, though it had a few glitches like all games i loved it all in all. Good job all and ty very much."
1,"Tedious, Boring, Very Buggy","This game was not at all what I was expecting. The building menus are poorly designed. Early in the game, when there are few buildings available, it's not a factor. Once you start upgrading, though, you have to click through long, unorganized lists to find what you're looking for. Meanwhile, things are happening you need to be paying attention to in the world. The dialogue with your conscience angel and devil are excessively long winded, and you can't skip them. If you ever restart a game, you get to listen to the same unbypassable tutorial every time. Also, on windows 7, the screen will randomly go black and shut off, requiring a reboot. Oh, and creatures are more annoying than useful.Complete waste of time."
2,not what I was looking for-,I have always like EA games in the pass but this is one I should of skipped over. My main issue is this game is too much trouble to play with a mouse and just setting it up was a waste of time. I read trhe reviews before I purchased it and this is not the 1st time I bought something that had postives reviews but turn out to be a waste of both my time and money. If I though I could return it and use my money onsomething more to my liking them I would- an example of a great game is Dragon Age.
4,Tales of firefights by someone who (barely) survived them.,"Miller recounts his days in Vietnam fighting with F Co., 58th Inf. (LRP), 101st Airborne, and later, L Co., 75th Inf (Ranger), 101st Airborne. A must-read for nonfiction fans of SOG units in the Vietnam War. Also recommended: ""Eyes of the Eagle"" and ""Eyes Behind the Lines"", by Gary Linderer. If you ever meet Mr. Miller, please shake his hand for me."
4,Recondo review,"Larry Chambers provides a authentic, gritty and raw memoir of a year in the life of a US Army draftee to the Viet Nam war, who volunteered for assignment to a long range recon patrol ( LRRP ) unit in an infantry company of the 101st AirborneDivision. His account includes his training at the Recondo School aka ""the deadliest school on earth,"" and his service in a six- man unit that was routinely inserted deep into the bush and engaged much larger enemy forces. It is a bitter sweet account of one LRRP's experience including his detailed impressions of the feel, taste, smell and sounds associated with the horror and the mundane. The reader gets a sense of the incredible valor that our soldiers displayed in combat, as well as the hardship and irony of their service and return home. Needs a little polish, but a good read that would make a great movie."
4,Graphic SF Reader,"A definite twist in the tale, as things begin to go haywire for Deena. A nutso superhero with Superman level Powers has caused very very bad things to happen, and the government has cracked down severely on Powers, much more so than before. Of course, when that happens, guess what happens to Walker and Deena. Nothing is ever going to be too easy for them."
5,Wherever you go - take this book.,"This is a great, non preachy, non religious approach to finding your center, and making peace within a hectic environment. I got the book for myself, but my husband, who is an atheist, loves it and uses it as much as me. very good tips on finding quiet time in a noisy world."
3,A comprehensive guide,"I read it as an introduction to mindfulness. It is helpful, but much more comprehensive in scope. I expect to continue to appreciate it as I progress to more advanced issues."
5,I found myself again with this book!!!,The langauge in which this book is written so clear and effective it is actually amazing. How Jon Kabat communicates such a foreign consept so easily and effectively. I couldnt believe how quickly I learned how to focus and be in the moment and enjoy the moment not worrying about what's next.
4,Insightful and Practical - Inspiring,"Insightful and easily adaptable is my description of the authors suggestions in this book. Jon Kabat-Zinn describes simplistic methods on self awareness in a mellifluous writing style that is pure pleasure to read. As a meditating novice I found the information to be practical and extremely helpful in diminishing the stessors of daily life. However, with any self awareness or motivation book, to realize benefit the reader must challenge himself or herself to incorporate the learned material into their lives. I suggest highlighting inspiring points so they may be easily read again and again."
5,a new way of being,"For those of us who suffer from stress and anxiety thanks either to simple, everyday living or a one-time, traumatic event, Jon Kabat-Zinn offers a meditative approach called mindfulness. Based on his work in a stress clinic he founded at UMass medical center 30 years ago, mindfulness offers an entry into full wakefulness and focus that seems achievable through practice and dedication. The book itself is terrifically gentle and his prose evenhanded and engaging. There are tapes which offer meditative exercises based on the text, too."
4,Great book,"I work with at risk youth and and their families, its a good tool and resource to own. Give good insight."
5,Mind-full,"Explore the new realm, of your mind. Becoming aware is the first step to solve any problem. If you do not know there is a problem, how can you fix it? This book is the prequel to, You."
5,The best book I've read on this subject.,"Written by two nurses who understand the questions patients have before and during chemotherapy or radiation therapy, this book is very easy to read but doesn't skimp on technical details when necessary. The chapters cover basics about the treatment, how to deal with side-effects, getting good nutrition, support, and bone-marrow transplants. I work at a Cancer Center and our patients really like this book because it de-mystifies the process and helps guide them through from beginning to end. There is comfort in knowing what is coming and they feel reassured to know that there are ways to deal with just about everything that may come their way. Since our patients are usually very interested in mind/body techniques during chemotherapy, I especially like the chapters on Mind/Body techniques, relaxation and visualization. The authors seem to know just what patients are looking for and what they need."
2,When it worked it was great... but....,"It actually lasted a bit longer than some of the other reviewers, but the motor did crap out after about 6 months. I bought one for my friend as a gift, her's lasted a day. Don't waste your money.I'm going to try the Cuisinart Compact Smoothie Blender. $40 more but I bet it's well worth it."
2,Used 6 times and died.,"After six uses, the motor burned out. Awaiting replacement. May be OK for light duty use, but not as advertised."
4,Individual blender,This is great to make individual smoothies and take with you. The bottles fit in the car holders.
4,Great little blender,I bought one for each of my five children - four who are in college this year. It's great for making smoothies and protein drinks.
4,good product,I am disappointed that the bottom of shake and take bottle does not come apart to clean. Otherwise good product to use.
3,Pretty good,"Piranha,a 1970's classic about chemical's getting into the river and making the piranha's much worse than they normally are.Some chick and an old dude try to save people from the man eating Piranha's.Pretty good movie,if you are into this stuff."
3,A very good portrait of the philosopher and survivor,"Primo Levi, an Italian Jewish chemist, apparently committed suicide in 1987, after writing several books about his life and his experiences at Auschwitz. Why would Levi, who was like the Italian Elie Wiesel, commit suicide after a life of bearing witness and surviving a death camp? Did he feel survivor's guilt? Did he feel that only the good died, and the bad were allowed to survive? This major biography by Anissimov, the French journalist, delves deeply into the life and mind of the controversial Levi. Why did he feel guilt? Why did he feel misunderstood? Did people die and suffer for nothing? Did he continue to suffer in Turin after the war by caring for his blind and senile mother and mother-in-law? Was he right in thinking that the Holocaust will become just a forgotten footnote in history? This book begins to answer some of these questions, and paints the first of many portraits of the post-Holocaust philosopher."
2,Someone swapped their nitrous tank for helium....,"Don't spend your money on this if you want to have a really quality Dead recording. When it was mixed to cd, it seems that the synch got screwed, because everything is a little bit too fast, and Bobby and Jerry sound more like Alvin and the Chipmunks than you'd want to hear - especially since the track listing is great, and the jams they recorded were excellent. I find it to be a good background disc if you don't listen to the vocals, or just sing over them yourself. Morning Dew is definately the highlight for me, but if you listen to it clear-headed, you'll keep wondering how they got recorded before puberty. Good playing guys, but bad form you lame import cd companies. Fix the speed on the tracks, and I'll buy it again."
4,Quality product and quick delivery.,The product was of good quality and packed appropriately. I couldn't find this replacement filter at any local retailers and it was delivered to my door in a short period of time.
4,ok,"I can't really rate this cause I bought the wrong sizes and just had to cut them to fit. It work okay, but does make my machine make a loud noise."
5,1958 Book Confirms the Worst Interpretation of Academic Life,"Now, if you've spent time around Academia you've almost certainly had the idea that it's really a kind of mental illness. If you're in academia, you've long suspected this, but you also think that anyone who says this is experiencing ""sour grapes."" Who knows?Well, this 1958 book confirms the most cynical interpretation of the academic job market. It was written in the boom years, when there were too many position and not enough people, but the persuit of prestige uber alles and the moral hazard engendered by tenure are well documented in this work. I'm sure it was popular among critics of higher ed when criticism of higher ed was fashionable in the 1960s, and now that criticism of higher ed is fashionable again, perhaps a new generation of readers buy used copies for a bargain price.So if you ever thought it was just you, buy this book and you'll see you're not alone."
2,The Same Ole' Same,"The first book I read by E. Lynn Harris was ""And This Too Shall Past."" An excellent book. I give it five stars. Since that particular book was so different than any book I've ever read (especially the strong homosexual content), I decided to read another E. Lynn Harris book. This time, I got ""Abide With Me."" Hated it. It seemed like a repeat of ""And This Too Shall Past."" I am not against homosexuality, and I do know that Mr. Harris is a gay writer, but personally, I feel he gets to detailed with the gay love scenes, and I just haven't gotten use to reading such material. Unfortunately I don't think I'll be reading anymore books by Mr. Harris, but I do hear he's doing the screen play to one of my favorite movies, ""Sparkle,"" so hopefully he wins me over with that."
1,Romans 10:9-14 - confusion was not part of His plan.,"I think this book clearly expressed a lot of confusion. These characters seem to not have a clear understanding of where they stand. Confusion was not part of God's plan. Homosexuality is abnormal. It's clearly a chemical imbalance. Yes, It's too harsh for the media to admit but it's the truth. Justifying it is not a cure. We were created either as man or woman not both. Emotions can be controlled - having emotions for someone of the same sex doesn't mean it's normal.Get real! Stop justifying every mess that we claim to be truth. The truth is that woman was created for man (conversely).Our actions will be judged - let's live right. E. Lynn Harris knows the truth. He needs to stop writting rubbish."
5,Eye opening drama for ya. Page after page,"I was hooked on E.Lynn Harris from jump street. I read everyone of his books in 3-4 days. Abide With Me was supreme...I couldn't put it down most of the time. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a serious DRAMA! That Yancey was too much and got exactly what she deserved...NOTHING. How could she and Ava be so coldhearted toward Nicole. That Basil Henderson is a true piece of work full of himself and BULL too.I look forward to reading about him constantly, and think he needs a book dedicated totally to him. Seeing Raymond struggle with issues of commitment, love, and truth was heartwarming. I found myself being his and Nicole's personal cheerleader. I'm glad they became friends again and that both are happy. Ava's hatred toward Nicole was so real and typical in showbiz. Blaming everyone and everything for her non-success.I feel like I'm in the story at times. E.Lynn knows how to capture his audience and keep us........It's soooo abiding.."
3,Not as good as previous books,"_Abide with Me_ continues the story of Raymond and his family, Trent, Basil, Jared and Nicole that Mr. Harris started in his previous books. This is definately not the best of them; although it is still entertaining. The subplot with Nicole and the budding starlet Yancey wore rather thin. It seemed like it should have been obvious to Nicole what Yancey was about. Nicole never came across as really naive until this book. It also seems like there should have been more in the book about Raymond's lover, Trent. Basil played the best part in the story - but the ending was disappointing. Like Mr. Harris' other books, many of the characters came off as a little to perfect - too rich, etc. Overall, I would consider the book definately worth reading, but it should not be a person's first introduction to Mr. Harris' work. I would recommend _And this too shall Pass_ or _An Invisible Life_."
4,An Absolute Delight BRAVO You did it AGAIN!,"I loved this book. Much like the others (Just as I am, Invisible Life, And this too shall Pass) I thought it was well written (as always) and once again we got to see characters that we the readers feel like we've come to know. Personally I felt Nicole was a bit too naive with the whole Yancy thing but aside from that no surprises. Basil has given me that whole love/hate thing and Raymond is his usual sweet self. I felt his pain and betrayal with Trent. I don't know if that marks the end of this saga with these characters but I have truly enjoyed reading about their trials and tributlations. It will be like saying goodbye to old friends. Keep up the good work! I'm looking forward to the next book. I am a loyal E Lynn Harris fan and as long as you write I will continue to give you my financial support by buying and my moral support by writing/reviewing. God Bless you"
4,Very good reading....hard to put down!!,"I had to read a couple of E. Lynn Harris's books before I could truly get into them. Once I did, there was no stopping me. Abide with me dealt w ith many issues including infidelity coming to light. It is true he has many gay issues in his books but love is love no matter who it is between. This books deals with couples and the problems they have to deal with. I enjoyed this book better than the others he has written. He always leaves the ending as an opening for another book which I hope will come out soon."
2,Abide With Me....very disappointing!!!!,"I have read all of Harris' books and usually I can't put them down because they are so good. I end up reading them in a DAY! But this book took me about 2 weeks to read and I was in no hurry to finish it. Raymond's plot kind of left me hangin'! This book was ok at the beginning, but the ending seemed rushed and I felt as if there was no closure. THIS BOOK IS NOT AS GOOD AS THE OTHERS AND DON'T BASE YOUR LIKING FOR E. LYNN HARRIS STRICTLY ON THIS BOOK BECAUSE IT WASN'T HIS BEST. Some publisher probably rushed him into writing it. Oh yeah, without Kyle in the novels...things just aren't the same. Miss Kitty and Peaches cannot take the place of Kyle."
5,A Better Understanding,"I loved this book. I am a recent college graduate. I admit that I never ever completed a book in my last 20 years of schooling, but this one had me strapped to it's pages. I loved the evolving lifestyles of the characters. I found it captivating how the author kept me turning pages without losing interest in any of the characters. I now have a better understanding of homosexuals and too know that homosexual relationships can be filled with as much love, affection and quality as any other relationship."
3,"What happened, E. Lynn Harris?","Suffice it to say, reading the entire book was tedious as it was boring. As a devoted fan, I would have to agree with just about everything all the other reviewers have said. The ending was most bizzare and questionable, in fact, just ill-conceived. Did he really think it conveyed closure of any sort? I don't think so. What happened to Raymond's father? Nicole and Jared? Peaches? and most importantly, Basil? I think I would have just felt better if Mr. Harris did not write this book."
2,Did not hold my attention,"Reading ""Abide with Me"" was a little disappointing, in comparison with E.Lynn's other books. I think the main focus was suppose to be on Raymond's character, but Basil and Nicole kept my interest more. However, I felt as if Basil's lauguage was too foul; E.Lynn could have used other discriptive words to help express this character's emotions. Overall, the 350 page story-line was too-the-point; and easy to put down."
2,Disappointing,"E. Lynn Harris is a terrific writer; however, he should have left well enough alone. Abide With Me at times seemed to be wandering without a point. If you have never read Mr. Harris' books before don't start with Abide With Me because you may never read his other works which are not mediocre."
5,I really think it's my favorite movie of all time!,"Fine adaptation of Tennessee William's multi-layered play (an improvement in fact), and terrific performances from Woodward, Brando and Magnani (perhaps the greatest actress in cinema history)."
2,What a Drag !,"Such a slow and boring movie. Absolutely NO chemistry amongst the artistes. One of those ""bad"" movies of Marlon Brando. If not for Marlon Brando I would gladly miss this movie !"
2,Disappointed,"The player sticks regularly and then jumps several songs ahead when it finally recovers. The charging is inconsistent, it will say it is charged when plugged in and then the battery indicator does not reflect a full charge... is it charged or not? The controls are clumsy, especially to turn the IPOD off. Currently, my ""Hold"" button will not disengage so all buttons are inoperable. I called Apple support and all they would talk to me about is buying an extended warranty (my 1 year is not over yet). I need to send the IPOD back to Apple at my own expense. It does work ok as an external hard drive.This really isn't a very good product especially for the price. I'm back to using my old RIO."
2,"Smartly Compiled, yet...","A true Prokofiev aficionado will find Rozhdestvensky's rendition of the EGYPTIAN NIGHTS, op.61 - made with the Leningrad Philharmonic, when Mravinsky was still alive(!) - much more inspired. Listed at:http://www.prokofiev.org/recording/album.cfm?aid=000726,it originally appeared on a Soviet MELODIYA/MEZHDUNARODNAYA KNIGA LP (33 D-010331-2), but unlike the ON THE DNIEPER suite, op.51, the masterpiece in question has never been transferred to a CD."
3,interesting pieces,"Some of the pieces are really unknown, like his incidental music for Hamlet. Unfortunately they are forgottable. The most interesting is the cantata for Staline, where the lyricism is almost overwhelming, but with such a subject, it makes a strange mix. This piece desserves to be heard by the Prokofiev lovers. The performance is not fantastic, but reasonably good."
4,Back from the darkness,"Most people recognize Herschel as the man who discovered Uranus, & his musical career is glossed over. What they may not know is that he was a major figure in the English musical scene just before the American Revolution. As both an amateur astronomer & the husband of a wonderful lady who reads G. Heyer's books, I was happy to learn that his music was being played once again. Herschel's symphonies are stately & flowing compositions, perfect background music to writing or crafts."
2,Simply Overrated,"Okay. Let's agree that the Berlin Philharmonic in the 60s was a bunch of fantastic musicians. Let's also agree that Von Karajan was a man of iron will, who knew what he wanted and how to get it. Let's agree that Deutsche Gramophone was probably the state of the art in recording in the period.But that's it. The 6th Symphony virtually everyone agrees is awful. Listen to Bruno Walter (with an inferior outfit -- the Columbia Symphony) and one quickly sees what is missing from this recording. In the 9th, the chorus is shrill, and the 3rd movement totally uninvolved -- pick up the Furtwangler for a totally awesome, hair-raising performance. The first and second lack Mozartian grace -- listen to Szell and Cleveland!The best of the set is the 5th -- all sturm and drang as it should be -- but even here, the Carlos Kleiber, also with the Berlin, is a superior recording.I expect this set will fade with time as an interesting period piece, but with no strong lasting value."
2,I didn't much like it!,"I am an enormous fan of Beethoven's music, and have been an avid collector of various recordings of his symphonies for many years.I'm not a professional musician, but am an eager amateur, and have been for much of my life. For me, Beethoven represents the peak of the art of the symphony. One of the other reviews suggested that Von Karajan's interpretation of Beethoven is an acquired taste. Well, it's one I don't particularly care for.Why? This is very subjective. Beethoven should be passionate. This recording loses much of that passion. This rendition is bland, syrupy, and (in my mind) played too fast.I much prefer the interpretations by Bruno Walter, Arturo Toscaninni, and especially George Szell."
3,Sound quality a little disappointing,"I never bothered to check the quality of classical music recordings until I bought this set. I'm used to listening to all DDD grade stuff, and this recording by Karajan is ADD. I'm sure some older listeners would rightly consider this set an improvement over a record or a cassette tape, and might even not notice any problem. But listeners acclimated to the more recent DDD recordings like me might be distracted. Because Beethoven's symphonic pieces fluctuate so much (volume-wise), I kept having to turn this ADD recording up because I couldn't hear, and then quickly turning it down again to avoid going deaf."
4,Worth Repeating: Best one volume bio of LBJ,"Given the complexity of both the man and the times he lived in I would have thought that a one volume biography of Lyndon Johnson was impossible. While certain sacrifices are made, for example the LBJ's relationships with his contemporaries are often glossed over, the book does its job and portrays the basics of who LBJ was. Dallek also does a good job at describing the master politician that LBJ was and how that helped him craft one of the most assertive and successful legislative agenda's in American history. Lastly, he explains how LBJ's obession with Vietnam ultimately lead to his downfall. A very interesting book and a strong must read for people interested in 20th century history."
5,Portait of a complex man,"During the 1960s, I was one of those who Johnson saw as aiding and abetting the enemy. I was strongly opposed to the Vietnam War and participated in demonstrations to try to bring an end to the war. I saw Johnson as a very one-issue president who was more concerned with ego and grandeur than peace and justice. Mr. Dallek's biography has helped me to flush out the man and his accomplishments. He truly brought civil rights to the political forefront and created programs that helped bring African American's out of abject poverty. He tried to bring New Deal sensibilities into the 1960s. Mr. Dallek's portrait is of a man of great ego who believed strongly in his causes. This resulted in both great accomplishments and failures. This biography helps flesh out a man who is only now, forty years later, being seen from for the complex individual that he is. This is a great and enlightening read."
3,"Interesting portrait, but clearly abridged","Interesting portrait, but clearly abridged. The book felt very rushed towards the end as if Dallek was rushing against a page count. I wish I would have read the two volume set."
4,Politcal Metamorphosis,"A sugar-coated political story. Spain was in the twilight of political tyranny. The science teacher, however well-educated and well-meaning he was, his torch of enlightenment was just too small. Oppressions and persecutions were still prevalent, life and human relationship even of the most intimate and innocent kind suffered... Fortunately, Spain soon turned herself into a butterfly as beautiful and as meaningful as the one the teacher showed his pupil who took part in his persecution by throwing stone at him...A heart-warming but also politically hair-raising story. Recommended."
5,Gardening in the Coastal South,"I was given 'Gardening in the Coastal South' as a gift. I had few expectations until I opened the book. Once opened, I could not put it down.I gardened in coastal Louisiana for 23 years. There I grew many of the plants that Marie Harrison discussed in her book. My recent move to Mississippi has opened a few new gardening doors, but I still relate to the stories told by Marie. I, too, am a hortimaniac, and I have particularly enjoyed her descriptions of this enviable condition.Not only have I enjoyed Marie's stories, but I have found her advice and gardening strategies down to earth and very practical. This book will always be at my fingertips when I shop for new plants for my new garden.I say, ""Thanks, Marie Harrison, for your delightful book."" I love it."
5,Something for Everyone,"This book is perfect for both the novice gardener and the experienced . . . even non-gardeners love it! Helpful information on choosing the correct plants for the coastal areas, along with descriptions of the appropriate plants and the author's personal experiences in gardening, make this a book you will turn to often.Ms Harrison's love of flowers and plants is contagious; you will want to make a quick trip to the garden store or nursery and then dig right in! Better still, she gives you the information you need to be successful. And best of all, the reading is entertaining as well as informative."
3,Brendel is better.,"Pollini's 13th Sonata just isn't quite right. The syncopation in the unique middle movement is sophomoric. I might get used to it, but I try to avoid it. Brendel's interpretation is better. Even Glenn Gould (not known as the go-to man for Beethoven) sounds more appropriate and much more interesting.The final movement of the 14th doesn't have the pace and power of Brendel either."
1,Republishing older books - a disappointing sales strategy,"Frankly, I think Nora Roberts must be raking in enough money for her popular novels without having to resort to the rather sneaky republishing strategies of books touted as ""new"" - and you buy them only to discover that - gee, golly, gosh - you've read them years ago and had expected something new! Waste of money and disappointment in this author whose novels usually offer a nice little get-away. I'll be more careful in the future of pre-ordering her ""new"" books! Sorry, Nora, you just went down a few notches on my scale! The one star is for just this -- not the novel itself which, if not among her best, is a pleasant distraction on a rainy day with nothing else to do."
3,This Magic Moment,"Although it was good, it lacked that oomphed factor that I expect from her books. Great if you like a light read before going to bed"
1,2 words,"this sux it doesnt look anything like orton. I have been watching wrestling since i was in kindergarden and hes never used a shovel. his vest sux, hes wearing lame ass pants, he looks like hes taking a dump, and i have 3 words 4 ya: THIS TOY SUX!!!!"
2,There is better out there,Had this product now over 1 year. Main part of desk is OK but still gets hot after an hour or so. Underneath is not very comfortable on your leg as there is no padding. The add-on Mouse extension is a joke. It locks on with just pressure clips and falls off constantly. It also is slick so unless flat the mouse will slide off.
1,Disappointing,"The picture shown for this book was not accurate with the book I received. I was expecting a different version and better condition. The book was very creased and has marks in it, which was not ""like new"" condition, as the description said."
1,"Read Zines, not this book",An outdated prescriptive tale that reduces the beauty of zines and the people who make them into a homogeneous group who are slaves to the culture of alternative-cool. Don't let anyone tell you that you are not cool/underground/nerd/loser enough to make zines. Zine makers are anyone.
3,A little know war in America.,"This a dated book. My dad found it at a thrift store. However, it does show the nature of organized crime in America up to 1974. In the last century, over 3,000 people were killed by organized crime. This exceeds those lost on 9/11 and Pearl Harbor. In effect, America has been at war with organized crime.There is a lot of serious writing in this book. Although there are plenty of pictures, there are 25 chapters of writing on the history of the Mafia. It tells of the formation of the Black Hand or Costra Nostra. It tells of the formation of the various gangs, their war with each other, and the killing of innocent people like the tipster who reported on the bank robber Willie Sutton. Most of those killed were other hoods, but many cops and innocents also lost their lives.This is an interesting although dated read on the Mafia. There is some good writing in here about the history of the Mafia."
4,A Four Star Book!,"I would recommend this book to any elementary history teacher for the classroom or any parent who has a child who says history is boring. This book brings you into the lives and feelings of the Lankford family during the turbulent times in Boston during the Stamp Act Riots. It focuses on Kathleen and her brother Will, who is an ardent Patriot. Kathleen, however is torn between following the Patriot cause and doing what is right, such as helping a wounded British soldier. The story shows how the violence of the time inflenced the actions of many innocent people and also shows that the issues of independance and liberty are not always black and white but have many shades of gray. A very good book, a must read for any child or adult interested in colonial times."
3,"LYRIC,VERY","Forgot about this chestnut until I heard this performance of the Lyric Suite on the radio. Mr. Jarvi's conducting was detailed, clear, sensative and down right beautiful. I've listened to many recordings of this work, some better than others. But this one has it all."
3,To be watched under influence!,"An interesting flick from the vast outpour of cheapies by the mastermind moviemaker Corman. If you love Corman for the 10 Poe adaptions he made between 1960 and 1965, you might be disappointed, because this one is quite far from the Gothic beauty he created later. A beatnik artist's society is quite well portrayed and the film is definitely worth a watch, but you might want to buy the Roger Corman retrospective, vol 1 instead - you'll get two more flicks and that's always good!"
3,A must for all Corman fans.,"This is a fairly predictable film, but still fun to watch. Dick Miller (long time Corman regular) gives a great performance as the demented artist who makes sculptures that are just a little too realistic. The cat in the wall scene is really a work of Corman magic!!!"
4,Kickin' Big Band Jazz!,"I mainly bought the CD because it contains a version of the *Tonight* show theme--but I fell in love with it because the whole thing is great. All the tracks are highly listenable, smooth, polished, and tight. But on ""King Porter Stomp,"" Doc and the guys really hit their stride and outclass even themselves. Their version has it all: cool jazz, hot licks, swingy rhythms, nifty riffs, Dixieland and Beebop tossed in here and there, and even some pretty neat musical punning. ""King Porter Stomp"" is my all-time favorite jazz/swing piece, so I know what I'm saying here...the CD is worth its price for this track alone. And, like I said, the rest ain't half bad either! If you like jazz with a cool swing that grabs your attention too, this one's for you."
1,Save your money,Doesn't work with iSync. Doesn't work with OSX Bluetooth File transfer. Sad.Hours wasted trying to make it work. Save your money.
1,SHIPMENT NOT RECIEVED,"We write to officially inform Amazon of the ordill we have been through since the purchase was made. Our item was to be shipped to DHL registered office: UNITED SHIPPING PARKAGING. 200 E 10TH ST. NEW YORK, NY 10003 UNITED STATES.

2,"NO, do not buy it !!!",It has terrible battery life. My cell phone last only 6 hours and I have to recharge it. I do not recommend this cell phone to anyone although it has nice graphic and easy-to-use programs. What could we do with short battery life?
4,Motorola A 1200,"This cell is perfect for me, but i wish i could add more languages... and I don't know how..."
5,Excellent Instructional DVD With Stories,"This is an excellent instructional dvd with stories about Mr. Jackson's life. For anyone but an advanced guitar player, the material that is slowed down and zoomed-in on is too difficult to pick up, save ""Louis Collins""; this particular tune can, indeed, serve as an introduction to Blues fingerpicking. Jackson messes up, leaves out or mumbles lyrics on many occasions, but this is acceptable due to his great stories about John Hurt, Skip James and Mance Lipscomb, whom he refers to as ""Nance Lister"". John comes across as a very cordial man who is capable of playing in the styles of Blind Blake, Blind Boy Fuller (though with a different type of guitar than Fuller played), and Josh White. I look forward to picking up the new Jackson dvd from guitarvideos.com, and recommend ""The Fingerpicking Blues of John Jackson"" to everyone."
1,"2 months, & still no product!","I ordered this Cutter spray on July 3rd, and it's now Sept 19th & I STILL haven't received it. I'd suggest not wasting your time, try another vendor or buy in a store!"
3,somewhat predictable,"Cuba Gooding and James Woods fans will enjoy their performances but this film is run of the mill. Once you've watched it, you'll realize that you've seen this plot and type of characters many times before. There's nothing unique about this film."
3,End Game - Synopsis and Review,"The Not-Too-Revealing-Synopsis:Secret Service investigation into an assassination. Conspiracy theories, hit men who is your ally and who is your friend.Review:The plot was interesting enough to want to know who did it. The acting was good, characters were above average. The bad guy coverup just seemed half-hearted and full of holes. The interplay between reporter and secret service agent was questionable and the ending is unsatisfying. If you watch it you can enjoy it, if you miss it there is no real loss."
3,James Riordan Gets Better,"In this latest Forbidden Doors book from James Riordan (yeah, he wrote it and not Bill Myers) Becka and Scott are off to save a rock star from getting in too deep with Satan. This is one of their tougher battles. It even includes an unexpected twist when one of the band members makes a play for the under-aged Becka.Unfortunately while this series is supposed to promote prayer and closeness to G-d, James Riordan keeps mucking it up with incorrect facts and bad writing.Once again there is no mention of the kids being away from school yet again. Somehow Scott gets hired as a roadie for the band even though he is only 14! The musicians actually run the special effects here and not technicians (no wonder there is trouble)."
5,Charming book to share!,"You'll laugh out loud at Ronnie's wry and sometimes ribald storytelling....and sure enough, you'll want to share this special collection of unique stories with a friend who'll appreciate it, too. A sweet treasure from a Southern Belle!"
1,Poor quality!!! problems with resolution and shadowy image,"I bought this 4 port kvm to hook up mi xbox mi desktop and mi laptop... since i have 2 port kvm same brand hooked up with my 22 inch monitor, the funny thing is the item is low quility it arrived with little scratch also the image with the 4 port kvm is blurry shadowy.. isnt clear with the 2 port kvm is not perfect but at least is clear and you dont notice also with the laptop it doesnt get all the full resolution... wich is weird because with the other kvm and also hooked up directly with lcd tv i have no problems with the resolution of the laptop... all i can say is buy at your own risk as i did but also im sure like me youll regret the buy... is pure garbage im sure out there is another one that works better...i would only recomend the buy if you are going to hook it up with something that doesnt require alot of resolution or a clean image"
5,Takes your breath away!,"Beautiful compositions and arrangements make this a memorable CD to which I will listen to many times. Freshness that touches your soul. The music is relaxing and with each playing there's something new to discover. Another CD that I highly recommend and some of the tunes on that CD may sound familiar as we hear them often as background music in stores, but we rarely ever find out who the artist is, is Dietmar Scherf's ""Nice To Meet Ya!"" CD--also available at Amazon."
3,Violins and more violins,"Not quite what I had expected. A CD of violin with violins and some piano and yet another violin. Which, for some maybe just what you want. It doesn't exactly transport me elsewhere like Inner Peace by Steve Halpern. It makes great background music for our office but otherwise, I haven't put it in my car to listen to while I travel."
2,These Songs Should Stay Secret,"If you LOVE Enya, you'll love this CD. For those of us who are sick of Enya, DON'T BUY THIS CD! I'm always disappointed in any artist who falls into the trap of creating formulaic music. Almost every song on this CD consists of virtually identical sounds that have been rearranged into a different song. Basically, every song is comprised of a whimsical piano melody overlaid with a violin. BORING! Yes, the music is relaxing, but so unimaginative as to render this CD to the realms of mediocrity. Stick with Loreena McKennitt for relaxing music, or I highly recommend Chris Spheeris' newest CD ""Dancing with the Muse."" Now some irony. I bought ""Songs From A Secret Garden"" because of a review I read on this Web site, so take everything I (or anybody else) writes with a healthy dose of skepticism. Enjoy!"
3,Expected More,"Overall I could have made a less desirable purchase I guess, but the CD was less than what I expected. After hearing two tracks from the CD on the radio, I expected the entire CD to be similar.....it wasn't. If waffling between this CD and another choice, I'd recommend the other choice."
4,Happy but not great,"I'm pleased with this album overall. I purchased this album for use in my massage therapy business and was disappointed that several of the songs have ""jarring"" moments. I have to skip them which creates more work for me."
3,Not what I expected,"I may have made a mmistake, but based on the photo I expected a CD, but got a tape...and have nothing to play it on................oh well............hope it wasn't my fault as I do business here constantlyDiane"
3,It was ok,It seemed like some of the heros were invincible (the newly highly trained Genyoshi couldn't do a thing). But I like the interaction of the characters...except for with Justin Xiang (Allard) and that woman on solaris and Grey Noton.
3,"Chilton's Nissan Stanza, etc","We bought this book because we wanted a teardown manual. This book does not have the specs needed to repair a fuel injector and other things. Very disappointed. Wish Haynes had a teardown book for my 1992 Nissan Stanza, but they don't. We will now have to buy the service manual from the Nissan dealer, which they say is $75. Might as well forego this book and buy from the dealer and save your money."
1,Very poor book.,"I bought this book as a cheap alternative to the factory service manual. I tried to find a Haynes manual, but they don't seem to have one for a 240SX. This manual is pretty useless. It tries to cover too many models and too many years, and just ends up leaving out most of the information that you will need. The only wiring diagrams are for the lights and ignition system. I am trying to install a stereo and fix my power door locks, but there are no diagrams..."
1,don't do it!,"Hold out for the offical Nissan Service Manual. I bought this for my 1990 240SX, but this book is worthless. It trys to cover to many different models (Stanza, 200SX, 240SX) and years (10!) that it does not give any specific detail to any particular vehicle. It really is not worth your time."
4,Great tool for anyone,This guide offers great detail of just anything you'd want to do. I own a 240sx and some things were missed in the book it is otherwise a great tool that I check before anything I do.
2,pictures from a wandering life,"this is storie from a time as a wanderer. some of it is a interesting read, some of it not. all in all it's like images, and the reader doesn't get too involved. L has never been famous for writing from a biographical point of view, and it's not surprising. i was charmed by some of the scenes, but on the whole it was not such an interesting read"
1,worst target controls ever,"this has to be the worst third person shooter on the ps2.the graphics are horrible for what the ps2 could produce, and the controls(ie aim/targeting) are the worst ever, sloppy jerky targeting. no matter how youadjust the sensitivty settings in the options menu the analog targeting sucks.its frustrating at best to try and aim and hit your target, i can only hope for amouse/keyboard smart joy frag adapter to fix this. or buy the pc version with truemouse/keyboard control for accurate aiming control.the developers of this game failed to deliver proper analog thumbstick targeting control, like socom us navy seals did.the only thing this game is good for is the blood and gore."
1,Avoid Kindle version,"I've been a fan of the printed Lonely Planet guidebooks, but the format does not survive to Kindle. Legends are pages away from Maps, and it is very difficult to flip between reviews and maps or any other ""random access"". The ""GOTO"" feature doesn't really get you where you want to be, and Kindle bookmarks are not sufficiently accessible or intuitive. I love my Kindle, but get the print version if you want the Lonely Planet. I hoped the portability would be improved, but I ended up find the guidebook all but useless."
3,good but not quite as good as I was expecting,"Overall, Lonely Planet is my favorite series of travel guides. In many ways, the Peru 2000 edition is excellent. It covers a lot of secondary tourist destinations, and its maps are definitely better than what you find in other guidebooks. But, and this is a big but, there isn't much difference between this version and the previous one. I expect a new edition to cover new territory but this one is basically a repeat of the previous one; the only notable difference is that the author has added a bunch of e-mail addresses for hotels."
1,"Excellent guide, but ...","I have used several Lonely Planet guidebooks in the past and I have found them all to be very useful. Unfortunately, my copy of this book (5th edition) came missing pages 101-108 - the section dealing with Nazca. The rest of the book is good, but how can a publisher let an error like this make it onto the bookshelf or into Amazon's warehouse?"
5,An amazing book! Used every page of it!,I never used a book while traveling abroad as much as I used this one! Excellent purchase! I highly recommend it!
5,Still the best guide to go with,"We travelled peru with a tour company in the fall and although we were not backpacking as such the lonely planet guide became an invaluable piece of info. The Cusco and Lima guides in particular were very good and if it was not for Lonely planet we would not have found the Papa Pacha restaurant in Cusco which was the best we had ever been to - food cooked in a real Pachamanca!!I have always used Lonely planet guides, most recently for thailand, china and Peru and they have always come up trumps!! Like another reviewer said - I only ever pack one.There is one thing though that I never been too keen on especially in the Peru country one, is that the accommodation they recommend is not the best options but everything else is wonderfully constructed :) Thanks Lonely Planet!!"
2,The New Lonely Planet leaves out the shoestring travellers,"I am so dissapointed that the Lonely Planet Guides are changing their format and leaving out the budget traveller. This was evident in the Peru guide, the first of these new Lonely Planets I have used. The voice has really changed, and many of the suggested sites and so forth no longer speak to travellers on a small budget or travellers wanting to get off the beaten path. The clarity of the guide remained intact. The maps were great, and many of the essential details I found deficient in the Rough Guide were included in the Lonely Planet. But without the Rough Guide, I would have missed many of the great experiences I had in Peru."
4,indispensable,"I lugged this book all over Peru and then highlighted and flagged the most helpful parts for my father and insisted he take it when he visited a few years later.It gives a great overviews of Peru's history and politics, helpful tips about traveling, tipping, changing money, security, a menu decoder for indigenous foods, and of course, capsules of information about sites to see, places to stay."
3,Idaho Map,"Overall a nice map book, but I needed a detailed street map, so I am disappointed; it has been somewhat helpful, I just need a lot more street detail. Idaho is changing fast though; a detailed map today would be outdated tomorrow."
3,A sad legal twist,"Cape May Courthouse: A Death in the Night. Cape. Until a minor traffic accident in a snowstorm one evening in Cape May Courthouse, New Jersey, not many people had ever heard of Tracy and Eric Thomas. Lawrence Schiller recounts this tragedy in light of legal twists that tossed Eric Thomas into a wrongful death action at the helm of media frenzy. While Cape May Courthouse does a good job detailing the nuts and bolts of the legal proceedings, it is, at times, dense with legal jargon. If you are though, as I am, a fan of All Things Legal, you may enjoy this true crime book."
5,too bad they stopped making it,"A great fragrance I have worn for years. Unfortunately, like all good things, it too must pass. They have stopped manufacturing it. Hence, the ridiculous prices."
5,Dope Speakers for small cost!!!,"The Macally Ice Tune(speaker IPOD Docking station) ROCKS!!! Especially with the economy the way it is right now!!!! Great Price! Great Sound! I would recommend it to a friend...Of course if I had the money to buy a quality system, I would've got something bigger. :)"
3,"Complex, fast moving topic","I bought this book as soon as it came out, and I was reading the docs online more than the book.What I was really hoping for from the book was how to setup some of the more complex postfix installations, at the time anyway, that the book was supposed to cover. It turned out the book did a poor job explaining what I was trying to do, and I was back to reading forums to get my answers.The online docs are a much better source of information then the book."
4,mail server made easy,"This book is very good at explaining the philosophy of Postfix and its operating principles. Even though the book was written for Postfix 2.1, these principles are still relevant. I was able to setup and small email server ( < 100 users) using Postfix 2.7 based largely on the information from the book, supplemented with the documentation included with the port I was using and the web site ([...]). I recommend using all three sources but start with the book so that you understand the nature of the beast."
3,"Good book, unfortunately not the best in the field...","I've got all three books in the field, and this is a good book. Unfortunately, although Kyle's book was co-written by the author of the software, I believe that ""The Book of Postfix: State-of-the-Art Message Transport"" by Ralf Hildebrandt is a better choice."
5,These monitors sound great!,"I was apprehensive because of my worries about the bass - especially since I needed to mount them rather high up so I would lose additional bass response. But these things sound great. Bass is totally there (I turn up the bass on my receiver a bit) - and the sound is clean and crisp. I use them for my living room entertainment center, including CD, LP, TV, ipod, etc. They were easy to mount, and they look great too. I'm very happy with these speakers."
3,"Great story, bad writing","I bought this book because I absolutely loved the movie and wanted to re-live it before it was out on video. Well, I still think it's the best story ever--very uplifting and optimistic--but this book is poorly written. I suppose I didn't expect it to be particularly good writing, but it really did take away from the wonderful message of the book. I would not recommend buying this book unless you see the movie first."
3,Good Company but Candles didn't work so well,This is my favorite company for ear candles but the candles stopped smoking after a few minutes so none of the smokey goodness was getting into the ear canal. I was not happy about this.
1,Worthless,"This product is worthless. It even says in the directions ""for entertainment purposes only."" It does absolutely nothing, and I would not recommend it to anyone. Total waste of money!"
2,Waste of money!,Didn't get pasted the 1st chapter. Thought the hero should be convicted of grand stupidity. Not up to Turow's usual creativity.
1,Watch the movie and forget the book,Seldom are films better than books. PI is one of them. Don't bother reading it if you've seen the film.
5,I've not been so inspired to write 'til I read his prose.,"Normally, books are a means of escape or an exercise in fueling my mind. However, this gem, although it is a decade old, still affects me as no other book has since. The prose is fascinating and rythmic. It inspired me to aspire to be my husband's Eve and to make a way for my Adam to come home."
5,Great weekend read.,"This is one of those great mystery stories that seems to hint at a solution all along, but noticing the subleties dropped points to the real conclusion where a real charactore did the crime. I read the book and bought the movie within hours of finishing it. Good stuff."
4,Great legal thriller/mystery,"Scott Turow weaves a complex and suspenseful legal drama and murder mystery, and then bashes you over the head with an eerie ending.If you think you like Grisham, then do yourself a favor and read an author who can actually write.Read this book."
4,Turow hits like a hammer,"Well, I have to say that after Turow's first book, it won't be my last! Man, he blows us away with action, and some top notch suspense that is pracitically haunting at times. Sometimes we might see that the story is about a dead lawyer, but Turow pretty much brings it alive for the most part.Telling this in the first person isn't the easiest thing to do, and it wasn't always easy to follow. But once you get past that, it is an enjoyable read. It might even be safe to say that this is a fatally attractive in some ways! I think that Carolyn Polhemus proves that with a few people, eh?So, what does this prove? That there are others out there other than Grisham that can write this stuff? Nah! But Scott Turow is different, and a read that is to be looked forward to in the future!"
1,Racist Portrayal of Minorities,"The book was long, boring and not a very good thriller. Most of the minorities from the secretary to the pathologist were negatively portrayed and spoke as if they never learned standard English. All of the black women were described as fat. I could go on, but I dare not waste anymore time on Turow. This is my first and last."
5,No presumption needed - it remains the best of the genre.,"Presumed Innocent remains the preeminent legal thriller (my second reading). Plot and characterizations are superb, especially rewarding is that Turow has provided plausible motivations for his characters' actions. He wraps up it all up with a gut-wrenching ending."
5,Cults in our Mists,"Cults in Our Midst: The Continuing Fight Against Their Hidden MenaceThis book is so good. It explainms what cults are, how they operate, why they operate in the way that they do and the characteristics of cult leaders. It explains that anyone can become involved in a cult regardless of sex, class, wealth or education. It talks about the great harm that they do and how to recover from a cult. I highly recommend."
5,Excellent resource-- should be a must-read for parents launching their children into adulthood,"This book is very thorough and describes characteristics of cult leaders, recruitment and retention methods, impact of cult membership on individuals and families, departure from cults, and more. Parents are quick to discuss the dangers of promiscuity, drugs, and alcohol before their children go off to college, but predatory religious organizations and cults are equally dangerous. The information in Singer's book gives the reader the tools to differentiate between a healthy organization and a toxic, cult-like group. It is important for young people to read this while their minds are free and their critical-thinking skills are fine-tuned. Due to the nature of cults, it is difficult for cult-members to realize the are in a cult and take appropriate action to leave."
3,"This product was ""okay.""","I think that these bar stools are very nice looking and easy to put together. I found that when it comes to practical use, the seat is really too small to sit on for any length of time. Additionally, I found that they were really too tall for my kitchen countertops. I am going to have to cut the legs a few inches so that they will be comfortable to sit on while at the counter."
3,"right chair for the price, cheap.","i bought four chairs, one had slight damage from shipping. chairs were slow to arrive. they were neither leather nor oak. but the color was a match. i've looked around and feel i paid the right price for the chair. they seem sturdy enough and work fine."
5,So far so good,Bought two of them. Great value for the price. Only used for workouts it's great so far. I'll follow up after a few months of use.
3,Wrong template guide for my router,"I purchased one of these template sets for possible future use but found that the included template guide doesn't fit my Skil 1810 router. The correct parts (SKIL 91905 Router Guide Bushing Set (4 pc)andSkil RAS140 Template Guide Adaptor) are available on the Amazon site but I'll probably delay buying them for now.To the reviewer who complained that it's nearly impossible to lower the spinning router bit through the templates without destroying them, I say READ THE DIRECTIONS. You're supposed to lower the router guide through the template BEFORE you turn it on."
3,OK,"Though this release isnt as strong as the second cd, 702 manages to get some good tracks out the so-so material they were working with. big name producers like Mario Winans, THE NEPTUNES, AND KEVIN ""SHE'KSPERE"" BRIGGS could have taken a little more time with the tracks. towards the end of the cd.....you practically find yourself throwing it out. but not before you enjoy the good stuff. the neptunes ""I STILL LOVE YOU"" is the clear standout. it bangs from beginning to end. ""TROUBLES"", ""REALITY"", ""CERTIFIED"" are also standouts.But the hits come to far in between on this lp. The lack of promotion didnt help this release any either."
5,The Distilled Power Of Thinking And Growing Rich...,"Sure, this is a wonderful starter kit (yes, I do have this book...) in addition to Hill's other books like ""Think and Grow Rich"", ""The Master Key To Riches"", et al. But more than that, it is a primer that makes you hungry for the mental nourishment of his full ""Law Of Success"" which I have just ordered through Amazon. And why am I giving this distillation five stars? C'mon, isn't it obvious, through these *distilled* principles you get a pretty good taste of the ""spirit-voice"" of Napoleon Hill. And when he says in later versions of ""Think and Grow Rich"" - 'through these pages we have met'. You know what he means here, even though it is shortened and edited. So, I've said enough, get started, happy reading.Captain Josh/Joshua Clayton"
5,great songs,i play haunted house every halloween for my grankids. they love it. i think this is the only hit he ever had.
4,Just got it,"The box that came with this item looked crumpled but the straps were okay. I have to put it on the boat to see if this really works. Reading the illustrated instructions, seems easy to put on. I made a PVC support system for my boat using bungee cords to hold it in place and it does prevent water from pooling on top of the cover. The maintenance, installation and De-installation of the PVC support system is time consuming for me. Will try this support system.Addition to above review: Easy to put on. I placed the supporting pole more forward than my homemade PVC support pole. The slope on the cover is better front and back. It rained today not hard. The test will come when there is a hard Florida downpour which happens often."
2,QAF 6600 is not ideal,"although TTL function may work with most cameras. the IR assist for focusing does not work with all AF cameras. for example, i have the Nikon version, and the AF assist does not work with Nikon N80 camera. make sure to check before you purchase."
4,Excellent for Beginners,"This book really teaches the novice C programmer pointers. It sparked my interest in pointers and has helped me to understand pointers. I use this book for reference all the time. If you want to get a good understanding of pointers, this is a good book to read. I am learning C++, and I still use this C book as a reference to refresh my memory with some fundamental concepts. It is very easy to read too. Perfect for the beginner. I docked off a star because the writer uses turbo c and MS DOS; it's kind of an old-school book. Nonetheless, Traister explains the concepts very well, which is all I need from it."
2,not impressed,This book has little practical examples and too much mathematics. I'd recommend it for educational purposes only.
4,OC and stigs,We got our movie even faster than we thought we would!!!! We have looked and looked for this movie. It's one of hubby's favorite movies :-)
4,Informative View of NYC Mob,"Author John Davis takes a historical look at New York's Gambino crime family from its earlier days of Charles ""Lucky"" Luciano and Albert Anastasia, to the Carlo Gambino, Paul Castellano, and John Gotti era's that followed. I liked the author's personal look at each of these Godfathers, plus his analysis of their strengths and weaknesses. Readers see how the mob derives its income from payoffs in construction, trucking, and garment-making, plus stand-bys like gambling, extortion, pornography and loan sharking. The author also examines the rise and decline of New York City's five families, of which the Gambino's were the most powerful. Not surprisingly, the book focuses more heavily on recent years, particularly the reign of the ""Teflon Don"" John Gotti (1940-2002) from his takeover in late 1985 until his conviction and life sentence in 1992. Overall, this is a readable and interesting look at the mob/mafia hold on New York City."
5,One of the best LCN books in a long time,"I must say that I enjoyed every page of this book, and I think that the author Davis have been very successful in his writing. Not only he knows a lot about the topic, have done a serious research, he have also been able to write in a easy way that makes the story even more interesting, and easy to follow. Another thing is that he have a distance to what he is writing, and he have been able to look at the issue without bias - he neither glorifies or are to judging - and he discuss different persons, events, etc, with a proper distance.Finally, I would recommend this book to anyone that are interested in OC and LCN, especially to those who do not have read to much about the subject before. A real OC buff might think that this book are a little bit to broad for serious research, but I think that they will enjoy the story anyway!Regards,/Alex"
2,i'll take a pass,"lacks depth and detail in a lot of areas. It should have provided more on the early days of the Gambino family in regards to such bosses as Mangano, Anastasia and especially Gambino. The book deals largely with Castellano and to a greater extent Gotti, which have both been covered much better in other books. essentially this is just a re-hash of many of those books. A lot of the book is built on unconfirmed legend as opposed to documented facts as well. save your money on this one."
3,More Carlo & Albert; less Johnny Boy,"This review is of a rather dated mob book but I just reread it and may as well add my two cents.As with older reviewers,I agree it's mostly a Gotti book.Too bad,as I would have liked reading more about Gambino and Anastasia.But I guess it's tough to find more detailed info,as you'd have to go back to the 40s,50s,and 60s.Not as many rats back then.Not bad,but read Raabs ""Five Families"" or Capeci & Mustain's or Volkmanns Gotti books."
1,Not that impressed........,"I would not order it again. However, I will say that it's the only product I could use following acid peels. Everything else would burn."
2,??,Was it just me or did anyone notice that Stone Barrington's new plane ID number was the same ID number used by JOHN the bad guy? Are they the same person?
3,The Day after yesterday: that's Today!,"The only reason i Amazoned this title was because thisshares the name of the fictional novel in the movie ""Sideways.""The title is kinda goofy."
2,confused,"I find this record disappointing and, considering the final results, not a little pretentious. You get the usual spiritual name checking in the ""influences"" section (the Tibetan Book of the Dead(!), The Egyptian Book of the Dead, African spirituality, etc. etc) but there isn't much in the music to show where all those influences went.There ARE memorable moments, dont' get me wrong and hence the 2 stars. But there just aren't enough of them to really make a difference.Moods tend to clash against each other preventing the album from really setting an atmosphere or developing, and the music goes from the rather beautiful ""Healing Song"" to the plodding. pedestrian RB of ""Children Hold On"". The whole thing feels like a jumbled collection of individual pieces rather than a coherent album.Get an Alice Coltrane record instead. It'll probably be everything this record tries (and fails) to be."
1,Very Unreliable Product,"This product seemed like the ideal solution for my six year old's problems. It would be, if it were at all reliable. Unfortunately, it only works maybe 30 percent of the time. Most nights, my son wakes in the morning in a puddle having worn the stupid things all night with the alarm not going off at all. My husband messed with them trying to get them to work and says the wiring sewn in the undies is really crummy. You have to fiddle with the wiring to get them to work. How do you do that every night?"
5,PHENOMENAL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"THIS IS HANDS DOWN THE BEST HEAVY METAL/SPEED METAL ALBUM RECORDED IN THE LAST 10 YEARS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! IF YOU PASS THIS ONE BY, YOU ARE MISSING A VERY IMPORTANT LESSON AND EXPERIENCE IN LIFE AND METAL!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Extremely Disappointing,"I am a Sepultura fan, and I like ""Chaos A.D."" and ""Roots"" the best (the early stuff rules as well), but when Max Cavalera left the band in 1996 and Derrick Green took over for vocals, the CD's have been extremely disappointing. ""Against"" is the one I like the best, but I couldn't get into ""Nation"" or ""Roorback"".I purchased this about a year ago, as I wanted to listen to some newer Sepultura and this album wasn't available on Napster. I was really disappointed. ""Come Back Alive"" is a decent opener, but it tends to trail on like this on most of the tracks. ""Mind War"" was a decent track, but it never caught my attention. However, I liked the U2 cover of ""Bullet The Blue Sky"", even though I hate U2 with a passion. But the outcome is that it is easy to forget this CD. If you must buy it, buy it used, like bloodlust 69 recommended. Just be glad that this isn't as disappointing as (*cough* St. *cough* Anguish *cough*)."
2,Not Much Architecture,"If you're interested in Mr. Hellman's politically correct judgments on civilizations throughout time, with occassional comments on their architecture, this is the book for you. You might want to have a book on architecture handy to explain terms he uses, but doesn't explain, such as flying butress and ribbed vault."
3,disappointed,"The pieces are poorly finished, resulting in problems for connecting one piece to another. This is especially frustrating for young children. The plastic elbows/joints don't hold because some of the wooden pieces are too thin and some too thick. So it's hardly worth the money."
3,Hyper Music = Snakecharmer,"""My personal favourite is Hyper Music as the guitar riff is so spectacular, you would see any axe player drool over bellamy's effortless talents.""Yeah, it is a great riff. It's just a pity Bellamy pretty much copied Rage Against the Machine's ""Snakecharmer"" from the album ""Evil Empire"" for it. They did add a nice bassline to the verse, though."
3,It's good...,But this is what Muse needs to learn next to take their music to a new level...They need to try singing a different style on at least one of their tracks.
2,OK if you like beethovenish interpretations.,"Overall, it is all right, except the tempo lags here and there (notably the Sym. 5). Personally, my favorite one here is the Sym. 3, especially the 3rd mvt. The choice of chorus in the Sym. 2 is indeed a poor one. Particularly, the sopranos pretty much screamed themselves out, one of the worst performances I've ever heard. Edith Mathis isn't that effective, either."
1,These cameras are defective within 1-2 years,"I had the Nikon Coolpix S3 for about 14 months (of course the warranty ended after 12), and the screen went black all of a sudden. You can still view old pictures, but all new pictures come out completely black. This is apparently a VERY common problem with Nikons, particularly this model. They have a service advisory for several other Coolpix models to fix this same problem, but not for the S3-S6 models - and Nikon will charge you a significant amount of money to fix it. DO NOT get suckered into buying this camera, or any Nikon for that matter - I was extrememly disappointed with the camera, but especially with their service."
4,Nice,"I love the camera, but you may want to know that Nikon has dicontinued this item. It's been really hard to find replacement parts."
3,Boring,After Supernatural this is boring. It amounts to 15 instumental jam sessions without the usual Santana emotion.
4,Good WWII book,"This is a good book for anyone interested in WWII history. His speeches give Great Britain's point of view durning WWII, even before the war begins. America is mentioned several times in the book, but does this book does not give a very detailed description of what is going on in America durning this time. The book focuses on the war in Europe and Africa only. Japan is rarely mentioned. Overall this is a good book, comprised of Churchill's speeches."
1,20g Ipod,Completly stopped working after only being in my possession for less than a month. A disappointing waste of money.
1,BEWARE!!!,"Do not go on the website suggested by Hooked on Gadgets, it is a spam sending and fishing/phishing site that will try to steal your identity and send you LOADS of junk mail."
3,Wow... What Idiots...,"Well, this is my idea. Since we don't have a box set price yet, lets assume it's $150 regualar.Black/Red U2 Special Edition iPod + $350U2 Box Set + $150$50 Off Box Set With iPod Purchase - $50-----------------------------------------$450 for iPod and Box SetNormal iPod (20 GB) + $300U2 Box Set + $150-----------------------------------------$450 for iPod and Box SetYou aren't saving any money, so if you're just getting it for the color and you don't really care about U2, DON'T GET IT! $50 extra is a little too much to spend for a gift certificate you aren't going to use.Otherwise, the iPod is fine! Sure, you only get 18.2 GB of space when you get it, but you can fit over 6000 songs on it!"
2,Extra $ for some bling bling?,Don't think the hype is worth the extra cost above the normal white ones.Yeah it comes with the songs and all but most U2 fans will either already have them or will steal them off of the internet anyway.
3,Assumes too much from the readers,"This book consists in brief review of the fourier transform and a few applications.The brief review in the first two chapters is ok Only the essentials are given and the proofs are omitted.The problem starsts with the applications. There are applications to difraction of light to information theory and so on. However too much is assumed from the students with respect to those applications .After reading the chapters the students , i suspect, will ask what they have learned.A little more material explaining what the applications are about would improve the book a lot.It is almost useless in the present form"
1,Too Expensive- Not enough Features!,"I've owned the ipod photo for a month now, and i realized that this unit is too expensive for its features. The only thing this Ipod can do is for viewing photos and listening to music. I am now looking onto the Archos Gmini 400, which has memory card reader, photo, video, music, and gameplay all in one for a little over half the price of this ipod. This Ipod Photo is way too expensive for the petty features. Get the Archos Gmini 400 instead."
4,-Not Bad,"If your wondering what Maiden's first singer was like. That would be Paul Di'anno. Di'anno is a rough edge singer and I think he sounds great, well alot better than Blaze anyways. Overall I thought that this particular album wasn't bad. It's got alot of good tunes in it and overall it's pretty decent. If you like Paul Di'anno than you'll like this cd."
2,Terrible Siegfried,What renders this set totally uncompetitive is the poor singing in the title role. It's a huge disappointment! Behrens provides some silvery singing in the final half hour but she's over-taxed by some passages. The performance by the other singers are ordinary. The performance of Levine's and the MET orchestra is not as good as in the other operas in the tetrology.
3,Of some interest perhaps,"I'm afraid Ms. Ozick is unable to empathize with the tremendous challenges facing feminists today. Her inability to present the true sufferings of women, as they challenge white male patriarchy, rape, lies, and indifference, as well as her absolute refusal to demonstrate the incredible richness and variety of mother/daughter relationships, is extremely frustrating. When I want to read a REAL writer of courage and feminist conviction, I turn to bell hooks, Katha Pollitt, Adrienne Rich, and other empathetic, brave and brilliant voices. I do not turn to a mildly talented conservative 'story-teller' like Ozick."
3,THIS F.I.S.T. LACKS ROCKY'S PUNCH!,"It's hard to believe I never watched this movie before recently. I had caught a few minutes of it here and there on TV over the years but, never bothered to watch it through. For the most part the story itself is compelling enough but, the characters seem one dimensional and after a good first half the characters, not the story make the film drag. It's a shame because the film's not bad but, it's pretty forgettable. Like the movie 'Hoffa' which this film is obviously emulating it has an unsatisfying ending, this one being way too abrupt! I had invested 2 1/2 hours in this mediocre film and it just ended badly! It's OK as I did enjoy the film but, I doubt I will ever watch it again."
3,"Yes, there was a time that Sly could act!","This is a really good movie with credible acting and drama. Always was. Hard to believe the writer eventually went on to write SHOWGIRLS!One correction: To ""rjclaster"", Stallones's character name is JOHNNY Kovak, not Frank.One question: To ""cjs1989"", are you seriously telling us that you're the son of director Norman Jewison? If you're for real, I'm sorry, but F.I.S.T. was not his best film. For my money, it will always be AND JUSTICE FOR ALL!"
1,F.I.S.T.,Stallone at his very worst. A one dimensional look at an average man with high ideals being corrupted by the things he used to hate as he rises in power. Avoid this film like the plague.
1,the worst stallone movie yet,"My title says it all.this is the worst stallone movie yet.i just watched the begginning and then skiped to the end.i eally didnt understand the plot of it.skip it,please.save yourself presious time and get ""Over The Top"" instead."
2,Follow Focus Broke on first shoot....rig is nice,"I purchased this rig with Follow Focus to do some small films , The rig feels nice enough , Although on the very first shoot I did with this product the Follow Focus main gear fell off..I could push it back in place , it just kept falling out during the shoot...that I am not happy about....I needed the rig and could not afford the down time.The seller did say I could return it for a new one or a refund , although I had jobs planned and could not take the time to wait days and days to get the return sent and wait for a new one to show up...I had to glue the gear back in place , seems to work ok now just wish I didnt have to do that to a brand new item...I would have sent it back for full refund if I had time too...All in all , Rig feels decent , When working Follow Focus is decent as well...when working properly."
2,Disk doesn't play,Got this thing from Walmart unfortunately. They'd just screwed me on a Magnavox DVD player which broke down after 93 days - they cover it for 90 days. So stupidly I bought this Sony SLV-D370P thinking that perhaps a better brand name would mean a better product. It is a good product. Everything works really nice except it won't play DVD disks and kicks out an error code. I can't find the error code mentioned on the Net. But now I'm stuck with another incompetent Walmart item backed up by their underpaid workers who really don't care. So watch your back if you buy one of these things!
4,Very good product.,"I really like this machine. Being low-tech, I had to rent a DVD to see how it worked. Splendidly. I have had this machine for almost two months and the only problem I had was with Sony's tech support. Evidently they are in India or some foreign place. The problem was I couldn't get the ""Search"" to work. Neither could they. One hung up and the other said to press the search button, then quickly switch to the channel I actually wanted to search. Didn't make sense to me either. Finally figured it out."
4,got it last week in JAN.,So far the dvd/vcr is good. I replaced my vcr that I had for 15 years and my dvd that I had about 5 years. I use my vcr ALOT to record tv shows because I'm never home at night. And based on every body reviews I picked this one. One of the things I don't like is that you can't put in the channel numbers. you have to use the up and down buttons to change the channels. 2nd the remote buttons are small and there are alot of them so that it may be a problem for the techno-illiterate. But I like it so far.
2,DVD player stops in middle of disc,The DVD player will stop or show different horizontal tracks after playing for about an hour. Can increase duration of playing by putting ice packs on top of metal frame by air holes. Give it a 2 star rating because the vhs player works well. Would not recommend this for purchase.
2,You Let Me Know,"I just didn't get this one. I needed a lot more to go on. The characters were all over the place. I needed more of an explanation, other than the obvious, for all the rage. Good cast, though."
4,Good and Heartfelt Read!,"Marcus Grodi has done a good job with his first novel. I enjoyed most learning about the stresses and tensions undergone by the typical Protestant pastor, his wife, and children. That part of the story is explained very well that the expectations demanded of the pastor's wife and children are high often causing unbearable tension in the family.The plotline is also good, and the reader's attention is held until the satisfying climax.My interest waned a bit when the story took a more theological turn, and the discussions about scripture and church history deepened.Stephen LaPointe had only a love of Christ and a desire to preach the Gospel. He found out that life is not that simple. His search for the truth led him to Catholicism. It was not an easy journey."
2,Why are all of saints light-skinned?,"This book is a lovely book. I think that the hymn that the text is based upon is especially fun for children in looking at saints in the past and the saints who are presently around us. However, I was very disheartened to see that the saints are all depicted as people with light skin. There are two people of color depicted, but one has to really look hard to find them in the crowd. Obviously, there is something wrong if we think that only light-skinned people are saints."
3,this book wasn't very useful,I think the book had too much talk about complicated things and the illustrations were terrible.
2,Good concept. Very inconsistent motion detection.,"The game is rich in concept. However, in our experience, portions of the game are essentially unplayable because of severe inconsistencies with motion detection during short game and especially putting. Consequently, it's impossible learn the right way to do some things because the exact same motion will be interpreted differently (or won't be interpreted at all) by the system each time you do it. Our Wii works great with Wii Sports and Wii Play. No problems with the remote(s) with those games. So our conclusion is that the experience is subpar (but not under par) with Tiger Woods 07 for the Wii."
1,Controls are Broken.,"The controls of this game are broken.When you start to swing and take the Wiimote back, even just a few inches, your game character already does a full backswing.Sometimes the game character swings on it's own, specially when putting.I'm sticking to Wii Sports Golf."
5,Slide Sorter Lightbox,Sorter is great for sorting your slides. Helps you to get everything organized if you want to get everything in order of how you took your pictures.
5,Perfect for viewing slides,"This is a great simple product. If you have a million slides that you want to see what they look like and are thinking of scanning them or making prints of them, this is the most practical 1st step. Easy assembly - easy viewing. The perfect slide viewer."
4,Great for quick slide reference,"Have to supply your own light bulb. The plastic display was marred, but does not appear to affect the viewing of slides. Like the way it folds for storage"
3,Lacking design quality,"I bought this sorter to review a large number of slides. My choice was poor, I did not realise that the image size would be inadequate to determine the clarity (and sometimes content) of my slides. I ended up buying a Panavue Automatic Sorter which is easier to load and gives a large clear image. This one may be best if you only want to consider the order in which you arrange the slides.The sorter itself is difficult to use because the sorting surface does not fit well on the frame and periodically ""pops off"" scattering the slides. I fixed mine by taping the surface to the frame. Considering the quality, this item is over priced."
5,Helpful Tool,We are very happy with our recent purchase of the slide viewer/sorter box. It arrive quickly and was in excellent condition. It will be a life-saving tool for sorting through our thousands of slides!
1,Not one of Karajan's high points,"Few conductors are actually fully comfortable in all areas of the classical repertoire and Karajan despite his prolific recording career is no exception. The sound of the orchestra is essentially the same as in all Karajan/Berlin recordings of German repertoire. What Karajan fails to realize is that Berlioz requires a completely different approach, not least because of his unique orchestration and its demands on orchestral color, phrasing and ensemble playing. The BPO have proven themselves more than capable of mesmerizing performances of French repertoire under other conductors. But this recording is disappointing not only because of Karajan's failure to connect with the score, but also because of an unusual (for the BPO) amount of imprecise and messy ensemble playing and bad balancing."
4,A good primer,"This book offers a solid primer on the Riot Grrrl Movement. I actually keep it on reserve for my college aged students to use. While the book is written for a younger audience, my students enjoy the book."
2,"great sound, but not loud at all","One of the reviewers stated he was a collector of headphones.and reviewed these as comparable to ""beats"" by Dr. Dre.Maybe thats true, that doesn`t say much for ""beats""everything is great, but the volume.with the volume all the way up, it sounds like its about 1/2 way or something, do I need some kind of inline amp... ?be sure to get a decent 1/4 to 1/8 adaptor, and check reviews. your dead in the water without that adaptor (if your listening to a portable mp3 player)they are also hot. Inside the climate controlled room of your choice, your ears will be sweating within 20 to 30 min."
2,Not what I thought.,"I was disappointed with this game. Through the years I have had quite a few games of this type and I am really surprised that""Bicycle"" would put their name on this unit.I certainly would not recommend it to anyone."
1,Never,Selling this old piece of junk for 500 bucks in unfair. This pc would sell for 200$ or less on ebay(only if anyone needs an antique).I dont understand the list price of 2200 as well!!!!.
2,Good Words But Not Practical,"Easy reading, mostly well written and a good book for a basic class or self study on differentiation but like most educational publications today, idealistic and not really practical. It is the same canned information about how we are supposed to differentiate 28 kids in a class, be sensitive and understand every single and background, be able to read kids' minds, and of course, have students lead the class. We discuss it in class, smile and nod at how great the ideas are and then go back to the reality of our classrooms which consist of traditional, systematic, direct instruction because of the pressures we have for test scores and ""no Child Left Behind"" There are some very good samples and charts that give very clear examples of differentiation...the metaphors and analogies are kind of vague and corny...definitely not a ""how to"" book....basically a big, long winded, opinion paper."
5,an essential tool,"I use this tool on a daily basis for my job as a maintenance supervisor. It is most handy for prying molding and trim, but I've used it for dozens of other things like setting carpet, fence demolition, breaking up concrete (in conjunction with a hammer), nail pulling, etc. etc. Tough as hell and a superior design. You'll use this tool a lot more than you think."
5,very useful,"ive used this for everything from remocing deckboards,to taking down base board moulding to taking tires off the rims. it works great the spring steel allows you to ealy pull out the logest of nails.its cheap and very effective with a large range of uses"
3,Good cozy read,"One of the last in the Albert Champion series, a young man engaged to be married is shocked when rumors start to circulate about his parentage. Determined to uncover the truth as to his identity, and with the encouragement of his fiancee's father, he puts their engagement on hold until he finds the answers he seeks. However, there appears to be someone equally determined that he shall not uncover the truth.Albert Champion is engaged to unravel the mystery behind the death of an old lady, and with the help of his friend, Charles Luke, find the answers before someone else is murdered.Albert Champion stays a bit in the background in this book, which is a shame, but it still makes for a good read."
3,Perched on Nothing's Branch,"I thought this was an interesting type of book dealing with the lack of a mother. I didn't look at it as anything sexual with him and his mother. I read it as if he was suffering and coping with the fact that he never received any love from his mother and caused him to have problems as an adult where he would find it hard to have a relationship with a woman, maybe because his mother never cared or loved him. In turn this effected him in the way he loves women."
4,A pleasure reading it,"I don't normally read poetry, but for some reason I really liked this book. The poems were pretty easy to relate to an therefore interpret. I really enjoy reading some of the poems, Whenever I get a chance I'm going to go back and read it again it was quick and easy."
5,Awesome teaching tool,"I teach inservices to school staff and use this book as a basis for the classes I teach. The techniques are easy to follow, with great results and opportunities for exploration above and beyond class time. Teachers enjoy the tools the program has and the book brings the tools to them in a manner even the most inexperienced is able to easily follow. This book is a tool that can be followed when away from class or when staff are in need of either a review or a new technique. I really haven't used the CD that came with it, but I have had it available for the staff and they feel it is a positive asset and a tool within itself."
5,Hermoso libro lleno de detalles,"Es la segunda vez que compro este libro, su calidad de impresion es magnifica y su contenido muy bien pensado y organizado, rico en información y detalles sobre la creacion de la pelicula, personajes musica, ambientes y proceso de diseño. Realmente recomiendo este libro para todo aquel que gusta del arte de la animacion cuadro por cuadro."
1,"Please go away, Dan.","This book is written by a Red Sox ""fan"" who seems to hate all the players on the team. His colums are racist, pessimistic and negative. It's upsetting that people from around the world think actual Red Sox fans are like this. We're not, and outpouring of happiness in this city since our Foulke flipped to Meintkiewicz proves this. Shut up, Dan. No one wants to hear your tired rhetoric."
1,Now irrelevant,"Shaughnessy now has to find a different schtick; the Sox have won the World Series, and now we won't have to hear about made-up curses ever again. Go Sox!"
3,From the bleachers.....,"Since I enjoy baseball so much, I enjoyed this book. I enjoyed the author's inserts of seemingly mysterious coincidences and voodoo. And it was definitely an education on the history of the Bosox. I found myself empathizing for all those Bean towners. But it's pretty naive of the author and his sources to think there are no baseball fanatics outside of New England. Even Peter Gammons has called St. Louis the best baseball town in the country. Sometimes a bit slow, but usually interesting and fun."
5,A great coffee table book!,The photographs of the young Mrs. Kennedy are absolutely spectacular. Congratulations Jacques!
3,One for the Drummers Collection,"Steve Jordan... FUNKY? yes! INOVATIVE? definately! I really find his use of the drums inspiring, but found that there was not enough breakdown of rythym structures in this perticular DVD for learning purposes. Still though, I brought it for my library because basically I love the drums and drumming! Have fun and be funky"
4,Worth Every Penny to Hear John and Tracks not on the DVD,"I agree with the others that the DVD clearly contains the better audio (it should, it`s a DVD) but the CD is well worth it and in my opinion their best album in at least 20 years (excluding compilation material and re-releases).Of course nothing comes close to a substitute for a live Who concert, I got to see them on their 2002 tour (unfortunately without John, who, incidentally, gives one of the greatest bass solos I`ve heard during 5`15 on this CD).This CD also contains songs not on the DVD like Mary Ann with the Shaky Hand and a Bonus Disc that in itself makes this a worthwhile purchase in my opinion.I was reluctant to shell out the cash having already owned the DVD, but I have never regretted the purchase."
4,I Can't Explain!,"From the opening riff of ""I Can't Explain,"" done with the distortion that the original called for, it is clear that this is to be a release to not be forgotten.Singer Roger Daltrey may no longer have the wailing vocal chops he once had, but left is certainly enough to drive a band that musically now sounds better then they ever did. The setlist is excellent, covering much of their best-known and best material, the sound quality perfect.It's The Who equipped for the 21st century ... some elements may be slightly lacking from the original (the vocals) and some elements are largely improved (mainly the guitar.) If you're into the Who and you want a live album, find The Kids Are Alright to document their early era, and then look no further than right here for something that covers the bulk of their hits through the years, with more fire than the original versions you might find on any greatest hits compilations.Reccomended."
4,Good short introduction to The Ring,"This CD serves well as a FIRST introduction to Wagner, which it is for me. Others who are more familiar with the operas may think that a single-CD collection could not be enough to form a good introduction. I give it four stars mainly because I'm not knowledgeable enough to give it five stars reliably."
5,Fabulous,"The Director's Edition: Boot Leg of Almost Famous is my favorite DVD. The directors commentary with Cameron Crowe and his mom is fabulous and leaves me craving his next movie. Cameron's love of music and film really shines in Almost Famous. And the cast is just perfect!! This film has a special place in my heart and this edition makes me love it even more. Please check out the audio of ""Small Time Blues"" with Pete Droge and Elaine Summers, its a little tribute to Gram Parson and Emmylou Harris and it is just beautiful...."
5,Best Movie Ever!,Almost Famous is the best movie I've ever seen...and probably ever will see. I was born a generation too late to experience the 60's and 70's (grr) but I got a pretty good idea of what they were like. I liked how at the beginning the kid is going through all the records..I thought that was neat.That movie was the best!
2,WOW - how incredibly mediocre,"This movie was obviously put out in a year of some pretty weak movies. The fact that this movie was actually nominated for awards is beyond explanation. Let's talk about Kate Hudson (you know she is Goldie Hawn's daughter - make me puke). I cannot believe she was nominated for an award - for what? She is an empty suit. I've seen better acting from the Olsen twins. I guess it is good to be related to the right people. This movie has one interesting angle, the start of a journalist's career. Other than that, I think everybody should face the fact that this movie was supposed to be a view of the ""wild and decadent 70's"" and was nothing more than a poorly acted (Kate Hudson, Jason Lee) hollywood production - nothing decadent about it. The Soundtrack - big deal - listen to any classical rock station for more than an hour and I guarantee you will hear the entire soundtrack - nothing special."
5,Great coming of age story.,"I have watched this film several times over the years, and each time i see something new. A great film about a genious 15 year old true fan of music that gets the break of a lifetime to write for rolling stone magazine. He gets to go on the road with Stillwater, a fictional band, in 1973. But the music is great, the story is good, and you really get to know the characters. Definite collection film, also available is a directors cut."
5,One of my favorite movies of all time.,"This movie just rocks... and in this case that isn't just an expression. Almost Famous would be a good movie under any circumstances. The story is well-written, the acting is almost uniformly excellent, the cinematography is really sharp, etc. But let's face it, what really makes this movie is the music. Best. Soundtrack. Ever. If you grew up during the 60's, 70's, and even the early 80's the music in this movie was the soundtrack of your life. Watching this movie is almost like being back there again. I can't believe it's selling for under eight bucks. What a bargain. Don't pass it by."
4,"Well-done, entertaining","ALMOST FAMOUS is a well-crafted comedy about writer/director Cameron Crowe's real-life adventures as a precocious teenage rock and roll journalist in the seventies. It has wit, great pacing and editing, and a big heart. The music is okay though it can never be mistaken for being the soul of the story; the soul belongs to the characters. All the characters are fully realized but Kate Hudson, whose character Penny Lane insists she is the rock group's muse not its groupie, takes her role to greater depths without eating the scenery. She deserved the Oscar nomination. Ultimately, the film is a bit gentle--it does not amend or revise our cultural insight into the era and environment it portrays; it is not a take-no-prisoners satire; it does not bleed--and that's why I'm giving it a 4 rather than a 5. It does deserve a 5 for what it is not--not another gross-out comedy, not a violent movie, not unwise, not a badly made movie of which we are seeing way too much these days."
3,all hype,"this movie is hardly what i expected, i enjoyed it but it did not deserve any oscar nominations or such critical acclaim. cameron crowe is going down in the quality of his films (vanilla sky is a terribly messy movie and the ending is totally dumbed down.) i would suggest fast times at ridgemont high and jerry maguire over this flick any day."
3,Almost is never enough!,"The autobiographic feature has always intrinsic limitations. To conceptualize or even depict, the personal experiences around the lives and times of a decade like the roaring late sixties and the irreverent early seventies, in which literally nothing was forbidden, demands from you a true challenge, due there is enough documented filmic material around this issue.In this sense, the material is interesting but the film to my view falls respect its anecdotic feature, without exploring another important factors that permeated those times.At the end of the movie I remained unsatisfied because of the fact the enormous deficit between the generated expectations and the achieved objective.In musical terms: excess of legato."
2,It's Not All That.....,I'd rather mow the lawn than watch this again! The movie was slow going and not exciting in the least. A story about a musical journalist KID that rides along with a bad on tour and experiences life on the road. The movie is not all that!!! Those that gave this movie such high ratings haven't seen a good movie in a long time. Where's my lawnmower.....
2,Drag,"What a lousy film. I was looking forward to it. It had an unwelcome ""the-anger-of-ugly-people"" plot. Who cares? But the good looking people didn't even have any charisma at all. Billy Crudup is DULL. I was appalled when this script won an Oscar. I thought it was tired and boring and I was wishing the plane would crash in the plane-almost-crashing scene, because at least then the movie would have ENDED."
1,Hipper-Than-Thou!,"This movie gets one star from me. Heck, it earned it, didn't it? If this wasn't the number one film of the century, it was ay least the number one film of the year. Cameron Crowe's hipper-than-thou opus is one of the greatest pieces of art in the history of American cinema, and with two rising stars in Billy Crudup and Kate Hudson, this is the film that brings generations together. It is a bridge between the 70's and 90's that reminds us that above all, we are all people; living, breathing entities who NEED each other. This could be the glue of humanity, bringing down all racial, generational, and national barriers. What do I love about rock 'n roll? EVERYTHING...and more!!!"
2,The author seriously needs to research her resources,I was intrigued by the subject of a woman surviving in the medieval times of england. The author seriously needs to research her resources since the circumstances she describes seem more befitting biblical times. Any person somewhat familiar with medieval history should be thrown off! However her style was pleasing.
4,Eye opener to the cultural jihad,This film is a real eye opener to the hidden jihad lurking in our country. It's sad that CAIR banned this film to be seen as part of a counter-terrorism training for the NYPD. Zudhi Jasser who is a devout muslim himself is a genius at converying his feelings against radical jihad. He is a real voice for the muslims out there who are afraid to speak against the issue of hidden Jihad lurking in our country.
1,arrived damaged,DVD packaging arrived damaged and appears it would not have occurred during transit...If Amazon chooses to sell or ship defective merchandise then at least say they are seconds and reduce the price. I will not be ordering DVD's in the future from AMAZON. Return of merchandise went smoothly without any problems with credit to account happy about that fact.
4,worth watching,"This movie does come across a little bit as a bit slanted and alarmist, but then again the host is a self-proclaimed Muslim who fears radicalism and presents a lot of facts and evidence to support his view that homegrown radicals in the West are underestimated... The fact that hate speech proliferates North American Islamic centers and that Western countries have stopped (and not stopped) numerous small and large-scale terrorist attacks since 9/11 not all of which were perpetrated by al-Qaida but home-grown independent extremists is something I think should certainly not be brushed off as phobic fear-mongering..."
1,not as advertised,"I have tried to buy this CD from two different Amazon vendors, both times it was actually some other unrecognizable music, not related to Toots and the Maytals, even though the actual CD was labeled as if it was Toots. I suspect that wherever you buy this CD, it will not be what you expect."
3,"classic LPs, terrible mastering","As others have posted, this CD compiles two sublime LPs from Toots and the Maytals, and easily rates 5 stars. My vinyl copy of Funky Kingston became a symphony of crackles and pops because I had played it so often. Unfortunately, the current collection does a real disservice to the music. In place of the warm and clear analog production of the originals, the recordings on the current CD are muffled and extremely muddy. I'm not an audio snob, but really, I find the CD to be almost unlistenable, which is a tragedy given that this is such joyful funky music."
3,TERRIBLE RECORDING!,The other reviewer is right. This issue is very bad in it's sound quality.I love to see a clean and true copy of the two LPs.Even one cd for one LP is OK too.Would still be worth the buying price.
1,Don't buy,This movie was so bad. It had some insightful information but that was only 3 minutes of the movie. This movie would be funny if you were a middle-aged yuppie.
5,Fun making music,I have been really having allot of fun with Play Music. I hope to get a keyboard to use with this for christamas.
3,Camry specs,"The book is fine for nuts and bolts stuff, but it does not contain any technical specifications. How do you check an OHM rating if you don't know what the spec is? More detail Haynes! Plus it tells you what could be causing the problem, but not how to narrow it down."
2,"Basic reference, needs work!","This needs a lot of work, not very clear, lousy pictures, no clear instructions.... Has a lot of detail, but overall, not very useful."
4,Good,"It's good! But nothing mind-blowingly amazing. Covers all, a good read, but I can't say it helped me any more then practice."
4,Great Book,As a beginner in the DJ life this book taught me the in's and out's of DJing. I highly recommend it for beginners and veterans to learn something new!
2,Too short to be much use,"This DVD instruction video is only 38 minutes long. There is not a real lot that can be covered in this time. The instructor goes through care of the instrument and how to hold it quite well, but only 5 notes are taught (Bflat, C, D Eflat and F), and there are only two tunes learnt (Hot Cross Buns and Go Tell Aunt Rhody).Also, the presenter seems slightly stiff, as though she is reading from cue cards for the length of the film, which I found quite distracting."
1,A major disappointment,"The first thing you should know about this book is it's based on the 1975 season, which means that none of the umpires or players mentioned are contemporary.Beyond that, this is poorly done and unethically done at that. Late in the book, the author admits that he pretended to be sleeping in order to eavesdrop on the conversation between two umpires in a hotel room. He says he threw away drinks and pretended to be drunk so they'd talk openly in front of him.If the ethics don't bother you, consider this: how accurate are the conversations he quotes, considering he had no tape recorder and reconstructed them after the fact? Could you relate word-for-word a conversation you had with a co-worker this morning?Baseball umpires could be the subject for a great book. This isn't it."
4,Informative,"This is a great book, it definitely gives a different outlook on ancient Egypt compared to what you see on tv. I also appreciate the authors way of making it easier to understand."
4,Decent movie with great scenes of Brittany Daniel,This was an overall OK movie - the stand out was Brittany Daniel. She is not shy about shedding her clothes as she enjoys sex parties and threesomes. In one scene we get a very long scene of her naked backside as she walks through her house - that alone is worth watching this movie.
3,Rampage: The Hillside Strangler Murders,"This is the Hillside Strangler film that everyone was talking about because of Brittany Daniel's nude scenes. Here it is finally released as Rampage: The Hillside Strangler Murders. I rented this picture about a day after it was released on DVD. It's not a great work of art by anymeans, but at under 90 minutes it is fairly watchable. Probably most recommend to fans of Brittany Daniel. She is smokin'"
5,Great cd!,"Being recently introduced to the whole idea of feng shui I found this cd to be very useful. Having feng shui tips backed with music, result in a ""must have"" cd."
3,Well Made,I purchased these strings because the used guitar that I bought from a friend had them on it already. I needed to replace some individual (broken) strings and I was a bit rough on the old strings. I've gotten used to using Gore-Tex type strings which are much more durable. These have a good feel and tone though.
3,Funny and sweet,"The Baxter is funny and sweet. It's not as good as the Stella shorts, but everyone is there. An enjoyable comedic indie movie."
1,the baxter tells how they made the movie,this will becoming out on january 17th on dvd michael showalter movie is the least rate for a movie and for his good show stella is much better
3,underated,"Here is a relatively unknown band with a lot of talent. Some of the stuff on other releases gets a little soft and sappy.. this is their best work with the lost classic (Hang on for your life). One of the top ten driving songs of all time.If this doesn't make you floor it nothing else will. You could buy this just for that one song however Hollywood,She's got money and Breakout are excellent as well. Some filler but overall worth purchasing."
5,Lanzar amp,Sick amp had it for years blew lots of subs and pounded lots of em too. lots of watts i feel the amps underrated.
5,"Easy reading, Informative, and packed with tips!","This book will give you an edge over the competition! Packed with tips, and information to market your business effectively on the web the quick and easy way. A great book to have."
4,"Very good, especially for business folks new to the net!","Chase is obviously savvy and yet writes in a style easily assimilated by the novice. Perhaps his use of novice Nancy Hangar aided him in his ""beginner-friendly"" approach."
5,Best Anime DVD Ever!!!,"Yes, everyone, I said that this is the best ever. Someone who hasn't seen the previous volumes could watch this and understand quite a bit of what is going on. The story is beautifully played out. The events will leave you breathless, raising the questions of what happens next and why.Then, of course, there is the animation. Your eyes will bulge at the sights created during the events that take place. And there's even more eye-popping stuff with the extras.So if you like anime, and especially this series, pick this DVD up. It is impossible to be disappointed buy it.Bide your time, and hold out hope."
3,Warning Batteries,"Some replacement batteries are hard to find.If this is the one that fits your alarm,it works well and lasts over three years."
4,"Review of ""In the name of the father","""In the name of the father"" is a movie based on a true story about the Northern Ireland conflict. After some trouble with the IRA, a young man from Belfast, Gerry Conlon, has to move to London. Together with some friends, Gerry Conlon, gets judged for a crime he didn't commit. We follow their struggle against the English legal system. We enjoyed the film and strongly recommend it to everyone who wants to see a good movie about the Northern Ireland conflict."
3,Good movie!,"Daniel Day-Lewis is a fine actor and this is an interesting tale. Not a must view, but worth renting."
1,Are you really buying a new ipod or is apple cheating you!,"Apple may be selling you a used ipod. I found out today that the ipod I paid $299.00 for was actually refurbished. It had been repackaged, presented and sold to me as a new ipod. This company has a class action lawsuit against it for this, among other claims. You can view the class action lawsuit by googling ""tell on apple.""Don't get cheated the way I did!And if you do buy an ipod, keep the receipt."
1,Second one and still doesn't work,"Returned the first one because I got a ""Firmware update failure"" which could not be rectified regardless of what http://www.apple.com/support/ipod/ said. Several down loads and no resolution of the problem resulted in my returning the unit. Second unit does the same. Surfed the web and found this to be a common problem. Will not buy an apple product again. Not just because of the problem with this iPod but because of the lack of support. Apple thinks that a customer forum where the customers try to assist each others is support. It isn't in my opinion."
4,A note on Benjamin's comment,"This is in the response to Benjamin's comment about the ipod encrypting cd's are mp3 you pull into itunes:hey it doesn't have to ""encrypt"" the music you store on it. On my ipod i like to mess with the encoding settings to get a bit bettter quality (up to 320kpbs), but you can still go the standard route (192kbs) interchaing the AAC for the MP3 format: (no difference really apple says that AAC is a little better in conserving memory but the difference is too marginal to really matter)Here's how:Edit -> Preferences -> Advanced -> Importing Tab -> Import using Mp3 encoderThat way when you do manage to pull out the music from your ipod using third party software you won't have to worry about the format not being compatible on another player."
1,Application hangs scanning for audio plug-ins.,"Title tells all. Even SF won't answer the question, other than to hem and haw about how to ""disable the plugins and bring them back online one by one"". Not explained is how to ""disable the plugins and bring them back online one by one."" But, then why would I be surprised, since SF appears to have be 'downsized' after 'buyout'."
3,It all came from hearing them in a bar,"And before I knew it I was asking the waitress who was that playing on the cd and here we are. Nice, chill, and laid back is the best way to descibe what I get from the disc."
4,Works for me!,Decent pictures and simply written so that my kids and I could understand it easily. Very good resource for those looking to start a reef aquarium.
1,Horrible sweet,"It is one of the worst sweets ever. Do not buy this product. I tried it out thinking it was going to be good, just realized its horrible. This sweet is definitely not meant for kids, just wondering who its meant for."
5,Back to School is Murder,"In his second Steve Asher mystery, The Mad Season, Blanchard sharpens his craft while losing none of the charm of the first. The story is more of a whodunit than Murder at Walden Pond, but Blanchard still centers the story with his reluctant, appealing sleuth Asher. Blanchard also has a gold mine of a setting: a public school. Is there any place in the world as people intensive as a public school? They are places of shifting loyalties, lifelong friends, career long grudges... and there is a shaky hierarchy of superintendents and principals trying to impose order on a world that is intrinsically messy. Blanchard not only takes you back to school but lets you delight in the chaos."
1,Kaplan CSET,"I took the CSET exam July 10, 2010 This book was not helpful other than for music section. I was upset at the amount of paid for the book,"
5,Great Music- Beautiful Sounds,This was a really great CD. The music was simply breathtaking. This is Mozart at his best.
4,Nice product,"My tomtom's car charger is broken. Tomtom's replacement mini USB charger is expensive. More importantly, I think Tomtom shouldn't get an extra busyness because of the bad quality of their products. So I bought this mini-USB charger. It works as I expected. My only complaint is that the curling cable pulls my GPS too tightly."
2,Disappointing,"If you have any common sense of your own, you don't need this book. Having been supervised yourself should have taught you these basics, such as ""Don't criticize superiors"" and ""Be patient and calm"" I also didn't care for the bullet/list style of writing."
5,North nails it!,"North has done his homework and put together a truly educational journey through history and literature. North clears the way to better understanding of the old Gods, their roots and the language used on the continent and in Anglo-Saxon England. He demonstrates how early historians and writers re-mapped and influenced so much of what modern scholars and Heathens hold dear by the way of Icelandic poems, sagas and other early writings. (Beowulf included) After reading this your eye and ear will be more the keener to any text you digest in your studies of Northern ways and history. If you are among the Vanir, this is a must read. If Woden is of interest to you, this is a must read. This book is indispensable.Yes, pricey. Worth every dollar."
1,"Bad quanlity, not worth to buy","The touch feeling is so bad, orginal price $300 is rediculous, the upper layer of the comforter has many scratches, thread is falling down, this is the first item I returned in the website."
1,WRONG PRICE,THE PRICE OF THIS ITEM ON DEALS2BUY.COM IS $29.99. AFTER CLICKING ON THE PRODUCT IT DIRECTS YOU TO AMAZON .COM WHERE THE PRICE IS 59.
4,Indespensible for a Recipe or Nutrition Junkie,"If you create your own recipes and like to keep an organized log of them, this is a great product. I love storing the recipes I create and running the nutrition facts to find out where I can adjust. It comes with a variety of cookbooks already stored, none of which I've tried. Considering that this is the CD rom that came with one of my textbooks required for one of my culinary classes, I don't think you can go wrong."
2,Good but out-dated material,This video is good but is out-dated (from the 80's) and not in line with John Lyons current training methods. Pass this one over for his newer material.
5,nice wood feel,"great little guiro with a REAL wood sound. No plastic, flat, superficial sound, but a nice -small- warm sound, ideal for acoustic projects."
1,Tree-hugger only,The teacher who teaches this is an enviromentalist wacko and this book can be used solely for that purpose.
1,Sent me an OLD EDITION,I searched for this text book using ISBN that the school gave me. I realized once I go to class that this was 2 editions old!!! It would have been nice to know that it was an out of date edition.
5,All of the Details at My Fingertips,"I've been waiting for this one! FileMaker Pro 7 has added many very useful features to this venerable database product and I've been anxious to figure out how best to use them; the FileMaker Pro 7 Bible nicely fills the bill.All of the basics are covered, of course, but what I find most valuable are the more advanced capabilities of FileMaker: scripts, web publishing, relationships between tables (the relationship graph), access to XML and ODBC, and much more. Of particular personal interest is the ability to do things like send an email in response to a change in the database (which I've wanted to do in my bug database).Whenever I'm tweaking my various FileMaker databases this book will certainly be open on my desk-it's a wonderful reference!"
4,Great basic book on what spiritual direction is all about!,Ever wonder why your spiritual life is going nowhere? Ever been in the spiritual desert? This book nicely explains what spiritual direction is and isn't. I enjoyed learning about the role of spiritual companions and how they support your prayer life. This book was worth the investment.
3,I Didn't Hate It,"This was my first Christina Skye book and I would have to say that overall I enjoyed it. However, I do agree with some other reviews that it jumped around a lot and you were never sure where the characters were; first they were on a cruise ship, then the island, then Paradise Cay, then someone's guest house, back to the cruise ship and finally held hostage somewhere, there was too much moving around. I also found the ending a little hurried; it went from of course beating the bad guys to ""I Love you Forever"" to eight months later to an epilogue still later."
4,A fast and entertaining read,"My first Christina Skye book, and it won't be my last. I did find myself having to reread sections at times; but for the most part it was very well written. BUT maybe McKay DID fall a little ""too easy"" for a SEAL. Other than that, the only disappointment was I was waiting for Izzy and Daphne to get together...maybe some other cruise? All in all, a very enjoyable read that I would highly recommend."
1,See the TV series,"This book is not even close to the excellent and engaging BBC TV series from which it is derived. It contains a lot of information but it is presented in the ""old style - school book"" rambling of dates and kings and it does not at all make history alive. See the TV series, or buy the tapes, when available, instead of buying the book."
1,A review of excerpts,"Traveling in England for the last few weeks, I found myself anxiuosly awaiting the weekend edition of ""The Daily Telegraph"" (incidentily the last remaining legitimate newspaper in England) in order to read excerpts of this facinating work.Historically sound to the point that the BBC is releasing an educational series based on Simon Schamas retelling of the amazing history of Great Britain.Don't wait for the movie, educate yourself by reading all of the words."
3,imperfect and in need of an editor,"This book is a compelling story, like other Schama books but . . . boy oh boy, did the editor get ill towards the end of the job or what? Seems it was sent straight to press without a final read. There are numerous examples where historical characters suddenly appear in the narrative with no context, no introduction, and then just as mysteriously, simply disappear! I'm glad I own the book but it is neither a resource for a history of Britain (too many gaps) nor does it offer the kind of consistent and sweeping perspective that I expect from Schama. When it's good, it's good; when the editor was asleep or ill, it's frustrating."
3,No New Song!!!,How can a Howard Jones comp not have New Song???!!! That's his signature hit! It's a massive SIN! Better off getting the other collections instead like Best Of.
1,Did ANYONE bother to edit the Kindle version?,"The Kindle version of this book is practically unreadable. There are typos and formatting problems on almost every page. How can you even charge for this? Is it really that hard to spell check the file before you put it up for sale? Does it cost too much? Is it not in your budget? You do realize that people actually like to READ the books they buy, right?Seriously, is this some kind of joke?"
2,Misleading,"The picture implies five items - this is misleading. There are only three items: the A/C adapter, the car charger and the retractable USB cord. Additionally, the USB cord connection to my Sansa Fuze did not fit! When contacted, the seller did not offer to replace it - they just stated that it was the correct one. I bought the kit specifically for the A/C adapter, and that works fine, so I'm not returning the kit. But I wouldn't buy anything else from this seller."
4,"False Overlord, Ture Hero","1. Not a roam free style Action-RPG, just a eady liner action adventure.2. The single-player mode is a solid work , but multiplayer is very lag due to too many minions on the screen.3. the Minions are cute and fun, but its auto camera angle is not some smart when you need control Overload and Minions at the same time.4. the level riddle is easy."
5,Excellent performance,"I have the 1984 release of these performances, and I LOVE that disc. The 40th is one of my favorite pieces, and Bernstein's performance is clear and perfectly paced. The 41st is also a great performance. At this price, the disc is a great buy!"
2,Mozart Symphonies 40/41 - Bernstein,"The Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra has rightly been regarded as one of the world's premiere orchestras for almost a century. Under both Klemperer and Karajan, they have been particularly noted for their performances of the Beethoven Symphonies.However, this recording shows it takes more than a reputation to create an excellent symphonic performance; a lot depends on the interpretation of the conductor, and here, sadly, Bernstein did not rise to the occasion. The interpretation of Mozart's arguably best symphonies is tedious and without any inspiration, and the first movement of the 40th symphony especially displays this in it's sluggishnes and lack lustre tempo.Having heard many performances of these two symphonies jointly and seperately, I would have to say this is one CD that I wish I had not purchased. I have better, more invigorating recordings of these works, and sadly this CD is likely to just sit on the shelf, collecting dust!"
4,Logitech QuickCam Pro 9000 review,"The camera itself is very good and give a nice clear picture (only if you have a good connection and screen), the sound is good. The big downside on this camera is that is does not sit well and does not clip onto anything to keep it stable. It has some adjustment to align it but not enough."
5,Buy this webcam!,"Logitech has made my life better with this webcam. I recommend that everyone who wants to look good on the net buy this. Good price, great performance."
5,Great Webcam!,"This webcam is easy to use, all you have to do is insert it in your computer, as a USB. The quality of the picture is very good. I would definitely recommend buying this webcam."
4,I would buy it again,The Logitech 2MP webcam pro 9000 was easy to setup. What I really like is how Logitech provides on online medium through which to video chat. My parents love it because they can see their grandkids and read books to them over the internet. The picture quality and sound quality are very good. I am satisfied with this product and would buy it again.
5,Pro 9000 is the best webcam,I have owned 4 webcams and the Logitech Pro 9000 is the best by a large margin. I like the way it follows you so you don't have to sit rigid in a chair. Its low light ability is fantastic which means you don't look like a creature from a horror movie because most of your room lights are located behind you. A superb instrument and easy to install.
5,A great gift for family across the country,This camera was a great gift for my brothers late wifes family in California.They can keep in touch visably seeing they all have young children so they can remain familiar to them until they see each other live.
5,Newest QuickCam is Great!,"The Logitech QuickCam Pro9000 is a leap above the original QuickCam we used for several years! We are amazed at the better clarity, motion tracking and improved transmission quality. Well worth the higher cost."
4,"Good product, easy set up.",Good product recommended by a more experienced friend. Very satisfied with both performance and ease of installation and set up.
3,Not as expected,"The video quality of the camera is great.The packaging was not retail, but bulk, and appeared to have been opened and the camera had some minor scratches; but since it worked correctly, I wasn't going to go through all the hassle of returning and exchanging. I expected it to be supplied by Amazon, but it appears it came from a third-party vendor.The applications that came with it on CD, worked great; then there came the notification to update. After the update the manual resolution adjustments disappeared. I re-in stalled the camera from scratch to get them back. How can manufacturers screw-up a great product??? In the last ten years, this seems to happen more frequently.If I had to do it over again, since I use the camera mostly for Skype, I would probably have purchased a lesser model."
4,Logitech Quick Cam Pro 9000,"A very bright,sharp and portable camera in all conditions. I will recommend this Camera to all my friends."
5,Logitech QuickCam Pro 9000 is awesome,"This webcam works perfectly. I use it for skype with windows vista. To the reviewer who says that this doesn't work well with vista: it is likely an issue with your computer, because it works great for me. I installed it in about 15 minutes and it works perfectly. I love it. This cam has super high quality video (HD) and photos (8 mexapixel). I use it to talk to my girlfriend to conserve cell phone minutes and I began to actually prefer the skype+webcam over using a cell phone. It doesn't cost that much more than the lower end models and is nicer looking and has much better quality video. Buy this."
2,Not worth the money,"This webcam is one of the more expensive ones, so I expected longevity and better function. However, mine is freezing constantly when it's only 2 years old. The video would freeze after only 2-5 minutes of use, and it would be choppy throughout that time. It is not an internet problem or a computer problem, as I have tried other video programs, and my internet connection is stable and fast. I have uninstalled and re-installed the Logitech drivers, used different USB sockets, and all to no avail. I even read a forum that said to try uninstalling all drivers and using the automatic Windows driver. Still the same exact problem. Freezes the video and if I'm lucky, the mic still works, but usually that doesn't work either.This product is not worth the money. Logitech did not make this the quality product they claim it to be, and their drivers for this product do absolutely nothing."
5,logitech 9000,"I originaly had purchased another web cam and could not get it to work on my new computer which has windows vista. I purchased the Logitech 9000 and was skeptical that it would work. It is wonderful just put the softwear in and plug the cam in and your ready to use it. Everyone that I chat with commented on the clarity of the picture and the good sound that it has. I would recomend this web cam to anyone with vista, it is fantastic."
2,Doesnt SKYPE for me,"I read the reviews and read the computer qualifications for the webcams----my computer meets the requirements---so I got this one, thinking it would be easy to just install and SKYPE ......Unfortunately, it works fine on OTHER computers, but not mine.The webcam ITSELF works fine---(good quality picture, etc) but when you try to SKYPE with it---it freezes up when you get the second image there (them plus you). We tried setting the resolution etc as ""low quality"" as we could---and it still does that.I'm just frustrated that I bought this instead of a $10-15 model that probably doesnt have as great a quality, but....hah....probably would do what I wanted to do with it.(sigh)....."
3,Logitech webcam pro9000 review,"The webcam is very easy to install and get it working. The mounting leg used to support the webcam in place is well designed and because of it you may place it over different objects and/or locations and will remain stable. According to reviews read this webcam was rated one of the best. However, I would disagree because its auto focus or even manual focusing does not provide those looking at you a clear focused view."
4,Very easy to use with a clear picture!,I bought this camera last week after becoming disgusted with my 2 yo Microsoft camera that was supposed to be compatible with Vista but wasn't. I was a little anxious that this one might not work properly with it either but the install went very smoothly and the camera worked right away after the installation and so far no compatibility issues at all.
3,"great video, distorted audio","The picture quality is excellent. However, in most instances you can not understand each other. The audio cuts in and out, or there is a lot of static."
1,Frustrating,"Skype recognizes this video cam, but has a problem with the microphone part, the right side of the Pro 9000 device. To use the microphone I have to unplug and replug this Pro 9000 into my computer USB port every time I start up. My computer remembers the webcam but not the microphone, at least with Skype. Logitech send me a long list of instructions to correct this problem, many hoops to jump through. Result? Same old problem. I would not buy this webcam/microphone again, huge pain in the neck."
5,One Excellent Product,"You could not ask any more. Easy to install and easy to use. Very good picture quality. Microphone works good. A little more expensive than the ones you see at the stores, but it is worth the difference."
5,My best webcam yet,"I've had many webcams in my day and this one is the best so far. It has high definition capabilities in Fullscreen and Widescreen. This webcam kept me from buying a lamp that I was going to put in my room to brighten up the picture. It has a mode that lets you see in lower lit rooms, which is perfect for my bedroom."
2,Barely supported on Mac OS X,Only outputs a mirror image on Mac OS X.Apparently on Microsoft machines there is software to give a normal picture. I wish there were a little switch to toggle between normal mode and the bizarre default mirror image mode (as is the case for other small cameras I have used).Video/audio quality is acceptable except for the bass ackwords picture.Buyer beware.
5,9000 Pro...Excellent,The Logitech QuickCam 9000 Pro is an excellent product. Easy to install and setup. It is an excellent choice.
1,Not recommended for laptops - sound quality horrible,"The video is not quick for movements and is rather fuzzy. The sound quality is horrific so we just use cell phones to talk and mute the speakers on both computers.Also, the software received was out of date and until we upgraded, the cameras did not recognize when your 'friends' were available so you could never connect with them.All in all, not a good buy at all. If I had to do it all over again, I wouldn't pay $10.00 a piece for these. The stand alone doesn't work so the camera has to be held unless you velcro it to the computer."
5,Really great product,"Like the majority of these reviews say, this is a great webcam. The right size, weight, and really clear and quality sound/picture.All things considered, there is no better one to buy at this point."
5,Great Item!,This item was so easy to install(Do not bother with the software just plug in andyour computer will do the rest.)Install time?About 10 min.Our whole family has enjoyed seeing everyone!!
5,Connecting with family up and down the East Coast,"I bought this camera so I could video conference with other family members up and down the East Coast. Not only did I buy this camera but my sister bought 1 and my nephew bought 5 for Christmas gifts. With the cameras that are online before Christmas day the quality of the picture coming to me is very good quality. It really depends on the room lighting, on the camera end, and the person using the camera ability to adjust the camera's settings correctly. Over all very simple to setup and use. Sound quality of the camera is also very good. The faster the internet connection the better the experience and less voice delays.I am looking forward to connecting with additional family members after Christmas. We usually only get to see nieces and nephews at family events every few years. Now we can watch as the Great Nieces and Nephews grow up."
4,Lots of cam for the money!,"This camera is so easy to use and installation is quick and easy. I have owned several other cams in the past, but I prefer the simplicity of the Logitech Quick Cam Pro 9000. Pictures are very clear and focus is really sharp. This one does all the work for you."
1,Burns out USB ports on HP laptops,"I loved this webcam on my Windows desktop. Then I hooked it up to my brother's Windows HP laptop and it burnt out the USB port. I have no idea how. I wasn't sure it would work on the laptop, but figured if it wouldn't work it wouldn't work, not that it would burn out USB ports on the laptop and also ruin the USB plug on the webcam, rendering it useless.I found one recent review on the CNet site (http://reviews.cnet.com/webcams/logitech-quickcam-pro-9000/4864-6502_7-32509550-13.html)which states the same problem. I would appreciate any feedback on how this happens and whether there are any ways to repair the USB ports on the HP laptop. Thanks."
1,Don't buy this camera to use with Microsoft Netmeeting,When I try to use this camera with Windows Netmeeting and the current drivers my system blue screens over and over. The issue was duplicated with Level 1 support at logitech by blue screening their machine. Software level 11.8.Note dropping back to driver 11.5 allows this camera to work with netmeeting... Support when pushed explained.
4,"Excellent camera, good quality and easy to use.",Also very good at taking pictures or movies of things going on in the room.
1,"No improvement, very disappointing.","I bought this to upgrade from another Logitech cam I bought 2-3 years ago. This new cam is absolutely identical to the old one. I can find no improvements whatsoever. The resolution is no better 640x480, forget what the adverts say, the rest is software enhanced. The picture quality is exactly the same as the old cam which is poor. I can't understand the webcam market. This is supposedly a cutting edge webcam but it takes horrible pictures compared to even the cheapest digital camera. Webcams are still treated as a gimmicky toy for kids with laptops and IM to play with. Very disappointing, save your money. Somewhere there has to be a good webcam I can buy.....Been trying to find one for years, no luck. My crappy old $99 digital camera takes far superior pictures than anyone I have tried or seen. Keep looking. Update--I got it to work at 800x600 but the picture quality and auto-focus are still total unbelievable garbage."
3,Out of focus if sitting more than 4ft away,"I bought this camera for video chatting. I wanted to be able to have it on my 46"" LCD TV and sit on my sofa and chat. However, my sofa is 6 ft away from TV (and camera) and my picture is blurry. it is impossible to focus, auto or manual. If you zoom, and try to focus, the same thing happen. I am not happy with this camera. I believe for $80 you should get a camera that other than offering 8MP (2MB for video) should be able to focus to up to 10FT. I am very disappointed because I already had a camera that was decent, but also couldn't focus on this distance. I think I wasted $80."
5,Excellent Web Cam...Best Yet,This is the best web camera I've found. The video and audio is really clear and it does full screen video via skype very well.
4,A Good Value,Installed on wife's compuer - Camera worked right out of the box. Well worth the price.
4,Good product,"Easy to install, set up accomplished quickly. Good video quality, but quite a bit of lag time. May be my connection speed, but it is business class so I am not sure. Over all, I am satisfied. Very happy with Amazon's service."
2,Logitech 9000 pro,"This camera produced beautiful pictures . However after a short period of time - an hour or two-it ceased to work and I had to either reload the software or reboot my computer. A call to Logitech tech support , answered by a call centre in the Philipines was wholly unsatisfactory, actually a little insulting. After repeated rebooting, I tried the Logitech support again, and this time the Nova Scotia based call centre was very helpful. Still the problem re-appeared, so I gave up and returned the product to Amazon. I re-installed my Logitech E2500, which works very well, but does not have the picture quality of the 9000.The Amazon return process -which I had never had to use before- is very customer friendly, and works well."
5,Completely satisfied,"I am using it for Skype and other conferencing applications. The quality of the audio is great, I know this both because I'm told that by those I communicate with and the fact that someone I Skype with frequently bought the same webcam. The video quality and features are also top notch. The Amazon ""frustration free packaging"" was just that."
4,Logittech Webcam Pro 9000 Review,"I was really surprised at the quality of the photos and video of this web cam! It is better than either of my digital cameras and my video camera. It was easy to set up under Vista - BUT FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS EXACTLY! It is great in low light or in full sunlight. It is a little slow in reacting for sudden movement, especially in low light situations, so a video made with it might be a problem if you want a lot of movement in it. But for video conference calls it works great.I do wish they had made the base a little more tight, because over time it will probably loosen up to much to give an active hold."
4,Pretty decent little webcam,"I bought 2 logictech pro-9000 webcams so that I could skype with my husband when I'm away with work. This product was very easy to install and use. Even though this is his first webcam, my husband quickly figured out how to use it on his own and used the special graphic fun features in the programming to show up with an arrow through his head and other neat little features. The overall quality of the image and sound was very good, even in low light. The grip clip to set the webcam on top works better on computers than my laptop and doesn't like to be nudged, but that's my only complaint so far."
2,"While easy to install, the light settings were awful...","I bought this for my desktop pc after getting a new laptop with a cam built in that I really like. Installation on my Win Vista PC was a snap but unfortunately because I have a window on one side of my desk and a light on the other, it would leave the side of the face with the extra light VERY washed out. I tried to adjust to no avail so returned the product. For me and my office setup, this just did not work to my satisfaction."
5,The Best that Logitech can offer!,I was amazed by the clarity and the features of this product..blew away the competition at this price: 70.00! Check it out(and yourself through the Carl Zeiss)!!!
5,Great Product,"I have only played with the camera for a short period so far, but from what I have seen it works great. The picture is great, especially when using the automatic light adjustment feature. Sound quality is exceptional as well. I have even played with the avatars a little bit and they sync up with your face very well after the setup process."
4,Good basic Webcam,Easy installation and works well. Avatars are nice to play with when talking to Grandkids. Seems to use alot of system resources when on Skype and prefers more lighting than anticipated. Overall a good purchase.
5,Excellent,"My wife and I just had a very dear friend move to Thailand, so we wanted to get on Skype to keep in touch. I didn't want to go with a super budget camera, but I didn't want to break the bank either.This was the perfect compromise. Didn't have to drop a load of cash, but our friend looks crystal clear and can hear us perfectly.This was a piece of cake to install and works like a charm. Thumbs up."
4,Great!,"I bought 4 of these as Christmas presents for my family and they were a huge hit! Everyone had no problem setting them up or using them. The picture quality varies with internet speed and connection, but overall we are all pleased! I have recommended this camera to others already."
3,very disappointing,I was expecting a good camara based on the price. However i have run into several problems with it.First the Software would not install. It would stop mid way on instalation. After several trys i finally went to there website to see if it was something with the cd. When i downloaded there software trough there web site it worked for my Windows xp pc.Secondly if you move around to quickly the video becomes blurry. There is a feature in the logitech software for motion compensation but it's only for a limited time and you can't record during that time.I recomend you purchased something more inexpensive and worth it's price.
3,not quite as good as I had hoped,"this cam does not really function all that well on either yahoo or windows live and I noticed the much cheapers cams my friends used worked as good and mostly better than mine.Is ok I guess, if you dont mind having to constantly keep changing the settings for optimum viewing, instead of either putting on automatic or finding good settings and keeping them.Not a bad camera but I was hoping for more based on what I had read before buying it....I feel I should have bought one of the ones half this price is all.....so so"
2,Poor video quality with Skype,"I bought this camera because I thought I could really get some great quality video - even in High Definition. However, the quality is really bad. After upgrading to all the newest versions of both Logitech's software and Skype, the video quality is still bad when doing video conferencing. The video quality is awesome when I am recording my own videos on my own computer, but that's not why I bought this product. After hours of research and phone support, found out that both parties conferencing require to have computers with DUAL processors and high speed Internet to have High Definition video - quite a limitation!"
3,Second Hand Or Display Set Instead New,"I have read this product reviews and decide to buy. Actually item is perfect itselfBUTItem sold by amazon, and When I received it I have realize that so many small scratches on body of cam. Lens was clean of scratches but body was having so many of scratches , I thought its normal, I went a computer shop here in Singapore and see that new one has no such scratches. It comes with a very simple cartoon box which can easly open, But actual packing is so differnet than what amazon send me, its told about packing on product details but this packing is not that good, Anybody can open the box and change the cam easyly .So definetly you are not the first person open this box.I BELIEVE THEY SEND ME DISPLAY SET OR USED CAM.(Actually I have paid for a new cam but get second hand) I live in singapore and its too hard to return the item again, I just give up not to face hardly and costly returning process.I DON'T RECOMMEND YOU TO BUY THIS CAM in this web page."
1,didn't work,"So frustrating. My 11 year old with dirty blonde fine hair wanted brown ""KATNISS"" hair for a HUNGER GAMES party. We did not want a toxic product and were so excited to find this product. We followed the directions explicitly, but unfortunately, even after an hour process, it did not change her hair at all. It MIGHT be a little darker, but not noticeably."
2,No Friend of Mine,"The backlight is very bright and cannot be dimmed, so don't bother putting it anywhere close to the bed. Of course, isn't that when you most need the alert feature? When you're sleeping? Also, the battery barely holds a charge. And the radio reception is very weak. An extra star for whoever came up with the idea."
3,Pretty nice so far,"I just bought it a couple days ago and so far I am happy. Maybe i'll update this in a few more days but hopefully not. I do have one glitch with it thought but can live with it. The pointer has frozen with no mouse response until I figured out to put it on the charge cradle for a sec and then try and is ok. Or i also hit the learn button whe it freezes and the is ok too. I'm not complaining yet as I've had it 3 days and it's done it twice. If it continues, though, then it's time to update this review. Anyone else have this problem?"
3,Srunk after first wash.,This table cloth looks beautiful. Though it shrunk significantly (about 10 inches in length) after the first wash. I am still going to use it since my table has additional inserts and so it will be fine for some lengths but not for the one for which I bought this tablecloth originally.Also red wine stains did not wash off it completely. The cloth is glossy so it is not very noticeable but if you look closer they are visible.
2,Good Recording Overall but You know Bernstein....,"Bernstein achieved what I hope to if my ambitions to become a conductor are fullfilled...He was an American Icon. This recording is a wonderful example of much of an icon he was...This recording stands as an example of American Freedom. A symbol of our hopes in the modern age.Artisically its wondeful. The accoustics are not the greatest nor the Orchestra. You can tell they were thrown together and are not a tight group.As far as their skill as an Orchestra and their ability to tackle the challenging depths of this symphony goes...they are fine. I think Bernstein in typical fashion, over exaggerates the dynamics. He overplays it as though Berlioz wrote this. However, I could barely hear the basses (my instrument ) introduce the joy theme. They played good but not loud enough.So I think overall its great...Tempos are all a little slow but is otherwise fine here."
2,Not Original Songs,"I mainly bought this for BNH's early hits. This CD has remade versions. They are decent remakes, but unless you can get this cheap, and aren't looking for the original versions, it's not worth it."
1,The most inacurate thing I have ever read,"I got this book from the library because I was doing research on Bonnie Prince Charlie and William Wallace. I didn't read the whole book, but the snatches I did read were really bad. William Wallace didn't grow up in the French court! He wasn't an aristocrat! He was an outlaw and a patriot! I truthfully didn't get past the part about Wallace, and it all left me wondering where on earth did this guy get his information from?! It was like a really bad historic novel, but was worse for the fact that it was supposed to be a history.I give it one star for obvious reasons."
1,Skip this one - not worth it,The essays in this book are painful to read. They lack any sort of creativity and imagination. Reading them almost convinced me not to go to business school because it would mean sitting in classes with these unimaginative writers. Curry and Kasbar put together a terrific book for getting in to college but this one falls short. Buy The Princeton Review Guide to MBA programs instead. The sample essays in that book are much better.
3,Concertos for Karajan...,Mozart and Seifert? I think maybe Mozart and Karajan! Seifert hardly is in the picture! He almost blends into Karajan's orchestra! It's like he's just some guy they picked with no extra-ordinary talent.Poor job as a hornist doing some major horn concertos. (Best job on the orchestral parts I've heard so far though.)Your best bet is to get something more individual and stylistic like Tuckwell's marvelous rendition on EMI with Marriner!
5,Magnificent!,"When this film (or should I say films) came out in 1988, the New York City art house theatre that was showing it did something unusual. You could buy tickets for either movie (and see them on separate days) or you could buy tickets for both (at a discounted price) and watch the whole story in one day. I opted for the one-day marathon. Part 1 ran from 10:00am - 1:00. You then had an hour and a half to go out and grab a bite of lunch. Part 2 started at 2:30 - 5:30pm. As other reviewers have stated, this is a beautifully filmed, detailed and magnificently acted story. Since there is a great deal going on it does require your full attention to detail and storyline. One wonders if they could get away with making a film like this today. At 6 hours in length, they were only able to have one showing a day. It certainly wouldn't be a moneymaker!"
1,Disappointment - Stick to reading because you can't write!,"The content in this book was not worth the paper it was printed on. The writing was stilted and lacked depth. If you plan on being a writer, Ms. Wainger will turn you into a reader. She may be a bigtime editor, but the content was nothing special. There were no real insider tips and advice on getting a publishing house to view your manuscript. You are better off buying Writer's Digest's fiction writing books.It is a short read that will leave you disappointed by its abysmal, repetitive chapters, headtripping statement about the author's expertise and lastly, the tips that never fully materialize. I got the distinct impression the author sat around with other Harlequin bigwigs and boasted about her expertise. She should have taken a writing class or better yet, stick to judging other writer's work because Ms. Wainger was blind to her own nonexistent writing skills."
4,Good Source for Romance Writing!,"This book is extremely easy to follow, as the sections are broken down pretty well, hence the title. There is a bit of ""fluff"" - in other words, there are quite a few things that are common sense that I did not need to read in a book to know about. But the other stuff makes up for it. The sections are broken down into things like Characterization, Developing the Plot, Outlining the Story, etc.I would recommend this book for an aspiring author (or authoress!)"
3,Good information,"Writing a romance novelis something you can do in your spare time to keep your creativity alive. This book is a fun companion to that effort, covering most of the bases in an entertaining way. It never hurts to get lots of opinions, though. [...]"
1,Junky,"I bought this brush in an attempt to replace my well-worn Marilyn brush I've had for at least 5 years. No deal with this brush. The brush did not grab my hair at all, so I threw it right in the garbage. They must be making these brushes with much cheaper materials now. I won't be buying another one."
5,Extraordinary,"A great read! An abundance of details and information that help explain the ""why"" in addition to the what. A wonderful opportunity to learn how English history developed during the period that led to the development of our United States, and a chance to see how British concerns affected the judgments of America."
1,The James Carville of Historians,"Schama has never gotten over the fact that England lost America and the British Empire, and that since 1915 Anerica has been financing the British government. Like Carville, Schama makes broad and provocative statements that are not supported by credible evidence. On a recent Bill Moyer's program, he claimed that America had ""Declared itself to be an empire"". Apparently, Schama is the only person who witnessed this ""declaration"". Maybe he witnessed some UFOs too. In any event, his historical evidence and method is suspect. If you like Carville, you will like Schama."
4,Great book for K and 1st grade,"This book is well organized, which makes it easy to use. It took me less then a min. to find the pages I needed today. I would say the book is better for K-1. It would probably be too easy for anyone in 2nd grader."
5,The New Good Housekeeping,"Fabulous cookbook! Great recipes with detailed instructions. You don't have to be Jewish to love the food presented in the book. So many variations on the same theme, you'll be amazed. Every recipe I have made has been tried and true, a must for every kitchen. I aggree with other reviewers that the book makes for wonderful reading as well, history, stories, background, a real keeper!!"
5,"SO FAR I LOVE THE BOOK, I CAN'T WAIT TO FINISH IT","I love everything about the text, photos. I use do ballet, but I didn't know anything about it when I took ballet. So this book is showing and telling about it. Its defintly a keepsake for me and my kids, grandkids, and so on. Thank you."
3,It's worked so far. One tip broke though.,"The item was as desribed. One of the tips broke fairly easily, but the others are working fine so far. For the price, I am satisfied."
3,light weight use only,"Bought these a few months ago and just got around to using. Tried to remove and replace a ring in a car knuckle. Ended up bending part of pliers--although still useable. For under $10 I shouldn't have expected any other result. If you're thinking of buying these for any type of car maintenance, don't. Spend the extra $15-20 for something built for a mechanic to use everyday even if you use these infrequently.These are coming out of the garage tool box and going into the inside house repair tool box until garage sale time."
3,"For simple jobs, not for heavy duty","This tool is versatile. I do not like the case, it is very fragile, but to be a simple tool to work fine. I like to bring to the table where specifies the minimum and maximum size of the snap rings that can be removed. We often use the tools without knowing their tolerances and uses correct and this chart helps that does not happen"
3,"OK for the price, but for small jobs only.","The price is so low you can't really complain about the value. If you are doing snowmobile bearing replacement, though, these are not big enough for those clips. Also, there is no locking nubs on the pins so the clips can fly off pretty easy."
1,Worst quality: do not buy except for flimsy snap rings,"Like Linnea, I had a horrendous experience. On the first try, one of the tips broke off. The package I bought had an additional replacement for the straight ahead application, so I simply replaced it. The same result: on the first try, the tip broke off. I was attempting to remove the snap ring on my bicycle trainer hub, which is apparently equal to an industrial type snap ring. After two of them breaking on each of their first application, its obvious to me that a replacement would not have remedied the situation."
2,Not what I expected,"I bought this product thinking it was an external hard drive. I did not realize was ""Portable Enclosure"" meant in the description until I received it. Do not purchase this item expecting an external hard drive. It is very unclear as you purchase it. I opened the item and found an empty box and no hard drive. Please do not get confused and contact the seller if this item is what you are looking for."
5,Crunch Time Player,"In this pamphlet Dave Hudgens, former hitting instructor for the Oakland A's, outlines four of the most important attributes of a crunch time player:Mental Toughness,Concentration,Responsibilityand Goal Setting.A short chapter also outlines the ""Hitters Success Chain"" routine."
4,"Gorgeous music, horrid notes","The beauty of Mozart shines through this pair of quartets, which have been elegantly played and recorded on this CD. My daughters, who dote on the likes of ""N'Sync"", even ask me to play this! My only complaint is that the written notes accompanying the CD add nothing. I became interested in classical music recently through reading about the composers and their compositions. The fact that the notes for this CD were far below the usual Deutsche Grammaphon standard has left a sour aftertaste on this sweet recording."
5,Great learning story,Moves along well and has CD which makes it easier to grasp pronunciation. Fun Story from your childhood. Good phrases learned too.
4,Fifteen-year-old Mutter plays beyond her years,"Wolfgang Amadeus MozartConcertos for Violin and Orchestra -Violin Concertos Nos. 3 & 5Anne-Sophie Mutter - ViolinHerbert Von KarajanBerliner Philharmoniker(Deutsche Grammophon - ADD analog remastered - 1978)This is a very good performance. Mutter was young but skilled. Her lack of experience even helps, at times, to hear the piece instead of the interpretation but it is not always a help. This is of particular interest for those who have followed Mutter's career. This was recorded in analog but that does not hurt the enjoyment of this CD. This is a Four Star CD (4 )."
2,Pro Two-Way Shoe Stretcher,"They sent a men's size, so I sent it back. The second one came in a men's size also, so I kept it and It broke within a month."
1,Poorly designed and/or flawed unit broke,The internal cam screw that is suppose to force the halves apart when screwing did not hold and instead first ripped further up the wooden channel and then eventually sheered and broke.Very lame design using plastic for pressures that need steel. Avoid this one and look for another more durable product made with steel.
1,do not order this item from amazom,"product failed, poor quality. reordered from another supplier, received two (2) shoe streachers for the cost of one (1)) from amazon."
5,not sure,The stretcher arrived on time and seems to be what I wanted. I put it in shoes in question and then left on vacation so I am not sure how the stretcher worked...
1,Do you think I only have ONE Foot?,"HelloI order a shoe stretcher for my husband from another company (via Amazon) and we got 2, Left & Right...but WHY OH WHY did you only send ONE stretcher?And for the more MONEY than what we paid for the men's pair."
2,Not impressed,"Disappointed in these characteristics:1) Price for one is similar to others where you get 2.2) Device too narrow so when the screw is turned to widen, it does not stretch enough.3) The internal screw tip that spreads the halves wears in to the wood making it widen even less."
3,A Mixed Review,"I don't know why but I assumed shame on me that this was going to be a set of two !!!, Never the less the 1 shoe stretcher I received works well though I have to switch it between each shoe that I am stretching ). You really have to know what size you need and understand just how far a shoe can stretch !!I don't know if I would pay the same amount of money to get another one though."
1,"Terrible, terrible film!","I cannot believe the reviewers who claim this is a good and historically accurate film. Anyone who knows anything about what happened at Munich in 1972 will realize instantly that this film is a cheap dramatization designed to capitalize on interest in the recent terrorist attack at the Olympics. This film absolutely sucks. If you want the real story, read and then watch the book and film One Day In September. Even the scenes in Steven Spielberg's Munich get parts of the story wrong. Why? I have no idea. As if the real story wasn't dramatic enough that they had to change it."
1,Hoax or Blessing?,"A work hugely based on misconception, misinformation, and narrow mindedness...Last year american's had more office visits to chiropractors then to medical offices. Perhaps Mr. Chotkowski should have written: The non-emergency medical office visit the greatest hoax of the Century? Then we could have actually reviewed some pertinant health care critisisms."
1,Pure Garbage,"Tell Mrs. S that came into my office on 10/5/2000 using a walker due to sciatic pain running down her leg that chiropractic is a hoax. After one adjustment she walked out on her own accord with little residual discomfort. This is just one instance. Cases such as this are common in a chiopractic office. Many doctors of chiropractic became DC's because they themselves or family members had miraculous life-changing experiences associated with chiropractic.This guy doesn't have a clew about chiropractic or its benefits to humankind. I have many MD's and their families as patients. These people are well educated and understand chiropractic and its health benefits.Why does every state in the US and most countries license chiropractors if chiropractic was a hoax?Can the author disprove the subluxation?Dr. Herb Golden Naples, FL"
1,horrible reference,This author clearly doesn't not read scientific journals. You cannot base truth off of opinion. Did not have a wider audience of chiropractors to interview. Very biased opinion. Nothing factual.
1,Propaganda,"A chiropractor saved me from a back surgery...I'm now playing tennis. My daughter had severe asthma for the first 11 years of her life...she was on medication and using inhalers three times a day. I cant tell you how many times we rushed her to the hospital. Interestingly...after a course of chiropractic care her symptoms went away...she hasnt used an inhaler in 6 months...and no midnight hospital visits. My friend had severe migraines his whole life...usually about twice a month. They were totally debilitating yet after chiropractic care he has been migraine free for three years. I can go on and on...apparently chiropractic is quackory and these illnesses would have gone away by themselves. Wake up....chiropractic is a safe, valid, inexpensive form of health care. Just imagine...if the whole country was under chiropractic care, health care expenses would plummet.....might even put some medical doctors out of work...and that wouldnt be all bad."
1,Correction...,"I need to make a correction to an earlier submission. I inadvertently cited Kenneth Blum, Ph.D. as the biostatistician of the University of Miami School of Medicine who designed the study. I intended to list Robert Duncan, Ph.D., all else remaining the same. Kenneth Blum, Ph.D. is from the Department of Biological Sciences, University of Texas, and is credited with the discovery of the A1 allele D2 receptor gene anomoly. My apologies to anyone affected by this mix up."
3,NOT QUITE MAGIC TO ME,"AM I THE ONLY ONE WHO THINKS MS PETERS IS SLIGHTLY OFF KEY ON HER HIGH F PLACEMENT? THE REST OF THE CAST WAS GREAT....BUT CAN'T STAND PETERS EMOTIONLESS QUEEN OF NIGHT AND I DISLIKE HER TONE PERIOD. STICK WITH SUMI JO, LILY PONS, AND ADELINA PATTI"
1,"No CD, but diskette","The book offers several helpful forms, but the problem is that the book comes with a diskette and not a CD. Many updated computers do not come with diskettes anymore, but now come with CD-ROMs. The authors should think of updating to a third edition or allow readers to select either diskette or CD when purchasing."
2,Very disappointing order,I ordered this book with the understanding in the review that it was supposed to be in excellent shape. The book took almost 4 weeks to come and when it did it was in fair condition at best. It just looked old and worn and the cover had a small rip in it. Luckily it was for a friends 10 year old daughter who was just going to use the book to play school with and make notes in it anyway. And why did it have to take so long to get.....I guess they had to look for it in the attic!
3,Love the book but...,I love this book! I had a copy when I was little and wanted to have one for my kids now. I bought this book used and was expecting it to show some use. It was labeled as good condition but at best its fair. The binding is broken and its missing its jacket. I wish the sell had put these details in the description. I am going to keep it though $4 is an alright deal.
1,I READ YRS AGO AS CHILD,"AND I DIDNT GAIN ANYTHING FROM THIS BOOK. MAYBE IT'S SUFFICIENT FOR SOME KIDS TO FULFILL SCHOOL REQUIREMENTS, BUT NOW AS A YOUNG ADULT SEEING THIS BOOK IN OLD BOX, ITS CONTENTS FAIL TO REMEMBER...MAYBE I THINK AS ADULT OTHER QUALITIES OUTWEIGH THE VERSE, FOR EXAMPLE:VINE POUR EL CAMINO DEFICIL,LA LINEA QUE NUNCA TERMINA,LA LINEA QUE GOLPEA EN LA PIERDRA,LA PALABRA QUE ROMPRE UNA ESQUINA,MINIMA LINEA VACIA,LA LINEA, TODA UNA VIDA,PALABRA, PALABRA MIAPAULO LEMINSKI THIS IS POETRY MY FRIENDS!!!"
4,the laughing stock,"Hula eels, magic carpets and tickilish tom are all things in A Light in the Attic. This hilarios book has fun filled poems all over! such as Little Abigail and the beautiful pony. What happens to Abigail when she doesn't get what she wants?The author Shel Siverstein uses rymes through out the whole book to make it super funny. I would recomend this book if you like fantasy and magic. You will love these poems and be rolling on the floor laughing."
5,Who in their right mind does not like this book?,"If you have never read or had this read to you I feel bad for you. I am dyslexic and can barely make it thru a take out menu and I have read this book many times and plan on reading it to my son, very slowly and probably correcting myself a lot, so he can experience it for himself. Great book. Get off your ass and read it."
1,pool service,"i only got 2 issues 1 and half years ago, then it stopped, so I called Muse customer services twice, every time, they promised to make up the missing one, but I never get it. I am running out of energy of chasing after. Not worth of my money."
1,Not A-musing!,"Muse is terrible for 12 to 14 year olds. Instead, Discover (adult magazine), National Geographic, and Science News are wonderful magazines for this age group. If your child is bright, give him or her real reading material at the adult level. Don't waste your money--or your kid's time--on Muse."
1,"Subtle, but Unconvincing","Far gentler than most attacks on the LDS Church, but still, in its subtle way, an attack. I guess it's an improvement over most of its competition, though. (Which doesn't say much.)The stories and remembered conversations (recalled after decades have elapsed!) seem, not surprisingly, to be framed in such a way as to make Carol's Protestantism appear to best advantage, and, in several places, to make Mormonism look transparently foolish. This isn't the real world. Sorry."
2,Won't work with your heat pump.,"This thermostat, according to the Honeywell site, is for standard furnace/air conditioning setups. It won't work with your heatpump. For that you need the CT3600, which you can't buy from amazon (yet?)"
4,This book should come with a warning,"Do not read this book in a public place. Do not read this book when you are eating or drinking and certainly do not read this book if you have just got the children to sleep because they will wake up and want to know why you are laughing so much.It is one of the few books I have that can make me laugh out loud every time I read it. It is funny, sad, touching and firmly grounded in real life. I know the area where Deric lives and he is so true to life. Of all Deric Longden's books, this is my favourite."
4,This book was amazing!,"When I first heard this book was a classic I was like ""oh God this book is going to suck!"" But then I read it and I couldn't put it down! It's amazing!"
3,Weird but wonderful,"This book can only be described as phantasmagorical. It was written in 1939 but translated into English from the Yiddish in the 60s. It may be out of print, but worth getting your hands on a copy. It is about a little angel who is told it is time to descend to earth and become human. He is terrified of the send-off, which consists of getting smacked in the nose in order to forget all that is encountered in Eden, including knowledge of Torah. So the little angel, known as Shmuel-Aba, plays a trick by wearing a false nose, and so his real nose is spared. Consequently, he remembers all from the heavens and attempts to convey Ultimate Truths to those on earth.Like I said, this fantasy is weird, but it is written in an amusing, unconventional style, similar to an IB Singer book and is of that genre. Worth reading to expose oneself to this genre of secular Yiddish fantasists of yore - truly a lost legacy, for better or worse."
2,She has done better work,"This book is an enjoyable read if you have nothing better to do. I failed to be captivated by it. The characters lack the heartwrenching dramatic intensity that you find in her other works. Maybe it is because Alice Walker is such a phenominal author that people just expect so much from her. Still, this book is NOT making the cut for my personal library."
3,Good overall.,"I recently read Meridian for an AP American History term paper. The plot is difficult, at times, to follow. It goes back in forth from different times during Meridian Hill's, the main character, life. I also had a hard time figuring out who was who when I started reading the novel. After researching about the author, Alice Walker, for my school assignment, the book is a lot more interesting. It wasn't until I gained that knowledge, however, that I was able to comprehend and appreciate the novel. I recommend learning about the book before reading it."
3,Mountain Boy Double Kicksled,"The sled itself seemed OK other that it requires snow blades for snow that's not packed. The snow blades do not stay on the runners very well - the cause for the rating. When the item arrived the box was not in very good shape and consequently there were missing parts (screws, nuts and washers). Picked these up from Home Depot but is was aggravating. Not overly impressed with the product or the quality control of the company."
1,Simply didn't work,"Exciting day, setting up my new system. Finally, the cables arrived. I plugged in all my equipment, and....nothing. I did all kinds of troubleshooting (different HDMI ports, different settings, internet research about hardware), but nothing solved it. Eventually I just tried it with a different cable and it worked perfectly. This cable simply didn't work."
5,Don't let the low price fool you!,"The big box store sells 6 foot cables for $40...This cable is half the price and four times the length.Not a flimsy cable either, it's a nice solid product that works great.No loss of signal quality. Buy one! You won't be disappointed. Oh, and FAST shipping too!"
1,Bad cable,Picture not clear.All yellow lines. The picture quality is not reproduced on the tv. I suggest dont waste money on this product
5,Great Buy!,The HDMI cord performs exactly as I hoped it would. It's super long and is a perfect reach from my computer to my tv. What a cheap awesome way to be able to watch downloaded content on my 32 inch HD tv!
5,Excellent Cable,This cable works perfectly connecting my Dish satellite receiver to one of the HDMI inputs of my large-screen HDTV. Picture and sound are excellent.
1,It doesn't work to me!,"No image at all! I tried other short cable, and it works just fine.Be careful about this product!"
4,Works great.,"I received this and looked the cable over before running. Seems to be a good build with a nice thick sheilding. I ran into a bedroom 32"" samsung LCD from a PS3 in living room. Picture quality is great through movies and games. I would have given this a 5 star except my LCD will not do 1080P just 720P. I do not know if it will run 1080P, but I would have to guess it would and the image would look great."
2,ok for the money,"not very reliable, it did not work between my laptop and panasonic tv, but it worked with an old Olevia HDTV and it worked with a bluray..."
1,"Tried to give zero stars as the rating, but can't...","A one star rating is misleading and should be a zero.We purchased one of these cords and after a few days, the cord came apart. The metal on the end became lodged in our cable box and had to be yanked out with pliers. Thinking that maybe it was simply a defective cable we ordered another from the same place and the exact same thing happened! Obviously the price is appealing, but you are better off just throwing your money away than using this cable."
5,25 feet of High Definition Value!,Good cable for the money. Mine had the ferrite ends - becareful if you have tight clearances - they are molded into the cable and cannot be removed.
1,A tricky price...,"I bought the cable because of the good reviews. Unfortunatley for me the cable didn't work. It looked very well to me, a very thick and well done cable, but didnt work, no image at all! also the connector could be easyly pulled out, somehow it didnt stayed in its place so I will have to buy a new one because I live in Mexico and shipping is so expensive, it isnt worth to return it. Bad product. Maybe its the first bad experience with this cable, but be aware."
3,Sharp r-820 Black,"I bought this microwave because it has plenty of features, but I rarely use this as a toaster oven etc. I have been using this product for over 6 months now. I noticed that it takes too long to heat up products. This microwave has a problem. The revolving plate inside the unit needs to be higher. If you are trying to warm a dish with low height, it just takes too long. I then inverted a dinner plate on this revolving plate to increase the height and this seems to fix the problem."
3,Pie Plate Popcorn and Coffee -- It's a Convection Oven Too,"Adequate. To pop popcorn efficiently requires we insert a glass pie plate upside down--so the bag of popcorn is about an inch above the turntable--otherwise only about half pops. A cup of coffee also reheats better on the pie plate. Do I like the pie plate on the turntable routine? Well it is better on the turntable than setting on the counter waiting for the next time we want popcorn. The heighth of the cooking area is a little short for some larger items--even when the pie plate is out of the oven. We got it as a micro wave, and see no reason to get it dirty by cooking since it does not look easy to clean so I can not speak to things like baked on spatters or cleaning--maybe clean up is its strong point. We probably just bought the wrong product since we needed a small microwave to fit a built in slot and the convection feature seemed like a nice add-on. I hope it lasts forever."
5,crispy baquettes!,Great convection microwave. The screen is a little difficult to read at times...but who really needs another clock in the kitchen anyways? Preheat time is a little lengthy. Patience is key. This product is great for heating just about any food.
5,The Perfect Appliance for a Single Person,"I ""blew up"" my microwave by forgetting to push ""timer"" before setting the time, and the gas oven in my little mobile home has never worked. My toaster oven is too small to bake much, and my mom has always sworn that her convection oven was the greatest. When I found this Microwave/Convection oven, I decided it was worth trying, in spite of some reviews that left me wondering. And it was on sale with free shipping! I am very satisfied with it. I tried using the package instructions when baking a frozen pizza and cremated it. The next time, I used the programmed setting and it came out great. I've done casseroles, bread, cookies, lots of microwave functions, but not the roast feature yet. Yes, the display doesn't show well when viewed from an angle, but that's no big deal. I had no loose parts on mine, and everything is great."
1,Do Not Purchase,After only two weeks using it is broken and in the shop for 8 days!I would return it but was told they will not accept the return.$239 for nothing!It is also very noisy!Do not purchase an appliance online.
2,Short lived,"This was a fantastic albiet bulky unit while it worked. It had tons of functions and worked great, however, it shorted out, began smoking, and tripped my GFCI outlet only 19 months after I bought it. It's a shame really as I liked the unit, but for $200 I expected it to last a bit longer."
5,Another glowing review,"Can't add much except that it works beautifully and the baking functions are superb. I've done 2 different yeast breads and they are beautiful. The reheating functions are also great and for once, I can defrost meat without partially cooking it around the edges! Worth the money. The first reviewer is DEFINITELY right!"
4,Pleasantly Surprised!,"We zipped up to our Mountain Cabin and plugged in this dandy convection oven/microwave. Our guests arrived and we hoped we could really brown bread and bake. IT WORKED! - Like a charm. We nuked cold coffee in the morning too. All, with only a cursory glance at the manual. For our needs, it is perfect."
2,Not Really Worth It,"Someone else wrote ""Bleck"" in a review...I couldn't have said it better. For a book that both moved relatively quickly and generally kept my interest, I couldn't help but finish it a feel like having wasted my time. The first chapter alone is full of inconsistencies and then shortly thereafter the main ""hero"" gets ""innocent"" Caro into bed by getting her drunk. Great. I can't believe that I could actually like nearly all the characters except the main two. Even if steamy romance is your thing, this wasn't worth the read."
4,Solid Reference Book,I used the newer 2nd edition of this book for my undergradute Sedimentary/Stratigraphy class. It proved to be very readable while still providing a good base of knowledge. My professor stated that little was changed from the earlier 1st edition so I purchased this copy as a reference book for my collection. Tremedous book for the price.
3,Lacks something...,"I had great anticipation going into this book, what I found, however, was disappointment. While I liked the main `heroine', Charlotte, who felt to me like she had real fears and beliefs. I found that Roman was not as likeable. He seemed flat without any realistic characteristics. Throughout the book, although there were ups, there were also downs. Their whole relationship in the book seemed based more on a physical plane than on love or substance. It never really felt like a real relationship.As for the other characters, they were all delightful and enjoyable, especially the owners of the diner, the town vagrant, and Beth. Not to mention the Chandler brothers' mother and her `beau'. I was hoping Beth would be a main character in either one of the next books in the trilogy or have her own book. It appears that won't happen, but you never know.While it was enjoyable at times, and I'm sure others will love it, I found it lacking for me."
1,Just Too Boring...,"This book had so much potential but unfortunately it fell flat early on and never recovered. Even some of the 'lingo' sounded ridiculous. I don't know of too many men who call their friends, pal. Dude, maybe.There was just nothing interesting to keep this thing going. Roman was actually a great character as was Charlotte. It's too bad their story didn't shine."
5,THIS IS THE GREAT BERNSTEIN,"When Leonard Bernstein tried to be a ""serious"" composer, the results were only pretentious. When he wrote ""light"" music, the results were wonderful and original. In Candide, he is really the great composer Leonard Bernstein. And the great conductor too - he and his cast are unbeatable. I don't care what the Broadway standards are for length of a musical, all the music in this cds is valuable, belongs to the piece and should be heard every time this show is given."
4,Replace Anderson,"I bought this disc especially for the final piece ""make our garden grow."" Due to the death of a family Siberian Husky, my dad began to plant a small garden of wild flowers upon which we will spread some of her ashes. I wanted to put together a cd for my parents and brother that I felt characterized our beloved dog. Anyway, I heard this finale done on TV at a Richard Tucker gala and very much enjoyed it. However, I am terribly disappointed in June Anderson's wobbly, wiry singing. AND, it was the text that I really was looking for to fill the bill, but you can't understand any of it! It's like Joan Sutherland on a really bad mush mouth day, but without her beautiful voice and warmth of tone. Thus, Make Our Garden Grow sounds more like ""mee mow arin oh"" Damnit!The rest of the cast is great and I very much enjoy the work. Anderson is the debit."
4,It's great!,"My wife and I love medical suspense and we couldn't put it down. Dr. Metcalf, an epidemiologist, returned home when his cousin wrote to him about an epidemic in his home on Lobster Island; and Dr. Tansy Whitmore (his ex-lover) stubornly follows. Then, trying to save the lifes of their patients, and running for their lifes; they'll need to find the killer and prevent him from contaminating the main source of the Island's water."
4,"Which ""lip plumper"" is which?","When I ordered this I believe I confused it with ""Lip Enhancer,"" that a friend of mine who is a skin expert uses when doing facials. This product did not perform as that product did-- which was the best I ever used. However, this product offered clear, pink and red, and has above average ingredients in it, and it performs satisfactorily. It costs less than some of the top lip ""collagen"" products that run $39.99 for one lipstick. It's above average, there a lot of products that perform worse and are of less quality ingredients and texture, but there are a few products that are superior out there too. This is a good value for what you get."
2,Kissinger? Really?,I had casual acquaintance with this guy. He was a trip. Looking for communist Chinese owning golf courses in New Hampshire...Talleyrand was shite in silk breeches according to Napoleon...He had a point!
4,The Incredible Shrinking Comics!,"I will not repeat the many well-written reviews here concerning the content of the books. But the formatting and editing of this new issue of 3-in-1 stories bears mention:1. Herge himself revised these works several times since their original publication, so some frames may have been altered as a result. This was especially true in stories like ""Congo"".2. Like comics and graphic novels worldwide, the books have been attacked by the shrinkers, who apparently believe we don't care what size the images are in, so long as we can read the text. This is a real shame, as it is the compelling large-format incredibly and accurately detailed images that made the Tintin stories so fun to read to begin with.All that being said, you'll enjoy this nostalgia trip down memory lane. But after reading them once, you may end up selling them on Amazon.... I probably will sell my set here."
5,its a very useful book,It explains you in a very clear way what to do with your money. I find it a very smart book.
5,Suze Orman Owning the Power to Control Your Destiny,This is a great book. I am still reading it. It is very practical and very structured. I am feeling more empowerd and motivated to make the changes I need to make.
2,Fundamentals,"I was not impressed with this book. I felt like she was writing to woman 20 years ago. It was way too basic, like get your own checking account. I would like to see something more in depth like her previous books but geared for women."
3,Not Happy With the Layout of the Book,"I LOVED Suze's previous book for the Young Fabulous and Broke. I loved the layout of that book because it was pretty straightforward. Do this. THEN do this. And then this. And then THIS. The new book, Women and Money, rambled on and on and on and on so much in the first few chapters about women in the workforce and all this stuff I really could care less about. I work. I am in the workforce. Yes. I get paid. I need to know HOW to maximize my money, not be given a history lesson about how women have come a long way in the corporate world and anecdotes about her life and her friends lives. Granted there IS some good information in here, but if you're a young woman in your 20's or 30's and need straightforward and direct financial advice that relates to YOUR situation, pick up The Money Book for the Young, Fabulous and Broke instead of this one."
1,It may say 100 Watts...,...but don't believe it! I received this as an XMAS present and was sorely disappointed. It simply does not put out anything close to the claimed luminosity. On another nearby desk I have a 50W halogen light that's easily twice as bright. Checked the bulb and it indeed was labeled as 100W. Don't know what the reason is... power supply... bad design? Regardless... get ready for something more like 25W... I sent mine back.
2,"Pleasant John Denver Performances - But NOT The Originals Of His ""Best""","One thing you have to be wary of whenever you see a volume from Madacy, based in St. Laurent, Quebec, Canada is that, more often than not, what they are presenting as someone's ""best"" is actually re-recordings of some of their biggest hits. This one, despite the connection to EMI-Capitol, is no exception. It was recorded at 16th Avenue Sound in Nashville the year before his untimely death on October 12, 1997 at age 53 in an airplane accident.So, don't expect to hear Placido Domingo on the 1982 hit Perhaps Love (or even the John Denver solo version from his 1982 LP Seasons Of The Heart), or Sylvie Vartan on the 1984 hit Love Again. Nor do Fat City (Bill Danoff and Terry Nivert) of The Starland Express Band back him on Take Me Home Country Roads.Not horrible recordings by any means - but these types of CDs need to be better advertised as re-makes, especially if ordering on-line as there you never get to see the ""fine print."""
4,"Better than ""Greatest Hits"".","Not only is this his best single disc collection, but it's a good price also. This has three more songs than the ""Greatest Hits"" has, and includes ""Annie's Song"" and ""Thank God I'm A Country Boy"", which the other doesn't. Those are must have songs in my opinion. He does have a couple 2-disc sets out, but those are too much for me. Just like ""John Mellencamp"" can transport you to a small town in Indiana, I think you'll find yourself high in the Colorado Rockies with this cd."
4,great cd for new age music lovers,"this is a great colleccion of music, if you buy this one you problably buy some o the others from this set"
1,"AWFUL, MOVIES GOOD.......... GAMES BAD!",What happend to this game it tis horrendous! Every level is repetitive and boring here is a mini review(BASED ON A SCALE OF 1-5)!Sound:1-All Music Sounds The SameGraphics:3-Good only when the movies come on or else awful!I dont even have to tell you the rest to persuade you not to buy this right....This game is awful so when you see this game to a cry at how bad it is. Do a Charlies Angel Formation and chop this game up into shreds!Please STOP making this game for the bettter of the world!
5,aaron copland recording,"An excellent recording of Copland, conducted by the conductor who knew and appreciated his music best. The supplier was prompt."
4,Good book,"Nice selection of songs, intermediate level, the voice line is nicely incorporated in the piano line so you get very close sound to the original."
3,"naja, ein anfang zu besserem","naja, so langsam wird's wohl mit den jungs... nachdem passablem ""junimond""-cover von rio reiser folgt die bands wohl endlich ihrer inneren stimme und fängt an, musik zu machen; haben wohl jetzt den finanziellen backround dafür ;) eigentlich ein sehr einfach gestricktes liedchen mit einem ""5 minuten auf dem klo rausgedrücktem"" text, aber der slomo-teil mit der trompete ist ein kleiner -wenn auch alter- netter einfall. naja, vielleicht kommt ja eines tages der moment, wo auch ich in den plattenladen gehen kann und nicht erst 40 girlies zur seite schaufeln muss, um eine ""echt""-cd zu kaufen.glück auf, der steiger kommt...hushigushi"
4,Mahogany step stool,The stool is excellent quality - looks good and works well. The surprise is the weight - very heavy.
5,Very well made,The item looks better in person. We planned on using it in the closet. After seeing the ladder we want to display it.
5,Great Product,This is a very well made step stool and is very stable. You feel secure climbing up to your desired height. I recommend this item to anyone who is looking for a wooden step stool.
1,Attractive but fragile,"I ordered this ladder originaly becuase of it's appearance. When it arrived the handle was shattered in shipping. The system of correspondence with the vendor was time comsuming and cumbersome, It took me over a week to get a return authorization, and then I had to pay to return the ladder myself! After complaining they did refund the cost of shipping. I ordered a replacement, and it also came cracked. Again the cumbersome process of communication. This time they did pay for the return of the product. I did not order another one. Too much hassle."
2,Not as expected.,"Yes, this Step Stool works. Yes, it is wood with a mahogany stain. No, it does not have silver colored rivets. We wanted the ""stainless"" style rivets. Also, the packaging allowed the vertical rail to get dented in transit."
2,not what expected,"when you buy incense, i expected the longer sticks. these are not even 6 inches long and are brittle. no value"
1,couldn't get it to work,"I ended up with 2 copies of this CD and neither would work on my very new computer. I took one to the company that built my computer and it wouldn't work on either their work computer or the computer tech's home computer. Actually, most of it works, but the videos of dinosaurs sound like a skipping record and the audio is unintelligible. Anyhow, I contacted the company that puts these out and they acted like they had never heard of the problem before and had not solutions except that my computer (and apparently the two other computers that tried to play this CD) were somehow faulty. This would have been a good purchase if it had worked correctly."
2,Not inspiring,"Non inspiring, lacking messsages of insight and hope as one would expect from the title and from such a renouned researcher as Jane Goodall with years of experience working from the ground up in a field so many can only dream of doing."
3,"Laggy, draggy Bernstein can't match his youth","I try to buy all Bernstein recordings, and this one, his digital remaake of some veyr famous early recordings, is slow, inflated, and jost not anywhere near a match for the hip, Jazzy Bernstein that sprang on the scene and single-handedly revitalized classic music in America. Maybe worth owning as a legacy recording, but missalbe otherwise."
5,A lot of good information - even for the novice hunter,"In spite of being a beginning hunter, I found this book to be a good resource. Many illustrations, and discussion on basic technique. (Of course, a major focus of the book is how to bag that trophy buck, so most discussions tend in that direction.) I've found there are two types of hunting books, stories and ""how to do it"". This book is in the latter category and is what I was looking for. How to: Still hunt, stand hunt, track in the snow, reduce scent, scout, etc. I first checked it out from our library, and now I'm getting a copy for my own."
1,Not What I Anticipated,"After reading all the great reviews, I purchased this book but neither the pictures nor the content was interesting. I basically wasted the money on something I will not be looking at again. I wanted to see the great illustrations as references and all I saw was some old time drawings. Not what I anticipated."
3,Loses something in translation,"The liner notes readily admits that these pieces were originally written for harpsichord. The piano tends to mellow out the crisp, high ""tinginess"" so something is lost in translation. Good selections though."
3,A fun game that can be hard on the eyes.,"Parts of this game are pretty cool as far as the futuristic and colorful graphics, along with some good sound effects. It's too bad they didn't seem to finish the sound effects part, as some are obviously missing. The game is shaky sometimes and the camera angles are awful."
3,I waited 4 years for this game and I'm disappointed!,I bought this game the day it came out and put it on and after going through all of the boards I have to say I am disappointed.I love CTR and I thought this would be an updated (graphic wise) of the game. Some of the weird weapons are just weird. The green protective shield - you can't shoot it at anyone like before. I hate when the wheels turn and cling to the ground - it feels like you're not even moving. You shouldn't have to power slide through the whole game in order to get some speed. I think there is too much detail in order to keep your attention to the actual race. I loved the snow boards on CTR and the 1 snow board on this game I don't like at all. Too many dips and and the snow coming down is annoying. I never thought they would make another one and when I found out they were I was counting down the days till I could get my hands on it. It's ashame Naughty Dog didn't make this one. What were they thinking!
3,Too Confusing to be a good Introduction,"This book was good - the author is obviously a great thinker, and he manages to weave together many philosophical concepts to form a good narrative. I think, however, that through his desire to use an engaging style, he instead confuses the reader who has never been introduced to Philosophy of Mind before. Not the best book for the beginner student."
1,very dissatisified,The description did not mention that this recording was not by original artists - then I find out I can not return unless it was unopened. I will not by from this seller again. If I wanted to hear songs sung by unknowns - I would go to a Karoke bar.
2,A beach book,Take this book to a beach or a pool and read it there while drinking your favorite concoction. Don't expect a super story or a paramount love story but the story is not out of reality. I don't like very much these kind of books because I think they don't have anything to really hitch you in the plot.
3,"why put ""advantage"" on the cover?","Author does a decent job describing features of an introvert, including some hard to get through brain charts. However despite of numerous (and pretty annoying) ""there's nothing wrong with you"" notes, this text reads like a conviction. Author makes introverts condition in the society look prett bad, as if they were someones seeking immediate help. Especially spectacular is the part with advice on returning merchandise to a store. So why put ""Advantage"" on the cover?"
5,Excellent Read,"Thank you for having this available for the Kindle, it was easy to download, and it an excellent read. Look forward to completing it."
3,Boring,"I know it's not supposed to be an exciting read, but the author repeats the same terms to death. It's informational, but kind of long and drawn out with a lot of filler in between. I didn't finish reading it."
2,Warning! May contain traces of usefull information.,"I had high hopes for this book. Sadly it didn't live up to them.All the usefull information in this book could have been summed up in a well written 5 page paper. However it wasn't. Instead you get 330 pages full of ""There is nothing wrong with you... no really, I get that too"" which just proves that someone as weird as ""you"" can write a book and not much else.The first 50 or so pages are usefull once you learn to dodge the overload of compassion. It will tell you a thing or two about the inner workings of the introvert / extravert brain and from this you can learn valuable lessons on how to lead your life. Stop reading there. Once you get the point, close the book and open your mind. Have a nice long think and experiment a little.Should you decide to read on, you will be told that ""nothing is wrong with you"" so often that you start to believe the opposite."
4,Mixed Reviews,"I personally have not seen this yet, but hope to get my hands on one of these videos! The mixed reviews I have heard are from friends of mine who have either seen it or were a part of it. This movie was filmed on location in Roswell, NM at the New Mexico Military Institute(NMMI). I am an alum of the 'Tute and though was not attending while this was filmed, I can attest that it was filmed with actual cadets as extras and on the campus of an actual military school. NMMI was created in 1891 in the New Mexico Territory and has been a pivotal institution in Western United States history. Many officers of our nations military has graduated from there. Some celebrities have also attended there; Roger Staubach, Owen Wilson, etc. It continues today as a 4 year high school, 2 year junior college military boarding school that has a top notch education curriculum and continues to produce high caliber leaders and innovators."
2,"The word is ""generic""","I don't regret reading this, but then again I'm never doing so again. Very standard Monkey's Paw plot, strictly by the numbers. Some okay character work, although the one most focused on(Hellion) is easily the most cardboard-cutout and least interesting to me. The art is competent and helps the story flow but seems almost too focused on that purpose: there's no real sense of style, or action to it."
2,Bought and returned,"I bought this because I really liked the way it looked. When I finally received it, it was flimsy, cheaply made, and hard to see the time. Now if it was $15 it might be a good deal, but not for the $40 that I paid. Sent it back the next day."
2,"Flimsy, stopped working after a few weeks.","Flimsy, cheap feel. Looks nice, but that's about it. The clock stopped working after a few days, stuck on 2:20 even with 2 different brand new batteries. The pendulum still works, but can't tell time from that.Just filed for a return. Hopefully Wrappable will accept it."
2,LOOKS GOOD IN THE ADD,THE OIL LAMP LOOKED BETTER IN THE ADD!! CHEESEY CONSTRUCTION CHEAP MATERIALS. SAVE YOUR MONEY MAYBE I'AM EXPECTING TOO MUCH FOR $20.00 A LAMP?
2,blue glass not transparent,"I ordered two Glo Brite Oil Lamps, one green and one blue. The green base is transparent, as seen in the photo. The blue is nearly opaque, unlike the photo. Unfortunately, the blue font is not as attractive as the green."
2,"I went in with high hopes, but......","Wow, I never walk out of a movie, and I hate to give up on a game half way thru, but I came very close here. The original Fallout was the first RPG I'd ever owned, and I still love it, its sequel, and tactics; I really wanted to like this one to, but I just couldn't wait for it to end. I almost bought it the day it came out for full price, thank goodness I held off and and just picked it up for under ten. As it is, rumor has it an open ended Morrowind style RPG is being worked for the next Gen consoles a couple years from now, which I am sure will be great.....but just incase, I'll be waiting before picking it up. Sorry Interplay, but this long time fan just doesn't trust you anymore (but wants to be won back)"
5,Men and Poetry?,"Not for the faint of heart, but also not for the ignorant. Read this book at your own risk - it will inspire change beyond imagination."
4,mystically beautiful,"I have only given this recording four stars, because the recording itself is not the best. For the most part it is very good, however the sopranos tend to sharp miserably in the big Forte chorale sections, and the balance between the different choirs, and between the choirs and orchestra leaves something to be desired. This is the first Goldenthal recording I have ever heard, and I was blown away. It constantly teaters between sometimes less than beautiful A-tonality and passionate beautiful sound. The rythmic conventions employed by Goldenthal in the second movement are extremely effective, and moving. This is an incredibly powerful piece of music, that leaves me in awe after every listening. This recording is well worth the money, you will not be dissapointed."
4,Chicago 7-County Street Guide,"I moved out of Chicago in 1969. When I found out I was to return for a week I figured things had changed a bit (especially my memory). I was right on both counts but the street guide never failed me. In all honesty, I would have rated it a 5 if the text had been a bit bigger for my ""senior"" eyes. However, all maps are a compromise of some sort and larger text would have made the 7 counties unusable in a modern car."
2,Hard to walk in,"i like the shoes but there verry hard to walk in, if you want sore feet & your back hurting then get them but i would not buy these shoes ever again. there just not comfy on my feet.Crystal"
5,So glad I had this- recommend to all moms!,"This is a great product. It made my life so much easier. I used a 6-gate kit with 2 extra, and I think you really need those to get good space- those two extra really expand the area. I used mine in a big rectangle in a corner, so maybe that made mine sturdier, but I never had any issues with kids getting out or pushing it around. I put all the baby toys in there, keeping the rest of my house neater. I wish I would have had this with my previous kids because it really helped me out when I am too busy to watch everything a baby is sticking in their mouth. My kids never liked a tiny playpen, but these are much roomier. I highly recommend getting this!"
4,Its ok for now,This was a little difficult for my husband and I to put together but we managed finally. We have a small living room and it takes up quite a chunk of space. Its great for putting all baby's toys in one area. My problem is that my seven month old is now pulling herself up to stand and can push on the walls and move it on the wood floor. I'm pretty sure she will soon be able to move it a lot further across the room. The thick play mats underneath have helped keep it in one place for now at least. I would've liked to see some kind of door on it - a little hard on the back to reach in and get baby out if baby's in the middle. Yes I realize I could step over it but I have short legs and definitely not as nimble as I used to be. Would also like it if it came in different colors so it didn't look so much like a dog kennel.
1,Very disappointing,"We were very excited and eagerly waiting for this once we had ordered it. We went by the wonderful reviews that it had received and thought it would be perfect for our 8 month old. But we were very disappointed with the product. It is so hard to close and open, that it's not practical at all. I'm surprised that it's got such good reviews. We definitely don't recommend this product - don't waste your time / money / energy. Thank God for returns. Now we're on the look out for a play yard that actually works."
4,Most have,Not cheep but worth it. It's customizable and very versatile. I purchased two and am able make a half circle around our big couch. I'm able to be with my very active son while giving him the freedom he needs while not having to chase him down every min.
3,Does its job.,"The playpen is great to keep our puppy in training enclosed while not being watched but it is quite hard to open and close; you need to put a lot of pressure/strength to do so. If you are planning to not openning and closing it that often then it is perfect for you, otherwise it becomes a burden to use it."
3,Good product with one flaw,"I must admit my first choice was the `Summer Infant Secure Surround Gate' but it been out of stock and we need something asap. The gate is very steady but I really wish they made a door panel, and then it would be ideal. For the price it works"
5,Love it!,We have a large living room and wide multiple doorways so this is the perfect way to keep our little one safe. Much better than getting a bunch of gates which our older son would be unable to open. Love it and I'm so happy with the price $51 and delivered free to my front door. You can't beat that! I love Amazon!
4,North States Superyard Classic XT Play Yard,This product is a life saver! We have two Morkie puppies and they are small and run around a lot and hide under everything. The play yard helps keep them secure and contain them inside or outside. The puppies still run and play safely inside this play yard all they want. :)
5,I love it!,I ordered this play yard because it could be used as a fence. I wanted to block off our Christmas tree from our 16 month old and it worked perfectly. Our tree stood proudly untouched and undamaged. Our daughter was able to admire the tree but not break anything or hurt herslef. I highly recommend it! I plan to use it to block off the electronic equipment in the family room since it worked so well.
5,Great Item!,"This Play Yard works perfectly for our new Maltese puppy. He has plenty of room in it during the day while we are at work. He is way too little to worry about him getting out. We leave it open when we are home and he goes in and out as needed. He lays in his bed, eats, or drinks when he feels like it. We looked at stores for a play yard and none were as big or inexpensive as this one. Great product!"
4,"Works great, but a little flimsy","It's a great product, plenty big with the 6 panels, folds up for storage. My concern is about folding it up too much, the plastic seems flimsy, and gives a lot. For the Amazon price I'm okay with it, but no way would I pay what my local stores were charging for it, it would seem like a cheap rip off at those prices."
4,Works,We are able to block off our kitchen and she able to roam freely in our living room without worry....great priduck
4,Good item,After much research I decided to go with the superyard. I have to agree with the other reviews that it definitely can be pushed around by 11 month daughter but it does make me feel better if I can take my eyes off her for just a few seconds if I'm in the kitchen and know that she's safe inside. Adjusting the shape of the playard is not easy and have chosen to leave it set up in a room rather than breaking it down and assembling it as I need it.
4,Affordable and practical,"My wife and I bought this product for our 8 month old son, who regardless of how much we baby proof still manages to get into everything. It wasn't expensive at all compared to similar products. Our son is a big boy (24 lbs 26 inches long), and we were afraid that he would hurt himself by pulling up on it, but it seems to stand just fine with his weight. WE needed the peace of mind knowing that he wouldn't get into something dangerous while we were washing bottles, cooking dinner, cleaning house, ect... We're so happy we bought this, you wont be disappointed!"
3,Superyard isn't THAT super....,"This gate works pretty well, except my baby can still pull it down when I'm using it as a gate instead of an enclosure. I had it around the Christmas tree and couldn't latch the gate together. When it is an enclosure, it is a bit small. My baby is 14 months old and cries the whole time he's in it. I would recommend buying the additional gate to add, I haven't done that yet, but plan on it. Overall, this gate comes in handy in situations where you HAVE to block your baby out, but if you want to do something leasurly and think your baby will sit in there and play happily, it is not for that."
5,Grandma's review,"This Superyard play yard for little ones was easy to put together, easy to shift into shape to fit a corner, and it looks good. The diamond shapes keep it from looking like a little prison. The size and height is good for a crawler to move around and to keep thrown toys inside. He can pull himself up on the sides and it stays stable. I can set it up in a spot where he can see everyone as we move around between the living room dining area and kitchen, then fold it a little and slide it to another spot. I may get the additional two panels to enlarge it, but it is working just fine right now. This a great, safe containment for a crawler."
3,Does what it supposed to - mostly,"I bought this gate so I could bend it and put it around our tv area. The kids were getting into the VCR and DVD player too much. It worked for a while, until my then 17 month old learned how to tip it over. He also learned that he could move one corner out of the way and slip behind it too still reach the tv. I've anchored it to the wall and it works that way, otherwise it is a little flimsy and easy to tip. It's not too pretty either."
3,Ok at first,"This play yard was great at first. I have a 14 month old and I got it for here when she was about 8 months. My daught was walkin at 8 months and as a work-from-home mom, sometimes it was tough to be on the phone and running around the house with her. She loved it, played with her toys and I would put a pillow in there so when she was sleepy, she can go to sleep. I would even be able to pop a video in and she would sit at watch and i felt comfortable leaving her in the roomDONWFALLS- she was able to push the playard down the hallway and get it stuck. She was also able to push it around to manipulate the shape and at one point was making it into a skinny little thing. Other down fall SHE CAN CLIMB OUT OF IT. Because of the little holes in it, she got her little toes in them and climbed out. I was sitting in my office and I heard little patter of feet coming down the hallway. I looked and there she was in my doorway smiling"
5,Panel,"The panels helped to expand the pen for my puppies to help monitor them while outside. It's easy to set up, move and store!"
4,It's good for the price,"This gate does exactly what you need. It can gate your kids into a baby proofed area so that you can get things done around the house. Other good use? Gating off exercise equipment or tv area. But it's not easy to fold and unfold and is annoying to do twice a day (once to get out once to put away). My house isn't big enough to leave it out assembles unfortunately. It was really hard to set up in front of the TV, it took me a half an hour. I decided never to do it again because it was so hard.In a nut shell - If you have a bigger house, this is perfect! If not, consider just baby proofing a whole room for your tot."
4,Great for containing an area,I love this for keeping my plants off limits to my 10-month old son. I live in a small apartment and have a lot of plants. I had a hard time figuring out what to do to keep them out of reach once he started moving around more. This works great! I keep the gate around my plants so my son can't get to them. An added bonus is it keeps my cat out of the plants as well. Even once we move to a house I can see using this either inside or outside to contain different areas.
4,Superyard,"I have not used it yet, it is for my grandaughter to play in on a camping trip. We bought it so she could be confined and safe. It is exactly what we were looking for."
5,great for containing chicks,I bought this product and the extension kit to contain my chicks in a smaller area. It works very well until they fly then I had to cover it. Love how it folds up accordian style and is easy to put away. I'll be taking it to my in-laws to put in front of their fireplace for safety this year. worth my money
2,Too difficult to open,We have used this for our new puppy when we travel and it is effective. Stores easily and is lightweight and compact. My complaint is the ease of setting it up - it sucks! The detects in the panel connectors require manly strength to open and close - very frustrating!
4,"Works for corralling active, adventurous 14-month-old boy","It isn't pretty, but it works to keep my 14-month-old son safe at times when I really need him to be contained. My guy is pretty active, but I did not have any problems with him pushing the play yard over or around even though he was standing and leaning on it. We have it on an area rug. I don't use it for long periods, so the standard size worked just fine for us."
2,How To Institutionalize Your Baby,"Yes, this product pens in your kid and does it well. However, it's a grey industrial looking hunk of plastic that far too resembles a prison cell for my taste. Hell, it's even made by a company called ""North State"". It even sounds like a prison.Maybe if they bothered to offer it in colors other then grey and white."
2,Not for you,"This item would work well if your child is in the crawling stage. However, if your child is walking then this is not for them. My son is able to push the gate where he wants it. And because it is so light he is also able to pick it up and escape."
4,Superyard XT,"Good product for containing small or ""toy breed"" puppies. If using it outdoors, I would recommend the expansion panels. I use it to contain two chihuahuas outdoors while I mow the lawn. Would not recommend using it for extended periods of time as it is a rather small space. I am happy with this purchase. By the way, it is made in Wisconsin. I would buy it again."
2,Hard to open!,"I purchased this gate based upon the great reviews. I unfortunately had the opposite experience. I found that the gate was very difficult to open, just as difficult to close, and the gate also has to be placed in a certain position so that it wont tip. My mom pointed out that one of the gates was cracked on top. Most likely from the force required to open and close. I am returning this gate immediately."
4,Exactly what I was expecting,This product was exactly what I was expecting and was half the cost on Amazon as compared to the local pet super chain.
4,Good gate,"This is a good baby gate. I'm 5'1 so it's a little tough for me to climb over, but for anyone taller it should be a cinch. My only complaint is that if you want it to be stretched out from wall to wall, you have to drill it into the wall because it's meant to be completely attached."
2,A VERY SMALL ONE...,When i bought this ..i thought this would be little spacier ..but seems to be a very small one ..you definitely need two of them to give some room for your kid to roam around otherwise within minute they will get bored and start cranking . Also not so stable on carpets ...if your baby leans on it ..it comes down a bit. So your baby is scared sometimes of the movement in the frames.
4,great for puppies,This has worked great with our three pups.The only thing I really didn't like was tryingto snap the pieces into place but if you have twopeople it works great. I would recommend gettingtwo and putting them together!!
1,Read reviews before purchasing.,"I knew the price was too good to be true. This is only a symphony recording of Sinatra's music. Not the real thing. I would recomend to anyone, not to buy this one, and check the reviews first."
1,"Snookered - my own fault, Best of Frank Sinatra!","One would have to go in pretty deep to find that these CD's were done in Riga, Latvia and are instrumentals only with nary a sound of Frank Sinatra. My own fault!!"
3,I cannot recommend all of staffs.,"It is well-organized.Beginning practice is excessively useful. Also, Listening, Speaking, and Writing practice are helpful.(If you wanna practice Listening, you have to buy extra audio CDs... but it surely is helpful. It contains different types of accent such as British, Australian.)However, as for reading practice, I cannot recommend this 'cause it's totally different from real the iBT TOEFL test. I cannot accept this book's practice style.In conclusion, people who want to improve;1) Listening2) Speaking3) Writing(including Grammer practice)this book helps you."
3,Informative but too general,"I like the book by Keddie, but she has stopped short talking about Iran's role in international terrorism. She has devoted only three paragraphs about Islamic Republic's actions in terrorising most of the world. She also says that Iranians believe this myth that the United States under Carter's Administration brought the revolution to Iran. This is not a myth Prof. Keddie, the Carter administration with the help of its Europeans allies brought Khomeini to Iran. Today we are witnessing the same compliance and appeasment by former national security advisor to Carter. Please be little more accurate and try to present reality as it appears."
1,"4 film favorites: Space jam, Looney Tunes Back in Action/Funky Monkey and Osmosis Jones","4 Film Favorites: Space Jam, Looney Tunes Back In Action/Funky Monkey and Osmosis JonesOnly one star for the quick shipment, unfortunately this collection did not include a disc for Space Jam, it only included two copies of Osmosis Jones/Funky Monkey!"
3,gets duller by chapter,"The first hundred odd pages are very, very good, on the founding of Morgan by Peabody and later into the interesting and dramatic career of the robber baron's banker, Pierpont Morgan, a fascinating study.However, that still leaves six hundred more odd pages, of whichI struggled to finish, like an Ironman contestant with a willpower problem, having read about two or six other books in the meantime. Perhaps the fault is with me, as few other reviewers seem to have this problem. However if you aren't Ron Chernow's cousin or professionally interested in JPMorgan then your incentives to finish this brick diminish chapter by chapter, as the narrative, whilst sorta interesting in its own ""that was a politically influential loan, Joe was a different style leader to Jack"" type way, won't necessarily pull you through."
3,Lewis Corey 1930,"How much of this ""The House of Morgan"" is really from Lewis Corey's The House of Morgan (1930)? Corey's work was brilliant."
2,Disappointed,"Frankly I was disappointed with the book. It is good popular history but not really serious history. For example, the author talks about how bad the 1987 stock market crash was but fails to mention that stocks end the year higher than they had begun. He mentions thousands of boards the various characters served on but not once in the 700 pages are we inside a board room. On reviewer talks about how he lavishes some areas with detail and then ignores others. I agree. I found myself wanting to know more many times. The mini-biographies throughout the book seem like the author simply is looking at an old photograph and sheds little else on the subject. I did make it through the book but found myself wanting more information."
3,detailed but somewhat long,"An interesting book showing the importance of capitalism, finance, and the power a single family on shaping nations not just the US. Though somewhat long winded.One thing that struck me was Chernow's somewhat detached account of the firm's history, usually painting the characters in The House of Morgan as basically good, and mainly philanthropic. The book does a good job of communicating the power of the corporation and Pierpont's view of competition as a ""destructive, inefficient force"" and subsequent dealings with the US government.Tom AndersonAnderson Analytics, LLChttp://www.andersonanalytics.com"
4,Americana at its best!,"I've always been a fan of Mark O'Connor and Yo-yo Ma, and when I first discovered this album, I couldn't wait to get it. Working with bassist Edgar Meyer, the men created a beautiful, lilting album that salutes the best of what instrumental folk music can be--and elevating it beyond that ""bluegrass jugband"" stigma.A classical album that promises to be nothing more than a shining example of virtuoso playing by three incredible musicians, ""Appalachia Waltz"" leaves very little to be desired--it is that good. My only wish is for a few more selections like the title track--quiet and contemplative songs that evoke warm nights on front porches. The majorityh of the selections are upbeat ""reel-like"" choices.Mastefully played, but with not quite enough moments to relax between the exciting parts."
4,More Waltz than Appalachia,"As expected, the music was wonderful. This a quite a grouping of fine musicians and the disc is well worth purchasing. My only disappointment was that it wasn't a little more toward the ""bluegrass"" side of music and was more toward the classical. However, just because this wasn't quite what I wanted, the composition and playing were excellant. This makes excellant background music for serious gatherings and reading."
4,Appalachia Waltz,"I bought this when it was first released and I have listened to it frequently. I really enjoy the compositions and the performances, but I would have liked it even more with a different 'cellist."
2,Durable plastic waterproof case.....well almost too durable..,I just received this case and was intending to use it on a cruise that I am taking for underwater photos so I wouldnt ruin my $$ camera. The plastic that it is made out of seems very durable but it is so thick and unmovable that my hands cannot adjust any of the controls on my camera. I just about fit the camera through the opening of the bag. There also is a lot of excess room in the bag (once you get it in) that the camera does not stay in place and you have to try to readjust it(which is almost impossible).I have not yet tried to actually use this case for photo taking but I think that it is still going to be useful just to keep my camera dry while taking it to the beach and on ship excursions. I would recommend this bag to someone who wants to keep their digital camera dry but not for picture taking in the water.
2,Definitely not the best recording,"This recording, however not horrible, is not that great. It was the first year that Abbado was in Berlin and the orchestra was definitely not used to him, and the playing shows. Things aren't always together, especially the second movement. There's even a major mistake by the third horn. Listen carefully on the sound sample above and you'll hear it. On the repeat, the horn came in a bar early, however he did try to cover it up quite nicely and not many people would probably notice if they weren't listening carefully. Overall I wouldn't recommend this CD, there are much better. For example, Bernstein's second one with the Royal Concertgebowe, Tennstedt's with Chicago, his last one, and I feel Solti's with Chicago is also a nice one to have."
4,A very good recording,"Personally, I don't think this recording is bad at all. In fact, it is extremely well. I have Bernstein's recording and this Abbado's version is as good as Bernstein's. The first movement is wonderfull. The second movement is far better than Bernstein's. The third is beautifull. The beginning of the fourth lacks of strength but the rest is very very well done. The only reason I would not put the 5 stars rate is because certainly I've heard recordings with better parts but this one has better parts than the same other versions I've heard."
3,Only harpsichord music,"To be entirely fair about this, I bought the CD for one performance, selection number 23 the Rondo Alla Turca by W.A.Mozart played superbly by Igor Kipnis. Now the 3 star grade... There is ONLY harpsichord on here. No violin, no cello, none of that beautiful brass or woodwinds. Having said that, if you want a sample of some very fine harpsichord music with none of that annoying orchestra noise covering up or getting in the way, then this little beaut is just what you want."
1,This is an AUDIO edition!,"The reading of this volume was almost unlistenable. It sounded like what I had heard described by a Kindle review describing the robotic delivery of ""Kindle reading"". I swear, the reader sounds as if he is imitating a machine with his odd and unnatural deflection. And, hey, other reviewer, this is not Richard Branagh reading this! Read the cover!I wish I had the Richard Branaugh version because this is so tedious, I don't know if I can tolerate it."
3,Too much,"The world of the rich-and-famous is ever fascinating. Here we're given entree into the Murphy world. If this is your favorite genre, you'll like this. However, I became satiated very early on too much richness, too many names, too many details. I found it over written, over talky. Everyone is charming (one way or another) and I can see why celeb advocates would adore this. Not I."
5,This was a wonderful book!,"I absoultely loved this book. I was so enthralled by the history and atmosphere that surrounded the Murphy's and this was a great example of a decadent couple in the 1920's. It took me 8 months to finish this book due to time constraints and by the time I finished, I felt like I knew the Murphys and was someone looking on as they lived their lives. It's a great thing to know Gerald and Sara were real people and lived real lifes and had real feelings and thoughts. I was amazed at how many people they knew and to the callibre of their characters, tragedies and happiness in their lives. I'd love to read more about the world of the 20's and this was a great, fabulous book to start with. As much as I love historical fiction, I loved this and Amanda Vaill did a wonderful job telling the story of the Murphys that more people should know."
2,cedar hangers- not for heavy clothing,"I bought this item to free up some closet space, but most of my clothes ended up on the floor. If you move these hangers, the regular hangers don't tend to stay securely hooked, and the cedar hangers can't take much weight. I used them for jackets, and it didn't really work."
3,ok product,"The cedar scent doesn't last very long and you have to strain to smell it. However, it does the job just fine."
2,Good but boring...,"This is a good book for someone who wants to get an idea about philosophy in general - the only drawback is that its very boring, I had a hard time to get to page 400 (i know there's more), if you'r the kind of person that can read boring stuff and go on with it, then this one is for you."
2,Not the USA pens as displayed,"Regardless of popular belief country of manufacture does make a difference. The USA branded version of these pens are great, the Mexico ones not even close to the same product. the USA pens write SMOOTH, the ink flows, great BIC pens. The Mexico ones, the ink is juddery, not what I would call smooth. I am now seeking the USA made ones because it appears BIC has moved this product manufacturing to somewhere where the wages are low and the quality has gone south. I Returned this order pronto, tell Amazon they need to ensure accuracy in product listings, I thought I was getting the USA pens as displayed, WRONG."
2,Least Favorite Kaufman Film,"I really liked Adaptation, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind & Being John Malkovich. Synecdoce has an interesting plot and a few fun moments, but it is not an ""enjoyable"" film. It's main character has many, many problems and spends years working on the same project. I felt that the same philosophical point was being made over & over, which was probably intended, but which started to bore me. However, if you can stick with it, the ending is satisfying in a melancholic sort of way."
2,Leads of their own stories,"I had really high hopes for this film but it did not deliver. I got the philosophical projections on ego, how we can't live isolated, how we all influence each other, how every choice affects everything... But this film didn't do those conceits the justice that ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" or ""Being John Malkovich"" did. If anything it bludgeoned them repeatedly into the audience's mind, while leaving other obtuse aspects virtually undeveloped. The film moved depressingly slow, which although laborious conveyed great tension. But that's all it did. My highest praise for this film is that realistically portrayed the inner workings of a writer's mind, sometimes with frightening accuracy. Beyond that I lost interest in the glacially crawling plot about 45 minutes in."
2,"I guess you just can't ""get it"" if you don't have a PhD in Philosophy","Fortunately (or unfortunately) I don't have one and therefore can't agree with all 5-star reviews of this movie. I guess I am just not sophisticated enough to ""get"" this ""masterpiece"" (which is strange because I happen to enjoy other Kaufman's movies).The movie starts promisingly. I quite enjoyed the first 1/3 when character of Caden Cotard and his family life are introduced. But the moment Caden receives the grant and starts working on his play, all sense goes out of the movie. It feels simply like an image of a mind of a crazy depressed person.Bottom line, I found this movie indulgent and trying too hard to be ""special,"" ""original,"" and ""profound.""Two stars for cast and acting that was quite remarkable."
1,I fell asleep,Didn't see it to the end. Won't. But it's a good movie if you're having some trouble getting to sleep.
1,Lixo total,"Imagine um Chopin onde só o virtuosismo e a ""destruio"" do teclado é a constante. Im agine um Chopin agressivo e desprovido quase totalmente de rubatos.Francamente,acho que Argerich no tinha a inteno de tocar Chopin."
5,You must read the old testament with this book side by side.,"The Kingdom of God by John Bright, renown Professor Emeritus of Hebrew and the interpretation of the Old Testament at Union Theological Seminary in Va., is the best cpompanion book you could read along with the Old Testament. This man has a deep understanding of how God works in history, then and now. His profound insights are founded not only in his ability to think in Hebrew and understand original meanings, but also his knowledge of history. His personal knowledge of who God is the thread that makes this book prophetic as well as practicle. I have been reading it over and over for 20 years without tiring. It is a book for the layperson as well as the student. If this book appeals to you, I highly recommend ""A History of Israel"" although it is much more of a textbook."
5,Best game I've ever played!,"More challenging than you would expect, consider it's rated ""E"" and based on a Suess book. Graphics are awesome, looks just like the movie."
5,A VERA,Excellent CD. Zeca at his best. Cade meu Amor is highly memorable and pleasurable to listen to.
4,Good map but not as detailed as I'd hoped.,"I bought this map for camping in the national forests. Since this is a recreation atlas, I thought that all the forest service roads would be on it. Unfortunately, many of the small service roads are not on this map. This is still a good map for those that don't plan on going far into the ""back woods"" but not what I was expecting."
3,Its good enough to own.,Yo Comin from a dirty dude that mainly listen to the abstract hip hop and the underground artist I liked it. Yo some of the songs were too commercial but you can expect that because its G-Unit. The songs were catchy not really creative and the production was tight in my opinion. This is one of those love it or hate albums. I chose to love it nor hate. It really never struck me as garbage at all. Now on the other hand some of the features like for example: (Obie Trice) showed up lyrically. Yayo is not really a lyricist he just a hood dude that rap and he got his chance to speak his peace. I think with a few adjustments in his style and creative ability he will be a formidable artist in the rap game. If not then you know whateva.
3,Ehhh... Not what it should have been,"This CD, When I heard Drama Setter thats what made me buy it.. I was hyped. and G-Unit yet again dissapointed..The Good Tracks1. Homicide2. So Seductive3. Drama Setter4. We Dont Give a F*ck5. Curious6. Pimpin'But you know what? 6 Tracks doesn't make a CD good. Start putting out some better beats, not beats that sound cheap, and like they're from the 90's or a mixtape, get more collaborations, and some better lyrics.. G-Unit.. dont die on us, your losing the tight grip you used to have on the rap industry, because, nobody's even scared of you no more."
4,IT IS WHAT IT IS,"COME ON PEOPLE,THIS ALBUM IS NOT THAT BAD.YOU JUST HAVE TO LISTEN TO IT MORE THAN ONCE FOR YOU TO FEEL IT,PLUS YAYO IS NOT WACK.HE MAY NOT BE A VERY GOOD LYRICIST OR SPIT HOT VERSES LIKE LLOYD BANKS BUT HEY,HE'S GOT POTENTIAL."
3,Untitled,"This album was O.K. Somewhat of a weak start for YAYO but he had some good tracks on there. G-Unit's presence helps. The album is worth buying due to the fact that currently most albums hardly have 5/6 descent tracks...and besides unless you got a number one album out or have produced one you really shouldnt criticize, especially if you live in Wisconsin..."
1,I want my Money Back,"After Buying this cd and listing to it I had to think quick.And I made the right decision I scratched the CD and took it back to the store and exchanged it for Kanye West new cd. Tony Yayo's cd isnt impressive at all he is on the lyrical level of a Hiliary Duff . The ""Hiliary Duff"" of rap you might say. Get Kanye's CD if you want some real music."
1,"skip this, buy Jeezy's cd","Here's really what's up - the bottom line is that starting with the massacre, the cd's coming out of the gunit camp are weak, period. They were hot (2+ years ago) but now success has spoiled them. 50 is jacking beats from Ghostface, Yayo is sampling Britney Spears, now the # of R&B; songs are increasing and I hear Irv Gotti is going to produce Oliver's cd ... that's all I'm saying. lol ... that ho's a man!I'm one of the few Banks' fans out there and I hope he gets someone else to produce his cd. Jesus please don't let fif ruin Banks' sophomore cd like he did yayos. Real folk is buying Jeezy's cd anyway, Yayo is corny and Game was right. I consider this a flop and when Kanye's sales stomp Yayo's, fif says kanye owes it to 50. ha ... it's a wrap fif, hang it up, stick a fork in it, etc"
4,Best of G-Unit!!,"Yayo is the best of G-Unit! All the songs are good, but some aren't great. Everything is good/great"
1,This album should be Tony's 3rd felony....,"This album did not make any sense to me. It's just some more commercial garbage pumped out to make money. Remember the days of Biz Markie, De La Soul, and Digital Underground. These guys all had their own style, and used humor to bring a lighter side to life in the ghetto. These days nobody is willing to stray away from the gangsta sh*t in fear they won't make money. This album is a perfect example of that. Have you seen the music video for seductive? What does the video have to with lyrics? Well that seems to be a constant theme with this album. From the title, to the lyrics, to the videos and the beats. It doesn't make any sense. I'm just waiting for Tony to come out with his own clothing line. ha! Trust me, save your money."
1,Terrible Thoughts,"...This Album Is The Definition of A Big Pile of Crap From A Flesh Eating Bacteria-Infested Cow....Who Would Buy This? Only Brain Deprived People Who Have Become Slaves To G-Unit!!!!! That's Who! I Admit I Bought It And Listened To It, Ten Minutes Into It, It Was In The Fireplace!!!! Only Buy It If You Wanna Go Def!!!"
1,Why did 50 release this below average rapper Yayo,I thought the production on this album was gonna be tight. Cause usually G-unit gets great production on there albums. But the production wasnt even that good. Yayo is probably on of the worse rappers every to release an album. (The doc and The Massacre were extremly better than this crap). There are a few standouts on this album but Yayo doesnt drop one really dope verse on the whole album.01. Intro02. Homicide 3.5/5 - The Beat is on point but Yayo hook is just sooooooooooooo baaaaaaad!!!!!!!!03. It Is What It Is 4/5 dope track04. Tattle Teller 3/5 another weak hook05. So Seductive 4/5 tight club joint but Yayo singing is terrible06. Eastside Westside 3.5.507. Drama Setter 5/508. We Don't Give a F*** 5/509. Pimpin 2/510. Curious 1/511. I'm So High 4/512. Love My Style 3/513. Project Princess 1/514. G-S*** 4/515. I Know You Don't Love Me 4/516. Dear Suzie 1/517. Live by the Gun 4/5
1,I wish there was a rating lower than one star,"Ok! Ok! Ok! The votes have been tallied and counted! And RE-COUNTED! And it's undeniable, Tony Yayo is a horrible a rapper. He's ALREADY forgotten by many, and he'll be forgotten by all before long. ""Where's Tony? Remember that guy?"" , ""No"". I agree, The Game saw this coming the whole way and steered clear. His CD is still in my six-disc. 50, you made a mistake. You've shown your weaknesses; 1. Money 2. Tony Yayo. I really honestly thought that you would repeat and make a cd at least as good as the first, but I heard MAYBE 3 bangers...on a CD with over 20 songs? That has to be a failure. Undeniable. Your movie may or may not suck, but I'll tell you this. I'm not watchin' it. If the title of this cd holds true, then ""Tony, keep your thoughts to yourself."""
2,Educational? Yes. Fun? NO!,"Based on how other reviewers said this book was the life of their Christmas party, I expected to find funny or bizarre facts that would get people laughing or at least amazed. These are very dry Trivial Pursuit type facts, presented in a simple Q&A format. You might learn something, but DON'T bring this to a party, unless the party is for the history club."
1,Don't buy this,"Don't purchase this item...it shipped without the hardware fitting and the directions are idiotic. Additionally, it is made for someone who isn't short...so make sure you know the measurements of how you will fit in it. I am angry I spent good money on this."
4,Very cute Book,"My kids always loved this, so I bought it for my niece's little girl. She loves it too."
5,Kinky Boots,It came quickly...had no flaws either in the movie or it's packaging. The only problem I hadwas submitting this review. You put people through a lot. Just hitting five stars shouldsatisfy you.
4,Fab Movie,"Love the music, the show scenes and story line and fab shoe's they are hot....Nothing drag about drag ...."
2,Not standards-based,"I've used this textbook with my 5th Grade class sparingly because I find it is not aligned to Louisiana standards at all. For example, 5th Graders are expected to be able to compare and contrast animal and plant cells. The textbook never explains the difference. As I recall it does not even describe one of the type of cells and definitely does not go into the parts of the cell. The book does have beautiful pictures, and was helpful at times. Unfortunately, I relied mainly on other resources to teach my students this year. I would prefer a more standards-aligned book that can actually be an integral part of the learning process."
4,It's Pocket Fun in a Hat !!!,When Doctor Suess wrote the book the Cat in the Hat little kids were excited to be able to read something that wasn't lame.The same goes for the animated series. Now the movie has been released so the entire family can enjoy. And for the member who likes video games your gonna love this.15 levels of pure fun that takes you beyond the movie with especially designed enemies just for the game. Vivendi Universal got the Movie-Based video game perfect this time .This is nothing like that god awful E.T.game by E.A. games . A must have for anyone who owns a Game Boy Advance !!!
4,A fascinating look at a complex character,"By choosing specific periods of time in Jefferson's life, and not apologizing for skipping over his less-important years, Ellis gets to the root of Thomas Jefferson's personal and political beliefs, and attempts to explain the enigma that Jefferson most certainly was.Ellis writes in a way that makes you think he was there. It wouldn't have surprised me if he revealed that he had figured out a way to interview Jefferson for the book.Highly recommended for anyone who finds most history tomes to be boring. You will not be bored here."
4,Come to know Jefferson the man,"Rather than churning out a full-scale biography, Ellis explores several crucial periods of Jefferson's life in depth, showing how each of them enables us to understand the complexities of the man and what made him tick. This book is a slow read because there is so much to think about on every page. A man of ideas and vision, Jefferson was an incredibly complex and conflicted individual, capable of carrying out multiple levels of deception and subterfuge even from himself. I never realized what a radical libertarian Jefferson was before I read this book. It was a good thing he had the other Founding Fathers around to curb his revolutionary spirit! In spite of the reverence which most people feel for him today, he died feeling his life had been a tragedy. A great book for anyone who wants to come away feeling they now know Jefferson the man."
1,Should head own advice,"The author starts the book by warning that it is a tired subject which will make it hard to present anything new. At least with this book he was correct. He seems to be intimidated by his subject and has a very immature and insidious way of being derogatory towards TJ without any proof. Without the massive cut and paste sections this book would be very short and the author would (and does anyway) come across as extraordinarily insecure.In the end the author fails absolutely to figure out that TJ was a master politician though often times the reluctant and multi-faceted politician. He goes on and on towards tediousness trying to understand certain behaviors that to even a casual observer screams ""politician""! If you want to learn alot about the insecurities of the author this a great book, but for insights or interesting perspectives on TJ I would look elsewhere."
5,Same tracks as on Halloween Sha Na Na Oldies Party,"This CD is listed as available only from 3rd party sellers, but you can get the exact same 12 tracks on another Sha Na Na CD, titled ""Halloween Sha Na Na Oldies Party,"" for under $7.00 right from Amazon. Note: THE Halloween CD's description (and back of CD case) doesnt list ""My Prayer and ""The Bird and the Bees,"" but guess what -- they are on the CD, and in the same order as this ""not available"" CD."
3,Outdated But Lots of Fun,"Jackie Patterson explains and demonstrates several of the older hip-hop moves such as ""running man,"" ""vogueing,"" and several others. The male dancers wear spandex, not the baggy look, that's how old this tape is! Still, the dancers are great showing lots of energy and enthusiasm. The structure of the tape is excellent, with a complete routine as an intro, then a breakdown of each move in both slow and regular motion, and then ending with a different complete routine. It's a great workout even if you'd be embarrassed to do this stuff on a late-90s dance floor. I just wish Patterson would produce a more up-to-date tape. END"
3,not as good as the title suggests,"Three obvious great musicians on this cd, however, the music selected is not as good as could have been selected, overall these guys are the epitomy of country music, however, I think a better selection could have been put together."
4,Last of the Breed,"Enjoyed it very much, this is the last of the Breed that is for sure.No one else like them."
3,Good watch - Not great,"First off, the watch band in the picture doesn't look glossy, but in real life, it's glossy. Secondly, by today's fashion standards, the case makes this almost a women's watch.It's still a nice looking watch, but I would only wear this with long sleeve shirts (i.e. dress shirts or a suit). If you're planning on wearing this with casual wear, it would look silly. First off, the glossy watch band is not casual. Secondly, while wearing short sleeve shirts, this watch seriously looks like a little bracelet. Just my opinion, but for nice casual watches, I'd go for a non-glossy band and a 40mm case diameter."
5,Great watch!,Looks sleek and the eco drive function works well. Feels pretty durable and I love that you can swap out the straps.
3,Watch- five stars Service - not so great,"Bought this in 2009, and it has been a great watch. Nice looking, keeps perfect time, and stays charged. The band gradually fell apart over the past 12 months, and finally failed with the buckle pulling through the leather. Have not had this experience with other leather bands. Sent it back to Citizen's service dept. No comment from them on band failure; charged $50 for replacement; more than half the price of the watch. If this is representative of the pricing of their factory service, should consider the watch disposable. If it fails, throw it away and buy a new one."
4,Citizen Time,"When it has came down to Citizen after all these years, they still definitely know how to really make excellent watches for everyone. But there are those that really don't want too many gimmicks in their watches. Fortunately, they can make that with this Eco-Drive Black Leather Watch. It doesn't have all the gimmicks that other watches have, keeping it simple with each tick of the watch, from its beautiful leather strap, to telling time with its built-in eco-drive technology by never running out of energy by natural and even your house lights in the living room. It really never stops ticking. It really is worth its money for anyone who wants a high-quality watch, without the strain from your wallet. I absolutely recommend Citizen as one of the best brand watches for all your everyday needs. This watch designed with a leather strap, does it all, and I absolutely recommend this for the man in everyday quality.Price: BConvience: B+Quality: B 1/2+Overall: B 1/2+"
1,Could not change day and date,Handsome watch but sent it back after opening. I tried many times. Then my wife tried a number of times. We could easily adjust the time but were unable to find just the right spot to change the day and date. Unacceptable.
1,STAY AWAY!!!!,"After about 8 months of weekend use (about 12 shots per weekend), the pump died. All the other negatives stack up very quickly after using my new Breville 840XL! After treating myself to the new Breville this weekend, I realized just how messy this machine is to operate. Soupy grounds, leaky head after making coffee, very small water reservoir capacity, shallow drip tray (when combined with the leaky head is just plain messy!), the filter basket that seemed to always disconnect from the handle and stick to the head, etc. etc. etc. I paid $400 for this machine (bought it for looks as it was my first machine), and it is a total ripoff! Stay away from the Espressione. I still have it in my basement and dont have the heart to throw it away even though the pump is shot."
2,What a let down!,"well I anxiously awaited the arrival of my new Espressione Retro today and was utterly dissapointed when I tried to steam 2 cups of milk for a latte. Although as promised the machine does not take long to heat up to 100C for espresso and 150C for frother, it has a tiny boiler. It gives good initial steam but it is very short lived. It requires waiting again and again to heat up a small amount of liquid. It took me 4 rounds of lever lifting and waiting to heat and froth the 2 cups of milk. (Simply unacceptable)could have saved a lot of time heating on stove top and finishing with Aerolatte handheld frother.The espresso was pretty good but filter holder is cheap and assembly-oriented."
5,must read,a must read for all mature christians seeking a deeper understanding of our God. author appears to be well connected to the Holy Spirit when writing his books.
2,average historical fiction,"I didn't think as much of this book as I did Kaufman's The Book of Eleanor. Alix was an annoying character, her disguise as a boy and ""romance"" with King Richard contrived."
2,not what it seems,"I am studying chen style for a couple of years now and and trying to gain some more insight into its complex technique. The appearance and product description suggest this dvd might be helpfull. The techniques you find on this dvd are very basic and not explained. The quality is also very poor, it's just a vhs tape they put on dvd. There are a lot of good dvd from china now, cheaper, better quality, better content. This is not worth spending your money on."
1,"could have been interesting, turned out stupid","What a waste of 2 hours.basic plot goes something like: boy is dumb. boy likes girls, has no chance. boy is embaresed in public(in most innane and tasteless fashion) and switches schools. does stupid and innane and tasteless things. disses old friends. people find out. boy gets girl, badguys go away, all is well.drivel. snot. not worth any sane persons time. maybe a few middle schoolers will find value in this waste of plastic and money."
1,BORING!,WHAT!? This movie was suppose to be good. NO WAY! If you have not seen this movie DON'T waste your time on it. It was so boring that i couldn't even stand it for the first 5 minuetes. I wouldn't even waste 1 cent on this movie. This movie is a total waste of time. I would rather watch Barney!
2,The New Guy proves only 1 thing...,...That D J Qualls (co-star in Road Trip) cannot carry a movie. The two stars is here only because any movie with the presence of Eliza Dushku is elevated above one star automatically.
2,i have one question to ask! WHY?!,thats all i have to say. ill explain. CMON! WUTS UP WIT THIS? THIS IS TERRIBLE. I WASNT FELLIN THIS MOVIE. CMON ITS ABOUT AN OUTKAST TRYIN TO BE COOL WHICH HE CANNOT DO NO MATTER HOW HARD HE TRIES. THIS MOVE WASNT THAT GOOD.
3,New Guy,"hmmm, it was that good, kinda disappointing, i was up for so laughs but got about 5 out of the whole movie."
5,A joyful read - infinitely better than the movie!,"I read Dona Flor and Her Two Husbands some 20 years ago, and it impressed me so much and stayed with me that I just bought a copy as a Birthday present for my brother, a Medieval English professor. I still have my own copy for re-reading (as well as many other novels by Jorge Amado). If you've only seen the movie, you don't know what you've missed.Jorge Amado is within the realm of Latin American 'magical realism'. Dona Flor's husband dies, she remarries, but her husband returns as a 'ghost' only she can see. His commentary to and about his (ex-) mother-in-law, while in her presence though she (the mother-in-law) cannot see or hear him (but Dona Flor can) are hilarious. It's perhaps what many men (and women) might wish for."
1,"Five-year-old technology, should be $60, not $600","This is a very old Thinkpad notebook and the processor technology is at least 3 years old. If it were $60 it would have made a nice starter machine for a teenage kid, but otherwise it's a waste of money and totally not worth it. For the same money you can get a new Toshiba or Fujitsu that's 50 times faster with a screen that's 20 times better."
1,This was a good laptop... 5 YEARS AGO,"I cannot believe Amazon is trying to sell this for $500. Go to Dell, HP or Gateway online and you can find a new, much nicer, lighter, faster laptop with longer battery life for the same price. Seriously, I might buy something like this for $199 or $99. But this hardware is seriously dated. This is Pentium 3! This was first released back in 2001. Whatever you do, don't buy this for someone as a gift. You may loose a friend, get a divorce, or strain a family relationship to the breaking point."
1,MIS-INFORMATION ABOUT THIS GAME IRRITATING,"The Windows XP version says it comes on a CD...Wrong! It comes on a DVD...I would also like to add that the System requirements for this game seem to be Top Secret?? Amazon doesn't list them as of this writing and a visit to the EA SPORTS NBA Live 07 website doesn't either.My Grandson received one of these for his 9th birthday and the only place you find the System requirements is on the smudged cellophane wrapper and it is written so small you practically need a magnifier to read it. Even though my Grandson has a pretty new Dell computer with plenty of CPU and Memory and DVD drive, it would not install because it doesn't have the right Video Card. What's with keeping this information so secret EA ?? Do you like returns and wasting people's time?How about joining the Information Age and getting your act together!!It's NO FUN if you can't even install it and after all of the above it won't get installed but returned for a refund."
1,Simply Awful,"Just a porous effort on every level. Not much has changed from the 2006 version except that the game play is evermore lop-sided and ridiculous. Interface options are convoluted, the website for patches is a joke and the actions on the court seemed to have been programmed, animated and mo-capped by Stevie Wonder.Glad I received it as a gift and I didn't spend the cake on this junk. I know EA lost its way a long time ago (they actually DID make great games about 10 years ago) and is simply in it for the bottom line at this point. My ban on buying EA products continues and we (the wise consumers) will be left standing when the last EA studio closes."
4,Good as Recommended before,Followed the previous recommendations. Right on !!!!!!!!!Wonderful product == works as advertised -- makes G R E A T waffles.
1,"Used Twice, Then Died","Used twice to make a total of six waffles. In the middle of making the seventh, the iron shut off. Let it cool, checked the outlet to make sure it was working but no luck. It's dead. Too bad, I'd try a replacement but Amazon is out of stock."
2,Not impressed,This was actually my first waffle maker but I've used and tasted the ones they have in hotels. I was quite disappointed with the outcome. We've tried different recipes (including the one that came with the machine which was by far the worst) and the waffles just taste right.The temperature either gets too hot or not hot enough and have to be very careful not to burn yourself in the process.
4,Murphy's Law,"1 - makes great waffles - 2 - problem: waffles are very tall so you must use a ton of syrup or they seem dry - 3 - you may not want a belgian waffler but opt instead for a regular waffler if the tons of syrup required is a problem for you-this is what i would have bought if i had known - 4 - Murphy (our dog) is deathly afraid of the buzzer telling you a waffle's ready, i can't figure out how to turn down or off the buzzer - 5 - the waffles actually work best for us using a normal bisquick waffle recipe & the waffles have a wonderful taste & texture - 6 - another great thing about this waffler is the belgian design being so deep you can avoid a lot of the batter overflow waste & mess found using non-belgian wafflers - 7 - the best wafflers are presidents, politicians & villaware"
4,Just so you know--NOT Alton Brown's recommendation.,"I was recently watching Alton Brown's show about waffles, and then came looking for the waffle iron he used on his show. Some reviewers are stating that this Villaware Belgian waffler is the waffle iron recommended on the show. It isn't. The iron used on the show is the Villaware V2004 Uno Series Classic Round Waffle Maker Waffler (not the Belgian version). I'm sure they're both good, but they're also different.Just thought some of you guys might want to know. The classic version seems like it is harder to find, but there are still some out there. If Amazon is out, try eBay or even Williams-Sonoma."
2,Sorry I bought it,"All of the reviews I read said this waffle maker was a great product. I was so disappointed in that it only browns on one side. I've tried flipping it over, leaving it on longer, everything!! But....nothing will get the bottom brown and when you pour syrup on the waffles, they get so soggy.I wouldn't recommend this product."
2,Great idea...so so execution,"I don't get all the rave reviews here. I've owned this CD since it came out in 1997 and its been probably more than 5 years since I had a desire to listen to it. Now listening to it trying to figure out what I want to put on my I-pod and I really can't find anything other than the 1st 2 tracks, which are great. The Filter/Crystal Method track is a classic. But beyond that I just find the songs somewhere between mildly interesting and boring. I am a fan of many of the rock & electronic artists here, but this experiment just didn't pan out in my opinion. It's been 10 years and I haven't seen any other collections like this so I must not be in the minority. Nice try, but there is not much more here beyond the concept."
3,A taste of the sounds to come,The re-engineering of the more live bands by the electronic whiz-kids turns the music on it's ear. Most of these bands would benefit from keeping this kind of thing up. I'm just happy to hear Roni Size and Soul Coughing's differing approach to their track.
5,"Didn't see the movie, but the soundtrack kicks a**....","well, i'm one of those people who spends hours at the music store determining of i want to buy a cd... well, i happened to be looking at soundtracks and i came across this one.... looking at the artists (being an alternative/heavy metal/techno-rave fan) i realized i really liked the cd although not having seen the movie.. oh well.. i bought it and i was so suprised b/c i've heard of the sneaker pimps before but not many people have and i was ecstatic that they were on here... anyhoo, this cd is great if you're into hardcore music... it'll rock you to your toes.... :P"
1,"Worst ""comedy"" ever.","This was painful to watch. I wanted it to end. NOT funny, maybe some parts were, but that doesn't make up for the pathetic story line and characters. Twilight is a better comedy then this!! Watch the Hangover, Horrible Bosses or just about any other comedy then this, as I'm sure it will be 100% better then anything this could produce."
4,dumb humor,if your into dumb humor...or watching artie lang trying to act in a PG 13 arena....this is a good buy
4,The slickest Brahms Fourth you can get.,"Abbado's reading is sleek and slick. The tempi are about perfect, though the third movement is a little slow. The fourth movement is amazingly strong, though the strings overpower everything else. One would wish for more brass. The biggest flaw of this recording is not Abbado's or the BPO, but the sound engineers. It suffers from severe digitis. The Digital recording turns what should be crackling timpani into a thudding muddle. You'd think they weren't pitched instruments. Any bass instruments tend to get melded into an amorphous bass sound. Hopefully remastering can fix this. In spite of that, the reading is thrilling in nearly every aspect, and the playing of the BPO has rarely been finer. This is a clean performance."
3,I like this book but not always correct,"I had been using this book for awhile, but it started to interfere with and confuse my tarot interpretations. Be advised that although the book as a whole is an interesting addition to your tarot library, some of his entries are simply incorrect from the point of view of traditional card meanings. Others take the traditional meanings and build on them, and this is the best use of the book. I would give it four stars if it stated up front that you need other books. This one by itself is not enough, altho as I said, it is an interesting and worthwhile read."
3,clear is not concise,"i just started using this book, as my old back up <u>tarot in 10 minutes</u> is falling apart. i'm not used to the layout yet, but i love all the information packed into this book. it touches on anything i've ever thought about asking for the card meanings."
5,"Clear and concise, simply ourstanding!","Look no further, this is simply the best tarot introduction book. The book is really all-round, written in a clear and simple language which everyone can understand. I have several other tarot introductory books, but all of them fail to give me clear explanations of the court cards (maybe it's just me:-)), and the court cards have been a headache to me when it comes to doing a tarot reading. Now with Tarot Plain and Simple, I finally begin to grasp the court cards and put them into my reading at ease.Most importantly, the book doesn't skimp on the reversals. Most tarot books for beginners seldom put emphasis on reversals and tell you to neglect it. This one doesn't. The explanation of every card's reversal is as detailed as the upright meaning, and right to the point. I am really impressed.Five stars, no doubt."
5,Truly...plain & simple,"If you are like me, nowing nothing much about TAROT, this is a good companion to learn about the history and about the cards themselves."
5,Stant Lev-R-Vent,"Ever since I turned 16 in in 1976 I have used the Stant Lev-R-Vent. It is the best most obvious safety device I can imagine. Anyone who has ever had to open a hot radiator knows how dangerous they can be. This ought to be mandatory for all cars in my opinion. The red safety level lets any user draw off the pressure into the cars radiator reservoir safely before opening. Sometimes they have been hard to find, but now that I found them here online at Amazon; the safe choice is obvious. Buy one for now and buy a spare. Replace them regularly when you change the coolant. Low pressure from a worn out cap can also lead to boil over. It is well worth the money. Who wants to risk hot radiator fluid scalding ones hand? Any other cap is often a struggle to remove, but not this one. That is the best reason to buy one."
5,Quality Product from Stant,Stant has always been synonyms with quality radiator caps. This product is no exception.The let-r-vent feature is great for relief of pressure when you dont feel like waiting for cool down or getting burned by steaming coolant.Lasts just as long as OEM if not longer.
4,Surpisingly good !!,"Let's face it, I own vinyl of these guys. Long time fan discovers a good dvd of a great band. The only thing that would put this over the top would be either the original band (no longer possible I know) or a slightly better song selection. I'm still glad i purchased it and you will be too."
2,Rollerball review,"Never buy a movie, just because someone else liked it. James Cahn never could act."
3,Intonation Impairs Fine Performance of Great Quintet,"Lovers of this great quintet, D.956, will perhaps want a recording other than this one with the Emerson Quartet and Rostropovich. Fine as the interpretion is, the musicians are NOT in tune. The cellos are not in tune with the violins and viola; and the cellos are often out of tune with each other--in virtually all the movements, including the Adagio, where precision of intonation is crucial. Moreover, the mike-ing of this live performance is off-kilter, and the cello parts are given a prominence which is musicially distressing, as they overbalance (in particular) the 1st violin and, of course, the inner voices. If you don't have a good sense of pitch and intonation, you could be happy with this recording. I wasn't. The Emerson has done better, i.e., with Haydn's ""Seven Last Words of Christ."" Schubert deserves better."
4,Great!,As advertised this is perfect for my HHR... you could actually go a little wider if you wanted. I would reccomend it definately.
5,Good purchase,Hurrah a replacement branded by panasonic. Don't have to worry third party quality or lack there of. Got what I wanted. earlier then scheduled. Would recommend.
4,Does the job !,"I agree with Jim's June 2009 review of this product. The prices are all over the place and I can't figure out why. I just ordered 2 more @ $6.99 each with free shipping from an Amazon.com vendor. Other prices here are up to $25.00. Why???My pkg also had a $24.99 retailer price tag on the package. Keep your receipt and package insert info. The item's packaging insert says there is a 2 yr. warranty. I have read of issues with the plastic wings and hinges. I assume this would be covered under warranty.I plan to be gentle with mine and I think it will last. It certainly does the job. I tried a Flipbac and cannot figure out what the value is in that product. If you don't take pictures from low or odd angles, I think it is worthless. And.....since a mirror is involved, all the info on your camera's LCD screen is reversed.....Try reading ""turn on flash"" backwards.....This product makes it easier to see my camera's LCD screen in the sun and that's just what I needed !"
5,A Practical Guide for a Child's Sleep Problems,"Dr. Ferber presents a practical guide for parents struggling with their child's sleep problems. This informative and comprehensive book covers all possible causes for sleep disorders in children and offers solutions that, in most cases, work.The Appendix in the back of the book provides further information and resources for those wishing to learn more about the subject.This is a book that all parents of children with sleep problems should read and have handy for reference when attempting to end those sleepless nights.I found the information about eliminating feedings from the night to be particularly helpful. My son was nursing every three hours throughout the night. By following Dr. Ferber's plan, I was able to eliminate all night feedings."
5,Practical advice for parents,"Excellent guide to sleeping problems in children with a great sectionabout sleep stages, etc. in childred. Well done."
1,good way to destroy your childs self esteem,"studies show that children left to ""cry it out"" are more prone to develop self esteem problems. the child assumes that because the parents ignore its needs they are of little importance and value. well your kids personality is stuffed but at least the parents can sleep ok. can only recomend this book if you dont care about the way your child develops emotionally. outdated barbaric ideas. thumbs down."
2,Take what you can and leave the rest behind,"There seem to be two camps on the ""CIO"" theory -- Dr. Ferber and Dr. Sears. I think you have to take some pieces of each. Dr. Ferber seems to have helped many people, but I found his ways to be too ""black and white"" and just too cold for me. But I did use some of his advice and was able to get my son to sleep through in just a week (without crying it out)."
3,Its good overall,"All in all, this was a good book. However, it does have its weaknesses, as well as its strentghts. One thing I like about the was Richard Ferber writes, is how he approaches each sleep problem. He first identifies the problem, explaining what it is. Then Ferber descibes what causes the problem, followed by a well thought out solution to the problem. This step by step process makes this book all the more a helpful resource. Another plus to this book is the broad range of sleep problems it covers. The author covers in depth the most common, and some not so common sleep disorders. This is good because a parent can read just this book and find out about a sleep disorder thei child might have.One of the weaknesses in this book is when the author describes colic as an illness. After talking about this topic in class, we know that it has been proven to be false. Colic is not an infant sleep disorder."
1,Pleeeease consider other alternatives first.,"Babies are not machines or dogs. They are as human as you and me and treating them like a programmable piece of meat is not a good way to raise healthy children. I truly believe that babies need sleep and that as parents it is our responsibility to help them learn to sleep. The problem is teaching is not always easy and it requires creativity and patience. I also am very sad to say I have yet to find a really good book on sleep for babies. There are only the two extremes. Leave a tiny, helpless baby in fear and anguish until sleeping or always help them to sleep. I guarantee Ferber's book while full of information on sleep has nothing to offer conscientious parents. Please do not be fooled by the persuasive language. Try your parenting intuition instead."
4,saved my sanity,My pediatrician told me to buy this book and that if it didn't work to bring it to him and he would give me my money back. It worked wonders and restored the sleep of two very weary parents. I am a nurse and did not find one problem with this doctors methods. Co-bedding is very dangerous and I have seen four babies in the last 2 years die in my community from tired parents smoothering their babies during the night when they roll over on them. You and your child will sleep much better with your own space to be comfortable in. If your child has a sleeping problem try this book.
5,Great sequel to the 'Daggerspell',"This book is as great as 'Daggerspell'. The tangled Wyrd of Nevyn, Brangwen and Blaen souls start to unfold, but it is still far from resolving. Their souls reincarnate from life to life, each time a bit more untangled than before and in 'Darkspell' there is some of incarnations. The whole concept of dweomer, or in particular of human perception of five forces of universe as mindless wildfolk is stunning. Great reading time on enchanted language of Deverry."
3,"Extensive, but flawed document collection","While the editors are operating from a mindset formed, I suspect, in the late 1970s and 1980s, they have included a good deal of useful historical material, some of it translated from French and German for the first time. Apparently, the gathering of material began about 20 years ago, so that there is no coverage of the contribution of Queer Theory. Also, some items are abridged, without proper notification--a serious flaw in what purports to be an objective presentation of source documents. I noticed serious omissions, for example, in the English renderings of the three pamphlets from the time of the French Revolution."
5,"LIKE SHAKESPEARE, ONLY IN REGULAR ENGLISH","THIS BOOK CHANGED MY LIFE - I THOUGHT I UNDERSTOOD THE WORLD, BUT THE INSIGHTS OF THIS TEENAGED BUDDHA OPENED MY EYES! IT'S A GOOD THING THIS GUY DIDN'T FORM AN EMO BAND OR ELSE WE'D ALL BE MISSING OUT ON A GREAT BOOK! HEY ALL YOU NAYSAYERS - DID YOU EVERY CONSIDER THAT THIS KID MAYBE IS WAY SMARTER THAN YOU? AND EVERYONE ELSE IN HIS CREATIVE WRITING CLASS, INCLUDING THE TEACHER? DO YOU KNOW WHAT THAT'S LIKE? I DO, NOW THAT I READ THE BOOK - IT SUCKS! AND DID YOU GUYS EVEN READ THE ADMIRING BLURB FROM LARRY KING ON THE BACK COVER? YOU'RE TELLING ME THAT YOU'RE SMARTER THAN LARRY KING? YEAH, RIGHT! ANYWAY, IF YOU SHARE MY LOVE FOR POOR EDITING, MISUSED POLYSYLLABIC WORDS, SIMPLE RHYMING SCHEMES, AND DEEP-SOUNDING (IT'S A LITTLE OVER MY HEAD!) INSIGHTS, PICK UP THIS COLLECTION! BETWEEN TWO JUNES IS A MASTERPIECE!"
2,"Good characters, bad science","Like the other reviewers, I read this book as a kid in 1959. Unlike them, I cannot recommend it. Although the characters are likeable, the story is crippled by the fact that the author is almost entirely clueless about computers. Of course in the Fifties, unlike now, this was true of most people, so the author's ignorance is understandable--but the many conceptual errors in the plot really hurt the storyline, and are likely to make young modern-day readers cringe with embarrassment--or simply discard the book, unfinished."
3,Not what I thought,Arrived a little dingy and says English/Spanish colors as you push the tenticles of the octopus. If you don't push them just right then it won't play.
2,A bland performance not worth the money,"If you've ever seen Maxwell live you'll know that this cd is a sad representation of what his show really is. Perhaps it's the audience's lack of enthusiasm that brings the energy levels way down or the song list that doesn't do Maxwell justice-meaning too much ""woo-ing and wha-ing."" Save your cash and go buy D'angelo's ""Live at the Jazz Cafe"" if you want something truly exciting."
1,Malfunctioned after 1 year,"So after a year it started to chirp. The instructions state that this means the battery is weak. Additionally you're supposed to use compressed air to blow or a vacuum to suck out dust, as I know that moisture captured in dust particles can cause malfunction. So I cleaned it & changed the battery. It was fine for a few days then it started to chirp again. I used the vacuum again. Then one day later ""chirp."" By this time I had had enough since it would especially wait until I was fast asleep before it would start chirping. I tested the battery with a multimeter. Both the new one and the old one were good. I bought a new battery for nothing. I never had the opportunity to test it in real smoke, but I never will since I got rid of it."
2,Shock Schlock,"As a newcomer to the 87th Precinct series (but not unacquainted with Mr. McBain), the first books in the series were captivating. The writing prosaic. The story line well crafted. The style refreshing. Then I jumped down to this book. What a difference. Mr. McBain seems to have fallen into the morass of ho hum writing that caters only to the shock element that unfortunately has become prevalent with so many mystery writers. Or is it the malady of losing interest in telling a good story well? Perhaps he got lazy. His overuse of vulgar language is almost comical. It's much like immature boys trying to out cuss one another. The jerky story lines are difficult to keep straight. And the stupid nun jokes by the idiotic fool detective... Why go on? I'll return to the earlier books in sequence and when it becomes apparent that Mr. McBain is no longer interested in good writing and telling a good story, I'll stop."
4,keeps you guessing,I love Ed McBain & the 87th are the best. He really keeps you guessing up to the very end of the book. A dead girl is found in the park and Carella and Brown are the detectives who try to find out who & why. The ending will surprise you. Another wonderful 87th precinct book.
4,Strange Healing,"This is an aptly told movie about how absolute strangers enter a woman's life -or vice versa- and somehow allow her to face her tragic past and find healing when family members are unable. It was a little slow at first, and I wasn't really expecting much when I decided to purchase this film because I haven't seen much by way of reviews. I was presently surprised at the heartwarming story that unfolded in this film. Judy Marte and Karen Black are magnificent actresses and feed well off of each other's characters in this movie. If you're looking for a good drama, I would definitely recommend this."
1,dont buy it,"Dont buy this book. If you want the best version, buy the first version used! This version adds very little and the pciture quality in it is terrible. Its like buying a kids coloring book! AVOID!!"
2,Buy the real albums,"I'm sorry. The music on this CD is great, and it does a fair job at showcasing some of Gilmour's better work, which is wonderful, not in a technical sense as much as in a musical one. However, with a group like Pink Floyd who were very talented at piecing together very long, yet attention grasping and fulfilling songs, it is simply unfair to try and compile half a dozen and call it thier greatest. Do yourself a huge favor and invest in either Dark Side, Wish You Were Here, Animals, then The Wall, which are certainly much more furfilling and definately worthwhile."
3,Only for new Floyd fans,"First of all, the members of Pink Floyd really hate compillation albums which leads us to the title, A Collection of Great Dance Songs (which they really ment as a joke, folks). Secondly, the only reason the diehard Floyd fan who has every album needs this is for the new version of Money. All the instruments and vocals and mixing were re-recorded by Gilmour for this release. Basically, if you can live without that - you can live with this album if you have already got everything else in the Pink Floyd cataloge."
4,Baby play yard is a good thing,"I like this. My baby gets into everything, so this is great because it makes the play yard bigger. I feel she needs to have as much room to move around as possible. The only downfall is that it makes the play yard a little more wobbly at the top. If she lifts herself up, (she hasn't at this point) it will wobble, but it's very heavy, so I feel it wouldn't topple over."
1,Returned with superyard,"I ordered this extention with the superyard as there's many reviews praised them. However, when I got it, I had to return them. There is no door on the superyard and the extention. For me (5'-3""), it's very hard to step in and out of the superyard with baby in my arms. I think the superyard without door is a tripping hazard. I think this is UNSAFE. I contacted the manufacturer, they admit the superyard does not have a door. Think twice before you order it."
4,"Flawless, no; special, yes","File this one under ""warts and all,"" because it not only marks a momentous occasion (the one time Bernstein conducted the Berlin Philharmonic) but also sums up Bernstein's incandescent, if sometimes overwrought, communication of Mahler's music. That excess emoting is one of this set's shortcomings, along with the conductor's all-too-audible (and distracting) vocalise and the ""legendary"" missed entry by the trombones at a crucial moment in the finale. I wouldn't count this as the all-around best of the recordings this orchestra has made of the Mahler Ninth (for that, look to the 1964 Barbirolli performance, which set the pace for Bernstein and Karajan to follow). But once heard, it won't be forgotten, and it sets an emotional temperature that is matched only by Bruno Walter's 1938 set."
5,Man this thing is quiet!,This is the smoothest fan I've ever owned. Shipped fast and a pretty good value. Easy to install as well.
1,MidnightIn Death,"Along with many others, I am truly disappointed by the ""mini book"". With an item like this, you need to advertise the number of pages. The idea of paying $3.99 for postage, and receiving the package with only $1.14 on the package made me feel like a real idiot. It will be a VERY LONG TIME before I order anything from AMAZON again."
4,I liked the book,"It was great, just wish it had been longer. I have really gotten into these characters, Dallas, Roarke, and Peabody. I have been trying to read all of them."
3,A publishing gimmick?,"I knew from Amazon info (showed ""Pages 96"") that this was more of a short story than a real book. But I think publshing it now was a gimmick by the publisher. The story did not add to our knowledge of Dallas and her cohorts. If you didn't run across it in the anthology it was first published in, no big deal. ""In Death"" is far beyond this now..."
4,Great! as usual,"The writing, plot, etc. were excellent as in all the ""In Death"" books, just short. I'm so used to the plot being drawn out longer, with more ""story"", that the ending came way too soon. I've read every one of the J.D. Robb books currently in paperback & I love them all ... can't wait for the next one!"
3,Midnight In Death,"I love J.D. Robb's Detective Eve Dallas' novels; but this one was a bit disappointing. The ending left me wanting more, too predictable and not the type of suspenseful, dramatic and ""gotcha"" exciting ending."
5,Why mention Saint Bob?,"Why classify this? I suppose anyone playing reggae or using elements of reggae could be deemed a second rate Bob Marley. It's catchy pop music, some of the tunes are infectious. Isn't that enough?(Does anyone know who the musicians are?)"
5,Wonderful book!,"This was recommended by several fellow students in a recent course on 'the words in red'; plausible offering to light the 'missing years'; gorgeously written from, and to, the heart. Highly recommend!"
4,??,"This album kind of confused me. It looks as if Michael Bolton was trying to transform again. But why? It's not like he wasn't selling albums. Maybe the fact that ""This Is The Time"" was the first time since ""The Hunger"" not to crack the Top 10 scared him? It's still a good album, though. ""The Best Of Love"" was a big hit, and ""Go The Distance"" went to No. 1 and is still my favorite song ever. Not his best at all, but decent nonetheless."
2,Not what I expected,"I heard ""Stop the Rock"" on the radio, and thought it had potential. I was going to buy the album it is on. Then I read all the Amazon reviews which said that ""Electro Glide in Blue"" was the best Apollo 440 CD. Well if that's the case, I can't imagine how terrible ""Getting High On Your Own Supply"" must be.I strongly recommend against buying this CD. It's not good. It's not even OK. There are no redeeming songs. There's nothing but mundane, trite and overdone beats. The lyrics are dumb and senseless, but not ""good"" dumb and senseless. The samples are repeated so much that one wonders if there's anything else to the songs.All in all it's terrible.The CD was a waste of $... and 1 hour of my life.I've never reviewed anything here (or elsewhere for that matter) before, but I felt this was worth saving someone else from."
5,Excellent product!,I bought this particular vacuum because of the customer ratings. It is really that good. I couldn't be more pleased.
5,Terrific Hoover Cannister Vaccuum,"I really like this vaccuum cleaner. I like the the power (with 3 different power levels), the edger and having the controls on the handle. I have not had problems with the size of the cannister. It lasts thru one cleaning and I empty it. I appreciate the reviews written on the Hoover upright. I was going to buy that until I read the feedback. That saved me a lot of headaches. The bagless system means never losing suction because of a tear in the bag. Wish I had bought a vaccuum like this years ago. If you want affordable power - this is it. Love it!"
4,Don't hesitate to buy,"I purchased this product after my Kenmore hose split and it would cost me more to have Kenmore (or anyone else for that matter) repair it then to buy a new vacuum cleaner. I always liked the canister model. This one has so much power and it's so light weight. The power head for carpeting does a wonderful job and the floor brush is much wider than most so it covers more floor in one sweep. So far, I haven't had it long, I can't find anything wrong with it and the price is definitely right. It's also bagless, so you save on bags."
4,"Very good vacuum, only some minor complaints","Well, I'm a housecleaner. I clean people's houses with this thing and can compare it to other vacuums; like the Dyson or Bissell. Here's what I have to say: It's a fabulous vacuum, gets up all that pet hair (ALMOST as good as the Dyson). And canister vacuums are always more flexible, less heavy, and less tedious than uprights, which is why I selected this kind of vacuum. All the buttons are within easy reach; different suction settings, turn carpet brush on/off, and so on....whereas unlike the Dyson, your buttons for carpet and floor are on the bottom of the vacuum, and you've got to bend down to switch 'em. Yes, that is far more tedious when you have to clean people's houses every day!!My only complaint about this vacuum is how small the dirt container is; it's tiny! And because it sucks up so much dirt, I'm usually emptying it about 3 times average per house I clean. I still highly recommend this vacuum though any day over a $300.00 more Dyson."
3,Good For The Money,suction 5/5picking up pet hair 5/5squeaking noise from wheels 3/5frequency of emptying vacuum canister 3/5Great for the money
1,Rotating brush stopped working after five months,"This vacuum worked well initially after purchase. However, after about five months of cleaning (and I don't clean that often!) the rotating brush or agitator stopped rotating. I took it apart, slipped the drive belt back into place -- and it worked for less than five minutes before the belt came off again!Without that brush rotating, this vacuum does not clean very well."
1,DO NOT BUY,"DO NOT BUY this vacuum.From the moment we recieved this vacuum it DID NOT WORK. It would run for less than a minute then shut off.Rather than pay the freight back to Amazon, we took it to an authorized Hoover Vacuum repair shop, who informed us that this is a very common occurence, that there are faulty Electric Hoses being installed by outsourced labor in China. The repairman stated that this is an extremely common occurence on Amazon Sales. The faulty part is the Electric Hose which is a $137. Lucky for us the repair shop fixed it for no charge, but I wonder about all those consumers that buy this piece of junk, then have the part go bad after warranty is no longer in effect. be warned."
4,"Excellent, if a little hard to maneuver","The most effective vacuum I've ever owned. But, then, my Kenmore canister, bought in 1966, likely will keep its title for longest running (and with no repairs other than duct tape) as it's still running. I've had the Hoover only a few weeks, but it is powerful, thorough in its pickup of everthing from cat hair to micro dust, and easy to operate. Like most canisters, it's a bit clunky to pull around -- and the weight that gives it substance makes that harder. Also, the one floor/rug head doesn't fit under some of my furniture. Still, these seem like minor problems in the trade-off for the good job it does. This model is bagless, which might not be an advantage -- cleaning the good-sized dirt cup and filter takes some time."
1,Fault hose kills vaccum cleaner,"While this vacuum would normally be considered great, it was faulty from the beginning and had to be returned because it would die while using it or not shut off once started. I got a replacement two weeks later. 3 months AFTER I got the replacement, it did the exact same thing, and Amazon would not accept the return since it was greater than 30 days. According to repair shop it is a faulty house."
1,Fire hazard,"The unit worked well for a couple months, and by then I thought the only flaw was a 10 pound brush motor head that on top of a 3 feet pipe feels like 100 pounds.With all the force exerted on it have loosen some of the plastic on the control handle and stuff went haywire. The brush motor stops running until you wiggle it, then spark sounds, molten plastic smell and very flaky function.I called Hoover(bad bad customer support) they say my newer S3765 model is not under recal for fire hazard(only S3755) and even though I describe these symptoms they don't seem bothered at all, tell me to go look for a repair shop to fix it under warranty. I really dont have time for all this trouble, should have put another hundred bucks and got a Dyson.Stay away."
5,Best Vacuum Ever,This is an almost perfect product. Only thing missing are a couple of small brushes I need. Would buy it again in a heart beat.
4,Good Investment,"I am very happy over all with this vacuum. It does a fantastic job. The dirt cup could be larger, other than that I was very surprised at how much dirt and cat hair I picked up the first time I used it. It is easy to push and the suction is excellent. I like the fact that I can pick it up and move it easily. I would recommend this product to anyone in fact I did, my sister bought one too."
5,Not Dyson but Works Amazing,"Very easy to empty out container and the on/off switch on the handle is great. Very strong suction, this is my second windtunnel and Im very pleased with their durability."
3,"it sucks great,but just too much trouble to dump","Great suction for a small inexpensive vacuum, but it's such a pain to empty and rinse the container every time after you vacuum. You can imagine all those flying dust and debris around your garbage can. You need to hold your breath when you do this. May be I'm just spoiled since I always had a Sears bagged canister vacuum. Overall it's a good vacuum for the price."
1,Revolving brush failed on 2 of these!!,I purchased one of these for home and one for a vacation home. The revolving brush for carpets stopped working on both of these in less than 2 years. I would NEVER buy this product again!!
1,Piece of Junk!,"I bought this vacuum for the first time over a year ago. I like the way it handled and it was fairly good at picking up dirt, but it died just under a year. I chalked it up to the fact that I have four cats. So, I bought another of the exact same model. This time it died within just two months. I took it into the Hoover suggested shop for repair, got it home and realized that it was still broken. Since I don't feel like driving across town again twice in the hopes that it will actually be repaired, I've decided to toss it and buy a different brand. What a waste of time and money!"
1,I HATE this vacuum.....,"This was the best vacuum I ever owned.....for about a month. I loved the self propelled function and the fact that all of the buttons are right on the handle. It also sucked amazingly well at first. I have had it less than a year, have changed the belt twice, you need to clean (not a small task) or exchange the filter for a fresh one after each use, the beater brush no longer spins unless you lift it off the carpet (spits the dirt around on bare floors) and the control buttons stopped working a long time ago. When I plug it in each day it is a toss up on how long I will be pushing the buttons to get it started or if it will be starting at all. There is obviously a short somewhere but we were told by customer service that we could return it to be fixed AND pay $60+ for the repair, or buy the replacement wand for $80. So...I am reading reviews and shopping for something better....again."
4,Love it!,"Great buy! Like other reviewers, I'd agree that this could be improved with a swivel hose and a better release mechanism between the hose and the rug attachment, but a side from that it works better than any vacuum I've had in the past few years ~ including a much more expensive Kenmore upright. Great suction ~ really gets the job done and I love the upholstry attachment. Plus the variable suction control works great when you want to tackle an area rug. I would definitely recommend it to any one who wants to get the job done without breaking the bank."
5,I DON'T MIND VACUUMING NOW,"I received my Hoover 3 days after ordering. Amazon is excellent to order from. So is the vacuum. Several reviews i read said the dust canister was too small. i didn't find this to be true. i had vacuumed with my old canister 2 days before my new one arrived. used the new one and with 4 cats did not find the canister filled up too quickly. but it was simply amazing tp see what it picked up that my old one didn't. floor brush works great as does the stair attachment. highly recommend to anyone wanting a canister. plus - it almost self-propels itself. GREAT VACUUM, especially for the price."
4,I like this canister vacuum,"We've had this vacuum for at least 6 years and still use it regularly. We had one incident with the handle arm, but it was covered under warranty and we had it repaired at a local vac shop that serviced hoovers. The small furniture attachment broke, but I think that was my fault for not using it as it was intended as it did work well on furniture. I don't particularly care for the dirt bin as it is messy and fills quickly, but all-in-all I like the way teh vacuum cleans and it does a good job on hardwoods and carpet. It is powerful for a canister vac, and the HEPA filter can be washed. It has kept its power since we bought it, and even though I got an upright a couple of years ago, my wife and I still use the canister for everything, leaving the upright primarily unused in the closet."
4,Agreat little machine,"I bought this vacuum for the upstairs only, but it works soooo well that I keep bringing it down to the rest of the house.. It works great on carpets and floors.. I live with kids and three dogs and it really does a great job... Had it for three years so far!! The only thing I wish, was the canister being bigger.. You do need to empty it out a lot.. So carry a garbage bag with you.. and enjoy the power this little machine gives...."
2,"Great Vacuum, Poor Electronics","I've had this vacuum for a few years now, and overall I like it. It gets the job done, and I appreciate the bagless design with HEPA filtration. That said, like others have experienced, the off/brush/suction switch components in the handle have broken, and I am looking at a minimum of $100 to repair the vacuum. I was also disappointed with the onboard attachments as the upholstery brush isn't very nice, and it is entirely lacking a circular, long-bristled brush."
2,rating Hoover,"This vacuum had good suction but that's all I can say for it. After 1 year the bottom broke and we had to keep repairing it, just ordered a new belt because it won't spin. Wheel feel off hard surface attachment. Hope to get 1 more year out of it but I don't know. I've only had it for 2 years. It could use a few improvements."
