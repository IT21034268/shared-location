3,Value for money?,"I purchased three of these cartridges because the price is so much lower than from the OEM, and other reviews appeared to suggest that this is truly a great value. I do not agree. The print quality is fine, but it ran out after just three weeks of use. I am now using the second one and I am timing that one to see how long that will last."
1,Defective - misses two lines on every page and makes a clunkging sound,"On every page printed with this toner cartridge, there are two lines missing. When printing or printer initiating, it makes a clunking sound."
4,Cheaper alternative that works,"I couldn't pass up trying this product after seeing other reviews that were positive. We are only trying our first cartridge, but so far so good. The toner looks as good as toner we brought previously."
3,it's good but...,"i bought this before, and i bought it again and again.but this time, i bought 6 of them, the packages changed, doesn't quite matter.BUT THE QUALITY OF THE PRINTINGS IS WAYYYYY WORSE THAN BEFORE.AND THE INK IS ALL AROUND THE PAPER AND HAVE LINES ON THE PRINTS ! ! ! ! !WHAT'S GOING ON???!!!"
5,OEM cartridge,I have found the best cartridges are the OEM. For the slight price difference it is worth it.
2,This is not an HP toner as advertised,"This item is advertised as original HP toner.And what I received is an aftermarket toner, in a completely different packaging than the one pictured.Buyer be aware."
3,Left marks on paper,It was ok for a day after I got it then it started leaving marks on the paper. I cant seem to get it off it is just one line all the way down the paper. I have tired cleaning it but it is still there. I am not sure if I done something wrong or if it came that way. I dont print anything off of that printer that the line wouldhurt in any way but it is still very frustrating to deal with.
3,expect a bargain,I had issues with the first cartridge I purchased; it started printing black lines. This is a replacement and the bargain price has my expectations at the same level.
1,False advertising is illegal,The image on the page is not what arrives. Instead it's a cheap knock-off that leaks badly. Buyer beware.
1,Ad lies about list price of the item,"Web page claims list price is $120.77. Retail on HP's web site: $79.99. Don't lie to us. I love the HP Laserjet and its toner. Beautiful documents. And the toner cartridges last and last. And the actual hardware: I've had 2 of these laserjet printers since 1990. Yes, I am on my 2nd one."
5,Works great,"I looked at some of the other off-brand toner cartridges, but in the end I decided the risk isn't worth it. I know the HP product will perform well and not interrupt my workflow with unnecessary printer problems. In other words, in my opinion you can't go wrong buying this product. Plus it's nice to have it delivered right to my door in a couple of days for free with Amazon Prime!"
5,"Works perfect, quite affordable!","My very penny pinching father gave me this printer, so when the cartridge ran out and I went to Staples and was informed that a new cartridge would cost $80, I just about feinted. Then I called my Dad and he informed me they could be bought on-line for a fraction of the cost. This cartridge totally fits my printer, and prints just as well as the one that came with it. Perhaps it won't last as long, only time will tell, but so far, FIVE STARS from me!"
1,Re-manufactured toner!,"Everything looked fine with the Toner until, upon further inspection, it was revealed that the Toner was actually a re-packaged item that was re-manufactured! It was not advertised as such. The thing lasted for about a month before running out. Based upon my normal usage, it should have lasted 5-6 months. In addition, the Seller is located in CHINA! Never buying from this seller again!"
1,Horrible Product,"This product has been horrible from the start. You get what you pay for! The toner has never adhered to the paper. It smudges, so you always have ink all over your hands. It's streaky and I've never gotten a good print from the cartridge."
4,Lasts a long time for home use,"I bought this toner just shy of 4 years ago and installed it as soon as I got it. Today the ink just began to fade, so I ordered another.Our printer does more printing than I'd like to see, mostly driving directions, recipes, receipts, and other websites and documents. On occasion, we will print PowerPoint presentations and other office documents.I would say we print about 10 pages per week on our printer. For kicks, I did the calculation and it comes out to 2080 pages.For the $60 every 4 years, it certainly pays for itself over any ink jet printer I've ever owned, even when printing in only black."
3,Q2612A - Quality,"After the 51st page it started to require a shake and replace of the cartridge which I didnt expect so early in the game of printing, usually I can get close to 3,000 pages before this happens because the print fades on the left side due to the toner being low. Other than that after i shook it and replaced it, it was better. I am not saying it was totally bad for the price but just caught off guard with the results."
4,Printer Cartridge,"Very good product, though it was a little pricey compared to the last time I bought them. Then again, they were still cheaper than on any other site I found."
2,Not sure how good this toner will be,"I replaced this toner for my HP Laserjet 1020 today although I ordered it a few weeks ago. All seemed to be ok, but the printer rang/screeched when a document was sent to print. I figured I could live with that, but then it started jamming the printer now and again. Still, I need this printer for my business and will see how it goes down the line. I don't want to have to go out to a retail store and pay premium....but my business comes first. Wonder if others have experienced this problem. I know the price is extraordinarily low, but I went by all the reviews and felt I was safe to order."
2,HP profit center,"Last 12A cartridge leaked toner. Not good. Didn't last very long, either, though that's just more perception than anything else. If there was a God, He'd introduce the concept of competition into the toner cartridge business... best way to reduce the high costs, without resorting to ""remanufactured"" cartridges.Of course, HP simply will respond as it currently does by introducing a new cartridge design with every different printer it makes, an infuriating practice. Pretty soon the ""wall"" of different HP cartridges available at your friendly neighborhood computer/office store will grow to rival the Great Wall of China in dimensions."
2,Generic,"This product is listed as ""HP 12A Toner Cartridge""...I chose this one because I wanted the name brand. However, the product is actually the generic version. It seems to work okay for now. But definitely false advertisement."
2,Mediocre experience,"I went with this toner cartridge based on the great reviews. However, maybe it was just a unique incident, but the toner cartridge I received did not have a solid working drum. It could print out a solid black page fine, but normal text came out uneven. And yes, I shook the toner cartridge plenty of times to spread the toner. The toner looks to be fine. I ended up having to transfer the toner back to the original HP cartridge and I'm back in action. I did not contact customer support since I could not afford to be without a working printer for more than a day."
1,You get what you pay for,"I love buying things from amazon whenever I can but I must say buying toner cartridges isn't easy. It's very easy to be deceived because of how things are pictured or worded. I actually thought I was buying a genuine HP product, which I always do when it comes to printers/copiers. I should have known when I saw I could buy 4 cartridges for the price of 1. The description made me believe that what I was getting a genuine HP product. Well let me tell you that is NOT what I got! When I can acutally get the cartridge to print...the black color is good. I have to stop about every 30 pages, take the cartridge out and shake the toner around otherwise it acts like it's out of toner...this started happening after I printed the first few pages. Needless to say I now have toner everywhere it doesn't belong and when I do print I get dirty copies. Lucky me I have 3 more cartridges to go."
2,I agree with the review about the BAD BATTERY,"ALL YOU PEOPLE WHO LIKE TO KEEP THEIR MOUTHS CLEAN!!READ THISPROS - GOOD DESIGN. BRUSHES ARE EXCELLENT AND THEY CLEAN WELLCONS - Battery will lose its life after a month or so. And the brushes, while relatively new, will keep snapping off the brushhead while you're brushing. The replacement brushes are very expensive - about 10 bucks for two. Customer service is almsot nonexistent.BUY something else!!"
1,Go Ahead...Make Their Day,"If you want to buy an Animals CD that does not contain ""House Of The Rising Sun"" or ""We Gotta Get Out Of This Place"", and sounds like it was recorded on a portable cassette recorder in an unfinished basement by Beavis and Butthead on acid then by all means---knock yourself out."
5,The Best of the Sixties!!,"I'm glad to see that the world's music can still be available at the click of a mouse. Eric Burton's music was by far outstanding back in the day. This CD was reproduced perfectly and probably better than what we listened to on the radio. Don't hesitate to purchased this CD. It ""Won't Let You Down""."
3,Not shrimp chips,"Disappointing. More a salty flavor than shrimp. Made from wheat, not a rice cracker."
3,"Very comfortable, but...","Ordered this to remedy our stiff, uncomfortable mattress.Though we measured our queen mattress precisely, and this product claimed to come in a size (measured in inches, not according to type such as queen, king, etc.) that matched our mattress exactly, our memory foam mattress topper arrived and was about 2.5 inches too small all the way around.We placed it in the center of our mattress and are now sleeping in the center of the bed...lol. Very comfortable, but also irritating to spend money on a product that doesn't arrive as promised.And yes, as a previous reviewer mentioned, there is a chemical smell to the memory foam in the beginning. I found it to be very tolerable, but some might be bothered by it."
4,A great deal,"I had concerns when I took it out of the box and it was flat, but it snapped into shape in a few hours at room temperature. I sleep great on it! It is the perfect thickness and really makes a difference in my sleep. The only downside is the 2 inch gap it has on the length on my queen size mattress. Centering it solves the problem, but the ad says it completely covers the matress. I would recommend it for sure."
5,"3"" memory topper","I had my doubts when it arrived squinched in a carton, but poof! It expanded into a nice square topper and is absolutely wonderful to sleep on."
3,3 inch Memory Foam Mattress,I had purchased the same size for about the same price from JC Penny. The JCPenny product was better. But this product is very good. And less expensive than a TempuPedic mattress :)
4,Best Sleep in Years,I wish I had purchased this product years ago. Finally a sound sleep. No tossing and turning to get a good night's rest.
2,A lot of smell and very soft.,"I left this to air out in my garage for a few weeks but it still smells. Also, it is very soft. Some memory foams are much firmer than this type. If you like sleepy on soft, toxic smelling stuff than this is for you."
2,Comfy but no Help,"Love the way it feels, but it loses the stiffness and ""memory"" very quickly. I got this in May and 6 weeks later it was feeling very soft and loose - not at all like the first few weeks. Now 6 months later, just feels like an extra pad. I slept good for the first week and then felt the same issues in my back and neck as before. I actually think my neck pain is worse. It does feel comfy when you get into bed, but not a good fix for pain and tossing/turning issues. Not worth the investment."
1,"great quality, hurt muscles i never knew i had","great quality, thick soft dense.however, memory foam and i do not get along - like lying down on sand or clay, gives but not springy.after lying on it an hour, i hurt muscles i never knew i had, had to return it"
2,Nit Locator Spray,This made more of a mess than anything. It highlighted the nits...but it made a complete mess. I will not use it again.
4,Meant to be a response to critics,"The creationist case can be better stated, [Mark Eastman for instance] but this book is more of a response to evolutionists attack on creationists. It does bring up faults in evolution that leading evolutionists such as Stephen Gould admit. For instance, Gould has acknowledge the lack of transistional forms, and problems with the idea of transistional species. The quotes at the end of the book, by evolutionists themselves say it all."
1,Poor durability,"Very comfortable, but not a good value. Begins to shred, and seams seperate after 10 to 15 washings."
2,"Been There, Seen That...","Regardless of the good or bad points of the four films in this set, any fan of old movies probably already has these titles in their collection. If 20th Century-Fox wanted to release some religious/historical epics this year, why not choose ESTHER AND THE KING with Joan Collins, THE EGYPTIAN with Victor Mature, or THE LAST DAYS OF SODOM & GOMORRAH with Stewart Granger? I suppose from the studio's point of view it makes sense to keep going with a sure thing, but I find it annoying that they keep repackaging movies that have already been out on DVD."
3,Low-Rate Transfer,"This DVD version is definitely not restored. I had to crank the volume to hear the audio and the picture is grainy. Another thing--and I don't know the proper term--is that the background ""jumps."" It is like the film is two-layered, with things in the foreground steady, while things in the background, like curtains on windows, jerk and jump. If anyone is familiar with a term for this effect--and I've seen it on other poor DVD transfers of classic movies--please let me know.The movie studio ID is missing from the front of the picture, like a bootleg copy. I see the ""MGM"" logo in the fine print with the copyright. Was MGM the studio that produced this? Above the movie title is ""Favorite Films."" I've never heard of that company. Can anyone enlighten me with some background?I wouldn't pay much for this copy. Maybe someday a quality restoration will be done of this charming sleeper."
2,Eye Caution: Too Out Of Focus For The Eyes,"This Is a very good comedy,Hopefully someone will put out a version you can watch. This copy is so out of focus It's really hard to watch. But It's so well done I try to get thru It this way. Won't somebody please, please Help Me."
3,great product,I received my box set extremly fast however the one problem i had was that the packaging being a plastic box set containing the whole series was badly broken and pieces of it were all over the packaging. When you pay this much for an item that is a collectors edition it is frustrating to get it that way.otherwise the price was good and the speed of the item was amazing.
1,half the discs don't work!!!,"I am a huge fan of TNG and I owned all of the individual seasons on DVD. Some years ago, I had a house fire and lost them all. I thought buying this package would be a quick way to re-establish my collection. But half of the discs wont even play in my dvd player! My dvd player is about one year old (this post is in 2011) so I see no reason why these discs should not work, and yet, I cannot watch most of the latter seasons because the discs are unplayable. I have a region one player and the discs are formatted for region one. They will play for about ten minutes (four episodes on each disc) and then the DVD player shows a screan saying ""disc is unplayable."" Additionally, Paramount offers no replacement discs for the malfunctioning ones. DO NOT BUY THIS SET!!! THE DISCS WILL NOT PLAY IN YOUR DVD PLAYER"
4,Nerd Heaven!,"Love this set! I've been waiting for years to get Next Gen and I'm glad I waited. The overall quality is great, though there are a few early episodes that look like straight from video transfers....The special features are a Trekkers delight, tons of behind the scenes info and rarely seen interviews.If you love Next Gen - buy this set!"
3,Crappy Packaging,This is the worst packaging of any DVD collection I have ever seen. Details on this horrid packaging job can be found in many of the other reviews.
5,As advertised,I'm a long time Star Trek fan and continue to enjoy the series. TNG runs a close second to TOS. Fun to watch again...
5,star trek TNG Zen,"Best DVD box set I have ever bought, for TNG or star trek fans well worth the money. I've had it for a month so far and I'm still on season one. If your pondering whether to its worth the money it is, you will be enjoying this for months to come!"
1,Badly manufactured discs - not worth the money,"We are Star Trek fanatics, so this isn't a review of the content - it's a review of this particular product. I would concur with many of the negative things others have said about the shoddy quality of packaging, etc. but would add that we found nearly every disc to be unplayable. We would be able to see one episode, tops, then it would freeze on us and refuse to read the rest. Since our player works fine on other discs, I suspect that the poor quality of the discs is to blame. NOT WORTH THE MONEY, don't be sucked into buying this like we were!"
2,Great series in terrible packaging,"This is a wonderful series, but unfortunately the packaging for the product severely diminishes the overall value of the product. The trays are cheap, fall apart easily and don't hold or protect the discs very well. Best to buy a cd holder for all the discs. There are no descriptions of the episodes, and the only references are the episode titles which are printed on the discs themselves. So, if you're looking for a particular episode, you'll have to sift through the entire collection. It's a very disappointing re-packaging of the television series."
3,"Ok, but not great","Received the set in damaged condition. It was obvious that the cases holding the DVD's were damaged BEFORE they were shrink wrapped, leading me to believe I was intentionally shipped damaged goods. The DVD's themselves have all worked so far, so at least I have the series. The shipper ""Bookgrovemedia"" gave me a $20 credit to keep the set. My other option with them was to return the set for a refund, which would have left me without the set at all. Overall, I would be careful about purshasing from this vendor."
2,Star Trek NG Review,"The product arrived ""somewhat"" as promised - neither early nor late. The discs were poor-to-moderate quality duplicates, shipped from China. Some discs were difficult to decode or read. The box set that arrived was not the box set that is advertised on Amazon."
2,star trek tng complete series,am having difficulty with some of the discs. about half of them will not play and about a third that will play skip or stop. i love star trek but the disc quality is realy poor.
1,"One of the best series ever made, but horrible packaging.","I'm really disappointed in Paramont for releasing this set in such a crappy box. I really wanted to see something great for TNG 20, but I was greatly let down. I've seen this box set in person and can vouch for how crappy the box is made. I will not buy this until it has been put into a better box that isn't really over priced. I agree with other posters, I believe that this will be coming to Blu-Ray within a couple of years. I'll wait for that.While I love this series, I will refuse to buy this crappy box."
5,It's wonderful!,"This is a discontinued product, so imagine my surprise when I was able to find quantities of it. It shipped as expected and was everything I remember it being, thanks Amazon!"
1,RJ is a fat worthless idiot like Dr. Phil,"Randy Jackson is the most annoying person on TV. While Simon is entertaining and Paula is cute, Randy is a complete buffoon. This book was written with one thing on his mind... money. This book has no inside info on the entertainment industry and has no insight for those seeking fame and fortune as entertainers. Instead what we have is an egotistical jerk who brags about his success while never admitting he doesn't do anything. If you admire a man who helped bring us the likes of Mariah Carey and NSYNC, go ahead and waste your money because you're an idiot too."
1,sh*t sandwich,Summary: Do you have it? Well Elvis had it.gee thanks -that was worth $12...notThis book does NOT have it
3,A Nice Addition for Wireless G Too!,"I had a few problems with installation...instructions could be better, however, once installed on a Toshiba, it has continued to work ok. On the other hand, had to reinstall a couple of times on an HP. It also has limited range using Wireless G...about 40-45 feet."
1,Doesn't work on my shuttle computer,"I bought this adapter after buying a new D link router which would not work with old D link adapters I had. I spent two months trying to install this adapter on my Shuttle sp35. After many calls to D link, downloading drivers and software, I broke down and hardwired with a long ethernet cable. I wish that D link's adapters worked as good as my new HP laptop. It connects instantly with my new router."
3,Disconnects everytime a usb device is unplugged,"This installed OK and after an update worked in Vista. The connection speed is pretty good most of the time. However, everytime any usb device is disconnected (even using Window's 'Safely Remove Hardware' applet), I lose connection to my DLink Wireless Xtreme N router. I have to either disable/enable the device in Device Manager, or restart the computer. I've tried connecting directy to a USB port and though a USB hub - same result. Software/firmware updates to the router haven't resolved this."
2,"Just don't hibernate or plug in other device, or else...","Works great...until you hibernate. Then you have to unplug and plug several times before it works again. Also, I plug in my Canon camera and it stops being able to access the net. Stay away."
1,Beware if you have 64-bit Vista!,"What they don't tell you is that they only make drivers for 64-bit Vista for the Revision B and C versions of the adapter, and apparently there is no way (at least that I've been able to find) to order a specific revision. Plus D-Link's policy is to not do exchanges if you have the wrong revision; they only do exchanges if an item is broken - I called D-Link to try and find out and had to explain the problem THREE times before they told me I couldn't trade it. I ordered one through a local business who didn't know about the different revisions, got an A, and they can't return it or order a specific revision. Another store I called told me they couldn't order a specific revision, either.So if you have Vista, I'd only recommend purchasing if you have the 32-bit. I'm now looking for an adapter I can use with a Motorola SB5101 and a D-Link DIR-615 that I can find 64-bit Vista drivers for without having to worry about getting the right revision of the adapter."
2,"Faster than built-in wireless but less reliable, drops out at times","The D-link DWA-130 Wireless N USB Adapter was fairly simple to set up, and showed higher data capacity (58Mbps) versus (54Mbps), that of the built-in wireless connection on my old Windows XP SP3 Compaq 4000 ; but it is less reliable. It loses connection at times and has to be re-connected. Not worth the trouble for the slight increase in data capacity of the wireless connection."
3,DWA-130 Wireless adapter,"For the most part this adapter has a good signal connectivity, however it takes along time when starting windows to get a connection and frequently the connection gets lost."
5,Good Buy,"I read up on many adapters before purchasing this one. It has worked consistently on my old Dell Latitude laptop running Windows XP. I am connected as we speak at 54 Mbps. I keep it plugged into the laptop at all times.I don't use the software that came with it, as I don't like a lot of software open."
2,Not as faster connection as it promesed to be,"It really isn't what I was expecting. I have a four-year-old laptop with a wi-fi card that only supports g protocol, so I thought that buying this product I was going to upgrade my computer making its connection to the internet faster because I'm using an N protocol router. N protocol allows you to connect as fast as 300 Mbps, but using this D-Link device the computer only manage to connect at 150 Mbps. I checked the the setup and the and the instructuons, but I didn't find anything helpful. At the end, I've got a sort of faster connection, but not as fast as I thought it would be. It'll probably work with a newer computer, not with mine."
1,Are you out of your mind - this is one of the Manson Murderers?,This is as crazy as you selling that child porn tape? Do you not realize this guy murdered people for Charles Manson.I'm beginning to lose respect for Amazon.This is disgusting.
4,A great `difficult third` album,"Do not believe that other reviewer, he doesn't know what he's talking about! This is another great album from Dan Reed and co. Slam is my favorite DRN album, but this one is almost as good - and much better than the first album. Funky, groovy, poppy and melodic... in other words good music."
1,Worst Textbook series EVER,"I took German for a semester in college with this series and it is terrible. The instructions in the text are in German from the start and many of the words I didn't know weren't in the text's glossary. My wife is currently taking the second semester of German at the same university and she is livid with this text. She has found countless spelling, grammar and other errors throughout the text. She spends more time looking up words than actually learning German. If your institution is limited to this series for its German classes, I am sorry. Talk to the heads of the department and ask for an alternative. It's that bad."
5,60 seconds and you're hired,"This is the BEST book to read before you look for a job!! Guaranteed you will make more money, and sound and look better, and get that job!! I have used these techniques with good success."
3,Not great but ok,"This was just ok - not a great flavor, think I'll try adding vanilla when I use again. Really quick and easy though. If you need frosting in a hurry it's probably acceptable."
4,Oldie but goodie!,"This is one of my favorite Woody Harrelson characters... He really proved he could act in this one! Courtney Love, on the other hand... Looks like she is playing herself."
4,Good Content - Needs Better Layout,The material is explained well and has many examples. The problem is the examples are printed so small you often need a magnifying glass to read them.
4,Best of its type under US$40,"I use this book for classes and workshops that I teach. It is quite simply the best book of its type for under US$40. There are a couple of excellent titles from Wrox that deliver similar information, but they miss this price point.Castro's book comes in at just under 500 pages, which is as succinct as one could hope to get with the level of detail that she reaches.It does an excellent job of not only covering the most basic material but of touching on questions that will arise for intermediate web development students exploring logical ""next steps"" of web technology learning."
5,Greatest HTML book ever written,This book is totally the bible of HTML books. I use it as a reference guide whenever I need it...there probably hasn't been a page i havent used. The author makes it so easy to understand the often confusing world of HTML with plenty of examples and well written explanations. A must-buy for beginner-intermediate web designers.
3,There has got to be a better book...,"I bought this book because it is the #1 best-selling book on HTML and it seemed to contain all of the content that I am looking for. In reading through the book,I find that 1) the explanations are not always clear or concise 2) I find myself skipping sections because it is annoying to read because the text-figure layout is poor and 3) the author consistently refers to other book sections 50+ pages ahead of the current reading as explanation.This book is probably best as a reference, not as a manual."
4,detailed trANSLATION,"this translation, because of its age, contains details and expressions from the literal Russian. It is quite informative. Most expressions and turns of phrase are accurate. It is better than many of the current ""literary adaptations"" of this play."
3,Worth looking at.,"Tasteful, explicit and informative enough. But would have preferred more positions with out the props and equipment being used. Seemed a bit contrived."
3,A powerful presence,"Few actors filled the screen like Lancaster. His voice and physicality were his trademarks. He changed the way Hollywood did business and stars wielded their power.His social conscience was fascinaing to watch. This bio provides a starting point for the interested fan, but many questions raised by the author go without answers, evidence, supporting opinion or verification. Lancaster chastised Kirk Douglas for his kiss and tell writings, and perhaps that is a reason why at the end of this bio, we wish for more."
4,I would buy this product again,I purchased this dehumidifier because I live on the coast and we get approximately 100 inches of rain a year. Mold and moisture accumulation are big concerns. This product is very effective at pulling the excess moisture from the air and drying the air.
4,my review,best point is quiet operation. does an excellent job of removing humidity. easy to maneuver.
4,what you see is what you get,Dehumidifier works well. Does turn off before overflow. Is very quiet even on high.
1,"Product died, poor customer service","I liked this dehumidifier fine for the four months that it worked -- then it died, despite me keeping the filter and the unit meticulously clean. Soleus told me to send it back (at my own cost) and they'd replace it. I was a bit disgruntled at this extra cost, so I asked why Soleus couldn't pay the return shipping. The customer service rep said that if I had called within a ""reasonable time,"" Soleus would have paid. I asked her to explain how there could be a reasonable time for a breakdown since presumably a well-made product wouldn't break down at all. From that point on, she ignored my questions, quoted the warrantee at me, and got progressively ruder. All three reps I spoke with were equally rude, and they flat out refused to let me speak with a manager, telling me that their managers don't speak to customers! I'm sending the unit back for a replacement, but I will never purchase anything from Soleus again on the basis of their poor customer service."
1,Lost its charge after only 18 months,"Bought this unit in January 08. Used it only in winter months and now in December 11 unit has lost it's freon charge. Soleus customer service is totally worthless, would not help to mitigate the cost. This unit probably has only run for less than 400 hours."
4,Soleus Air Dehumidifier--Great,"We needed a new dehumidifier and this one was perfect. It takes up less space, is light weight, and extremely quiet. Sometimes I have to check to see if it's really on. Having wheels on it makes it much easier to move around the room. Great product. Couldn't be happier."
5,A good deal for good operating machine,"Not knowing anything about how to choose a good dehumidifier I used Amazon's reviews to make my decision to purchase this item. The item works as good as all the previous reviewers indicated. It operates very quietly, it removes moisture from my 30' x 25' basement well (the floors are no longer damp/wet), and shuts off when the tank is full, which is usually around 8-hours of running time. Simply stated, I definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a good dehumidifier."
1,POS,"THIS P.O.S. IS JUNK. THE 1ST ONE FAILED 4 DAYS AFTER PURCHASE. REPLACEMENT FAILED OUT OF THE BOX. THEIR CUSTOMER SERVICE CLAIMED ""NO PROBLEMS WITH THIS MODEL, NEVER"" AFTER FURTHER PRESSING, ""IT'S RARELY A PROBLEM. FORTUNATELY I DID BUY FROM AMAZON. HOPING TO GET MY $ BACK."
2,Broken after two summers,Product worked well but does not last. I only used it for about four months in the summer. This is my third summer and it quit working.
1,DO NOT BUY THIS,"Well, I too wanted a quiet dehudifier. Is that too much to ask? This unit is silent, but it does not collect a drop of water. the noiser units that I have tried collect lots of water, but they sound like a helicopter is operating in my basement, and the noise would carry throughout the house. I worked with Soleus , they even RMA'd the original, and I'm on the 2nd unit, but I can not reccomend this unit. Maybe if i lived in a more humid area, such as the deep south, it would be useful, but the unit did not work in my chicago land basement.Also, a quick note on working with soleus customer service - obviously this company does not have a service department like DELL or some other large company. CS consists of 1-2 people, so it is not all that convenient.Can somebody reccomed a dehudifier that:collects water!has a hose attachment optionis pretty quiet (I'm not asking for silent!)costs less than $200?"
4,Simple Guide,Meditation is new to me. I've been kind of doing my own thing and meditating the way I imagined you should do it without any direction (I had in mind that the point was to get away from direction!). I ran across this small book at Whole Foods and am happy to say that I would recommend it as a straightforward guide to what meditation is and different ways to practice it. Within the first 20 pages or so you'll get the basics and be ready to get going.
3,Nice But the Weakest of the Mojo Chess Compilations,Maybe it's because this is the broadest titled one - they even repeat tracks from other collections. The selected tracks are all nice professional efforts but not as great as the others in the series - especially with the repeats. Pick this one up last.
1,Don't waste your money,"I bought the Soleus FSD-40B 16"" fan in Febuary of 2005 and the fan did't move the air much even on top speed. The fan stopped working in July of 2005 and I could not get Soleus to respond to any of my calls or emails for a replacement. Do yourself a favor and buy something else..."
2,"Is this supposed to be a ""Cooling"" Fan?","I recently purchased this fan to cool my bedroom & have even the slightest noise while I sleep. Well, I guess the fact that the fan does not make a sound isn't a problem, even though that was one of the things I was looking for. The actual cooling part is horrible!!! The fastest speed on this fan is the slowest speed on all the other fans I've owned! I can barely feel it when I'm lying in bed. And the slowest speed is just a joke! I think I would get cooled off more by someone blowing on me!I would return it if I didn't have to take it all apart and fit it into the box, and pay for shipping!"
3,Cost Savings Fan,"I had read the reviews but I ordered it anyway. The fan is quiet, so that's a plus. The manual is almost useless so I assembled it without the manual. I did buy 1-inch long bolts to fasten the base. I had to loosen a large screw in order to tip the fan blade housing. Attaching the blade housing unit (over the blade) was a chore because they provide only one screw. So I had to use a large screw driver to tip the housing into the track. (How much did they save by eliminating metal retainer clips?)It does have a remote. I wonder how long this unit will last?"
2,Aircraft jet engine.,"I give it a two because it does blow.I wanted a ""quiet"" fan for my bedroom. And based on at least one other review that said the fan was super quiet, I purchased this fan. I had an old fan that was starting to click and whine a bit. But you could hardly hear the fan portion.This thing is like an F3 tornado with the loud wind noise.It has other settings where it cycles to a lower speed then cycles to a higher speed continuously. I guess to simulate the fan rotating. But all it does is wind up being annoying.If I could cycle the thing down to 1/4th the speed that it goes at on ""low"" I would be a cappy hamper. As it is, I am going to take it to my shop and use it there.When Lowes brings out the summer stuff, I will actually try one before I buy one to make sure I get what I am aiming for.If you need a fan that can blow you down 40' away, then by all means buy this fan. If you want to use it in your bedroom, only buy it if you are deaf."
3,Fair Quality Fair price...,"Fan has wonderful air flow, but the cage around the fan is loose because of a cheap plastic nut that holds it on. Also the remote could use alot of work! First it is not the same remote that is pictured, second it is VERY poor quality, worked for 1 week....but overall you get what you pay for, and If you are looking for a cheap fan with a remote this might be for you!"
3,Got a Tacky Feeling,"The build is not solid and got a tacky feel. It is manufactured in China.No vibration I Could see, Make the usual noise the fan makes when in High Speed."
4,Floor Fan,"The fan that I purchased was not quite what I wanted, it is only 16"" wide and though it does the job of cooling was disappointed. The width of the fan was my mistake not the fan company. They could use a different interpreter to write the instruction manual, one has to see what is written and then try to figure out what the actual meaning is.I also ordered it for two day delivery and paid accordingly, I placed my order on Tuesday, it was available to UPS on Friday morning,3:00AM. However no delivery was made until the following Monday, the driver claimed that he attempted to deliver on Friday PM but there was nobody home. I knew that UPS had it on their truck so waited on my balcony where I have a clear view of the complex entrance and never saw a UPS truck. I have DSL service on my phone and no attempt to contact me was made although UPS claims that they did."
3,"Look, they're not young guys anymore.","I can't stand hearing people complain about how The Moody Blues ""sold out"". They just grew up. While this obviously isn't their best album, it certainly isn't all filler as most people would have you believe. I think The Moody Blues as a band have simply parted with the worldly prophetic style and moved on to what they consider important to them now. It's just a natural tendency for a long running band to evolve. Get over it."
2,The Eragon of its day,"Can I wholeheartedly recommend this book? Of course not. But, reading it back in the late eighties, I was fresh off ofDragonlance(probably waiting for the next book in the series to come out, actually) and I hadn't readThe Lord of the Rings, yet, so I wasn't aware of how derivative this series was. For a fantasy-starved voracious reader who'd already racked up all the overdue library fines I could take, finding this book in a ""give-away"" pile of other mass market paperbacks was like a godsend. This book was basically theEragonof its day. A total hack rip-off of Tolkien, but for a young teen who didn't know better, it totally satisfied the itch for epic adventure.The Warrow are basically slimmer, shoe-wearing, jewel-eyed Hobbits with archery skills. Tuck, used to a quiet life in his small Warrow village, gets drawn in to a quest to fight the oncoming darkness and unnatural winter spreading over the land.Approach this like the fan-fiction that it is, and it's not a bad read."
4,"""Ne le dis à personne""","Eight years ago, a doctor's wife was savagely murdered. But today, he received an email that shows her alive and well. How can that be?This is a tense who-dun-it and who-dun-what that kept me guessing the whole time. The plot is very complex and there are too many characters to keep track of, so many that I couldn't tell the good guys from the bad guys most of the time. It's in French or English; I tried both and thought the original French audio was much better. The acting is uniformly fine. Kristin Scott Thomas, who speaks French beautifully, is listed as a star but has only a small and unnecessary role.The excitement and thrills kept me on the edge of my seat, even though I wasn't always sure what was going on. (Watching it a second time helped me sort things out and it was still a fun ride). Lots of violence. Recommended."
4,"Review of the movie ""Tell No One""","This French-language movie of American author Harlan Coben's mystery novel is excellent and follows the book's plot closely. My only regret is that it is in French and will not be seen by many of Coben's fans. I have heard rumors that an American version of this story may be in the works. The cast is excellent, but unknown to Americans,except for Kristin Scott Thomas. Yes, the same actress who played the very English Lady Sylvia in ""Gosford Park"", speaks fluent French. This film is a must-see for Harlan Coben readers like myself, even if you have to get used to reading English subtitles."
5,"True Love Story filled with Mystery, Secrets and bit of Comedy! Must own!","**SPOILERS** I thought this film was awesome. It had everything SO many films today do not...A Happy Ending :) I thought the character of Bruno added a bit of Comedy and was a nice touch. To me, it was refreshing and while at times tense it had a certain lightness to it. I went into this film expecting yet another disappointment. What I got was a True Romantic film that showed Love can conquer all and Vengeance can really cost a very steep price! This film is also quite affordable here on Amazon and worth the price. Watch it with your Special someone :)"
4,Dodging a bullet-Love Lost & Returned,"I confess that I decided to rent this because Kristin is an incredible actress. However, she has a small part in this, but I still enjoyed the story. The Blu-Ray was watched on a 50"" Plasma and LG BH200 player. The picture is crisp throughout, but not perfect 4/5. Sound was adequate, and much of the film is dialogue driven-4/5.This story is a tale of an immense and loss experienced by the main character, for 8 years, only to find out that his wife is not dead, afterall. The viewers are led through a story, that has many twists and turns, especially at the end. Performances are engaging, though the main character seemed to lack emotional depth as should be experienced, by a husband who is grieving for this long. I liked the unexpected story developments and I was unaware that it was based on Harlan Coban's book. The English music in the French film was a little strange, but added some familiarity for me, as I don't speak French. Definitely worth a rent!"
5,So Much Better Than The Book,Great film. Many twist. So glad the director edited out all the unnecessary small-minded stereotypes that were included in the book from which the film was made.
5,Absolute knockout,"This movie will leave you breathless. It is a faced-paced mystery/drama that will keep you on the edge of your seat. Very well done. Note: I never give away the plot in any of my reviews, in case you are wondering."
4,Great Pillows Wrong Color,"The pillows were very pretty, and I especially liked that they were a solid color. Unfortunately, they were not truly a wedgewood blue color. They were much deeper in color (almost a blue/purple shade), so I had to send them back as they just did not fit in with my current color scheme."
2,litmus paper,"Don't buy it. Useless. No refernece material. I guess it works couldn't tell there was no chart included with the paper to compare to. I don't work with this stuff everyday so didn't do me much good. The only posative thing was it was cheap, but i didn;t get much either."
1,"Low Budget, Poorly Made",I too found it difficult to watch the complete movie because it was so poorly made. After about 30 minutes I gave up.
2,Big Yawn!,"I gave this DVD 2 stars because it was well done, very classy and had real couples. And second cause it aroused my wife, she likes soft porn. BUT, it showed me NOTHING new. I'm only 26 years old, wife same age, and I've been doing those positions since I was like 20 yrs old. I guess if you're just used to the old missionary position and don't really have a sexual imagination, then this is the video for you!But if you have an imagination and try different positions, then don't purchase this, save your money. I'm going to exchange this in search of a video that shows me a few things that I don't know. I'll admit that I don't know everything, who does?"
3,This is alright,This is not bad there are some positions that are new but on the whole the positions are all already known. The positions that are new i really too difficult for any one to get. what the video could have achieved was some amount of foreplay that the kama sutra talks about not just the positions.
4,Managing Maintenance Shutdowns and Outages,"This is a very good Turnaround book. I particularly like the scope development and validation section. Other interesting features correspond to the master scheduling sections as related to different phases of the turnaround.It would have been good if presented more details about the phases of the Turnaround Management Process.The review of project management theory is okay. However, I would stress the project management concepts as applied to maintenance work."
5,A really fun book,"Length:: 0:15 MinsThis book is incredibly fun if you're into fantasy cartooning.Ben Caldwell has filled the pages with sketches and tips to drawing all sorts of fantasy characters, ranging from heroes, villains, fairies to beasts. The tips given are not just on drawing, but also on developing characteristics and personality into them. That's character design. He talks about everything, from the hair, eye shadows, wrinkles, costumes, postures, smiles and basically anything that you can see.There's a companion website to the book called Action Cartooning. You can find more art, comics and a community forum.(More pictures are available on my blog. Just visit my Amazon profile for the link.)"
1,GAME DOES NOT SAVE,I really wish I had read these reviews before I purchased this game. Lesson learned the hard way. This game WILL NOT SAVE. DO NOT RECOMMEND.
2,BORING MAJOR,I am a huge rugrat fan but this is just horrible.Try a monkey ball game or frogger i love tak and the power of juju.DONT GET RUGRATS GO WILD.UNLESS YOUR 8 or under!!!!! writen by an eleven year old
3,"Was a Big Deal Back Then, But Now, Dated.","Viewed: 10/08Rate: 610/08: Crossfire can be credited as being the first picture to tackle ""hate crime"" issue, and it works for me. The performances by the cast aren't so bad, and I thought Robert Young stood out the most with his honest, sincere portrayal of a man who understands the problem. His speech to Leroy was the most powerful. Other than that, there isn't much to find in Crossfire, and the story remains flat. There is a clever trick in how the detective got the killer trapped, and I enjoyed that one. There is a minimal amount of film noir about Crossfire. How the character Gloria Grahame's Ginny was set up is silly to me because I was annoyed with her refusal to cooperate with the detective because really what's there to lose after all? All in all, Crossfire is an all right film, nothing more or less."
5,Muscle toning,"I bought the video for my Mom for Christmas, and we've enjoyed it. The video may not be the most ""professionally"" produced, but what does it matter? Once you learn how to do the exercises you don't even have to watch the people do them! In fact, you don't have to watch the video at all. You could do them on your own.Mom and I have not noticed a weight loss, but our abs are more firm and our muscles are being toned. If nothing else, the video is a GREAT relaxer, and it has been a very good investment for us."
1,WORSE PRODUCT OF ANY PRODUCT EVER SOLD,"THIS IS THE BIGGEST PIECE OF JUNK ON THE MARKET. AS FOOLS DO I PURCHASED 3 IN A ROW ALL I A 12 MO PERIOD. I COULD GET;; NO RETURNS, NO REPAIRS. WHAT I DIDNT LIKE WAS TO PICK UP CAT POO SO I KEPT GOING LIKE FOOLS DO. WILL I HAVE ACTUALLY GIVEN UP ON LITTR MAID AND WENT TO ANOTHER SYSTEM THAT WORKS PERFECTLY. I AM RETIRED AND HAVE NOTHING ELSE TO DO SO IF THERE ARE A COUPLE HUNDRED THOUSAND CUSTOMERS OUT THERE I WILL SPONSOR A CLASS ACTION LAW SUITE AGAINST THIS FRAUD OF OUR TIME, MONEY,LitterMaid LME9000 Elite Mega Advanced Automatic Self-Cleaning Litter BoxAND CATS. CONTACT MY FACE BOOK DANNY W OKEEFE. NOW THAT WOULD BE FUN AND PROVIDE A COMMUNITY SERVICE."
1,Save your money,"I had big hopes when I bought this box as it is advertised for use in multiple cat households. I have two mature cats and trying to keep a litter box clean and odor-free as possible is a daily job. I am really disappointed in the performance if this box as it has difficulties/failures in disposing of cat urine clumps. I've used 3 different types of ""premium clumping"" litter as required by the manufacturer and the urine clumps many times rotate vertical going up the ramp to the storage container and get stuck to the plow/comb. Either that or if the clump is large, the drive motor is not powerful enough and the the box gives up trying to evacuate the clump. I'm spending just as much time or more cleaning this box on a daily basis as I did with the traditional manual cat box. I've had this box for a month now and I'm going to clean it out this weekend for the last time and go back to the traditional manual cat box. The self-cleaning box will be in my next garage sale."
1,I'VE HAD 6 IN 3 YRS!,"Every single one I've purchased eventully will not stop raking. I've contacted the company several times ( horrible customer service ) and they tell me how to reset it, but inevitably that doesn't work after awhile. Like so many of the other reviewers, I feel like they don't care that their product gets worse with each ""improvement."" We need a sturdy, easy to empty machine!"
1,A waste of money!,"I originally gave this a rave review. But then the wheel on the rake broke after 3 months, the rake never really worked well enough to scoop all the poop out and it felt like trying to scrape dried up cement from the bottom of the litterbox all the time. I've tried getting a replacement rake from the company, even calling and emailing them. They don't have it at all, they don't know where I could get one but ... and this turned out to be the last straw ... they charged my credit card for the rake anyway!Needless to say, I don't recommend this product and if you're reading this, don't even consider buying Littermaid. I wish Amazon had negative stars cuz this product would get a -10."
1,Not so Great Littermaid :(,"I thought the newest and fanciest Littermaid would be the bomb .. oh yeah it bombed all right. The litter area is WAY TOO small for a cat of 10 lbs or more and they end up peeing on the circuit board and shorting the unit out. I went through 3 of these (Littermaid replaced them for free)Littermaids in under 1 month. In the end, I went back to the other older version as the litter area on those is MUCH bigger."
1,Don't waste your money!,"This item was a complete waste of money! It worked about 3 weeks, after that nothing. The cats hated it. I went back to the old litter boxes because they would rather use the floor than this box. Absolutely disgusted with this product!"
1,Horrible litter box,This product does not work to completely clean the box. Do not waste your money. This box is cumbersome and and not made well. My cat did not like it and neither did I. Very hard to maintain. I am not inpressed at all. There are better products in the Litter Maid line.
1,A poor upgrade,"I had the older version for years and it worked quite well considering the cat usage. Then I made the horrible mistake of getting another one and boy is this model a dog! The metal tines are too far apart to rake much of anything into the tray. I tried several types of litter even the Littermaid litter and most of the time all I got was a pile of smelly poo and litter just before the tray and not in the tray. The cats still preferred the older model and used it more often. But alas, I moved and the older model was so worn after years of loyal service that both boxes were tossed in the move.I'm going to go back to the older version. Do not buy this one."
1,Litter Box,The new LME9000 Mega Advanced Automatic Self-Cleaning Litter Box is a piece of JUNK. I bought it when our regular old one gave out--we had it for over three years. The old one was great. This one does not clean the box and it will not stop running until I turn off the switch. Do not waster your money on it.
2,More or less functional,"It does what it's supposed to do -- barely.As others mention, the older models work a lot better. This one seems to be vastly underpowered -- it struggles with every pass, and if it encounters a clump it can't handle, or something stuck on the bottom, or even just a slightly-too-large pile of cat sand, it james and stops, then goes back and tries again. This can go on for a long time until you go over and fix it. It happens a lot. It's a bit messier than the old model, and putting the waste containers in is more of a pain.On the other hand, it does get most of the clumps/waste into the container when it doesn't jam. It's still less work than a manual litter box.But I won't buy another -- I'll stick with the older models."
1,New and improved.......,"..it is NOT. I ordered it in error thinking that I was buying the original LM 500. THat unit has its issues, but once you get used to the quirks, it works well. This ""improved version"" is anything but. First of all, it needs assembly and that's not easy. Secondly, the rake just doesn't work properly. It rides too high, missing a lot of debris, and the tines are too far apart. Our cats disdain to use it and have chosenn the rug instead. Ugh! The only positive thing is that the vendor has given me a full refund."
1,Terrible design! Awful Product!,"I wish I had heeded the warnings in other peoples' reviews of this device. Not only did it do a poor job, but, it was loud, (that is when it was actually working), it is cheaply constructed and very poorly engineered. I can't say anything good about it. Eventually, after about a year, it ceased to function entirely. Rather than go through the hassles of getting it fixed, I threw it out. The older style Littermaid boxes were far superior to this new one.You are throwing away your money, as I did, if you buy one of these."
1,Doesn't work,this worked for 3 days and then never worked again. when it did work the litter came out the bottom and had a hard time scooping up even the smallest of things.Don't buy this!!!
1,"Very cheap construction, won't last long","We've had our Elite for going on 8 months and it has progressively gotten worse, to the point where it will not even budge the tiniest of objects. It just makes a loud clacking sound. A plastic guide piece broke after about 3 months of usage. In short, this company is now making cheap plastic garbage, trying to bank on the reputation of the older one."
1,Dont buy it,"This one is the worst one, I wish had bought the older model I had that had served up well over the years."
2,"Read, and Heed the Warning!","This is one of the worst purchases I have ever made. It is dirtier than other litter boxes and requires more work.When I decided to buy one, I figured there were just a lot of naysayers on here. That is because I desperately wanted to believe that there was an easy way to deal with cat litter. Don't believe the lie, friend. You will pay 90% more for this than a cheap litter box, and do just as much if not more work. Listen, and do not make the mistakes of those who have gone on before you.Do not buy this!"
2,go with the basic unless you need the special features,I wish I had seen more of these reviews before buying the elite after my last one died. I have used these machines for almost 10 years... they lasted for a good 3-5 years each before they just stopped working. the older models were quite sturdy although haed to be careful with amount of litter and the newer tines are easier to clean. however this one is quite flimsy and have to take apart to pull the recepticle in and out. the recepticles really don't fit well especially the flimsy replacements. may be looking at alternatives soon as bit of a hassle to use...
1,Terrible,This litter box is an absolute nightmare compared to the prior Littermaid that I owned - believe the bad reviews.
1,Wish I had checked the reviews here first.,I thought this product would be an upgrade from my previou LitterMaid self-cleaning litterbox - it was not. I spend more time cleaning the mess this litterbox makes every day! This device is horrible and does not work well. Do not buy this product.
2,Newer does not mean better,"I have had two littermaid boxes that both lasted just over a year before they broke. I was so happy with their performance that I decided to upgrade to the newer and better version. I have had it for about 4 months and I have to say that I am very disapointed.The pans don't fit very well and a lot of litter ends up on the floor between the dump pans and the box itself. It waists a lot of litter! With the older boxes I would change the pan and add litter now I have to move the entire box, clean under and around about every 4 days. The ""air cleaner"" feature is a gimic and makes absolutely no difference!The only positive I can say is that the metal rakes are good for the larger clumps and it doesn't seem to get stuck as often as the older one. If I hadn't spent so much money on this tub of crap I would throw it away [...]."
1,Truly the worst litterbox I have ever owned....Do not buy this,"I've owned a total of 3 electric litterboxes over the past 6 years. The first 2 were also littermaids and worked fine. I upgraded the first one for a larger model and then the motor just finally wore out. At any rate, I purchased this new stupid ""Elite"" model in September of 2007 and it is horrible. The rake doesn't completely clear and most times it actually lifts up the plastic container and dumps the waste under the container instead of inside it. Every day I have to go down and check on it and every single day I have to touch it and reset it. I may as well own an old fashioned non-electric version for as much good as this thing does me. I realize it isn't ""Magic"" but I shouldn't have to reset and clean it myself every time. Avoid, avoid, avoid."
2,"Great concept, Poor Execution","Summary:Avoid the LitterMaid Elite Mega Advanced Automatic litter box unless its your only alternative to the traditional non-automatic box. I purchased the Elite Mega as a replacement for the LitterMaid LM900 which finally stopped working after many years of service. Unfortunately it was an impulse buy at a local pet store before I read the Amazon reviews. With a few tweaks in the design, the Elite Mega could be a pretty decent litter box. Primarily the LitterMaid company needs to deal with the weak motor which often doesn't have enough power to make it through a single cycle and the issue of Litter being thrown out of the box near the receptacle.Pros:Removable rakeOne piece bottomCons:Very weak motorComplicated assemblyToo much litter misses the receptacle and winds up on the floorThe receptacle doesn't open wide enough to accommodate some debris"
1,Dissapointed,Very difficult to assemble. Litter containers are very difficult to use because they are so flimsy. Raking action does not get the complete job done. Replacement containers are expensive. Would not recommend this.
1,"Cat crap, in more ways than one!","I spent about $185 on this and the receptacles are about $15 for 20.I can tell you with all honesty that this piece of junk created more of a mess and more of a hastle than just scooping the litter yourself.The motor was way too weak.The cat crap would stick in between the metal rake and dry like cement. No fun trying to rake the hardened crap out of the rake.The receptacle did not fit properly, so some of what did get raked in the direction of the receptacle ended up on the floor and not in the receptacle.After trying several different brands of litter and altering the amount of litter I placed in the machine, I finally gave up and threw this $185 hunk of junk in the dumpster where it belonged.I will never purchase another Littermaid product again!"
1,Horrible!,"First Automatic scooper, well it was supposed to be automatic... its manual because I end up scooping it everyday!And LOUD wow!So not happy with this product. For the price it is so disappointing."
3,Good alternative to the daily grind,"We use this with 2 brothers each about 15 pounds. We got the following tips when we got the box and it has worked well with it. Use a coating of baking soda before you add the litter to facilitate a clean sweep. Do not overfill the box with scoopable litter. Regarding complaints about litter on the floor, yes, it can dribble between the plastic receptor box and the litter pan. We recycle a used store plastic bag and set it under the leg at the junction."
1,NO PARTS!......says it all,"It works ok (it did for me) 'till it stopped....The roller on the end of the rake broke and since the MFG won't sell _ANY_ parts, we are screwed!Will not buy another product from Litter Maid.Learn from our mistake..."
1,Save your money!,"If I could have given this no stars, I certainly would have! I bought this to replace my original Littermaid [LM500] and that was a giant mistake. Everything other reviewers have mentioned is true - and you end up with a scoop-it-yourself litter box that cost a small fortune. Add in the money spent trying all the suggested litters - even their own which smelled awful - and your small fortune is now a sizable one. Eliminate the frustration and get the LM500 while it's still available [if IT even still works good] or just stick with scooping out a regular one. The best part of this contraption was when I threw it in the garbage."
1,Piece of junk,Don't waste your money. Every bad thing that you read about this product is true. I spend more time messing with this cat box than I ever did scooping the old cat box. It gets jammed easy. It's very loud. It's made cheaply. I wish I hadn't spent the money.
3,Littermaid,"I like that it cleans the box after each use...but it doesn't always get all of the ""debris"" in to the bin and leaves the box dirty. So then it's defeating the purpose of having a self cleaning box. It's still better than before, but I was expecting a lot from the little machine, especially for $100 plus."
1,DISSATISFIED WITH THIS PRODUCT,"I PURCHASED THIS TO REPLACE THE ONE THAT I HAVE BECAUSE THE AUTOMATIC CLEANING DOES NOT WORK.BUT THE NEW ONE HAS THE SAME DEFECT.I AM REALLY DISAPPOINTED IN LITTERMAID PRODUCTS.I HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO FIND ANY WAY TO GETSERVICE FOR THIS.I HAVE BEEN TRYING TO FIND THE CUSTOMER SERVICE FOR LITTERMAID FOR OVER A YEAR WITHOUT ANYLUCK.I ONLY GET PETCO AND THAT IS NOT WHO I WANT. THE BOX THAT I PURCHASED I HAVE HAD FOR OVER A YEAR, IT HAS NOT WORKED FROM DAY ONE.IT WAS PURCHASED ONLINE.I WOULD LIKE AN ANSWER.boblawn111@ptd.net"
2,don't waste your time,"I just bought this today. Got it home and put it together, which was a little confusing. It was loud, and it took awhile to get the right amt of litter so it would work right. Then after the cats used it twice it wouldn't stop running with no apparent reason. There was nothing blocking the rake and nothing behind it. I took it back apart and will be returning it, as if i'm having problems in the first few hours then nothing good is to come. Dont waste your time, it's not worth it."
1,"Save your money, don't buy this garbage","This product is worse than the material you need it to handle. It jams frequently no matter the amount of litter you use. It has broken twice, and I'm not spending more money to replace the rake. I was amazed they charged me the first time the tiny piece broke, which requires an entire rake replacement.Poor design and terrible customer service to sell a junky product marketed as elite with such flimy parts, then not replace it for free instead of forcing you to buy the whole rake assembly instead.Rake piece just broke again, but this time I will get a product that rates better from a different company."
1,Horrible Product,"I bought this product at Petsmart and it is absolutely horrible. Poor design. Poor application. Will break or have to be reset every other day. If they used sturdier materials (and actual metal railings, gears and wheels) it might be effective but this product, as well as most other automatic cat litter boxes are a waste of money. Ten dollars worth of materials with a 100+ pricetag and it does not work like they say it does. Do not buy."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"Like many other reviewers, we have purchased multiple littermaids in our cat's lifetime. We bought this one to replace our 3 year old littermaid who's motor eventually died after regular use by one cat. I was excited to get a new shiny ""elite"" littermaid, but was sadly disappointed when we found that they changed how the littermaid functioned. It no longer lifts the waste up and in to the recepticle - it now just slides everything in, which includes more clean litter than it does waste. It also isn't strong enough to scoop the ""pee spots"" which just get stuck in the corners of the box and forces you to have to scoop the box on a regular basis.So you throw out clean litter, and have to scoop the waste. At this point we will have to go back to a regular box, it is less work than this ""elite"" littermaid."
2,"Not worth it, buy 10 regular litter boxes","You would be better off to buy cheap litter boxes and replace them monthly than to spend your money on this. The disposable tray the poop is raked into is nearly impossible to line up right, so everytime the litter is raked over the edge, a good amount of it bypasses the tray and goes right onto the floor underneath. The construction is flimsy. The rake does a very poor job (I end up scooping through the box daily to get what the rake left behind). At this point, I've turned off the power and am using it as a very expensive, non automated cat pan."
1,So weak it can lift a cat turd,"As I write this review I'm watching the piece of junk go back and forth feebly attempting to lift a single turd. The motor is so weak and the design so poor it can slide a single cat turd up a 45 degree inclined plane. I'll have to scoop it. That says the whole story. It's so noisy that the cats are scared to death of it. For the noise it makes you'd think it could pull a stump.I spent $150 so I wouldn't have to do that. I'm so stupid that I bought to of these things. They are both incomparable pieces of what that are supposed to dispose of.Poor concept, Poor engineering, Horrible construction and no quality what so ever.Beware!"
1,Wasteful Awful Machine,"I had been using two Littermaid boxes for over 4 years, then last year one box died so I decided to get this new model. Amazon was great they had to send three, yes three, before I could get one that worked. It lasted exactly 16 months before the mechanism went crazy and started grinding gears at 4AM. In that period of time I was going through 40 pounds of litter a month for two cats because this device drags the waste through the litter and into the bin and by doing that takes a good deal of clean litter with the dirty. The older models lift the waste out of the ltter and drop it into the bin. If you gain any help from this review let it be this...do not waste your money on this model buy the older design, hey buy two and you'll still be ahaead."
1,BAD UNIT,Have had this unit for about 1 year and twice the rake roller has broken. Took LitterMaid 2 months to get the first replacment to me and now it has broken again. DO NOT recomened this unit!!! The ONLY unit they have made that last is the LM900/LM950. Had two of them and they both lasted 5+years!!
2,LM900 is Superior,"I bought this one thinking newer is better, right? I had three original littermaids before this and was quite happy with them. This one though, first of all, the ""air freshener"" doesn't help much, and all those little vents mean it's quite filthy and impossible to clean. Secondly, the metal rake doesn't work as well as the plastic rake and stuff gets caught in the back behind it. Finally, when you fill it to the recommended level of litter, it dumps half of it on the first pass into the receptacle. So you can never have enough litter in there to clump properly. I just bought another original LM900 (to replace the LME900 I own currently) because I can't stand it any more. The night timer I've never used, I keep hoping they will let you adjust the clump time, 10 minutes just isn't long enough even with their brand of litter.Having said all that, I have used it for two years and it's still easier than a litterbox, but for that kind of money, it should work better than it does."
1,A complete waste of my money,"This Automatic Self-cleaning litter box was a total waste of my money. the motor does not have the power it needs to scoop the waste into the bin at the end of the box. I only have one cat, so there is not alot of waste, but it still does not work the way it should. I paid alot of money for this litter box, and I am completely dissatisfied with this product. I will never recommend this product, and I would love to find a better product, without paying such an expensive price. A real disappointment!"
1,What a ripoff!,"We hoped that this automated litter box would help us keep the box clear to keep our new dog from eating from the box (I know, YUCK!!). Well, it does its electronic thing every ten minutes or so, but it takes more time to maintain than a regular litter box. If the point of this is to help people who can't bear to look at or touch cat pee or poop, forget about it. The receptacles are flimsy and easily collapse, and the tines of the rake get clogged up every single day (or more). It would have been much easier to save the more than $150 we paid for this and just take the time to clean our regular litter boxes. I am deeply disappointed. By the way, we use the highest quality litter - Arm and Hammer clumping multi-cat litter, which clumps just fine in the regular box, but gets all clogged up in the Littermaid. The concept of this contraption is brilliant, but it doesn't deliver what it promises. Too bad."
3,It is what it says it is...,"I actually owned this compilation on LP in the late 70's. As another reviewer has pointed out, the Beach Boys tracks ARE the Beach Boys. However, these are probably alternate cuts, demos, or experiments. Even when I owned this years ago on vinyl, I suspected that 'Surfin'--not sounding typically Beach Boys (but actually sounding quite Jan & Dean) may be something recorded when the groups were working together, as they often did. It was Jan Berry who really set Brian Wilson on the path to using high-quality studio musicians and experimenting with the sound, and they collaborated on a number of songwriting efforts. It is also fairly certain that they provided backing vocals for some of each other's recordings for a period of time. The rhythm vocal on 'Surfin' sounds like it very well may be Jan Berry. It is absolutely his style and vocal range."
5,great memories.,"very pleased with this CD. Just as described, just as expected. It old time music... not that I'm that old. But i love this music, great memories to have for a long time! I had alot of this old music, and my car was stollen and I lost all my music. Thanks to u guys, I can obtain my music back! This was a great buy!!!!! Just as offered. The delivery was A+ too. Keep it up!!!"
2,Major let down,"Did not eliminate most yellow tones. Had better results just using Shimmering Lights Shampoo under a showercap for 40 minutes and in ratio that is much more cost-effective (and compartively, more effective in general)."
1,Worst exam preparation book ever,"Despite its advertisement, the book does NOT prepare you for the IEAK exam. It is written very confusing and full of mistakes. The Beach Front Quizzer practice exam CD rom is the worst I have ever seen. None of the questions were covered in the real exam. I might have as well skipped studying this book and just gone into the real test without preparation. Needless to say, I failed this test the first time. I went back, bought the Dummies book, and now, after 4 weeks studying, passed the test on the second try.Meg CCNA,MCP"
3,Good baseline skills for the exam but will not make you pass,This book is a good read and has some great information but it will not help you pass the certification test. Knowing everything in the book and the quiz answers will get you to about 45% on the test and the rest is found either through experience or the Sun website.I did use this book for my studies as did a number of my co-workers. It is helpful but don't count on it ace the test.
4,good buy,"bought tuner for 13yr old, beginner learner;i love the price,esp because tuners locally run around $30 and they are very basic and generic; i also selected it for her because of the previous positive reviews it had; item was so easy to use, she did not refer to the instructions; loves the added benefit of learning chords and tones; she highly recommends"
4,Handy little device,I think this is a very user-friendly tuner with a lot of cool extras. I bought one for myself and one for a friend months later. We both love it!
3,Features are nice but it is difficult to get a tune,"I am using this device with a 6 string acoustic, steel guitar.Before this I had a vibration based tuner and I find that this device lacks in consistency on the tuning end. Sometimes it will pick up the right note every time. Other times I have to pluck the string 10-20 times before it will read. I try varying it too. Fleshy pick, fingernail pick, soft, hard, smooth, fast. It just seems too inconsistent.If I had it to do again I'd buy another vibration based tuner."
3,Good,This was good but not quite as good as PAPER ROSES. I would have liked a story about Kyle (from _Paper Roses_) too. I think that the subject of this story was just not that interesting to me but it was done well and the characters were likable. I don't know that I would pay to have this book searched.
4,This game sucks,"This game just plain sucks. Midway tried to rush it out, and they just destroyed it. The glitches are just endless. You can go right through walls. You can grind until time runs out. Gravity games are an odd name for this title because that's one of the forces of nature that isn't in great supply here. The controls are the weirdest things is the world. Save your money, and get matt Hoffman pro BMX."
3,A good bmx game,"Most people get down on this game because its to hard to do the tricks, or there's a few glitches. Well, if you are a real biker or former biker you will find this game pretty realistic. I think this game is better than Dave Mirra freestyle bmx 1 and 2. On Dave Mirra the dirt riding is way unrealistic and I wouldn,t buy it just because of that. On this game the dirt riding is great. You are able to ride in Fuzzy Halls back yard gravity games street, vert, and dirt course, as well as others. If you buy this game you won't like it at the start but as long as you stick with it, it will grow on you."
5,Casimir Pulaski,"This is an excellent book to read about the life of Casimir Pulaski who was a hero in the Revolutionary War. Pulaski was from Poland, yet came over to America to help fight against England. There is a monument and a fort named in his honor in Georgia. Best read by 4th graders and older. Middle School students would enjoy the book and read it easily. The cover of book offers a nice visual for early elementary students during a study of Pulaski's life."
3,"Good Headgear, snap breakage a problem","I have to agree that this headgear is very good. The foam is comfortable. It doesn't readily absorb sweat, and overall it doesn't feel ""hot."" But after less than one season of use the snap for the chin strap broke, and I have not been able to find a way to repair it."
3,Only Adequate St. Matthew,"I purchased this recording on the basis of the positive ratings posted by customers.Was I disappointed to discover it was recorded in 1970- not a bad thing in itself, butbottom-heavy and under-inflected instrumental playing combined with mediocre soloists (especially tenor Rotzsch) make for a recording I won't be returning to for a long time, if ever. I wish I'd purchased the Richter instead for an early seventies-style St. Matthew Passion!"
3,"OK, but not wholly reliable","I read this book some time ago, along with his book on German generals. It's interesting to compare the US history of the Lorraine campaign with the information in this, but I recently found a glaring error - he has the SS Panzer Corps attacking from south side of the salient in response to the Russian offensive of Feb 1943 that cut off (from rail links, anyway) two German army groups. Glantz (From the Don to the Dnepr)and other books with more details have the opposite-the corps (Das Reich and Totenkopf) attacked from the northwest side of the salient."
2,Little knowledge of events outside 38 Panzer Corps,This book presents a very limited view of a HQ officer of a German Panzer Corps. It is clear that he has a somewhat shored view of things happening outside of his Corps. He has very little knowledge of Russian behaviors and is clearly a one-sided biased presenter. In his work he is trying to discredit Red Army's victory and attribute it to other factors and intangibles.It is rather clear that he is not familiar with the evils perpetrated by NAZI occupiers while he would readily attribute things of that nature to Russians. Which could be expected from a front line commander unfamiliar with zonderkommandas
2,wedding songs,I don't think this CD is for weddings....I personaly didn't care for it. It's to circus like music...
5,Egyptian-Arabic This Book is a Must !!!!,"This book is outstanding! It gives you everything that you will need. One thing I would advise is to couple it with something audible because the Egyptian language is very particular in pronunciations. Most of their vowel sounds are quite a bit different from English. Just one slip of the tongue and you could be saying ""I want to go to the bathroom"" or ""I want to eat pigeon"""
3,"Watch it -- DON""T squeeze too hard",This is a very handy tool and cheap -- BUT don't squeeze too hard. I quickly sprung my pair crimping insulated terminals. The wire cutters now have gap over 1/16 wide and the stripper holes don't line up anymore.
2,"Second thoughts, a really good game (my bad!)","When I first got this game, I thought I made a mistake. The controls were extremely sluggish making it impossible to control objects and complete any of the timed puzzles. I met the minimum specs for playing the game, so why didn't it work? Answer: get a game-quality graphics card and like ATI or NVIDA and the game plays smoothly. Once I got past the technical frustrations, I settled into the game. I did not encounter any other bugs whats-so-ever. The storyline is fun and new, and humorous at times. The puzzles are clever and not too hard, although on a couple I had to get a clue on-line (I hate doing that!) so they are not all easy. This is a great adventure game for new and seasoned gamers alike. I racked up 24 hours of game play so I got my money's worth. I would definitely buy the sequel to this game."
2,Not Reliable,"This game loads properly on only one out of every three attempts. When it does load properly, the main character sometimes goes someplace completely different than where I click. If I don't do things in exactly the proper order, I can't get to the next clue. For example, at one point I had to go from a hotel desk to another building, talk to a guard, and come back to the hotel desk to find a clue. But when I came back, I did other things first and by then the clue was not there. Thanks to a walk-thru, I returned to talk to the guard about the same thing, and then came back and went directly to the clue. Not my idea of fun. I gave up."
1,Broken Sword ..Broken Game,I was excited to play this game.. and its terrible.. the movement is Slow .. tons of BUGS.. its like pulling teeth to play.. and its a shame.. cause this could have been a great game..THUMBS Down
4,Broken Sword Secrets of the Ark,If you like adventure games this will not disappoint. I happen to like this series a lot. The graphics are good and the story and acting are good. This is a solid adventure game.
4,Snoops on the loose,The Maggody snoops are on the loose again. I can just picture Mizzoner in the tree. I love this series.
1,really.....,This is a waste of money... I delete images that look better than most taken with a Lensbaby. These affects can easily be duplicated in Photoshop.
4,Definitely adds fun to your photos!,I'm a huge fan of tilt shift photography and this makes it so easy- good for newbies and pros alike. I bought it to use with my Olympus e-500 and it works great! Takes a little getting used to- but once you get a hang of it - it's a lot of fun to use! I've been comparing photos I've taken with it to ones I took with a regular SLR (same shots)- and the lensbaby certainly makes an ordinary photo more interesting. It's light and fits nicely in my camera bag. Comes with a little fabric bag to store it in. Instructions are easy- but just to note- in English only. If you really want to have more fun with your photo taking- This is a great way to do it. I wish it came with a sun filter to protect the lens. Not sure if they make one for it or not.
3,Needs practice!,It's only been a short while since I bought the lens baby so I've not really mastered the technique yet. I have been surprised by how much you need to practice (but maybe that's just me). Getting your subject in focus is tricky and getting the 'sweet spot' when you bend the lens is even more difficult. But I'm pleased with the couple of decent pictures I've managed to snap. It'll just take time and there are some decent web-sites out there to help out with tips and techniques.
5,New Mom says a must have!,"This is the most beautifully composed music I've heardto this date, I also have a newborn son which adds to myopinion. I would recommend this to any parent-to-be, parent,or grandparent. It was wonderful to listen to during my pregnancy and especially during labor."
3,"Sorry, we weren't impressed",This cd was ok but not as unique as it seemed. Perhaps an older child would like but my baby didn't.
5,"Beautiful, real music. Our favorite","This is real music, not horrible kiddy-stuff, that I leave on long after baby has fallen asleep. The music is simple enough that it won't over-stimulate a baby you're trying to calm, but interesting enough to captivate a parent."
5,The best lullaby CD ever!,"This is the best CD! We have literally played it every night since we brought our son home from the hospital. He is almost two, and now the first few bars of the first song makes his lids heavy. We like it because it has a mellow jazz sound that isn't nauseating to a parent. We now have two copies because our newborn is sharing our bedroom, and our older son ""needs"" his CD to go to bed, too. I would highly recommend this to all adults who are looking for a perfect marriage between music that appeals to both baby and parent!"
1,"Simply Unprofessional, Yuck!!!!","First of all, I was shocked to find out this artist Dave Koz, and his cds and has started to realize there is such a terrible release is being sold at the music market. Fortuantely, the package is highly polished by Dave's producer therefore gained much airplay and popularity. I agree with other amazon buyer's comment that he had to stop playing this cd and shut down the stereo for good - I would simply make my life a little simpler and happier, put in a Kenny G cd instead. Kenny G is the man who can ""play"" anything with emotional. Let compare with those song on Dave's cd and Kenny G's great song ""Joy of Life"", then you will see the way Kenny G use his saxophone magic to reach everyone's heart with such a hamarious, joy feeling. Only the child would be listen to and fool by this kind of music."
5,Must buy this for baby and you!,"I purchased this CD when my son was born three years ago and we listened to it everyday for at least the first year of his life. I would play it during naptime and it is by far my favorite baby CD. It's soothing and sentimental. After searching my entire house for weeks trying to find our copy when baby #2 was born, I ordered another from Amazon since my search left me empty handed. My little girl is so relaxed listening to this compilation and since I already mentioned how sentimental this disc is to me, it brings me so much joy to listen to it with her. Even brings tears to my eyes. Who doesn't love holding a baby girl listening to John Stoddart sing ""Isn't she lovely?"" This album will not disappoint! Buy one for yourself and another copy for your best girlfriend!"
1,Straight Facts,I have not read the book but I would be more open-minded toward it if first off you had the author's name right whom you are rebuking. It's JOSH not John.
1,It's just insulting!,"I am rating this book a 0. The book is a complete waste of ink (and film - the photos appears to have been taken by an elementary school graduate of photography). It's written by a couple of unsophisticated authors who really don't know how to throw a party, but pretend they do. Every sentence is an insult and the tone of the book is haughty, obnoxious, and goofy. How many times do I need to reminded to throw out the thrash after the party? Or better yet, on some pages, before the party??? Next time I decide to waste money on a book, it will on a Martha Stewart publication sans insults and corny jokes.I would give this book to an enemy just to torture them."
1,Poor Customer Service From This Store,"I purchased the pants and shirt from this store and they sent completely wrong sizes on both. I have emailed them to request to exchange them for the correct sizes, with no response from the store. I ordered an XL shirt and received size 2X. I ordered XLlong pants and received 3X pants. So I am just out the money I have spent and received unusable mechandise. The product itself would have been fine if they had sent the correct sizes. I would never order from them again."
2,motion light,the lights are to sensitivity the wind makes them come on have turned sens all the way down and they still come on
2,Not made well,This item is not made very well...it needs more metal parts...breaks real easy and angle adjustment are bad also as they will notStay in place.....
2,ok,It wokrs but it is very very very cheap china stuff. Very dissapointed but should have know by the price.
3,Nice flood light for the money ...,I am a bit concerned about the plastic construction sine this will be mounted outside in the elements seems a bit light weight ...
2,"Wasn't able to use, not compatible with my electrical box","Perhaps this is stated in the product description, but this product wouldn't work at all with the electrical box I have on the outside of my home. My box requires a metal bracket that goes across diagonally where there is a screw hole in the middle, this product requires a box where there are 4 screws at each point of the square.The product is also all plastic, very cheap, but that's not really a knock since it's also very cheaply priced."
1,Garage door opener,This would be a good item except that I can not use it. It is incompatible with my garage door opener.
3,Will Fireblade Burn Out Its Competition or Will It Fizz Out?,The box of fireblade seems very catchy to the eye but we all know it's what's on the inside that counts. This is a Midway game and Midway has had it's ups and downs like for example Mortal Combat was a kick [butt] game but then again Kurt Warner left people with a pure bad taste in their gaming desires so only a good play of this game will tell if it is worth the wait or should we just save our money for the coming of stuntman in 8 days after so hopefully Midway will have finally found another up in their gaming production. Good Luck!
3,Comprehensive coverage but not an easy read,"A dry read. Great concepts. But you almost need supplementary material with more depth if you want to get a handle around all that it tries to cover. I picked it up because I thought it would be a good and easy refresher. Good it was, easy it was not. More practical examples would have helped. The best chapter was the last chapter when you finally see some real world application of the concepts described in the book."
4,"Good, but you won't mistake this for a candy bar!","This was a pretty tasty snack as far as nutritional bars go, but if you are expecting this to taste like a Snickers bar like they hint, you will be disappointed. That being said, it is better than many bars on the market plus it is not overly sweet."
1,Unappetizing product,"The carmel bars chocolate coating had numerous white spots and crumbled. Although I sure the product is still usable, it is less appetizing."
2,The bars taste stale!!!,"I initially tried the Balance Bar S'mores at Trader Joe's and couldn't believe how good they tasted. Unfortunately, I can't seem to find these bars in any store, so I tried Amazon. When I got the bars I couldn't wait to try them. Instead of tasting moist, the bar tasted stale. Something seemed wrong. The graham cracker part was hard and I could barely taste any marshmallows. In fact, I don't think there were any marshmallows in the bar. I checked the expiration date on the box and it said the bars don't expire until 2012, but they tasted stale and the chocolate was pealing off.I hope I can find these bars somewhere else with better luck because they used to be moist,crispy and delicious with a bit of fluffy cake in the graham cracker part."
3,caramel nut blast,how sad that this product has been changed. i use these bars as part of my weight control after losing weight last yr. i have been using them since last feb. it is easy to taste the difference. they now have a waxy taste to them. to bad.
3,Balance Gold Bars,"Normally, we enjoy these bars--they taste just like a snickers bar but healthier. Our only problem was the condition of the bars in which Nutricity sent them. They were stuck to the wrappers and appeared to have been melted or something. Will purchase them again as we have in the past but not from Nutricity."
2,Its great... when its not broken,"This is a great product when it works. But, there doesn't seem to be any quality control. I am on my 5th or 6th steamer now. I have had to return 3 or 4 of these. They only have a one year warranty and don't expect it to last more than that. The thing is, when it works its great which is why I keep buying one. I have to admit I am kind of adicted to it. It works really well on cleaning carpet and fabric. I especially like to use it to clean the car and the kitchen. Maybe eventually they will make one that doesn't break all the time. I have also purchased the Shark equivalent and had the same issues with it."
1,Don't Buy,I tried it in the bathroom and on tennis shoes without luck. The only thing it has worked on is the grout on my tile floor. I'm considering returning the steamer.
1,Rip Off - Criminal to be ablre to sell this item,"This item is so falsely represented on the infomercial and it's advertising nationwide and on its box.This product will steam away that dirt or material which you can easily hand wipe away - for anything more significant such as some baked on grease on the stove top, I steamed and steamed - then finally in exasperation just took my normal cleaner, orange clean paste cleaner and the same sponge with the scouring pad on the bottom and it all wiped clean easily. The steaming did nothing but aggravate my wrist as it is very heavy.This company should be ordered to return the money to everyone who purchased it. I will be sending it back as soon as the post office opens after Christmas!"
5,Perfect for nooks and crannies,"I love this steamer! Buy it just for the nooks and crannies around the house that you'd have to normally spray with a cleaner, then scrape it with a pointed object. This cleans floor corners where detergent builds up, toothbrush holders, the layer of grease that builds up on cabinet molding in the kitchen, etc. You have to wait afew minutes after plugging it in before the steam builds up. Pressing the button a few times also helps. (like a steam iron) If the steam doesn't seem to be coming out as well, wait a few minutes for it to build up again."
3,Geeks and Steamers,This is a little off topic but as a person checking out all the steamers I find it mind blowing that even gamers on their message boards are discussing the usefulness of these machines. My teenager showed me this yesterday on The World of Avlis...whatever Avlis is: avlis.org/viewtopic.php?t=35784
5,"I have read millons of books on Marilyn, this one is very good.","This is a very good read. Colin Clark worked with Marilyn and Sir Laurence Olivier. He is brutally honest about his observations as the movie was being filmed. This English shoot just wasn't Marilyns ""Cup of Tea"" since it seems no one really liked her. Marilyn gave the crew gifts after the end of the shoot and everyone dumped them in the trash.Colin Clark is very witty and honest, even disclosing he had gay sex with someone who worked on this movie (and he was straight), you can't get more honest than that."
5,"Nose bleeds, just Major, Major Nose Bleeds!","Queens Blade is.......a constant nose bleed waiting to happen. This show has action, blood, violence and last but not least, T&A it delivers on so many levels and I hope to see more. now if you don't mind my nose is going too start bleeding again."
4,Great Game! Good music!,"""Wipeout 2097"" is the sequel to ""Wipeout"" and delivers more futuristic racing, which the original game was all about. ""Wipeout 2097"" is set in the year 2097, and the game boast many improvements over the previous game. The graphics are better, the sound is better(although the music isn`t quite as good as the original), the gameplay is greatly improved so that it`ll be enjoyed more by newcomers and experts alike. The game is excellent, but it really isn`t that different from the previous game, so if you didn`t like ""Wipeout"", you won`t like ""Wipeout 2097"". Recommended!Lots of fun!"
5,Everyone borrows it!,"I love this story so much that when I read it , my preschoolers want me to read it over again.My co-workers also love it so much that it seems to be missing every fall when I want it.So, I ordered another one, and will hide it this time."
4,Turkey's Perspective,This book has been around for quite sometime but it makes for great rhythm while performing reader's theaters based on the book. The students love the story. It's also a powerful book for teaching perspective!
4,April fools proposal,I decided to propose to my girlfriend on April Fools. What better way to do it than while wearing a Jester's costume. Price was right and so was her answer! I'll probably wear it again sometime in my lifetime.
4,Riveting theater treat,"Contrary to the review published above, I saw this film at its premiere showing at the Film Forum in New York, and found it fascinating and exciting. The film was a riveting documentation of the organic artistic process in the theater. The film is far from a commercial for Sam Shepard - on the contrary, it demonstrates in part, the difficulty he had managing his volatile but brilliant cast for the production of his strange, fascinating play, The Late Henry Moss. Good for anyone in the theater or any of the arts."
5,Great product and seller...,"Speedy delivery, love this lamp it has worked for me and is still running strong. The seller had a speedy delivery and great communication. Thanks again!"
2,He's good historian,"tom clancy is an excellent historian and technical writer, but bad a fiction. His book on the special forces was so in depth, it was almost to much information. This book was a waste of his time. he should have used his time better by writing a history book then this. He just did it for the money like all his fiction. If your a military nut who has fantasies of being a secret agent of being in special ops, then Tom clancy is for you. If you're a reader who wants a book that is believable and has well developed characters then stay away. But that really only is my compliant, the story and the character. The movies are awesome but the books [are bad] (never thought I'd say that). Read michael crichton."
3,Pick up one of his earlier works,"This was an ok novel, but it can in no way compare to 'The Hunt for Red October' or 'Red Storm Rising.'The main problem with this book is its tedious length. It starts out okay, but then you're treated to 200 pages of hospital recovery. <yawn>If this book was shorter, it would be another 5-star Clancy techno-thriller, but for the lack of action and generally boring writing, it merits 3-stars."
1,Wretched Excess,"I enjoyed Hunt For Red October and Red Storm Rising for what they were -- pulp fiction with lots of action and enough juicy details about hardware and weaponry to satisfy a modern techno-fetish. Great literature they're not, but they're entertaining. But THIS...Clancy obviously read super-hero comic books when he was a kid. His Jack Ryan is unbelievably heroic. Scant pages into the book he's knighted by the Queen, and not long after that he's giving the Prince a pep talk and handing him back his manhood. (No, I'm not kidding.) Golly, that Jack knows everything and can do anything! Let's make him President!If you are a ten-year-old (or just think like one) you might like this book. If you're looking for something that doesn't insult your intelligence, look elsewhere."
4,Another winner for Tom Clancy,Clancy shines again in this exciting tale of terrorism and international intrigue. Jack Ryan foils an assasination on the Royal Family while on vacation in London. This draws the ire of the IRA and ignites a chain of violence on several continents. This may be Clancy's second or third best novel. Definitely worth the read.
1,Bad transmitter design,"I have had this product over a year. I bought this in Dec 2007 from Amazon. I have had to have the transmitter replaced three times. There is a latent defect in how the transmitter is designed that causes it to stop working. After the warranty ran out I opened up my once-again not functioning transmitter and found that the battery connector had a broken solder joint on it. What happens is that the screw cap for the battery makes contact with a ring that has a stub on it. That stub then gets soldered right to the transmitter board. Because of this whenever I would need to change out the batteries I would twist the battery cap, that would flex the ring with the stub, that flex would break the solder joint to the board and the transmitter would not work any more.The collars themselves are great. I have not had any problems with them."
1,Miniature ...,"Appropriate ages 5 - 12? No way. I would not allow my niece who just turned 7 to play with these scantily clad dolls. ... McDonald's is featuring the Bratz in their Happy Meals in May 2003. On the Happy Meal box, there is a picture of the dolls with their stomaches exposed and one doll has on a skirt that barely covers her assets. ..."
5,Simple Simple Simple,"This book should not to be used to find out the wheres and whys of magick, this book is a darn good finding out the who we are in the path! It touches some basic concepts of how we use our tools and groups and what the things are that mean something to us witches. My most treasured part of reading this book was that I felt so much respect for my path when I was finished reading it. Ohhh I have read the damnation and all the pain and suffering that those on this path had to carry, but this book made me feel part of a bigger something and with it's very light touch in the history of how we (the pagans) became where we are! Many Blessings and may you find the path for you that will help you touch your soul with love and reverance."
1,Not an Informative Guide,I was not impressed at all by this book. I found the information to be extremely basic and surfacey. It had no depth. The writing style was horrible. There are many other and much better books on paganism than this one. Stay away.
3,An Overlooked Intro,"It's nothing extraordinary, but I think it's a good little book for anyone who is just stepping into a Pagan religion. The author seems extremely tolerant, and is aware of the book's shortcomings because it is ONLY AN OVERVIEW. He encourages the reader to ask questions and to do extensive reading. It is not a how-to book; he simply uses his own tradition as a guide, then encourages the reader to research other paths to find a fit for them. Like I said, nothing Earth-shattering, but worth the hour and a half it takes to read it if you're a beginner."
3,Mixed review,We like the appearance of the fixture. There is some difficulty adjusting the range of the motion-detection feature. There is not enough headroom to use a CFL bulb.
4,Jack,Good condition. Slightly blurry but still good.Specifications listed and the actual size specifications also match.Arrived in Good condition.Love this poster.
3,sissy bar bag,"You get what you pay for.....the bag has been on the bike for about six months and is starting to come apart. Will remove this winter to repair and glue back together again. If you can spend more, get something better. This bag is good if used for temporary purposes until a better bag becomes affordable. The straps that come with it are basically useless, had to rig up my own system and bolt the bag to the sissy bar."
1,I think this movie really misses the point.,"I've been a long time fan of Charles Bukowski's work and i was sadly disappointed with Factotum. I think Matt Dillon is a great actor but this movie just doesn't work. To me, this movie came off as if it were the 'Coles Notes' of Bukowski's work and unfortunately flows like a high school book report. I think Matt Dillon was way to polished for the part of Bukowski and because of it Hank came off almost completely devoid of passion and wit. Matt's performance regrettably does not touch his incredible work done in ""Drugstore Cowboy"" or any other one of his many great roles. I think some great talents were cast and i don't want to take anything away from them but this movie simply doesn't work. If you're a Bukowski fan and you haven't already seen 'Barfly', i would defiantly recommend it over this."
5,Great,Great movie with hilarious dialogue. An alocholic writer who doesn't give a flip and marches to his own beat. Funny stuff!
5,Great product,"Easy to use, good quality, simple to clean. Would buy again if replacement was ever needed."
1,I want to smash it,"Absent cup markings make this most aggravating to use especially since cup sizes are not true cups and the filter mechanism consumes an unaccounted for additional volume. I emailed the company, but they didn't seem to think my complaint warranted a response. Went out and got a Cuisinard 4 cup. Thanks, but no thanks."
2,Disappointed,"I am very disappointed in the shipping. I recieved my coffe press and the glass was broken. I don't know how it will taste. I was sooo looking forward to it only to be heart broken. I am sending it back and trying once more to get it all in one piece. So we shall see...Will give another opinion when I get the other one. Kathy from Charleston, S.C."
3,"Good cup of coffee, but full of sediment and silt...","My husband and I have been using this for a few months now. In general the coffee brewed by it is quite good. Unfortunately the ""double screen"" effect doesn't do much to filter out the sediment. I'm now wowed by it, but it's small, portable and makes a good cup of coffee."
1,Save your money!,"Like evrything else in this world it keeps getting smaller! this press says it makes 8 cups, maybe if you are using espresso cups you could squeeze out 8! I use 12oz coffe cups and it fills it 2 1/2 times and dont think of using it for company unless you pour yours first! and the ""flavor lock"" feature is just another fun item to start your day out aggervated as you try and clean the grinds out from in between the filter and fins and if you decide you want a 3rd cup later in the morning guess what? you get to start the B.S. all over again! if you are going to label something for retail it should have to follow the standard measuring system instead of the standard of deceit! if you buy this product after reading this reveiw, ENJOY!"
4,Good but too big!!,"The hair brush was good, but it was bigger than I expected. It is for people with really long hair, my hair is pass my shoulders and this brush was too big. I got later the CL-65 and it was the perfect size for me"
2,"Ok, but very minimal","This was a short, minimal vid. Gave us some ideas but you probably can get this information from the internet for free with very little effort."
5,Protection and Fidelity for your vinyl,"Angled, gentle and moisturized brush effectively digs into vinyl grooves, and coats the cleaned vinyl surface for a better protection and fidelity. I feel quite a difference, especially when sliding vinyl in/out of a plastic inner sleeve. I wrap the entire brush with a Saran sheet after each clean-up session, so that I found fluid stays inside brush for a quite some time for use in so many later clean-up sessions."
3,A mixed bag,"The brush does an excellent job, and the storage base is a handier addition than it might seem at first. The solution bottle is tiny, however, and the spout spills solution all over the place. 5 stars for the brush, 0 stars for the poorly designed and tiny bottle of solution."
5,"I don't think anything will ever match the old wooden with red gripping material, but this is as good as it will get for now.","I don't think anything will ever match the old wooden with red gripping material, but this is as good as it will get for now. You need something to wipe your records clean from dust, and this product is superior to the knockoff that looks like the old wooden bar with the red gripping material."
2,Dries out almost immediately,"The record care brush is good, but, alas, the design dries out almost immediately. Without some moisture from the supplied solution (it's a mix of alcohol, organic solvent, a surfactant and water), static defeats the intended use of the brush."
5,house for mouse,This book is so cute and the illustrations are wonderful. Great for reading to toddler aged. Simple rhymes makes it easy for child learning to read.
3,Little technical detail,I was hoping for more specific detail about the individual parameters measured in an echocardiogram. Few are mentioned and even less about the range of values.
2,it's a rather childish book,"came looking for a good fantasy novel. i might have liked it in my early teens, but now (early 30s) I find the writing predictable, childish, and thus boring. stopped reading it."
2,Great for those who like it...,"I read this as a teenager and liked the dark themes, the deep pessimism and preoccupation with death, the more horrible the better. Now I read it and don't like it any more.If you enjoy Holocaust poetry or Darfur poetry or poetry about senseless, tragic death and loss you will like this. I am acquainted with a major contemporary poet who considers Housman to be brilliant in every sense of the word.In terms of poets who can be a bit ""dark"", I like Poe, Pound and TS Eliot, but I just can't see that brilliance in Housman.Not to say that Housman was not a brilliant intellectual; he is considered one of the the leading scholars of his time as Professor of Latin at Cambridge. That does not help me though, as the poetry often seems ""pedantic"" in the sense of being ostentatious in one's learning.This book has been in print continuously since 1896 so some people like it all of the time. Maybe you are one of them."
3,The poems of A E Housman have resonated with me since my youth.,"The volunteers who put this book together are to be congradulated for their effort to keep this literature available. However, it would only take a small effort to improve the appearance of the text with tools such as Scrivener. I'd volunteer to do it if I had the text files."
3,I left it on the shelf.,"I flipped through this book in a bookstore and considered buying it, but I was turned off by the fact that in the text the co-authors are consistently referred to as ""June,"" ""Barbara,"" and ""Dr. Rubin."" The book is in a question/answer format, so the image of two women kowtowing to a male expert is perpetuated page after page. I knew this would drive me crazy as I was reading it, so I left it on the shelf.Unfortunately, this review form won't allow me not to give a numerical rating. Not having read the book, I can't give one that's meaningful -- so I've just given it an ""average"" rating."
5,fantastic !!! I couldn't put the book down.,I got this book for my mom who is an avid reader.She finished the book in three days . The book kept her attention and the writer is one of her new favorites
1,Shoplet Won't Send This,"When you order this lamp from Shoplet, they will send you a four pack of lightbulbs instead. Apparently they have the item numbers mixed up in their database."
4,PARKS,"First of all let me state catagorically that this book is hella overpriced..it's a VERY thorough book on the parks the author decided to cover..quite an eclectic selection. Where was the Bois de Bologne, Hyde Park, Fairmont Park, Hermann Park, Golden Gate Park...???..For this amount of money, I would expect every major urban park in the world to be included..certainly more of the great American Parks...and frankly Hyde Park and the Bois are arguably the most famous in the world, the great Central Park, Prospect Park, and the Teirgarten are included thankfully, but this is hardly comprehensive, the parks he does cover, he goes very indepth and the images are adequate..but get real, the price of this book is in a word: outrageous"
3,Yucks!,"Yucks! I bought this doll for my cousin and the next day, she complained that her arms broke and the doll's clothing were lost especially her skirt. In the end, I bought for her a My Scene Barbie Wave 2( Barbie is her favorite in the My Scene gang) and she loved it to pieces and me, I too have My Scene dolls and sets and I am almost completing the My Scene set with a FEW more to go. So as you see, My Scene overpowers Bratz! Now, my cousin has three My Scene dolls already but she hasn't got Madison coz she's waiting for the Wave 3 Madison doll."
4,Great book to learn to make your own beauty products,"Blended Beauty is a fantastic book for those who want to experiment making their own beauty products. I am a huge fan of the Philip B hair care line, and I wanted to find a cheaper alternative to some of his products, without sacrificing quality. I tried the honey maple hot oil treatment, and it was fantastic! It rivals the Philip B oil that you buy in salons. The only difficult part is that you have to find some of the ingredients, however there's some great web sites that can supply you with all the necessary goods."
1,Never Judge a book by it's cover,"I have a Casio Exilim S-10, and I bought this case for it to keep it from damage, in particular, scratches. Well I found out that this nice looking genuine leather case actually scratched the metal rim around the lens. I have put the case back in it's packaging, and I feel as though I have wasted $21. The button on this case isn't protected well enough on the inside, which as a result, has scratched my camera. I would NOT recommend this product to anyone"
1,"well i got them to fill an order, and",there sitting on the floor on the steps taking up space. nnnnnnk ghgfjhkgf oihih igi po jojoiuj oljikh iug okj l; ;i oj pk ;l;k h;oi j lk ;l j po ;k ;lk ;lmn;lk
3,"I agree with others--cheaply made, but works","I guess you get what you pay for. The mounting holes didn't line up with the fixture this was replacing, so I had to drill new holes (could have bought an adapter plate, but I didn't). The four screw holes must be drilled out to install. The screws and wiring nuts that came with the light were worthless--screws are too short and nuts are far too small to fit on 12-gauge wire.Works fine once I installed it. Sensor is sensitive enough for my application (about 10 ft up on the side of my garage) and able to cover directly below the light out to the edge of the cement pad (about 15ft) and to both sides. Used with CFL flood lights, and it works fine."
5,Bicycle Saddle Pannier,"Wow what a gift. It is easy to put on, easy to take off, lots of room, light weight and holds a lot of stuff."
3,"Lots of room, very durable, but...","You have to make sure you get this bag with a rack that will keep it out of the rear spokes. The ""Sunlite Bicycle Welded Spring Rear Rack"" does a good job with this, but the ""Sunlite Alloy Rear Carrier for Bicycles (26"")"" does NOT. The latter rack allowed the bags to swing into the spokes. Pretty scary. The bags also need to be mounted very high, otherwise your heels will clip the bags frequently. I could not find a rack that would make these bags work with my Cannondale Caad 9."
4,Tough Bag,"The saddle bag is excellent quality. The pockets are 4 inches deep, 13 inches wide and 3 wide at the top and 9 inches wide at the bottom due to some angling so your heel won't catch on the bag. The straps that hold the bag to the rack tend to loosen a bit after a few rides, but are easy to tighten. I'm considering replacing them with velcro straps so I can remove and replace the bag more easily."
1,Just Terrible,"So many of the Christian leaders in the book are attacked. But that's probably mind control, they don't know, the aliens are controlling their thoughts! What? This is another sad attempt to discredit the great Christian leaders who are working hard to solve problems in the world. If Cathy isn't solving them by writing her ramblings then I guess we should all just give up."
3,entertaining but for beginners,"There are a few entertaining stories and a couple of useful strategy tips, but for the most part, this isn't a book you need to own. It's worth reading, and decent primer, but it's really Phil Gordon trying to make a buck.It gets 3 stars mostly for the section that teaches short-hand for changing outs to odds."
4,Top 3 poker book,"Of all the poker authorities out there, I'll put Phil Gordon in the top three, along with Brunson & Sklansky. Without being arrogant or aloof, he explains the history and techniques of the game. He explains the odds and math in very simple terms that anyone can understand and benifit from. Phil walks you through the stages of learning the game. You learn how to play on line and setting up your own home game. He then walks you through moving from low to middle limit games. ""The Real Deal"" will definitely step your game up a few levels. This is a great addition to anyone's poker library."
5,Very interesting read,"I purchased this book in preparation for my first trip to the Philippines. I found the book very resourceful and full of interesting tid-bits. I'm leaving this month, so I will not know how practical the book is until then. However, everyone has picked it up off my coffee table and enjoys looking through it. Compared to other travel books that I have looked at, this one has been the most informative and organized."
4,INevitable is tight,"I heard INevitable and once again realized how tight of a flow Hen & Melo have. I have been listening to them since ""The Arrival"" and their style is phenomenal. I'm sad to see Melo has dropped out of the game, but Hen has a few solo albums that are really good."
1,"Only 5 flavors, Not 10 as advertised","Really liked the 10 flavor sour mix from Jelly Belly, but couldn't seem to find them locally anymore. Now they are selling the sour mix as a 5 flavor mix. Was concerned following the other review about beans sticking together, but decided it'd be worth it to have 10 flavors. Box arrived and they were stuck together, but only 5 flavors. A waste of my time. Never would have ordered if product had been described correctly by the seller. Just drive to the store and get the 5 flavor mix that's not already stuck together."
1,Only 5 flavors... not 10.,"While I love the 5 flavor mix, I miss the old 10 flavor mix I used to be able to get, and when I found this I thought my problem was solved since the 10 flavor mix isn't in stores around here. However when I got the package there were only 5 flavors... Dissappointed."
5,The friendly ghost,"This is a nice, short and easy story to read, it will show you the way people think about themselves and about others, you can read this fairy tale while waiting in the airport, it won't take you more that an our to read it, OK, maybe two hours and you will have a smile after you finish the book."
3,Just what I expected!,"I expected a lightweight little pan, and that's exactly what this is. The non-stick surface needs help to keep eggs from sticking, and the pan doesn't balance on a gas burner very well without water in it; also, the pan's handle and the egg holder ""tab"" both get very hot, so you have to come up with a technique to manage a bulky potholder/small hot parts combination. That said, I use mine nearly every day and am perfectly happy with it!"
1,Poor quality sealing envelope,I cannot recommend this product as the alleged Grip-Seal does not work. You will need to use tape to seal this envelope if you don't want the envelope to open up in transit.
4,Good General information,"We bought this book, because we are looking for the perfect breed to join our household. So whenever we fancy a certain breed we like to get a book about it. This inexpensive little book gives an exellent first time greyhoundowner guidebook. Not only does it give you tips how to housetrain an ex-racer, but gives good and sound advise for training, feeding and dogcare in general. It gives examples, little stories and facts to make the read more intersting. Did you know that Bo Derek owned Greyhounds? Daniel Braun Stern' book made us read (and buy) several books about sighthounds and the adoption of retired racehounds.You will need more indepth information later on, but if you get this book to make up your mind - in that case it is a very good book to buy!"
2,roller on bottom broke,"The table itself was very sturdy and I was happy with it until one of the rollers broke after two weeks use. A piece of plastic broke off the roller and it is not usable. I can still use the table but have to pick it up to move it. I am using it with a hospital bed, so it is not very handy now."
5,"A lot more than overbed, I have 3 now","I use this table for photography, a place to put parts and pieces, guests use it for a writing table, and my wife uses it for a laptop. We have used it only once for sick in bed with the flu. The three best features are sturdy (not flimsy), adjustable height, and mobility. Sometimes it is used all the way down at table height, as a writing table. Sometimes all the way up for stand up work. A few times in the middle. Easily moves in and out as needed. The cup holder places are not necessary for me, but the lip around the edge keeps things (laptop) from sliding off and presumably contains liquid spills. We use them so much, we now have three in the house -- one bedroom and two roll around for work. For the superior strength and stability alone, it is worth the price compared to cheaper ones."
2,Hard to stay with...,"I like Susan Anderson and I love her cover art - they make her books so attractive! So full points for marketing - the cover, the synopsis, they work well.However the story was really, well, un-romantic for starters. I didn't warm to either Nick or Daisy, didn't really care what happened to them and didn't fall in love with anyone in the book. Actually, I was really disappointed with the book, it seemed to be unacceptably formulaic, and Anderson has written far better books.I just hope the next one is back up to her usual standard."
3,"Funny, not the funniest, but funny","I found Susan after raiding a used bookfair. I really enjoyed her first book, Baby I'm yours, but the following novels did not do much for me. They were funny, but it was not that same feeling that I received from that first book. I enjoyed the characters, and the plot, it just wasn't my favorite."
4,Very Funny!!!!!!!!!,"At first, I was little disappointed that Jamie Foxx didn't make any appearance at all. But, I enjoy all the comedians featured. I watch it quite often."
1,No Pictures,"I downloaded this book for my Kindle with the idea that I could read it with my preschool grandchildren. I am disappointed that there are NO PICTURES included. I will be deleting it from my Kindle, as it is useless without them."
2,Deer can go through with little effort,"We installed five rolls of this deer barrier fencing. The deer have gone through the fencing several times. It rips quite easy. We cut a piece and patch it over the rip with zip ties. It doesn't look pretty. I wish we had gone with a stronger deer fence. We will probably have to take all this down and replace it with something better. Also when installing, one half is straight and the other half is on an angle. The squares are not lined up straight. Makes it harder to install. Maybe it was a defect in the rolls we received. So if you have deer that want to come through they will with no problem. We watched one the other night come running, jump through one side and straight through the other side as if it wasn't there. If they want to come through they will."
3,Group,Definitely better when used in a group setting. If you get it for yourself I doubt you will be challenged enough to benefit from it.
2,All Downhill with the Love Story,"I can live with the technical inaccuracies or the typo errors. I even like the high-level look at Patton's campaigns and battles which is the only reason I gave this 2 stars. But the love story was way too much! Go back to ""Aces"" Bill."
4,Great fun,"Hilarious story and dialogue, good acting, good martial arts. The Shannon Gee review says Michelle Yeoh doesn't ""really"" use the Wing Chun style, but that's not entirely true. She does use quite a few moves outside the system, and there's no excuse for having a supposed WC practitioner fly up into the air, but at least half her moves are pure Wing Chun. This is obviously not the best example of WC on film, but there is enough to make a WC student say, ""Oh yeah, I know that move!""My previous comment notwithstanding, the high-flying, impossible stunts are mostly kept to a minimum - although there are a few groaners, such as a tofu cake flying around Yeoh in a full circle, with a cartoonish slide-whistle sound effect. And of course, the inevitable 20-foot high jump.I also disagree with another reviewer about the subtitles. I found them quite adequate and funny, and the choice of words doesn't pull any punches."
4,Great Kung-Fu,"This is a great Kung-Fu flick with some pretty impressive fights throughout the movie Yuen Woo-Ping style,While it can't touch some of his action masterpieces like TAI-CHI MASTER or FIRE DRAGON,this movie contains a healthy nouurishment of well choregraphed fight scenes.While it is a rather silly movie(especially if you own the english dub) it does have good cinematography,be warned though this is a sort a women's rights movement type of movie being that the women fight superior to the men,which isn't a problem in some movies,but with Donnie Yen co-starring it kind of dissapointed me (althogh Donnie has some great scenes as well).In all not a must buy,but definitley should be checked out by any Yuen Woo-Ping fan."
1,VERY POOR- CHOOSE ALTERNATIVES,"American bashing is for pedantic cave people. Regarding this book, it is perhaps the poorest language tool for acquiring Czech on the market. It might look nice in its package, and Lonely Planet might lend confidence in the product, however my review comes from 2 sides. From Czech Speakers themselves, and as learner of the language to whom this book was left to me.Let me just say this, if my Czech friends want to have a laugh, they request I bring this book with me to the pub! Avoid this book and demand quality from Lonely Planet, not a half baked product out to suck quick tourist money....."
3,Left with one,"I received two key fobs promptly and after 4 mo one stopped working completely. Still looks new, it was the one I used for a spare. I tried to return it , but I guess it was too late? Anyway, they were in new condition when I received them, just wish it would have lasted longer , because I am down to one remote again.Arrived from time of order on time and I am happy with the one that still works. Just guess it is a toss of the coin."
4,"Overall, Very Good Fingerless Glove","would have gave 5 star, but the Impact padding on the back of the glove starts separating from the glove, after a couple months....."
5,Super Quality,"This discman could not get much better. Very inexpensive, flashy, lightweight, and comfortable headphones! It also comes with an AC adapter (but no car adapter.) The only possible thing this CD player could have to get any better was some skip protection, because if it knocks against anything, it will skip. Fortunately, you really have to hit a big bump for it to skip. Overall though, this CD player is really good."
2,Good price -- short life,"The price is right, and kids drops things, so I went for this. It skips, eventually skipping so bad that it barely plays at all (OK, so maybe it fell out of the backpack a few times too many). A big drawback is that it can't play the cd's the kids make for each other. That didn't matter a while ago--but it does this year, so parents, beware."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS!,This collection sucks! It is not the original artists... it sounds like garbage. What a waste of money.
1,BELOW STANDARDS!!!!,"I, as a student, was utterly dissatisfied with the content from this product. Since STAR testing was around the corner, I wanted to prepare myself and benefit from test-taking strategies. When I flipped through the pages, I realized how much the material was irrelevant compared to the district tests that I take every now and then, throughout the school year. Apparently, it did not at all cover 9th grade material and did not set the bar high enough. However, I am sure it can match elementary to middle school standards. It is unbelievable and absurd how the publisher can actually dare to distribute this straightforward material. When I took the STAR test, I noticed 95% of the practice questions (given in the workbook) were not at all alike compared to the real deal. As a student who reviewed the workbook and took the real test, I urge you not to purchase this ridiculous book or any books from this publisher."
1,under his thumb,"I read this book long before Woody Allen's personal troubles became public. (I've always been an admirer of Allen's films.) It is, hands-down, the worst biography I ever read. Lax is more than reverent of Allen; he is obsequious and subservient. At a very early point in the book, I began to sense that every word had been approved by Allen. By the end, I though Allen's publicist and psychiatrists had probably signed off too.P.S. If I had an option of giving this book no stars, I would have done so."
2,well... at least it's not another Spec Ops game.,"I bought this game on the basis of it's strong family backbround (I have Delta Force 1 & 2 for the PC). I wasn't expecting much for [price] and because it's on the PSone, and I wasn't disappointed in that respect. The graphics are better then the Spec Ops series, but not as good as say, Metal Gear Solid for the same system. The game play is ok and takes a little getting used to. But after playing the original Delta Force on the PC and Soldier of Fortune and Medal of Honor Frontline for the PS2, this game should've been [price]. I suggest renting it first. One cool part is the thermal googles... ala Predator or the sniper from the Navy Seals movie."
5,The Best Lotion!!!,"I've been using this lotion for a while. It keeps my skin dewy and soft and yet does not leave a greasy feeling. As well as it's pleasantly light scent, Jergens absorbs well into the skin and keeps a soft feeling all day. It has all the vitamins that your skin needs to retain it's youthful appearence, with Vitamins A, C, and E. People compliment me on my skin's healthy even glow and I say...Jerkins."
2,Hit or Miss,"I'm sure this product works some of the time, but ours worked for 24 hours and then never worked again. At first I thought we put the pins in wrong, but it actually stopped updating the little clock. I ended up returning it and spending $4 more for something that sounded like it might actually work."
3,it didn't work at first,"I've bought 2 of these exact same ones, one is still working & the other one went bad after3 or 4 years so that seemed reasonable.This one i just got yesterday from amazon doesn't work. The dial turns but it gets stuckat the pins. I noticed another reviewer had the same problem so I'm here to buy another brand.UPDATE: After i wrote the above I took the unit and kept spinning the dial to loosen it up.I plugged it back in & found it WOULD now turn on but not OFF. So i repeated spinning the dial over & over & finally, now it's working properly."
5,Works with Air Conditioner,I use this to turn on my air conditioner before I go to bed every night and it works great. Hasn't overheated yet and I have one of those old A/Cs. And the best part is it's cheap so I don't even really care if it dies after a year but so far it's been perfect.
1,Do not buy junk.,This produce is junk only worked for 3 days. Timer does not trip on and off. I would not and recommend buying any intermatic product you would be wasting your money. I've had three different types of intermatic timers and everyone quit working within a year or less from purchase date. Very disappointed.
5,excellent,"This timer is being used on my outside landscape light system. A cheaper unit came with the initial installation. This one is great and is very easy to change times. Although the picture shows multiple time use settings, I easily removed the extra pins and use it just one time a day."
1,six months,"Lasted six months before failure. This is the third timer from different manufacturer to fail in a short time. Seeing as these are sealed and unrepairable, they must be replaced instead of fixed. After I dissected this timer, the failure was, as appears to be common with these, a failure in the gear train and not anything electrical.I would prefer to use a mechanical timer as it is not unusual for us to experience power fluctuations that confuse digital stuff and I do not want to have to reset timers each time there is a flicker. I guess that I will have to get a real time clock and relay (much higher cost)but at $20 a timer I guess payback would not take long. Pity that manufacturers cannot understand that consumers will pay for quality, but are not willing to pay a premium for shoddy goods."
1,Be cautious,Keeps very poor time. I have to adjust the time once a week as it gains or loses between 30 minutes and an hour per week.
4,Too hot,"For this product, I ordered it to control my electricity.This product is designed to save energy. But itself consume about 2W power while the device is disconnected from it. This 2W power make it warm or hot on the electric outlet."
1,A Disappointment,"I must have received a defective batch - the bubbles were just ordinary soap bubbles. They didn't last any longer than any other bubbles. Also, the bubble wand in one of them came apart before I even had a chance to use it. All of the other reviews are so positive that I can only conclude that I got a dud!"
1,probably a good product but...,I rated this low because I never got the product. I ordered it and it kept getting delayed. Finally after two months I had enough and cancelled the order. Not likely Amazons fault but beware!
2,No base,"This boom box has no boom. The size is right, the appearance is right, and even the weight is right. But as far as quality sound, it's not there."
3,Very average,"Stan Lee had a very good grasp on the Hulk in Volumes 1 & 2 of the Essential Hulk series. Once he turned things over to Roy Thomas, the stories went downhill in a hurry. Repetition drove me crazy: ""Why is it always so hard for Hulk to think?"" is repeated in nearly every story.Also, Herb Trimpe's art is average at best. There are a number of different inkers to go along with him, but this is not a great version of the Hulk.There are some good stories in here, but overall it's nothing too great."
1,Spare us,"As a professional musician living in Morningside Heights, I am, as usual, revolted by a non-musician writer's precious conception of ""the artist's life."" We're serious, hardworking people, and Mendelson does us a great disservice here."
2,could have been a really good book...,"but one of the primary characters, Anne, is so unlikable, it ruined it for me. She feels completely entitled to a style of life in NY that is affordable to few very...and spends whatver she pleases regardless of the family finances. I could not stand this character-we are meant to see her as optimistic anc charming and naive, but she came off to me as a snob, only the best for her children,, and one of those obsessive mothers who will wind up with a trio of spoiled children who grown into adults expecting life to be whatever they wish it to be.I was rooting against them the whole time, and admit i skipped ahead and once i saw where it was going, did not bother with some of the in-between. also a romance between two other characters is so contrived and obvious yet we are meant to be stunned...if not for Anne, i could have enjoyed this portrayal of the liberal upper middle class and their snobbiness that they see as the oppsite..."
1,It should be called Answers Manual,"The text book is enough to have! this solution manual is very useless!! since the solution manual should have explicit solutions to every odd question! But this so called solution manual doesn't have more than what the text book provides on its back ! So don't waste your money on this ""answers"" manual.In addition, it has so many mistakes in it !!.The Textbook for this ""ANSWERS MANUAL"" is EXCELENT for applied math students."
2,They were NOT new,"I paid for NEW DVDs. These had been viewed, or copied, several times and were scratched and dirty.At least they weren't broken."
5,Wm and Mary,Show was quirky and fun. Loved it. Strongly recommend it for lovers of Doc Martin. It takes about 5 minutes to see the star as a new character!
5,Much Better After Break-In Period,"Monster Turbine High-Performance In-Ear SpeakersI bought these to replace my Sure Ear buds that were about six years old. They had great sound but the wire covering finally got brittle, which exposed the wire.I thought long and hard about spending this much money, but the reviews were good so I bought them.I noticed in other reviews that you need to break them in for up to 100 hours before you get the best sound. I plugged them into my iPod and played music for about sixty hours before using them. The sound was good, but still not up to my Sure ear buds. I probably have close to 100 hours on them now and they are very good. I would like a little more base, but other than that the sound reproduction is amazing and they fit well in my ears.Love them.Update - The cable frayed, so bought Klipsch IMAGE S4 Earbuds to replace them. I like the Klipsch earbuds better and they are less expensive."
3,It's not as good as expected.,"I would say senheisser cx 5oo deliver almost the same quality of sound with lighter bodies. The rubber is very loose. And, i have tried all sizes of rubbers but somehow they are still loose. Maybe beacuse the bodies of the headphones are too heavy."
4,Sweet Rich sound!,I have to say I am really pleased with these ear buds. I got them on a cyber deal for 56 bucks. Once I found an ear tip that fit right the bass and richness of the reproduction just opened up!!! I also own a pair of Klipsch and sensenhizer buds and these are every bit as good. For me it's all about the fit and seal. Great product!
1,Worst Customer Service I've Ever Experienced,"Please understand, the one star I give this product is based mostly on Monster's customer service. I bought my pair of turbines on 12/20/10. They worked fine for 8 months, and then one of the speakers started cutting out. I sent them in 8/30/11 and finally received a replacement pair today, 12/23/11. It took them almost 4 months! During that 4 months I contacted them a number of times only to be told each time that it would be a couple of weeks till their stock replenishes, even though their website didn't mark them as ""out of stock"" as some of the other ear buds were. As I said, the 1 star is for the fact they broke, and their customer service is horrendous, other than that the speakers produce a nice sound. Just be wary that if you do buy a pair of turbines and they do break you may be without a pair for 4 months. Crossing my fingers my replacement ones don't break so I don't have to deal with them ever again."
4,Pretty good,"i got these puppys when they were on sale, i got em a day before i went on a plane, as everyone knows all you hear is the engine when you on a plane so i thought these would do nice. They did better than just nice, theyre perfect, no sound in no sound out, when i play them full blast they hurt my ears, if your looking for some good headphone you seriously cant go wrong with these. BUY EM"
4,"Good, but....","I bought some of these a couple of years ago when the company was just getting popular, before the Beats became popular. My first impression was WOW! They sound wonderful and look cool too. The only negative side to them is the jack that you plug into your iPod, mp3 player, ect. is straight instead of bent which makes it kind of annoying. In my old iPod it actually messed up the jack. From my ipod being in my pocket, it put too much force on the jack and actually kind of ""stretched it"" or something, but now you have to push it sideways to get a clear sound out of both ears... The sound sounds great, but the engineering could have been a little better."
1,"OVERATED, will never buy monster headphones, wish i spent my money on something else","Reading reviews on this monster earphones they have very good reviews. Unfortunately my opinions are totally opposite.Sound quality is great but volume is very low.Bass none what so ever which is very disappointing consdering $40 earphones have more bass and volume which is also nice and clearI have also ordered a pair of Klipsch IMAGE S4, going by those reviews im hoping there much better than the turbines."
1,"After four pairs, still no luck","These sound great for the two months that they work...then the ears start cutting out and they become useless. Call their customer service, wait on hold for 20-30 minutes, and they're happy to take a return. I think at this point their call center knows that the headphones are terribly built and they just spend all day taking warranty replacements.The first two returns, I had to pay to ship them back which didn't sit too well. Once the third pair broke, they started emailing me prepaid FedEx labels. When the fourth pair came and the plastic around the jack came off before I'd even plugged them in, I called Monster and now they've switched me to Beats By Dr Dre, which they tell me are more durable thanks to their flat cable.You'd think that a company that made its name on cables would have better, more reliable cabling in their too-expensive headphones. Here's hoping the Beats by Dr Dre headphones will last longer than these Turbines."
3,"Good sound - but not a good, sound value","I was very pleased with the sound quality of these speakers, and found that they indeed captured the music very well. As far as musical quality goes, they indeed enhanced my listening. Nonetheless, there are headsets with equally good or better quality available for considerably less, and I did not see a degree of performance which would justify the high price."
2,Dissapointed Customer,"I bought these headphones with expectations of being blown away with impressive bass and pure sound. On all counts I have been let down by Monster. The headphones are well built, cables are flimsy and ear tips are not comfy. I also owned V-Modas, Sennheisers, Klipsch and Skull Candy. Though Klipsch cost @ 79 they provide superior sound and comfort. I was planning to ditch them for the Monsters but no more. I am sticking to my Klipsch's. To get the same level of sound and bass from the Monsters means me having to use the triple sleeve ear-tips and pushing them as deep as possible into my ear canal. Rather uncomfortable after a few minutes of use. Save your money folks and look elsewhere until a redesign is done."
5,Speakers in your ears... literally,"These ear phones are amazing. As the title of the product says, they really are speakers in your ears. Once you find the right fit with the various ear pieces, these little babies fit snugly and shut out noise pretty well. Put on your favorite tune at a nice volume and Bam! It feels like you are sitting in front of a giant speaker. I've on had these for about a month so far so I can't vouch for the reliability/life of these earphones, but it comes with a carrying case to help it last longer if you choose to take care of them."
4,Great Quality for the Price,"I bought these at the $70 price point and they are worth every penny. They easily match up to the audio quality of my Monster Beats in-ears and even surpassing them in areas:Audio Quality: The bass bumps, the mid's are clear, and the highs soar. These are a great pair of mid-range in ears for a great price.Build Quality: These things have held up for years with no issues. I accidentally ran them through the washing machine and dryer and when I pulled them out the headphone had separated a bit but the wires were still connected. I let them dry out and glued the case back together and they work perfectly.Cons: The only issue I have with these at all is the stupid cord. It's prone to twisting and once it gets bent in a certain manner from wrapping or whatever it really doesn't want to straighten out again. Also with the majority of in-ears if the cable is bumping against something it will be quite audible, similar to a stethoscope."
1,this is heart breaking,copelands last cd was phenemonal expectingthe same from this i realy hoped but i was wrong this is a terrible follow up.hey figure out what whent wrong and get us again with better music
1,IT'S 2 BIG,"THIS MP3 PLAYER IS SO BIG, BUT SO BIG, IS ALMOST THE SIZE OF A BOOKI REALLY DON'T LIKE IT.A SMALL MP3 CAN GIVE YOU MORE, A LOT MORE, IS JUST 2 BIG TO BE PORTABLEI HATE IT !!!"
1,Misrepresentation,"This toy does not specify that you have to blow it up for starters. Once you finally exhaust yourself and take it outside, it collapses due to the cold weather. It is more for indoor use. On the plus side, it is very large and would be fun indoors, but who wants to play in an igloo indoors or in the summertime?"
4,As advertised,This product is convenient except for the protrusion which is unavoidable. Not practical to leave in place so it requires being carried seperately from the laptop. It is fast and works well out of the box.
1,danger - will crash your computer,"I got the right card from Amazon, that must suck for those other people. But, like some of the other people posting, this Delkin card will crash my computer every time I insert it. The ony way to make it work is shut down the computer, insert the reader and the card and boot up. Then everything works OK. This happens on a Dell Laptop and a Macbook Pro 15""."
1,Nothing but Crashes and System Freezes,I've had this CF reader for a few months and it's become a pain. I can put in the card but whenever I plug in a CF card I get a system crash. I can't find any support online and may have received a bad reader. It will work if I start my MacBook Pro with everything plugged in but that's very impractical.I would not recommend this product
5,Good Commuting Tire,"I have these tires on my xtracycle, which is a cargo bike that i use to make deliveries with. They are have lasted me about a year now with minimal wear- I ride about 8 - 10,000 miles a year. They do well in rain too. I'd recommend them.I ride alot at night. i also use The Down Low Glow by Rock The BikelDown Low Glow Lighting Kit - Two Tubes -Ice(blue), Illumunite Leg & Arm Warmers Performance illumiNITE Leg Warmers and Planet bike lightsPlanet Bike Beamer 5 LED Bicycle Light with Quick Cam Bracket Mount"
2,Too general,"I have just taken the N10-003 exam, and I must say that the questions in this book are too general. The exam questions are far more detailed and involved than the samples within this book. I recommend looking elsewhere for a more complete study tool."
4,Evangelicalism in the Making,"What a Friend We Have in Jesus, part of a series on traditions of Christian spirituality, examines the history of evangelicalism, a belief system that crosses geographical and denominational lines. The author reviews the roots of evangelicalism in British Protestantism of the sixteenth to eighteenth centuries under the influence of Martin Luther, John Calvin, John Wesley and others. He quotes a number of scholars who portray evangelicalism as a significant religious force in Victorian England, leading some to call the 1800s ""the evangelical century.""In treating the history of evangelicalism, Randall provides in-depth chapters on specific elements of the faith such as evangelicals and the bible, sacraments, prayer, and ""the last times."" With its inviting format and clear style, this work is an important resource in light of the current popularity of evangelicalism in the U.S."
1,PG-13 STRIKES AGAIN!!!!!!!!,seems as though each supposed horror movie gets lamer and lamer in the race to get kids money.taking an R rated horror movie and toning it down for the wee ones.............why bother?!?!?!?the only good thing from the original was adrianne barbau.
3,Beautiful nature but no plot,Beautiful landscapes. Ocean is unforgetable. But many technical details and false poetics
1,...hit the MUTE button...,"...Sure, the surfing footages are gorgeous and inspiring, but as a movie trying to convey the soul of surfing, it fails. Most scenes and situations bordered between the absurd and laughable, as was the dialogue. I found myself wishing the filmmakers wouldn't take themselves too seriously. Watching this was like hearing Laird Hamilton wax poetics on why surfing is good for the soul (boring!!). Give me the guys over at Mavericks anytime. They never talk about soul-searching. What they experience out there on the waves are hard to put in words. Being didactic about any activity that is life affirming and joyous is mistake. Forget this film and rent Bruce Brown's The Endless Summer, which mangaged to say all that and more about surfing with so much less. Mahalo."
4,Where's the CD,"Excellent! But, I would love to have a sound track CD! Only saw the last 40 minutes and will definitely catch the rest."
3,has a liittle problem,"the movie freeze in some parts, but is ok, still runing. and the quality is ok. I think bc is a old movie, not that popular"
5,Great Product and Great Price,I didn't want to spend a lot of money on a projector and was thrilled to find this ViewSonic (especially on sale). My office uses it for presentations and it works perfect. It is easy to use and the quality is great for doing our PowerPoints and Internet education videos. I have used a more expensive projector in the past and I truly like this one better. I highly recommend this product.
5,Get that Drive in movie experience,"I bought this projector for ""Movie in the park night"" with my grandkids and friends. it is wonderful. I got a Blow up screen, and was ready to go. We live in a town to small for dirve in's, and this works great. would recomand this for anyone. My grand kids love it. The picture is bright , clear, better than expected."
4,a decent projector... the dlp color separation is a little annoying,"i've had this for over 5 years and so far no build burnout. but i'm super careful with making sure to not move the projector while it's beaming, not to unplug the projector before the fan has finished cooling it off(after you turn the power off), and not leaving it running when it's not really being used. so far so good. my only complaint - which probably has something to do with the fact that this is a lower end (ergo cheaper) model, is the color separation you see when watching a moving and moving your eyes across the picture. this is a probably with allot of dlp - however from what i've read the plus side is that the picture quality will remain the same versus lcd projectors where the picture quality fades over time/use. for the priced, i'd recommend this projector for most lower end uses(it doesn't do HD)"
1,Intermatic Timer 8111C,"After about 3 months, the timer failed to turn on at the programmed times for the 2 table lamps connected to it . Then the bypass thumb wheel on the top of the timer goes off 30 minutes after turning it on. I would never buy another Intermatic product."
2,Loose the red/green pin and it does not work...,"The device surves its purpose, it turns on my lamp, it turns off my lamp - no big deal. Only problem I am facing right now is that it is useless without the pins... yes, loosing the pins that flips the switch makes this device a paper weight... So don't loose the pins like I did."
2,You sent low end (wrong) item,"I ordered lamp AND APPLIANCE TIMER, AN UPGRADE FROM THE lamp timer (NOT FOR APPLIANCES ALSO) YOU SENT. You should have enought experience to be able to send what you show/advertise."
4,Riveting.,Compelling words and eclectic tones you will want to share with friends. It really makes you think...
1,THE WORST!,"This is the worst coffee maker I have ever owned. I've come to expect that inexpensive coffee makers won't last very long (nor will expensive ones, so why bother spending alot), BUT this one is just awful. The carafe design is such that you cannot pour without coffee spilling all over the counter. The basket that holds the filter does not fit right. Its got a clock... big deal. Don't waste your money."
4,A must-see for Sinatra lovers,"Ian Hart is very charismatic as a small-time night club singer who, as the title says, sings ""strictly Sinatra"" tunes. He does this surprisingly well and turns out an impressive performance in this small, sweet movie. It's a very good film, especially if you enjoy the music of Frank Sinatra, whom Ian Hart's character (Tony Cocozza) completely idolizes. Brian Cox rocks, as usual, playing a mob lieutenant. Hart endears himself to the top mob boss who likes his singing. There's also a cute romance included and a wonderful, uplifting climax with Hart singing ""My Way"". Check it out, I'm sure you'll like it too."
5,Enterprise,Working for oneself can be much more challenging than merely having a job. Ed Rigsbee is a successful entreprenuer who is willing and able to teach the rest of us how to make it all happen. His book offes a series of forms and checklists to simplify the task of creating one's enterprise. Highly practical.
5,Where does he get this stuff?,"Honestly, every time Terry comes out with a new Discworld novel I wonder if first, he can do it again and second, where he gets the wild ideas from. What I always end up doing is getting a feeling that the Discworld is a familiar place, notwithstanding the complete flouting of the laws of nature as we know them.For example in this book, the major subtext running through the book is the need of Sam Vimes to get home in order to read Junior his story every night at bed time. I am a recent Dad myself and identify completely with that need to be there with the nearest and dearest despite all the obstacles work and life can throw at you.I think that is why I love Pratchett books so much, that he can take an extraordinary world and make it feel like you might live there."
4,Good times!,"Thud! was a good read. Thankfully it had a bit more substance than some other Pratchett books I've read (though I've enjoyed them all). The humor is never side splitting, but you do tend to have a smile on your face throughout most of the book."
2,What a disappointment!,"My first experience with Pratchett was last year's excellent ""Going Postal."" My advice is to read that book and forget about ""Thud!"". ""Thud!"" has a few funny moments early in the text, but it soon becomes far too serious -- and far too boring. I have nothing against serious fiction, of course, but Pratchett seems to have lost his muse with this book. There are too many uninteresting tensions: between Sally and Angua, between the dwarfs (should be dwarves, I think) and trolls, etc. I only finished it because I hoped it would improve. Overall, this book was a grave disappointment."
3,An excellent jump start for creative clowning.,"Shaffer takes the reader through the liturgical calendar year, and gives some great ideas for holiday related clowning. The skits presented have their limits because they are all silent. But they will give you ideas on what you or your clown troupe can do. Each holiday also has additional idea banks that will get your creative juices flowing."
1,Madacy Sucks,"One star minus one star=zero stars!Buyer beware. Madacy sells the bottom of the barrel product. Bad remakes (90% of the tracks) and poorly mastered originals (the remainder). Waste of money unless you want new versions of classic records. Just note: even then, they aren't very good.The worst part of this company and their marketing is they lead you to think you are buying original recordings.Don't waste your money..."
1,horrible not horrifying,"the stupidest film ive seen in a long time,wish I could get refunded to watch something worth my money, made no sense"
4,Pretty good accept the dubbing isn't that good.,"It's got comedy, romance, action, and adventure. The problem with it is the dubbing. They mispronounce many Japanese names and words. I suggest you buy the subtitle volume instead or the DVD so you can have both and the raw japanese."
4,A good start into creating self-patterning yarns,"I eagerly awaited this book because it includes a cute ""watermelon with seeds"" self-patterning yarn formula. I wasn't disappointed at all. I wish there were more books in this sub-topic of as I'm a sock knitter and I really appreciate using self-patterning yarns because they're fun and interesting to see ""unfold"" as you knit. I look like a knitting genius when I give my socks as gifts which is big plus (cause I'm not).I spin my own yarn and wanted to branch into more detailed dyeing techniques, but you can use a dye a commercially-made sock yarn, if you prefer. ""Yarns to Dye For"" provides the methods, color schemes and examples to start down the road to creating your own self-patterning yarns. I gave it a ""4"" only because I want MORE and this book is more about the author's examples than branching off to making your own creative yarns."
5,A delightful book!,The is a wonderful book for a child who struggles with his/her fears. I bought it for my grandchildren age 5 and over and think they will enjoy it. I believe it communicates a sense of courage and self-confidence.
5,AWSOME!!,"this was by far one of the best posters that i have ever bought! has captions for every letter, and information for many ages! Very fun to count with kids and try to figure out what letter the animals or various things are!"
5,Excellent Remixes!,"I kinda hesitated in the purchase of this single and my decision probably was mainly based on the fact that it was an import. This single made me appreciate ""Staring At The Sun"" a bit more. I mean I wasn't a big fan of it before, but this CD opened my mind. Anyway, great mixes (perhaps as dance mixes to some) and a good b-side ""North And South Of The River."""
5,Beautiful Book,"I ordered this book for my two sons as they love reading, this is the most magical book nothing beats Winnie The Pooh a real classic, going to buy more for gifts."
2,Slow,"Product came quickly and in great condition, but the mini-series itself was a bit slow. Probably won't watch it again."
4,Tin Man is a Steal,"Just when you think you are over the rainbow you end up in a prism. This parallel to the Wizzard of Oz takes you to places your munchkin minds wouldn't expect to go. All characters are well scripted and the Scarecrow as a zipperhead is a stitch. The Lion as an empath and the Tin Man as a sheriff also work. Toto as a shape changer is also a nice touch. The only characer I has some problem with was Dorothy. She always seemed lost, and not just in The O.Z. I will watch it again and maybe change my mind about her but this mini is well worth the buy."
2,"Great Movie, Poor disc","The dvd was not scratched but still froze and much of the mini-series was unwatchable on an average dvd player. Even on a very high quality player it froze completely during brief periods of play that made watching very tedious.The story was fun and exciting, drawing numerous parallels to the original Wizard of Oz while retaining a unique and engrossing storyline with interesting differences."
2,too long,"Loosely based on the Wizard of Oz, Tin Man has a good cast and everything to be enjoyed by the family: a fantastic magical world in which the good sister, DG, has to overpower an evil witch that took possession of her sister Azkadellia; friends (Cain aka Tin Man, Raw, Glitch, Tutor); mad men (The Mystic Man); and the bad guys of course (Zero).However, this television mini-series in 3 parts is simply too long, 2 parts would have been just fine. It just keeps dragging on and on. The good thing is that there are no useless repetitive scenes; from 1 part to another, the writers didn't feel the need to summarize what happened previously. (Thank you!)The acting isn't that great, but it works for most of the actors' performances.The special effects aren't very special either; nothing worth mentioning.Tin Man is enjoyable, but just drags on too long, which made me long forward to the ending - which was predictable of course."
5,Excellent movie!,"I love this video. Jump forward from the Wizard of Oz. The main characters are great, and much tongue in cheek humor is one of my favorite things. Love this movie! Zooey Deschanel is one of my new favorite actresses. She does an awesome job."
4,Time-of-use water heater timer,"It was fairly easy to install if you do any of your own electrical work. I set the timer to come on at night when electricity rates are lowest. I save some money and don't worry about when I use hot water. The timer is mechanical so it gets slightly off time. I have to adjust it every few months. You only have a daily schedule so you can't put in a different weekend. Overall, I'm quite happy with the unit and have bought another one for the cottage."
2,no trippers,"the trippers are missing ,,,what a pain,,ive got to try and hunt down some trippers,,am trying to contact the company,, but they hung up on me,, dammitt"
4,Water Heater Timer,"I finally hooked this up after buying it about a year ago. I agree with other reviewers that the instructions aren't too detailed but I was able to figure it out. I only had to buy 2 strain relief grommets and 3 feet of 10-2 wire for less than $10. Connection wasn't too difficult, I flipped the breaker, pulled the fuse from the box near the water heater and checked it with meter to make sure it was dead before working on it. I followed the directions exactly and the only hard part was fitting the wires behind the little screws in the timer box and then tightening the screws without cross-threading them or the wires coming out. Our program in off at 10PM and on at 5AM so I don't know how much money we'll save yet. I'm eager to see what difference this thing makes."
4,Works great!,This product was easy to install. I have prior experience with this in another home and it saved about 20% on my electric bill!
3,Good for pork bellies but very little on stocks,"Mostly concerned with the commodities and futures markets. Interesting, lots of charts and tables, but the only information on stocks is a table on page 87 showing that from Jan 1897 to Dec 1983 the Dow Jones Industrial Average posted a gain 68.1% of the time the day before an important holiday and 52.2% of the time the day after. Good to know. It was something I had already recognized, but knowing that the day before is significantly better than the day after is worth while. Also Monday is the worse day of the week for stock prices. There's even a book entitled Don't Sell Stocks on Monday(1986) by Yale Hirsch."
2,Not Good,"""In Her Day"" is feminism at her worst. The story follows the romantic tryst between Isle, a 20-something activist zealously fighting the cause for women's rights, and Carole, the experienced, 40-something art professor who has figured out how to choose her battles wisely. Together the two argue women's ideologies. That's about it. Add a cast of quirky-but- lackluster characters and you've got a novel doesn't amount to much. There was just too much opinion and not enough emotion. There was nothing human about the characters that made me care about them. Definitely not a good read as I labored through it far longer than I should."
1,Watch Out!,Watch out for this vendor who will not take returns! I tried on this garment and found it did not fit properly. When I returned it I was told they would not take it because it had been worn or washed. It had not! I am appalled that I am now I have paid and have nothing to show for it! This vendo is not reliable.
2,Bustier busted,The first time I wore this busiter the plastic support wire popped right out in the middle of dinner sticking out under my underarm. Not good.
2,Very Disappointed,"I read some of the reviews about this product and most of them were positive and only one was negative so I thought I'd go ahead and order this product. The product arrived quickly. I tried the QT bustiere on and found not only was it extremely uncomfortable but it didn't look the product pictured on the site. I doubt I will order from HerRoom, again!"
4,A masterpiece in the making,"F. Scott Fitzgerald's final novel, left uncompleted because of the author's death, tells the story of Monroe Stahr, a hotshot Hollywood producer facing his mortality and longing for a second chance at love. The Hollywood sections, which were informed by the time Fitzgerald spent as a screenwriter, are wonderful, featuring the snappy dialogue and fast pace of a screwball comedy from the 40s. The prose in the romantic parts is a bit overheated and sappy, but no doubt that would have been improved by the author had he lived. A brilliant scene near the end, in which three children encounter the wreckage of a plane crash, makes me ache to read the novel that will never be."
1,Copuldn't Get Movie to Play,"I was dying to see this movie, especially after all the great customer reviews, but my DVD simply would NOT PLAY on my DVD player. Be careful!"
3,I know of better ones,"This is a decent Bible, but Lutherans (like me) should DEFINITELY check out the Concordia Self-study Bible instead. It's actually a heavily edited version of this Bible, and I agree with the commentary much more. It even has quotes from Martin Luther! My other favorite is the New Oxford Annotated Bible. I think you'll find that others agree with me. It's a staple, and probably the best Bible version ever published. Check those two out instead. This one's a little bit too legalistic for me. Any Bible commentary that ties the Wedding Garment parable into good works (??!) is too legalistic for me! It isn't even that hard of a parable to interpret.Catholics, try the New Jerusalem Bible, another big favorite of mine, although I don't agree with everything in it. (Why should I? I'm a Lutheran.)BTW, the Concordia Self-Study Bible works for Lutherans of all types, not just Missouri Synod Lutherans. I'm an ELCA myself."
1,Important errors worth considering,"I was looking for a good study Bible that was easy to understand. I read the reviews and really thought that this was the one for me. Then I read the review from Miss Harris in Orlando, FL. No one seemed to find her review helpful, but she got me curious to see what, in her opinion, had been misinterpreted. I looked up Acts 8:37 in the King James version and then in the NIV Women's Devotional Bible I had JUST recieved. This verse was not misinterpreted. It was completely left out!! It just skipped from verse 36 to verse 38! The same with Matthew 18:11. Not there at all! Were the editors just trying to save space or what? I personally want to experience ALL of God's word. God has a different purpose for each one of us, but he gave us his Word as a handbook for life. Shouldn't we be sure we have a complete version?"
2,Boring Study Guide,"God forgive me, I love the word but when it comes to studying anything or any topic I have a short attention span. This book lays out the actual words of the bible above half a page of footnotes. I found it very boring. I gave my copy of this book away after buying it for a seminar.I would recommend the ""Quest"" study bible or the ""Journey"" study bible. These two I own and have found them to be in simple and understandable english."
2,Greenline BC-704 Shimano beach cruiser,"Really nice looking bike, but from the chainwheel up, it is cheaply made. The one I got was the midnight blue color. The instruction manual is just as cheaply & poorly put together as the bike. Once I got done assembling the bike, I took it for a couple of short rides, but just didn't feel comfortable. Thank God for Craigslist: It took a few weeks, but I was able to turn it over, & was able to use what little money I netted back for accessories to turn my aged mountain bike into a more town-friendly cruiser, and for medical treatment to have my head examined for buying a bicycle online, unridden & unseen. I have no doubt that the construction of this model beach cruiser is just as shoddy. BEWARE!!"
3,"Half are great, the other half, not so much","The small backs are wonderful, they do the job. The larger backs won't stay in place for me, and they don't sit propoerly on my ear. They seem to tip so that they are almost horizontal by the end of the day. It's weird and hard to explain. Suffice it to say that I don't wear the larger ones because of this issue."
3,A Review,This was an interesting book with many surprising twists. Entertaining. The characters are likeable. All in all a good weekend read.
3,Disappointing,"I was really disappointed in this book. The premise was terrific -- two decades after the disappearance of her little sister, Caroline Winters sees a photo in a magazine that looks just like her missing sibling. After putting her life on hold (giving up Juilliard in favor of serving drinks in the Big Easy), Caroline must decide whether to give up the half-life she has in favor of finally discovering the truth about her absent sister.The problem was that I didn't care about a single person in this tortuous narrative. Caroline is self-centered and immature; her remaining sister Madeline is a two-dimensional cut-out, and their mother is merely words on the page. The most compelling figures are the women Caroline works with in the bar, and they serve only as window dressing.While it's a quick read, it really wasn't worth the effort for the lukewarm denouement."
3,Frustrating,"I was so frustrated at this book because I don't know anyone who would do this, although if they did I would be ecstatic for them. It is a good easy read though."
4,Laughs!,"We liked this movie very much. I think that the director was trying to share the experience of not knowing a language that is spoken around you and didn't subtitle the French. Since most of the movie is in English, this wasn't a fatal flaw, but it would have been nice to know what was being said when French was spoken. I heard 2 days in NY was also very funny and want to watch it."
1,bad,"I loved before Sunrise/Sunset, was hoping for something like that. This was uncomfortable, sorry I saw it."
3,Sniveling by the Seine,"(2.5) Sometimes more unpleasant than funny, '2 Days in Paris' brings out the differences between a New York couple who visit her native Paris. As the trip reveals serial lovers in her past, his resentment grows, especially as he takes her scenes with others out of context. Not entirely different than 'Conversations with Other Women' with two different points of view (although not presented with a split screen), this film reminded me of a substandard 'Annie Hall'. Adam Goldberg is no Woody Allen, but Julie Delpy does bring some depth and complexity to her character. When circumstances bring about confusion, it's very funny. When the characters start to whine, they neither inspire nor entertain."
5,Great For Hydroponic Grow Lights Indoors,"Works great with hydroponic grow lights up to 1000 watts. Made out of thick plastic that protects from water drops. Much better when working around water indoors than standard heavy-duty indoor timers. Once you see it, you'll appreciate that it is really heavy-duty. I've used the same one for close to 10 years.As for the review about the timer not holding up outside. I think the reviewer had the electrical cord at a greater height than the outlet on the timer. When ice on the cord melted, the water travelled down the cord and eventually reached the timer where it caused a short."
3,I never saw it,"I never saw it so I am giving it 3 stars unless I find out I was charged for it, then I will give it 1 star. The picture is cool and the nape is short and easy to type, Day X is the greatest movie I never watch."
4,excellent accessory,This was exactly what I expected and the performance for the price was fantastic.
4,"Great Game, not as intense as i thought","when i got this game, i couldnt wait to beat on people, then i started to play. it is lots of fun, but not with a lot of midway twist. sure, you can punch people on the bases, but thats it. no other way to entertain you when you want to hurt people. get blitz or hitz instead. still a great game though :)"
4,Well Worth The Money!,"This was a great buy! I've recently switched from Quark to InDesign (with no official training!) and this book helped a lot. It isn't the most detailed, it's not a bible, but it does deliver the ""killer tips"" that are so very necessary to working with this program day in & out! Yes, a lot of them are common knowledge, but it was worth the money for the dozen or so that are not to be found anywhere in the help menus, you know the ones that make you giggle as you realize how much time you're gonna save!"
3,His/Her Vintage Bathroom Art Prints Bath Wall Decor,"As a print, this one fulfilled its promise of offering a nice touch to a bathroom. The colors were mild and not obtrusive."
4,finally,"Ok, so all the other reviews are whining about the lack of special features. Personally, I love these movies, they were the definition of Sci-Fi horror, well, until the AVP wastes.But I have never watched a special feature, nor have i listened to a director's commentary. I just don't care about those things. I simply want these movies. This pack has them. if you want to own these movies, this is a GREAT deal.If you care about what the director ordered for lunch on the 5th day of shooting, then spend twice the money and get the special super pack. If not, this pack is for you!"
5,BA collection,"if your looking for the best alien and predator collection this is it. sure there are 2 new movies coming out on blu ray soon (predators and an alien prequel(so i hear)) but get the collection started right. true fans need this set. dont wait for the blu ray collections. too expensive and the quality of alien (1), and the first 2 predators is like watching the old star wars. just not a lot of technology back then. movies are great, effects hard to come by. BUT... get this set. cheap, fast delivery(super saver, like 5 days). the only downside is the box the dvds are in. its really flemsy, like cereal box flemsy. but if you dont care about that because your careful with your toys anyway like me then it wont matter. great deal and worth the money. almost a third of the price of the alien anthology blu ray set and you get all 8 movies, not 4. get it, bottom line."
3,Mildly disappointed,"There is writing on every page but it's still basically in tact. It makes it kind of hard to read the text around all of the writing, but I am thankful to have the study and the words are visible so I won't complain, but honestly speaking it could have been better. But the price was fairly decent."
2,101 Strings - 100 Magnificent Melodies,"This 8-CD collection features pretty good selection of instrumental music from theAmerican Standard Library. Since I am used to the good quality of stereophonic sound of the Readers Digest recordings, I was a little bit disappointed with thiscollection"
3,Good Graphics/Lacks Plot,"The art is really awesome, but the stories are short and simple. The character and idea of the book are good. What it needs are longer, more complicated stories.If you're buying it for the art, it's good, but if you're buying it for the read, it's not worth the price."
3,excallent,"This book is good because ,it was a book that actually kept me interested .Also because of all the action and the drama that the mother went through with her daughter .Like some of the problems she went through of cassie doing all the weired and creppy stuff she would do liketalk about killing her parents.So thats why I really liked this story and I think other people should read it."
1,Absolutely absurd,"The argument that it ""doesn't matter"" if she said yes or not is absolutely absurd. It's the title of the book! If actual facts are irrelevant why not title the book: ""She said yes, in Latin, and then spat in his face!"" And even more troubling, where was this ""god"" in the library? Waiting for everyone in heaven? Having lunch with Santa? How many innocent people have to die before people drop all the religious mumbo-jumbo and have the courage to face life and death and evil with reason and responsibility rather than magic and fantasy?"
2,Strange,"I find it rather disturbing that so many people seem to applaud Cassie's parents for basically forcing her to conform to their religious beliefs as part of their ""tough love"". So is it wrong that she was interested in the occult and dressed in dark clothing? Did she need to be forced into accepting Jesus Christ in her life in order for others to see her as a upstanding normal girl? I believe that people should be allowed to make their own choices in life, especially when it comes to very personal things like religion. I think that this book has its merits in describing the life of an interesting young woman, but I think it is more interesting to see how her parents reacted to her earlier lifestyle and how that reaction is a shadowy reflection of the mindset that seems to have driven her killers to do the things that they did."
1,Shameless exploitation based on a misunderstanding,"As many of you know, the very premise of this book is wrong. It had been shown that Cassie did NOT say what she was credited with saying. She did not stand up to the killers with her strong faith. This means that the very reason for writing the book is gone. Both the authors and the publisher were aware of this before they printed the book, YET THEY PRINTED IT ANYWAY.This is a sad attempt to capitalize on the Columbine shootings and promote Christianity. But truth cannot come through lies."
5,She said YES!,"""she said yes"" is one of the best books i have ever read. It is inspirin to me as a teen. Its not a religious book or n*e*thing like that but it tells u how she over came her troubles with satan and found a new light with God. I think every teen should read this book. Its awesome read it!"
2,Brilliant example of Christian myth-making,"As a contemporary demonstration of how religious myths are created, this book has no equal. When this book was written, the authors undoubtedly believed that Cassie was killed because she affirmed her faith in God when it mattered most. They wrote an extremely moving and loving book, intended to be nonfiction. Millions of people now believe the myth, though objective evidence is now quite clear that it was another victim who said yes -- and was promptly spared, not killed. Read this book as an awe-inspiring exemplar of how powerful myths are created and believed, even when they are precisely opposite to the truth. Read it as a tribute of a loving mother for her daughter. Read it as a story of the trials of growing up in modern America. Read it as a cautionary tale of how easily religion can induce believers into falsehood. Read it as all of these, and more, but I suggest that you not try to read it as the true story of a Christian martyrdom."
1,Cretinously vile right-wing Christian pabulum,"This shameful piece of fundamentalist-propaganda-for-dollars is exceeded in fatuousness only by those unthinking reviewers here who embrace it.""... God shall send them strong delusion, that they should believe a lie."" II Thessalonians ii.11."
4,4' utility table,I received my table very quickly and it is just as advertised. It is cosmetically pleasing and is much sturdier than I anticipated. It is perfect for the need I have. I am very pleased.
5,Couldn't Put it Down!,"Very fast-paced, action-packed thriller set in beautiful Greece.Believable characters acting heroically, second to second, to save their lives while they hunt for sunken treasure!"
3,Instuctional DVD,"This dvd is excellent if used for what it is intended, Support material for a DIR class. Although it demonstrates amazing dive technique and gives a good idea of valuable skils, the only way it would be effective is whith direction from an instructor and the other material that belongs with it.If you are looking at getting this DVD here and are not taking a DIR course then look at getting either of the next two DVDs from 5thD-X.For example Intro to technical diving has all the same skills plus a few more and actually breaks them down a little better.Good dvd in context."
5,Details,"Amazon doesn't have track listings, so here they are:Planet Caravan (Album Version)The BadgeDomination/Hollow (live recorded 11/12/94)Great little CD. Worth it for domination live."
2,"Painful, but a learning experience.","Don't bother with this one unless you're a fan of truly bizarre, illogically constructed, yet somehow random plot lines. The wild characters and the occasional poetic turn of phrase serve to (somewhat)redeem the randomness. Perhaps the author's most insteresting device is his use of a first person protagonist who is entirely unsympathetic--but the interest doesn't last. I frankly didn't care what happened to the guy and was glad when he got out of my life."
2,Boring Stories of A Slacker,"Well, we learn that people are people even while in a luxury hotel...not too surprising. And we learn that Anonymous is a rather pompus lazy fellow who likes to sleep and drink on the job while feeling superior to the guests.Not too surprising that fellows like that exist.Surprising that I spent my time on it, though. Save yours."
1,"she has great cred; law, ph.d","i read, skimmed hoping to find something worthwhile. alas, i had just read paul auster's ""the Brooklyn Follies"" it has half the pages and yet it has more heft. i was in the mood to waste time and that's what i did. the cover photograph, though, was really beautiful."
1,"STAY AWAY, NOT THE ORIGINALS","Stay away from this freak show, a lot of these are not the ORIGINALS, the artists and titles are the same, but the songs are a ""horror"". I have all the original records on this CD, and I'll give you 2 examples, ""Heartaches By The Number"" by Guy Mitchell, and ""Go Jimmy Go"" by Jimmy Clanton, I don't know where they dug up these versions, but they're horrible. STAY AWAY!!!!"
1,1st edition and plenty of room for improvement,"O'Hara's book is the only one I've been able to find on Sun lore. Since I had no other information on solar-based pagan religions (i.e. Slavic) this was a good start. The selection of ""stories"" collected is pretty diverse and broken down into tales of Origin, Solar Dignitaries and Other Tales. There are also 2 (short) cool indexes of solar dieties listed in the back. Unfortunately despite all the information packed into this book, O'Hara's retelling of the tales isn't very good. She doesn't retell every tale but instead just sums it up. Some sections contain interesting information on the dieties, but I wouldn't consider it a story. This made the reading dry and boring. It feels like it was written in a passive voice. I would love to see O'Hara revise this book and either get permission to reprint tales from other books or interview people and get tales from the ""source."" All in all, a good book to own for information, bad for reading."
4,Leaves from the Fig Tree,An interesting account of a life spanning two vastly different continents. Entertaining and well written. Definitely worth reading. Would recommend this book.
4,Journey of self-discovery,"Charming and poignant story about an elderly couple, Cornelius and Christina Chapman, who have spent many ""summer vacations"" in the small town of Willard, New Hampshire, who now decide to stay full-time. Christina becomes close friends with a local woman, Ellen, and much of the novel is about their developing friendship (it's a rocky relationship, much like the terrain in which the book is set). Interspaced with the developing story are journal entries kept by Christina in which she steps back and evaluates situations occurring with Ellen, her husband, her family, and the world of Willard. Sarton is an excellent nature writer and her descriptions of rural Willard throughout the different seasons are excellent. Christina feels at the end of the book that by living permanently in Willard ""I am close to my real feeling now,"" and that she and Cornelius have come into their own. A very appealing and uplifting story."
5,CD CASE,I have used this case for many years and decided I wanted another one. This case is great and will protect my CD's. It is the best on the market.
3,good product at this price,this is very good product at this price. Its nice handy and protects your mobile nicely. However there are 2 problems with this case.1. the Belt clip is not very tight and have very little grip on the belt because of this your case can be ejected from the belt with a little push. It fell down couple of times even if you're doing a brisk walk.2. There is no magnetic lock or button lock on the upper flap of the case because of this your mobile can flip down if you're moving a little fast especially walking or running.
4,"Unbalanced, but worthwhile","This record isn't Aphex's best, but it definitely has its moments. Some tracks that come to mind are Xtal, Green Calx, and Heliosphan, which all seem to have the same relaxing vibe. Another favorite is Tha, although it took me quite a while before I could appreciate it. The latter part of this CD was kind of a let down, mostly nondescript. SAW 85-92 showcases Aphex Twin's roots well, and is a worthwhile purchase for any Aphex fans. If you're looking for an introduction to his work however I'd suggest I Care Because You Do or the RDJ album."
3,Jesus IS NOT God,I didnt have to read this book to know Jesus is not God. I already knew that. He is the son of God with a divine connection to God. But I find it totally amazing how so many today believe he is. If you dont believe me listen to the words of contemporary christian music. The singers interchange the 2 all the time. I did read this book and found it very interesting. but it really didnt tell me anything I didnt already know. but I do recommend the book for the history it contains.
2,Okay but not great,"The photos aren't the best, they are dull and look like most were laid on a scanner. Most prices are too high. I'm new to jewelry collecting and selling so I'm expecting good information and clear photos. I'll probably keep the book but wouldn't recomment it to anyone."
3,It could have been a good movie but...,"Yes. I am one of those husbands who are unmoved by chick flicks. My wife hates my attitude. ""Wicker Park"" is a chick flick that I loved.Now for the bad news. They cut the film in such a way that it became incoherent. Not even my wife could make sense of it at times, and she is an expert at this sort of thing. They lost me after the second time they jumped to the past and from then on I was a marginal observer.I liked the idea used in this film, having been in a similar situation which caused me to be 5 years away from my wife. Oh, it ended well, no matter what.This movie could have been really great. Please, don't get me wrong. It is a great romantic movie, but I just don't like a constant shift to the past and complicated things made just to impart an intellectual aura.You may get lost, but stick to it. You may want to see it a few times just to make sense of it. In either case, it will be a good thing to do."
1,Not Worth It,"Such false advertising! All I have to say is that this is a pretentious, esoteric piece of crap trying to be a ""European"" film. I understand it may be hard for actors Josh Hartnett and Rose Byrne's age to find quality work, but wow.Pretty much, nothing happens in this film. The flashbacks and left-out details make it seem like much more is going on than it actually is. Our sympathetic villain(s?) really aren't that threatening as they try to break up a relationship the audience really isn't invested in in the first place. Don't think this is Fatal Attraction or even Sea of Love. These actors have better performances in other movies, so go buy those instead."
1,Hollywood muder of French Art Film,"I've seen the French movie ""L'Appartement"" and I must say that it is beyond comparison to the Hollywood remake, ""Wicker Park.""Wicker Park is so bland and ineffective no thanks to the wooden performances of Hartnett and Kreuger. They just don't have the mystique and appeal of Vincent Cassell and Monica Bellucci which made the original film really interesting.The Hollywood movie is actually a ""happy ending"" version of the French film. The ending of Wicker Park totally deviated from the suspenseful, climactic and tragic conclusion of L'Appartement and instead offered a glimpse of happily ever after for the love story of the two leads.Think Hans Christian Anderson's original take on ""The Little Mermaid"" and Disney's sanitized, happy version of the said fairy tale. That's what ""Wicker Park"" is, a ""Disney"" version of L'Appartement."
2,TWO ships passing in the night!,"REALLY A STUPID MOVIE THAT MAKES NO SENSE... AS IN COMMON SENSE! I MEAN... COME ON IF YOU SEE BROKEN HEELS AND THE SAME COAT ON THE FLOOR OF AN APARTMENT THAT BELONGS TO YOUR GIRLFRIEND...(ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU SOLD THE SHOES TO HER)... DO YOU JUST SAY TO YOURSELF...""OH IT'S COINCIDENT""???? AND TO BE NAMED LISA TOO...YA RIGHT...DUH STUPID! THIS MOVIE IS VERY HARD TO FOLLOW AT TIMES TOO FOR THE FLASHBACKS ARE ALL JUMBLED! AND LAST BUT NOT LEAST... IF COMMON SENSE DOES PLAY INTO EFFORT...THEN WHY THE HECK DOESN'T THIS SO CALLED LISA CHICK JUST GO TO MATTHEWS APARTMENT AFTER TWO FRIGGEN YEARS OF LOOKING FOR HIM...PURELY LAME! EVEN TWO SHIPS AS LARGE AS THE TITANIC COULD NOT PASS IN THE NIGHT AS THIS MOVIE MAKES THESE TWO CHARACTER DO!...OR SHOW I SAY... DID!"
3,Still not black and white.,"This is just another chance for consumer photo labs to throw mediocrity at you.If you process b&w; film yourself, it's fairly cheap and takes well under an hour, even if you develop three or four rolls at a time. It's not hard to set up somewhere where you can develop film, that's what blackbags are for.And printing black and white on color paper? Doesn't sound like a good idea to begin with. Especially with the pinkish tint, you're never going to get ""black and white"" from that."
1,"BEWARE: NOT THE ORIGINALS, AND LOW QUALITY","Bought by mistake, not noticing that Countdown Singers was the performer. Not only re-recorded, but very poor quality musical arrangements of the songs. The only tracks that would not cause the listener pain are the ones that were unfamiliar. The only reason to purchase this would be if you were actually a fan of this particular group of performers."
1,awful,half of the DVD'S didn't work. It's become a roll of the dice to know if I'll have a recording or not.
4,80's Instrumentals?,"This album is actually pretty hard to describe, except to point out that it was made in the 1980's, which was not a very fertile time for covers of Beatles songs. I think Michael Jackson had bought the Beatles catalog rights, and very few covers were being produced, except for jazz covers of ""Blackbird"". Kids were breakdancing and listening to Lisa Lisa & Cult Jam...Topping the charts were instrumental tracks like Jan Hammer's ""Miami Vice Theme"", and Harold Faltermeyer's ""Axel F', and you can feel echoes of those hits here - a couple of these tracks could find a home on a ""Beverly Hills Cop"" soundtrack, if they wanted Beatles covers in those movies...Dicola & Young's ""A Day in the Life"" sounds like the theme to ""Flashdance"", as recorded by the Thompson Twins...I guess most of these tracks are more accurately described as ""Modern Jazz"", which I got no kick against, but the influence of the 1980's is definitely felt here."
3,"charming, but ...","I love Miss Read's books, and this one is completely charming. The only reason I do not give it 5 stars is that this edition (kindle) is littered with typographical errors. So many misspellings take away from the pleasure of reading! Miss Read would not be pleased."
4,Realistic,"Looks realistic. The only complaint is it would tilt to one side in the pond. Looks realistic and everyone got a kick out of it.**** Update *****So a little update. I've used it on an off. It is great and will start up a conversation a few times. However, the paint is peeling pretty bad now. I do not leave it in the water often, so not sure what is causing the paint to peel."
2,"Close, but not the same","I was expecting original recordings when I ordered this set. Three out of 100 were the original. Many of the remakes were acceptable, but nevertheless a big disappointment. Deceptive advertising for sure."
4,Country Collection,"First of all, these are not original versions. Original artists yes, just not original versions. Some are better a couple not as good, and most more than acceptable as re-makes. It is certainly well worth the money. Great to hear these songs again."
3,"Decent condition joystick, sliced wire, bad packaging","All in all I am satisfied with this purchase, the controller works, and that's all that matters, and I knew it was used. Still, I expected a used, good condition controller, this would barely pass as fair. While the most important thing, the joystick is still in usable condition, many other parts of the controller show a lot of ware, the gold is rubbed off towards the bottom of the handles, and the cord had a big slice through it about halfway down, it was poorly covered up with cheap electrical tape. The packaging was less than impressive as well, shipped in a cheap very thin bubble envelope, which I'm sure lead to some of the damage on the joystick. All in all, seeing as there are few other alternatives, if you really want a gold N64 controller than this isn't a bad way to go, but don't expect the highest quality, and be ready to return it if it gets smashed during shipping."
1,Why?,"Recently my instructor had all students read a copy of this book, when asked why he had no comment, the only reason I can even fathom is that the book was so bad that he doesn't want us to make the mistake of going to Villari's."
2,Disappointed,"This was a new three disk series. I bought it as a gift for my mom. The 1st and 3rd disk work beautifully, but the second one halfway thru digitally stalls and will not run. We tried it on two DVD players, it is flawed and pretty much makes the series incomplete. I am sadly disappointed. But recieved it quickly and view it a fluke."
3,Great performance.....but lousy early digital sound,"I agree with the comments made re: the excellence of the performance, but be forewarned that the recording is all too typical of DGs recording problems of the era.specifically, there is digital glare on the strings. Lots of it. Perhaps it was cleared up in subsequent remastered versions (ie, the re-release of the complete cycle) I don't know. but if you're playing this on a good system, you'll hear a lot of scratchiness in the strings.Otherwise, it IS a great performance!"
3,Better Live - watch out for Copy Control,"Theses girls are all quite talented and I saw them live at the start of their tour. It was a great night and they played with and off each other. The material is weak which is typical when good singers try to write all their own material. Writing is nice, not performing mediocre material is better. Better to be a great singer than an average singer songwriter, in my book."
4,this is a great book for kids who's parents are re-marrying.,"this is a great book for kids who's parents are re-marrying, even if thare not re-marrying! it's great!!!!!!!!!"
2,Outdated - Would not recommend,"The book has some basic information on the neighborhoods of London, but I bought it for the information on specific lodging, which was outdated. I am going to return this book."
2,Dull blades,"I use a standard safety razor for shaving, and I have been shaving exclusively with the Merkur double edge super platinum razor blades for a few years. So, since those are the sharpest standard blades that I have found, I expected these trimmer blades with the Merkur name to have similar sharpness. Suffice to say, I am most disappointed. These blades are not even close and are actually quite dull.To verify this, I specifically compared the sharpness of these blades on properly prepped skin. Whereas the standard double edged Merkur blade always glides smoothly as it shaves, the trimmer blade catches and hesitates on every single hair.In short, I am quite surprised at how bad these blades are."
5,Times Comprehensive Atlas of the World 11th ed.,Altogether an exceptional Atlas - far better than anything current (including the 8th edition of National geographic).I do wonder why Alaska and Northern Canada only warrant a 1:12 500 000 scale when the rest of the world (literally) recieves at least 1: 5 000 000 coverage.A minor complaint really and not enough to rate less than a full 5 star rating.Dr JPNightingale
2,Fell apart for me too!!!,It is beautiful to look at but birds can't land on it or it will tip (it's like a booby trap for birds). Squirrels are too heavy for it and tear it apart. The day after I hung it I looked out in the yard and saw a squirrel carrying something off - thought it was a hot dog or something. He grabbed it and ran over the fence and gone. They had knocked it down and ripped off the bottom piece of the feeder that connects to the base. Somehow my husband found that piece and glued the feeder back together. We have learned not to put any food in in but to hang it and enjoy it's beauty.
5,For under $25 it can't be beat,"I work in an industrial workplace, where any radio has to take its chances with getting banged about, so I don't want one that I'll scream in horror when I see it smashed. This Casio (...) fits the ticket. Durable enough to stand casual bumps and tight enough to keep the dust and dirt out of the innards. The radio recieves the full range of local AM/FM, even through the steel and concrete walls of the building. The cassette player is smooth, the door stays tightly shut, and it has clear reproduction. The volume can be nice and loud, with no loss of fidelity, for when the background noise is intrusive. The built-in mic works like a charm. Battery life is fair, about what you would expect out of a couple of AAs."
1,Don't buy this boxed set!!,"As a big fan of 60's music, this boxed set by""The Original Artists"" looked too good to miss. The CD's however are labelled ""To obtain the highest possible quality, these tracks have been re-recorded by the original atrists or members of the original groups"". What this means in practice is that the tracks sound nothing like the originals that we know and love. I shall be returning mine as soon as I finish this review."
3,WORTH IT FOR 'HUNTING HIGH AND LOW',"I found this album disappointing, especially given the high standard set by ""Stay on These Roads"" and, in particular, ""Scoundrel Days"". A bit too much of the quirky and rather unmelodic technopop for my taste -- BUT the title song is subtle, affecting, even haunting, and beautifully crafted. To me, it's what a-ha is really about."
2,Unbelievablly Entertaining,"I have never read a book that struck me so close to home as ""Virgin Gloves"" did. It definetly made me feel like there were others who have the same feelings as me. It was also nice to see the way that Alex Hutchinson was able to really express his characters. I was never really a fan of boxing but now that I know more about the sport I have started watching it with my husband who is now reading the book. I would definetly recommend this book to everyone, as it could fall under so many different types of literature. It is non-fiction/fiction, romance, sporty, educational, and eye-opening. ""Virgin Gloves"" has the ability to make the reader want to learn more about the basis of the book."
2,What a mess,"This book will never stand on its own. It attempts to introduce far too many ideas in too few pages. It's a lot like Cliffnotes. Used alone, the reader will be left with a skeleton of concepts and ideas...The book is a muddied introduction to the organization, history, and sociology of the state. Ideas are dumped, not explained. Half of the names appear in only one sentence. It left me unable to remember or care about some of the 50+ names. Sections are seldom coherent.I ended up using the TOC to draw up my own organized outline. I filled in the pertinent details using wikipedia and ca.gov. And I paid attention to the newspaper. It worked much better."
4,The Raise of the Fraconphonie,"Thre is no doubt about the fame of Moliere in France and many countries. He represents this part of the universal history when some countries in Europe decide to improve their national lenguages. Shakespeare in Elizabeth's England, Moliere in France and of course Cervantes in Spain.Today nobody can doubt about the fame of Shakespeare or Cervantes... But apparently the french writer came late in reafirming the importance of the french lenguage.The movie remind me in moments the awarded movie ""Shakespeare in Love"". Similar topics: ambition to be known and respected by the society, love and romance; and of course you need to include comedy.It's a good movie and a good way to try to rescue the french lenguage."
3,For Moliere lovers only,"I liked the movie but want to warn you that a knowledge of Moliere's works is very necessary to appreciate the humor. If you aren't familiar with the plays, you will probably think this movie is fairly boring. If you know some, especially two: Tartuffe, Le Bourgeois Gentilhomme, you'll love it."
5,RES - You go Gurl!!!!,"I'm keeping this evaluation short and sweet...Just take my advice, buy the album. If not, then you are missing out on one fabulous vocalist of the century. She is truly amazing! Her music is extremely beguiling, unique and her style will blow you away!!! Take my word. ONE LOVE, Coco Pe Benito (Washington, DC)"
4,Another Under-exposed Artist,"This album is almost perfect. Res (along with her producers, of course) creatively blends rock and r+b, but it's not contrived. Too often artists, Ahem! Ashanti, try to incorporate rock music elements such as an electric guitar to give their songs and image an edgy exterior. Res doesn't do that. It is obvious that she is influenced by many styles of music. Unfortunately, this is probably what keeps artists of Res' caliber (and color, frankly) off the radio, especially for a debut album. Best tracks: Golden Boys, They-Say Vision, 100-Mile Situation, Ice King, Let Love, & Tsunami."
4,Res (Pronounced Reese),"Res released a dynamite CD last year to critical acclaim, but probably twelve people (myself included) bought it. But, seriously, it's a pretty good collection from an artist who refuses to be boxed into any one category. Some people might lazily box her into the neo-soul camp, but the truth is that Res also dabbles with rock, pop, reggae, and a little hip hop flava with varying degrees of success. The end result is one tight groove that makes this one of most underrated releases out there. Give this CD a chance, and the music will richly reward you."
4,Beautiful,Enjoyed this beautiful music. Quality of the CD was excellent. Some dances familiar. Glad to have this in my repitoire.
1,1950's Rock N Roll Never Sounded Like This,"This is by far the worst CD collection I have ever purchased. After taking off the cellophane wrapper (by then unable to return for a refund) in very small print on the bottom of the box it was noted that songs with an asterisk (*) were original recordings. The (*) appeared 8 times only--out of 100 songs! Note on the front of the box it reads, ""Original Artists"". If these are truly THE original artists of these songs, I need my hearing checked. You certainly fooled me when I purchased this collection! Buyer beware!"
2,El-cheapo,"Looks nice, kind of flimsy in real life. I made a beef roast in it and it warped at 450. Granted, it went back to the right shape when it cooled. Also, stains easily, hard to get back that nice shine."
3,"The Tape Head is down ""troddin""","Unfortunately, this is my least favorite King's X record. ""Groove Machine"" and ""Fade"" are good songs---nice heavy, chunky, harmonies--all signs of a great King's X record, right? sorry, not for this fan. There was something missing(if not sonically) from this album that the King's X records from before contained. ""Soul"" and ""Cupid"" are decent songs but are redundant. The same can be said for ""Higher than God"" and ""Hate YOu"" The whole record seems more negative than Dogman, but at least Dogman had real guts behind it. I may get trampled on from my fellow fans on this, but this is the truth of how I feel about ""Tape Head"""
1,"Love King's X, but ... one word for this album ...DULL","First of all I am a big fan of this band. However, this CD left me greatly disappointed. It is not immediate or catchy except for a few songs - that unfortunately, after a few listens, emerge as false hope - for they also leave a lot to be desired. Even after repeated listens on my part in an effort to give it a chance to grow on me, it never did. Maybe for comparison purposes you could say this album is of a similar vein to the self-titled 1992 effort King's X ... but not even in the ballpark. Try Gretchen, Out of the Silent Planet, Dogman, or King's X for their best. I even liked Bulbous and Manic Moonlight, but this one is summed up in one word ... DULL"
3,Half heart,"Saddled with too many undistinguished, sludgy verses but blessed with the sense to still impart some notable choruses."
4,"Liquid Steel, perhaps a Caress?","Hello King's X fans (or those who are yet to be blown away)This band is an example of an overlooked jem. I guess you have to be a hard rocker to get it, but once you do, it seems that you'll be a rabid, honest fan espousing the virtues of integrity, melody, style, virtuosity, raw power and grace all in one - and in every - song.I am one.This CD adds to King's X's incredible library of rock material. The songwriting talents of Doug and Ty never fail to amaze and ultimately satisfy.At the end of the drive, the floorboard doesn't exist. Period."
3,Not that Great!,"A friend of mine recommended this movie to me.Once I purchased it, I was not to impressed.I am not discriminatory against gays at all. But I would not buy a movie like this.If the gay stuff wasn't in it, I may have enjoyed it.I will not recommend this movie to anyone."
3,Real Life,"I was taken a back at the twist to this movie, but it is reality. Forgiveness, healing and loving people is what life is about."
2,My Caregiver Does Not Like Them Because They Unscented,"I bought these for big messes for incontinence care, and when we get the box, we opened up a pack and found out that they were not scented, the did not smell like anything. They should of put on the description scented or unscented. I would have bought scented, but this is all they had for under $40.00. My caregiver is not going encourage to purchase these again. I hope they come out with scented wipes just like the baby wipes and other wipes that they sell in the store. When they make wipes put some fragrance in it! They are boring as heck."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"Thank God I did not purchase this. My cable company showed this on the BBC Channel. It is pure junk and nothing more. No evidence of anything. Of course the Beatles were not perfect, but this is ridiculous. Obviously put together by someone who hates these guys. It's a shame I couldn't give it less than one star."
3,Accompany,"I got this CD when I got the book 'Shout' and it is basically the accompanying DVD. Funny thing is that the book did not talk a lot about the music, and neither does this DVD. In fact it seems that they didn't have the rights to the music so you don't hear even one snippet of Beatles music, just people talking, which is nice but not like it should be."
4,Great value for the price,"Purchased this set almost a year ago and we are happy with the product. Lots of different features. Great set for a beginner. The flaws i have noticed are the foot pedals occasionally give you 2 beats instead of 1, and the pads are not as sensitive as i would like.This Just means i have to play a touch harder. Overall i am Happy and would recommend this product to anyone who wants a decent set for little money!"
3,Pretty Good,"I'm not a drum expert by any means, but it seems to be an OK set. The drumsticks included broke within ten minutes, but after we git everything set up it seems to work OK."
3,Satisfied,This product was purchased for my nephew for Christmas. He has truly enjoed this set and has not complained about anything as of yet.
2,Nobody is perfect?,"This recording fully meets my expectations in terms of excellent technical quality (us usually provided by Deutsche Grammophon) as well as interpretation by Berliner Philharmoniker & Karajan delivering ""golden"" sound. Nevertheless I should point out that this CD turned out to be the first ever for me to hear a serious playing slip by the musicians. The strings are certainly playing wrongly for a few seconds in track no. 6 (Allegro con moto - Trio) around the count of 4'00"""" which caused quite some disappointment to me. I raised this point on the DG homepage and got the following answer on 29-June-2000:Quote""A playing slip?"": You are right here. However, it is most likely that Karajan decided to allow the slip to stand because he believed an additional corrective take would not match the overall quality of the performance delivered albeit with that slip.Unquote"
2,Mostly for Karajan fans,"You can argue that the brass in the Karajan-era Berlin Philharmonic were weak and nasal-sounding, but you can't dispute the sumptuousness and precision of the strings. And despite the typically dry and synthetic-sounding production from DG circa 1981, sumptuousness is what we get in both of these well-known works for string orchestra. But is it really appropriate to the music? For me, a smaller and more nimble body of strings, with a conductor less committed to legato phrasing and more attuned to the niceties of each score, serves these Dvorak and Tchaikovsky pieces better. But if deep-pile opulence is your priority--as it was Karajan's--then step right up."
1,"This book covers the topics, not the test.","This book covers all of the topics for this exam as they are are outlined on the MS website, however, it isn't anything at all like the actual exam. I found that a solid understanding of relational databases is far more critical than any knowledge of the Microsoft Solution Framework. I don't know what book to recommend, but this isn't it."
1,Should never have been published,"I don't understand how Syngress had the gall to publish this book before the 70-100 exam was even finalised. As many other reviewers have already commented, the book only covers MSF and has almost no relation to the actual exam. The description of database normalization is the worst I have ever read."
1,Very dull and aparently not on exam,This review mostly just for spite to lower rating. Look for my copy of this book on auctions! MSF appears to be not on exam - that's what this book is about.
1,"Great book, but won't help with the exam","This is a great book if you want to learn about the Microsoft Solutions Framework (MSF). I just wrote the live exam though and it had no questions even indirectly related to the MSF. The exam is not really a knowledge-based exam. It tests analytical ability more than anything. Unfortunately, even the ""knowledge based"" questions I had were not covered by this book. The cd does a good job of testing the material covered in the book, but again, the real exam uses the new Microsoft test format (testlets) and mainly uses the new question types (e.g. build a list). So the cd doesn't prepare you for the exam either."
1,Good Book But Not If You Want To Pass The Exam,"I just came back from the 2 hour MCSD 70-100 exam. Not a single question on the exam is covered in any of the content and documentation listed in this book. This book is a good reference for those wanting to learn about MSF (which all true MCSD's should) however it does nothing to prepare you for the exam. After 2 weeks of studying the different MSF frameworks and methodologies I was rather disappointed when the test didn't ask any questions about them. The stupid and obviously fake test review questions that accompany this book are even more misleading, not too mention poorly worded in many instances. I will be contacting the author and publisher to that effect."
5,Learning What It Means To Be Human,"In this story of a human attempting to bridge the distance between his species and the alien atevi who dominate the planet, Cherryh is dealing with a favorite subject and one that plays to her considerable strengths of characterization and complex plotting. The depth and reality of her worldbuilding is unmatched, as usual. A great book by a wonderful author."
2,Benefiber is better,I tried this because it is less expensive than the benefiber...but...this gave me pretty severe cramps and then gas. So I am back to the benefiber.
3,Read Between the Lines,This paperback* is useful as a cheap (book can be purchased at a deep discount) means to get an idea of what occurred in Missouri during the first part of the Civil War. Phillip's attempt to psychologically profile General Lyon with today's sensitivities provides the reader with comic relief in this account of some of the darkest days in our history.*note: one needs to be able to read between the lines of Phillip's politically correct revisionist slant on history.
4,Elephant Song - bloody...,I've read all of Wilbur smith's books and although I really enjoyed this I found it a bit too bloody and near the mark for my tastes. I prefer my imagination to do the work and not have too much graphical details.
3,An enjoyable and interesting read,I felt this book was an easy read. It did deal with some graphic details but these are very much in character with what my impression of Africa is like. I think Wilbur A.Smith is a great advocate for many of the problems in Africa and he is a great advertisment through his books for his country and indeed this is why his books do so well. The story line is decieving when you initially read this book and can grab you in a very graphical way. The story is a little like a roller coaster which has some very step hills and some very quick corners. The story is predictable in a certain way but dosent really tell all because of this. I would recommend this as a read for a train trip or even a plane trip because if you are afraid of travel you would not have time to be scared. An easy but interesting read.
3,good but not his best,"if this was the first wilbur smith book I read, I may not read any more but he has written some top notch epic adventure fiction like birds of prey and 7th scroll.in elephant song the characters fall a bit flat and the story line is a bit simplistic."
3,Not the Best Comedy DVD,"Ron White is a stand up comedian known for his cigar chomping, scotch drinking shtick, and is a part-time member of the Blue Collar Comedy Tour. He can be very funny with his southern, drunk humor. This DVD, You Can't Fix Stupid is average, at best. It runs just over 40 minutes long, which isn't much for the price of a DVD. And while it's mostly funny, it's not nearly as funny as some of his previous stand up routines. The saving grace of this DVD is that it's new material and you can always watch a DVD like this and get a few laughs."
3,FUNNY BUT DIRTY,It starts really funny. Some very smart lines like can't fix stupid - so true. But it's too filthy and too much reliance on vulgarity.
1,Ron White's video is terrible!,"I am VERY disappointed in Ron White's video - it was full of talk about his member, and nothing else. What it reminded me of, is a drunk man at a bar hitting on a woman, the whole time bragging himself up to make himself feel better in a futile attempt to take her home.If it would be possible, I would ask for a refund. This is the first - and last - video of Ron's that I will buy."
3,Skin and Lt Benson's Dad,"The plot is about reviving the spirits of the dead and doing evil and so forth. There is a lot of skin and sex in this and Law and Order SVU's Mariska Hargitary's dad Mickey plays one of the leads. His other offerings, Delirium and Bloody Pit of Horror are better, but if you expect to much from this, you won't be let down."
2,Vinegar vinegar vinegar,If you're like me and avoid Tabasco sauce because it basically tastes like salty/spicy vinegar then you definitely want to avoid this one. It has some ok heat to it but the displeasing taste of vinegar assures that you won't want a second bite. I'd recommend avoiding this one as popular as it may be.
2,Disappointed,"I can't hate on Joy Division, I absolutely love them. That's the only reason this gets more than 1 star. The audio quality of this vinyl was pathetic. It looks pretty, but not good for much else. Might turn into a high-end coaster."
2,purple vinyl,"To be honest I'm not sure why this exists. There have been some reissues of Joy Divisions 7"" vinyls, such as ""An ideal for living"" and ""atmosphere"". This isn't a reissue, as these two songs never were issued together in the first place. The mix for both of these songs are different from the ones you are used to hearing, and not as good either. Oh, and My copy came on transparent purple vinyl."
2,"booklet, not book","While this book has much value,fun, and good content, be aware that it is a booklet of 32 pages compared to Draw Squad and Kistlers Imagination Station: Learn How to Draw in 3D. They have about 250 pages. You will get more for your money in terms of more lessons/info with the other 2 books."
2,Can not use that which does not arrive,Ordered the product June 17th never arrived. Notified Life Industries on July1st and they responded that I complained about the problem before giving them a chance -now it is the night of the 5th and not one word from them
1,A sloppy piece of work,"Over half of ""Reasons"" is a promotion of the so-called ""creation science"", where MacDowell spews forth a number of arguments to try to discredit evolution. As a scientist, I was appalled to read this section, because he was so wrong on many points! MacDowell has used ""evidence"" which was completely discredited well before he wrote the book; he has used irrelevant points and misleading arguments; he has attempted to expose ""serious problems"" with evolution but failed even to acknowledge that there are even more serious problems with ""creation science""; he has ridiculed evolution for past errors which have since been fixed yet failed to see that he's using creationists' errors that haven't been fixed. These are unacceptable in any book which claims to show the truth.MacDowell asks, in the book, why more scientists don't accept creationism. The miserable scholarship in this book is a sample of the real reason why. This, I'm sorry to say, is a book to be avoided."
3,The Quiet American,Audie Murphy is one of my favorite actors. I didn't know anything about this movie before I bought it but it's probably my least favorites of anything I have seen of his.
5,A lovely set of nature appreciations,"WHY BUFFALO DANCE: ANIMAL AND WILDERNESS MEDITATIONS THROUGH THE SEASONS offers a lovely set of nature appreciations musing on everything from the lessons of eagles in 'The Right Timing' to a Spring celebration in 'The True Nature of Things'. These aren't the one-line meditations you've come to anticipate in such celebrations of life, but thought-provoking essays linking observations of nature with seasonal inspiration.Diane C. DonovanCalifornia Bookwatch"
4,Great gift book,This is a charming little book which is lovely in its presentation and soothing in its lyrical vignettes. It makes an excellent gift for someone who lives outside the frenetic energy of suburbia... or for those who wish they did....
4,Works OK!,"Attachment works well but unfortunately it's difficult to find a nozzle that will withstand the high heat of these professional dryers and not fall apart. The ""teeth"" become brittle and break off. Nice price and it lasted longer than most attachements. Would recommend especially, if you don't use extreme heat."
2,Missleading information,"Sure, this book looks good at first glance. Unfortunately, there is a lot of missleading or wrong information. For instance, in use case diagrams, the extension points are shown in the extendet use case, not the basic use case. The close relationship between sequential diagrams and collaboration diagrams is not explained. Also, the relationsship between operations in class diagrams and messages is not covered.I got the impression, the author of this book has never partitipated in the development of object-oriented software. If you like to learn UML but not object-oriented programming this might be the book for you. Otherwise, you are better of for instance with Martin Fowler's UML Distilled."
4,It is a good self study guide for UML,It is a good self study guide for UML beginner. It tell you the most importance in UML and teach you how to thinking in Object Oriented method.
2,"Nifty, but not all that great","I had admired this for a long time prior to purchasing it. It may be because of all the build-up that the end result it such a let down.To be fair, the knives are of good quality; not the best, but by no means are they a total waste of time.The construction does leave much to be desired though. The base is rather cheap feeling, light-weight plastic, and the chrome paint/layer they put on should be a bit more durable considering this model costs $30 more than the others.It IS nifty, and it IS attractive (for now.....) but I could not recommend this purchase to anyone else..... As a matter of fact, I'll probably give it to the first person who comes to visit and seems truely taken with it."
2,not a good recording,"I am disapointed in this recording. The levels vary widely with long stretches of faint music and voices (typically the chorus) then you get blasted by a soloist. If the metropolitan opera can get it right on a live saturday broadcast, then a studio recording should be able to as well. Also this production seems cold and distant. A good production should come across like rich dark stained glass. If you want a good recording tape the met broadcast of this opera. Now if I can just find my tapes from the eighties."
5,Love it!,"My daughter loves this. She had a parachute party for her 2nd birthday. We played Ring-Around-the-Rosy, popcorn, and cat and mouse. The kids love it when the adults shake it and the kids run under. It is small enough to use in our living room with the furniture pushed aside. The colors are more ""neon"" than pictured. The green is a lime green."
1,abstinence propaganda,"This might as well be an ad for abstinence. It seems geared to creating fear in those those who have ""sinned"". It sells the believe of living a perfect life, which i dare say none will achieve.The disappearance of the universe is a far more interesting book and the underlying philosophy."
2,Accounting Guide - I fear not !!,"If it's an ACCOUNTING guide you want, then this book is not for you. If it's a FINANCE guide you want, then buy it. I was hoping it would have more strictly accounting advice like how to read a balance sheet, what a profit and loss statement is, what is a liability, etc. It hardy touches accounting, concentrating more on the finance side of starting up & running a business, eg. business plans, cash flows, types of companies, tax, etc. The book however is easy to read & understand but I feel should get rid of the ""accounting"" term in the title."
2,The Complete Idiot's Guide to NOT Finance and Acounting,This is a nifty tool for starting entrepreneurs and business owners...but not for those in search of an actual guide to FINANCE AND ACCOUNTING
5,Professional Pet Assisted Therapy,"The author, Pearl Salotto, has written a book on the profession of pet assisted therapy that is not only comprehensive but also warm, loving, and compassionate. Anyone interested in the human/companion animal bond in general and pet assisted therapy in particular will greatly benefit from her knowledge and experience in this field.Included in Pearl's book are articles and chapters on pet assisted therapy programs with numerous populations such as people who are elderly, people with developmental disabilities, people with mental illness, and people in hospitals and nursing homes. Of particular interest are Pearl's ""Respect for Living Things"" programs for children.This book opens the reader's minds up to the numerous ways that our wonderful family therapy pets bring smiles, joy, life lessons, and healing to participants who are young and old alike.This is a book that you will want to read and have on your shelves as a reference for many years to come"
3,"Good, but not as great as the first two books.","I gave five stars on Blackwood's first two novels, because they were excellent. Great plot, great characters, great storyline. I was less than impressed with this book however. One of the reviewers stated that there was poor editing, which is true. Early in the book, Johnathan Root is described as a man in his early seventies that has been retired from the CIA since the eighties. Later in the book, Root is describing his involvement with Kestrel and says he found out about the virus ""in 1978 when I was 30"". Since this book takes place in 2003, that would make him 55, not early 70's, and a bit too young to be retired from the CIA for over 15 years. I saw a few other minor flaws in the book as well. This may seem like nit-picking, but when you're used to the quality of Blackwood's first two novels, it can be disappointing. All in all, the book could have been better researched and edited, but it was still a good read. Looking forward to the next one."
1,great book but the kindle version is the worst ever,"the book is a 5 star for sure , but the kindle version just does not work for me at all, you cant copy any verse if u wish to with this kindle version I rather scan the book and read in pdf much better and also in pdf u can do whatever you want no restriction like the kindle version"
5,mindblowing even if it comes back,"Best book I read this year, took it on a trip to Germany and it was medicine for my conscious awareness. I am planning to re-read it since it has some key points concerning awareness...the hoax of the mind... the subjective looking at the objective trying to 'get things' which is different than a revelation of reality (experience). I feel this is a book of art and the artist has not to be perfect nor does the reader. There are passages in the book that just will make you stop and lavish in revelation. Thank you"
4,Complex,A very complex and thought provoking work. It will challenge a lot of your mental programming. This is an excellent companion piece to Power vs Force.
1,Mister Fan,"This is a cheap, made in China, knock-off version of the personal mister fans sold at amusement parks. Don't waste your time buying one - there is no way to turn them on or off. Seems the idea of an on/off switch was beyond the manufacturer. The vendor was great about this however and immediately refunded my money. I would definitely purchase other products through them."
1,this fan is junk,"I purchased this. Brought it home...put batteries in it, it worked. Awesome. Left the next day for camping in the hot sun, ...and the fan had already broke/ stopped working. I had it packed secure and safely...no damage to the fan or misting bottle. I even put in a new set of batteries to see if that was the problem. Nope. Just cheaply designed , poorly made and basically crap."
1,Fans arrived broken,"Of two fans, one arrived with trigger broken in sealed packaging. I had to pay for shipping to return it. They sent another one, which was also....broken. so i called the company directly and they replaced it. They were much more customer friendly than Polsteins, which I will never use again. In any case, there must be an issue with the trigger. Havent used the fans yet, so can't speak to how they work. yet."
3,Staring at Pop Royalty,"I purchased this chiefly because Level 42 is probably my favorite pop band and I had ""Staring At The Sun"" on cassette, not CD. It is not my favorite Level 42 album but is worth the price because of ""Tracy"" and ""Heaven In My Hands"" (my unofficial theme song). The only real bummer here is ""Gresham Blues"". It's an instrumental that's really tepid, a shame because this band has done some burning instrumentals in the past."
3,"Short mystery for ""Mommie interuptis""","This tiny paperback is perfect for someone who finds themselves interrupted constantly, having to drop the book in the middle of a three-page chapter to attend to a boo boo or to mend a teddy. That said, this book could easily be read in one sitting. The character is likable, even when she shines the spotlight so harshly on her insecurities (being fat in LA four months after giving birth to the baby that won't sleep.) The mystery itself has to be taken with a grain of salt - you can almost here the author at one point debating, ""now how can I get her to go down in the basement all by herself,"" and some plot devices are pretty convoluted. But even if you don't like the book, you won't have to devote a lot of time to it."
2,Oy vey.,"Cliche-ridden and predictable.The best I can say is that it was a fast read, so it ended quickly. Just not my bag."
5,"Malle, Bardot and Moreau: a unique combination","Well, I've fallen in love with this movie when I was 22 and I still love it at 64. Did Louis Malle make any other comedies like this? I don't know. It's a masterpiece by an allround master of cinema giving his hand to comedy. Of course I know all his great 'serious' movies, what film-goer doesn't at my age in Europe. Newcomers please consult the IMDB. ""Show but no substance"" says Halliwell. But then he probably didn't get the satire (very French). And not the unique interplay of Bardot (for once allowed to be as beautifull as sexy and intelligent) and Moreau (who was always the sophisticated sexy one). ""But"" a show? what a show!So I won't give you a summary - you can easily get that at Am.com, but a rating of what interests ME most cf. new releases: This DVD-transfer is ok, clear picture and sound, not restored but acceptable, and I wish I could get rid of the English subtitles."
1,Warning: Terrible Jimi for sale,"I didn't think it was possible that there would be a Jimi Hendrix album that I would advise against, but then I picked up ""19 Great Performances."" ""Sunshine Of Your Love"" isn't bad, but the rest is. The sound quality is poor, and the performances sound tired at best. I don't even think most of the 2nd CD is actually Jimi. There is the appeal of hearing a drunken Jim Morrison, but it's hardly worth the pirce of admission. I gave this away to a friend of mine, and I wouldn't take it when he tried to give it back. Buy ""Live At Woodstock"" instead, which might be the best live album ever."
4,"Oh Keith, you're so marvy!",This is an early book and well seen.You should buy this book because Keith Carter is good for the soul.
5,Classic,"Most know Judy Garland as a singing sensation, but her comedic abilities are put on display to great effect in this film. The opening sequence where she sings on the train ""as the evening sun goes down"" is breathtaking. Granted the male lead isn't too great, the rest of the cast does well. My favorite line will always be:""They call me Tex""-""where are you from?""""Massachusetts"""
5,Refreshing Entertainment,"""The Harvey Girls"" is a refreshing trip down memory lane. Another MGM musical of the 40's. Romance, conflict, comedy, dancing, and music with an underlying message for today. Several surprising plot twists make up for the otherwise predicable story line."
3,Not Great,"I'm sure I would've liked this one so much more if I hadn't loved ""Baby, Don't Go""!!!This is cute, but unremarkable. The characters were undistinctive, the minor characters practically non-existant, and as for Susan Anderson's sense of humor, you might have to look really hard for the jewels of hilarity. In fact, if you find them, let me know."
1,all boring all the time,"Haven't read Susan Andersen before, and based on All Shook Up, won't read her work again. She has only the one plot device -- instant animosity followed by consuming lust -- which she uses with both sets of protagonists! Her plot is so predictable I knew from page 1 what was going to happen. Her characters are shallow, undefined, and unbelievable. Her lead character uses sex to get her male employees to do what she wants, which is totally insulting to all women...Frankly, this was boring, insulting, juvenile, and NOT SEXY."
2,Drags,"Ive read like five books from this author and haven't loved any of them. The beginning is usually cheesy and predictible, the middle gets a little better and then the end just ties everything in a big, unrealistic bow. Also, kindle listed four books in a series, but these are NOT a series. They don't have common characters or settings or anything. I bought the entire series (dumb move) so now I feel obligated to read mediocre books."
1,Fixture doesn't last longer than bulb,"I put this fixture in my vending machines, 8 out of 10 fixtures die before the bulb. I am finding another manufacturer. Less than a year on average. This fixture is ****."
4,Heartrendering!,"Dr. Mahoney has finally provided us with a true picture of the emotional dilemnas that are faced by a veterinarian who has gotten involved in animal research. The lay person who is a vivisectionist, if he has an open mind, can hopefully finally understand ""the other side."" The parallels that this doctor draws between his upsetting work and the love and hope which Molly brings to him is quite obvious. As a fellow veterinarian (who has worked with Dr. Mahoney) I can not adequately express the joy I found in reading this book. Its been a long time since I found a book which I can finally put on my bookshelf next to Dr. Herriot's books! Thank you Dr. Mahoney for sharing yourself, Molly and most importantly your chimps with us all."
5,Frontline Plus - Flea Control for dogs,"Frontline Plus for years has been my favorite to control dog fleas, because it works. I purchased it thru Amazon, and it was supplied by Pet-Go-Here which has excelled in terms of the service provided. I will use the same channel and supplier in future."
2,doesn't work,"didn't work for my dog. it got fleas under Frontline ""protection"" . My dog lives in house and goes into the street just for walk. So, we used Frontline spray back home in Europe and never had any problems. But after using this spot Frontline for couple of weeks I've noticed flees. Immediate extra application of Frontline didn't help at all - it didn't make any effect on insects. So, I finished up using Hertz for getting rid of them."
3,Flea medicine,"I liked the price, and my dog hasn't had any fles so far, but it did stain his fur which the same stuff from the vet has never left a stain?"
5,Never used anything else.,My dog is almost nine years old and I've always used this product. Never used anything else. He plays outside a lot and he's never had fleas or ticks. I would recommend Frontline Top Spot to anyone.
1,THE REASON IS WAS SO CHEAP!,"frontline top spot does NOT kill larvae, or flea eggs. so when you apply yea you kill adult fleas, but in a few days the larvae grow to adulthood, and the eggs hatch to become even more larvae and VIOLA, more fleas! BUY FRONTLINE PLUS TO KILL ALL AGES OF FLEAS, EGGES EVERYTHING, but but but MAKE SURE IT IS A US PRODUCT, OTHERWISE IT CANNOT BE INSPECTED AND REGULATED BY THE EPA. you can get bogus stuff! be aware, do lots of research on seller. they use different names, write their own good reviews etc... YOU CAN FIND GOOD ONES. I HAD A SELLER SUSAN SOMETHING?? SHE WAS GREAT, BUT CANNOT FIND HER ANYMORE:("
5,Great price.,"That product works but it is way cheaper here than Costco.It works great when you have a ""flea bag"" like we do."
4,Pretty good for the money,I just bought this the other day. It is actually pretty good. Camera take pretty good picts. The video is not bad at all. The softwear is really easy to use. Great small size. Only thing is the speaker isn't very loud. I mean you can hear it but it just isn't the loudest thing. So in all this camera is really easy to use. Very basic for the beginner to the person who wants a basic camera to use.
3,Aiptek; worth the money!,"I bought this camera years ago when it first came out for around $120. Now that I have had it for several years I must say I have gotten my moneys worth and then some. I've taken this camera with me from construction sites to vacation destinations and I've been able to get consistently good pictures. Not GREAT but good.It's well worth spending a few minutes learning the menu options and settings because it will make a big difference in your picture quality. Knowing when to adjust for lighting and when to use the flash even helps with the battery levels. I've used every function on this thing and I am happy with the results. It's not meant for once in a lifetime, precious memories but it has served me well as a work horse all this time.Pros -Multifunction deviceLots of options and settingsCompact and light weightRechargeable batteryCons -Poor zoom qualityFlash and Camcorder drains battery quicklysub menus take practice getting to"
3,You get what you pay for,Its basicly a toy. But it would be good to have in your purse or clove box for quick access in situations! The battery lasts a vary long time.It would be a very good tool for kids projects.
4,Great Warranty,"I have been using about a week with no change to the settings, the display looks great. The tilt seems a bit stiff but that could be because it is so new. The height feature on the other hand seems loose but once I set it, it is fine. The three year warranty is nice as well. Mine came with the DVI cable included. The manual is not that good but the online manual seems better. I got it for a great price at another store."
1,Cheaper than Pictured!!,"Ordered this item and promptly returned it when it was apparent it was a cheaper version than the set pictured on the page. The item that arrived had none of the cording trim pictured. Also, the dust ruffle was a plain, off-white color, not the stripe one pictured. Buyer beware!"
5,Only Love Can Make a Miracle,"I love this book. It tells the story of Mahesh Chavda's journey through childhood into adulthood in which he discovers real love, healing and incredible miracles. You won't be disappointed."
1,Not even close to the illustration.,"Ye old ""fitment notes"" strikes again. These are caliper hoses for the front wheels only, not the rear wheels. But not this car; some other one. Amazon would do well to either commit to selling auto parts or get out of the business. Once again, I will eat these parts and they will go to a landfill somewhere because the brake hoses are not expensive enough to amortize the return shipping. The best advice: Read the ""Make sure it fits"" results several times; every word. Invariably, the last few words will describe an application that is not yours, even though nice large print will assure you it fits your vehicle and the picture will look like exactly what you need."
5,Basic Principles of Pentecostal Spirituality,"I have read this book in Japanese translation. Among many books on recent Pentecostal movement, this book, published 33 years ago, is still aglow with its deep insight into the basic principles in which the Spirit of Jesus inspires and leads each individuals to his/her full growth. Compact,lucid,Biblical and penetrating. A Japanese Reader"
4,If this was an egg and spoon race...they would hold there's.,"Man, that was the lamest title for a review, but I just got a little nutty there for a second.I found out about these boys via Myspace.com/theburningseason. Hand of Hope records seems like it's doing a pretty good job for itself since its records are being distributed by Victory. Mad props you guys.So, yeah. They sound sort of like Atreyu, with less poppiness, less singing, and a little more edge. Frankly, that's something that I like to hear.My favorite song is Watch in Faith.If you're a fan of Atreyu, As I Lay Dying, and crappy local metal bands that think that they can be as good as this...haha, then check these fellas out."
1,fraud,unit arrived dead ...no good ...useless...failed...I cannot get a replacement and need to find the box and ship it back
3,"Pointless plot, good music (the 1950 movie)","Nowhere-going musical relies strictly on its star power, with pretty enjoyable performances. Although the plot is among the dumbest that have ever been brought to a musical film, the old songs are nearly sensational and it's fun to see Mr. Cagney dance."
3,Sixpence...,"Let's see. The reason I rated it 3 was probably because some of the songs are just plain weird. But I do LOVE some of the songs, like ""We Have Forgotten"", ""Kiss Me"", ""Amazing"", ""There She Goes"". But alot of songs are so stupid and weird, and the beats clash like crazy, that I hate half of the CD. But, it is worth it to hear those 4 songs.~This is my 45th depressing tune~"
2,A 2 song CD,"The song ""Kiss Me"" is alright but I did not decide to buy the CD until I heard ""There She Goes"" . I love Leigh Nash's vocals on ""There She Goes"" and thought she did a very inspired job. Most of the song's are by Sixpence's Matt Slocum and his music is not a pleasurable experience but more of something one endures through. I think Leigh should go on her own to improve her chance of career longevity. ""There She Goes"" is a cover song released by the La's a few years ago and Leigh does better with this song then with material written by her own band."
3,"Excepting some notable highlights, a snoozer","This CD is reminiscent of the early 1970s, with selections that blend into each other, puzzled lyrics that seek answers and musical style simulating a drugged state. Also like early 1970s albums, the collection shows a boring sameness, which is the chief fault of this collection. With a few outstanding and obviously well-composed pieces such as ""Kiss Me""and ""There She Goes,"" most of the songs sound hypnotically alike, with the same rhythm, texture and guitar riffs, and Leigh Nash's stringy vocals do little to provoke interest and variety from one number to the other. Also, with lyrics that are sweet and moralistic but not strictly religious, it is unclear just how this band qualifies as Christian. The group's promise is clearly there, but it would do well with more excitement, more harmonies, more aural variations. Thank goodness it's a CD where it's possible to easily skip the rough stones and listen only to the all-too-scarce gems!"
2,This cd has no variety.,On this cd all the songs sound the same and out of all those songs only one is any good or a hit and even it is getting old! If they put more variety into thier songs then they would be really good but it just sounds like a bunch of folk songs to me. But if that is what you like thats a good cd for you to get. But it just isn't my style.
5,Buy the Hardbound,"Partly autobiographical, partly a discussion of old time flying, mostly a look at airplanes that marked significant milestones in the development of commercial aviation ranging from just after World War One to just before jets. Gann has flown many, and has obviously talked at length with pilots of those he has not. The hardbound is coffee table size, and each major aircraft is the subject of a one or two-page full color painting. Here are bipes and trimotors, the DC 2, 3 & 4, and a less-than-enthusiastic look at the Boeing Stratocruiser.Readers of a certain taste will be glad to know there are no jets."
4,"Espectacular grabación, pero...","La orquesta suena espectacular. El coro es tremendo, pero me desagrada el vibrato de las sopranos. Böhm toma siempre los tempos más lentos, pero para mi el Dies Irae, el Kyrie, y el Domine Jesu deben ser más rapidos, me gusta el Dies Irae tocado como ""desesperado"".En todo caso, igual es una gran grabación, es solo un detalle de gustos."
3,"Oh, please.","With all due respect to Karl Bohm and the Vienna Symphony, all one has to do to is listen to Robert Shaw's version, with the Atlanta Symphony, to come immediately to the conviction that these stodgy tempi are completely ill-conceived. Nowhere is this more evident than in comparing the two versions of the Rex Tremendae. Shaw's version captures ever so much vividly the image of the awful Judge come to separate the sheep from the goats than does Bohm's fly-stuck-in-molasses weightiness. The flames of the Confutatis positively crackle in Shaw's rendition; here they are tepid and uninteresting. Sure, the sonics are outstanding, the playing first-rate; but this bloodless rendition fails utterly to capture the pathos of this Mozart's final opus."
2,Too slow,"Perhaps I'm biased, but the first version of the Requiem that I heard was conducted by Neville Marriner and it's the only one that sounds right to me.The Bohm version, while the recording quality is excellent and the orchestra/chorus is superb, is too slow for my liking. It is a piece written for a funeral and all but it sounds lurching to me; it still has to move along at some pace and I think the Marriner version does this well, better than Bohm's."
5,Valley of the Dolls,This book is wonderfully addicting even the second time around. I couldn't put down. I found myself wishing it wouldn't come to an end.
4,Proto-Feminist Tragedy,"This book's reputation as trashy ""chick lit"" is undeserved. The plot rambles a bit, but the writing and storytelling are superb. Its characters are well-drawn and engaging. Valley of the Dolls may not be a great classic but, on balance, it is closer to Dreiser than to Bushnell."
1,Valley of the Dolls,"I made it through ten pages of this piece of trash. It's worse than awful, reading as if written by a child who's flunking eighth grade. The words of Dorothy Parker came to mind when I stopped: ""This is not a novel to be tossed aside lightly. It should be thrown with great force."""
5,"Really, really good...and here's why--","For me, the most fascinating part of this book was watching the characters change and evolve, especially Neely. (No spoilers, I promise--that's all I'm going to say!) But just as interesting was the girls' internal conflicts...You can relate to them in a lot of ways. You look at these girls and think--wow, she's like me, or she's just like my friend. You KNOW these people! It's a really good read--I recommend it."
5,Valley of the Dolls,"This book is so good! I couldn't put it down. Although the story takes place starting in the 1940's and was written way in back 1961, it is very modern. I loved it!"
5,Hand me another doll,"Ah...how can someone NOT like this book? It's just so ..well..60's. Chocked full of all that we secretley love peeking into, the life of movie stars,drug dependency,sex and struggling to make it in a mean world and a mean business. Our three main characters Neely,Jennifer and Ann are all self destructive drama queens in their own distinctive way. It offers a panorama view of how shallow life can be if you put your priorities in the wrong things and the grief chasing after these can bring. It really is classic commentary ."
4,Hooked from the first page!,"Excellent, quick moving book. I read it over the course of a few days and was disappointed when it came to an end!"
4,Great for any generation,"I read this book in the mid-80's and again last month. I wanted to refreash my memory before starting the sequel Shadow of the Dolls. This book does not age and it is dificult to believe it was written so long ago! It is a story before its time, as you follow the lives of three young women and the men that fade in and out (and in) of their lives. They face hardships and challenges but always have each other. As with many female relationships, the women have their ups and downs with each other, but still manage to reach their goals and aspirations. The thing is, after they have realized their goals, they discover there is really not that many places to go after that but down. See who goes down, who stays on top and who rises back by picking up the sequel as well. A great beach book and vacation read. Enjoy!"
1,"Um, this book sucks","I purchased this book because it is such a ""classic"", and because of all the glowing reviews, but in my life I have never read such a complete suckfest of a book. OK, so I thought that the out-dated, corny dialogue was charming. But after 100+ pages of Anne, who is perhaps the dullest character ever created, I was ready to set fire to this thing. But I kept on, because I thought surely it must get better. People love this book! Nope. The characters are so painfully cliche and the situations not at all believable. Quite frankly, I was bored to tears. I think people just give it rave reviews because it is such a cult classic. Honestly, it's[...]."
2,"Great Compositions, Poor Sound Quality Recordings For This Era","I really like U2 compositions, but I haven't been able to get a CD with their classic singles that has a clear, rich sound quality. They should record again their best classical singles or just release a Live Concert CD (not only the DVDs). I love their interpretations at Slane Castle Concert, but the CD is impossible to acquire these days. The rest of their concerts are only out on DVD... when you hear their studio recordings from the 1980's, it just doesn't sound good enough compared to the sound you can appreciate with a live recording today on any CD. So if they're still capable of playing their songs, then please let us hear them in rich digital sound on a CD and not re-release their same old recordings that sound pretty flat and weak."
2,It should include their singles.,"This is an OK greatest hits type of album, but since the title includes the word ""Singles"", they should have included more singles. The cover picture just screams for singles from Boy and October. This would have been much better if the less than memorable unreleased songs were left off for more singles. I would recommend getting their other two greatest hits so you get better coverage."
4,U218 Singles,"U218 Singles~ U2 is a awesome greatest hits and if one simply goes on the music it would have easily attained 5 stars. Bono is an annoying person with a severe case hubris and he sticks his nose in issues that he basically has no idea what he is talking about. Which is a shame since if he just stuck to the music he would have realized that one should never ever mix politics and music. Political music is a sorry excuse for true music which is good enough in itself. The book-let is alright but nothing all that great. The cover photo is atrocious and Bono has a hideous haircut and wears a shirt that looks like he dressed in the dark. Even so this is a great compilation of hits and one would wish that the band would just stick to their music since this is truly sublime, with amazing lyrics, astounding production value and Bonos stupendous vocals."
5,U2's Best,"U2 has already released two greatest hits packages that cover almost all of the songs included here, but this release is a nice combination of the two and also contains two new songs. What more can be said about classic tracks like ""With Or Without You"", ""New Year's Day"", ""Pride (In The Name Of Love)"" that hasn't been already said. Also, the newer songs like ""Beautiful Day"", ""Walk On"" and ""Vertigo"" perfectly pair up with the older tracks. The two new songs are also outstanding. ""The Saints Are Coming"" is a duet with Green Day that ranks as one of the best songs of the year and ""Window In The Skies"" is a string laced, anthmatic number. U2 is one of the greatest bands in rock history and this set helps to show why."
5,The Heart-shaped box set is awesome!!!!,"Everybody must stop everything they are doing and buy this set if they do not already own it. If you are looking for the hits they are all here, and if you are looking for rare songs, like I was you are in luck. It is pretty much a greatest hits set. It contains my personal favorite song ""Moist Vagina"" which features Courtney Love and an unreleased track called ""Marigold"" on which Dave Grohl does lead vocals and is basically an early version of FOO FIGHTERS."
4,cable time again,"25 foot of cable for $7.99 seems like a great deal. Like the previousreviewer, I'm using these for monitors.They look just fine for the application. I have not ""hooked them""up yet, but will in the next 24 hours. Any malfunctions will appearas a edited review.I have never heard of Musicians Gear. They sent me a small salesflyer with the cables. Will browse? But I do not need a Gibson LesPaul! [just for the record you all]."
2,Temperamental chemistry!,"Ivo Porgorelich's overmastering personality may be easily mirrored throughout every one of his interpretations, that has led him to become a sort of prophet in the desert due his flippancy. And nothing is more mischievous that to adopt such posture in a world, plenty of new and brilliant soloists. The time has come for him and having the opportunity to watch him in Caracas I could reaffirm my opinion about him.His gelid approaches sin of lack of humbleness. And although his impeccable technique and analytical coldness, I guess he must be appropriate to play the repertoire of the Viennese School of the early decades of the XX century."
3,"Good movie, kind of old style acting, but intelligent","I am not a big movie buff, but this type of movies have something in common--they do not focus on the acting excellence, rather the story itself stands out independent of the acting. From this stand point, I should have given the movie 4 stars. But, I am giving three simply because it had few scenes that are too simplistic to follow in today's movies. Also, it deserves three stars to have the sequence of background story to appear too suddenly and create confusion. Anyway, it seems that few other directors of that era tried to use crime/theft to show a theme about the vindication of justice, or at least a hope for it. The ending is beautifully done and honestly, you will leave with a mystery. That last scene's poetic appeal actually completes the movie. You have to watch it fully to get it. However, you won't miss much if you skip it either."
3,"Good Source, but rather boring","I read this for my U.S. Government class and although I find the topic most interesting, I found the book rather boring. It was very difficult to get into the book, although there were occasionally chapters that struck my fancy, but overall if you are looking for a book on the subject you would enjoy reading, I'd say keep looking."
1,Must have been a dungons and dragons fan,This book leaves you hanging in mid air more times than I care to mention. It also has more errors than any technical book I have ever purchased.
2,"Not really from the ""Ground Up""...","Rather than covering the Visual Interdev 6 interface and tools, there is more information devoted to scripting and objects. The book spends too much time on related information such as CSS, scripting and DHTML which is better covered in other books. The best sections of the book are the chapters on Design Time Controls and how to use them."
1,Nothing but screen shots and menu listings.,"This book contains 622 pages of screen shots and menu listings. In other words, if you would like to simulate the experience of ""reading"" this book, just spend a few minutes clicking around in VI."
1,Waste of space and time,"This book is useless. It spends chapter after chapter covering basic web stuff -- vbscript, html, etc. -- and then skims over how to use Interdev. It contains far too many instructions of the ""click mouse here"" type, and no real explanations of what you are doing or how it should be done. Avoid this book like the plague"
2,There is really no concrete examples --- I had to use MSDN,I do not recommend this book at all. Look for other title
1,Poor Performance = BIG Disapointment,"I was excited about this new product but my excitement was quickly dashed when I began using the product. It promised better performance than any corded or cordless phone but it did not deliver on either promise. Noticable static was constant regardless of how close I was to the receiver. People I was talking to also noticed the difference as they all thought the poor quality was the fault of their own phone, which I knew it was not because all problems disapeared once I switched to my regular home cordless phone. To make sure I did not get a bad phone, I went to the local electronics store and purchased another B100 BlueParrott headset identical to my first one, and it performed exactly the same. Both BlueParrott phone headsets were returned to the retailers and I returned to my earpiece and mini mic for those long phonecalls the make you ears bleed."
5,This book literally changed my life!,"I first read this book almost thirty years ago, and have read and studied it many times since. Yet this book still gives me fresh insights whenever I pick it up.It is about ECKANKAR, but provides many universal truths that can be of benefit to anyone seeking a greater understanding of Soul and of God. Beyond this it gives actual techniques of how to Soul Travel in the spiritual worlds.This book was one of the pioneers in bringing out what had mostly been secret spiritual exercises. Today out-of-body travel has become common knowledge and widely accepted. Paul Twitchell's focus was on teaching these abilities as an aid to self discovery of our true spiritual nature.It's a fascinating look at, and ways to access realms of consciousness beyond this world."
1,Eckankar: The Key To Secret Worlds,This book is a plagarized work and I am surprised that it is for sale. The original authors should be reinbursed for the use of their information in making this book. I feel that people should be aware of this before buying this book.
1,Leary is a thief,"I'll admit, the guy is a good actor. But comedian? NoFolks, Leary copies Bill Hicks down to the last detail. The outfit, the smoking, the way he holds the microphone, and the horribly stolen jokes. He just acts more ""coked out"" than Hicks and speaks in a New Jersey accent as opposed to a Texan one"
4,Courageous and gutsy personal journey on Depression,"I read Ms. Rothenberger's book and was inspired by her honesty and openess in her struggle with bipolar depression. She tells how her illness affected her, her daughter, her husband and her work. What happens when you don't reach out for help? What happens when you reach out and it is the wrong person? How she was fortunate to find an excellent therapist who believed in her and truly wanted to help her. I advise all who are struggling with the illness, or who are caregivers to read this amazing story of victory over mental illness. Ms. Rothenberger also lists resources and support systems at the end of the book."
2,Not Fieldwork,"Although I am not a geologist or anything close to that I had hoped to glean something of interest about the geology of Botswana for a future visit. I had hoped to learn something of landforms, their history and what lies beneath the sand. The book contains not much of interest about the geology of Botswana but offers rather a sketch of what the field worker gets up to before, after and during field expeditions. Some of it is amusing but most is rather poorly described and put together. One gets no real sense of the characters or the places except perhaps of Rileys Hotel in Maun ( which is much different today). There is however, some interesting information about the connection between the seismic activity of the area to the south of the Okovango delta and the African Rift Valley off to the east so I did feel as if I came away with something useful. It also contains a lot of poorly rendered or inaccurate pieces of local language which are an annoyance."
2,Fight of my life is much better!,"When I bought 'Fight of my life' a couple of weeks ago I thought the Insyderz were one of the greatest ska-bands ever. But this release proved me wrong, it's way too slow and the lyrics are bad, too. They repeat every sentence over and over again, as if Christians were a little slow!"
1,"Poor quality, too dark","these DVD's are too dark.Charlie Chan Collection, Vol. 4 (Charlie Chan in Honolulu / Charlie Chan in Reno / Charlie Chan at Treasure Island / City in Darkness) (4DVD)"
4,First in the Toler Series,"After three volumes of Warner Oland's Charlie Chan, my favorite Chan portrayed by Sidney Toler is finally available in DVD. The four movies in this series, pretty much in order of their filming, range from a relatively unsuspenseful opener in ""Charlie Chan in Honolulu"" to a dreadful script and Toler performance in ""City of Darkness"". In between these bookends however, are two of Toler's best efforts, ""Charlie Chan at Treasure Island"" with Cesar Romero, which is regarded by many as the best of the entire series and my second most favorite (next to Charlie Chan in Panama), and the less well appreciated but almost as good ""Charlie Chan in Reno"". Despite the two less forgiving movies it is still Toler as Chan and you just have to go with the flow and forget you had to buy the four togther."
3,Pretty,"This dvd shows the pretty parts of the Cotswolds, of London, Scotland and Ireland, but it is by no means an overall or accurate depiction of these sites. It is further marred by two flaws:(1) I have to think that the hotels where the narrator stayed gave her free lodging in the best suites in exchange for her rather lengthy and lavish praise of the facilities, the views from the balconies, etc. Perhaps some viewers are interested in hotel bathrooms and king-sized beds, but I'm not.(2) Too many guides and docents (and not just with respect to this dvd) feel the necessity to provide snappy patter, little jokes and esoterica, the latter of which is frequently inaccurate. Samantha Brown would be well advised to contain herself from the ""cute"" remarks.The scenery on this disc is quite nice, but it would lead the innocent viewer into thinking that the British Isles were a series of postcard views."
2,"Good itinerary but not in depth, badly edited, & not funny!","On this DVD, Samantha Brown offers a great itinerary of the England, Ireland, & Scotland which she visits during the winter but is not nearly as in depth as Rick Steves' or Rudy Maxa! Her bad jokes that are funny 1/10 times really kill the flow of the show as well. Samantha caters to the soccer moms of America but is more concerned about staying in a fancy hotel and getting a fancy dinner than actually learning about her surroundings. She spends way too much time talking up her hotel & eating rather than showing us more sites or offering any kind of history or background of the area. Just like getting half a meal at a restaurant and wondering what happened, Samantha Brown's programs seem way too short and leave the viewer longing for more information, creating more unanswered questions. For a more thorough series watch ""Best of Europe by Rudy Maxa"" or ""Rick Steves' Europe: All 80 Shows 2000-2009""."
4,British tourism light,Samantha does a good job in the 20 minutes of each vignette to cover the main aspects of the location she visits. I'm sure that there has to be more for each visit that never makes it to the airing. Travel channel should consider adding that additional footage.
1,noise reducing headphones,Headphones were not operating properly. No sound flow through right speaker
3,"Good for the price, Uncomfortable","As others have stated, the Sony MDR-NC6 works to ""reduce"" noise but are quite uncomfortable. While in Vienna, I lost this set and went with a $60 JVC model that I love when I returned to the states. Yes, the price is far more, but on a long haul like that, It is worth it."
2,Noise cancelling......next to useless,"I purchased this 1/2 priced inexpensive Noise Cancelling headphone on the strength of what I have read about other N-C units like the Bose. I found this model next to useless and I can't be bothered to send it back so I use it with my Roland KR 107 electronic piano instead with the power turned off. It certainly did not work satisfactorily with my portable CD nor cassette players. Noise reduction was next to zero, based on my expectations. Wind noise was amplified tremendously so many times I had to use the unit turned off while walking. Maybe some noises, some frequencies are reduced but I don't know which ones, certainly not road noises from passing cars. Anyone thinking of buying this unit....DON'T. I have another Sony headphone which I like a lot but this one's a ""lemon"".tony maighnath"
2,Headphone noise,Bought these headphones about 3 weeks ago and have found that I can only wear them for about 15-20 minutes max. The NR feature has a high pitch tone that drives me nuts when there is no music playing. When music is playing I can tolerate it for a little while. I have found that using the headphones with the NR feature off is a little more comfortable for me but the headphones do tend to push hard against your head getting very uncomfortable for long play listening. They do produce a nice sound if you can overlook these two things.
4,Headphones,"I rate the Sony Headphone as a 4.The performance is very good.Clarity was outstanding.The only reason I didn't give it a 5 was the headphone ear pads make your ears sweat,and the adjustment can be a little more easier to adjust."
2,Work well on airplanes but...,"These headphones made a huge difference when I tried them on airplanes. That must be what they're specifically designed for. Even without music playing, you can no longer hear the plane's engine with the headphones switched on. I closed my eyes and even missed the flight attendants' offering me a drink!They performed less well on buses and trains: they made a slight difference on a noisy subway. The sound quality is pretty good, not great. However, the volume from one of the ears was noticably louder than the volume from the other ear--I confirmed this with several friends. This got very annoying with certain songs. I suspect the pair I received was defective.They're not comfortable, not uncomfortable. My ears were a little sore after a few hours of wearing them, but it wasn't too bad."
2,Don't Lose your Money nor time!,"Sony in general has been disappointing in every field lately (don't know about Sony Television Channels). It is accessible, no doubt about it, but it has no consistency. It starts fairly well and after 1 hour of flight, it is clumsy, undistinguished sound. Definetely not worth. Fortunately it doesn't cost like a Bose, but it has nothing to do with a Bose. Ergonomics also is a failure. Battery life a question mark, you never know. It hurts the ears after a while. Worst of all, NO GOOD SOUND QUALITY. Even without ambience sound like air travel. Even sitting on a temple, without anyone around, sound does not convince. I do not recommend it at all, although it is low cost. Buy I would recommend it only if in an emergency. BUt remember, it won't last. Everyday it passes it gets worse. Very short useful life."
3,Meh...OUCH MY EARS,"These headphones have pretty good sound quality, and they are noise canceling... and they are pretty cheap, what's not to like?A LOT. For starters, these headphones have almost no padding whatsoever, and your ears will start to hurt in just a few minutes. second, What little padding it DOES have, wears off pretty easily. The headphones get much more comfortable if you put them on backwards(so the cups swivel to match your ear), but the cups are so heavy if you tilt your head forward they almost fall off. these headphones are just not meant for long duration listening, sound quality isn't the ONLY thing to look for in equipment you could be wearing for hours."
3,Started Out Good Then Failed,"I was very excited to have this product when it arrived. I travel a lot and needed a good noise cancelling headset for all the airplanes. It started off really good, and then the right ear speaker only worked on regular sound (not noise cancelling mode). Now both earpieces only work when it's not in the noise cancelling mode, not good. I would have had them replaced but it was after the warranty, go figure."
4,great for the price.,"For the amount you pay for these headphones they are worth it. I'm sure that ones in the 100.00 range would be better, but these work for those not wanting to break the budget. They have a switch on them that when flicked drowns out all the noise around you, its great. Perfect for airplanes!!"
1,Poor performance,"I did not hear any significant reduction in background noise when the circuit was activated. It was a similar noise background to regular headphones. I do not recommend this product for anybody expecting ""noise canceling"" because it does not do it."
4,Sony MDR-NC6 headphones,The earphones serve the purpose very nicely. I use them primarily to detect defects while transferring music from LPs to CDs.
3,Alright,"These work pretty well. Music and movies sound pretty clear. You can really tell the low audible range is being cancelled out. They work pretty well on the plane, and when I take them off I think the low drone of the plane is too loud and have to put them back on.These are not super comfortable though with glasses on. They really press hard on my ears and my ears get sore from the arms of my glasses. The picture looked as though it had that ring of padding around the speakers, but they don't, just the normal foam mesh that came on headphones in the 80's.Sometimes I feel like I still have to drown out some noise (on the intermittent and high end frequencies) to listen. This is something I shouldn't have to do with the full ear headphones. This is probably due to the missing extra padding around the edge to seal your ears in. If they had more padding, I would give 5 stars"
1,one word: terrible,"I did not buy it from Amazon but from a third party. Do not waste your money on this product. It was less than $30 so I decided to give it a try; wrong move... First off, the pads are very thin, after a short while, it starts hurting the ears. Ergonomically very uncomfortable. During the first few days noise cancelling was alright, somehow there started a humming each time when noise cancelling mode got activated; also uncomfortable in terms of sound quality. I simply would return it but was late..."
3,Average Noise Canceling Headphones,"I bought this headphones a mnth back. Here is my take on it:+sSound Quality is quite good.Some low intensity disturbances like CPU noises etc...get canceled quite well-sA lot medium and high intensity noises, disturbances which are not constant engines revving, conversation..etc..etc DON'T get filtered out, rather you'll notice that there is 20% raise in volume/bass to counter them!These headphones are a bit heavy, quite a lot of discomfort when you wear it more than 1hr at a stretch."
3,I was expecting better,"After reading reviews of this and just about every other NC headphone, and not wanting to spend $300 for Bose, I chose these. I was dissappointed. First, can't Sony and other electronics mfrs create a packaging system that won't tear up your hands just to get the product out? Second, there was absolutely no ambiant noise reduction at all if the NC was in ""off"" mode. In ""on"" mode, there was a fair amount of noise reduction, but also a very annoying white noise hiss. I'm taking a long flight from South Florida to Alaska and I want to block out as much cabin noise as possible, but also want musical clarity. Finally, the foam earpiece cover either came ripped or ripped right away. So back these went. I spent more and got the Jabra 820s instead and I love them!!"
3,Noise CANCELLING? FOLDING?,"I like the sound and they are comfortable. However, they do not really cancel much noise. I don't mind the hiss that creates the ""white noise"" that supposedly ""cancel""s extraneous noise, but they don't really cancel. They just kind of curtain off the noise. You still hear the outside noises. I haven't used them on a plane yet. That will tell the real story.As for whether they fold? Not really. The ear pieces swivel in so that the headphones are relatively flat, however, they are not at all compact by any stretch of the imagination. Note before you buy that they still take up about a 6 inch square by 2 inch thick space in your briefcase. Not compact at all."
2,"Good sound, but not durable","I travel internationally for my work and use NC headsets for long flights on a frequent basis. After I purchased the Sony phones (my 4th set of NC headphones), I was impressed with the sound quality and comfort. But, after about three months, I noticed that the headphones were becoming more and more loose on my head. Then, without any particular inciting event, the plastic head band simply broke apart. I could probably fix it with duct tape, but this seems ridiculous. So, if you are planning on heavy-use headphones, I would recommend that you continue looking..."
1,Not noise cancelling,"I usually trust Sony products but these did not cancel out noise. I found the bud style earphones are much better. And, since I opened them, they can't be returned. I don't recommend them."
2,Were just OK - not great - then they stopped working,"I got these to use on the train to work everyday so the fact that the sound was average was OK with me because noise canceling can only do so much. However, battery life was terrible and after 3 months of regular use, the noise canceling stopped working. They also are not comfortable for more than 1 hour at a time as the padding for these on the ear phones is thin."
1,Crap! I used to trust the Sony name,"I have the Bose headset, and got the Sony as a spare. The lower price would indicate that there is something lacking, and well there is! The Sony headphones are uncomfortable, resonant, and--well, I just don't use them.BTW, the noise reduction is much less than the more expensive Bose.Guess you get what you pay for sometime!"
2,"Comfortable, but poor noise cancellation",I fly a LOT for work and was looking for some good noise cancelling headphones without spending a fortune. I have a lot of Sony products so thought I would give these a try. These were comfortable to wear on long flights but the noise cancelling was really poor. I returned these and instead have the sennheiser PXC250. I've only had them a short time but they seem pretty good.
2,Didn't work,"These may have been defective, I'm not sure, but they didn't do the job. I tried to contact the seller twice for a refund and never received a response. Amazon did refund my money however."
2,Bad for commuting,I bought these headphones because I broke the earbuds that came with my iPod. These headphones are uncomfortable to wear and the sound quality is at best the same as the earbuds that came with my iPod. They are not a good value for the price. My advice would be to stick with the earbuds.
3,"Ok for the price, but not great headphones.","It really depends on what you want to do with these headphones. If you want to hook them up to your walkman or your laptop, then they will be fine for that purpose. If you plug them into a home stereo receiver, they will not sound good. The noise cancelling feature really doesn't work, I turn it on, and all it does is add noticable hiss to the sound. It annoyed me so bad, I shut if off. The headphones also take a AAA battery for powering the noise cancelling function, and I wouldn't even bother putting one in, it really doesn't work well. So, i'm kinda so so with these headphones. I own a set of sony studio type headphones, and you can really tell the difference between the over 100dollar headphones and the 25dollar headphones. But i'll still take these with me on the plane, they come with adapters for airplane music, and a nice case for the headphones."
3,There's a noise trade off here...,"I bought these as a mid-priced experiment to see if they would be able to reduce background noise from air-conditioners, computers, etc. They actually do a good job of that. However, they have a rather loud hiss when active, so the low-frequency noise that gets cancelled is replaced by a high frequency hiss that is almost as bad. I'm not sure if it's worth the trade-off. Higher-end units would likely have quieter circuitry and less self-noise. You get what you pay for!"
4,Good Quality,"These headphones are pretty good quality. The noise canceling does not cancel out all the noise, but it cancels enough for the price. But sometimes when it is windy you can hear out of rustling noise. Also the bass is pretty solid."
2,Useless for Noise Canceling,These headphones sound OK without any noise canceling but the noise canceling adds so much white noise that it is often louder then the noise they cut out. What good is that? Pretty much useless and in the noise canceling department but OK as just normal headphones.
2,"Doesn't cancel noise, just changes it","Cheap noise-canceling earphones like this seem to simply change the nature of the noise. A loud AC is the perfect noise for noise canceling technology since it is so invariant. These earphones simply change the nature of the sound while giving your ear the impression of being buffeted. I would recommend getting something else.The bass is a little weak, but on the whole the music reproduction isn't bad, except for the uncomfortable feeling of listening to loud music without actually hearing loud music.Also, the battery compartment presses up against the top of my head which makes it doubly uncomfortable to wear.On the plus side, it comes in a nice little bag."
2,Not What You Would Expect From a Sony Product... :(,"Typically I love Sony products second only to BOSE but in this case I was greatly disappointed. The headphones are hard and uncomfortable to wear and the ""noise canceling""element....doesn't. I bought this for my 12 year old as his first ""real"" set of headphones and didn't want to spend a great deal of money on them since they were for a 12 year old. This was a mid level set and while I did not expect them to be BOSE like I sure expected more than this from Sony. Oh well!"
3,"Pronounced hiss, noticeable noise reduction","These headphones do a great job of suppressing low frequency noise, like the sound of your computer fans and hard drives and office ventilation, and are really good for airplane noise. There is a pronounced hiss that becomes less noticeable at moderate volumes. They are large, and I wish they had cups around the ears to further damp all sound, instead of the flat pads they have. They don't exactly fold - the earpieces twist 90 degrees to lie flat on the plane of the over-the head band, but are still 6x7x1.25 inches. Any blowing air will make wind-on-microphone noise. They were very good on the plane. The airplane plug adapter may be handy. A behind the head style band would be better."
2,Poor quality product,"Very disappointed with these headphones. After 1 week of using with my ipod, the right side stopped working. I returned to Amazon and they graciously gave me another product (expedited). The noise canceling was not very good but I lived with it. Now after a few more months, it is again not working properly...for songs, you can no longer hear lead vocals, just the instrumentation and background vocals. For audio books, there is no sound at all. It's weird and I'm baffled. Don't think it's user error, as there are no settings on the headsets. Even cheapy headphones that I've had for years still work. I used these for running so maybe they were not meant for that?!"
4,Deserved the number 3 spot!!!!,While I was looking at head phone reviews I noticed that several cites rated these headphones in the top 3 along with Bose and Audio-Technica well for the price these deserve the number 3 spot. Comfortable to wear and light weight these headphones are worth every cent. Given headphones wear out (especially around the ears) I believe you cant go wrong with these. While traveling from hotel room to hotel room they sure help keep the noise down especially when your room is by the elevators. The audio sound is good for capturing the highs and the lows. Overall I believe these will serve you well in canceling 80% of the noise around you.A great value for the price and performance is well above average.
4,Too tight on my ears,"Sound is good; suspect the Noise Canceling works, but with most small headphones, there is No adjustment to the head to make it comfortable around my ears, which means that what I really need are those Big, soft, gentle Sony headphones."
3,"Good at first, but after a year,...no longer working right.","I bought these on 07/01/2005. Today (07/04/2006), the right side no longer works. They were fantastic during the period in which they were working though."
2,White noise,"I tried once the Bose headphones and was expecting something similar from Sony. Unfortunately the headphones leave an annoying white noise in noise-cancellation mode. They are inexpensive, true, but I don't think they're worth it."
1,another poor Sony product,I bought the N6 in Nov of 2008. They went on a few airplane rides and now they don't work. They didn't reduce the noise level very much. Its white noise that it produces is way too much background noise. It hardly canceled any noise on an airplane. They are still in warranty but get this. Sony said its a 24$ exchange fee. So you pay shipping to get it there. I paid 30$ to buy them . Forget this unit and pay more and get more. Like something that actually WORKS.
3,Decent Phones,"These are fairly decent headphones that do a reasonable job of reducing noise. They are worth the money, but I find myself wishing I would have bit the bullet and went for a more expensive pair. If this is all you can afford you will do well with them, if you can spend more, do it. They are comfortable and can be worn for hours, without a problem. I would rate the noise reduction about a six on a scale of one to ten (ten being best). The quality of the sound reproduction is fine, probably about seven and a half on the same scale. There is a ""sweet spot"" placement area on each ear where the cancellation works best and this is kind of a pain to find sometimes. Incidentally, don't cup your hands around the ears while the canceling is turned on... wicked squeal.In summation: audio reproduction - 7.5, noise canceling - 6, comfort - 8, and convenience 7."
4,"good, but not good enough...","i have recently bought these sony headphones with high hopes in mind, which weren't quite satisfied. i like these headphones, and the noise cancelling works surprisingly well, there just isn't enough bass to satisfy my needs. i'm not complaining though, for i didn't pay the $60 and i strongly recommend you don't, but for $35 i say go for it"
3,MDR-NC6 Headphones Schmedphones,"The headphones were purchased for use at my place of work (a cubicle farm) to help me ignore the ""noise"" from a loud co-worker. I find the noise canceling feature works somewhat but not well enough. The foam earcups allow too much external noise to seep in. Too, the resultant noise canceled audio has less fidelity when enabled so I now leave the noise canceling feature turned off. A good pair of ""ear buds"" would be better at reducing external noise.One annoying feature is the excessive pressure the headphones place on my ears. They are uncomfortable to wear for long periods. There is no adjustment to reduce the ""clamping force"".The sound quality is rich and full when the noise canceling feature is disabled. They are worth the $30 I paid for them."
3,Not bad for what they cost,"I found that the headphones cancel most noise but do not meet all that Sony claims they do. I often listen to CD's while my wife watches TV and they do what I expected for the price. Rating them as a Noise-Canceling Headphone, do not compare to Bose or other expensive headphones, so if you are looking for perfection then spend the money."
3,Not bad for a relatively cheap replacement,"I travel a lot and usually pass the time on an airplane reading and listening to music on my I-pod. After my last pair of headphones were stolen, I needed to buy new ones. I didn't want to spend the money that I had previously spent on a pair Sennheiser headphones, so I opted for these as a cheaper replacement. They are actually quite comfortable and I didn't have any problems wearing them for the entire 4 hour flights to and from home. They don't knock out the noise like the higher end noise cancelling phones do, but they work in a pinch, and like I said they are pretty comfortable. I'd give them a higher rating, but they're just not Sennheiser or Bose quality."
3,I returned this product,I can't really comment on any of the attributes as I returned this product without opening as my needs changed.
1,Calling it a Noise Canceling Headphone a big joke,"Have been using it for past month plus, but the same by no means can be called as a noise cancelling headphone. I purchsed relying on the name - SONY, but this product has not lived upto the standards of the company. The 1 star rating is for headphone working properly as a normal headphone. When wearing the headphone and switching on the noise canceling and listening songs from my Sandisk MP3 player, even the keyboard strokes of my laptop I was using could be heard so easily. I felt I would have purchased a better product at 30$ - normal headphones..."
1,Would Sony recall this crap?,"I couldn't believe how this product passed the Sony's quality test. Claiming 70% noise cancellation should be a typo error. 7% may be???I guess I found how it cancels the noise. The hissing noise that generates when power on and the ear cover does the job. Don't even give a try, you will regret it."
2,Not Worth It,The headphones seem not to do any true noise cancelling. It just increases the volume when you turn them on. There is also a pronounced hissing sound the entire time they are on. They are also uncomfortable. They are heavy and press on the ears to the point that I cannot wear them.
3,"Work great for airplanes and refridgerators, useless for cafes.","According to Wikipedia's article on noise cancelling headphones, ""retail noise cancelling headphones only cancel continuous low frequency sounds like the hum of a refridgerator or airplane engine but are rather ineffective against speech or other rapidly changing audio signals."" That's the case with these. I was admittedly impressed when I stood next to my fridge and flipped the switch. However, the refridgerator never bothered me. I bought these because I thought they'd let me study in a cafe or cancel out the sound of a TV. They don't. They're no more effective at cancelling those noises than my regular headphones. Also, they are a little uncomfortable (my ears ache after a few hours) and the hiss that other reviewers have mentioned is annoying (though you don't notice it after a few minutes)."
1,hissing noise and not comfortable,"A few years ago, I tried on a pair of expensive Bose noise canceling headphones and they were great. Recently, I decided to buy a pair of noise canceling headphones, but I was cheap and bought these. They're actually noisier than the normal sounds I'd be hearing if I had them turned off. I'm wearing them at work right now and I could write a transcript of the conversation I'm overhearing in the next cube. Also, they're not comfortable and they're definitely messing up my hair."
1,White Noise Hiss does not equal noise cancelling,The noise cancelling feature of these headphones appear to be wrapped up in the white noise hiss that accompanies the audio. No apparent noise reduction is present. I bought them at Bestbuy and they are going back tonight.
1,two words: outdated and elementary,"This book is very basic and is well outdated by at least 3-4 years. no mention of dvd or dts!! according to the author thx is the breaking revolution??? I purchased the book in hopes of finding a few tips on the design and building of an actual home theater ($15,000 - $25,000). what i got was a boring explanation of dolby pro logic and stereo sound. if you are designing a $1500 system with a $300 dolby surround sound receiver this is the book for you!!!!if not keep looking!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Very Basic - Disappointing,Disappointed that there was only 1-2 pages on Front projector Theaters and 1-2 pages on rear projection theaters.
2,It's History and Not Up To Date,"The book is well written and the material covered logically organized. However, advances in technology makes this more of a history text than the current ""how-to"" book that I was looking for. You would never buy this book in a store because you would flip through a few pages and find out that Wolenik talks about DVD in the ""future tense"". I would buy an updated version -- even for a rank beginner this one is not worth much. OK pictures!"
4,great music at a great price!,"Many years ago... I bought and enjoyed the album ""Urubamba"". Some years later, I bought this album to satisfy my craving for more Andean flute music. I was initially a little disappointed; the production quality is not up to the level set by Urubamba and the style is less ""polished and refined"". But it grew on me.In recent years, I began searching again for more such music, and found the groups Inkuyo and Sukay. And here on Amazon, I came across this CD (my album is long gone)... as soon as I heard the first track sample, it all came back, and I realized I now like this CD as much as the ""polished and refined"" sound of Urubamba (not that I wouldn't buy an Urubamba CD in a heartbeat, but I can't find it anywhere!). Yes, this CD is less polished, but it maintains a high energy level and has equally good musicianship, with a style that is more spontaneous and carefree (IMHO). At this price I think this is an excellent buy, and I recommend it highly."
2,jackfrost 11787,"I am actually a professional in the field AND/OR an engineering student. Or perhaps I am the author of this book reviewing myself. Either way, this is an average book on Mastercam. Better than some, but not nearly in-depth enough for its' size and price.Try Mastercam tutorials and handbooks available directly from Mastercam or their dealers. Far better illustrations and explanations."
2,Missed Parody,It was maybe just me and I missed the humor. I loved who moved my cheese. I n who cut my cheese I the parody was not very good and it was not very funny as some other reviews indicated.
4,review,its a very good read. anyone who sicks a major change from their comfort zone should definately get a copy
3,Tasty as a slice of Swiss and just as thin,"This book is as almost as helpful as the one it's poking fun at. I wasn't a big fan of ""Who Moved the Cheese"" and I don't know why it's so popular, but this parody contains some outstanding practical advice, most of it centering around why its best to avoid people who eat lots of dairy products and then have adverse gastrointestinal reactions to it.I made the mistake of reading this book in a crowded bookstore and a couple of times I broke out in serious giggles, which got me some strange looks from the other patrons who probably thought I was reading the serious book and not the parody. But I ignored them and finished the whole book in about 15 minutes. And that's a big problem with this thin little tome-- you can easily knock it off during a lunch break. Why anyone would want to buy it is a bit of a mystery. Then again, why anyone would spend [their money] on ""Who Moved My Cheese"" is a mystery as well."
4,Good product !,"Good solid headphones for the price !! The sound is better than the last pair of in-helmet headphones I purchased last year. Of course you won't get the super HiFi surround sound sound that you would with Bose type headphones. But, I was impressed with the loudness and, ability to be able to still hear my ipod tunes while riding down the freeway at high speeds, without it being drowned out by the wind rushing through my helmet. I really like the coiled cable and and quick-detach connector that is built into the cable.A SOLID product !!"
5,"Distinguished refinement, kaleidoscopic nuances!","Sholomo Mintz has proved over the years, his astounding technique, fingering, tune and temperament have always been for him a special trademark. And so - as expected result - his sound is organic, expressively sincere and deeply engaging.If I would have to pronounce myself by the four best sets of Paganini's caprices,I would chose these ones: Michael Rabin, Salvatore Accardo and Ruggiero Ricci.Don't miss it!"
5,Post it,"I keep a set of these on my desk so I can mark magazine articles, books, or correspondence. Makes going back for a reference easy and fast."
2,don't fit older holder,the new shapped dispensers don't fit the older holders - I was able to fix the problem by carving out some of the plastic inside the holders
2,Poor physical condition,"I purchased Cocktail Time (along with 5 or 6 othter titles, all produced by BBC Audiobooks) from Amazon. The packaging for each title is for ""library editions,"" which these may have been. Several of the discs in each title are so severly scratched that the otherwise impeccable preformance is full or skips, echoes and repeats. I do not fault Amazon -- who, prior to this has never sold me a faulty audiobook -- I fault BBC Audiobooks, who should never have sold copies so flawed."
3,The cop who is really just human.,Although the Swedish country side is beautiful is the country really in that much disrepair ? Are the people in Europe that hopeless and pagan ? So obedient to the religion of the State to be avowed to nothing but the law of politics ?
2,Caution!,"Please take much of this information with a grain of salt. The author did not have the authority of the Church on this book. Some of the quoted so called ""seers"" and/or ""visionaries"" are nothing more than frauds who deceived people in order to make money. I also question the motives of this author by following suit."
3,Epoch Evolution,Had seen the movie on TV and enjoyed it; decided I wanted a copy so that I could watch it when I wanted to.
4,Viewing Yourself,Reading this book is like looking at yourself in a funhouse mirror. At first you dont know why his view is so warped but as you start to connect the scenes and events with those of your own life you start to see yourself clearer.
3,Riidiculous move that I somehow enjoyed...,"I couldn't resist watching this for the awesome cast, knowing that if I hadn't heard of it with all the awesomely funny actors in it, it couldn't possibly be very good. And it wasn't. It was like an hour and a half SNL sketch that is funny because it's funny to see the actors doing the ridiculous things they are doing and wearing the ridiculous clothes, but not because the material is really very funny or has anything to do with real life moments. That said, there are some moments that are are legitimately very funny. And for me, it was worth it to rent for those moments, and also because I adore Amy Poehler and this may not have made me love her more, but it also didn't make me love her less."
5,Awesome music and song!!,I have been looking for this song since I first heard it on KROQ here in Los Angeles County. Loved it when I heard it and now I own all the mixes I know about. This CD is a must have in your collection!!
2,Great on review; terrible in introducing the target subject matter,"This book is simply ""okay."" It is formatted nicely and easy to look at. The first few chapters on the review of statistics is generally nice (and even led me to question the negative reviews from others until I progressed further).Mid-way through Chapter 6, just about when stationarity is introduced, the text becomes useless to anyone who is not familiar with the subject matter. Intuition is none-existent in the topics presented - to the extent that I was confused by the presentation of subjects that I was already strong with.I am told Gardner's book is an excellent book with deep intuition; I have ordered it and will read it with the possibility of returning to peebles after I have a much better idea of what's going on."
3,Not as enjoyable as his other books,I have to agree with the previous reviewer - this is a darker book than Shah's other books and it seems to have an angry tone to it where the others were more light-hearted and had funny spots. Shah seems to dislike almost everyone he comes into contact with on this trip and is obsessed (and not in a very nice way) about his goal. I would recommend the Calipher's House or the Sorcerer's Apprentice or the Search for King Solomon's Mines instead - this book was a letdown compared to those.
4,Another classic Sandra Brown,"I love Sandra Brown and Chill factor was no exception. Having grown up in the far North East, the epic storm in this book brought back memories of those winters. She totally nailed the scene. Okay, the man of the book was a little shady and definitely could have just explained himself from the beginning and cleared up the entire following story. But then where would all the fun be? True to Sandra Brown, it may not make sense to hide his motive, but it sure makes for some tense romantic scenes and a good dose of suspense."
3,JUST A LITTE FAR FETCHED FOR ME,I found that I enjoyed the side characters in this book better than the main characters. It was a Thriller and well written but I just did not find it belevable that a women who thought she was kiddnapped by a killer would also be falling in love and wanting to have sex with him.
1,"Forget the ""thriller"", it's a romance novel","I got this from our library as an audiobook, believing it was a thriller novel. It is not; I was stuck with only this to listen to on a trip, and probably swerved off the road several times yelling ""who cares!?! Get to the action, we don't care who has sixpack abs or what they did on ""that sunday they first met!"" Argh, this is a romance novel, plain and simple, with some semblance of a thriller intertwined, but it's buried in so much useless drivel (unless you like romance novels) that you're rooting for the bad guy, anything, just somebody do something...and no, I don't mean kiss him.Thank heaven it was a shorter trip than the book, so I don't have to finish it."
3,"Laurell K. Hamilton: The Lunatic Cafe (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter) [Paperback]??","I recently purchased the 3rd, 4th, and 5th series of Laurell K. Hamilton's Anita Blake series, ""Vampire Hunter"" from this store.I ordered, and received, all normal size paperbacks from the same amazon store...except for this particular book.It is billed as a Paperback, but it came to me as one of those oversized paperbacks, (Softcover) and now I have this huge book to stick in the middle of my paperback collection.Of course, it wont fit, its bigger than the rest, so its gonna look dumb.If the book is a larger paperback, or what they call a ""softcover"", it should be billed as a softcover so I know what Im getting.I have several more of this series I'm going to buy, and I guess I will have to, somehow, check and make sure a paperback, is a paperback, is a paperback......"
4,"enjoyable, but too dominated by romantic interest","With Anita Blake we can usually count on a lot of smart-mouthing, gutsy defiance of creatures that you'd think would tear her to pieces. It's enjoyable watching her win, and she's a definite fictional heroine to all of us who were undersized growing up.What I like a lot about this book is the depth that is given on some of the social structure of the creatures Anita deals with. Hamilton's come up with some very creative stuff in this regard. On the weak side, though, the plot is overdependent upon her love interest(s). I don't want to spoil anything, so that's all the detail I'll go into, but for me this detracted from the book.If you already like the series, you'll probably like this one more if you enjoy a strong romantic aspect, and less if you're more interested in the mystery/action angle."
1,Don't start this series you'll be sorry by book 5-6,"Don't waste your time with any more of these. They become an outlet for an embittered, sick woman. Read Faith Hunters ""Jane Yellow Rock"" series if you want a good vampire hunter series.This series starts out ok but believe me unless you are into sick sexual fantasy you will regret giving any of your support to this author. I thought they would get better. They got MUCH worse. It's more and more sick sexual fantasy the later you get into the series. Unfortunatley I read about 8 of them before I gave up skipping the perverted sex parts because at that point that was about all there was. This isn't good heroic fantasy. It's just sick."
1,1 star is pretty generous,"This is a banal text, poorly written in every regard. Though Hamilton may have a sense for action beats in her works (which she should at this point in her incredibly-long career), everything else is marred by her lack of skill at dialogue, description and knowing when to sit back and let the story work, rather than filling it with endless, meaningless ""witty"" quips from her narrator. The characters are stock and unlikeable, but only because they are completely devoid of originality.If her other works are anything like this one, then she will have a statue erected in her name in the literary hall of shame before it is all said and done."
2,Good but not great,"This book is still good entertaining fun, just as the rest of the Anita Blake series. And plenty of body count for those who keep count ;)However a key element in stories is for the reader to identify with the main charecter. In this book that means we have to see the new love interest 'Richard' in the same dreamy light that the main charecter Anita Blake does. The relationship is stressed enough in this book that there's no just ignoring it...I could not bring myself to follow along with Anita where Richard is concerned. Richard gets an enthusiastic thumbs down from me.The fact that it is so imensely frustrating should tell you that Hamilton know's how to write and hook the reader. But her main charecter lost me in this book. I gave some of her other books higher ratings.still a worthwhile read."
5,Whoa....,"""The Lunatic Cafe"" was one wild ride. I dont know how Ms. Hamilton does it, but I swear the woman is brilliant. I have never been this addicted to a book. I absolutely COULD NOT put this down. In fact, its been that way with every book in this series thus far. My only problem now is that I have to wait for the next one to arrive. Until then I shall be watching my mail impatiently for the next installment. GO out and buy these books..you wont be sorry!"
5,UNREAL,"If you look at all my reviews , many are quite long-winded. I always have alot to say on things most important in my life.But here I have only one word to comment on the music and the performance.UNREALthere thats my review. Sure I know that is not helpful in any way, and please give me a vote of ""NO"".I should mention that Berg did not complete the opera but left extensive notes so that Friedrich Cercha completed it. Boulez mentions that a scholar named adorono felt satified with Cercha's work, and Boulez agrees.but I'm not so sure. The first 2 cds are clearly from the hand of berg, from the opening of the 3rd cd, immediately I/you notice that there is a drastic change in compositional quality. Its the best Cercha could do, and its good work. Just not near on the level as Berg's completed first 2 cds of music.Paul"
5,Highly Recommended!!,"Great idea book! I have been scrapbooking for years and don't want to ""dig through"" instructional articles to be disappointed to find a small pictured idea. This book is exactly what it says, an idea book, with lots of pictures and no articles. I look forward to the next volume."
2,Bought on a lark,"I also heard the NPR piece about this band. I bought The Loon on a lark. While the song I heard on NPR sounded pretty cool, the CD doesn't bear repeated listening. I've been a fan of the Femmes and the Pixies since the 80s when I was in high school. I hear a lot of that here. But so what? There are a lot of bands that can imitate the Femmes and the Pixies. I don't know about Talking Heads. Anyway, not the worst thing I ever heard, but it's just not that impressive. Just another angsty pop band. The new American Artic Monkeys/Strokes."
2,Not nearly so good as her books,"The main contribution this autobiography makes is the illness the crippling pain that she has had to endure year after year and which doctors dismissed as hysterical. The way doctors were accustomed to treat women several decades ago; this brings it back! Her husband comes off as a bit of a cipher, and the history of their multiple houses and frequent moves seems to conceal more than it reveals. There may be a wish for privacy here--but she IS writing an autobiography after all. Stick to Mantel's wonderful novels about Thomas Cranmer!"
1,Don't waste your money,"I purchased this CD because it had a good mix of ""classic blues songs"" by some great artists. In 2 words, it's AWFUL.The sound quality is so bad on most songs that it reminds me of some old cassettes that were copied from the original master to tape without a remix, copied to cassette and then mass copied to other cassettes, i.e ""truck stop tapes"".If I could have given it no stars I would have."
1,"Good Card, Rotten Customer Service","The first card I received was bad so I sent it back to the manufacturer, after that it was a total nightmare with hours on the phone speaking with incompetent customer service reps. I would be typing a short novel here to explain the details. My advice; if your card is bad return it to Amazon and not the manufacturer. Also, you must have a 420 watt power supply for this card."
1,An Irish Night Before Christmas,"How sweet! Let's portray Santa as a drunken Irish fool who totally bumbles Christmas.It is derogatory, inflammatory and a total slam of insults to an entire culture of people. To portray the Irish as drunken bums and elvish creatures with no brains.As a full blood Irish, I take personal offense to the book and it's portrayal of subject matter. Maybe this author needs to take another look at the Irish Culture, and find out what we are REALLY like. She might just get a wee bit of a shock."
5,Top Notch,"Wow! I was extremely impressed with The Tim Noonan DVD Boxed Set, and would recommend it to anyone wanting to learn quality magic. In my opinion, this is top notch magic taught by a real pro. Previously guarded secrets are now mine!"
5,The MOST important opera recording of the 80' s,"When the Pesaro Rossini Foundation announced that Il Viaggio a Reims had been reconstructed, we all knew that it was one of the most important cultural events of the century, and boy, we were not disappointed. This marvelous coronation opera is a gem! This first recording has all the excitement of those unforgettable Pesaro nights, with a 24 carat roaster of singers headed by the exquisite Texas soprano Lella Cuberli, whose hat aria covers her with glory. Everyone else is sensational, and Claudio Abbado shows why he is the finest living conductor."
3,Suunto M3 Windsurfing Watch,It is a good watch for windsurfing.Its only problem is a very poor instruction manual
3,Muito Bom,"O Produto é muito bom e atende bem as minhas expectativas, porém fica uma única e importantissima ressalva:- O relogio no tem bussola e o recurso de auxilio a largadas precisa ser ferido de acordo com o posicionamento que a bussola dá, ento, desta forma, o recurso em questo torna-se ineficiente sem uma bussola."
2,Saltbomb,"All hoisin sauces tend to be very salty, but this LKK one tips the scales with 1120mg of sodium per 2 tablespoons, which comes out to 28% of your recommended daily intake. This sauce gave me that sodium-burn sensation on my tongue. I'm going to look for another brand."
4,Jim White's South,"This is not a documentary about the South. This is a movie with a concept, an idea about the south, the Flannery O'Connor, murder ballads, pentecostal south alternative-country singer Jim White wants us to see. As a movie, it's an excellent one with an wonderful alternative-country soundtrack. The only problem with this movie is the preaching-teaching side of Jim White. He wants us to see the poor, white, weird, ultra-religious, devil fighs God South he defined as being the South. While he's worried on showing us the gotic side of dixie, he repeats himself dozens of times. The blue highway he stops is spiritual, the mountains are spiritual, small towns are divided in a line between God and Devil and that's it. Could'nt he show us his South and let us make our own interpretation of what we'seen?"
3,Dedicated to Harry Crews and Larry Brown,"If you want to watch an artsy Yankee with a European motif trying to pull himself off as a Southerner, then this is the film for you. No doubt, Floridian writers are all the time walking down country roads talking into car windows and electric guitar players are performing in the middle of a junk yard to an audience of one.Why would you focus on Staten Island born David Johansen aka Buster Poindexter aka The New York Dolls frontman as an example of southern music?The Chevrolet, which figures prominently in the film, sure sound like a Mopar when it starts up. Was that just a shout out to the Dukes of Hazzard or did you just think folks from the south ""is too dumb to notice""?Speaking of the south, the film seems to take place mostly in Appalachia, not the deep south you are led to believe. Of cource a chap from the BBC probably doesn't know the difference nor does a Californian or a New Yorker, which are the main players/producers.All in all I liked it."
4,"""Brief, But Pure Bliss""","In my humble opinion, X Marks the Pedwalk are one of the greatest, most ingenius bands of the electronic genre. Once considered, goth/industrial, they have progressed into a techno-pop/avante gaurde hybrid. Die hard industrial fans may not appreciate what they have evolved into, but they have trancended the rigid, stagnating cliches of industrial and have skyrocketed into the realm of intellectual and emotional artistic divinity. Not all of their songs are masterpieces on this album. I wish there were more songs on Drawback. But the few actual songs that are on Drawback had me playing the album for months. Sevren's voice has a razor sharp tenor. The synths are beautifully textured and layered with a velvet polish. The beats are complex and refined. The melodies create a stiring since of awe and bittersweet wonderment. A strong recommendation for anyone, who enjoys refined, intellectual, and original music that touches the soul. James Cowart"
2,A Disappointment,"I really wanted to love this memoir. I had heard so much about it and being from that area, felt that I would have an inside track to Karr's psyche. However, I found the writing style to be tedious and due to the darkness of the story, I was more than able to put the book away for a rest.There's no doubt that Karr's descriptive writing is excellent, it just didn't reel me in as I hoped. I also wondered why she used a fictitious name for the town she grew up in? All the surrounding areas kept their names and caused me confusion in the beginning of where is this action all taking place anyway? Apparently, the used book I received from Amazon from another reader felt the same. I found it odd with notations in the corners and grammatical corrections throughout with endless questions of ""what's the point here?"" scrawled in between text type.My hat's off to Ms. Karr for surviving such a childhood."
5,"hilarious, sad, poignant","this book remind me of ""daisy fay"" books. however, this story was pure non-fiction which stabs at your heart the author lived a tough life with a clinacaly insane mother, sickly and grouchy wooden legged granny, adult-minded sister, hard working simpleton dad. from the cancer-ridden oil fields of swampy texas gulf coast, to the beauty of colorado that couldnt hide the strangeness of her family.....this book is a must read for anyone who wants to realise their family or life isnt the only strange one out there. also if you like to people watch, this book has great character development. the authors approach to a sometimes tough life is overlayed with a quiet humor that makes you laugh. at the end, you love her crazy family as much as she does and you see the family ties thayt bond us, while unwanted at some times, are what makes us who we are."
1,Can't. Get Thru It,"I love memoirs, but no matter how hard I try, I can't even read half of this book.The book starts out with a chapter about some event that is portrayed as highly mysterious.Next, unfortunately, there are a lot of relatively boring chapters that do not solve this mystery.Other reviewers say the big mystery is solved towards the END of the book, but the middle simply could not keep my interest.This is only my opinion.Good luck."
5,I'm hooked!,"My cousin lent me this book during my recent visit to New York City. At the time, I was not familiar with Karr's work. I could not put this book down! Even after an exhausting day of Manhattan sightseeing, I'd look forward to reading this book... and would do so until 2:30 every morning!I found this book disturbing yet somehow so touching, sad, and beautiful that I would find myself crying. Karr writes about her tragic childhood in a seemingly detached manner, like the time she was raped by the neighborhood boy, molested by her babysitter, or the many times she witnessed her mother's psychological freak-outs.Her writing is eloquent; her childhood fascinating in a grisly ""American Beauty"" way. I'm now looking forward to reading ""Cherry"", a memoir of her teenage years. I'd recommend this book to anyone who values excellent writing and good humor. A strong stomach is a must!"
2,"flat, monotonous, self-justifying","I believe the reason the tone of this book is so flat is that Karr is much more interested in remembering her childhood the way she needs to remember it, rather than the way it really happened. Anyway, it rings false for me. Virtually none of the brightness and magic that shines so sweetly in childhood is present here.The great appeal of this book is, as I'm sure many have noted before me, schadenfreude, i.e., enjoyment obtained from the troubles of others. The appeal is further compounded by the novelty of the contrast between the book's dreariness and all the sugar coated pap everyone gets fed to them by Hollywood and TV. But that's just my guess. And although I enjoy a good pratfall as much as the next guy, I'm not ghoulish enough to enjoy wading through 300 pages of it. As for TV and Hollywood, people would find more nourishment for their souls all around them if they would just turn their backs on the entertainment industry. Thanks for listening."
1,subject matter is just too disturbing,If you are a fan of child rape then this is the book for you. Otherwise you may want to try something a little lighter. Briged Jones Diary is good for a few laughs. Anything by Terry Pratchett is amusing.
4,Body and soul -- Christian and black history,"This is a book that challenges your thinking and theology! Starting from the traditional creeds of the Christian church, and the creedal emphasis of the full humanity of Jesus at the same time that He was fully divine, it goes beyond the Platonic idea of ""spirits"" and ""shadows"" to emphasize the importance of how we treat the human body. It creates parallels between the Crucifixion of Jesus and lynching of blacks in their violation of the body (the sanctity of which is affirmed by Jesus' incarnation), the use of trees, the religious justification used by many for the violation of the body.While the first part of book seems a bit heavy and academic, it does establish a new way of looking at matters of faith and analyzing what we believe about the nature of Jesus, the nature of man, and the actions that our beliefs call for us to espouse or renounce."
5,Thank Heavens for Foyle,"Perhaps age has dulled me or perhaps it's the appalling lack of intelligent programing on television. In any case, I search out dramas or mysteries, such as this series, that hold my attention with wonderfully written and acted stories blending history and drama in fine detail. The characterizations are suberb and always leave you wanting more. I am grateful to learn that there will be more of Foyle - it would be so disappointing to leave the series at the end of the 4th set. I really hope that the British continue their fine productions in this genre. If you are looking for a present for a baby boomer or boomer+ - look no further than this series - there are few as good and none finer!"
5,Excellent series,"This is an excellent series. The stories are good, and there is subtle political commentary. Even in 1940's England, politics often superseded justice. Michael Kitchen and the rest of the cast do a superb job of presenting each story. The sets and costumes make it seem like '40's England."
2,Breakin' 2 Electric Boogaloo- Get Breakin(First one) it's better.,"Breakin'2 electric boogaloo, is pretty disappointing and cheesier than the first one which is better, this one again features more ballet/broadway/artsy stuff that does not fit in(like in the first)other than the same protagonists and bad acting and a bunch of kids, and Ozone/Turbo Being corny. Some really cool moves. I would stay with Breakin'."
4,A Wonderful Sixth,"Out of all the Beethoven's 6th symphony's recordings, this one is the best. Karajan with the Berlin Phil is definitely the best when it comes on Beethoven's sixth. (For the Eroica Symphony, I like Solti's the best, and for the fifth and ninth symphony, I like Bernstein's performance the best.)Too bad it's not pure digital stereo, you know, the ones made during the late seventies and beyond. If it is, this could have been even better. If you just want Beethoven's sixth, regardless of who the conductor is, or the ensemble, or the recording company, this is definitely a CD to buy. You would like some overtures too."
3,lah dee dah,Genesis Orridge's presence is certainly felt on this cd. Cevin is inventive but since Dwayne passed... that synergy / energy aint there anymore. This one is good after a nice 4:20 session. The jamaican samples make me wish he'd do an all Dub/Reggae kind of cd sometime. Or maybe collaborate with Ryan Moore of Twilight Circus fame.
4,big gundam,I bought this for my 10-year old son and the following are his comments:My mom purchased this for me for Christmas. This is my first perfect grade Gundam. It's really fun to build and it looks really cool but I don't know how to make the eyes light up since I don't know how to read Japanese. The hydraulics and the inner frame are really awesome. The hydraulics are a nice shiny chrome color. It is very detailed. It assembles to about about 14 inches. It was hard to assemble the fingers and put inside the palm. It's cool that there are these openings to show some of the inside armor. Overall it's really awesome!!!
4,Sister Loved Them,"I did not know when I bought them, but someone had stolen a pair she owned off her desk at work several jobs ago. These had the Yin and Yang which were far nicer than the ones that were taken and a favorite design of hers. I got them for her to help after her carple tunnel surgery. They were a hit."
3,Very Average Grill Thermometer,"I've had this thermometer for a while now and rarely use it. Not because I don't need it, but like others have mentioned the glass on it becomes very dark on the inside from what I believe to be smoke. Also it seems very slow to register the temp for whatever reason. For $10 I guess I shouldn't have such high expectations!"
2,Not as engaging as I would have thought,"The book has a great premise, but the writing manages to ruin it. I wish LaMonte, who is a great agent, would have gotten a good writer to tell his and his clients' stories."
5,Great kids book,This is a great kids book. A wonderful storytime book. The illustrations are especially well done. Reminds me of a Disney story.
5,Mercy Said No has really touched me deeply!,"When I first heard ""Mercy Said No"" it filled my heart and I have been inspired by this song ever since. It is this song that has inspired me to learn to sing and to take voice lessons. I need to find the Sheet Music to this song and I have not been successful yet. If anyone knows where I can find it I would greatly appreciate it! Contact me at: Straini007@aol.com"
3,"Good in the beginning, gets a little old by the end","This book was written shortly after the events described by the title. That being said, the writers were going for the sensationalism of the time to try to sell as many copies as they could. Though it was sensational in nature, it was fun to go along with the ride that the participants went through at the time."
2,Ramtha: The White Book,"A most comprehensive guide for those seeking spiritual enlightenment. Well presented, it holds your interest to the last page. You will read it again and again."
2,Boring,"An American friend gave me this CD thinking I would like it because I like new-age Celtic styled music. I can't bring myself to tell him what I really think! I just told him ""not bad, but not really my style"". In truth it was so terrible my wife and I were laughing. After the initial humor wore off it was just boring. Kind of like waiting in the office for the doctor: it is not very fun and when it is over you don't want to go back."
1,stay far far away,"Have used this charger for A year to charge my boat batteries. Never completes A cycle without having to un-plug and restart. Charged battery overnite, and found battery was boiling. Had to replace. Bought new model(walmart) and returned old in same box, and still having same problems.My life depends on dependable power offshore. This charger is garbage, going to sell at fleamarket and get real operational charger."
4,Perfectly Petite Pink Piano,"I purchased this item for my goddaughter's 2nd birthday, and it was a hit with her and her family alike! Adorably realistic and beautiful crafted - a fantastic gift for years to come. I highly recommend this for any child who loves music and parents who wouldn't mind an elegant toy to display around the house!"
5,Gorgous little girls piano,I bought this for my daughter when she was one an she is now three an still loves it and all her cousins do too. It is very durable for sure because I have caught a few little girls standing on top of it also. Ughhhh. But overall I plan for it to be a piece that we keep an she gives to her children.
3,Not my favorite,"The scenery was great, the acting was good. Alex O'Loughlin is awesome. I didn't care for the storyline. Sex scene was pretty graphic. I didn't care for that."
2,Oyster Farmer,"I like Alex O'Loughlin, but found this movie to be pretty slow moving without much excitement. It was a ""one time"" watch movie."
1,poor customer service,"I received this book in poor condition despite the listing as ""excellent"" The front cover was not attached and several pages were written on. I wrote the seller who did not respond to my request to exchange or receive a credit. Needless to say I would not recommend buying products from this seller."
5,Finnley's 6 yr. old review,"i liked it because it was funny and i liked it because it was spooky, but i wasn't scared. its in a big thing, a very shiny tray, the brain lays there. charles got caught. meg relized that it didn't have love.if your 16 then you can read it alone. if you're 6 then read it with your mom or dad.its a long book with really long chapters so it'll take quite a while. maybe read some chapters during the day"
4,A Wrinkle in Time,"Join Meg, her brother Charles, and her new friend Calvin on a wacky, "" wubulous"", adventure to the exotic planets of Uriel, Camazotz, and Ixchel. Meet the powerful IT and the sincere beasts. Each of them adds an interesting part to the evolving story. Mrs. Whatsit, Mrs. Who, and Mrs. Which teach moving lessons of friendship, peace, and love. Along with these lessons are the unbelievable scientific methods. As one anxiously reads "" A Wrinkle in Time"", emotions of sadness and joy will arise. "" A Wrinkle in Time"" is an extraordinary book for one who enjoys adventure in the unknown universe and a creative plot with love and mystery. The first of Madeleine L'Engle's time books is thoroughly enjoyable."
5,Cool Book!,"The book A Wrinkle in Time is a really cool science fiction book! The characters were pretty cool. My favorites were Mrs. Whatsit and Aunt Beast. The only thing about it I didn't like was the beginning because it was just drop dead boring! I think you should not just stop after the first few pages though. I would recommend it to a third grader, like myself, who likes to just sit and read."
3,An original combination of Sci-Fi and Fantasy,"This book by L'Engle was refreshingly original in the fantasy or sci-fi genre, but was also very confusing. This book is not for young readers, as much of it is too confusing for them to understand. The book lacks action when compared to most other fantasy/sci-fi books"
4,Good book,"I enjoyed it. That is why I give it a 4 rating. It wasn't my absolutely favorite book in the world, though.So no 5."
3,A wrikle in time,"A Wrinkle in Time, a story of a young girl named Meg, her brother, and a good friend destined to stop evil from comming over the world. This book teaches a great lesson. That lesson is that family is very importaint and nomatter what happens you should never stop loving your family and be greatfull for all the good things that you have in your life. love is the one thing that can solve your problems. And there nothing in the world better than to have someone love you for who you are. life is a big mystery, but it is a wonderfull thing that should be used to the fullest and should be used wisely."
3,A Wrinkle In Time,A Wrinkle in Time is an interesting book. It's about a girlthat wants to find her father and has to tesser(tessering is where someone time & space travels)from planet to planet.I gave this book 3 stars because it didnt make me want to keep reading for the first half of the book.If you listen to my point of view I say go ahead and read the book if you're into books where the book leads you on and after the first 5 chapters.So once you've read my review go and find the book and start reading the series of these books. I think you'll really enjoy them if you're into that sort of thing.Have fun and enjoy.
3,"Sci-Fi isn't my thing, but it might be yours!","A Wrinkle In Time was a story with confusing concepts, unusual settings, but an interesting story line. Personally, I found Madeline L'Engle concepts unrealistic and it wasn't a book that I usually pick off the shelf, but the writing was descriptive with an interesting choice of events. L'Engle wrote a story with characters and happenings that were over the edge, which I did not enjoy. I found that the story was beautifully written and the events were different, yet imaginative, but I felt it had no substance or meaning to me as a person today. Madeline chose characters with specials powers, and creatures that were unreal. In this story, there are different dimensions, which made me confused, as they traveled from one dimension to another on a quest for her father and then her brother. This book was a page-turner, but was not something that related to me."
5,A Wrinkle in Time,"My granddaughter received this book from me as a gift.She is 14 years old; very good reader. She said the bookwas excellent; and the author is very good, and famous.My Granddaughter was pleased to read this author'swork, ""A Wrinkle in Time"". Wonderful story, and a goodold-fashioned good morals.She highly recommends it - and so do I.She said it was very descriptive; but easy reading; and she could notput the book down....."
2,"Misleading and sugary- why a ""classic?""","When I first read this book in 5th grade, I loved its blend of everyday teenage feelings and fantastical science fiction. Its brief discussions of time and space made me feel intelligent and ""grown-up."" Now as a sophomore in high school, I realize how misleading much of its content is... it merely dabbles in elementary time/space concepts- a dangerous thing to attempt- and even gives inaccurate information, much of which young readers may take for granted. For example it says that Time is the 4th dimension, which is untrue. The only redeeming quality of this book is that it has entertaining events and characters. However it contains the most oversimplified, poorly researched view of the universe I have ever seen!"
5,Wow.,"This book was absolutely amazing. It kept me interested until the very end. I cannot believe the imagination of Madeleine L'Engle. I would never have been able to dream up this idea in a million years. The characters seemed so real, as though they actually exist, but at the same time, you can never imagine these events happening. Ms. L'Engle, if you ever read this, I'm begging you to write more books, especially about Vicki Austin and her gift of kything.(By the way, if you haven't read ahead into the series, Meg and Calvin get married and have seven kids. It's very interesting, don't you think?)"
1,inexplicable classic,"I've tried to get through this book several times, because I have read widely in the genre, and because so many people seem to love it. On each occasion, I have found it tedious and been unable to compel myself to finish it. There are countless better books out there."
1,poor description of item,"We spent money on an item that we couldn't use. It was not clear that this was a radio play based on the book. Had we known that, we wouldn't have ordered."
3,A Wrinkle In Time,I would recommend this book to people who like fantasy books because it has magic and things that wouldn't happen in real life. It was easy to concentrate on the story because it was an interesting book. I don't connect to any of the characters or events because they were all too mystical. I enjoyed the genre because I like books that have a mystical type theme to them. None of the chapters ended with a cliffhanger like some of the books I've read but they had interesting ending. I don't that I would want to read another book by this author because if I made a list of books this would be on of the last ones on my list.
5,A love from 4th grade,"This book was read to me in school during 4th grade, and I've loved it ever since. The main characters are Meg Murray, Calvin O'Keefe, and Charles Wallace, Meg's little brother. The story is told mainly by Meg's point of view. She is the ""unlucky"" and ""stubborn"" girl who hates her looks and everything else about herself. She also has to look out for Charles Wallace, who is much smarter than he should be for a 4-year-old. But when they meet up with Mrs. Who, Mrs. Whatsit, and Mrs. Which, along with Calvin O'Keefe, they're sure to discover what happened to their missing father, and how to save our own planet from becoming surrounded by dark shadows. A wonderful adventure of space travel using the 5th dimension - a tesseract!"
3,"I enjoyed it, but found it severely lacking","I just took this book out from the library a few weeks ago. I enjoyed it so much I read it in a day and a half,also because it's due back today. After reading it though, I can see why it's a better book for Children. I'm in my 30s and this is the first time I've read it. As to not give away too much of the story for those who have not read it, I won't go into too much detail but I wish certain things were expanded and explained more. Mostly the ""black thing"" or shadow What happened with that? What happened to IT?? how long were they gone in terms of earth time?If I were younger I probably wouldn't question it and just take it for what it is. It's too bad I didn't know of this book when I was younger and had given it a better review from a child's point of view."
4,Good transaction,"I would buy again from this seller, as the transaction was prompt and the book was in good condition. The only thing that I was surprised by was the big name written on the top of the book in highlighter that hadn't been mentioned in the product description; my guess is that the description given was a generic one. My only criticism then would be to say that product description should be a bit more specific."
3,A really good book!,"I really liked this book. I read it when I was nine and didn't quiet understand it, but once my mom read it to me, it made a lot more sense! It's really mind- boggling to even think about a ninth demension and how you could get lost in it! GOOD BOOK!"
1,Plagiary,"This book is a clear version of plagiary. Two scenes come directly out of Have Spacesuit Will Travel, written ten years earlier by Robert Heinlein. Furthermore, her ""futuristic knowledge"" is stolen from Heinlein as well. I find it disturbing that she won an award for this book, when such a blatant plagiary exists. It surprises me she was never sued for this when one of her scenes is word for word out of Heinlein's book, and that it is actually forced into Wrinkle. Engle should be ashamed of herself. Bypass this book and read Have Spacesuit instead. It's a much better read by a better writer."
4,3 cheers for Mrs. Engle!!!,A Wrinkle in Time deifnitely ranks in my alltime favorite books list. The book was a joy to read. It was easy to tell the main message of the story which was that you should always stick together. This is shown many times in the story. I read this book last week and everytime I picked up the book I couldn't wait to read what happened. The only flaw in this book was the ending. It was very predictible and went by very fast. It was the climax of the story and I wish it was a little more descriptive and exciting. Overall don't let the ending get to you because it's not terrible I just think it could've been a little better. This is a must read book for anyone who wants to read an interesting book.
4,"slow start, great book","I give this adventure 4stars because at the beginning it was sortof boring.About maybe 20 pages in it got exciting. If you are a patient reader, I recomend this book."
2,A review 20 years in the making,"I tried to read this book while in grade school. But the book's vocabulary and concepts were too difficult to understand (even with a dictionary). Maybe I was dumb, who knows? Now twenty years later, I just finished reading this book from cover-to-cover. It's an interesting book, but the ending is SUPER-abrupt. I expected a show-down between the forces of good and evil. But the story literally came to a screeching halt with the usual ""love conquers all."" Well, I'm not saying that love is a bad thing, don't get me wrong. I just expected a much better ending."
2,Not as good as I remembered...,"I read this a few decades ago and thought it was great, if a bit pedantic. Now, after Harry Potter and reading the Narnia books, I see it as a book ahead of its time, but very pedantic. The writing style isn't compelling and the protagonist, Meg, is extremely annoying. I don't see that she is that sympathetic of a character. She has frequent bouts of temper, crying and yelling, and behaving in a way that my wife calls ""ugly."" She just isn't a character one feels naturally compelled to identify with. Our daughter, at 13, said that Meg sounds like ""a brat."" I have to agree. I like the way she's intelligent and very good in math and science - this is very appealing to me. But the character is just too annoying to want to read much about."
3,A grown-up book with a child-like cover,"I read this book when I was 15. By this age I had read all of Micheal Crichton's books and Anne Rice's books up until that point in time. I didnt think I would have any trouble reading a book intended for middle school students. I understood the story fairly well, but I after I finished the book I felt confused and realized I did not truly understand the underlying premise for the story. So I did what all 15 year olds do and forgot about it.However now that I am 22, I found that the meaning of the book become clearer to me. I have also found that I like the book a whole lot better than I did when I was younger. It was more interesting and compelling even though I already knew what was going to happen.This book is like the ""Chronicles of Narnia"": you have to read it again as an adult to understand what you miss out on during your first reading as a child. Thus you realize what this book is really saying and you develop a better appreciation for it."
5,Book in beautiful shape and shipped quickly.,"This book was a favorite of mine when I discovered it in our school library shortly after it was published in 1962. I shared it with my niece when she was in grade school, and she just asked me to get her a copy for her personal library for her 26th birthday next month."
2,A WRINKLE IN TIME,"We think this book is really not that good. The book is not really good for little kids because there are complicated words in it. We got confused on the book and it was hard to understand the meaning of it. We really did not enjoy this book. Some parts of the book were good and exciting, but other than that the book was kind of dull."
1,worst book ever,"This book was about some girl named Meg and her brother Charles. They went on an adventure. The thing is it was a terrible, over thought dumb adventure to some planet that everything is the same."
4,A fantasy that will leave you thinking!,"The Murry family is smart but miserable. Their father disappeared one day. They are living in agony.One day Meg Murry, Charles Wallace Murry, and their friend, Calvin, meet some strange ladies. Their names are Mrs. Whatsit, Mrs. Who, and Mrs. Which. The ladies want to help the children find their father. To do so, they must travel through time and space. They must also fight the evil Black Thing and IT. Will the children succeed in their mission? Will they rescue their father? This is an adventure you will want to read. This journey is exciting and fascinating. It's a little confusing, but the ending explains everything. I really enjoyed reading this book because of its smart wit. The author, Madeleine L' Engle, makes this book seem real. It feels like the whole book is coming to life, even the magical creatures. I want to read the next book in the series, A Wind in the Door. I hope that book is as great as this one!"
4,exciting yet mysterious,"I really liked this book because it has suspense, excitement, grief AND romance! All of the different emotions in this book let YOU choose how to feel in certain parts of A Wrinkle in Time. But sometimes you get caught up in all these emotions and you get a little confused , like sometimes I didn't know what to think of Aunt Beast,Calvin,or even Charles Wallace! If you are looking for an exciting yet mysterious book or even just a fun book, you better get A Wrinkle in Time by Madeleine L'engle! Remember, a 4 star book is a good book!"
2,"A Wrinkle in Time, audio book","It's not possible to completely ruin this book, which is a classic, but the author's narration comes close. Her reading is almost painfully bad, with slurpy S's, oddly placed emphases and a wooden, sing-song cadence. I love the story, so I'll struggle through to the end, but I won't be getting any more of the series. Ms. L'Engle is a master storyteller, but she should leave the narrating to professionals."
4,A book that stands the test of time,"My grandmother gave me (along with my lifelong love of books)a copy of ""A Wrinkle in Time"" for my 10th birthday. I've probably read it 5 times since then. The adventures of Meg, Charles Wallace and Calvin share a special place in my memories of childhood. It is always the 1st book I recommend to friends for their children and I have given copies to my nieces. I can't wait until my newest nephew is old enough to read it. He will certainly be getting a copy."
4,The battle between good and evil.,"I have often heard people comment about how good this book is, but I've never taken the time to read it before now. I can't say that I was mislead. This is a highly imaginative tale of good vs. evil, told from the point of view of young Meg Murry. Meg is smart but rebellious, fiercely protective of her unusual family. She and her brother, Charles Wallace, are about to go on a journey through space and time to find their long absent father, and in the process, confront an evil so powerful that it threatens to engulf them all.Written with vivid imagery, this story is a fantasy wrapped inside some of the conventional trappings of science-fiction. Along the way, we consider the nature of evil, how it robs people of their individuality and choice. In the end, discovering the one thing evil can't do will be the key to Meg's victory."
3,"Dry, long-winded, and very dated jokes","First, some criticisms. The book is long--one might have guessed that being concise is as much a necessity for a book on jokes as it is for the jokes, but it would not be apparent when reading this long-winded book. The writing is dry and many of the jokes are very dated.There is good advice buried in these hundreds of pages. I don't know that it is worth the cover price--I picked up the book at a book swap and was glad not to have paid for it. There's even a joke within that blames World War II on atheism. Really, Mr, Perret, you couldn't have written something better than that?In any case, this isn't a book you can finish in a short period of time."
3,A rare opera,"This is a very good way to get into this masterwork from Landi. Unfortunately, the DVD is reducing the impact of the production. I attended one of the performances at The Theatre Des Champs Elysees, and part of the magic is lost.But Jarouski and Cencic are fantastic! And what a beautiful music!"
3,very basic,"Only for beginners, not that many words and only basic phrases, but handy for people just wanting to get a feel of the language."
1,"Worst hosts in television history, besides the McNeelys!","This had potential to be quite a great series, but they REALLY screwed it up by putting in those hosts! Where did they get these people that ""put their lives on hold for 14 weeks"". Who wouldn't put their lives on hold?? And it's not putting your life on hold, it's expanding your life!The hosts are unappreciative bubble boy, American flag tshirt wearing, F150 truck driving, Walmart shopping, suburb couple that are extremely uneducated and I can't emphasize MORE how UNAPPRECIATIVE they are. Profoundly can not stand that couple!They anger me.Horrible, DO NOT buy this DVD!!"
4,interesting show,"this DVD was delivered as promised, and in good shape, excactly what I ordered. shows some interesting places. I like this kind of DVD. a good travel DVD. you do need to like travel log videos, as this is what it is. travel and adventure."
1,Don't buy this!,"You will waste your money if you buy this. At first it worked fine, but then 3 months later it would not turn on. I called lasonic and no one answered or returned my call."
5,Better than Plastic,"When I replaced my P4 Northridge CPU with a P4 Prescott CPU, I needed a new retention bracket to secure the large heat sink and cooling fan. This metal bracket did the trick and is better than the plastic bracket that it replaced."
3,UMD version,"Good Movie, average UMD.Positives: Scene selection, good picture quality, great at times.Negatives: A black strip is on top and on the bottom of the picture, as if you were watching it on a regular T.V. Otherwised it would have been great."
3,I have trouble with the whole Arthurian concept of governing,"I have to admit, this idea that King Arthur ruled what is now known as England because he was chosen by the Lady of the Lake to wield Excalibur is a bit farfetched.I mean, strange women lyin' in ponds distributin' swords is no basis for a system of government. Supreme executive power derives from a mandate from the masses, not from some farcical aquatic ceremony. Seriously, you can't expect to wield supreme executive power just because some watery tart threw a sword at you. I mean, if I went 'round sayin' I was Emperor, just because some moistened bint lobbed a scimitar at me, they'd put me away."
1,The Worst Movie I've Ever Seen!,"I saw this epic and wondered throughout when it was going to start. It had no plot, dull characters, and more violence than dialouge. The only decent actor was Keira Knightley, who didn't appear until half-way through the movie, and seemed very down-played.Arthur, played by Clive Owen, was a very boring character - he would only do what was right, and he always triumphed. Whenever things started to seem more dull than usual, they killed someone off to make the stakes higher. About half-way through the movie, I started wished it'd be Arthur who died.The point of this movie seemed to be: If you think you're right and they're wrong, kill them.I wish I could get those 140 minutes of my life back."
4,King Arthur,"Pretty good movie, although thankful for the directors cut. Excellent extras on the DVD including a cool Round Table discussion with the cast and director."
4,Good,It is such a good movie! Thanks so much for the movie! The packaging was good as well. I will look for more from this person.
5,Excellent movie - great on Blu-ray,"I really enjoyed this movie. I like it so much, I think I've viewed it 3 times. The picture quality on Blu-ray is excellent! It has a good story, good acting, and lots of great action scenes."
2,Once you're past the...,"historically inaccurity of the movie, the out-of-character depiction, and the terrible script work - this movie is still only slightly enjoyable.Although I must give props to the editing, sound, and cinematographer, overall the only redeeming moment in this film is when Knightley makes the sharp reply to ""Theres a lot of lonely men out there..."" Her reply: ""Don't worry, I won't let them rape you.""If you aren't looking for a historically accurate piece, or any representation of the times being depicted, then this might suit you."
1,Unbelievable,"Yes, I sat through it. Fuqua must have watched Braveheart 100 times saying to himself, ""If we spend a lot, make it really long, throw in a little romance and have ample bloody battle scenes, then we can win an Oscar...it's that simple, right? This hideous beast had the stench of Made for TV rising throughout. The script, muddled with tired recapitulations of freedom speeches and superficial treatment of...well everything, gave no life to this amazing legendary figure and time period. The set designs were cheap looking, the supporting cast lackluster, directing job amatuerish, the music score bland, the sound effects squishy-stabby, battle scenes were nothing but poor imitations of Braveheart. The lead Saxon bad guy King sounded like a biker from Houston who has to be stabbed about 8 times with large sword before he finally dies. And all these are the high points. What an abysmal failure of a film!"
2,Not in the same league as Gladiator.,"I have no problem with the concept of this movie, however the execution was poor. Clive Owen is simply unconvincing, he just comes across as too weak when you compare him to the other knights. I just could not understand why they would follow him, as he didn't convey the charisma that a strong leader would definitely possess. I think he is a good actor but he was mis-cast in this role.The cinematograhpy of the big battle set pieces was good, however the other scenes come across as flat, and the camera work is iffy.The screen play again had some good ideas but they were just not brought together very well. It just seemed disjointed---maybe this was the editing.Compared to Troy and Gladiator this movie is definitely 2nd rate."
2,Not Impressed,"The only thing worse than Clive Owens'acting is the crappy faux history presented in this movie. Leave it to some 21st century hollywood knucklehead to think that he can re-write classical literature and do a better job of it. The first fight scene is fun but every additional fight scene becomes ubsurd. This climaxes in a final battle that includes characters dressed in what looks to be Chinese and Japanese battle dress. One character even sword fights in the samurai style. The choreography of the samurai guy and main bad guy is excellent and the main bad guy wins. Then up comes Arthur and the choreography drops to levels of luke and darth in the first star wars movie, basically reproducable by any children with brooms. Of course Arthur is able to win with his inferior swordplay. I would recommend reading any of the Mary Stewart Arthurian stuff or The Green Knight or watching excalibur instead. Heck go get the animated disney movie."
1,Way too little...,"Am I the only person who saw this film, who also happened to read the ""Camulod Chronicles"" by Jack Whyte? If you like the idea of Arthur being descended from Romans, this film will leave a bad taste in your mouth. Please start with ""The Skystone, Camulod Chronicles book 1""."
3,Worth watching....,"If you liked 300, Glatiator and those peroid type of movies you will like this one. Although the story line is no where as cool as 300/Glatiator, the movie has great battle sceens and the overall look of the movie was very artistic. For the girls there were lots of strong men doing valliant deeds and for the guys.....there were lots of strong men hacking at eachother ! And there's that skinny girl from Pirates, it was a really good role for her. She was a bit scary and very brave. Give it a try."
3,Definately Not 'King' of Arthur Tale,"I expected more from ""King Arthur."" I found the pacing s-l-o-w and the battle sequences non impressive. The movie was over produced, and under cooked. The story ventures from the familiar tale, having Merlin as some kind of evil General out to get Arthur. Guennie kicks [...], but is still somewhat out of context. I kept thinking there is something missing, perhaps a better movie lurks underneath. A little long, but still it does have some moments. It is beautifully filmed. The locations are spectacular, and you get to know more about the other knights. Quite frankly they were more interesting than Arthur. Takes itself way to serious and has no comic relief to ease the tension. Maybe there will be a director's cut one day and I can see what was missing. One good scene could elevate this film and make it clearer and easier to watch."
3,Interesting new interpretation,"This film boasts a talented cast, great fight scenes and a more dark and realistic atmosphere than other, more hollywood styled versions of the famous legend. Well worth a see.**NOTE** It would be nice if the American reviewers got their basic facts strait (eg - the man's name was William the Conquerer, not Norman and Britain was not called Gaul - that was the name the Romans used for modern day France.***"
4,Smooth... relaxing... involving (bad pun.. I know.),"One listen to Involver, and you will probably be blown away by Sascha's remixing and producing skills. The entire way the album flows is just pure magic, and each track seems to contain parts of one another in order to create a steady flow of music that puts you in a pure solid state of mind. It is sometimes cold and chilled, but it is also sometimes heavy and upbeat and almost funky. There are elements that could almost be traced back to the likes of NIN's ""The Fragile"" and in other places Daft Punk."
3,Bittersweet,"Sasha bears the curse of the fleeting genius: much of his work suffers by mere association with the master touch. So here, while BELONG and BURMA shine, the remainder are not much more than those pleasant enough trails that lead to Great Moments.I see the Northern Exposure references are being trotted out. Apart from the bald fact that the artist, no matter his lot, seeks judgement only on his last, comparisons in this instance simply have no foundation. The Northern Exposure series didn't shoot for that high-pressure brilliance; they demanded a little less and by my reckoning are much the better for it./Infrequently brilliant."
3,Let There Be DV!!!,This another in the ongoing direct to vid shot on dv ghost stories flooding the market right now.When an aspiring writer and his not so supermodle wife move to LA for a fresh start the home they inhabit as well as their new neighbors are not quiet what they seem.The relationship between the couple begins to crumble when he becomes more Hollywood buffing up quitting smoking and attending trendy parties while she starts seeing dead people and wonders wether the place is haunted or if she is in fact crazy.The film plays out like a cheap Shining knockoff with hints of about a dozen or more films of this genre.However considering the low budget nature GHOSTS is a very smooth watch as long as your not expecting too much because it is slow and in the end the movie is little more than a tele drama.Not bad.Not Great.Overall a healthy and intresting viewing experience.
3,Good,"I enjoyed this book but nearly as much as her others. If this had been my first Gibson book, I probably would have given it four stars. It just entertain me as much as the others. I liked Joe and Gabrielle. I didn't even mind the New Age stuff. I did think that the resolution was lacking. Would Joe have sought her out if she hadn't shown up at the party? I was not convinced."
4,HAHAHA....,"I give it a 4 stars because I like her 'truly madly yours' better. But, it doesn't mean that this one is not the signature of Rachel Gibson as well.. Believe me it is so funny that I won't suggest anyone read it in public transport... because, it is quiet embarassing when you try not to laugh but do anyway.Watchout on the scene when Gabrielle invites the macho detective to dinner and has him cook for BOTH of them... and also, the conversation in the dining table... hahaha..."
5,I loved this book and laughed out loud a number of times,"This book was delightful. I read it while on vacation and my friend kept looking at me because I kept laughing! The situations and dialog were terrific. I read alot, and am very critical! And to find a book that I can read in one sitting (or two) is wonderful. They are few and far between! I highly recommend this book. The friend who was on vacation with me read it after I did, and she laughed too! We both loved it!"
4,Promising author,This is my first book by Rachel and it is really good. The main characters of Nick and Gabby are excellent and sexy scenes are really plentiful in this book. The writing is reminisent of Jennifer Cruzie in some ways. I will look for her other books in the future.
3,I COULD HAVE SKIPPED THIS ONE---,"I immediately started reading another book after I finished this one and realized I was trying to get an unpleasant taste out of my mouth, so-to-speak. Parts of this book were interesting, but not enough to make it enjoyable. The main character was a little too ""new age"" for me, the story too drawn out, and the author didn't make me feel the romance. Basically a waste of time."
2,Disappointing,"Very sluggish! Very disappointing! How can one turn passionate music into boring? Well, IMHO, Mutter did just that."
4,Nice Jacket with an Outter zipper Houdini could not open,"I received this jacket and upon opening the package was quite impressed by the quality and workmanship. The jacket as packed came with the zippers closed. When I attempted to open the jacket I found it extremely difficult to separate the zipper at the bottom of the jacket as the it was sewn deeply into the material. In addition the bottom of the zipper was exrtremely close to the bottom of the fabric. I eventually got it open and hung it up until I wore it two days later. Again I had extreme difficulty getting the zipper to close and open. I requested an exchange, which Amazon promptly facilitiated. The replacement had exactly the same problem. I kept the jacket, at the close out price it is well worth keeping. If you have arthritic problems this coat is not for you. Other reviewers did not mention this problem, which has suprised me. I do agree that the jacket is in every other way an excellent value."
5,"best anime and Manga I ever read, and seen","my title explains it.This is one of the best Viz Graphic novels i've ever read. The anime is one of the best I ever saw, too."
4,Worth the Cost!,"Works great. Definitely happy with the purchase. At first wasn't sure I wanted to spend this amount of money on a monitor, but am very happy I did. The handheld monitor keeps its charge for a long period of time. The picture is fairly clear. The dimensions of the screen is nice. And you can easily hear sounds. I can usually hear my daughter breathing through it. It's nice to have the color, but it's really not neccessary."
3,Description misleading.,"Not happy with the battery life, I've had this for under a week and the monitor consistently dies in the middle of the night. Also, it's black and white except when there is a TON of light in the room, meaning direct sunlight and/or an ceiling light."
2,Doesn't last for the price,"I love Amazon for its reviews, but I've learned the hard way that some things that used to be great - and therefore have high ratings - are no longer so hot.This monitor is one of them. It was great at first, but just didn't last long enough considering the price. The sound becomes really staticy. The audio goes in & out - and you have no way of knowing this unless you stare at the monitor.The video is now going out. We ordered a replacement battery and that helped for about a month.This is a $200 monitor that lasts like a $75 one."
3,Terrible Static,"This video monitor is great...if you can sleep through all the static it makes! I am very disappointed after reading so many good reviews that this monitor makes so much noise. I am a very heavy sleeper and this monitor kept me awake. The video picture is awesome, too bad it's so loud."
1,Where is the color?,"I should have read the reviews prior to purchasing this monitor. I'm 5 ft away and get no reception. There is also no color. Thought it was just that particular monitor, but when I returned it and got another one, it was the same problem. Guess I'll be returning this one too!"
2,SO DISAPPOINTED,I AM SO DISAPPOINTED I WAS LOOKING FORWARD TO THIS PRODUCT FOR MY NEWBORN SON. THE RECEPTION IS HORRIBLE I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE GOOD SINCE I HAVE 2.4G TELEPHONE SYSTEMS BUT I THOUGHT WRONG. EVERYTHING INTERFERES WITH THE VIEW I GUESS YOU HAVE TO NOT OWN ANYTHING ELECTRONIC FOR IT TO WORK GOOD. WHEN YOU DO GET A GOOD SPOT IT DOES COME CLEAR BUT WHATS THE POINT OF IT BEING PORTABLE THEN? P.S I HAVE YET TO SEE COLOR THE VIEW APPEARS TO BE BLACK AND WHITE AT ALL TIMES OF DAY .......... I WILL BE RETURNING IT TODAY
5,Loved it!,"I bought 2 of these. One for each kid. I used them until they were about 4. It gave me peace of mind to have the monitor on the nightstand at night. The picture we pretty clear, even in the dark. I would definitely recommend this to a friend."
2,Static static and more static,"I cannot use this baby monitor where my wireless router is, which happens to be my bedroom. There is way too much static. What's funny is when I walk around the room, the static gets worse. It's like my body gets in the middle of the interference between my router and my monitor. I have issues with the volume too. It's either loud or quiet. The monitor is heavy too. Can't wear this one on your pajama bottoms without losing your pants. The picture is decent and the battery life is good. I'm off to search for another monitor without interference."
2,Loved it while it worked- 1 yr!,"i bought this monitor when my son was born 1 yr ago. We LOVED it while it worked, however it lost complete battery charge after 2 weeks and would only work when plugged in. Last week the screen went black and was no longer receiving a signal. i contated summer infant co and they informed me that they only have a 1 yr warranty and since i do not have proof of purchase (rec'd as a gift) then they could not help me. so unless you want to spend $200 a year then this monitor is not for you!!"
1,HORRIFIED TO SEE MY NEIGHBORS BABY ON THE OTHER CHANNEL!,"I purchased this monitor some time ago and it worked fine (though it buzzed all the time...we just got used to it).However, after reading other reviews mentioning security issues with the monitor channels showing other neighboring babies, I thought I would check my other channel. Needless to say, I was horrified to see our neighbors little boy sleeping soundly on the other channel! After calling Summer Infant, they confirmed that if I can see them, they can see us too! We have the monitor set up to see our daughter's entire room and it runs 24/7, so when we go to tuck her in at night (in our pajamas), or anything else throughout the day, our neighbors have been able to see and hear everything! Summer realizes this is a ""problem"", so they offered to replace my monitor with the Secure baby monitor at no cost.I WOULD NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT as anyone with the same monitor can also see yours."
2,still searching for a good video monitor,"I was dissapointed by the picture quality of this monitor. Also, you can only see color when there is bright light in the room- so when baby is sleeping, the picture is black and white and not that clear. I returned mine immediately-it is not worth the money. I then bought the $100 bigger screen black and white summer monitor only to be let down by the reception of that model. I even brought that one to babiesrus to have then test it in the store and they too could not get good reception. Still looking for a good product!"
5,excellent!,"Generally, I am not fond of Von Karajan's Beethoven recordings. This definitely is an exception. I think it is excellent in every way. Fine performances all around are matched by a solid recording. And the wonderful, although often neglected, concerto is nicely balanced with the master's most famous orchestral overtures."
3,Another collectors CD for Pat..,"I was looking through Amazon.com and found this CD,anotherPat cd!!!! Wow!!! I had read it was compared Pat's solo album.This is good , that Pat plays all the instruments,the bad thing is it has a re-occuring line that is heard all the way through this CD,which kinda gets old. I commend Pat for playing all the instruments,but just does not have that ""Metheny magic"" as displayed in other CDs................"
4,the Gift,"The CD arrived in excellent condition and was well packaged. It was an import so understandibly took a little while to arrive, but as it was not easily attainable, it was worth the wait. Would use the seller again."
4,Pretty Much the Gold Standard for Longboard Trucks,"I bought a pair of these to replace the serviceable but unimpressive Gullwing trucks that came on my Sector 9 longboard. The appearance and handling on these are a significant improvement. Also, you can flip the hangar so that the ""180"" faces inside towards the deck if you want to change the handling. Only drawback are the generic, spongy bushings -- which I've upgraded to the great Khiro insert bushings. Also, pivot cups on my pair were squeaky at first. This can be remedied with a few drops of cooking oil in the pivot cup. DON'T use WD-40 or any other petroleum-based lubricant as it will eat the cup (and your bushings)."
5,It grew on me...,"Listening to it at first, I didn't care for it. But that's how all of my favorite albums start out.Usually when I buy a dance compilation album, one CD is stronger than the other, but both CDs are equally wonderful and give you more than your money's worth.The first CD, Trance/Progressive, is of a genre I'm not a fan of, yet I find myself playing it constantly. The second CD, House, is what I really love about this collection.This is the first volume; I can see myself getting future volumes of this mix."
1,Never got it!,"I was really excited to order it, but was very disappointed when i received an e-mail telling me you couldn't send it. Bummer! I have been a Wallace and Gromit fan for years!"
3,Don't recall,"The truth is, I don't recall this book. I don't recall seeing it, ordering it, or reading it, much less recieving it."
2,Disappointed by Censoring,"I was very disappointed that The Deadliest Catch is 'bleeped' on DVDs for home sale. I didn't mind on TV...but did not expect the retail DVDs to be bleeped...and there is no rating shown on the selling site to warn you. I wanted the whole series, but won't buy any more. It's not that I love swearing, either! I guess it's just the awful 'bleeping', and fuzzing over the mouth..it makes me wish to just hear what they're saying. I just think we should have a choice."
4,Good perspective,"Looking for a different perspective on ADHD? Here it is. The book doesn't try to whitewash the very real concerns of ADHD, yet manages to reveal some positive aspects. And it provides some coping strategties and ""lessons learned"" that can benefit the whole family."
2,I dont know,When I started reading this book I thought it was great that the authors used many examples from their lives and the lives of their kids. But throughout the book I felt I was learning more and more about the lives of the kids in their family rather than about ADHD. There are much better books out there for ADHD than this one.I do have to say that the chapters that the docotr wrote were great (the Q&A; one and the ones about treatments). Good job doc!
4,A fun book for the recreational musician and/or singer.,This book contains 250 popular Broadway songs. I have found that it works nicely for any actor or musician. The songs are fairly easy to play and fun to sing.
1,Why do many opera singer want to record musicals?,"Many opera stars want to record musicals today. Some of them are good (not bad), the others are horrible. Among them, this recording is too bad for the musical lovers. Why do they cast Kiri Te Kanawa as Maria and Jose Carreras as Tony? I hate too this recording because they wants the musical lovers and classical fan to buy. Unfortunately, I did buy. And now I'm very regret to buy one. Sigh...If you want to hear the real ""West Side Story,"" listen to the original cast or the original soundtrack."
4,"Nice setting, nice cast","This book is set in the wine country north of San Francisco, and you will learn a fair amount of presumably accurate stuff about wine, history, and geography, enough to make you want to visit the area yourself.The cast of characters is large but well depicted. On the whole neither the police nor the amateur sleuth/tour-guide achieve much with their detection until the sudden denouement explains all. Still, a pretty enjoyable read throughout, and there are enough clues that you might solve the case ahead of them."
2,Memory Stick Pro ... not for pros,"While researched before purchase, it did not become apparent that Memory Stick Pro is a proprietary application for Sony and does not work generically in a computer for loading to same and thus was returned which was cheerfully and quickly acknowledged and accepted (still awaiting refund)."
5,"Useful, affordable size storage device",This is an affordable size Memory Stick Pro that has enough room for lots of high-res photos and/or movies. It's finally less painful to pay for Sony-compatible storage devices.
1,isn`t that sony cybershot dsc-h5 need,"i buy this memory in combo with a camera sony cybershot dsc-h5 by amazon, and this memory stick pro dont be used with that camera."
1,not compatable with my camera,"but of course, that's because my camera is a Sony DSC -S75. from 2002. so if you have old cameras like me, do not buy this product."
2,not very helpful reference,this book has been pretty useless as a reference book. The author covers too many topics but doesn't stay focused on one topic. He mentions available features of Java but does not provide very good examples on a particular subject. I had a much easier time finding good examples and explanations in the Exploring Java and Core Java books.
5,Excellent,"This is the best book on computer programming I have yet read.This book leads the reader through clear, logical approaches to addressing various circumstances which arise when writing good software in Java. With the author's style of weaving threads of thought from different areas of consideration, the reader's understanding is developed far more than a list of ""recipes"" can do.I recommend this book thoroughly to anyone interested in good Java programming."
3,Complicated Examples,Excelent book with a good logical sequence. But Bruce's examples are sometimes so complex that it's harder to understand the five level class diagram than the theory behind it.
4,Sets a high standard in computing literature,"In terms of writing syle, this is certainly one of the best text books of any kind I have read. All of the core concepts are explained clearly, usually from first principles. The author explains how things were before Java, thus providing necessary context.Most importantly, he has his own voice. His enthusiasm for Java is not evangelical; it is based on what it can actually do. He does not jump on the bandwagon, looking down on those who don't ""get it"". The audience for this book is the intelligent artisan who has developed code before in some form. He certainly writes in a robust manner that assumes that his readers have thought about programming problems and issues.A great book for those who want a more complete understanding of Java in particular and modern programming in general."
4,A superior book that could have been so much better.,"This is definitely a superior book. However, it could have been so much better -- if the author had been able to explain his thoughts clearly and concisely, leaving his sample code to validate the reader's understanding. Instead, the sample programs are the basis of the book. The reader should be prepared to supplement most pages of this book with Sun's documentation (which too often has needed descriptions of not only the methods, but also of the class concepts)."
2,Doesn't match product description,"The product is great quality, but does not match the product description below it. I wanted and thought I was going to get a tape that measured in feet/inches on one side and meters/centimeters on the other. This item only measures in feet/inches. Big disappointment."
3,Gypsy Soul is OK,"I have other gypsy/flamenco CDs, and purchased this one based on some other reviewers comments (on the other CDs). I prefer the CD Gypsy Passion over this one by a wide margin."
5,Midnight Run,"Robert DeNiro...Charles Groden...priceless...funny comedy with Bobby being a bounty hunter, forget Dog the Bounty hunter and check Bobby out as one...if anything can go wrong it does go wrong...you will laugh."
4,Don't Laugh; This Is DeNiro's Best Perfomance!,"We all know about Godfather II, Taxi Driver, and Raging Bull. Well here is a film that is not only a four star gem, but just happens to contain Robert DeNiro's best performance. As Jack Walsh, the worn bounty hunter assigned to bring back missing mob accountant Charles Grodin, DeNiro combines humor with true human qualities to give a multi-layered performance that almost everyone watching can in some way relate.Charles Grodin is appealing as well as the clean-cut ""Robin Hood"" and makes you say, ""why did he ever take that TV show?""Martin Brest is at his directing best, and is able to create a film with memorable characters played by wonderful character actors such as Dennis Farina, Joe Pantilione, Tom Keough, and John Ashton."
5,The best comedy ever,"After about 50 viewings and a 'hit' of Midnight Run every 2/3 months, the scene at the end when Alonso smiles at Sorrano in the airport is still the greatest ever. The best action comedy ever made - but please, people, help me - after 10 years of trying - can I find anybody who stocks the soundtrack ??? Please email me if you can. Go see Midnight Run and buy the video - the best anti-depressant ever."
3,That 70's Time Warp,"This CD has not aged well, and, for me at least, is hard to listen to. The musicians are skilled (Hancock and Paul Jackson of course, but especially Mike Clark on drums), but the keyboard/synthesizer sound is dated. Of course if you want that 70's cool jazzfunkfusion - with lots of electronic analogue effects you never hear anymore - you may just love it.I like his piano based (and 5 star)Maiden Voyagemuch more. It may be from the mid-60's but it is timeless, cool and sophisticated. THRUST just seems cheesy in comparison."
2,This is not Jazz. This is not Herbie Hancock. This is nothing at all!,It is incredible how pop-rock has invaded some illuminated minds and made such cool and nonsense sound flow from so privilleged musicians.You'll find a technically great keyboardist here playing sequences and sequences of unimportant sounds with master command of his instrument.This is not the right thing to expect from composer and musician Herbie Hancock.
3,"Four Stars for Kiss, but what's with Best Buy's new story about bonus tracks?","The Best Buy in my town now is saying it's the customer's duty to call Universal Music at ""the phone number listed inside the box set"" to get Universal to mail us replacement discs. What's up with that? During my previous Best Buy visit, they said that yes, 13 replacement discs were en route to their store, but that none of the replacment discs had been received in ANY of Best Buy's regional stores around here. What's up? Please enlighten me ..."
2,Would have been better,"Had this been done earlier. For instance, if none of their albums weren't ALREADY available and they were just now releasing them on Disc. But since the ""KISS"" albums for the most part were already re-mastered way back in '97 up to ""Crazy Crazy Night's"" anyway, there really wasn't any need for this box set save for the re-master of ""Alive 3"" & the unreleased ""Millennium"" concert. Just another part of the M-O-N-E-Y game, the all mighty dollar. Sure, this is a great place to start, if you're just getting into KISS, but who didn't already have everything in this box set except the ""Millennium"" concert? If they'd just finished re-mastering the catalog where they left off at and released the ""Millennium"" show separate, that would have saved alot of people some Money and also we would have had the rest of the albums re-mastered."
3,Slightly gothic EBM tracks,"This EP is far better than ""Second Path"", although that doesn't say much. If I heard this EP when it was originally released I'd probably have enjoyed it more. The first few tracks are OK, mostly EBM (the dark kind), my personal favourite being ""Freezeout"". The last 2 tracks are utterly avoidable though - too much angst (Wumpscut?). Maybe this is what happens when, as their Haujobb incarnation, they released such brilliance as ""Solutions For A Small Planet"" - expectations became unrealistic."
4,"An interesting ""Four Seasons""...","In this curious album, Maestro Zubin Mehta and the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra invte a party of four of the most talented male violinists to perform Antonio Vivaldi's ""Four Seasons"" and have each of them do one of the seasons. In this live recording (there is also an applause after the end of each music), Stern (one of my favorite violinists) starts off in the spotlight with ""Spring"", Zukerman awes us with ""Summer"", Mintz delights us with ""Autumn"", and Perlman (my other favorite) shines and round off the cycle with ""Winter"". While some listeners (including myself) may dislike the relatively slow and heavy tempo in contrast to other lighter recordings (including Shaham with the Orpheus Chamber Orchestra, in my opinion the best performance of the cycle), it's interesting to listen to and feel the four soloist's different insights. It's worth listening."
5,WONDERFUL AND BEAUTIFUL,"You've got gorgeous music by the best artists in the world! I've given copies to several music-lover friends who were delighted with it, too. I highly recommend this CD."
3,Vivaldi Four seasons,Excellent musicians and a great composition but was recorded in the early 80's and the techonogy wasn't as good as more recent recordings.
2,Bad artwork and lousy editing DO NOT equal charm,"The reviewer who thinks all modules contemporaneous with Scourge had lousy art and apparently no editing should check out Lost Caverns of Tsojcanth or the Giants modules or Tomb of Horrors, all of which had good to great art and decent proofreading, and, most importantly, pre-date this truly awful example of a decent adventure ruined by carelessness. I bought the original modules new, and I was appalled at how lousy this collected edition was. We RPG players who didn't complain about such trash got what we deserved from TSR for many years: a flood of junk. Thank God Wizards of the Coast saved AD&D."
1,Wrong music,"I don't know if this is any good. I meant to order the alto sax version, but now see this pops up under that search. Unfortunately I ordered a couple months early as a birthday present and was told I could no longer return. It doesn't make me want to order again."
2,Didn't work for me,"After reading the reviews for this product, I decided to buy it and try it for myself. I'm 24 years old and I rarely had acne as a teenager, but I've been having some problems these past few years. I tried proactiv and I noticed a difference but I wasn't completely satisfied with the results. I started using Loreal about 1 month ago and at first (after the 3rd day or so) I thought it was getting better-hopeful wishing-but then it just went downhill. I still continued to use it thinking that it might work if I give it some time and follow the exact instructions but after 3 weeks I gave up. My acne is even worse and I have acne in places that I've never had before (jaw area). It might work for some people but unfortunately it didn't work for me. If you have the money and are desperate to find something that works, I recommend trying it out for 2-3 weeks. It might work for you or it might not. A shot in the dark if you ask me."
1,I would not reccomend this book.,"I read this at an airport: the only reason I finished it is I had nothing else to read. The author tries to come off as angry and satirical, but just comes off as immature. Maybe if you're 16 and taking drama in school this would be an insightful read."
4,Good Source of Information,"I'm old enough to remember when I could go out in the garage on a Saturday and rebuild the carburetor in a couple of hours.Now-a-days you cannot even find the engine without removing the shrouding and usually there is no carburetor. So, yes times have changed! You must have information on the technology used on your particular vehicle to have any hope of working on it.What is it? (how does it work?)Where is it?What does it look like?How do I fix/replace it?This book does a good job of answering these questions and I am very happy with it. I would recommend that anybody who needs information on their vehicle get one of these."
3,hawai cd,"Not as much of a luau party cd as I thought it would be. It was ok, glad I didn't pay alot of money for it."
5,Absolute Classic,"This appears on a number of lists of must have Java books, and it is definitely on mine.The first time it saves you five hours otherwise spent on some little Java detail that compiles but doesn't work as expected(with over 1000 classes it is getting difficult to know all of them by heart), it has paid for itself over and over again.Since I lack the time to inspect the Java source code to understand precise implementation details, I find this book invaluable. I only hope that another edition comes out."
5,Tests the sanctity of life-long beliefs,"In Great Adventure: A Coming Of Age At Going ON Fifty by Mary M. Mayhew, we meet Muriel ""Boo-Boo"" Knowlton, a 50-something woman confronted with the a series of life changes both physical, social, familial, psychological, and personal. Set in small-town America Muriel tests the sanctity of life-long beliefs, marital assumptions, altering parenthood relationships; and the need to discover whether her life can be a ""great adventure"" or if she will simply slip off into an asexual, gray hair counting, time-killing, increasingly restricted lifestyle of non-adventurous aging. Great Adventure is recommended reading for any woman (or man!) who has crossed over into their 50s and wondering what, if anything, life can be made to offer them."
2,One giant bean,"I got these because I love them and they were so cheap. I can see why, as they arrived all stuck together in one clump. You have to pick up the ten-pound lump and pull off a clump to eat. They still taste good, but are not usable for company. Really disappointing, and sticky as they are, they stain the fingers quite badly."

4,Bought it for a friend,"Bought this for a friend's birthday and the feedback from him was it is really fun. However, the casting powder might not be sufficient for those who are truly well endowed like my friend, lucky sod."
3,Not too happy,"I had been reading that the process was hard but i found it to be very easy however with the vibrator in there is still a good half inch of free space, the kit doesn't come with near enough rubber. Worthless"
4,Lots of fun....slightly messy,This was a fun product to try and it was fun to figure out how to use. It was bought on a whim and when used it was slightly challenging to use with the strict time constraints but was fun and hopefully the finished product is worth it! ;-)
2,You snooze you loose!!!,THe easy to follow instructions say to complete mold in 2 mins but you really need to be done in a disappointing 1 min 30 secs. Everything was executed per the instructions until the molding material was pored in the tube. you literally have like 10 seconds to pour and mold. It was disappointing that at less than 2 minutes the molding material was to hard to even start the cloning process.
3,Difficult to um... use haha,"I had some difficulty using this product and now have to order more ""stuff"" so that sucks. Definitely worth trying"
3,Buy a case of condoms with this,"This thing worked ok-was very fun to make, and use when complete. The only down side-and I felt it was a big one- after using it when the product is complete you cant lick it like you would the real thing. It tastes like silicone and you'll need to clean yourself very very good after using it so you dont stink like silicone as well."
4,Kewpie,"This was hard to find! Good price, I love using it on my sushi will keep buying! Package is super squeezable!"
1,Wash hands to avoid cancer,This is by far the cheapest and most full featured controller in this price range BUT it comes with a warning sticker about how you need to wash your hands after each use to avoid getting cancer or causing birth defects! Screw that.I think this is despicable business practice and I only wish I could do more to hurt M-Audio's reputation than this.
1,Lead paint on keys! No reply from M-Audio.,"I e-mailed both Behringer and M-Audio about their lead content of the key paint. Beringer wrote back the next day explaining that all their products are lead free. M-Audio didn't reply. I think I have my answer. I will chose the equivalent Behringer model, Behringer UMX610 U-Control 61-Key USB/MIDI Controller Keyboard."
4,good utility,"I use this instrument daily (with my iMac garage band sofeware) for choir practice to make sure I stay on pitch. I like that I can use garage band to easily alter the pitch of the keyboard. Usually I set A (abvove middle c) to 440 mHz for modern music, but I may set it to 435 for Baroque music. I also like having a keyboard that is light weight and I can store it under a bench. Right now I have the keyboard on my ironing board next to my computer. The ironing board is adjustable and gives it a secure base. So I can wait to buy a stand until the stock market recovers - no matter how long that takes."
2,M-Audio Keystation 61ES,"Bought the M-Audio Keystation 61ES to upgrade my Hauptwerk virual organ to a three manual setup. I am pleased to say that the Keystation installed just fine, however, I'm not pleased to say that the 61ES feels like a hunk of junk plastic toy. The keys are loose and flimsy so I won't be surprised if they just break, and break real soon.I expected a more durable controller from M-Audio but you get what you pay for when you buy cheap."
2,Not her best,"I own all three of her CDs. Come Away with Me is the best IMO. Her passion and talent shine through. Each song was worthy to be on the CD. In Feels Like Home, it seemed she relaxed a bit, had a little more fun, but lost some of the passion, a couple of the songs were not up to what I expected, but passed as entertaining. This third CD is the worst. My impression was that now that she has made a name for herself she can put any track on a CD without much scrutiny. I have listened to it a few times, but it just doesn't do anything exciting for me. A big disappointment."
2,Not too late to choose something else.,"It's not too late to say ""pass"" on this newest, but mediocre album of Norah Jones. I don't know why all artists, or nearly all, think they have to go away from what people liked about them in the first place and ""experiment"" or ""grow"" or some other existential bunk.This album contains a collection of mediocrity and experimental dumb stuff that is nothing like what drew me to Norah Jones in the past.Take a good listen to the on-line examples before you waste your money on this one. I didn't do that and bought mine in an advance sale, based on my appreciation of her previous work. That was a mistake.Sorry, Norah. Try again, please."
1,Not Too Late----NOT TOO GOOD !!!!,The first CD was Great.The second ok The Third NO GOOD.I think its to early for her to try to write songs. She should leave the song writting to the writers and do what she does best SING.The sound quality didn't seem to be very good and the cd jacket was no good either.Wish I had my 9.99 back.
5,As always; SOOO GOOD,"A PLEASURE TO LISTEN TO, FANTASTIC TALENT, COMFORTABLE LISTENING, SENSUSAL LYRICS."
5,HER BEST YET,If you already like Norah Jones then this Album will blow you away. Norah has stuck to her formula of heartfelt Jazz with a touch of Country lilt but at the same time has found an aspect on this Album that is very appealing. Definitly her best so far.
3,I just don't listen to it often enough,"WIth that being said, this album has its high points, but its not a fully realized recording like her first two albums. I actually like the second one the most."
2,dull and lacking in effort. Nora needs a good producer,"Her former producer Arif Mardin has passed and she did this with her boyfriend on her own for goodness sakes she is a grammy winner and should have hired someone big to help. I'm a fan of Nora Jones, loved her first album, liked her second but this album is dull. The first nine songs are dreadful but try to hang in there because it does improve at the end. Once you hear Rosie's Lullaby, Be My Somebody, and Not Too Late you'll remember why you're a fan. I bought four songs from this album so I don't feel cheated just disappointed."
4,"Norah's ""Not Too Late"" offers soothing tones and a lot more","""Not Too Late"" is a laid back, relaxing album perfect for long drives in the country or unwinding at home. However, the album avoids being simply a relaxing piece of work by embracing serious themes on occasion, employing unusual instrument choices, and presenting many different moods, some more playful, some more dark. And, most important, throughout the course of this CD, Norah's voice, intonations, and delivery are as great as they've always been. Though some reviewers here have found ""Not Too Late"" to be a little too low-key and maybe even a little dull, I really enjoy it."
3,Nice job Norah!,"I love an album that I can sing to and enjoy the sound of the music- This fits the bill on most of the songs. I love her last album- was hoping for another one of those-not quite, but still good."
3,Easy Listening,"Nora's voice is always easy to listen to. This CD makes great, soothing background music for any boring household work or relaxation time. But, I heard nothing really unique in this selection. She's starting to sound the same."
1,A disappointment,"I was excited to see a new album from Norah Jones that I immediately put it on my wish list. After listening to the tracks and reading the reviews, I promptly took it off my wish list. I was so disappointed to see that Norah has gone the way of so many artists thinking that we want a political science lesson from entertainers. If I want ""entertainment"" views of politics, I can watch the evening news for free. Norah, be different, not a lemming, go back to making music and leave politics to the TV ""news"" reporters."
4,Norah has something to say,"Unlike her first 2 albums which were pretty light and breezy, Norah Jones has something to say with her new album. In one song, she sings she is ashamed a ""deranged"" man has been elected President. In another song, she compares Bush to a captain who has drifted off course and refuses to admit that his ship is sinking. Has Norah learned anything from the Dixie Chicks? One song applauds her freedom of speech rights. We will see if the radio stations agree."
5,Just a Joy and delight!!,Another good one from Norah. She is so smooth and delightful. You will love this one as much as her others. This is one of her best. She is so sweet and that voice of hers. Such a relaxing experience to hear her.
3,Could be worse but still disapointed,"I guess most artists that start out so incredibly well have a hard time finding space to go UP so disapointment should have been expected when I excitedly pre-ordered this album from my favorite ""unwind artist.""Musically, I like some of the songs that stick more to her style but some of the rifs are distractingly identical to previous songs so I wish she could continue the same style without having certain parts musically take you so much to another song that it is hard to enjoy the new song.My biggest disapointment, however, is that she chose to make this album a political platform. While rappers can get away with this as can other genres, Norah's sound is ideal for relax, unwind, and just stop thinking music, with some emotion thrown in. A political platform in multiple songs is distracting and unsettling and that is the primary reason this cd hasn't made my most-listened to playlist."
1,weak,My expectations are too high since her first album. I wasted money on the last two albums; I won't buy another.
2,Not Too Late Review,"It's not too late for you to sell this if you mistakenly pick it up. I really appreciate Norah Jones's talent and dark beauty, but her lack of range has become tiresome, and the songs on this album are weird and lack musicality or hooks. I could not wait to get it out of my CD player in the car and safely on Amazon Marketplace for sale.Better luck next time, Norah. These songs just don't make it for me."
4,pleasantly surprised,"Considering that this is Norah's first album in which she wrote or co-wrote all the tracks, it is surprisingly good. My favorite tracks are Wake Me Up, Little Room, and Sinkin' Soon, although most of the other songs were good as well. The only tracks that were subpar were Until the End, Not My Friend, and Rosie's Lullaby. Overall, a very good album. Would recommend to fans of Norah's and those wanting to see what the fuss is about."
5,Outstanding!,This is Norah's best CD. Choice of songs is brilliant. Jones has created her own style and parrots no one. She is a very independent spirit who is also accepted commercially. Bravo Norah!
2,Not Very Good,"In my opinion, Nora's first album was her best. Her second one wasn't quite as good as the first one, and the third one wasn't special at all. The third one had too much thought behind it and not enough emotion. Too much mind, not enough ""feel."""
1,Yawn,"I was very disappointed with this CD. Sounded like recycled tracks of her first two CDs, and there was not a single song that caught my attention. I listened very carefully, more than once, because I love her voice and her first two efforts.Don't waste your money."
4,I actually enjoyed this album!,"I was eagerly awaiting Norah Jones' third album, but - after reading all the negative reviews - felt a little apprehensive about buying it until I heard it first. What I did hear was very relaxing, kind of folksy/bluesy and very enjoyable. Norah's voice - as always - is as smooth as ""buttah."" Among my favorite tunes: ""Wish I Could,"" ""Sinkin' Soon,"" ""My Dear Country"" and the title track. There are some tunes that are strictly background - and somewhat forgettable - but I thought the album as a whole was very good."
3,nora jones Not Too Late,"Still does not live up to her original grammy hits.However, I am enjoying it.Dottie Webster"
2,Same O - Same O,When such a fantastic artist keeps singing the same style songs over and over they run together and you lose whatever sense she is trying to say. Wait for this one to show up on HBO
1,norah,I loved Norah first album. Hated hated hated her second and now I hate the third. Norah please stop writing such boring material.
5,Sexy Delight,"Like the other review said the vocals are sesually perfect,the music is soothing and stunning,watching her in the dvd the live & the videos damn shes unique, she ain't no studio trick,Norah Jones is for Real and this version is the one to go!!!!!"
3,Disappointed,"I really loved her first, liked the second and was disappointed in the third and newest. It's cute, her voice is wonderful and the orchestration still tops, but I don't listen to it much anymore."
1,Not to Late,"This CD was far below my expectations. It is short and the songs just are not as good as her previous efforts, my wife felt the same way. I was like it was just contract fulfilment material."
2,"slow, not much power","poor RPM not really worth the money, does the job as advertised but too slow and lacks power, would not recommend this product"
5,Happy I found it,"Badly needed these pads for my Scum Buster, Black and Decker no longer sells them directly, this bachelor wore out the originals!"
1,Amazon should be embarrassed,"Bad enough that the toy is a scam that requires extra parts. But the surprise here is the complicity of Amazon in this misleading packaging. This is probably why the product is unavailable suddenly and the battery charger nowhere to be found. They know they made a mistake. If only they would contact us each now for a full refund.I wish a rep from Amazon could have spent the holiday week with my family as we searched from store to store for that charger. I wish he could have spent an afternoon of watching my child stare at the toy he waited for. ..his ""big"" gift."
1,Misleading Advertising,"The ad for the Batman Begins Radio Control Jumping Batmobile says ""1 9V battery required"". I just opened the box and it also requires a 9.6 Volt Turbo NiCd battery.....another $20 or more !!!! I am very disappointed Amazon.com. What's up with this misleading advertising ?? This toy may be on the way back to you."
1,VERY DISSAPOINTING!,"I read the reviews and I still decided t order the car. My son really wanted it. I paid $30.00 dollars for the car and $29.99 for the shipping and handling. While I waited for the car I bought the two batteries for an additional $17.50 but when I finally received the car and tried to place the batteries then I discovered that I need to buy a charger and more batteries. My three year old son is very sad! and my pocket is now empty.I regret buying this car, I should have listened to the reviews.I now have a very dissapointed three year old son..."
1,Bad Batmobile,Very disappointed and is being returned as we speek. The battery is almost impossible to find and even harder to charge. I guess you get what you pay for.
1,DO NOT BUY THIS TOY!,"DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS TOY, THE BATTERY IS NOT AVAILABLE FOR THIS TOY. LEARN FROM MY MISTAKE. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!!!!!!! no where in the product discription does it tell you that the 9.6 volt battery is NOT INCLUDED, all it says, is that you will have to purchase a 9 volt battery for the remote. Don't look for the Tyco 9.6 volt battery in a store or on line, because it will be ""out of stock"". I have been trying to purchase one for 4 months!"
4,Rate the toy not your battery woes,"Venturing into the world of R/C vehicles includes buying batteries. If you don't want batteries then buy the non-R/C Mattel Tumbler which is VERY NICE and LOTS OF FUN. So yes, when you buy this item you're on the hook for batteries but you'll be rewarded with a remote controlled jumping batmobile that works well on pavement and will be alot of fun. Tyco is a solid company and they put out alot of decent R/C toys and for my money their crown jewel is this Batman TANK called Tumbler so get it while you can and the money you save while its on sale can go to buy those batteries...so SMILE."
3,"Wacky, worthwhile","Viewing is virtually a cultural prerequisite, and laughs are to be had, but sometimes it's a bit strained. And if you're younger than perhaps 30 or 35 you may need an cultural guide who's older to act as a consultant."
4,ONE OF THE BESY OUT OF SIX COMEDY MOVIIES I HAD EVER SEEN.,"Spaceballs was so funny It makes Robin Hood: Men in tights, seem like Robin Hood: Men in bad movie. If you havn't seen it, see it. Its great."
1,Good for insomniacs...,"This is the best proof that Mel Brooks had completely lost his touch in the 80's. After making some of the funniest movies ever through the mid-70's, he really stalled in the 80's. This movie has bad writing, bad perfomances, and is one of the dullest movies I've seen."
5,a classic,One of the best Mel Brooks' film and I love Rick Moranis(too bad he retired). I would definitely recommend this to every one!
5,Incredibly Funny,I loved this movie. If you liked star wars and have a sense of humor you will love it. My Girlfriend thought it was funny and she hasn't even seen any of the star wars movies
5,Spaceballs is an AWESOME FILM for anyone!,"The best parody movie I have ever seen! Brooks directs this film very well, and he also is a good actor, playing the parts of President Skroob and Yogurt [May the Schwartz be with you!]. Spaceballs is a great movie to buy and be sure to get it in widescreen is you are a serious collector like me!"
5,Mel Brooks is the Best,"This is probably the worst of the Mel Brooks classics, but given that Brooks is the best comedy film maker of all times, this is still obviously a great movie, and a must for any collector."
1,space suck,"I'm sorry I gotta keep it real, this is with out a doubt one of the worst movies I've ever seen period. just horrible"
3,So stupid it's funny!,I think this movie is funny. Its not suppose to have good acting thats whats so funny! The story line I have to admit is stupid but some of it is funny. I don't like it as much because its a little cheesy!
4,The best movie Brooks has done!,"i can't think of this movie without laughing outloud! Dark Helmet is a character that will live on forever...and every time i watch this movie, there's another joke that i get...there are so many subtle jokes (a word here, an odd saying there) that you're constantly having epiphanies everytime you watch it...and watch it with a group of people...because there are jokes that will go right over your head, but someone else in the room will understand (my mother had a Ford Galaxy when she was younger and had to fill me in on that joke)....and the cast of actors is perfect!"
3,choir is flat,"Listening to this and came to Amazon to see what other commenters were saying about the choir. Nobody has yet mentioned the choir and it must be said. They seem to have excellent credentials and tons of other recordings with famous soloists etc., but the fact of the matter is the women are a teensy bit flat over certain runs and high notes and it kind of ruins it for me. Kathleen is stunning and almost, but not quite, makes up for it."
3,Surprise,"I thought I was purchasing a CD of guided meditations around chakras and colors. Instead it is more like an audio book. The information is interesting and helpful, but this is NOT for people who want a chakra guided meditation."
4,Good Songs but There are Better Ways to Hear APB,"This is a solid collection of early Apop songs but why do this to yourself? Just buy '7' due to its start-to-finish excellence - this is a better intro to APB. Then get the more current 'Welcome to Earth' with at least 5 great songs. If you like those then you can venture deeper in the past and pick up 'Soli Deo Gloria'; you'll find that it is better as an album than this collection. Then go ahead and get the most current disc 'Harmonizer'.In short, good stuff but don't start here. Only for completists IMO (yes, I have it)."
4,A quick and relatively balanced overview of 1000 year of sino-tibet history,"I am not an expert in this area, and just want a quick but balanced overview of the history between Tibet and China to form the basis of my own view of the situation. This book provides exactly that. Any one who read this book will appreciate the complexity of the relationship between the two. Interestingly, it also helps one to understand why UK and US are so interested or dis-interested in Tibet issue during different time in the history. The book made another strong impression on me, that is: how much history is really about the power struggle of the rulers/elite classes in the name of religion/culture/nationalism and so rarely (almost never) is about the people's interest."
2,It's only snippets of the music!,This CD only contains 30-60 second long snippets of each of the pieces. It could be a teaching tool but is not something you can just put on to listen. It does contain reference to popular TV and Film works that contain the music.
3,LACKLUSTER,Much prefer Gilels or Argerich in these. I did like the fact that the piano sound was forward . Love Piano concerti as a rule.
1,BOOOOORING!!!,"This is, by far, the most tedious and boring book I have ever read. I could have wrapped up everything that happens in this book in about 30 pages. Instead, the author, Natalie Babitt, has to SSSSTTTTRRREEECCCHHH this book to about 100 pages more. Probably, the only reason that Ms. Babitt wrote this book is to convince ""wittle kids"" that they shouldn't want to live forever.Great message, Mrs.B. I'll be blamin' you when the suicide rate goes up."
2,Um...,"I didn't really like this book. It was just boring. There was pretty much no action at all. If you want immortality, read The Immortals series by Tamora Pierce."
2,I thought this book was could have had more action in it.,I disliked this book because it was too slow for what I like to read. I thought that it could talk about more details because it basically went on about the same things all through the book. I would recommend this book to people who like books that don't have very much action in them.
2,Tuck Everlasting,"Tuck EverlastingTuck Everlasting had EVELASTING action and description. A girl named Winnie Foster runs away to these mysterious woods were she finds a strange family.The family is made up of Jesse, May, Miles, and Tuck well that's what they call him.The Tucks take Winnie home to tell her a secret they've kept for many years they couldn't die, but they were being followed by a stranger in a yellow suit.Winnie does not believe that the Tucks couldn't die. The Tucks treat Winnie very nicely. She grows to love them but the man in the yellow suit reports to the constable that Winnie has been kidnapped by the Tucks. Winnie is brought home they couldn't press charges on the Tucks because Winnie stayed with them on her own will.Later Winnie finds herself helping a murderer escape from jail.If you love action this book will be great for you."
3,The review for Tuck Everlasting by Me,The book in the beginning is pretty boring.After Winnie met Jesse it got exciting. The end was unexpected. The ending made it a lot better.When the chapter ended I wanted to read the next one then the next until it ended.
4,a good book,I like this book because it was a good book and it had some unreal things in it.I also liked the way people in the story were and the parts they played.
4,Tuck Everlasting,"This book is great, sure it's really really long but its a exciting book it makes you never want to put it down. All ecxsept the ending of coarse! She never marries Jesse and she never drinks the water! So oveusly she dies and Tuck and Mae find her grave and she marries some other dude. So I'm rating this book a 4 because the ending stunk like cheese.No,no,no let me rephrase that it stunk like chicken. ya, you know I right. Because I think you read it.I'm the best at this review thing can't you tell.well I hope you like the book ecxsept the ending."
3,the story of life,"I enjoyed this book some what. My wonderfull reading teacher chose to read this book again, even though I read it last year. I think the idea of life for ever would be great. It remids me of a qute ... life is not forever, but death is. I think that this reminds me of the book because it is everlasting. Winnie was not my favorite character because she came from a perfect family and not everyone is perfect, there fore this makes my favorite character the man in the yellow suit. I love the authers way of writing all the details that she uses. The Idea of living for ever makes me think of all the tucks who will get to see the future."
2,Boring,Tuck Everlasting was ok. It's the type of book you have to be deep for. It's definetly not one of my favorite books.
4,Read the other kid's review,"Great book, enjoyed it immensely when I read it in Grade 6. But I have to say that the 11 year old kid's review (on this page) is one of the greatest book reviews I have ever read. Go on, take a look. You'll love it. I do disagree with him on giving it only 1 out of 5 stars, but I'm a girl so perhaps I like 'gooshy' books better."
5,Tuck Everlasting,This book is about a girl named Winnie. She finds a boy next to a magical spring. Now she has learned his secret and he takes her back to his home. A man watches this happens. Now he knows what happened. What will he do?
3,About Tuck Everlasting,Tuck Everlasting is a big cliffhanger. It's about a girl named Winnie who can never get away from her parents. One day she decides to run away into the woods. she meets a boy named Jesseand his family. They kidnapped her but they were friendly. They tell Winnie about this spring in the woods that Winnie thinks is magical but they don't. A man inthe yellow suit... you'll have to read the rest for yourself!
1,boy this book was not good never read nevert read this book,this book was good but i did not like it that much but i read itand if you are a book reader you would say this book stink .what i reconmend this book to a luttle kid how like to read book that are not that good.
1,Bad Book,I did not enjoy this book. I thought it was boring and not well writen at some points. The part of this book that I liked was the end because Winnie died and I didn't like her.
2,A Stupid And Pointless Book,"I hated this book. I do read day and night and i do love most books but not this one. The begining didn't grab me the middle was so-so and the epilouge and last chapeter was boring and stupid. Did i mention pointless? i gave it 2 stars since the middle was OK and since most people liked it. if you want a disapointing book, then this is the book for you."
3,Not So Great,The author didn't have much detail. I read this book for an assingment and I fell asleep. I wish there was more excitement. My grand ma had intrest in the story.But it was so boring I threw it away .It takes too long to Finish the book.If you liked the book something is wrong with you!
1,A STINKY BOOK BY SAM * CHRIS,I like this book it is good!!!!!NOT!!!!!!IT TALKS ABOUT THE CIRCLE OF LIFE......(IT'S VERY BORING)
3,A review from an adult,"This is a good story, but I think there's a major flaw. She worries intensely about Mrs. Tuck going to the gallows, because Mrs. Tuck can't die. Then, right after the toad she's fond of almost gets attacked by a dog, she dumps the spring water all over the toad. I finished the book last night and I'm still worried about the toad."
4,Immortal Love,"No one can resist a magical fountain that has powers to let you live forever. This is a great book that you won't be able to put down. It will pull you in and make you feel as if you were one of the characters. The story is full of twists and turns, murder, chases, evil characters, and even a love story. Grab the book, get a hot drink and a secluded place to sit in (a tree house would be great!) and prepare for an adventure you'll never forget."
3,Short n sweet,"I don't like long books, so I was into it from the start. I liked it more toward the end when it got exciting. I was sad too."
2,A good book for children! (under the age of 8),"It would be a GGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGreat book for children that like fairytale adventures.Some people would like it better than me because I am not into love fairytales,I like action fairy tales wwwwwwwwwwwwway better!One part in the book that sounded pretty cool when they think Mae Tuck is going to the gallows!Jacob 5th Grade"
5,Great!,"I like it when the order is exactly what I thought I was ordering. This was it. So, I'm happy. :)"
4,Tuck Everlasting,"This story is about a girl who is scared to leave the yard. She met a toad at the end of the gate. The toad then jump in the wood. The girl decided to go in the wood the next day. When she went to the wood she met a young man in the wood. They heard some elf music coming to them. The lady took the girl to there cabin, the cabin was a mess. Now you can find out the endingThis is a very good book for your children. They probably would like this book, you might too. I liked the part when they jumped in the lake. This is why you should buy this book. I now I liked this book."
2,Tuck Everlasting is an okay book,I read the book Tuck Everlasting by Natalie Babbit.I thought it was okay.There was some parts I did like and some parts I did not like.I mostley did not like it.I would give it 2 stars.I did not like it that much because there is really no such thingas the spring and how it will help you stay young forever.Tuck Everlasting is mostley about a girl named Winnie and she hears about the spring.She also hears that the spring will keep you young forever.I would recomend this book to someone who likes books with adventures in them.
5,Best Book In The World,"This book, Tuck Everlasting, by Natalie Babbit, is an enchanting book of adventure and a little bit of romance.Tuck Everlasting is about a girl named Winnie Foster and a family named Tuck. Winnie decides that she wants to run away, She runs away into her woods and sees Jesse Tuck drinking from a spring. Then suddenly gets swept off her feet and taken to the Tucks cabin and get told a secret that will change her life forever. What she would've chose at first is'nt what she chooses last.It is A wonderful book and can be read by all ages. Natalie Babbit is a great writer and this book shows it."
4,Tuck Everlasting,"Tuck Everlasting Tuck Everlasting is a good book that is about a girl named Winnie, Mea, Angus, Jesse, and Miles. Winnie is a 11 year old girl that cannot go outside her house. No one ever comes near the house. To the other people the house is just saying "" Move on-we don't want you here."" There is a guy in a yellow suit looking around there house looking for the Tucks. Winnie does not like staying in the house so she escapes into the woods. While she is running she finds this boy sitting there drinking from a tree. She asks if she could have a drink and he says no. The boy starts chasing her she tried to run away but he caught her. He takes her to his house to meet his parents and she stays there for a while. Until one day this guy in a yellow suit showed up at there house and says he will sell there secret. So Mae the mom knocks him out with a shotgun. I don't want to ruin the story so you will have to read the book and find out."
3,The ending stinks!!!!!!!!!!,"The book Tuck Everlasting was good but the ending stunk!!!!!! I hate it how they write these books with a crummy ending just leaving you hanging. Winnie should have drank the water and married Jesse. But I did like how she went in Maes place in the jail. And at the end , that toad was probably Winnies Toad and it will live forever!!!!!"
2,bad,"I thought that this book was corny. In fact, i thought it sucked. Don't buy this book, it's one of the worst in the history of mankind. Bad ending, bad beginning, bad middle, bad book. I hated it. The wheel was annoying how it kept coming up, and I hate how we have to read it for school. Natalie babbit's purpose of writing this book was to torture kids like me, and make us want to burn it. DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!!! IT SUCKS!!! i repeat DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!!!"
1,Fairly bad,Tuck Everlasting is a fairly pointless book about a girl named winnie foster. She gets kidnapped and is taught about being imortal and life.Overall it is boring and has no point at all. Although Natalie Babbitt is a fairly good author I would not recomend this book.
3,School Book,"Great story about Tuck, it was a school project and has to read to a paper. I loved the book and and the story behind it."
2,A book about Friends,"The main character of the book is winnie. winnie makes friends named Tuck, Mae, Jesse, and Miles.She was put in difficult situations like been kid napped. She made tough choses ,such as helping Mae escape. She learned that not everyone is nice like the man in the yellow suit. She also learned that her family loved her no matter what.I think the book was ok. It was ok because I like to read about friends."
3,Intresting in it's own sense,"In my opinion the book is a short sweet novel that is a bit slowmoving at times but picks up at certain places. If your looking for an action packed adventure than this wouldn't be yours. In my opinion the ""Romance"" in the novel was hardly described, and the main action point was only towards the end. Overall this book is pretty good but nothing but that."
5,a 12 year old girl,"i found this book very intriguing i read it all in two hours i loved it was one of the very best books i have ever read ! i even cried at the very end and i dont know why exactly ! this book is everything in one a romance,adventure,and a mystery in a way !!! i definetly reccomend this book to people of all ages! my mom read it !!!"
4,a good book,"I personaly, thought this book was very good. It might be confusing because more than one thing is going on at once. I read this book in my language class in sixth grade so it probably have been even better if I was not forced to read it. I hope you enjoy this book as much as I did!"
5,"An amazing, poignant book for all ages","In my humble opinion, Tuck Everlasting is one of the greatest children novels of all time. Although it is classically categorized as a book for children, and I've acknowledged is as such, I consider it deep enough and beautiful enough for all ages to enjoy. The tough questions it touches on, like immortality, human greed and death, and the non-condescending but beautiful way it goes about them is really touching and though-provoking, especially since the people of its target age audience are probably just beginning to think about those sorts of things. Babbit's imagery is wonderful, but not too ornate and doesn't take away from the story. The story flows simple and real, and the characters have so much depth you can picture them perfectly. The whole story, and the quiet but significant ending really touched me and made me cry and I read it for the first time at the age of 16. I suggest this book for all children able to read it, as well as their parents."
3,decent book with a lesson,"the book was okay. It was fantasy, but it was somewhat believable.The entire book was full of difficult decisions. Winnie had to decide between her ""proud"" boring family or immortality. the author makes any reader appreciate what it means to be a part of the cycle of life. Many people would like to be immortal, but the author points out every bad thing about it.not my type of book"
1,Review of Tuck Everlasting,I rate this book a 5. This is one of the best books i have ever read! The characters in this book were exstemely interesting! The plot of this book would catch your eye after reading the prologue! When i started to read this book i thought it was one of those boring school books that our teachers pick out cause they teach us an important lesson. AFter readind the first few chapters I never wanted to stop i started to read. Well i guess after reading this review you will be running to the library to read this book!
2,Satisfying yet dull,"The book is very good and a very cheerful read, but it is too packed with details. The story doesn't make sence in the middle. For example if Winnie liked Jesse, why ditch him? When you ignore the detail the story doesn't even make sence."
5,Tuck Everlasting -da best book that is everlasting,"critics call it the best ever block buster. to call tuck everlasting just a book seems like an insult. for it includes cycles of life,death,freedom, and the best ever description of time setttings and emotion tht never make it seem dull...EVER.even though it is an exellant book,everybook has its ups and downs. the book is very fast moving and only takes place in only a couple of days.natalie bebbitt see's to it thatthere isnt a moment without suspense. even though the story is great the stocharacterw aren't that good."
3,review of Tuck Everlasting,"Tuck Everlasting was a pretty good book it had a good plot,lots of rising action and falling action.Every thing about Tuck Everlasting has a reason,if something bad were to happen the Tucks would have a way out of it.The ending of Tuck Everlasting was very sad and discouraging."
4,Our review of Tuck Everlasting,"We are four fourth-grade students at Port Houston Elementary School in Houston Texas.Our names areYessennla Hernandez, Erik pena, Ramiro Sanchez and Jessica R. Tuttle.We read the book Tuck Everlasting together. We took turns reading the book and we took parts in a play. We all thought the book was very good .One of us thought it was the best book she had ever read and graded it A.Some of the characters in Tuck Everlasting were the members of the Tuck family, who had a secret power. They were Tuck and his wife Mae and their two sons named and Jesse. Another important character was Winnle Foster, a ten year old girl who made friends with the Tuck.At first the story sounded like it was going to be boring and difficult,but it becomes very exciting. There is a kidnapping and a murder and an escpe from jail.We all liked Tuck Everlast and we recommend it."
4,Saweet Book :0),"This book was a very great book! I loved how exciting it was. I would strongley suggest this story for any age. Its about a family who drinks majical water, and their worst feer is having any one find out about it. One day their worst nightmear comes true. Only this person is a 10 year old girl. Want to know more? Just read this book."
4,Well written,"How would you like to live forever like the Tuck's? This fearful mystery cannot be put down. The Tuck's Mae, Angus, Miles and Jesse are living forever, they couldn't die. Was it a good idea?Tuck Everlasting tells it all. Natalie Babbit, author of Knee Knock Rise tells a chilling, mysterious tale. It reeled in my attention not like any other book.I recommend Tuck Everlasting to 2nd grade and up because of the action and cliff hangers.You will remember Tuck Everlasting...FOREVER!"
3,Tuck Everlasting - Review,"This book is called 'Tuck Everlasting,' written by Natalie Babbit. I rated this book three stars.The characters in this book (the Tuck family and Winnie) are very realistic. Their personalities are individual, and probably easy to relate to.The plot in this book is that Winnie and the rest of the Tuck family work together to try to free Mae Tuck from prison, after she killed a man because of trying to save Winnie from practically being kidnapped.One of the only things I didnt't like about this book would have to be concerning the book's length. I thought that it could have been longer.I thought everything else about the book was okay."
4,Quality Literature,"After I read this book I was captivated. Natalie Babbit does a superb job of getting her readers inside the minds of Winnie and the Tucks. Besides obvious surface themes, there are many underlying themes that make for excellent discussion. The book is quite readable and the themes are not too intense for the target audience. The book does not contain foul launguage or inappropriate themes and is quite fit for classroom use. I student teach in January and plan to use it in my fifth grade classroom."
4,tuck everlasting,I found this book very good and thought provoking. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a short and easy read!
2,Not very good.,I thought the book wasnt very good because I had to read it in class and the reader that read it was really slow so i think thats why i didnt like it.I didnt like it because it didnt have alot of action.
5,A Magical Book!,"I rather rate it an 11 because I read it for Battle of the Books and I read it 4 times. It's about a girl named Winnie who's father owns a magnificent deal of land. In it, she finds a boy who is immortal and they become very good friends. This book is great for all age"
4,read tuck everlasting,"You should read Tuck Everlasting. First, it is very good. It has a very good plot with beginning, middle, and end. It has a nice start. At the beginning the book tells about both characters. It explains them very well. That is why I like Tuck Everlasting.It also has a good author named Natalie Babbitt. She even won an award for her book. It was the Newbery Medal. She also got complimented a lot about her book. It is very good. Everyone else in my class likes it too. Now, do you see all that great stuff about the author?Plus, reading is educational. You would be reading if you read Tuck Everlasting. Reading teaches you too, like in math books. It also helps your brain stay active. That is why you should read Tuck Everlasting."
3,Tuck Everlasting,"Tuck Everlasting was an ok book. I liked it in the beginning but then it started to get boring. I found that the book was boring because it did not have an interesting plot. Also the book went to slow for me. You should check this book out if you like romance and action books. I thought it was a ok book, but you have to check it out for yourself and see!"
4,Really Good book,This book is exellent book that I sugggest you read. It is about a girl who meets a family called the Tucks who live forever because they drink from the fountain of youth.
2,There'd be magic in this story if...,"There would be magic in this story if Mae hadn't hurt the man in the yellow suit. Even though she was trying to help Winnie, it ruined her character for me. There were a lot of loose ends, too. Who did Winnie marry? What did the Tucks do at the end? What happened to the man in the yellow suit? I dunno. I just didn't like it. There's just one moral: living forever would be awful. Its a really good point, but I thought the book was too ""one-minded""."
1,VERY BORING!!,It lacked excitement and did not keep my interest.When I am olderpossibly I may enjoy reading it.
3,12 year old kid,"The setting is Treegap. Winnie Foster wanted to runaway. Then there was a man in a yellow suit appeared at the Foster&#65533;s fence. He was talking to Winnie about the people around Treegap because he was looking for someone. Then Winnie&#65533;s grandmother came out and he told her he was looking for someone and, then they heard the Tuck&#65533;s music box and Winnie&#65533;s grandmother said it is elves but Winnie didn&#65533;t think it was. After the man in the yellow suit left and Winnie&#65533;s grandmother went inside, she went to the woods and saw the Tuck&#65533;s. They kidnapped her and took her to their little home.I think the story was good. It is a good book to read for kids and adults. I thought the first part was boring, but then it got fun to read. I like the part where kidnapped Winnie."
3,Everlasting Book,We gave 3 stars to Tuck Everlasting because the book made you imagine what was going on.But we didn't like how Natalie Babbitt didn't give us enough information to make the story more interesting.Overall the book was good and we recommend it for other people to read.
4,A Tuck Everlasting Reveiw,I thougth Tuck Everlasting was a fairly good book. It had a lot of words that told you what a place looks like. It also explained a lot about how the characters personality was. It had words that made you think of your own picture in your head. When you read the first few pages of the book you will think it is going to be boring but it gets pretty exciting after the first few pages. I wouls recommend this bokk to all ages.
3,forever everlasting,"After reading this book, I didn't like it so much. It has magic, death, mystery, etc. It's a combination of a lot of themes. One reason I didn't like it is because it had too many cliff hangers, so it had too many questions. It's about a girl named Winnie who goes to a forest, meets a boy, gets kidnapped by the boy's mom and bro, and then tell her a world changing secret. If you want to hear the rest you'll have to put your nose in the book and start reading!Goodbye! :)"
5,Tuck Everlasing,"Tuck Everlasting by Natalie Babbit is the most extraordinary book I've ever read. In the book the Tucks' Family drinks from a Foutain of Youth, that makes you live forever, the same way. A little girl named Winnie finds out about the fountain, because her family owns those woods. The big question of the book is, ""Will Winnie drink the water?"" I can't anwser that for you, but I will tell you this, a lot of interesting things in this book make you change the way you look at life. I cherished reading this bo ok. The author connects almost everything with a ferris wheel. The authors point is, living forever is a thing to think about,and this little girl has the chance to live forever. What do you think is her decision? This book is terrific from start to the very end.."
4,"Not the best I've ever read, but good none the less.","Tuck Everlasting was a great book. The discription was fantastic,the auther (Natalie Babbit) used similes, metaphors and personification in almost every sentence! For example: ""The sky was a ragged blaze of red and pink and orange, and its double trembled on the surface of the pond like paint spilled from a paintbox."" I found her writing very poetic, and I loved the story line. You don't see the idea of immortality much in books, and I loved how the Tucks actually understood how crucial it was not to let everyone know about the spring; they knew how disasterous that could be. You might be wondering why I gave this story four stars if I liked it so much, why not five? Well, I found the novel interesting, but not captivating. I wasn't pulled along, I didn't have the urge to read on, going at a slow pace was fine with me. I reccomend this book to people who like discriptive writing, and to those who like their books to move at a slow pace."
1,The worst book ever,"One star is absolutely way too many. I TRIED to read this book before the movie came out, because so many of my friends said they loved it when they were growing up. It was no doubt the most depressing, suicidal, the world is ending, type of book that I have ever read. I read a lot and I have to say I don't know where the acclaim came from. To tell you the truth, I was averaging 10 pages a day on this one, and that's about a minute a day, because it was so terrible. This is the first book that I did not finish. Never, never open it please, for your sanity and mine."
4,"Not very comfortable, but a good looking shoe","If you are planning to walk long distances with those, don't buy them. They are heavy and not comfortable to walk in. Other than that, a very nice and good-material shoe."
3,"Some great singing, but this Don has a steel spine","The timing for this recording couldn't have been better vocally speaking: Samuel Ramey was ascending as an eminent Don with the best bass voice for the role since Siepi, and the rest of Karajan's cast, except for the Don Ottavio, is first-rate. So why does this feel like an over-disciplined conductor's show, with almost no humor or humanity? Karajan was capable of much better, yet somehow both this and his Decca Figaro feel steely and impersonal, despite all the musical skill being applied. If others admire the technical accomplishment, I can't disagree. It's just a feeling thing."
5,Unbelievable,"I have a long playlist I like to come back to of Alt Country-or whatever you want to call it folks-artists I have accumulated over the years but no artist has me coming back to her music as often as Patty Griffin's.The production quality is great and relatively unadorned which I love. I really feel the lyrics the way they are supposed to be felt. To bad mainstream radio won't likely play her music cuz it doesn't have the word margaritaville anywhere in the lyrics.Patty, you just keep on keepin' on! :-)"
2,Too much guitar banging,"I found this CD disappointing. The lyrical, melodic qualities that I love about her music is missing in this CD. It has too much loud guitar banging. I was very disappointed. I would like to see her go back to her style from 1000 Kisses and her earlier works."
5,Biofreeze,"My wife has MS, and she experiences a lot of pain for which she takes handfuls of medicine. This is one product that also helps to give relief. It used to be hard to find (only find a medical supply, etc.), but I found it through Amazon!"
3,The Long Boom is only one scenario,"I'm a big Schwartz fan from ""Art of The Long View"". That being the case, I was disappointed to see that he didn't take his own advice in structuring the content of ""The Long Boom"". ""The Long View"" stressed developing best, worst and most likely scenariois to develop plans of actions to deal with future events. ""The Long Boom"" from my perspective dwells only on the best case scenario. Environmental and social issues are addressed, but the scenario is too tidy to believe. The strength of the book revolves around the explanation of ground-breaking technologies on the horizon. I think the integration of these technologies are very plausible, but remain to be seen. The book is definitely worth a read."
1,ho hum,"I really tried to like this book, but I could not connect with any of the main characters and there didn't seem to be much of a plot."
1,not good,I am going to have to agree with the others. This is not what Iexpected. None one this was new material. I had seen it all before and it was not funny the first time.
4,Great Value,"I borrowed the 26mm model from a friend and tried it out in my scope and loved it. Sure, it has a fishbowl effect at the edges, but I don't use the edge of the field anyway.I have a 16"" f/6.4 and the coma produced is not as bad as it might be in a shorter focal length scope, but for me, it didn't affect my observations of over a dozen faint galaxies that night. The center correction makes up for the edge.Since then, I've obtained a set of the Orion Q-70 series, which are almost identical, and I'd give them a five star over the four stars I'm giving the Meade version because their edges are a little less distorted.I'd go for these over a Nagler any day, as there are fewer elements the light has to go through and I don't really care if the field is flat all the way to the edge. And don't get me started on price! But that's just me. Highly recommended."
2,where does it say clean version?,"Like the band and like most of the music, one thing I hate the most is when you purchasse a CD and find out that its the clean version. This is on thing that I have come to expect with wal-mart, but didn't know I had to worry about amazon. Other then that love all songs that don't have swearing there is nothing like a made up word or sound that you know is not suppost to be there, to piss you off."
5,A picture book of glazes!,"A great book to have if you want to embark on the journey of making your own glazes. This book is so useful because there are pictures of test tiles of the glazes at alkaline, lead, oxidation, and reduction firings. Included in the pictures are tests of increasing strengths of oxides added to the base glaze recipes. Nine oxides, four glaze stains, and three opacifiers produce a broad range of color. Includes some raku examples as well."
5,The Potter's Palette Rocks!,"Beautiful, clear test-tile images are arranged by colorant, firing temperature and atmosphere. Gives a very good sense of the characteristics and uses of the materials found in a typical glaze lab. The Potter's Palette won't solve your glaze problems (there are plenty of books that address crawling, pinholing, etc) but it's uniquely instructive and very inspirational. For the intermediate to advanced potter."
4,Covers the roots of Lucas & Star Wars,"This is a good book, but it could be updated. The book is fairly thorough in detailing the early career, ambitions, problems and plights of George Lucas from the time of his birth to the time of making Return of the Jedi. This includes some discussion of THX1138 and American Grafitti. Even the updated version, however, stops there. There is no substantial discussion of any of the new prequels in this book. Yet that summarizes the book's scope and major limitations. That aside, readers will find themselves well-informed about the roots of Lucas, the genesis of Star Wars, and how the dream of the first trilogy unfolded and played out on screen. Obviously this book is not the last word on Lucas, but it is not a bad place to start learning about him"
5,A must-read,"I first bought this book in 1983 and have read it hundreds of times. I was initially disappointed in the 1990 ""update"" (which contained only a new Foreword) but that changed with the newest version of this book. It's too bad George Lucas dismisses it as being ""as accurate as the National Enquirer"" because for someone who hung out on the set of ""Return of the Jedi"" and conducted interviews with Lucas himself, Pollack delivers a highly interesting account of Lucas' life."
3,"Interesting, but there is... a ... better... Skywalker...","I read the older edition and loved it, but the ""revised"" edition is lacking. I believe that the more accurate, and far more interesting tale is spun in the recent book Droidmaker: George Lucas and the Digital Revolution. That book has a technical edge that Skywalking does not (both good and bad news, I suppose), Droidmaker smacks of deeper truths and less sensationalistic noise. Skywalking covers Lucas' youth very well, and stories of the production of his early films, but I don't think it's really that good a book. I suppose it's a must-have for the fan, but take that with a grain of salt. There are better and more current books now available -- in particular, Hearn's Cinema of George Lucas and Rubin's Droidmaker."
4,Pudo estar mejor,Me encanto este DVD aunque insisto esta compania Xenon deberia poner los capitulos en orden y por ano y hacerlos como lo hacen con las series en ingles; ponerlas por temporadas completitas.
4,So disappointed! 'House of Eliot',"I have had this collection in VHS for years and then reordered it in DVD for clearer viewing.I had forgotten that this story leaves you hanging without an answer to what happens toeveryone..........! I just stops! It is a wonderful story, so English. I'm wondering if there will everbe an collection to let usknow what happens with each character in the story. I do love seeing all the costumes of the 20's! Beautiful! Too bad, they have spent all the time and money to make this story and not to havefinished it for all the people that have purchased it at the high price that they sell it for."
2,volume not loud enough,"I gave it as a gift to an elderly person, and they could not hear it. The volume would not go very loud.Too bad as I think it is a good story."
5,Nice and sharp,"Good quality and sharp, teeth well cut, deep and consistent.Fairly course but that is what I wanted.The quality is miles ahead of the cheap Chinese ones I had before."
5,More exhilarating than Chariots of Fire,This is a movie worth seeing. The photography and the sailing sequences are phenomenal. THe movie takes you off the edge of your seat and onto the screen.
5,FINALLY..... IT'S AVAILABLE!,"I just received a message from Amazon.com that ""Wind"" is being released on DVD. I am hopeful that the video and audio transfer brings even more magic (not that it's needed) to an already great film. I have been trying to ascertain what the ""hook"" to this movie is for me, and I would guess it boils down to this: 1. A fairly believable love story 2. Great sailing action and camera work to bring back the rush of my sailing days 3. Excellent casting and character matching.Please do yourself a favor and at least rent this movie when it becomes available, and you just may end up putting it in your collection permanently."
4,One of my favorite movies.,I have always loved sailing . The movie didn't make a big splash when first released but the story and characters make for a good movie.
4,Outstanding Cinematography,"This movie will capture the hearts of all sailors. The filming of the race sequences are remarkable. While those technically proficient in the sport may notice a few weak spots, it superbly documents the thrills and excitement of a race. A must see! Especially as this year begins with the 2000 America's Cup races. PLEASE PUT ON DVD!"
5,great movie! pretty elizabeth taylor! Had read about this movie and just wanted to see it for myself. it was really good,had heard of this movie and just wanted to see it for myself. elizabeth taylor was very pretty evern at a young age. thanks
3,"Great toy, but small!","My son loves this toy, but I found it to be smaller than I expected! Pretty good quality and sturdy!"
4,adorable!,"We bought this checker set for our 4 yr old Care Bear lover- and so far none of the adults in our family have figured out how to really play checkers with it. But, the pieces are so cute that we don't care. We let the kids play it their way, and they love the little Care Bear pieces. I do feel silly after reading the other reviews that we haven't played checkers with it because apparently other parents can figure it out. I agree with the reviewer that said maybe you won't want it if you really want to play checkers. It seems hard to tell which squares are which. Otherwise, lots of fun!"
2,More a pamphlet than a book!,"WARNING: This is not a collection of stories as several reviews mention, but a single short story. There are no illustrations. This is more of a pamphlet than a book, and while the story is great, the product is *not* worth the money. There are much better Lovecraft compilations if you do your homework (which sadly, I failed to do here not noting there are only 36 pages)."
5,Awesome! Something for everyone...,"This is my absolute favorite Christmas cd! Now I don't have to wait until the holiday season to hear all of my favorite songs:) Offering is a phenomenal band and they've put a new spin on a lot of traditional carols! You're gonna love ""God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen"" and all of the other songs just as much as I do... I promise!"
3,Not my favorite interpretation of Beethoven,"I have listened only to Gilels' recording of Les Adieux, which I am in the process of preparing for performance. To me, it lacked warmth. Of course, technically it was impressive."
3,Its a little too easy,"I certainly do not have great balance (I also bought and extreme balance board and that is really hard for me). Even with one foot I mastered this board within a couple of days. I think the bottom interface with the floor is too broad relative to other wobble boards. I am going to try the fitter first product because it looks a bit more difficult.Also, the rough surface of this product is hard on you hands if you want to do push-ups on it or other upper body balance exercises"
5,Theraband Wobble Board,"Excellent wobble board to help train balance. Very sturdy and comfortable. Only thing is that I would have preferred if it was slightly larger. However, I would definitely recommend this product."
3,Not Challenging Enough for My Needs,I purchased this to help with my balance outside of physical therapy. I had ankle surgery and I need a wobble board that will continue to challenge me as I progress. I tried the board once and found it too easy for my needs. I am returning and purchasing one that allows you to adjust the degrees.I think this wobble board would be just fine for someone looking to improve balance but not for ankle rehab. The board is well made and appears will hold up over time. This is just my opinion and I was torn returning it because I love theraband products.
3,"1 good, 2 bad","Let's review disc one first. This a familiar theme in the style of Candid Camera, except with naked girls in the set up. For those of you who are fans of Janelle from Sunset Tan, you'll see a lot more of her here. Good for a few laughs and the girls are all pretty hot.And now for disc two. Well someone's nanna censored this one. I am not sure why you would pixelate every shot below the waist when the whole premise is naked girls in humerous situations - the only one who gets to see anything is the mark. No fun at all but OK if you want to watch with the whole family, including nanna. Ask for a 50% discount."
2,How Beautiful Women could get beaten to a pulp,"I thought this would be funny in an R rated Hidden Camera show way.There are some funny moments but there are mostly entrapment set ups, enticing the victim into the possibility of intimacy and at the last moment the victim is given a cold shower of reality by revealing it is a TV show and his girlfriend could be watching this.If I were in the situation of these people, I would feel like taking some swings at the girls and then move onto the producers.I would like to see some of the ones they didn't show who would have probably gotten extremely angry."
1,Longish and boring,How many times have we readers been confronted with this boring pattern: the dead body of a young woman found in the night ... and 482 pages later finally we get to know who killed her. Something ideal for the insomniacs! There are many more original thrillers on the market.
2,Slow & Wordy - Not Worth the Time,"This book is way too wordy - passages that could take one or two sentences to set up are given a longer paragraph. The storyline is predictable, and the characters not deep. The storyline takes too long to develop - I was tempted to toss the book about 1/3 of the way through, but buy the time I got half way the book finally got my interest. As an American reading the book, I found several English words/phrases that I didn't understand. I picked this book up in an airport bookstore thinking that anything that they would carry would have to be good, but I was wrong."
5,One of the decades finest mystery writers!,"I got ""hooked"" on Val McDermid after watching ""Wire in the Blood,"" a detective series on BBC about a psychologist who profiles for the British police. McDermid has written an excellent series of books about the two characters, Dr. Tony Hill and Chief Inspector Carol Jordan. However, The Distant Echo is one of McDermid's finest novels, in my opinion, and does not involve these characters. The story is about four teenagers who are accused of raping and murdering a young girl. They are never convicted of the crime, but its horror insinuates itself into each of their lives in insidious and unique ways. The characterizations are incredibly well done; the writing is phenomenal; and the plot kept me completely engrossed, night after night. I didn't want it to end."
3,Good writing but w-a-y too long,"This is the 1st book I've read by this author who is obviously a good writer. Her characterizations of the boys and descriptions of their conversations were excellent. But where was her editor? Why did this book need to be almost 400 pages long? There was too much repitition (the particulars of the crime must have been repeated a thousand times--ok, ok, we know what happened); too much minute detailing of events (the various attacks on the boys by Rosie's brothers are described in excrutiating detail and take up too many pages); too many long digressions for unimportant side issues and events (the birth of Alex's baby was gone over in lengthy detail)."
3,Oddly entertaining,"This murder mystery has a Scottish accent. Four university men are caught up in the homicide of a bar maid. Some twists and turns are predictable and some are not - none are annoying or insulting.The story is well told and not disjointed. I was able to read the story in bits and pieces over several days without getting lost.My only criticism is when the author becomes confused regarding the sleep patterns of a character. One specific night he is ""feeling as if he had been asleep for minutes instead of hours"" (p. 253) and then when describing a period of time taht was included the earlier description the character has ""slept more deeply than he had since childhood"" (p. 268.) Silly.Well, I guessed ""who done it"" . . . before the end, but that's okay.I will add author Val McDermid to my reading list.Three stars."
5,Val McDermid is a Master Storyteller,"Ms. McDermid has delivered another taut and intelligent mystery for her legions of devoted fans, which I count myself a proud member.I will leave it to others to give a plot and character overview, but believe a reader new to her work will be drawn to how well she constructs her plots and characters. Also, she's very fair in how she places clues in the story for those of us who like to work out the ""who done it"" before the final exposition.If you are looking for a book to burn the midnight lamp over, this will keep you engrossed.My only criticism was a minor character (deviant, bad guy)was named Brian !!"
2,gambling expert?,"It bothers me that a gambling expert doesn't do numbers. I would think numbers are one of the most important aspects of the field. Here we have a guy saying that casino dice are perfect 1"" cubes when they are really more like 19mm (.75""), and that if one of the sides is shaved by even ""fifteen hundredths of an inch"", it won't roll fairly. Duh. That is a HUGE difference, like one of your eyes is less than 7/8 the size of the other. You would look like Alfred E. Neumann. I can't stand fiction by ""experts"" that don't give crap about details."
5,An industry standard,"Channellock makes a wide variety of hand tools but the company's name has become synonymous with their tongue and groove pliers. Any tradesman will immediately know what you mean when you say ""pass me the channellocks"". The 430's easily handle almost anything up to about 2"". A pair of the smaller 420's coupled will a pair of these pliers will cover almost all of your needs for a ""pair of channellocks""."
4,A very interesting and competent introduction...,"I am not a professional mathematician. Nonetheless, I enjoyed and understood most of this book. I learned some new facts, and appreciated the author's gentle writing. (For instance, I learned what a ""transcendental irrational number"" is.) I think an interested high school student could read this book and gain a lot from it.My only wish is that the author would have published the solutions to problems in an Appendix. To a professional mathematician or a graduate student, I am sure the problems and proofs would be easy, but I would have gained a lot from being able to see how the problems could be solved.So, overall, I really enjoyed this and hope that I can find other books like this in math."
1,Yeah...I'm gonna have to go ahead and disagree.,"Admittedly, I don't scour the surface of the Earth for hard to find B, C, and D-class tracks to add to my metal collection. If you do, you may agree with the novelist who wrote the first review on this set. As for me, this is one of those items that you just have to admit to yourself was a mistake and file it with sanitation engineering. Luckily, I got mine on clearance."
4,A Great Dark Fantasy,"Perdido Street Station is a marvelous dark fantasy, full of marvel and invention. It's set in a world -- in a city -- populated by a mixture of humans and non-humans. Some of the non-humans are nearly human -- cactus people, people with heads like scarab beetles, and so on. Others are incredibly alien, particularly the Weaver, a wonderful spider-like being.The book is full of the types of scenes that will stick with you forever. The characters are well drawn, but, with a few exceptions, they pale beside the incredible world around them.The book does have its flaws. It takes 150 pages before the true plot of the book emerges. And a key scene near the end features a real deus ex machina conclusion (particularly annoying because the author did not need to handle the scene this way). But these flaws are minor compared to the rich, engaging tapestry of Perdido Street Station."
4,Very different!,"Please have a dictionary handy or use your kindle as this book is written with very obscure words throughout the book. I liked the story which had many twists and turns and didn't follow a predictable formula. Had me laughing out loud at some points in the book which my friends found strange, but I have a dark sense of humour."
4,Better than The Scar? Maybe...,"I first ran into China by reading 'The Scar' and was impressed with the book but did have a couple issues with it as posted here. Reading the praise for Pedido Street Station I decided to pick it up, and I'm happy I did.But again, there are issues. If you think Tolkien over complicates descriptions of objects or scenes, don't even open these books, the prose may be over-the-top for some 'less patient' readers. Also, as another reviewer mentioned, maybe China should put down the thesaurus and use 'normal' words. The use of solipsistic, puissant, and other uncommon words seem overused, and even more so in The Scar. While I don't mind learning new words, it can be combursome to break open Dictonary.com just to learn that Puissant means power; might. Maybe look at it like a vocabulary trainer...All in all, the world building and characterization is top notch. I recommend reading it, not as challenging as The Scar, but I believe a better book."
3,Brilliantly average,"It started with a bang, and it was inspired reading for awhile. Great imagery, bizarre and interesting characters, in a cool setting. Very gradually, without really noticing it, I started to slow down my reading pace and take frequent breaks. Then I realized it had become tedious, at about the point where I settled into a monster hunt story. For me, the book never recovered from that eventual one-track theme, and the awareness of reading a long book took over. The slake-moths seemed to have attacked the book itself, not just the many different characters, taking the life out of it. It left me with a feeling of what could have been, unfortunately."
3,"Tantalizing, slow, rich, and ... Too easy to put down.","I adored the savory and creative juices which flow through the pages. There is a richness here, of imagination and description. Alleys felt stinky and frightening, creatures opened up in 3D in my mind. But the story just didn't move enough for me. I yearned for more suspense, more action, and a faster pace. Ultimately, I bogged down and could go no further.This novel had great appeal for me--I'm not much of a ""fantasy"" genre reader, but this novel has enough urban-American sensibility to feel accesible to me. It's almost ""speculative"" fiction, as Margaret Atwood calls it.I am deeply intrigued by this introduction to China Mieville, but I can't quite recommend this book to people outside of the traditional fantasy audience."
2,"Having a hard time getting into this, may not finish","While I can see that the author is a skilled writer and much of this is very imaginative, I am having a hard time substaining interest. The book's 710 page length is probably a warning sign. After 100 pages, the reader had better be caught--well, I'm still not caught! May slug on for a while longer. Again, while the writer is very skillful, if ever a book cried out for a good editing, this one does. It's simply too long and does drag. Squalor and decay get tiresome. A pity so few editors really edit books any longer; it often shows as with Perdido Street Station."
2,Desperately needs a good editor,"His style is painfully long-winded. Excruciatingly so! If you don't start skimming towards the latter quarter of the book, desperately wanting to be done with it so that you can spend your time on better things, then you are a stronger person than I.It is unfortunate that what the author set out to create could have been a great work of fiction if only it had been half the length."
3,"Steampunk, Fantasy, Horror","I think there is too much in this book. There are to many races. To Much death. To many elements. China Miéville writes well. The town and description are wonderful. The villains are ""Scary"", but I felt awash in the strangeness and death of the book. After a while you just have to say they are a strange group, and stop caring. You have to find a connection. I thought I did a few times, but the massive differences pushed me back out."
1,I'm obviously not the intended audience,"Yet another urban grunge fantasy. Been there, done that. Yet more wierd aliens and hybrid people, ALL of which think and behave EXACTLY like ordinary humans, so what is the point? The highest technology is steam engines, yet we are expected to believe they have powered flight and the medical ability to graft absolutely anything onto the body. Sorry, I couldn't buy into it. Maybe I am just burned out on fantasy science fiction, although I had no trouble recently re-reading Lord of the Rings and loving it."
2,1 and a half stars,I just could not get into this book. The characters were not very interesting. The actual city was somewhat interesting but that wasn't enough for me.
4,Good Story,"Niobia Bryant has a great future ahead of her, this was a good story, I enjoyed it very much, read it in one night."
