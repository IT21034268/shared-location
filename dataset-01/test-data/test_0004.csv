5,A Good Nickelodeon Show,"I really liked this film and my favorite part is the Thug Tug scene. I also like the song that was used in the Trench scene which is known as ""Now That We're Men."" Hope the sequel to this film that comes out in the future is as good as this movie."
3,Sometimes EXTREME ignorance can be charming!,"I am a big fan of the TV series; unfortunately, the movie is not nearly as entertaining to me. If you enjoyed ""An Extremely Goofy Movie"" or maybe ""The Care Bears Movie"" then you might want to chance it, but if you're expecting the TV show forget it. The most interesting thing about this movie to me is that it drew someone like p kitts out from under whatever rock he/she was hiding. Word creations like ""lagh"" (used 5 times), ""houp"" for ""hope,"" ""seen"" for ""scene,"" and ""though"" for ""tough,"" when teamed with expressions such as ""i seen it 2 times,"" etc., are funnier than anything in ""The Spongebob Squarepants Movie""! Just funny, funny stuff! And I don't mean any disrespect, honestly. I just wish the movie had entertained me as much as that review!"
2,Not Very Funny,"I am a Spongebob fan, but this movie was SO corny and drawn out. There were exactly 2 or 3 funny parts. This should've been either a made for TV movie or gone straight to video and DVD."
5,I'm in love with Spongebob!,Me & my pals on Spongezone fourms &Spongebuddyfourms can't wait for this movie!It is gonna be great!
3,Gosh darn it!,"OK, Im not going to tell you this movie was the greatest I have seen or the best movie of the year, but gosh darn it I had a good time and laughed a lot. Some dont think this but the opening sequence is really shocking and funny (youll never see it coming),and ditto for the closing sequence. The jokes in the movie are a little more adult than on the show but all the better because I have grown out of the show a little since Nick stopped making new episodes. There were a few parts that when I saw them I thought, some kids are gonna be really scared. Some charecters from TV are hardly even seen, but I went for the comedy, not for the charecters. The creators did a really good job of turning a 20 minute (without comercials) TV show into a 90 minute film. In fact they did it so well that I think you would enjoy it more if you had never seen the show. So go out there, see it, dont be afraid to laugh, and gosh darn it have some fun!"
4,where the heck was gary???,"This was just plain goofy fun. If you're a fan of the tv show you'll love it. I loved the pirates in this movie also. One thing that I am noticing though is when you go in Walmart there is a $5.00 price diff on the full screen version as opposed to widescreen. I noticed this on Shark Tale also. I don't like this trend, I think it's a ripoff in a way because they both should be the same price. I much prefer WS but FS is a lot cheaper. Oh well."
3,If you LOVE SpongeBob......,"I took my two children (girls 5 & 7) to see this movie today. The 5 year old loved it. The 7 year old and I couldn't wait to get out of the theatre. My observation is that if you already love SpongeBob, Patrick, et al., you are likely to enjoy the movie. Otherwise, this film is not likely to appeal to you.I doubt that this movie will win many new fans for SpongeBob. There were only a handfull of people in the theatre - at a matinee during winter break. The plot was not enticing, and the characters have one or two ""tricks"" that become tiresome quickly. The cast of characters, who may be fine in small doses for the casual fan, drove me crazy after a few scenes.One cute aspect were the scenes in which the cartoon characters ""interact"" with real people. Those actually caught my attention.So, if you feel confident that you really like Bob and crew, this movie may be a good choice for you. Otherwise, approach with caution."
5,Not enough jellyfishing!,"If you are reading this review, you are kind of sort of wasting the time you could be spending either ordering or watching this movie. It could cheer up the dead, if they weren't already buried. Try showing this to the next freshly-minted corpse you come by and watch them come right back from the abyss and do the Goofy Goober dance! It's a bit unnerving, and you have to put them back down with a bullet in the brain, but this movie is THAT good!"
2,Cute but.........COME ON!,"Yes yes, I know your thinking ""EVERYBODY LOVES SPONGEBOB!""And I do admit that it is funny and cute. But It is quite annoying. The show was fine. But a MOVIE?!? I would rather watch a 24/7 marathon of Telatubies! The only person in SpongeBob Squarepants that is even remotely funny is Patrick Star!And like every other movie based off of a show, when you return to the show, THEY ACT LIKE IT NEVER HAPPENED! Not to mention a lot of people are mad a Nick for canceling Invader Zim! So if you want to save yourself from brain damage, I recomend not seeing this movie.Trust me, that would be a wise choice."
3,Not as good a the TV show,"I liked it, and it did have it's moments but the TV show is so much better. I don't even think Sponge Bob laughed in this movie. Sponge Bob was sad and depressed thru the whole movie. It's just not the Sponge Bob that everyone loves which really hurts the movie. You will like this movie but it's not what you think it is."
4,15 minutes + 15 minutes + 15 minutes....,"Short animation always struggles to become feature length films. Sometimes it should just be avoided. Spongebob barely succeeds. If you are like me, a part of the cult of Bob, than you will love the new material. If you are expecting a brilliant fantasia animation move, well, er, Goofy Goober!"
4,for spongebob fanatics...,I like the movie... Spongebob is charlie brown's counterpart who just happens to live in a pineapple under the sea....
2,rent before considering buying,"I am disappointed in the movie. My advice would rent first to see if you truly want this one in your collection or rapidly repeatly watched over by the little ones.The movie had a few funny parts but off beat to the clean crazy humor the show is so loved for by adults and children. Some how seeing Patrick in a pair of net stockings and high heels sort of ruins the image of cool to dearly sad way of getting a laugh, if someone finds that funny. I find the rest of the movie following suit to a lower level of humor where I think they either were trying to hard that they missed the boat or maybe not trying hard enough that the boat is a sinking ship."
3,Toomuch,"The only thing is that the movie is $9.99, so it is a little to much for me.But otherwise, it is nice"
1,Hopelessly outdated,This book can only be of value for someone that is stuck in the seventies. All hints and advises regarding techniques to take pictures are so outdated to be considered useless.The illustrating pictures have this yellowish touch which defined that period of extraordinary bad taste.Definitely not worth a single cent.
2,bose wave radio,The reception has not been very good. I am disappointed.May be it will help to move it around.I hope so.
1,What a load of c***!,"I never read the book, but the CD is such a masterfully ""abridged"" version of the book that it manages to tell you for hour HOW WONDERFUL six sigma is, while totally neglecting to tell you WHAT SIX SIGMA ACTUALLY IS, or HOW IT IS IMPLEMENTED. In short, the CD contains nothing but self-marketing bull. If you have money to waste, go buy it."
1,Dont waste your time with this book!,"This book will tell you that six sigma is an excellent quality improvement program, (You probably heard this already) yet authors won't equip reader with the tools that six sigma offers. I read this book twice with a strong desire to understand the principles of the six sigma, but after reading it cover to cover twice I got nowhere.I like to read, and through the years I read a lot of books, but consider this to be the worst business book I read so far! Jack Welch, in his book Winning (which I strongly recommend) dedicates one short chapter to Six sigma, and it covers everything you will learn from this book. This book offers no substance what's so ever!!"
5,Love the case,I've had this case for a few months now and still love it. I used the bottom DVD slot for my DVD burner and used the top slot to wrap all the excess cables from the power supply. Keeps the inside of the case clean and simple with good air flow. I purchased a multi card reader with a USB 3.0 port to fit in the floppy slot. Added some ram with led's which lights up the case perfectly. Overall great case. No complaints.
3,Enjoyable,"Enjoyable, however, these stories are in all his other books, its is more like a compilation of every dog story from each book, which was a little disappointing. I had hoped for new stories."
5,Seeds Of Deception,"A wonderfully show telling the story of deception of a doctor praying on the lives of troubled women, fantastic acting"
1,Bob,"I ordered this item based on the five stars given by another purchaser. I have as yet to use it. I am basing this review on the quality of the piece.When shredding cabbage, one must realize that the cabbage will contain some moisture. There is no protective finish on this slicer to repel moisture or keep it in good order when cleaning with soap and water. Also, when I tried out the sliding box that holds the cabbage, there was an area that the box would not readily slide through. Upon further investigation I found the base of the slicer was warped, where two diagonally opposite sides were not on the same plane as the other two sides. In essence, it was a rocking horse.It seems to me that before this thing leaves the manufacturer, someone should be checking the product.Very poor workmanship and quality even though a close grained wood was used in its production.I am presently warping this thing in the opposite direction before I apply a clear epoxy paint finish."
1,matt,thought the product worked great... only problem had was first time was too small...second was that not happy with cost to ship...way overpriced
4,Good,"I like the shirt, nice compression, good sizing. The only problem was the advertise with long and short sleeve shirts depending on the colors, so i wasn't sure what i was going to get. Its was a SHORT SLEEVE."
4,"Great product, but enjoy the sleeveless better","Great product, but I enjoy the sleeveless versions better. These type of shirts, however, provide the exact protection I need to prevent raw nipples."
3,"Under Armour Heat Gear Full T-shirt, WHITE, LG",It was first compression T-Shirt and was unsure what to exspect. Should have gotton the bigger size
3,Eyebrow wax hair remover.,"This was first purchase of a wax eyebrow hair remover so I have nothing to compare it to.Strips are nicely shaped to remove hair from any area under brow. It could have used a little more ""sticking"" power.It failed to remove as much hair as I would have liked.Price was nice but delivered in smashed box. Vendor customer service was very good. I would try other of their productsbased on my experience with them."
1,You'd have better luck with scotch tape.,"Let me just say, these are awful. They don't take any hair with them, I've followed all directions properly and tried a whole sheet of them but none of them worked.Don't waste your time or money on this product."
2,not good,"the shape of these is so weird. no eyebrow has that shape. it's ok at removing hair. it has to be long for it to come completely of, doesn't work well on the little hairs"
3,Pipemaster OK but,"The pipemaster seems to work OK for the do-it-yourselfer. Someone who only does a few jobs every once in a while. If you will be using it a lot I recommend you upgrade to the pipemaster professionalProsIt is easy to use and works in tight spaces.ConsIt's designed to heat the pipe and not the fitting so you need to make sure the fitting is hot enough before soldering.The heads have no set screw so they can turn on you and have poor heat transfer.The jaws don't lock closed so and it can take a lot of squeezing to make a connection.Nice to knowFirst is it only comes with the 1/2"" pipe jaws. If you are doing any other size they are a separate order.If you are working with multiple sizes you will have to let it cool down to change heads.Hardware stores now carry a snap connector for copper pipe in T's, elbows, couplings etc. You just push the pipe into the fitting and it locks there water tight. The fittings are in the $5.00 each range."
1,Big waste of money (and space in my house!),"My 5 year old son wanted this so bad, but when we got it for him, there were so many pieces to put together that didn't fit together well, he never played with it. It just sits on our floor in many pieces taking up toy space! What a waste!"
5,Definitely and not maybe the best album ever,My first taste of Oasis was the Morning glory album which I loved very much. I was the greatest album I had ever heard. Up until then every album I owned seemed to have at least one bad song in it but not this one. However I was even more suprised when I bought this one. I couldn't believe how good it is. From the powerful opening of rock and roll star right through to married with children an amazing amount of energy flows through this album. Its got the raw energy of the sex pistols with the brilliant song writing of the beatles-the perfect combination. The only thing I can't understand is why only 8 million people bought this album. It should be 100 million.
2,Oasis Tries To Mimic Lennon Often On This Release,"Oasis' debut album ""Definitely Maybe"" is a fair start into the pop world, using symbolism, metaphors, guitar crunch and Lennon-esque high pitched vocals. ""Live Forever"", the breakout tune, gets annoying at times and the rest of the album gets lost. Oasis sounds like a Beatles cover band doing the lost songs of the late great John Lennon. Fair."
3,Why make a stereo only DualDisc?,"This is a very good album, especially for a debut, so I was excited to see a DualDisc, hoping for better sound quality than the original CD and also a 5.1 mix. Unfortunately, the DVD side is ""enhanced"" stereo, not a 5.1 mix. I REALLY wish Amazon would distinguish that in their detail pages. I have been burned twice now on discs that were SACD or DualDisc, and was expecting a surround sound version. Maybe this album just wasn't recorded or mixed that well to begin with, because even the ""enhanced"" stereo didn't sound that great and not much better than a standard CD. I have a decent two channel system and very good CD and pretty good DVD universal player. Not very impressed by the sound. If you love this album, probably worth the purchase...there is a good documentary included.Otherwise stick with the CD."
2,Hmmmm....is there a way to get a refund?,"I wanted to read some sci-fi, some high IQ stuff, some thought-provoking short stories I could read on the DART getting to and from work. Well, after reading all of these stories, I'm convinced that writers do not submit their prize stories for anthologies. They submit their scraps. That's craps with an extra S. I'm dissapointed. Maybe my expectations were too high. Perhaps if I lower my expectations to what one might expect if judging a suburban high school writing contest...hmmm...no, I'm still dissappointed. The people who put this together owe me $10 just for reading through it. If you read this then you should demand compensation. I am not better off after reading this anthology. Maybe I didn't do enough shrooms or hippie lettuce before reading it. :-("
1,DO NOT BUY!,"If you want to spend $53 for one tiny trash can then this is the deal for you. This product should have been sold as a 6 pack but unfortunately someone messed up when they entered this product for sale. Both Amazon and Geroy's deny responsibility for the error and to date nothing has been changed. It was REALLY disappointing to get this in the mail & then have to turn around and return it. ALSO, you can't return this product without talking with someone at the amazon call center. This purchase was a huge WASTE OF TIME and I'm disappointed that it's still available."
4,"Good...been done, but good.","This is an excellent disc. For those White Stripes fans out there, the Black Keys-White Stripes debate is not worth getting worked up over. The Black Keys are a much different band. And seriously, if you want the low-fi, raw blues sound, you should be listening to the Jon Spencer Blues Explosion. (Yes, music like this was recorded before 1999.) The Keys or the Stripes are good places to start, but check out JSBX and hear where this low-fi, raw sound really became modernized."
2,trying too hard,"i have a friend who loaned me a copy of this book and insisted i read it and spread the word... thank god i didn't spend money on it. the stories seem forced, almost like they were taken from real life experience and then re-told in such a way as to make them thoroughly unbelievable. i hope that the essays aren't all autobiographical, because they seem to come from a core of desperation that is just painful to read. this guy has potential but really needs to find his own voice and stop trying so hard... i might give his sophomore effort a try (if there is one) but i wouldn't waste the moolah on this one"
4,Beaded Moccasins,I THINK BEADED MOCCASINS IS A GREAT STORY FOR ADVENTURURES. THERE ARE SOME SAD PARTS. BUT WHEN YOU GET TO THE END IT WAS WORTH IT. THER WERE SOME PARTS WHERE I COULDN'T PUT THE BOOK DOWN.
1,"RUN!!!, RUN FAR AWAY!!!!","I bought the silver version and this product is junk. It is cheaply constructed and broke the instant I attempted to place my palm TX in it. The cheap plastic slide piece that attaches the PDA to the case would break in a stiff breeze. The neoprene lining lifts off in humid weather or whenever it feels like it. The memory card slots are a joke and the shoddy belt clip is the punch line. Without a doubt, the worst online purchase I have ever made."
2,I don't recommend it,"I bought the silver version of this case and was very disapointed. The belt clip is of such cheap construction that the case would easily fall off my belt. On the bright side, it protected my Palm from breaking, but I would have preferred it not to fall in the first place. The case also had a tendency to flip open while on my belt, causing the whole thing to pivot on its flimsy clip. I don't recommend this product."
5,survived china,"i have a palm tx just for studying chinese using plecodict software.. my pda wouldn't have survived my travels over summer w/o this case. excellent construction and durability, still looks brand new after 5 months of wear and tear. love it."
1,lose the belt clip!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I recently bought this product for my Palm TX and was equally disappointed as well as annoyed with the cheap belt clip. It isn't apparent in the photos, but there is a screw attached to the back of the case, which makes it impossible to lay flat. This I found extremely annoying. The clip (which you can take on and off) is extremely cheap and doesn't secure well. It flops and swirls around. Otherwise, the case would be fine. I do not recommend."
1,Does not fit,"The case looks really nice and seems well made. But I never used it because the case seems backward for my TX. While the TX fits well into it, I can't access the stylus or the ports for synching and charging. If I put it in backwards the stylus and ports are accessible but I can't see the screen when I open it."
2,Don't Bet On It,"Player 5150 is close to the top of my ""Eject Immediately"" heap of flicks.It's a wonder to me how a movie like this gets past a pitch meeting! Maybe an explanation is the lowering cost of actually making a movie - something excruciatingly evident in the low-budget look and feel here. A patchwork of cliche-rich dialog and awkward borrowing from other films, this DVD is barely watchable. NoPushover recommends not gambling on this one."
3,"Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow, creeps in...","No, the film isn't based on Shakespeare. More like Scorcese. Unknown (at least to me) actors doing a creditable job with a mediocre, predictable script, with all the usual gimmicks, but still produced a film which moved right along and will yield a glimpse of a world unlike ours...at least I HOPE so. Money finds its way down and up the pecking order with blood stained, bruised, and greedy fingers. Low life stereotypes of all kinds vie for thug of the night.Gambler/broker/daytrader lead was effective about 50% of the time and goofy the other 50%. Pretty woman ""Ali"" and main bad guy/cook make the most of their roles with only a touch of tongue in cheek.Rent it, don't buy it, so that YOU won't have to pay up tomorrow..."
5,is as advertised,I was originally worried this book would be paranoid or silly but it's full of history and practical tips. Highly recommend.
1,Don't buy ! There's no ISP for it,I owned many models of Mail Station & loved them from the years 1999-2006 but since then there are no ISP servicers for this gadget. It used to be owned by Earthlink whom was then bought out by Cidco and now there isn't anyone providing service to send/receive emails with this thing which is too bad since it was easy & fun and a way to communicate without the internet without spam or any advertizing. Whenever mailstation has a new provider ( doubtful ) I will purchase another 1 year contract as my gadget still functions it's just that I cannot connect without an ISP. Everyone whom owns this thing knows what I speak of; it's obsolete so why buy one ? ( If you read the disclaimer below it states they won't supply service to new customers ; so what is the point in buying this ? )
3,Good things and bad things..,"There's good things and bad things about this planner. I like how it's a binder style with dividers. But there aren't any tabs on the dividers so I had to add my own. It's nice because you can take out sections you don't need - like I'm not using a videographer so I just took that whole section out to make more room. I also like the CD-Rom that comes with it. Makes doing the guest list super easy. There also aren't any folders or anywhere to put loose papers with menu information, pictures, etc. so I just got those clear plastic page holders for all that stuff. Overall, it could use some tweaking, but generally the information and checklists are helpful."
1,This book is a waste of paper and ink.,This book is a waste of paper. It speaks in terms of generalities that are meaningless. The paragraphs are double spaced and the book is specific to the state of New York. I wouldn't wipe my you know what with the pages from the book. SAVE YOUR MONEY - DON'T BUY THIS BOOK!
1,Legal Mumbo Jumbo,"This is truthfully worthless books. I had counted at least 20 typos on this book. I also do not like the double space to make this book look volumnious which it is not. It is basically a flyer which is printed in the form of a book. The litigation only contains New York, and that is too outmoded. Truthfully, it was a waste of time and money to buy this book. It creates the impression that the doors to a very secretive knowledge would be open to you but the knowledge given in this book is very basic which I am sure any reader worth their salt attempting to venture into this territory might already knows. Truthfully, I was disappointed to read this book."
3,"Flimsy handle, but good file","This foot file is pretty good. I think the handle is too flimsy though. When you begin to use the file, the handle feels like it's going to break. So instead of holding it like the picture shows, I tend to hold it maybe 1/2 way down the file itself, to ensure it doesn't break while I'm using it."
2,Most boring book I've ever been forced to read,The title pretty much expresses my feelings about this book. It was incredibly boring. I purchased it because my professor required me to read it. It was literally hours of my life that I will never get back.Totally Lame.
3,Not bad,"This is a good book for basic ideas. Great for the beginning artist, but not recommended for someone a bit more advanced."
2,Jazzinho...what went wrong?,"I'm clueless as to what happened with Jazzinho's second album. I loved their first album. I waited months for this second album. I felt the songs were uninspired, and the arrangements odd.I hate writing this review, but this album was not my favorite. I didn't even like ""The Lagoon Monster"" which was one of the singles they released from this album. Very disappointed."
5,A dark chapter for witches of Hogwarts,"First read it in 8th grade about 20 years ago in reading class. The teacher was a blonde Jewish hottie about 5'6"""" in her early twenties named Miss Fee. The book is great by itself, but taught by a good looking teacher makes it even better."
1,NaST like a teST,I am in college now and i had to take a teST on this book when i was i the seventh grade. At that time i hated the book. i thought it was even more naST than Jhonny Tremain. i just wanted to make a mast on that book. it was so boring i just fell asleep. i would not reccomend this book to anyone and i would tell someone to read The Future of Us instead. i just fealt like making a naST in this book and putting it away so when the next person like juSTice reads it they would see my naST and think the book was naST. what a disappointment
3,Another Newbery,"Having read ""The Sign of the Beaver,"" I was looking forward to reading this book. I liked the book overall, and it ranks fairly high among the 80 Newbery books I've read, but I didn't enjoy it as much as I had hoped. It was, however, a relatively quick read.Set in pre-Revolutionary Connecticut, this story depicts the struggle between the colonists who wanted to remain loyal to the crown and the new breed of American who felt they deserved the freedom to be independent in a land they had carved out. It also touches upon the issue that every person faces at some point, do we accept people who are different than we are or do we brand them as outcasts?"
3,WHY,IT WAS AN OK OF A BOOK. IT WASN'T IN MY OPINION AS WELL AS THE INCREDIBLE JOURNEY. THAT IS WHY I ONLY GIVE IT THREE STARS
4,The Witch of Blackbird Pond,"The Witch of Blackbird Pond is a good historical-fiction book. This book is good if you wanted to learn more about colonial times like their: everyday chores,religous events,festivals,dress pattern etc. I liked this book because it's a real page turner, it makes you wonder what's going to happen next.As you read the book you'll find out that it turns out to be so un-predictable! By reading this book you could tell that Speare worked hard and put a lot of effort into writing The Witch of Blackbird Pond. Wether you're reading the Witch of Blackbird Pond for the first time or fifth time it will be an enjoyable experience!"
2,So long and dull,"I was forced to read this book in school, and although some parts were interesting, the rest was so boring. The ending is good but I struggled to get through the middle"
4,Our class recommends you read this good book.,"This story is about a young woman, Kit, whose parents died so she had to live with her relatives. Kit makes friends with a Quaker lady named Hannah who is thought to be a witch. Kit is accused of witchcraft because of her friendship with Hannah and she has to go on trial. Our class greatly enjoyed this book and recommends it to other students."
3,I liked this book and would...........,I really liked this book. I thought that it was very interesting and well put. I would recommend it. I liked all the characters. They all seemed realistic.
5,The Witch of Black Bird Pond,I still own my 1973 paperback edition of this book. It's one of the first novel I ever purchased; and it is tattered at the corners from being re-read. I find something new and delightfull every time I read it.Thank you Elizabeth for many hours of retreat and entertainment.
5,A book worth the read!,"This historical fiction captures the hearts of all readers. It is the story of a young girl raised in Barbados struggling to fit in with the Americans of the 1600's. When Kit arrives in America she is like a tropical bird trying to mix with pidgeons. She is looked upon with suspicion because she can swim and read. As Kit's strong personality becomes clear to the reader, one grows to love her and applaud her actions. Elizabeth George Speare created a character who demands ones respect and a book that earns it. It's a good read, enjoy it!"
1,"The Witch of Blackbird Pond is tedious,dull and too long","I think this book is too boring for kids to read.it is very tedious and continues with the same boring facts over and over for 224 pages in a row and when it finally does get to an ok part it only says 5 words on it.my favorite parts are few and far between.it also has incorrect information.what is the chance of a person from the barbados,which are further south than the bahamas and very close to the equator,having no tan whatsoever and speaking perfect english?I rest my case."
2,A great and entertaining historical-fiction!,_The Witch of Blackbird Pond_ is a very entertaing historical-fiction. The time it took place was during the time when the American colonies were being settled. This book was well written and would be great to read for people who love soap operas. There was not a lot of action in this book and no adventure. At times I didn't even want to read the book and other times I was locked on to it. There is some irony in this book and it can get very exciting. I think a lot of people would enjoy this book very much!!
5,Trying to Fit In...,"The Witch of Blackbird Pond is the book to read! It's about a girl name Katherine Tyler (Kit) who comes to a small New England town from nice, warm Barbados. As soon as she gets there many people think she is a witch because she can swim. She's not, but no one believes her except for her aunt and uncle who she's staying with. Then one day Kit meets someone who is different from anyone else--Hannah Tupper, a Quaker. Kit becomes good friends with this elderly woman and winds up in trouble as a result. If you want to find out what happens to her next, READ THIS BOOK!! Also, if you're interested in witch-hunts, mystery, and excitement you've got to read it!"
3,It is worth the price,"I purchased this and a coffee table. The assembly was very simple and easy. I will caution that the rail, the legs attach to, was barely in place. If you want to make a secure attachment, very carefully remove the rail, sandpaper the side and were it goes onto the table and add a little wood glue. Be sure to wipe off any acccess with a damp cloth. Permenant fix, if you comfortable at that."
5,Would Recommend,We wanted something nice and not too expensive for the newly furnished basement. The tables could not be too small and needed to match other light oak furniture. The tables were easy to assembly. We are very happy with our selection. The delivery was much quicker than we anticipated.
5,Very timely and well-written,"Cecilia Martin has succinctly presented the background of the present problems in the Catholic Church and who is responsible. All of us need this book to tell us how to defend our church from its enemies within and how to find and use the resources of the Church to be intelligent, well-informed Catholics and apologists. Thanks!"
4,the bottom line,"In the film world,it's about audience. Writers travel weary miles to meet their audience. In the Ad Center, they taught me that the audience is saying: Why do I care?This book introduces you to your audience--the readers who will actually give you a rating on your admissions essay. They're tired, bored, underpaid--but they know what your choice college likes!Do not skip this part of this good book!Margaret Fleming"
5,It is obviously a great guide for international applicants,"First of all, I should mention that I am a Chinese applicant that is not so familiar with the application system in the U.S. but want to study in the Amercian colleges, so my suggestion will be effective to those international students.This small book told me a lot about the details in the admission office of how they decide to admit or deny you. Furthermore, Mr. Bauld wrote like a tutor beside you to inform you how to present a great masterpiece that can affect in your application. What I have read are the methods to create the essays you wanna show to the officers. We often have a lot ideas in mind but do not know how to organize them and change them into an essay, that is what this book will help us to solve!"
5,A profoundly moving narrative.,"HBO documentaries are almost always well-received by the critics and viewers alike. This book is an invaluable chronicle of slavery in America, based on the HBO special. It is simply excellent."
5,Full Skip,"perfect fit, and wonder why I haven't had one for so long. non clinging, full coverage and absolutely perfect for light weight comfort."
4,Very nice slip,"This is a very nice slip. It fits well and is the right length (a little above the knee) for most of my dresses. The shoulder straps do fall down at times during the day as the plastic adjusters slip down, but can easily be re-adjusted. I have that problem with most slips so am used to it. I had an old slip just like this one and it was falling apart with age so this was a replacement. I was happy to find it on Amazon and received it quickly and for a reasonable price."
1,Speed Race Car Remote Control,"this toy is bad, Send my time is bad.But business is good,trustworthyHope after business before the shipment can add check the quality of the goods."
2,A programmers nightmare,"This film is nothing more that a cheap horror film. It's premise, using computer software to control ones mind is a weak plot line which, considering it is the central theme, could have been presented in a fashion that might have been semi-believeable. I don't know which would be worse, being controlled by the games in the movie, or having to sit through it."
3,Zoot Suit,"I saw this on the Independent Film many years ago, very good film, revolves around Gangs but gangs in the 1940's.Also a film about Latinos (my people) and the problems they face in the inner city.It's much better than those terrible soap opera's in Mexico, this film is a musical but it's also a drama focusing on different Hispanic characters.Edward James Olmos career is synomonus with these type of filmsmost notable ""American Me"", ""Stand and Deliver"", ""My family""a great actor who is part of the real population.Despite the great performances the film does suffer fromits story, you know several hot headed characters with theirattitude and lifestyles are only headed downhill and theirfates are predetermined.Still ""Zoot Suit"" is a good film."
4,ZoOt SuiT,"This is a spectacular display of the 1940's and a wonderful celebration of the Chicano culture!! A must see for any fan of La Bamba. Mastermind director Valdez creates and captures the escence in the life of a zoot suiter. Backed up by an amazing soundtrack of the toe tapping art of Swing music, you can't miss with ""Zoot Suit""!!"
5,ZOOT SUIT-EXCELLENT,"I saw the ZOOT SUIT play version in Hollywood...was great. And I know this VHS version is just as good, is something you want to see over and over again. Edward James Olmos is fantastic and all the cast and story is are very emotional......"
5,great play -- feels very contemporary!,"I heard Franzen speak about how unfaithful the recent NY production was to Wedekind's anarchistic perspective. This is a brash and funny send up of modern society's sexual hypocrisy. Fast read, too."
3,surprising....,"I read the hype and heard the author's own words praising this book. I found it to be a light read at best. The plot was okay, and it had a few engaging moments, but the execution was too simplistic and amateur. Could have been a summer paperback - or in my case, thank goodness it was a library book. Nothing new here."
2,Rather dull and boring to listen to,A big disappointment after Morning Glory.Some tracks are engrossing but the rest is a lack effort.
4,An underated masterpiece,"Personally i feel this album has not got its just deserves. I am a huge Oasis fan and although not quite as good as Whats the Story morning glory, it certianly comesa close. Nearly all the tracks are superb with stand by me, i hope i think i know, dont go away and all around the world taking the front line. This album is great to listen to and was unfailry snubbed by all those set-in-their-way alternative music fans who think its cool to hate Oasis. A legend of an album by a legend of a band. Peace out."
2,Sentimental & Depressing,"Was having a tough day when ordering this. Music from teenage years. These were songs I liked back in the day. However, compared to most of the other music I have or listen to, Oasis is a downer. If I can get past the depressing quality of the music, it's fine.Find different, less depressing music."
3,"Good, but not as good as expected",Oasis took over a year to make this album and the final product doesn't justify this lenght of time. Some catchy tunes.
4,Despues del Exito: un Gran Disco !,"Despues del exito del disco anterior, todo apuntaba a OASIS, y supieron manejar esto, sacando un disco muy bien producido, con una ejecucion excelsa, un sonido mas crudo que el anterior y lleno de pequeños homenajes a otras grandes bandas inglesas"
4,Whats the story?,"I just dont get it, Noel writes two superb albums and then lets him self down with an sub par record. Yeah its good but listen to the other two albums and youll realise that this is dross comperd with them. But it is still a good album and if another band had recorded it we would be hailing them as the new oasis."
3,Bloated Brit-POP,"In 1997 we all awaited the next Oasis album and we listened to all the hype. It was supposed to be ""the next big thing"" but it turned out to be a self indulgent piece of overproduced crap. Don't get me wrong ""D'ya know what I mean"" and ""Stand by me"" are good songs but they are really just recycled longer oasis tunes, like ""Wonderwall"" and ""Live Forever"". You get the feeling they were reaching for the stars and couldn't make it through the hole in the ""ozone layer"". What is a ""Magic pie""?..I like ""don't go away"" though. Buy ""Morining Glory"" and screw this cd. If you do buy it it makes a good coaster for a drink. Peace."
3,A poor effort,"Oasis third album it's a really weak record , too many beatles references , and they don't get even close to those great beatles songs they just try to copy them every time they see the oportunity , some tracks (most of them) are boring and stupid , except for the girl in the dirty shirt , it's gettin better man , and be here now , the other ones are just crap , better buy whats the story morning glory than this one"
4,You'll have fun listening to this british-pop ablum,You can have fun listening to this wonderful album or you can be at work while listening to this and still get alot out of it. Its fun and relaxing and you will want to listen to it over and over again!
4,In Tribute,"This biography was written to honor the memory of Sir/Dr. Kai Ho Kai of Hong Kong. It has been prodigiously researched and offers a detailed picture of political life/activity in Hong Kong in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Dr. Ho Kai never practiced medicine but instead went into law. The Alice Memorial Hospital in HK is named for his first wife, an Englishwoman. Given the times in which Dr. Kai Ho Kai lived, when HK was a British colony,when there were clear class and racial distinctions, I wish the author had explored more fully--if that were possible--the feelings of his subject. His interracial marriage in itself was unique. On the mainland China was attempting to regain sovereignty over its own affairs. I felt a sense of Dr. Kai Ho Kai's accomplishments but not of the man himself. I admire the author for bringing him to our attention."
5,You have to know what your doing,This plane takes alot to get off the ground you really have to throw this thing but once its up there your good to go i would recommend to stand on top of hill and throw it so it has more of a chance getting airborne.
1,THIS GAME SUCKS!!,"I mean it is really sweet to have super psiquic powers , but damn it the story line sucks!! And you suddenly start fighting strange creatures, it just doesn't fit!!"
5,FIVE MAN MASTERPIECE,"One of tesla's best albums, every track is great, especially with the awesome SHM. Must have for any CD collection, but don't pay these ridiculous over-inflated rip off prices. I purchased mine from The Music Specialist on E Bay, save yourself a ton of cash!"
5,good for getting up to speed on JSTL,"This book was very helpful for getting up to speed on JSTL. My company is about to kick off a new struts project, so we needed to get up so speed on using JSTL with Struts. There wasn't much coverage on this, but overall the book was good."
4,Well written book on JSTL,"Most of the time I don't bother reading books on bleeding edge technology, but I bought this book for several reasons. One, the book is well written with examples. Two, reading the book is much easier than reading the specifications from Sun. Three, it's a good reference book. Having read the servlet and jsp specs from servlet 1 & jsp .9 to the current versions, interpretting the specification can be a challenge. Those who are interested in JSTL and need an environment that is friendly to web designers/HTML coders should consider this book.I used to have a small collection of tech books that were poorly written and useless, but JSTL isn't in that category. The book has already proved it's worth and saved time and needless head scratching."
5,"Great, fun and interesting read!",This was an great book to read. The story is fun and interesting which keeps you engaged in the story. It is so entertaining it is like an action movie that has deep and intricat pot. I could not put the book down. All in all it is a great book.
3,"Olden days style, but okay","This story is only readable if you recognize that it was written at the turn of the century. LAST century. The dialogue, the gender roles, the overly-successful hero, and the basic ideas about Mars are so very old-fashioned. But if you recognize the time period that it was written in, then it becomes palatable. Not the best story ever, but it did keep me reading."
4,Classic Adventure from the turn of the 20th Century!!,"ERB was a great storyteller, wrapping the reader in rousing tales of purple prose with wild and reckless abandon. He didn't weight his narrative down with drawn out psuedo-scientific explanations, he set up the plot and was off to the races! My first reading of Tarzan after countless viewings of Johnny Weismueller cavorting around was a revelation. I love how these books from waaaaayy back carry the feel of the times in which they are written. Social values and behavior in a more puritanical setting are fun to watch play out. Princess of Mars downloaded quickly, no issues!"
4,Classic Sci-fi,"This is a classic scifi book.. I'd recommend it as a must have for any Kindle collection! Its entertaining, fun to read and is one of my favorite books which I can read again and again"
4,Super Reader,"Take a brawny Virginian adventurer, and get him to the Red Planet. Have him captured by aliens. Let there be a beautiful woman with an exotic name for him to fall for. Add a castastrophic failure of technology that could doom the planet except for the slim chance that John Carter, our hero, can save the day.Not to mention the odd battle or war."
4,Princess Of Mars,I was interested in the book after watching the movie John Carter. The story was fun to read and the patterns of speech were interesting. I'm guessing they reflected the uptown speech patterns of the day between 1910-20.
5,a book for sci-fi fans,this book is not for all but i like sci-fi and this is great i will look into his ather works
3,yep,"i downloaded this cause it was free, i did this knowing it might be bad or good. I played it probably once and then deleted when i realized i had all these things and nothing really useful."
5,Welcome to Barsoom,"Retired confederate soldier and southern gentleman John Carter is pursued by Indians, and through unexplainable circumstances finds himself transported to Barsoom, known to us earthlings as the planet Mars. There he finds a dying planet of brutal and untamed savagery, contrasted sharply with the rich cultures of its ancient races. Arriving alone, naked and friendless, ""A Princess of Mars"" tells the tale of how John Carter, with the aid of his earthly strength and agility, sets forth on an incredible adventure against enormous odds to rescue the beautiful Dejah Thoris, the incomparable Princess of Helium.One of Edgar Rice Burrough's earliest works, the first chapter in the Martian series is also one of his finest. A page turning adventure with lots of action make John Carter one of Burrough's most beloved heroes. His imagination ran wild in creating the martian landscape, and this is a delight to read for all ages."
3,The book seems to be better than it was on TV,"It an okay book, full of action but you wonder how out of everyone he gets picked to go from Earth to Mars and back. And of course, he's so strong and skilled with everything. Amazing."
1,Doesn't work,This does not fit my Palm TX. I even turned the plastic stick upside down like someone said. The only way the Palm will stay in the case is face down!!!! Useless and a complete waste of money.
1,HEAVY AND INCONVENIENT,"This case is ""sticky"" to open, a bit heavy and so each time you want to use your unit, you have to struggle with it. It sort of compromises the reason you have a PDA to begin with."
1,RUN!!!! RUN FAR AWAY!!!,"This product is junk. It is cheaply constructed and broke the instant I attempted to place my palm TX in it. The cheap plastic slide piece that attaches the PDA to the case would break in a stiff breeze. The neoprene lining lifts off in humid weather or whenever it feels like it. The memory card slots are a joke and the shoddy belt clip is the punch line. Without a doubt, the worst online purchase I have ever made."
2,Good but could be so much better,"I've had mine for a couple months now.It's very solid and looks great.I've only dropped my Palm once but its slipped off of things twice. The case cushioned my Palm TX just fine.What could be better is:1. If the outside finish were slightly rubberized. As is this puppy is very slick. In your hand or just about any surface you place it on. To slick.2. It were hinged on the top instead of the side. I have large hands and holding this case open in my hand during use is straight up a pain in the hand. And don't forget the part above about this case being slick which makes it an even bigger pain to juggle. It would be much easier to use if it were hinged on the top. Placing the hinge on top would also work to ensure that the memory card doesn't accidently pop out.I love this case but the two flaws have me looking for another case and recommending that you keep looking for another, more functional case."
3,Palm Armour,"I didn't specially liked it. I found it bit rough on the edges, and it gets scratched really easily. But it does the job of protecting my palm."
2,Not as pictured,"-Not as pictured-Pour spout too wide-No lip on the pour spout(as pictured, there is one)-Milk runs down the pitcher at times since the spout is so wide."
2,Disceptive Photo,I'm sure the pitcher is great and works fine. You can't really go wrong with a simple stainless steel pitcher. My concern is the main photo in the product description page. That photo is either of a different pitcher all together or it is photoshoped to appear taller than it actually is. Observe the user submitted photo I put in compared to the product photo. 2 stars for misrepresentation.
4,perfect size,perfect size for frothing milk. I have a jura T9 and a krupps super automatic and this works great with both of them.
2,disappointed,This book was sold out. after I purchased it I recieved an e-mnail telling me that it was out of stock and I would be refunded my purchase price in five to six weeks. Good News is It took less time to get my refund.
1,micro powder salt,The micro salt was not really powder. The salt was micro in size but did not have the ability to cling or stay on a food substance when applied. After thinking about it I don't think it can be changed into real powder form. Other then being really high in cost will stop me from purchasing it again. However I was glad to see this product exist in this form anyway. Thank you.
5,Great!,"I thought that since this book was based on a video game, it would just be a little flick to make a little mula, but Eric Nylund is a greater writer and keeps you guessing wwith the Halo series!"
5,A Treat for Fans of the Games,"Fall of Reach: Prequel to Halo:CEThe Flood: Takes place during Halo:CEFirst Strike: Sequel to Halo:CE and ties together Halo 1 and 2The Halo Book trilogy is spectacular. Many books that are based on video games are poorly written and are unoriginal. However, the Halo series are remarkably good and develop the characters met in Halo: CE as well as provide hundreds of years of backstory about the Halo universe. The levels of detail are amazing, and they make action scenes exciting. It is obvious that the writers and Bungie took there books seriously enough to put major energy and thought into them, and any fan of the game owes it to themselves to read them."
5,Saved me hundreds of dollars,I like being able to read these books since I don't own an Xbox and am not good at playing video games. It's enjoyable to have the story unfold without restarting.
4,HALO books Baby.,"This is something i have been meaning to get for a long time but never got around to it. But i got it today, and as usual Amazon is super speedy in its deliveries. So thank you on that. My only problem was that the corners were damaged as if they were dropped. All in all good."
1,Don't waste your money,"I notice that 9 of the reviews are posted by the same person, A Customer. It looks like the author is trying to get a better rating by making up reviews. The book is trash don't buy it."
5,A must for the flytyer's bookshelf!,"Poul Jourgensen has brought this ancient and beautiful art to life. The recognized master of the art trains anyone with basic fly tying skills how to build a masterpiece.In the book, one learns not only the techniques on how to tie the Atlantic salmon patterns, but also the reasons behind specific asspects of the craft (How to use oval ribbing to protect the hackle from the fish's teeth).New substitutes for old materials, excellent illustrations, and a building block style of instruction make this a mandatory addition to any flytyer's bookcase"
4,Great service!,"No problem whatsoever , I received in 10 days for regular post office service but I dont care because I bought this book for personnal enrichment. Everybody should read this book."
1,Fluffly vaugeries about nothing.,"Here is a book that talks about thoery, dinsintergration, and practice of love, but really says nothing. He uses vauge phrases like ""the union of conformity...is insufficient to pacify the anxiety of seperateness"" Does't help a person have a better relationship. Only creates mythical boxes for love such as ""God Love, Brotherly Love, Self Love, and Motherly Love"" which he describes in equally abstract language. Would recommend this book only for college students who need to write a report on love, but not for anyone with an interest in enriching their life."
2,a nice thought,"this book explores love and what it means. Love is not defined here, and it is merely described. That's nice, but is narrowly defined as loving everyone and as part of a ""loving personality."" For some reason, it's not okay to love say, your girlfriend or your child or your mother more than anyone else... according to him, we must love everyone. Love is not a personality type just as much as excitement is not a personality type. Love is sometimes exclusive... isn't that why there is jealousy? It is a good read and a good text, and offers insight into human nature."
5,From Long ago to this minute,For anyone who is seeking a fuller more rewarding lifeand knows they are spiritual - the marriage of quatumphysics and prayer is deeply moving.
4,Restates much information from earlier works,"After having read all other works by Braden, I was somewhat disappointed by the lack of new information. The book seems to follow closely the message in the tape set ""The Lost Mode of Prayer"". It is a great read if you have not heard ""The Lost Mode of Prayer"", since it does cover information not covered in his earlier works (which I highly recommend)."
3,Barbara Tucker plays a minor role,"Following Ms Tucker's career since the early 90's, this is the first slightly disappointing track. The other singer on this track, Daryl d'Bonneau, dominates it. I miss the Masters at Work-influenced sound like on 'Stay together' or DJ Pierre's influence on 'Everybody dance'. Barbara: please be careful when you're ready to choose the production team for your next song."
2,Not bad until she starts . . . whatever that is.,"Screaming? More like being strangled. How could they possibly have played that back and decided it was a good idea? Pity, because otherwise the mixture of good girl vocals and hard chunky guitars, combined with good hooks in the songwriting department is very pleasing to the ears. And then . . . they decide to put a plastic bag over her head and mic her yelling. Bizarre; almost every track starts out compelling and becomes unlistenable to the point of being laughable."
5,Grieving the Loss of a Loved One,"This is an astounding book. Couldn't put it down. Really brings to life all the grief, sorrow, loneliness, emptiness, that I feel. It is good to know that I am ""normal"" in my feelings and not losing my mind. A must-read book for someone who is alone."
3,"Bryan Adams should stick to his own ""music""","What a dissapointment.Bryan Adams wails ""lyrics"" throughout the song.Don`t Worry if the sun don`t shine,you`ve seen it before,you don`t need to worry always makes me laugh everytime I hear it.On the plus side is the absolutely fabulous Tomski vs Disco Citizens mix where Adams is restricted to a listenable ""Don`t Give Up"" every 3 minutes.If there was an instrumental of the original version I would certainly give this 5 stars because the music to it is great.It`s a real pitty that Bryan Adams ruins it for me and the fact that it will be remembered as a Bryan Adams song,even though he did`nt write it,rather than a Chicane song."
5,HIS ABSOLUTE BEST!!,"The ""definition of love"" cd is one of his best yet! It just proves once again what a talented and smooth voiced singer he is.Romantic, calming and certanily knows how to capture you. He does an absolutely lovely job of singing ""I dont want to miss a thing"" as well. In fact he does a wonderful job with singing all of his songs. Listening to this cd will just want you to want more...THIS IS A MUST HAVE....DEFINITELY WORTH PURCHASING......YOU WONT REGRET IT."
4,Vegielicious,Bragg does it again with this All Natural Ginger & Sesame Salad dressing which begs you to find vegetables to eat. This dressing makes your vegies so delicious that you almost want to just keep eating vegetables. What is even most pleasuable is to know that you enjoyed a healthy dressing with no regrets. An added benefit is the reasonable price.
2,Very mixed results,"I guess I'm in the minority because I've had very mixed results. I took a chi running clinic in December and PR'd in a half marathon about five week later, by 18 minutes. I felt like I was having a running renaissance at age 44, but that only lasted another few weeks. Since then, I've been plagued by injuries. At this point, calf injuries have kept me from running for about 2.5 months, which makes no sense as the chi running books (and I have both of them) claim that you don't use your calf muscles with the method. That didn't make much sense to me when I read it, and it certainly doesn't now. So I guess my advice is not to expect a miracle cure and recognize that some of the advice and statements in these books make little sense from a medical standpoint--perhaps because the authors have no medical training. That said, I've been to plenty of sports docs and physical therapists over the years, and they weren't very helpful, either."
5,Instant improvement - unbelievable,"I have been running for over 10 years and struggling to improve my pace, no matter which methods I have tried. I just figured I am slow to improve. Maybe running is not my thing. I was intrigued about the barefoot running concept so I picked up this book. After reading just a few chapters of ChiRunning, I went out for an easy run and tried out some of the strategies. First - I ran over 3 miles without an issue (this distance is tough for me) second - a whole minute per mile was shaved off my usual pace. Just like that. BOOM. An improvement that was once only attainable after months of dedicated training (suffering) was achieved instantly. I attribute it mostly to the advice on proper running form, however I like the way it is explained and the emphasis on mindfulness. I am into yoga/meditation and all that so I can connect well to this method."
4,chirunning,revolutionary way of running - well worth the effort and well explained - but you will need some help implementing it and it takes a long time. Good book!
1,Not a revolutionary idea,"""ChiRunning"" is not a new idea. This running method has beendescribed and advocated by Dr.Nicholas Romanov since 1977 as a pose method of running. Visit his website; [...]. It is very annoying to see the description of ""ChiRunning"" a revolutionary idea by simply attaching ""Chi"" to the pose method [...]. ""Chi"" part of this book is very superficial."
1,Redundant...and redundant,"Listened to this on audiobook, and I feel like the whole thing could have been done in an hour. He repeats the same phrases over and over, and makes unnecessary belabored examples, as if trying to make the book as cliche as possible...Body, mind, spirit, balance, chi, energy, core...it sounds as if its designed to be an infomercial.Maybe this book is intended for new runners, but as a runner for over 30 years, it annoyed me to no end. Others have commented on this hypermarketing too. His advertisements for chi walking and chi living underscore his goal to make a brand. He uses the phrase ""Chi running"" at least 30 times in the first audiobook section, a phrase which essentially didnt exist until he created it, with no explaination of what it actually is until later. Long term runners beware."
5,BUY ONE NOW!!!,"Were do I start with this product... Its AWESOME! nearly pays for itself after one use. Great way to get out with your kid or friends on a nice day. No more driving range fees, play in your back yard, don't worry about taking out a window."
5,Good Ending,A good end to the series. I just wish it was not over because the manga keeps going. A good mix of action and humor.
4,The Mightiest,"Ya know something. This is a great series for any anime watcher to consider. I personally liked it because the main character Kenichi undergoes a series of training techniques to become a more skilled and courageous individual. There are a bunch of funny points in the series too which always keeps a smile going. Overall, I'd give Kenichi the Mightiest Disciple a 9 out of 10"
4,real good,"Had never heard of the guy - got it at a bookstore because it had 1200 pages (I needed a lot to read) and because it was written by an old guy (well, he's old now, at least - well- wrinkled but kind looking). So far I'm about a third of the way through it, but like everyone else has said, this book is great. Some writers get lazy and write the same story over and over. Not this guy - every character, every situation is unique. For people who like movies, read the one about Istafan and compare it to ""Lost in Translation"". The story about the swingers party is indescribably great also, just in the way he describes a man kissing a woman's hair or them barely dancing at all."
3,Good but not great,"I bought wire tap scars a few months ago and was totally blown away by the C.D. Porcelain however is much more subdued and although most of the songs are good it seems they put this album out just for the sake of putting out an album. It was almost like listening to one huge song, which some people enjoy, I on the other hand do not. This C.D. will have to tide me over until they put out another."
1,Oooofffaaah...,Saw them live with Dredg and they stunk up the joint...badly.Don't compare them to TMV...no comparsion in any manner.
2,take a peak first,"A fast read, has some helpful teaching points and very general commentary on japanese society. Seems a bit outdated too, at least my 1992 edition does. A lot of time spent covering things you could easily look up on the web. If you are going to Japan through JET, you will have heard a lot of this stuff by the time you get to Japan. Definitely check this out in a bookstore before buying, probably give it a pass."
4,What a great idea!,"This is a great tool for the N64. It combines two great components of the system. With four memory paks (492 notes!) and a rumble pak with two rumble settings, you can't go wrong. Save all of your games in rumble style! The only problem is that when you start games with the switch at the memory setting, usually says that your memory pak is damaged. But with a press of a button, you can repair it and your well on your way."
5,Superb,"I am really happy with the result of this product. Just follow the instruction, take it regularly. You'll be able to get the result within one week. Now I feel better refreshed, better smashed. Thanks to the company for making it available in the amazon."
2,These are full frame. Original releases were widescreen!!!,"Wake of Death and In Hell, should have been released in theaters in the U.S. Wake of Death played theaters in Europe and was a hit. In the U.S. they both could have been Van Damm's comeback films. Derailed- stinks. If your a film junkie, do not buy this triple feature. All 3 films are full screen. You really only need Wake Of Death and In Hell. I purchased both from Amazon marketplace sellers and got them cheaper than the cost of this set. In fact Wake Of Death was the best $3.00 movie I ever purchased. (.01 cent plus 2.99 for shipping) Whats funny, I am not a fan of JCVD, I just kept reading great reviews on both films and the fact that Ringo Lam and Simon Yam where involved (One of my favorite HK directors and I am a fan of Simon Yam)in the making of each film."
3,Newbie suffers,"I wont't comment vis a vis otrher MP3 players as this is the first one I used. BUT:1. The manual is worthless ... no explanation of how to use SW,2. The manual only comes as a pdf and that is pfotected so it will not print.3. Creative offers telephone support bankers hours only 9-6 CT.4. The poewr supply is as big as an ipod. The ipod can charge from a USB port!4. SW is buggy."
5,nice puzzle,"nice puzzle for the Christmas season, very enjoyable putting this puzzle togeather and a good way to get into the Christmas spirit"
3,A Book on Moral Philosophy,"Professor Alasdair MacIntyre in ""A Short History of Ethics"" produced an interesting book covering the long history of moral philosophy. The author provides a historical background and perspective for studying the selected texts on moral philosophy.The book first provides the reader with an account of Greek thought and the philosophical basis of their thinking. The author then proceeds to discuss the history of philosophy to the present day. The reader is then able to appreciate the discussion of moral philosophy in the appropriate historical context.I enjoyed reading the book, although I would not classify it among the best books on the subject. The author seems to assume that the reader has some understanding of philosophy which would make it difficult for those without some understanding of the subject to follow his arguments. However, the book should be of value to people with an interest in moral philosophy."
2,So Bad It's...Bizarre,"This has got to be one of the loopiest films I've ever seen. Does it work? Not really. Is it fun to watch? With these women, how could it not be? But don't expect logic in any way, shape or form. (Keeping track of who is or isn't a lesbian alone could make your head spin.) Unfortunately, don't expect good songs, either. Why make a musical with such paltry material? I guess the director's answer would be ""why not"" -- which is pretty much the feel (and philosophy) for this entire film."
2,A dark farce,"that can't decide whether it's a murder mystery or a parody of one. Each character has a < gasp! > song, each worst than the last. Its message is the women in any man's life will drive him crazy. Sure, the eight women here are the best that French cinema has to offer, though Catherine Deneuve is a bit of a dumpling despite being typecast as a closet ""Sapphist."" But the movie's unit setting is more typical of stage than cinema. And it drags, horribly. You might find its compendium of French insults interesting. But if you don't, it's just a director stringing cliches together to abuse both art & audience. Probably not worth your time, and certainly not worth your trouble."
3,Check MacKenzie's band!,"As most reviewers are fond of Joseph K. MacKenzie's tune dedicated to his grandfather in this soundtrack, I would strongly recommend MacKenzie's band called Clann an Drumma. It is really cool tribal celtic music! Unfortunately, their cds are not available in amazon, but you can order them through their web page: [...]. You won't be disappointed at all!!!"
4,It's the Soundtrack!,"I must admit that I loved the movie and have watched it a number of times. Quite frankly the soundtrack is an experience best enjoyed while watching the film. I wish to avoid any misunderstanding and can only say that the music is both beautiful and inspired, however it loses something in the translation when it is plugged into the CD player of my convertible and not the CD player of my home theatre, right there with the movie!"
5,See the film .... but ALSO: read the book !,"Definitely one of the few books that give you the feeling that life is just worth living. Once you realize what is 'ultimate catastrophe' or 'the one unforgivable sin', you will see life differently. If you have seen the film and listened to the music, go forward and read the book"
2,Zorba the Greek,"The quality of the materials was very disappointing, also parts of the orignal book were deleted. This was especially bad because it was for a gift. Further, I will not ever have any item gift wrapped. It was pretty cheesy."
1,"What are we rating here? The book, or ourselves?","I happen to think this is an awful book. Zorba is irritatingly larger than life, yet one-dimensional. The narrator is shallow and immature. I did not think the structure and writing to be very good either.However, looking at some of the reviews, many higher ratings went coincided with admiration of a zest for life, unbound enthusiasm, empathy for indulgence in food, music and sex, and a readiness to forgive blatant sexism, quasi-philosophy, and Taliban-style clan justice. Lower ratings were not as easy to connect, but many less positive reviewers had a more jaded look on life, did not suffer fools gladly, and would not spend a lot of time with either Zorba, the narrator, or the murderers of a suspect widow.In the interest of disclosure, I am a 62 year old hetero European male, and I would find spending time with the narrator cruel and unusual punishment, but I could possibly get to like Zorba, on condition he'd shut up, and play the santuri."
2,ok but hardly worth the price,The performance is ok but they are bulky especially to store and carry. Performance is good but not exceptional and hardly worth the price tag. Other electronics firms lower prices as products get older but Bose seems to have an elevated opinion of theirs which is too bad.
1,buyer BEWARE!,"This was the worst pair of headphones I've ever bought, and it was not easy to get the local Bose store to give me a full refund on them despite their advertised ""no hassle refund"" policy.Terrible sound, poor ergonomics, medicore ""noise cancellation""---never again will I buy another Bose product! I should've known better, my husband has a ridiculous Bose Wave radio which he now tells everyone that he ""won at a Christmas raffle at the office"" because he's too embarassed to confess that he paid half a grand for the thing.My son pointed me towards a pair of Sennheisers which were better in every respect, and at one third of the price."
2,Cost Too Much!!!!,OMG......Really? These head phones cost too much to fall apart. Thank you for your comments.I'm tryin to find the perfect pair of headphones and just because it cost alot it does not nessarly mean it's made to be steardy enought.
2,"Good until the wires fray, then you're $####$","For $500 friggin' dollars, you'd think Bose might make some headphones where the wiring doesn't fray so easily. I haven't even had mine for a year and now the wires of frayed and I can only hear out of one headphone.And Bose ""customer service department"" basically tells you you're SOL when you ask about repairs or a replacement.Bose should change their name to ""BLOWS."""
1,Unreasonable support policies,"I agree wholeheartedly with T. Gardner. I loved my QC1 headphones, which I bought for use in an office with noise problems, until they started making a noise that I liken to the noise of a nearby helicopter. The noise is not always there, and I can usually make it stop by fiddling with the positioning of the earpieces. Bose support has offered me two options: repair them for $100 or replace them with QC2s for $188. I consider neither reasonable and unless I can get them repaired for a nominal charge, I will never buy another Bose product."
1,Don't Buy it!,This product has a major default. It is badly designed and breaks very easily at the plastic arms holding the adjustable metal railings above the phones due to a design flaw. This is the second pair that bose replaced for me and they are broke again!!!
2,Not worth the price,"I bought these, they work wonderful for sound reduction if you only use them once in a while. I used mine every day and they did not last 3 months, the plastic above the earpads started cracking and finally gave out. The construction is definitely not worth the price. I just purchased the Sennheiser PXC250 for one-third of the price and while they might not look as chic, the sound is just as good and the fit is okay. Don't buy the Bose unless you have money to burn."
1,Piece of Junk,"Backgammon Attache 18""Backgammon set arrived today. First inspection disappointing. It is poorly constructed, as follows: stitching is inconsistent; points are not sewed down; some side seams ""show air""; board border seams uneven as if not properly glued. The pieces are lightweight, not a good feel. Overall it's seems cheap. Not going to hold up. Does not have the tactile feel of a good procuct. Tactile feel is very important to me. I am disapppointed that the manufacturer did not have a sense of ethics for creating a good product, and that this piece of junk even passed inspection. It may be an acceptable board for a child learning to play, with the caveat that it will not hold up. I now start all over searching the internet for a well made board."
3,"Met expectations, but...","The game certainly met all of my expectations and for the price is a fair value. I do wish that I had purchased a smaller size though - the larger size unit tends to fold up a bit when setting it on our couch or coffee table, making play a little awkward at times. The 15 inch size has worked well in the past for me - the 18 inch size is more suitable for table top play."
3,Doesnt stand,This quality is fine except it doesnt stand up like a briefcase. Its a little large but some may like this.
2,One of my least favorite CD's.,"I thought this CD was bad. This CD almost out beat my least favorite CD that I have (Darwin's Waiting Room). I only liked ""Stick um up"" and ""Wierdo"" the rest of the CD is just a bunch of giberush & swaring. I suggest you don't get this CD it's a waste of money."
3,Nice and warm but the waistband is scratchy,I love these pants and they've held their shape really well and are sooooo comfortable except for the waistband. It kind of cuts in a bit and is itchy and scratchy which leads to a not very enjoyable wear session. I'm going ot attempt inside out from now on.
1,Horrid parents and snobby heroine,"Better than the previous one (""Body in the Basement"")--Faith is just more interesting than Pix--but Page went back to the whole Faith and Tom don't seem to like their kids and shouldn't be parents thing, which is annoying. Faith is also a bit snobby.Note: I've read this entire series up toThe Body in the Attic: A Faith Fairchild Mystery (Faith Fairchild Mysteries), and the best rating I've given any of them is 2 stars, which is sad and says a lot about the series. I kept reading because it really has potential but it never lives up to it, so save yourself the trouble and agony and try a a different series, such as Carolyn Hart'sDeath on Demand (Death on Demand Mysteries, No. 1)series, most of which are fun and enjoyable, or stop afterThe Body in the Cast: A Faith Fairchild Mystery, which was probably the best of the series. That's my recommendation, anyway."
4,A long-time follower,The joy of these mysteries is keeping up with the family and friends over the years. Reading them provides the joys of living in a small New England town (plus recipes!) without the hassles.
2,Mediocre,"This is yet another mediocre release in a litany of mediocre to sub-mediocre music being released by American bands today. What ever happened to originality? Whatever happened to playing music with balls? Why is soul-less pop the rage today? Is this what we've come to? Is this a reflection of the new blandness of the American character? This band shows no originality, no kinetic energy at all. I give them two stars because the musicianship is halfway decent. A surprising number of Seattle music fans who consider themselves hip and musically sophisticated are settling for the sort of drivel put out by this and other mediocre rock bands. Is there any good new American music out there? Come on folks! I mean -- there is nothing cool about this music at all! END"
5,Could it be any better?,"Migloire in one word, good. I've listed to this cd, more times than i've listened to any of the 100 cds I own. It never makes me sleepy, it never gets old, thats how good it is. I had these expectations and anticipations for the release of this amazing piece of work and it surpassed them all. Matthew, Mona and Steve.. when can we expect the next masterpiece?"
3,"A nice pedometer with some nice features, but some problems","A nice compact little pedometer, which fits very easily into a pocket or clips onto a belt. It speaks distance and steps taken. However, there are some problems. It's too easy to accidentally press the button on top that turns on the very annoying music, and it's too easy to accidentally press the button on top that turns the alarm on, and it's too easy to accidentally press the big button on the front that will speak the number of steps and distance you've walked. Also, the pedometer, including the display, is always on, and that leads to premature battery exhaustion. Oh, yes, good luck replacing the button battery - to do so requires removing 4 small screws, and forcing off a little clip that covers the battery."
5,A review of Til l We have Faces,"I bought Till We Have Faces based only on a familiarity with the Narnia chronicals that I read as a kid. Knowing nothing of the ""classic myth of Cupid and Psyche"", I let this book sit on my bookshelf for months before I opened it one rainy day. What a mistake! I was drawn in by Lewis' elegant, simple story of two sisters and how their relationship colors their lives. The plot and characterization are accessible to the casual reader, but the allegorical relationship to the ancient myth gives it deeper meaning. This is one of the rare novels which nourishes your soul while providing pure enjoyment."
2,Late arrival,"I received this book in late December, months after I ordered it and long after I needed it. I contacted the seller and received no reply."
4,Not too bad.,"For a low budget Japanese horror movie, Slaughter Island wasn't too bad. It had an interesting monster killing them off and the girls were cute."
3,Worked great while it lasted - which wasn't long,"It worked great for keeping soft drinks cold at work for about a year and a half, then the fan motor got extremely loud. Will look for a more reliable mini-fridge this time."
4,Labeling Life,"With all the needs of computers, there are so many great pieces of software we honestly need to use for everyday life, and creating labels in honestly one of them. With the Printshop Business Card & Label Creator, it absolutely works very well as you can easily make and design labels of any kind. You can make labels for your needs and wants like creating and designing your own address labels for shipping packages, to setting up ordinary setups for when you need to send out traditional letters. But, my favorite featureon this software is that you can actually design create C.D. labels for jewel cases, for when you design your own music albums. It is a convient buy, and works great with Windows XP, as well as a good job on Vista. It works just as well as those more expensive label making software discs. I absolutely recommend this a whole lot.Price: B 1/2+Convience: B+Overall: B+"
4,ZNP Soap Replaced with Sulfur Soap 10% by Dermatologists,"Since ZNP Soap was discontinued my Dermatologist recommends Joesoef Skin Care Acne Sulfur Soap 10% to replace the ZNP Soap that is no longer available. Sulfur is anti bacterial, anti fungal and its a natural antiseptic soap. Theses qualities are excellent in the treatment of Acne, Psoriasis, Dermatitis, Blackheads and whiteheads and more. For best results use warm water and work soap into a rich lather, its important to allow 60 seconds before rinse, this allows the sulfur to penetrate deep into your pores killing all the bacteria and fungus on contact while at the same time it will gently remove dead skin cells and reduce the redness and inflammation caused by the acne. Joesoef Skin Care Sulfur Soap 10% is available online at [..] or from your local dermatologists. Hopes this helps...."
1,i love the squids!,i have both vol. one and two... love them! i ordered vol. three from copemania and that was in early march .. still getting the runaround! it is April 21st. and i am still waiting.....if i ever get it i know i will love it too!
4,Acton packed !!!,The movie was loaded with lots of action. Fun to watch. Would reccomend it to anyone to watch.
5,the best batman movie i've waited for years!,"batman begins is the best batman movie in years!i,m so going to get on dvd batman, batman returns, batman forever, batman and robin, and of course batman begins!this movie is about how bruce wayne turned to batman.he trains to be a ninja in asia then gotham city is useless.bruce has to turn to batman!so he gets all of his gadgets and suits and a symbol.he has to kill the scarcrow and ducard because they are destroying gotham city into panik!!!!!bruces love, rachel dawes saves the city!!!"
5,The Best of the Live Action Batman movies!,I have very little to say about this movie:1. It is the best of the live action Batman movies. It captures what made the comic books so good unlike the Burton/Schumacher era or as I call them: Burmachers. It falls short of the Bruce Timm produced Animated Series.2. Christian Bale is a great Bruce Wayne and a good Batman! Before Bale the best of the Batmen was Adam West and considering he played Batman for camp that ain't a good thing.3. It isn't just a good superhero movie it's a great movie! It's in Superman: The Movie territory and not Spider-Man/Electra/Superman IV: The Quest for peace territory. This flick should get an Oscar! It's that damn good!In short buy this movie! It is the cinematic definition of shock and awe! Much like the Batman himself!
1,batman begins,when i ordered this product i looked at the picture of the case and when i recieved the blu ray it was in spainish and english which is fine if you show the same picture of the blu ray recieve and not like me which is falsly advertised.
1,i had 3 different copies and the bonus features didn't work,Batman Begins [HD DVD]Ratatouille [Blu-ray]i got this title on hd dvd becuase of the bonus featuresthey were horriblenot only did they not work but they were out of synci had 3 copies and they all did the same thingthe picture in picture was an absolute train wrecknot only did the movie track drown out the pic in pic trackthe little windows would close just as quickly as they appearedbut there would still be a discussioni couldnt enjoyi took it back to best buy in hopes of just a defective copybut 3i gave up and got ratatouoillebut ordered it on blu rayand hopefully the problem has been correctedi have noticed problems with other wb titles too with their pic in pic features
1,Batman Begins... TO SUCK,"LET ME GET ONE THING STRAIGHT, IT ISN'T ONE STAR, BUT 0. THIS WAS THE WORST PIECE OF TRASH BATMAN I HAVE EVER SEEN. OKAY, IN ALL THE BATMAN MOVIES, THERE IS AN AUTHENTIC BATMAN VILLIAN, THERE ISN'T IN THIS ONE. AND, WHEN YOU FIND OUT THAT THE SCARECROW IS IN IT, IT IS A TOTAL RIP OFF. I MEAN, THIS JERK PUTS ON A SCARECROW MASK, AND SAYS BOO. WOW, REALLY FRIGHTENING. AT LEAST THE JOKER WAS A MOBSTER, MR. FREEZE HAD HIS FREEZY GUN, ETC. THEY SHOULD HAVE NEVER MADE THIS MOVIE. BATMAN AND ROBIN WAS THE BEST ONE YET, THEY SHOULD HAVE CONTINUED IT THAT WAY. AND ANOTHER THING, PEOPLE ARE LIKE I HOPE THEY MAKE A BATMAN BEGINS 2. THINK ABOUT IT, IT THIS IS WHERE HE BECOMES BATMAN, AND AT THE END YOU FIND OUT THEY PICK UP WITH THE ORIGINAL, THERE CAN'T BE A BATMAN BEGINS 2. IF ANYONE WOULD EVEN WANT TO MAKE ONE, THEY SHOULD BE SHOT IMMEDIATLY. PASS UP THIS PIECE OF TRASH, AND WATCH THE BEST BATMAN: BATMAN AND ROBIN."
4,Good explanation of Batman's origin.,"I liked this movie because it delved into the origins of Bruce Wayne's transformation into Batman. It was not cartoonish like the previous series of Batman movies had become. After the first batman with Jack Nicholson, it was all downhill for Tim Burton. I highly recommend this movie."
5,Batman Begins is Batman's Best,"It was about time we saw the original roots and essence of Batman; what made him become Batman? What did the Bat represent? All other Batman movies had certain flaws: The first two Batman movies (Batman and Batman Returns by Tim Burton) focused mainly on the enemy instead of the Dark Knight itself. The previous two were just garbage.We see here a Bruce Wayne with fear - something that you didn't see in the previous cape crusader films - and his internal side and reaction towards his parent's death. A more focus on the man without the mask and suit.With an important cast that delivered exceptional performances; Gary Oldman, Cillian Murphy, Michael Caine, Christian Bale and Liam Neeson (who in my opinion gave the best performance in the film); Batman Begins was the Batman movie we were all waiting for."
2,no batmobile!!!!,-1. it took for ever to get started the whole bring the same fear to your enemies was annoying2.there was a classic batman bad guy3.no batmobile+the plot was good except the 1st half and the special were good could have been a lot better
1,Big Movie - But Big Waste of Time !!,"This is a rewrite of my 'Batman Begins' review, which i just wanted to make shorter and more to the point-****Don't believe all the exaggerated publicity regarding this movie.This has to be one of the most over-rated films i've ever seen.Yes, the movie has a big quality to it - it is over-produced and heavy-handed. Watching it was a real drag. Just because a movie has a big feel and look to it, doesn't mean its great.Anyway, to me 'Batman Begins' was a tiresome waste of time and as phony as Batman's hoarse voice. (sounds like in the movie he may have a cold - so instead of pop corn, you may want to have a few cough drops on hand if you decide to watch this).but i would skip this one.peace out & cheers!-CrowTurtle"
1,Very Unhappy!,"Batman Begins (Limited Edition Gift Set) [Blu-ray]I was all ready to watch this Blu-ray movie on the night before Dark Knight opened. When I put it my Sony Blu-ray player it would not play. I later read on the box that some Blu-ray planers need to be upgraded to play the movie. Amazon should have told me about this before I bought this item. Blu-ray players are still very costly, so I am very upset."
4,A Good Place to Begin,"Batman begins is a good movie. It answers several questions for those who have not read the DC series (i.e. Why ""bats""?, Why are all the bad guys escaped from Arkam?, Where does Bruce Wayne get his cool crime fighting gadgetry?, etc.).The stunts are great. The bat-suit and utility belt are still imaginative. The bat-cape is still too cool! And, I want to park my '70s muscle car and drive this bat mobile (unlike the tiresome cars in the previous 4 flicks)!Bale is great as the Caped one. Caine, Freeman, and Hauer are memorable in supporting action.The movie really takes off after the first 30 minutes of Zen-Judo weirdness. The prison and ninja fights scenes are dull and boring- bordering on silly (as usual with martial arts stuff).Take a Date to this movie, you'll both enjoy it."
5,First Rate Epic: Take note Mr. Lucas,"Batman Begins shows that it is possible to have a well plotted movie, with CGI effects shine when you have a set of first rate actors playing the roles.From Bale, to Caine to the Cillian Murphy's absolutely PERFECT Dr. Craine and the even more perfect Liam Neeson the acting not only complements the action and CGI but rises above it.This is a loose adaption of BATMAN year 1 series it is so well done that I can't wait to see the next one.I've yet to see another picture this year that was so worth my money and worth yours.Note to Mr. Lucas, ACTING! ACTING! ACTING!"
5,Yes,We all know what type of movie this was. They should have a law to follow the formula this movie has.
3,Decent cast... not the greatest Batman tale,"I personally found this one a bit of a yawner. The ""origin"" story is painfully long for something everyone but a 5-year-old knows already, no matter how they remix it. They spend too much time on a sullen, easily influenced Batman who seems to care what other people say an awful lot for the Dark Knight. I wish they actually left time for the villain characters instead of having them there for 5-second action sequences once in awhile. I like Tim Burton's vision of Gotham far more as well. The only good thing is with the pointless reworking of Batman's history out of the way, the next movie should be able to focus on more interesting stuff."
4,much better than expectations,"while the movie turned out to be nicely done, it seemed to lack in a few areas. i found myself laughing at the movie during serious seens. one reason because of christain bale pouting his lips when he was batman and the ridiculous lines 'rattle the cages'. some holes in the story also stood out"
1,"Not the product showed, no inside artwork","The movie is great but the most dissapointing thing is that the product is wrong, the metal case has no inside art work, it is not the version I want. How could this happen?? It is not worth 39.9 at all!"
2,If your a Batman fan you'll love it.,This movie was sorta hard for me to get into. I felt like it left out some crucial points and didn't really show the depth of Bruce Wayne's character. Towards the end though I really like it because it started getting action packed and leaving me wanting more but I was very disappointed with the way it ended. It could've been better.
3,The second best in the series,Batman Begins is adifferent than the rest. The begining focuses on emotion and psychology. It's not as dark as Burton's Gotham City and there's a little too much drag before it gets into the good stuff. Once there the movie goes along well and is exciting.
4,Great,"Batman Begins is the start of the best set of Batman movies ever. Great action, good villain choice, great origin story for Batman. -Trent Foreman, Author of Nightmare"
5,the best comic movie after superman,"ignore all the bad critics (luckily a few), they don't know what they're talking about. this one is perfect better than spider-man 2, and arguably as good as superman. why is it better than spider-man 2 ? well in general, spider-man feels a bit comical -some would say that's how it's supposed to be done, but given that's true, it's still a bit melancholic. i think in reality even a poor hi-school student don't look that ""sorry"". Batman feels real all the way, it's more complex emotionally. go watch it.....another strike from chris nolan."
2,Awsome movie. Bad Blu-Ray,"Without going into detail about the movie. Which was great. I have to say Warner is horrible at Blu-ray transfers. The picture is very soft through out the movie. And Dobly Digital? Come on Warner. Thats good enough for your cable/dish box, but not blu-ray. This blu-ray does not take full advatage of what the technology can achieve. I would like to see a remaster of this blu-ray."
3,"movie is great, but dvd skipped 3 times while watching.",Really enjoyed the movie but being brand new out of the package the dvd should not skip the audio!!! The movie itself is one that will want to be owned by many.
5,Excellent!,First time seeing it. Saw The Dark Knight Rises and wanted to see how it all began and loved it.
3,"Erroneous Amazon Info, Won't Play on Some SONY BD Players","First, there is no Japanese language track and only Japanese or Chinese subtitles, not both. (I'm not sure which subtitled language is listed because I don't read either language, but I suspect it's Chinese because some of the characters are much more complex than most Japanese characters.)Also, IF YOU OWN A SONY BLU-RAY PLAYER THIS DISC MAY NOT PLAY! I sold a perfectly fine Batman Begins BD to a guy with a Sony player who fantasized that the disc was filthy or heat damaged, neither of which were true. Only after he bought a 2nd BB BD and discovered that it, too, would not play in his Sony BD player did he realize the problem was his player, not because I was some sort of scheister, which I'm not.[...]After the guy returned the disc to me it played (and is playing now) perfectly fine in my PS3."
4,Not Your Typical Summer Blockbuster Thug!,"With powerful direction, a mixture of elegant performances and a dash of just enough special effects, this truly is a beginning worth remembering. While some moments lead this viewer to think corn was about to be popped right off the ear, the action quickly deviates into a darker alley that allows one to savor the moment of a deep breath. No brightly light faces, no one-liners to dilute the plot, and a ensemble cast human enough to understand without gulping down soda in vile disgust. Hopefully if there are future cards to be laid, and the jester shows his hand, this darker franchise will continue to satisfy without sacrificing itself to mockery ."
5,just wow,"This movie was good, and the second one was even better. The third one was a piece of poop though"
5,The bat is back!!!!,"When Batman & Robin hit theatres in June of 1997, it single handedly buried the Batman franchise. The characters, writing, directing, acting, and plot were so bad, that fans went into shock. With Batman Begins, director Christopher Nolan has gone back to basics, jettisoning both the silliness of the TV incarnation and the gothic and fetishist elements of the '90s version. This is a hard-core, down-and-gritty origin story - the tale of, as one might reasonably expect, how Batman begins. It isn't intended as a ""prequel"" to the 1989 film, not only is Gotham City a completely different place, but key events of the Batman chronology are re-spun. Batman Begins is designed as the start of a new life, a reboot for the franchise. In the process, Nolan has not only crafted the best Batman movie, but arguably the second-best motion picture superhero narrative. Through every inch this film shows how Batman got his cool gadgets and his fighting style. Can't wait till this goes on DVD."
5,Great Movie with Unique Style,"BATMAN BEGINS, the latest in a number of films featuring the caped crusader, reimagines the character in a way that previous films have not. Christian Bale's Batman is a more nuanced individual, avoiding the caricatures of previous incarnations. Michael Caine is terrific as Alfred, young Bruce's loyal butler turned guardian/friend. Liam Neeson, Gary Oldman and Katie Holmes round out the cast in fine fashion.The plot flows well, the visuals and sound effects are first rate and there are few dead spots."
2,The Bat Has Lost It,In This Batman Was Not Very Good Maybe it was because the villian was an idiot with a moth mask on and gased everyone to see ilussions hopefully the next batman with the joker as the villian will be better i heard it comes out june 2007 with spiderman 3 and superman
1,"Wont play on my ""samsung bd-p1400","I was really looking forward to this title on blu ray, I already own the dvd, But it wont play on my player which is less that a year old. Buyer beware!"
3,So-SO....,"Thinking about this movie, all that I could do was backtrack to the earlier, more fun Batman installments that we have seen, starting with Batman (1989). Thinking back, I can remember how fun that film actually was to watch, so I thought that this one would offer up some of the same action packed material that the other ones did....WRONG!!This story does deliver what the title says, Batman Begins...which shows us exactly how the Batman character came to life. Other than a few fight scenes, this movie is more of a dialouge film than anything...is this for kids??? Yeah, the comatose ones...if you have a child that is into action, and just plain out fun like the other Batman's had to offer, then this one is not for them. If they have a true interest in the Batman character, and I mean a true interest, then yes, this one they will appreciate....I am not saying that this film is BAD in anyway, but be warned, I am sure that it is not what you think it will be...."
5,Superb DVD!!!,"The movie was awesome!! I think that goes without saying.Love it in wide screen blu-ray 10 times more though. If you can get this and Dark Knight both, do it. It will make for one fantastic movie watching experience."
3,Not a bad movie but.....,This was not a bad movie. It just isn't a great movie either. My 5.5 year-old son lost interest in it quickly and I found it a little boring and predictable. Once again a movie that didn't live up to its hype.
5,a new beginning yes indeed,i was hesitant to see this film because the past batman movies never impressed me- actually they destroyed batman in all previous attempts. They really did. With low expectations I finally did see this one. Excellent film. Wish I saw it sooner. Forget completely batmans of the past and enjoy this new beginning. Very good. 5 stars for washing away the bad taste of previous batman flicks.
3,Batman: YEAR ONE,"Easily the darkest version of Batman thus far.And it takes the cake when it comes to scares. What were the BBFC (UK Censor Board) thinking with the ""12A"" rating? This qualifies for a ""15"". Head-buts, kicks, bones breaking, faces becoming twisted and contorted, demons taking shape, etc. Gothic stuff indeed!However, I have a horrible feeling the film has been cut. There were a number of sudden cuts and these edits looked very ropey...As a film, it's a vast improvement on the farcical sequels of Tim Burton's original. However, some of the designs are rather weak - the costume remains a rubber-suit. Why-oh-why couldn't they use the type of design seen in the live-action short film - Batman: Dead End?The performances are spirited, the film has a punchy pace and the music is sweeping and graceful.However, after 140mins, I felt empty and unfulfilled.It was good but it lacked the zest and passion of the comic-books."
1,"Buyer Beware - Great movie, but possible bad batch.","First things first. Batman Begins the movie rules. Great cast. Great director. More than makes up for the dreck that Joel Schlockmaker did with the series. I loved it. Why the one star, you ask? Because the the two-disc special edition I received as a gift, that was ordered through Amazon, has two major flaws. First, the second disc (the extras disc) doesn't load at all. Not on my DVD player, not on my PS2, not on my PC. I get the FBI warning, the Warner Brothers logo, then squat. Second, it didn't come with the special 72-page book that I heard so much about. All I got in mine was the obligatory Warner Brothers catalog of Batman Begins merchandise ($125 for a sterling silver Batmobile keychain???) and a Batman Begins branded flyer for Norton Antivirus (don't ask...I didn't even give it a second glance). That's it. Tomorrow I begin the process of trying to get Amazon to replace it. If it goes well, I'll update this review accordingly."
4,good batman but not great,"i think this movie good it,s has it,s flaws bale batman ,s was better than batman forever and batman robin but this movie put,s more foucs on the comics than the batman himself the blade movies were much better. bale batman wasn,t bad but it wasn,t great. a minor comeback for DC comics it,s better the batman films that before it,s even better than superman returns because christian bale is minor star he,s not a list like the people who played batman before him. keaton was a household or become household name when he played batman i think this movie a good step bale to help his career he did me forget about superman returns . one thing he had right or this movie the joker kill did not batman pranets like in the frist batman movie ."
3,Torn about this movie...,"I liked it, but I can see how some may find it boring. The beginning dragged on WAY too long. And the effects were SO LOUD. Maybe that was a movie theater problem, but I had to cover my ears during all of the action scenes.Katie Holmes served no purpose, and Cristian Bale was a really good Bruce/Batman. I have always liked him.I cannot 100% recommend this movie, but in a few months, it may be worth a rental from BB or Hollywood."
2,BATMAN BEGINS TO BORE,"Overly long, pretentious, and Liam HAM Neeson sounds like he's giving a zen lecture at an agricultural college. Fight scenes? Plenty of them, but you don't really see anything being done. Worst choreographed fight scenes--if this is a new Oscar category, this movie should win it. Background of Batman looks like a ripoff of the origin of Dr. Strange mixed with Magnus Robot Fighter (Remember that one?) Some interesting stuff with the effeminate looking badguy shrink with his ""bag"" of tricks, but Batman himself looks like he'd fit in better as ""Fire Island Man."" This picture could have been a lot more than what it is, but it isn't. Still, if you like seeing gravity defied, the laws of physics ignored, and a pretty boy trying to look mean behind a mask, watch this dvd with your hand on the fast forward button."
2,"Weak, choppy fights, bad dialog, some good SFX","It is an average action movie. People that give it 5 starssubmit to mass hypnosis. Fight scenes are very choppy andugly shot - Chris Nolan could learn a thing or two frommovies like ""Hard-Boiled"" or even ""Kungfu Hustle"".Dialog is juvenile and boring. Parts of the plot areutterly ridiculous - as a boy Batman was scared of bats sonow he travels to Tibet to confront his fears. Cinematographyis pretty good - that and few SFX saves that movie - otherwiseit is pretty empty shell of action movie."
2,BATMAN ENDS,"Batman Begins is not better than Tim Burtons 1989 epic. One reason is that this movie takes its self to seriously, There is no sence of adveture or fun. Batman begins may have taken what was missing frrom the old movies but he forgot to give us the colors, the fun dialoge and the joy of Batman here we have a scary, dark drama. I perfer the first two"
5,Excellence!,Such a great reboot! Looks excellent on BluRay! Well worth the price of admission! Do not miss out! Pick it up today!
3,It doesn't measure up to the previous movies,"This movie shows us how Batman begins and how Bruce Wayne became the Caped Crusader and it is an impressive film with an impressive cast from Michael Cane to Tom Wilkinson. Unfortunately, it fails to measure up to the summer blockbuster, Star Wars- Revenge of the Sith, by the best movie of 2005. Sure, I saw Batman Begins twice and I enjoyed the movie but Christian Bale doesn't have the appeal of George Clooney or Michael Keaton. By the far worst actor to play Batman would be Val Kilmer in Batman Forever because he lacked the maturity of George Clooney and Michael Keaton.Batman Begins is a good movie but fails to measure up to Star Wars- Revenge of the Sith."
3,fall short of my expectations,"I'm looking forward to see the visual quality the same like as ""Casino Royal"". But, this film has fallen short of my expectations. The qulity of visual is so little bit better than DVD. But,""Dark Night"" trailer would be help soothe my nerves. This trailer has a very shrpness and excellent visual side. So, I look forward to wait the release of ""Dark Night"".Anyway, This film has a ordinary sound, visual and so on.If you would be a crazy BATMAN fan, you must be purchase this title. But, If you were not, I would not recommand to buy this disc."
5,Great movie,"I ordered this movie used, but it didn't matter. It was in good condition and far less expensive than buying it new. A good movie, but I liked the 2nd one better. We'll see what the 3rd one has to offer..."
3,The movie is great,"But the service from Amazon is terrible. The movie starts and stops and there were long periods of ""loading"" or where it just shut down and pushed us back to the main menu. I love Amazon -- but their streaming is terrible. Stick with Netflix for this one."
1,"Sounds like a good idea, but....","I bought this toy for my son for Christmas. I had bought some of the ""trucks"" and wanted him to have Bob and Wendy too. I found this set and thought it would be great. They ONLY good thing about this set is that he has Bob and Wendy.The clicking blocks sound like a great concept, but they don't work. If you can get them to click you are lucky. You can not build anything with this set. The box shows a house, buildings, etc., but you can't build these thing because the magnets are in the wrong places and the roofs make the whole thing top heavy!I would avoid this set unless you just really need Bob and Wendy (like us)."
4,Transparent and Warm,"There are times when I believe I would be satisfied to hear only the music of Bach for the rest of my life. Adding to the variety of Bach's music is the variety that can be found in the ways that it is arranged. Here, for example, we have the famous Goldberg Variations played not on a keyboard, but by a small string group with bass and harpsichord continuo. I was skeptical at first, but was soon won over by the convincing playing and the superb quality of the recording, which combines transparency and warmth. In every way, this is a first-class production and an extremely rewarding experience for the listener. If you enjoy the music of Bach, you will enjoy this recording, and I recommend it highly."
1,"another copy of ""The Last Concert""","This is the same DVD as Rod Stewart & the Faces - The Final Concert. It's the one with Keith Richards in it.THIS IS NOT A NEW DVD.If you enlarge the photo you can see that someone cut and pasted the WRONG people at their instruments. Ronnie Wood is playing the keyboards, Kenny Jones is playing the bass, and the late Ronnie Lane is playing the drums. In fact, Lane is not even on this DVD, Tetsu is."
4,Bicycle Display Stand,"The price is right and the holds the bike for repair, cleaning, or just parking. Does not hold the bike very tight but for the novist repairman, it is great."
5,LIVE ON!!!,"I recently saw sloan with jet. When Sloan played a better show than jet did(and jet rocked), I decided to check them out. This is the first sloan album i have bought. The entire album is great, my favorite tracks are live on, ready for you, and fade away. Sloan reminds me of the beatles, all four of them sing, they even sound like the beatles at times, but heavier. The bassist plays guitar, the guitarist plays bass, the lead singer/guitarist plays drums and the drummer sings/plays guitar. They are unbelievable musicians, and i plan to own their entire catalog in a short time. BUY THIS ALBUM!!!"
1,STOP think don't do it,"Don't use this crap in a newer engine. My 03 Nissan has been going through oil. I put this into my car and within 5 miles, failure. Car stalled and would barely run. Had to have the oil & filter changed including diagnostic time $85 shot."
5,"Very, very good book.","I did not agree with everything Manis writes, but his message is so very true. I hope this book start a trend!Manis' platform is one of faith in people and their ability to be good. That is a springboard to all kinds of improvement - and intimacy an sexuality is an area we can all improve in.Well deserved Five Stars."
2,Disappointing,"Firstly, I found this cream to have an odd smell to it. Secondly, it moisturizes well but not as well as I had anticipated and hoped.This product was disappointing and I do not plan on repurchasing. There are other products from NeoStrata that I love but this definitely is not one of them!"
3,"The ring is nice, but different from the picture","The ring I received is very nice, but it looks quite bit different from what is pictured. The ring on the picture looks carved on a polished background where the Celtic Knot is contiguous. The ring I received is laser etched with several independent Celtic Knots in groups of 4. So nice ring, but not as advertised."
3,Good for Light Use,"The Good: Affordable, versatile, easy to use.The Bad: Tore at the seam were the vest secures to your body, the weight sits at your abdomen, bounces when used during runs"
1,Bad tv movie,"This movie plays as if it was directed by the camera.It looks cheap is hopelessly incoherent.Stick with ""Close Encounters""."
3,the movie itself is worth seeing,"it sounds like they did a pretty crummy job transferring this film to dvd but i must put two cents in for the film itself. i think all the actors are wonderful and the trippy look and feel are appropriate and fun. the production of the play by Nick Bottom and the 'rude mechanicals' is laugh-out-loud funny. very much worth seeing, in my opinion. plus it features the young and lovely helen mirren, the young, lovely and naked judi dench, miss peel from The Avengers and the guy who gets his head cut off in The Omen. i give the film 4 stars, subtracting one for the poor quality of the transfer (that i've read about)."
1,Exceptionally Poor Quality Reproduction,"The 1968 BBC performance of ""A Midsummer Night's Dream"" was terrific. Unfortunately, as others have noted by others here, the quality of this reproduction of that performance is abysmal. Absolutely abysmal. THe color is uneven and faded, and the sound uneven as well. It is most unfortunate that this fine production by a sterling cast should be so degraded in this edition. This is a movie which really is in want and need of a proper treatment.This version is not such a treatment."
1,Not even really ProTouch,"I ordered a ProTouch keyboard protector from amazon for a macbook pro. I received a cheap, no name brand clear rubber keyboard cover for a macbook white. it came in a bag that said ""Wireless Accessories"" on it. that's all it said. the same bag that the no name brand cell phone cases come in. certainly not a presentable package. I was displeased to say the least, and no company name was available for me to ship it back to, or exchange."
5,PURE GENIUS,"You can still see the lighted buttons and it prevents dirt and dust from getting inside the Mac. When it gets dirty or sticky I just wash it with soap and completely dry it then put it back on. Good investment for a $4,000 Laptop. YOU SHOULD BUY THIS PRODUCT."
4,Good protection from sticky fingers,"Overall, I like the protector. Other people have said it protects the keyboard from spills. While I can't vouch for that particular capability, I do think it protects the keys from sticky fingers. I like how it feels over the keys, too. I definitely would recommend this product."
2,Good but can't see the keys anymore,"This is a great idea, very useful to protect your keyboard. I think that computer companies should always integrate this kind of protection to the keyboard. Keyboard aren't cheap, and on laptops if you spill your coffee, your laptop is pretty much dead. So this comes in as an important piece of protection.Unfortunately in low light environment, especially when there's still enough light for the backlight of the keyboard to be off, you just can't see the keys anymore. Because of this issue, 1/2 of the time i'm not using the protection. The protection is very sticky on the side that goes against the keyboard, meaning that when you don't use it, it gathers a lot of dust very quickly, beating the purpose of having that ""skin"" on top of your keyboard.Another good idea, that really needs more thinking, as to what material should be used so that it's fully transparent."
1,Cannot recommend - it stains my laptop screen,"As a keyboard protector, it works fine.Unfortunately, the material seems to interact with the LCD display to leave marks.It has stained my screen with rectangles (one from each protected keycap).Water does not completely remove the marks on the screen - they appear to bepermanent."
4,"Chirstian ""Death"" Metal","Yes my friends of this great indstry, this is one of theworld's finest albums of the decade 1990. For so long metalhas been classified in a devilish class of its own. But to bringlight in this world of maddness, this group does indeed bring""spiritual healing"" in there heavenly ""dark"" sound! this groupdoes not exist anymore, so anything that you buy of this bandis a collector's piece! Don't delay on the purchase of this foryou will miss out on a treat. If you are in to dark and evilsounds, but do go to church, you need to get this gift fromGOD, for this is your album filled with the truth. If you arethe other guy, still don't miss out on some good music!!Big Nutt"
4,superfast pop-punk,"These guys list bands like the Ramones, Descendents, Jawbreaker and Metallica as influences. And they're all there. But mainly the Ramones and Descendents. The music is fast - unbelievably so - but never loses the melody. Songs are about being dumped - the topic of some of the greatest songs ever. And hey, you've got to love a band who writes a power ballad and actually calls it 'Power Ballad'. Buy it."
3,This book shouldn't have gone past the short story phase.,"If you have any sort of sexual imagination of your own, I suggest you explore it instead of wasting your money on this second rate stuff. Once you get past the tedious ""getting to know you"" stage, your treated by some typical bondage, master/slave, submission, pain stuff; an affluent woman being taught the ways of a master. The thing is so contrived, it seemed created by some computer program. The author (whomever he or she really is) throws in some literary references in a feeble attempt to make the character seem like cultural sophisticates (sort of the way the writers of ""Frazier"" did, but at least the TV show was lots of fun. My advice: if you need to read this book,you probably spend a lot of lonely evenings in bed, so you should get yourself a more creative sex life."
1,i'm sure i'd love it if i didn't have to read it for school,I think the subject says enough. I'm sure I'd love it if I didn't have to read it for school. I only dislike this book because I have to write an in-class essay for it tommorrow. it's too annoying and i hate the point of view because it's something to be discussed. I'm ure I'd love A Seperate Peace if I didn't have to write an analysis of Finny and Gene's relationship. damn school.
1,Waste of Time,"Weak characters all around, but most especially Gibbons' portrayal of men. Plot had potential...but it never went anywhere worthwhile. Next."
5,A Wonderful Story,I loved this book. It was the first book i have read by Kaye Gibbons and it certainly will not be my last.The story centers on a turn of the century midwife and follows her life to the end.The granddaughter is telling the story. I could not put the book down. It totally captivated me.The title is certainly a story in itself. It did not mean what I had predicted.You shouldn't miss the one. It is great!
5,An emotional story told with sensitivity and grace,I've had this book for a while and just got around to reading it. I should not have waited so long! This story has a truly wrenching conflict and great realism in its depiction of the heroine. I love this author's writing style. Thumbs way up!
5,Love It!,"If you've never understood God's acceptance and grace fully, this is a book you would definitely benefit from! McCallum obviously put a lot of thought into how he could make these deep truths easier to understand and apply. Personally, I love the tables sprinkled throughout this book. They do so much to make things clearer, and are a great resource for group bible studies!!Some of the many tables found in this book:<> Comparing Biblical and Modern Love<> How the Means of Growth (Prayer, Word, Fellowship, Ministry) work together and affect one another.<> Our Old Self (in Adam) vs. Our New Self (in Christ)<> Living under the Law vs. Living in Grace"
1,Not realistic in the least,"If the producers knew anything about Deaf Culure they would have picked an actual deaf actress to play the role. It is not only offensive but is not even remotely realistic in showing what deafness and deaf culture is like. It only shows a helpless deaf girl who magically hears after getting a cochlear implant. Come on. It takes 3 months to heal after the surgery and even get the thing turned on and then years of speech therapy etc for it to be successful, IF its even successful. The actor was cute, I'll give them that much but isn't it time to let the Deaf act for themselves."
5,Amazing!!,This film FAR exceded my expectations. It takes you on an amazing emotional journey from start to finish. An excellent production and definitely a love story that youll remember! Great soundtrack too!
3,The Black Arrow,"The book I chose to read for my book report was the Black Arrow. The Black Arrow was written by R.L. Stevenson and was illustrated by Lionel Richards. The Black Arrow is a good historical fiction book that takes place during the English civil war against the Yorkists and the Lancastrians. The following paragraph will give you a short summary of the book I read.The story is about a knight named Dick who goes on an epic quest to find and destroy the group, the Black Arrows. It leads him to a forest and a victorious battlefield. This book would be best suited for people who prefer historical long fiction books. I thought it needed to be shorter and more easier for younger readers to understand"
3,The Big Album,"I'm gonna be straight, here. D.Z.'s ""Uneasy Street"" is a better album and the place to put your money should you buy some Zollo. For the die-hard Zollo fans, well, you're gonna buy it anyway and bless you all."
3,Not really LARGE PRINT,"This bible is a carbon copy of my NAB Student Bible. No problems with content, just that I would not call this a LARGE PRINT book, rather a Larger, or even a Medium print edition."
2,Never Get the Chance to Let Me down Again,Not able to tell from the packaging I regretfullypurchased this pricey deluxe edition only to findthe last four songs have been removed from the CD.Not ending with Pleasure Little Treasure makes thewhole nostalgic vaunt all vapid and hollow.Disc 2 contains the catchier more enjoyable tracksfrom the singles along with what I call the missingtracks although some would argue. Alas they can onlybe played on a DVD player not a car stereo. Kind of aworthless novelty albeit deliberate.
5,MFTM -- best Depeche Mode album,"I bought this album in 1987 and was utterly amazed by it. Each time I listened to it, I felt like I was being taken on a dark journey of images and places I've never known or seen before. I still remember how much I anticipted DM's next album ""Violator"" and felt slighty dissapointed with every other DM album thereafter because although they had some great songs, they never provided the journey that this album does. The only other album that comes close is Black Celebration. I have every single DM album and single on this planet but I'd have to say that this is the only one I pull up from time to time -- and love every second of the journey it takes me on."
5,Nice DTS,"This album always has been essential in a tecno pop collection and it reachs its madurity with the DTS mix.Gosh, it seems to listened to new a thing. I was so used to listen to this record with the originally hoarse sound. Like if you put your speakers facing to the floor. But now it's so clean so when you listen to it new sounds come up like if they never have been there before.Such a nice experience. Sit in middle of those 5 speakers and you won't regret it.There is only one thing I would have change. I now the originally lp press came out without the bonus tracks but, since everybody is used to the cd version, they should have put the whole tracks together and not separated, so in order to play them you have to get into a new menu.Enjoy it while it last."
4,Another good Depeche Mode CD,"Containing classics ""Never Let Me Down"" and ""Strangelove"", this is an album that has a number of more famous Depeche Mode tracks. A good buy if you like the style."
4,Good if your expectations are realistic,"For what it costs, it's a great little secondary setup. I chose to route line-level signals throughout my house instead of using a central amp. I use these for places like the garage, the patio, and the bathroom where I don't need big power or surround-sound. The patio amp in particular has many hundreds of trouble-free hours on it.I'd certainly buy one again if one of the three I have were to fail."
3,One flaw,The product works great but I wish you could select both A & B zones to play at the same time.
4,Audio cuts out constantly,"Bought this as an amp for a Sonos zone. Worked for 6 months, but now audio comes and goes. Too bad, because when it worked, it was perfect.Update: changed it to use Line 2 as the input, and it's working reliably, now. (Thanks Aleks.) There was probably something about that in the instructions, but I'm a leader, not a reader..."
4,Don't forget to buy the input cable!,"Good product so far - I'm not sure how I missed the fact that you need to have an audio RCA cable, but it was clear as day when I got it out of the box. With that little fiasco figured out, I've been completely happy with it. Thanks!"
3,Ok Amplifier - nothing special - ugly looking.,"It is ok; nothing special; it is pretty ugly; made in china;cheap make, and look; It is good for a basementor some room that no one will able to see it;Performance; ok; it should be 20 dollars;No more than that. It is for my cat to listenhis favorite radio show."
1,Misleading promotion,"I bought the AudioSource Amp 100 to replace a 30-year-old Harmam-Kardon that had died - I used it to make cassette copies of old phonograph records. The Amp100 does accept the signal from my turntable and pre-amp and puts the sound on the speakers, proving that there was nothing wrong with my system but the dead stereo amplifier. However, although the Amp 100 clearly has stereo output jacks, the signal there will not provide anything useful to the cassette deck. Way down in the fine print of the instructions I discovered that this ""output"" is referred to as a ""pass-through"", which apparently means it is unamplified. Phooey!"
1,BBB stop entering on our market such lemons!,"This product is a waste of money,everything meaning quality is ZERO in this AudioSource product!I dispensed it!"
2,Too noisy,An annoying amount of hum and hiss comes from my speakers. The noise is still there without any inputs to the amplifier and it increases as I turn up the volume knob.
5,awesome,"it works great, it really does what it says its going to do. just get it if you want great sound."
1,Audio is always cutting out,"This would be a fine product except for the fact that it has this mechanism to cut sound output when the sound level falls below a certain threshold. There is a switch to turn off this ""feature"" but it doesn't work. The result is that the sound always cuts off when your music volume gets low. It's extremely irritating when you're trying to listen to the soft parts of songs or when you don't want to blast the output. I want control my volume via remote, buy I have to manually adjust the volume knob instead and when I don't feel like cajoling the amp, I just let the music periodically cut out but get irritated every time it does. I would not recommend this product as a result of this problem."
4,Plain and Simple and Works Well,I am using this amp to control a set of speakers in a different room from my receiver. It synchs well with my Harmony remote and so far I have not had any problems or unpleasant surprises. It's a plain vanilla component with few bells and whistles and so far does what it does well.I noticied the Amazon price has fluctuated over time so be mindful of that.
3,It's okay.......,"It's not a bad amp, but its input to output ratio is pretty low. I have it hooked up to my surround sound to feed my outdoor patio speakers. It works well enough but if I turn down the surround sound inside, and turn up the amp. Well the amp output isn't that great. It works, but I'm sure theres better out there."
1,Crapped out,"I have read all the reviews, before, and again after, since my unit crapped out...It lasted 6 months, light use. The signal went out via a audio mixer with 3 pairs of ceiling speakers, never used all at once, maybe two pair, and it just crapped out after 6 months. The fuse wasn't blown, the lights still came on, it just stopped working. I had my doubts on a $100 unit before hand and ummm and my doubts came true. I am looking at other brands now."
2,no review,"I didn't finish watching this feature because I couldn't get past the crappy audio. The vocals in this movie sound like the actors are talking into a large empty tin can, combine that with the UK accents I really couldn't make out what was going on, but half way through when I checked out all the characters had done was drive, get loaded and fool around.(There's two guys and two girls involved)"
1,Waste of money.,"I speak Chinese and naturally want to share that with my children. There were not many items out there when I began looking for DVDs, and this was featured (three or so years ago). This was a waste of money. It is not kid-friendly and doesn't even teach Chinese. Look for something else. This is as good as no DVD at all."
1,Incorrect title,"Okay, I did not buy this product. Nor will I. There has to be something wrong with the title of this video. If they mean little sister, then I think the correct pinyin form of it should be mei mei. Mimi means breast in Chinese. Are all the reviewers of this English only speakers, or has someone who actually speaks Chinese seen this video? I'm just curious if their pinyin is incorrect, then will their pronunciation of words be incorrect as well?"
5,"excellent product, clean and easy","I schedule it when I am not home. It cleans the floor automatically for you. After it is done, it just know how to go back to the home base to recharge. Sometime, it might be stuck in somewhere, but after 1-2 times try out and rearrange stuff. It works perfectly. Highly recommend it."
1,Uncomfortable pulsemeter,"While this unit may be as accurate as described, I nonetheless had to return it because it was an extremely uncomfortable, annoyingly intrusive fit on my wrist."
1,Not a good measurement,Mark of fitness MF-180 did not work. It did not pick my heart rate accurately no matter how many times I repositioned it. It was also uncomfortable. I do not recommend this for anyone who needs a reliable heart rate reading.
5,An inspiration to read the O.T for the first time 'again'.,"At first I was a little skeptical as to the soundness of the technique in the telling of the story because it took me by surprise to have an ancient Jewish story told in the modern vernacular. But Ms. Austin pulled it off, and I was intrigued. Her method of storytelling was an inspiration to go back and re-read the various books of the Old Testament.To be honest I did read all 5 of Lynn's books. I was engrossed with the first one and it was free. Amazon's marketing technique is a wonderful thing!"
5,loved this book!!!,"this was an incredible book, and I was so disappointed when I finished the last of the series. I absolutely love historical fiction, but this went so much further than just the typical entertainment I get from most books I read. I walked away with a stronger faith in the Lord and excitement for reading the bible as well! It made me want to call up the author personally and thank her for sharing her gift with others."
5,LOVED IT!,"I had a hard time putting this book down. I felt so involved in the story and the characters' lives. I cried at times. I loved how it has so many perspectives - political, religious, parental, marital. It's full of emotion and gives a great vision of how things were during that time....I absolutely loved reading it! I'm eager to continue the series!"
5,Loved this series!,This is one of my all time favorite book series! Loved everything about it and have referred it to many people who feel the same way. It put flesh to some of the people of the Bible and made me love the old testament even more. I can't recommend it enough!
3,Gods and Kings,"Gods and Kings, purchased from Amazon, seems to be an accurate novel interpretation of scripture. Detailed descriptions are graphic. Probably a good historic account of what took place during this period in Hebrew history."
5,Review of God's and Kings,"This is a 5 star book because the writing is excellent,very descriptive and exciting. I really was drawn to it because it is based on Biblical history. I have read about the kings but this made book it all real. I highly recommend this book to all readers but especially those who love ready the Bible and Biblical history."
5,J. Gaines & The Soul Attorneys: Back and Better than Ever,"This CD is definitely going in my shopping cart! After their name change from ""Soul Attorneys"", Canadian J. Gaines has taken the group to a higher level of rock with ""Better Man"" and ""Happy Together""... my advice: Grab it before it's gone!"
2,Overpriced for basic information,"This book is really full of common sense, but if you are new to web businesses, it may be of help but not worth the price tag.Mr. Rudl's website has several ""ANNOYING"" pop-ups that made me want to leave immediately.There are a lot of common sense themes in the book that can be found on any web-based business site, and a lot of the information is out-dated in my opinion.There is one good thing about the book though, and that's that it puts a lot of information together that would take a while to get on your own.In my opinion, Mr. Rudl is a good salesperson with good marketing skills. He makes his money by hawking his wares on his site, and it looks like he makes money by being an associate for other websites with ""featured"" products on his website.I don't recommend this ""book""."
2,Overpriced and Overhyped,"I thought this book was carelessly written... His methods are that of a huckster, and his business model is of one who spams people. You'd have to be crazy to follow his suggestions for email advertising and followup! You'd lose your ISP faster than your head would spin.The book was full of links you can find anywhere on the Internet, and most of the places he tries to point you to are for programs he'll make a profit from.His website brags about how he's going to finish up work and jump into his expensive car and drive home. Not impressed. I was looking more for someone who honestly cared about my business.His newsletters are the same way. He does nothing but try to sell without really caring who he is helping.So what if he made 5 million on the Internet. It'll come back and bite him later."
3,Not the original,This tea is ok but it's not nearly as potent as the original product that was available 5-10? Years ago.
1,made me sick,"I was so hoping to love this product after reading some of the good reviews, however, these made me so nauseous and sick. i don't think i can ever drink tea again because of how sick these made me feel. It might have just been a reaction to my system, and my system only....but i'm throwing my box away!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! :o("
2,did nothing,"I got the tea fast, and followed the instructions, only drinking 1/2 cup, which had no effect on my system, it taste pretty good though."
5,The Love from Hell/Agatha Raisin Series,"I got hooked on this series when I was convalesing and then went on line to buy more of the series. I could read it in a day and I love Agatha. She's a 50's something retiree who sticks her nose in everything. Can I identify, well, yes! She's really quite lovable and his men attracted to her intelligence and her legs. Go on, read it!"
2,"Poor Agatha, poor reader....","I've read every book in the series as well as the H. MacBeth series.I haven't finished this title yet but agree with other reviewers regarding the lack of proofreading. I was even stymied as to why this book would be listed under ""Women-detectives-England-NORFOLK and not Glous. or Warwickshire.""A.R. and the Love From Hell is a bit darker than the others in the A.R. series and so far (up to p. 172) there is no humor at all."
4,A FAVORITE OPERA,"I can't figure out why in the world this opera isn't done on a regular basis. The Metropolitan has Dolora Zajick on its roster who has sung the title roll in opera houses all over Europe but not the Met. Let's get a production going for her before she retires to her farm house in Reno. As fas as this 1971 production goes, I can't tell if it's in color or black and white with a blue tint. Either way, the picture is grainy. the sets are cheap looking and the lighting certainly wansn't done with video in mind. On the positive side we have the great Fiorenza Cossotto and the great Alfredo Kraus who make this DVD worth the purchase price. Their scenes together(especially in acts three and four) are vocal dynamite. For added excitement and great old fashioned Italian singing we have Sesto Bruscantini and Ruggero Raimondi with Olivero de Fabrities in the orchesta pit. We may get a better production and picture of FAVORITA in the future, but nothing will surpass ths singing on this disc."
3,Five Faces of Boredom,"I searched very long, and very hard to find this movie, andeventually found it... I watched it once, and it wasgood. Not nearly as good as the movie, but good. Subsequentviewingschanged my opinion. This is, without a doubt, one of the MOST BORING Transformers episodes EVER. The animation is, like most post movie episodes, not good when compared to the rest of the series. Don't get me wrong it isn't all that bad, though.The story is ambitious, to say the least, but it had a few little holes. Not to mention the annoyingness of Wheelie and Blurr. However, this episode is not entirely bad. The story is good, and there are some nice tie-ups of loose ends from the movie, but there are just some glaring annoyances that make this episode less than it could have been..."
3,A B Movie at Best,"I thought RoboCop 3 was just OK. I loved the first one. It was great. RoboCop is my all time favorite Movie ever made. I think the Robo trilogy is the best. I watch them often. But the problem with 3 is they got rid of Nancy Allen and he flew. RoboCop wasn't meant to fly. I liked the new arsenal he had in this film, but nothing compares to his old fashioned killer gun. They tried to copy the first one with the music and some of the dialogue. Also the humor was good some parts were funny. I think that kid was too smart. Be that i am a die hard RoboCop fan, I think this is worth owning and watching on DVD. The sound is incredible. I wouldn't recommend the average movie buyer to get this, but I would reccomend this to all Robofans. I thought the series was great!"
3,A More Cleaner Version of Robocop.,"Robocop (Robert John Burke replacing Peter Weller) quits being a Cop for the OCP, after losing his Long-Time Partner (Nancy Allen) killed by the Company. Now, he joins the Rebellion for the Rights of the Civilans of Detroit and to Fight, the OCP.Directed by Fred Dekker (Night of the Creeps) made a Light Entertaining Sequel but this is a wrong movie!. What`s missing in this Sequel is the Film Violence and the Sense of Humor in the First-Two Films. This was an Box Office Disappointment in Theaters but maybe fans of the series will like this last sequel of the Series. Grade:B."
1,One of the most boring Movies and kiddish movies yet.,This Movie sucked the acting was poor and the jet pack well look at it like this why would a cop need a jet pack a kid of about 6 would think something like that is cool and his new gun was okay but I love the little automatic pistol he used it looked and sounded cool but of course since I liked it that ninga had to cut in half with a super sharp sword take some advise that is good and watch the first one.
2,Big NO,"Although this has a better story than Robocop 2, there still isn't anything special about it. Totally forgettable. Appealing only to 6yr. olds who have real low attention spans. It also lacked violence, the key ingredient from the first two."
1,"Do robots yawn? Probably , if they watch this.","Oh woe, here we go with xenophobia. Evil, satantic Japanese baddies seek to take over Robocop's home city with the help of some rather melodramatic and frankly tedious robotic ninjas.The first Robocop was an excellent and moving film. By now the series has lost all its magic and vitality and is no more than people fighting. Somebody seems to have had the idea of making this one for younger viewers, so it's all very tame compared to its predecessors and relies heavily on flashbacks to the first (and superior) film.Uninspiring, dull and overblown. Don't bother with this film. You'll only encourage them to make a Part 4 and drag the character of Robocop down to even greater depths."
1,POOR ATTEMPT FOR A ROCK ALBUM,"EVERYTHING ABOUT ALBUM MAKES ME WANNA GRAB A GUN AND SHOOT MYSELF. THAT'S HOW BAD IT IS. IT'S LACKS EMOTION, AND IT SOUNDS FORCED. LIKE THEY ARE TRYING TO HARD TO SPREAD THE WORD INSTEAD OF TRYING TO MAKE GOOD MUSIC. EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS CD IS SO GENERIC, SO DULL, SO PREDICTABLE. ONLY A MORON WOULD THINK THIS IS A WORTH WHILE CD TO LISTEN TOO."
5,Great homeschooling book,"This is an easy to use, easy to understand grammar book. It has lessons lined out and answers are conveniently located in back."
4,Interesting and informative,"I've been enjoying this book very much. It's straight-forward, helpful and interesting. He gives very good tips about ghost hunting without a lot of the drivel that can accompany books of this type. I recommend it, especially to beginners."
1,There are better ways to spend $10,"Reading this book is a waste of time, buying it is a waste of money. It contain only very basic information, author thinks he's some kind of a all-knowing investigator, yet his orb photo is a mistake, literally, it's just a reflection.This books is more for self-promotion of author, than for providing information to people interested in becoming paranormal investigators, sorry. It will be better for you to invest additional $8 and buy this:Ghost Hunter's Guidebook: The Essential Guide to Investigating Ghosts & Hauntings"
1,VERY outdated,"The first half of this book is stories of the Authors own ghost hunts. Has nothing to do with ""How to be a ghost hunter"" as the title implies. Book needs a serious update. Author refers to using audio tapes. No mention of digital recorders. All the limited information contained in this book is readily available on the internet for free. If you are looking for information on how to start ghost hunting, this is NOT the book to use. Very little ""how to"" in this book."
3,Could be better,"Other than an typo or two, this book isn't bad, though a lot of it is stating the obvious. It is excellent for those first starting into the hobby, and somewhat entertaining just for paranormal enthusiasts. Interesting cover and photographs as well."
1,Really Disappointed.,"The chain is so thin and flimsy, I'm afraid that if I wear it I'll lose it. I think that it might fall off of my neck. Years ago, I had a similar chain that did that, but I only paid about $6.00 or $7.00 for it. It was sterling silver, too. And, the whole necklace is so little and scarce. The way that it was made to look in the adverisement made me feel like I was really getting a good deal. Instead, I feel like I got taken. I thought that the chain would at least be thicker and stronger--I mean, for $30.00. If I could've seen the actual chain before buying it, I wouldn't have paid more than $10.00 for it."
1,sorry,i never get the item but was my fault i order to other adress sorry but i guess is a good product
5,Girlfriend,My girlfriend absolutely loved this. She really isn't a jewelry person and is very hard to pick stuff out for but she wears this constantly. Its smaller than I imagined it but I think that is why she liked it so much. She has gotten a lot of compliments while wearing it.The chain did end up breaking but it was her fault and not really a product defect she took her shirt off while it was still on and the chain got caught on her shirt as she did that and snapped. Just bought a replacement chain and she is wearing it all the time again.
2,looks cheap,I bought this pendant because was nice in the picture and also had a 50% discount but in reality looks very cheap the chain is very thin and fragile...
2,My first young readers book,"I found the book interesting. However, tapping on the screen continually so that I could read the print and then tapping again to see the illustrations was very annoying. Also there is a page in the middle where the sentence doesn't end but the next page begins a whole new sentence."
4,Above decent,"I flipped through this book at the local shop and thought it might be a good buy. What I found inside was actually pretty insightful. One thing though, this book is not an instruction on how to draw. So if you're not familiar with drawing fundamentals I'd suggest an instructional book instead.This book contains all the basic ins and outs of creating manga utilizing digital means. From inking to coloring and including different types of color work it's pretty extensive and is a great book for beginners who don't exactly know programs like Photoshop or Illustrator but are eager to learn.Definitely a good surprise and it even goes into the publishing side of the business which is always good for those who want to work professionally."
4,call me a late-bloomer,"most of you have probably had this album for a while now, and loved it for a little longer than that. it's superb, and groundbreaking, and accessible, and complex, and bizarre, and all the other titillating adjectives you hear people apply to bjork and her music. this, i think, may be her most enjoyable album, very cohesive and sturdy, with nary a weak link to be found. but then again, i haven't listened to all that much bjork in my lifetime. i've found that i take her best in smallish doses."
4,Clasic Bjork,One of her best upbeat likeable/listenable products. Creative without being too far out there. Classic Bjork.
1,Worst and least favorite Shakespeare; boring to the nth degree,"My least favorite Shakespeare--long, tedious, boring and highly distasteful. Didn't catch my interest whatsoever; this was the first Shakespeare I read that I seriously had to force myself to continue and kept thinking ""enough already!"" Too drawn out and more difficult to read than his others. Stick withPericles Prince of Tyre (The Pelican Shakespeare)."
3,You're all missing the point...,"I think you're all missing the point (or a bunch of ringers from digireads.com). What we have here is the basic text derived a scanned version of the play, with no background information on how the text came to be. It's a decent enough interpretation, but with absolutely no editorial assistance to understand the language or the context in which the ideas of the author are set forth. Definitely better than nothing, though."
2,Outrageous bad bass,"There is an inconsistency. Either the reviews are terribly biased or my unit was not properly refurbished. The radio is potentially fantastic and worth a rating of 10 or five stars. However, the bass is absolutely unaccptable. Yesterday, I was playing the same station on my stereo and the Boston Acoustics Receptor. The difference was mind boggling. The bass on the Boston Acoustics Receptor drowned out the singer and the band. I was thinking of buying one or two more units until the bass really got on my nerves. Now, I won't buy another and won't recommend this radio to a stranger."
5,Take a chance on... Don!,"Everyone thinks that the music they listen to is great - And they'll tell you so... over and over until you break down and buy whatever piece of ka-ka it is they're so excited about. That having been said, make an exception and listen to ME...This is an original album by a truly exceptional artist. Don isn't ""off the beaten path,"" he's off it, beyond it and already over on the other side of the forest picking berries. What you'll hear are short, succinct, deliciously mundane and catchy pop tunes. The subject matter is ""everyday"" in nature but it always rings true because his observations and stories simply ARE true. When I first heard this CD, I was giggling the whole time. He's a master of subtlety - When he sings about how he pretended to like The Dave Matthews Band to get a girl you want to laugh, but you're too busy singing the chorus. Lennon is really on to something here, and if you ""get it,"" you'll have bought all three of his CDs by this time tomorrow."
4,Perfectly fine coffee maker,"I don't understand the bitter reviews of this machine. No bells or whistles, but it does what it's supposed to do just fine. If it's spewing coffee all over your kitchen perhaps you've done something wrong."
3,Good for Vegan... Limiting for Lacto-Ovo Vegetarian,"I wish they called this book ""Carb Conscious Vegan"". This is my personal preference, but I miss the eggs and cheese."
2,"Just another vegetarian cookbook, not helpful for raising protein","I have several go-to vegetarian cookbooks which have similar recipes. I was looking for recipes with more vegetarian protein sources, such as tempeh and seitan. There are only a couple with the former and the latter isn't even mentioned. Maybe my fault for assuming low carb equates to higher protein."
4,Almost as good as they say,"I have had two Ionic Breezes to help with family allergies for over a year and for the most part they work great. One stopped working and they sent a new one without my having to send back the broken one first! My complaint is that I have to clean the one in the living room at least weekly, rather than monthly as the company says. This may be because I live in New York City and keep the windows open, bringing in lots of dust. And I have a cat. Clean up is pretty simple and fast. The machine is indeed silent, it removes lots of dust and is inconspicuous. I think it improves the air quality quite a bit, of course, more when the windows are closed. It has helped a LOT with our allergies."
1,Air cleaners that do not clean the air,"According to Consumer Reports tests, the Sharper Image Ionic cleaners do not clean the air."
3,2 years and still running well,"I've had a unit running day and night for almost 2 years straight, it seems to work great and kills odors pretty well. Cleaning the fins is easy but notice that over time some parts are tougher to clean and keep clean over long period of use. The only thing wrong with my unit is that it runs great on the high setting but it shuts down by itself on the lowest setting. It doesn't matter to me since I just keep it on high all the time. I paid much less for mine after it had already became popular and went into its demise but mine's been well worth it."
5,Incredible,"It was incredible. I didn't think I had anger issues, however, I did learn a great deal about myself after reading this book. Once I was honest with myself. I really worked out many unresolved issues that I never dealt with before. I would encourage everyone to read these authors."
4,Outstanding,I think the key to this book is how interactive it actually is. Reminds me a bit like the old school work books which for myself were effective.
3,"OK, but stiff","Good for exfoliating, but this thing is stiff. Kinda hurts your back when you use it. Also the bristles are a bit long for my taste."
1,Junk,"I bought this because my wife had surgery and needed something to use in the shower to reach parts she couldn't bend to get to. The brush cannot handle water very well. It started to get funky and peel and became useless within a month. I guess if one completely dries it off after every use and hangs it in the open air to continue drying, it might last longer and be useful. If you hang it in your shower, though, it turns into some germ ridden piece of junk in no time."
3,great looking but easily rips,"I received my package within the stated time frame,but as I was putting it on (very carefully I might add), it still got about a two inch long rip on the stomach part. Will not be wearing this for halloween this year as if it rips with just putting it on then the costume I was going to wear over it would really shred it. My advice would be to buy something with a lot more spandex in it."
4,Wash,This turned out to be a great gift for Christmas time! I'm sure that it would be better to give in the middle of the summer when people are actually washing their vehicles.
4,"Broad, excellent overview, but will not please everyone","Like every treatment of the Arab Israeli conflict, this book will not please everyone (or anyone?). The book is brisk. Fortunately, Morris has an even tone throughout and does not remain fixed on any one subject for too long. As anyone knows who has written on a broad topic, this is an exceptional accomplishment. Even at 600 plus pages, this book could have easily gotten bogged along the way on the wealth of detail about this well researched conflict. And this book shows that despite some of Morris' more inflammatory interviews recently, he can still present a work of historical research that is even handed and fair."
4,good book,"it is a little boring talking about this book but it still gives you information about friendship. freindship is not just asking, ""would you be my friend?"" you need to know their characteristic and see if it suits you or not. true friendship is when friends help friends out, not just to burrow their video games"
1,Pathetic Design,"I've had the Mr. Coffee 4-cup switch (?) coffee maker for about a month, using it once or twice daily. The spring-loaded valve that enables ""Stop-n-Pour"" has fallen out 6 times. The plastic O-ring on the valve is beginning to break down. The pot is very difficult to put into or take out of the unit, requiring two hands. The pot leaks coffee onto the counter during the first pour, no matter how it is done. When the pot is taken out of the unit, coffee drips onto the heater plate, resulting in a scorched-coffee smell. It's hard to imagine how such a design failure made it into production. At $19.99, this is overpriced by about $19.98. A terrible piece of kitchen equipment."
4,Ionic Breeze Review,"I bought this product for the girlfriend, who happens to be be a smoker. Her car always smelled really bad, abviously. I purchased this to try and curb the smell and surprisingly, despite the small size of this product it works very well. Keeps the car smelling fresh even after being smoked in."
1,DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY,very bad item stopped working after 3 days now i need to spend time getting this item to be shipped back dont waste your money on this item
2,Don't take it apart and stick body parts inside the body of this beast!,"There is a little metal tooth thing inside this monkey that looks like it wants you to touch it, but if you pry the top off with a wrench and stick body parts in there to touch it, you better be grounded buddy because you're in for the ride of your life. This thing must have a 87 jiggawatt capacitor in there or something because I blacked out and didn't wake up for 4 hours after touching it, and it wasn't even plugged in at the time. I can't stop blinking lately either. Be careful when dissecting this little tazer-wannabe!!!"
4,Myrna Loy and William Powell Collection,"5 Stars = Best, 1 Star = BadManhattan Melodrama = 4 starsEvelyn Prentice = 3 starsDouble Wedding = 5 starsI Love You Again = 3 starsLove Crazy = 4 Stars"
1,Negative undertones,"This book scared me to death when I was pregnant. NONE of the terrible things it described happened to me. I feel it was also very one-sided. I agree the reviewer #1, The book made you feel bad ! Like being pregnant with twins was going to be a terrible experince, beware!The book was just so negative! I threw it in the garbage after I had the babies!"
2,"""Freightening"" and ""Far Out""","Noble's book is best summarized as ""frightening"" and ""far out."" Her thoughts on twinship experiences in utero sound like something out of the X-Files; her warnings against the evils of consuming dairy products and foods containing preservatives are pure paranoia; and the gorey details of multiple pregnancy hazards are nothing short of terrifying. In fact, the positive aspects of having twins are completely ignored. The only redeeming quality of this book would be the last 3-4 chapters dealing with prematurity and dealing with loss. However, this same content can be found in many other less frightening and definitely more positive books, such as ""Twins!"" by Agnew, Klein and Ganon."
1,"Run, Do Not Hide","While this book didn't scare me, I found it laughable and largely useless for the majority of twin-carrying women who like and trust their obgyns, believe that pain is generally to be avoided, and are actually comforted by the fact that institutions such as hospitals exist. Also, I found the book highly offensive in that it strongly suggested that miscarriage in twin pregnancies is caused by a mother's doubts about carrying twins. Gee, what a wonderful guilt trip to impose on a grieving mother..."
1,Don't Bother,"My husband and I found this book to be very antiquated. Since this is my first pregnancy and it's with twins, I was hoping for information about what to expect and what makes this experience different. While the book has some good information, it's very negative and spends a great deal of time talking about the risks of a multiple pregnancy and the odds of one dying."
2,Average romance,"Ms. Eschenburg takes the arranged-marriage plot device but doesn't really give it anything new. The ""hero"" really isn't that likable, and spends half the novel apart from the heroine. They end up together, but the reader is left wondering ""why?"" The author attempts to fill up the lack of real romance by setting the story against the American Civil War, but makes some mistakes with that as well, and child sexual abuse just flat does not belong in a romance novel AT ALL. That chapter nearly made me lose my lunch and it really didn't add anything to the plot. Not the worst ""romance"" I've ever read by any means, but definitely not worth the cover price. Buy used."
1,cancel order,I want to cancel this order before it ships. I think I would perfer to buy new. Please cancel order asap: James Dragg
5,Just what the doctor ordered,If you hate digital scales and their preset values (how is it that I jump between 189.2 and 189.6 back and forth exactly and never anything in between) then this is the scale for you.
5,Great ladder and extremely well designed and built!,"The 303 is a great ladder. It is top heavy when fully extended with the wall standoff and I'd recommend having two people when working with it this way. In all other cases, the ladder is very easy to work with and very easy to configure. The ladder is very solidly built and wobbled very little when fully extended. As an A-frame, it is rock-solid. It also stores easily, more easily than my ordinary six-foot ladder.The work platform is a must if you plan on using the ladder as an A-frame and want a place to rest a can of paint. It is designed to handle up to 300 lbs. and looks like it could handle more.For the average homeowner, I would stick with the 203 or 303. The 103 really is overkill for a non-professional and the extra weight I think would make it more of a hassle, especially with the wall standoff."
3,"side one great, side two not so great","strangely, the more'typical' fare on side two is a self-parodying abomination i.e.""Put Out the Fire"" while on side 1, ""Staying Power"", ""Back Chat"" and yes ""Body Language"" are exuberant and kickin', the band finding a new groove at last and clearly digging it to death, if you don't agree, then you deserve to sit in the back of a car singing ""Mamma mia let me go"" forever and stop there."
3,Not as bad as many seem to think,"Overall, this seems to be the most hated album by any major rock band I can think of. After listening to 1980's ""The Game,"" it hardly seems surprising that the band was moving into a more dance-oriented kind of music. This album also uses a lot more synthesizer, but Queen was certainly not alone in this in the '80s. ""Staying Power,"" the album's opening track, immediately lets you know this is not the same Queen you were listening to in, say, 1974. The album is not without good old-fashioned rockers however, including Brian May's ""Put Out the Fire."" I also happen to like the simple message of love and acoustic guitar in ""Calling All Girls,"" as well as the slinky ""Cool Cat,"" which features Freddie singing falsetto throughout. And it does include at least one bona fide Queen classic, ""Under Pressure."" I'd say give it a chance, and judge it on its own merits."
2,Cold Space,"I saw the tour of this ""album"" as a GI stationed at Lindsey AS Germany in 1982. They played two songs from this CD; first they played ""Under Pressure"" which the crowd went nuts for. Then they played ""Body Language"" and I swear the crowd went stone quiet. Needless to say, the band didn't play another song from this album. I only give this review two stars because ""Under Pressure"" is when of the best songs they have ever written. Other then that, like my German friends in 1982, I find this to be awful. The worst in their glorious career."
1,Still Stinking After All These Years,"I was fortunate enough to see Queen in concert 19 times during their touring days in the US, up to and including their last tour in this country in support of this piece of garbage album, Hot Space.I find it amusing reading reviews here from people who actually think it's good! I remember clearly when this album came out, how despised it was. I never met a fan of the band who liked it then, even at the concerts.Yes, this one album single handedly destroyed Queen's career here in the US, from which they would never recover. Queen never toured the states again, yet they remained tremendously popular around the rest of the world. They still made alot of good music after this diatribe of stank.Now over 20 years later....I STILL hate this album. It's awful.To the dude who thinks this junk is brilliant because it is a chick magnet, rock on, dude. It's just too bad that you don't know what Queen were all about."
2,"the ""black sheep"" of the catalog...","if you asked Queen fans in the States the reason for the band's decline in popularity here, alot of 'em will cite Hot Space as the reason...the band did lose more than a few long-time fans with this one, and in fact the tour for the album would ultimately be Queen's last in the USA. Many of the tracks aren't bad per se, but often they're experimental to a fault...and in many instances, the ""human"" element is upstaged by synths & beats. With the exception of a handful of tunes, Hot Space is a far cry from the days when Queen proudly boasted ""No Synthesizers!"" on their albums. I might recommend this for completists, but first-timers should probably avoid this for now. However, if you want to hear proper versions of these songs, check out Queen's Live At The Bowl CD or DVD...""Staying Power"", ""Action This Day"" and ""Back Chat"" are actually powerful in raw form, unlike the techno vibe in the studio."
2,Under Pressure and little else,"If you're just getting into Queen's music, then I would avoid this album if I were you. There's a good reason Queen's popularity went down the tubes in the US, and it's called Hot Space. Hard to believe this album followed the smash hit The Game and preceded The Works, another strong album. But it did, proving that even the great rock bands slip up now and then.The best song on Hot Space is by far Under Pressure, the collaboration with David Bowie. That's the only reason this album gets 2 stars in my rating. Staying Power isn't that great, but not terrible. Body Language is awful; just a hard song to listen to. The other songs are just as bad.If you really want a Queen CD with Under Pressure on it, buy Classic Queen or one of the box sets. Avoid this album. You'll be glad you did."
1,The undisputed low point in Queen's history,"If you're a Queen fan and you need a complete collection, or if you must have an original recording of ""Under Pressure"" (the only listenable song on the CD), then go ahead and buy it. But the rest of ""Hot Space"" is so completely awful, so completely un-Queen, that it makes you wonder if it was an intentional joke, as the early tracks on ""A Night at the Opera"" were. If you don't fit into one of the two categories listed above, avoid at all costs."
5,Wonderful Collection,"I had enough of a balance on a gift card for one CD. After listening to samples of selections from Liona Boyd, Ana Vidovic, Susan Isbin and Martha Masters, I came across this one. I listed to the samples over and over and finally ordered it, largely because I liked the sounds of the duet. Once I received the CD and played the selections all the way through, I think I made the right choice. This is a superb collection. These two ladies brilliantly blend melodies and harmonies, with a little dissonance thrown in here and there.I've had it for a few months now and it's still as fresh as when I first listened to it. You know sometimes when you get a new CD, you're hyped up on it and listen to it over and over, but then after a while it takes its place amongst the rest of your collection? Not this one for me. Whenever I need to wind down, this is the one I listen to and I haven't grown tired of it yet."
3,Pretty cool,A few songs are annoying and pedestrian but I dig the reggae track and a few others so I give this one a thumbs up for the right price.
5,Mando Magnifico,"Johnny Staats can just flat out PICK! His style owes a bit of debt to Sam Bush; in fact, there are several selections from this CD that remind one of the early, pre-Bela Newgrass Revival (Bush appears on track one, Scott Vestal's chromatic style picking is reminicent pf that employed by original Revival banjoist Courtney Johnson, and John Cowan is featured on most of the other tracks). But the combination of technique (Johnny loves to use pull-offs, which add snap and synchopation to the max), soul, and speed (""Escape from Taiwan"" will blow you away) make Staats a true original in the bluegrass/newgrass arena. And while Johnny's singing may seem a bit rough-hewn, it is authentic and heartfelt.This is the best debut bluegrass effort that I've heard in a long time - in its own way as fresh and exciting as the initial efforts of Hot Rize, Alison Krauss, and The Seldom Scene. Look out for Johnny Staats!!!"
5,ROFL and Get Money Smart!,"I bought this book in 1999 and read it annually. I always laugh out loud and recommend it to everyone I meet who is not and does not want to be an ""expert"" in the market but does want honest, forthright, expert advise on what's what in personal finance and investments. I re-read it recently and 10 years after it's release it's still dead on. I hope he updates it again soon cause the internet is even better than it was when he wrote this and there are even more investment ""schemes"" out there to AVOID!"
1,SO NOT WORTH THE MONEY....OR HASSLE!!,"I got this for my son.....bought it for $19.99 at the local toy store.Had I know what a pain it was, we would have never wasted the money!! I had to be the ""designated pumper"" because it was too hard for him to pump himself. We did not have a problem with the tube coming out, however, we have lost the rubber pc that goes on the tube, so now, the toy is worthless, and will not pump without the rubber piece.The water blaster is HEAVY, and straps are not stable. My son and his friends were to the point of NOT wanting to use it, b/c of the hassle it took to play with it. Even an adult would have to go thru as much trouble, so the age range is FAR off on this one!!Dont waste your money!!"
3,Not a good gift for a 1 yr old,"My son received this as a gift for his first birthday. He does not have the Tonka truck it would attach to. As a stand alone toy this leaves a lot to be desired. Although he is walking, this toy trips him up when he tries to push it along. Even at the lowest height setting it will end up completely verticle. The crane is to complicated for him to work. He does like the little magnets which I would find strewn all over the house. Had to put them away so that he'll have them when he is old enough to work the toy as intended. This toy should be sold for an older age if it is to be used alone."
3,It's cute,"It's much cooler looking in the preview, not as heavy or good quality for $26. It's a plastic blue print surrounding a metal weight inside. It would be nice if it was a solid piece of plastic or even glass for that kind of price."
5,buffy the vampire slayer,"I think that buffy is now one of the best series in the world. She's strong,funny, pretty. She has what we want to have in our live. She makes us dream. Thank you Buffy"
4,IT WAS GREAT!!!!,I THOUGHT THE TWO SHOWS WERE VERY GOOD. THEY COULD OF DONE MORE ABOUT THE TALENT SHOW IN THE PUPPET MASTER.
4,It's Kind of a Flimsy Star for a Funny Story,"I enjoy the fact that this movie portrays mental illness as not necessarily ""crazy"" but something anyone can catch. I just wish Gilchrist wasn't so awkward. He certainly plays the part of a 16 year old boy well. Maybe some years from now we'll see him man up in a really male oriented role. With his body, he certainly has the potential to be a future Marvel super hero."
4,surprising,"There are plenty of stories about troubled teens, this is one of the better ones. I thought the performances quite good, I particularly liked the female lead. There are some nice surprises. And the overall message, choose life, hit home for me."
3,BORING!!,"I purchased this movie because the reviews looked good. As I was watching this movie with my older children, I kept waiting for something exciting to happen. The movie does have a good lesson about life but it dragged on for me. My kids, however, felt it was a good movie. Maybe they can relate more to the pressures of growing up."
3,Ehh....,"Story line was okay, but kinda petered out towards the end. Not really a messge to it all. Just a story that went nowhere really."
2,A waste of the 5 billion hrs it took for this movie to end,"This movie was pointless, and I really don't remember laughing at any of it. My friend and I had heard that it was funny, so we decided to watch it, it was such a waste of time, and I would not recommend that anyone waste their time watching it."
1,It's Kind of a Funny Story,It's Kind of a Funny Story isn't funny even accidentally!The previews shown in the theater were the only funny parts and then when you see it in the context of the movie it just isn't funny! The story never really connects all the characters in a meanful way.
2,I DON'T AGREE,"I bought both your book as well as Mental Models AS PER YOUR RECOMMENDATION AND REGRETTED THAT MORE.Yours is information vaguely spread along 560 pages and Indi's book is totally abstract, which I am still trying to understand. I would have appreciated if you could have cut all the fluff in 60 pages instead.GOD KNOWS how do you guys get all the five stars FROM"
4,Fun for about 15 minutes.,"Very neat toy, although I think I liked it more than my 8 year old. My first one didn't come with directions, so we were a little confused on what buttons did what. The company sent us some directions after I called and it made it much easier. My favorite part was the lights in the ""horn"" that change colors. My daughter was only intrested in it for about 15 minutes though."
1,My 6 year old hates this,"I bought this for my 6 year old daughter, and when she heard it burp and fart she couldn't belive it. She said she wants to take it back because it's so grose."
5,One of Shute's best,"This is definitely one of Shute's best novels, His accurate portrayal of post war Britain to his vision of the British Commonwealth was excellent. He made the the characters and the country of Austrialia come alive and like most of his books I had a hard time putting it down. In The Wet was the the first Shute book I read and it is still one of my favourites."
5,Masterpiece,"If this is not one of the great all time recordings of Mozart Piano Sonatas, I do not know what is! Bravo, Mr. Barenboim, Bravo and Bravo and Bravo.Yes, sometimes the music seems almost to race, but the overall performance is heavenly, a formidable light touch!I have never heard anything so compelling. The birds sing in my garden when I play it with the window open. I am sure it is played as Mozart intended.8 CDs in this box, in modest cardboard envelopes, what treasure they contain! At less than fifty dollars, this is a great bargain."
5,Just the right number of notes...,"I love classical music. I've learned to listen without being hyper-critical; just lsitening with my heart. Barenboim is a gifted muscian, and this performance is yet another example of Daniel's control of the keyboard. Endless hours of great musical listening."
5,The Bach of R&B - King is in the House,"If you like any song from R Kelly, you'll love this album. I am hard pressed to find someone that doesn't like R Kelly. He is the modern Bach or Chopain of R&B. There are probably 10 songs out of 19 on this album that you could listen to three times back to back and still want more. It is that good. The other 9 are excellent as well, though 3-4 are definitely catered towards slower music for women. If you play this for your woman she will definitely love you more. ""Strip for You"" and ""One Me"" are sure panty droppers if you want to set the mood. R Kelly is a music/love machine. I have been spoiled listening to R Kelly so much that other R&B artists just don't do it for me anymore. There is only one artist I could listen to everyday, and that's R Kelly. R Kelly is timeless, and TP-2 is about as R Kelly as R Kelly can get. One thing is for sure. There is only one R Kelly. His talent makes all these other wanna be artists pale in comparison."
2,OK...who brought the CHEESE to the Party....?,"...I liked ""12 Play"", but since then Kelly's gone down hill, his sound is radio saturated, he needs have a different sound or something else...maybe a different producer, some other songwriters or sompin'--I ain't kidding either. Maybe a trip to Kathmandu or Tibet will help. I thought that the single was alright, but this leaves a lot to be desired especially that Cheesy ""Strip for You"". Pul-leeze. Just buy a replacement ""12-Play"" CD..."
1,Once again R kelly has done it.......but did we want him to.,"R kelly's carrer is full of contradictions. On one song he's singing about how good GOD is, then the next song he's Feeling on ya Boody. R kelly has so much potential to be a respectful artist. But if he continues on the corse he is now, the qualtiy of his character will continue to be decline along with his music."
1,Great R&B????????????????????,"There is a lyric in one of R.Kelly's songs that goes ""What does it profit a man to gain the world and lose his soul"" (How ironic) There is no doubt that this cd will go platinum. It contains all the cliche's, all the typical sex, money, and stereotypical lyrics that too many young gifted artist give in to. My question is where is the substance? How many times do we have to hear how many different ways there are to have sex. I think R.Kelly is extremely talented but he is selling himself short with this garbage. How I long for the days when R&b artist put out material that was thought provoking and original."
5,This cd has everything you would want,"First of all I love this cd it has everything from tight beats to romantic songs. R. Kelly can do it all. With his hit single I Wish poppin off the charts r. kelly added more flava to this cd with great tracks like the greatest sex, and I wish. He has proven that he still has flava and I can't wait until he comes out with a new cd."
5,"Easy to read, easy to do","I'm working though Psychic Pathway with a group of like-minded friends, and we all agree that Sonia's book is an easy read, compared to a lot of spirituality books out there. Recommended."
4,Good Resource,I think this book is great because it lays before you a visual of how all the orders work. It also gives a brief explanation of each motion. Perfect for a chairman to make a desicion in the midst of a big meeting.
2,DVD is a Disgrace to the Original Film,"WARNING: This DVD is in 1.33 aspect ration, so you won't see the same film as the one in the theater.If you have a widescreen tv or 16:9 projection screen you'll have black bars on the left & right sides of your screen that will make this DVD look like a ""TV Movie"".Visually this was a stunning film, shot by one of the greatest cinematographers - Jordan Cronenwenth who also filmed BLADERUNNER, STOP MAKING SENSE, etc. It is such a disservice to him and the film to NOT release this as an anamorphic widescreen DVD so the homeviewer can enjoy the great visuals.WARNER Bros., we'll rather pay a little more, and get quality!4 stars for the film, 1 star for the DVD."
2,Final Analysis-zero stars. Uma Thurman-infinite stars,"Bad movie. Lame, over-the-top, cliched, dull, one-dimensional characters, formulatic Hollywood ending. I have nothing against Richard Gere nor Kim Basinger. The acting is fine. What makes this movie so bad is the script, direction and story. And oh yeah, the DVD stinks too; horrid transfer, bare-bones with zero bonus material. A bootlegged video would offer better picture and sound quality than this.But as much as I've bashed this movie, I recommend getting it, for the sole reason of a very young (and oh my lawd, ever so sexy and gorgeous) Uma Thurman. She will make your saliva glands work a double shift. Uma is THE reason for owning this movie. Fast-forward to every scene with her and you're all set. Forget the rest.My final analysis of Final Analysis: no stars for actual movie, 2 stars for Uma Thurman (one star for Uma and another star for Thurman). Enough said."
2,Basically Boring.,"While the information in this book might be a good starting point for someone totally new to thyroid disorders, I found it too basic, and too entrenched in mainstream theory and treatments to be helpful. Too much repeating of information easily found on just about any thyroid drug manufacturer's website, or just from surfing around the web. It is not a book I kept for my personal library --which for me (books are life!) is unusual."
4,Your guide to the basics....,"The Thyroid Sourcebook answered many of the questions I had when I was first told that I have an underactive thyroid; it was very helpful in guiding me towards a better understanding of what was happening with my body. With the information presented in the book I was better able to ask the right questions of my doctors, who in turn gave me more informed answers. I had a better idea of what to expect as I followed the various treatments I was subjected to when it was later determined that I had thyroid cancer. I only wish that the author covered thyroid cancer a bit more, since it's kind of light on that. However, this book is not the definitive source on thyroid disorders, and I don't think it was meant to be, rather it is a good guide for the patient and the patient's family. If you want something that is more definitive, then perhaps a textbook on endocrinology is what you need."
4,Great Sound,"This CD has an awesome sound. The best songs are, ""Dance"", ""Did I Hurt You?"", and ""Rico"". If you liked this one, you will love their self-titled new CD. Great bunch of guys with a great message through their songs. You guys rock!"
5,The Concept is Great But...,The whole concept of this game is great but I would think it would be better if you had more options to choose from pets wise. I mean I love the Kougra and all but I have other pets that are more prioratized than the Kougra. For instance Ixi's are the greatest and that would be one that I would be really anxious to buy. Maybe if they edited the game so that you could choose your pet in the game that would be better. Any how I still bought this game and I love it. I still cant put it down. If you love neopets then this is the one game that is a must have.
2,Underwhelmed,"Well, I thought this toy was a cool concept so I bought 3 to give as Christmas gifts this year (for a 7 year old, 10 year old and 13 year old). I played with it to make sure it was living up to the reviews and I'm going to return them all. It's cute but I just don't think it's worth the money. You can make it play funky sounds but I can't see it holding a kids attention for that long. I plugged it into my ipod and was expecting that to be the greatest part (I thought it was going to dance) but it basically functioned as speakers and it's eyes bobbed up and down. Funny for a minute."
1,RUDE!,I am the mom of a 4 and 7 year old and I wish I had played with this before christmas morning. All the the talk in my house about manors has gone out the window when all this toy does is fart and burp. My kids think it is histerical - I think I will find a way to exchange it for something else.
2,I hate giving a two star.......,"rating to any MacDonald book but this one is deserves it. In my opinion it's the weakest of the McGee series. I wouldn't avoid it if I were going through the series but don't look for the usual MacDonald here. It's fairly strong on character as MacDonald always is but a very weak, convoluted plot takes away from any strength of character the writer exhibits. It's like MacDonald got caught up in it and didn't know how to extricate himself! Not a particularly good read."
5,Great might-have-been,"I just finished Resurrection Day, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Anyone who is a history buff will; being a teacher, the part about the NYC ophans and how their teachers spent the hours of a nuclear attack really got to me. Some of the other reviews here ranted about the military caricatures, but if you really know your history, the hawks were really there. It seems improbable now, but times were different then. Don't listen to all the critics, get and read this book. it's excellent!"
5,Great shoes!,"These were my first converse, and I was a bit hesitant to buy a pair online, so I went to Khols and tried on a pair there to find the correct size. I bought the Black Monochrome, and they are stylish and comfortable. And look great! I have had several compliments on them in the first week or so. A great buy!"
5,Excelente Producto,"100 por ciento complacido con la compra, llegaron en buenas condiciones y son de muy buena calidad. Altamente recomendados y a muy buen precio. Gracias."
5,Chuck's,Outstanding shoes! Just like I remembered from high school years ago. I was glad to see them make a comeback and the price is great too.
5,gift for mom,"now that she is a bit older, i would have preferred she look at shoes with a little more support and cushioning especially around the ankle areabut nooooooo, she insisted on Chucks again after not wearing them for 15 yearsaaaand, she loves them :)"
3,red converse,"kinda nice, but common coloured. Did,nt have the colour that I wanted in my size. Chocolate, sorta rare in this city. Many folks r with classic red that,s cool, though I like the chocolate chuck taylors best. Maybe i'll add another sumthin, shoe strings with prints........."
3,I bought it for a friend,"As i say i bought it for a friend and he says that is great. He wasn't wait too long for it (thanks!). He got a RDV with girl, he planned to wear it at the rendez-vous. He was worry thinking will he get it at time."
2,Hurt My Feet,"These shoes look great. They are very trendy and a lot of people are wearing them nowadays. The biggest problem I have with these shoes is that they hurt my feet. The soles are too flat. When I tried running in them, my heels began to hurt. Walking wise, they aren't the most comfortable to say the least. They are also heavy for what they are. Too expensive for what they are. These shoes are probably bad for your back because they don't absorb any impact. Personally, I don't recommend them for anyone."
5,love my converse chucks!!,"I love my Converse Chucks! glad a picked grey, goes with alot of stuff. I usually wear a 9 or 8& half n my chucks fit fine :) happy with my purchase!"
2,READ CAREFULLY!!!!,"They picture high tops and only write in the title that it is a converse and whatever color. Only after you order and then see the shoes listed under open purchases does it finally tell you that the item you just bought is low top. I was so upset. Deceiving and conniving company. Then you have to pay for the postage to send it back. I read an earlier review from someone who had the same problem but I thought ""hey, it only happened to one person"" Well, it happened to me too. Just be super careful and read everything.I have only just opened the box, so I don't know how good/bad the quality is yet. The sizing is right, I am a woman's 8, to that is a men's 6.It did arrive on time and the correct color and size i selected, but I REALLY REALLY wanted the high tops. The picture was of high top shoes."
3,Sizing information wasn't accurate enough,"Original quality product received, however I followed the advice and bought a US size 11 which is normally a euro size 10.5 (as I take a 10-10.5, this was the size I needed). Converse say to buy a half size smaller than you need, but it would be too risky to do that and have too tight a shoe, so I bought the size I needed. 10.5 wasn't a listed size option anyhow.The label in the shoe says they are US 11 and UK 11. Go figure - doesn't make sense. So they are a half size too big. If only they told you that information somewhere up front."
5,opinion de compra,estoy feliz con la compra pues no conseguia numero grande en chile para mi esposo. ademas la entrega fue rapida
5,Most comfortable shooes,"I love converse, they are the most comfortable shoes.Its been one year I am using them( very rough) still goinggood just started looking bit worn out but that gives it more awesome look"
1,Poor description,"Though I am very familiar with Chuck Taylor's and their sizing, this site confused me. I ended up ordering the incorrect size and had to send them back to the company. Though the company did end up crediting my account back."
3,Converse all-stars,The shoes were not the size that I thought I was ordering. I wanted a women's size. These will be sent back.
5,Excellent Product,"I ordered these shoes for my boyfriend and he absolutely loves them. They look great and are true to size. He said he wishes these shoes had more arch support because he has to wear insoles, but that is typical of this particular shoe."
5,Stunning,"These projects are all absolutely fantastic. The charts are easy to read and understand, and there are several pages of descriptions of various stitches used for the projects. Highly recommended!"
3,Disappointed!,It's too thin.and it's so vacant.It's not good printed state. so It's not easy to read.I want good typo.
4,Want Politically Correct? Read an encyclopedia....,"The first five or six books in the series are serious reads. I find that if you focus on Norman's obvious fascination with bondage, the series lose some of their flavor. This is why some of the later books aren't as well liked. (He REALLY got into the bondage details, for chapters it seemed!) If you're uptight in the least, these books aren't for you, but if you can accept them for what they are, extremely detailed views into a totally alien world with strange cultures, you'll love them as I do. Add to this, a hero such as Tarl Cabot and BAM!"
5,Quality Soccer Drills That Help Players Improve & Have Fun!,"The soccer drills in this great DVD setcome at you like a Beckham corner kick.There is no useless talking. Just useful drills.Each soccer DVD lives on it's own merits.If your soccer league has a little money, it would bea shame not to invest in these.The return on investment will be great!HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"
4,This thing is great!!,"I think this thing is great! I got one 12 hours ago and it is so fun. The games are simple, the layout is great, and the lighting is good. One complaint... The games only give you Neopoints the first three times you play it a day, unless you want to play the slots game. Overall, this product is one of the best toys I've played with. I highly recommend it to all the Neopets fans around. Plus you can take this thing everywhere!"
5,great,it was fun educational in side is a whole new world where you learn to spend save and shop and I gave it to my sister and she loved it you can also go online at neopets.com and if you have a neopet accont you get a rare virtule item.
5,Sharp and heartbreaking....,"....but ultimately not so sad or depressing that you want to put it down. Your heart breaks for Hattie, but in the end she learns that she can rely on herself, even when her own mother lets her down. If you liked this, I'd also recommend Liar's Club, She's Come Undone, An Egg on Three Sticks, and anything by Ellen Gilchrist."
2,Under developed characters,"The character development was poor and insufficient, almost like the author tried to disguise the identity of them. As far as what was there, it was accurate, from my experience with people suffering from a bi-polar disorder but I wouldn't look here for any great insights. Worth a read if you don't have anything else handy because it is a fast read, but I've read short stories that were better thought out."
5,Great original looking product,Fit my 96 ford ranger perfect. Looks just like the originalone that was on it. Great product overall and good packaging
2,You can do better,"I ordered this sight unseen, and unfortunately cannot recommend other similar dictionaries. However, I found that this dictionary had significant gaps in the vocabulary covered. The cover boasted of coverage of insurance terms, but failed to include fairly basic insurance terms such as Hoechentschaedigungsgrenze (indemnification limit). Further, what listings the book does contain can best be described as bare bones. The entries indicate the gender of nouns, but do not include phoenetic pronounciations or suffixes for plural forms. I found the book to be of little assistance in my work. When I return to the market for such a dictionary, I will search for better option."
4,Good value!,"Ordered this kit on 3/11/2010 from Amazon with free shipping and received it the next day--couldn't ask for better service. Plus, Dynomax has a mail-in rebate on this unit that knocks $75 off the price.To give you an idea of the quality of these components, I installed this exact muffler and tailpipe on my Jeep Cherokee approximately 5 years/25k miles ago. About 6 months ago I started to hear the telltale sounds of a worn out muffler, plus the stainless tip on the tailpipe fell off as I was driving down the road. Eventually the connection between the tailpipe and muffler was completely rusted out and I had to replace it. I chose the Dymomax 17340 again due to its low cost, and it only took me a few hours to install. In the unlikely event that I still own this vehicle 5 years from now, I'll do it again!"
4,Great system for the price...,"Nice exhaust System especially for the price, but my stupid son decided he didn't like it after about a year and ripped it out and put up a cherry bomb held up by a coat hanger. He said it was rattling on the rear, but his jeep has a tank skid guard that affects the fit. He also said that one of the mounts rusted off, but he has taken his Cherokee four wheeling a lot and I think the hard bouncing and bumps may affect the durability on the tailpipe."
5,Easy Install and Great Fit,Was looking for an exhaust system that wouldn't shrink my wallet and also give me a performance level to match my Cherokee. The Dynomax Exhaust System did just that. Great Price point and easy to install made it a super value with a plus of performance. The only thing i would recommend to the manufacture of the pipe is to take the sharp edge off the chrome pipe tip so the end user won't get cut. Other than that its a super deal !!!!
5,Great fit along with an easy install!,"Removed old system and got this one installed in about 2 hours total. Fit's like the original. Did not come w/ the 2 nuts to bolt to catalytic,(Metric), but other than that great system for price. The stainless exhaust tip looks good, the 'throaty' exhaust tone sounds way cooler than factory! Seems to have better throttle-response, but might be my imagination. The design and construction are great. I highly recommend this system."
4,gigantic tome of non erotic frontal nude men.,whispy and poetic and just as the title says Sombra--shadows. for the collector of this artists work it is a must have.
1,Joseph D. Douglass is out of touch with reality,"This whole book is ridiculous. Instead of wasting tons of space and loads of my time, I'll wrap it up quickly: What Douglass purports to be true in his book, i.e., the transfer of US POWs to the Soviet Union via Czechoslovakia could not have happened. Look at the timeline. Douglass would have rational people believe that the Soviets would use the Czechs to transfer US POWs at the same time the Soviets INVADED Czechoslovakia. So, let's see - the evil KGB would enlist the help of the same people they were CRUSHING? Come on. This is ridiculous and shows that anyone can get a book published."
4,"Charming book, good read","This is a delightful story. The dialogue is witty, and Maddie is a fully drawn character, as is the stuffy marquess. Enoch is one of my go-to authors, and this story validates my conviction."
1,Too much talk and no bark . . .,I was very disappointed with this book. I found the heroine to be too childish and tedious; she fought over everything and after a while it became annoying. His brother Rafael should have been the hero - he had more guts!
3,historical ballet document,"The picture of Maya Plisetskaya is deceving, if one only buy the video because of her.This is a more interessting video if one want to witness Galina Ulanova in all her glory. The first ballet ''collage'' is an rare film studio version of Swan lake, With a lot of special effects. Specially the tranformation swan/human is worth mentioning + animated parts. It also includes a mashinegun speeded Natalia Dudinskaya as the Black swan. The fountains of Bakhhisarai is the only ballet one can see Ulanova/Plisetskaya , dancing together. The the flames of Paris is only of'' historical document'' interest. Charlie Chaplin would have done it better!"
1,Author's God is still too small.,"This book was somewhat of a disappointment. The author started out well by describing a number of God types that are accepted by many, but don't really exist.Unfortunately, when it came to explaining the God that he thought did exist, he went straight to the ""New Testament"" of the Bible, and limited his views to a rather fundamental Christian concept. He ignored the other valid religious ideas and stuck to the ""guilty until proven innocent"" point of view of most of the Christian world. An infinite Creator/Creation cannot be understood by any limited idea, especially one that insists on taking scriptural writing literally."
4,"a good, readable presentation","J. B. Phillips has written a book that the average lay person can read and understand and react very positively to. This book quotes a lot from his translation of the Bible and that certainly enhances the book. A good read on Christianity for all Christians.J. Robert Ewbank author ""John Wesley, Natural Man, and the 'Isms'"""
3,This isn't the new Prodigy....,"This is a good song, that should have been included on the last album. The Prodigy, Liam to be specific, has said this is not going to be on the new album and have admitted that this is more like their older work. Looking for the older Prodigy, you'll find it here, don't expect the new sound till early next year."
3,hmmmm.....,"well, i didn't know what to expect. i liked the single and was interested enough to check it out. their first album is great. this one slips a little. it's still a good album but at times the songwriting seems forced in way. a couple of songs sound like filler. and his lyrics are not as thought out. ""prison song"" is a little too blantantly political to be enjoyed as a good song. it can repititious at times (loud/screaming-soft/singing-loud-soft again-screaming again, ect.) overall one of the better albums to come out this year. i also recommend slipknot's iowa."
2,Terrible,"This is just terrible...I bought the CD after hearing ""Chop Suey"" and ""Aerials"" over and over and over again on the radio and thinking that maybe this band had grown up a little bit. But no, it's still mostly pointless thrash to even more pointless lyrics. A few bright spots shine through - ""Atwa"" and ""Toxicity"" actually have melodies, which is a welcome departure from the noise that permeates the rest of the album.I guess it's rough being a heavy metal kid these days. I mean, Tool is practically the only decent band out there, and they don't exactly put out zillions of albums. But there's gotta be something better than Korn and System of a Down, yeesh."
3,okay,"Now this band got mainstream because of this album. However, if you are the type of person that is still thinking about buying this album because you heard Chop Suey & Toxicity and think that this album has more songs like that, then i suggest you dont buy it. Chop Suey & Toxicity are the gems of this album, but from my point of view those are the only two that are worth listening to"
5,one of the best metal bands ever,"I have had the first soad album sense it came out and i got this the day it came out. toxicity is defently different from the self title album it faster more hard core and less of darons awsome solos, and the chop suey song is the only song like that pretty much (which is a good thing cuase that is way to acoustic for soad0 the rest of the stuff is pretty good. system of a down is the future of music."
5,As much to be expected from SoaD,"If their first album wasn't good enough for you... which I don't see how it couldn't be... You should look into getting this album, with the poetic writings of Serj Tankian, and with the melodic Bass and Lead Guitars, mixed with the rythmic drums, this isn't an album to miss!"
4,Not thier best,This cd was not thier best but it did have some hard hitting lyrics. If I was you I would still buy it.
5,powerful,"Not only did the entire cd captivate me, but the intro contained the initial attraction. I actually dig the lyrics more than the music"
4,Awesome Christmas gift,This was a Christmas gift for my nephew who loves SOAS. I have had this for several years and listen to it constantly. It's still one of my favorites.
5,A Great CD,This is such a great CD. More melodic tunes than their last album..but heavy at the same time. My favorite song has to be Chop Suey! followed by Deer Dance and Jet Pilot. Serj has a one of a kind voice. I haven't checked out the Cd-rom yet..but I bet it's great. This is a must-have CD.
5,System Of A Down rulz! That's right!,"Through it memorably debuted at No. 1 on September 11, 2001, System Of A Down's second album is a snapshot of American in the wake of 9/11 - angry, manic, paranoid, and confused, yet, still searching for flashes of magic in daily existence."
5,Sweet disc with an equally sweet DVD,"I love this friggin CD. It has to be one of the best follow-ups I've heard for a while, right along the lines of Slipknot: Iowa and Disturbed: Believe (in case you're wondering, I just bought this the other day). Buy this one!..."
5,"They're trying to build a prison, for you and me to live in!","This is my favorite CD of all time probably. The songs have so much political and social meaning to me. System of a Down probably has just a hint of an intended meaning in their songs, but they don't care how you take their lyrics. That's the whole point. Their songs only mean what they mean to you. So much people say they're a religeous band and a political band, it's not true. They sing and dance about what they see around them in this world. This CD is so great though. Shimmy is probably my favorite song now. I think it's about the insane subjugating school system. Some awsome tunes and lyrics here."
2,horrible cd,i was wanting to buy this cd but im glad i diddnt i burned it from my cousins. After hearing toxicity and chop suey the rest of the songs are horrible. i think that all the procides for this cd is going to terrorsim. WARNING: DONT BUY THIS CD
5,Truly madly deeply insane,This album is so full of time changes i didnt know what way my head was going to roll to ..a brillant awesome modern rock album that makes you never wanna stop listening to metal me im in my 18 year started im my nappy and enough of that filth.. i hope there next album is better than that mixed bag of rubbish steal this album a total cash in with 3 good songs sorry not good enough when u go from this sort of album the next is always going to be a disappointment so i dare system to better this album if they do i will give them a written apology but i doubt it thank you for caring to read this Respect
5,...,"Talk about non stop energy. System Of A Down's sophmore release, ""Toxicity"" has people talking, and talking loud. Hailed as ""one of the best albums, EVER"" by many critics, SOAD shuts down the skeptics and the critics who thought they could not top their debut album.Not only does it top the album, it blows it out of the water. Serj and he boys have really done their job here, and offer a unique brand of metal that stands out from most of the nu-metal/rapcore sludge out there.A must-have for all rock fans, ""Toxicity"" will have you pumped up for a long time."
5,Dear God,Dear God this has to be the greatest album of the year. No other band sounds anything like System of a Down. System has a unique sound and style all their own and this is ever more aparent in Toxicity. They match incredible lyrics with amazing instrumentals and vocals puting their original album to shame.
5,THIS ALBUM KICK'S MAJOR ASS!!!!!!!!!!!,"this album kick's major ass so this is how i rate it1. Prision Song: 8/10sounds like a hard song to sing, great opener2. Needles: 7/10pretty good song funny lyrics3. Deer Dance: 6/10Nice hard song just a reg SOAD song4. Jet Pilot: 8/10Very Hard song fast pace the only problem is it's over before you know it.5.

3,Ditch the thrash,"This band would be so much better if they would give up the sudden loud outbursts. These are good in some contexts, but the subtler parts on this cd are often laughably juxtaposed against a sudden screaming chorus. See the song ""Atwa"""
5,Awesome album,"System of a down is one of my all time favoritenew metal bands of this decade.I think this is thelandmark album for system,they really made it bigwith this one.Everysong on here is awesome.Somefans have different opinions on which one they likebetter Toxity or the first album,self titled.I loveboth of these albums and the new one Steal this album.However musically I think all their albums areamazing.Some fans think that the first one is heavieror toxity is heavier than the first one.PersonallySystem of a down is always heavy and hopefully theywill never sell out.My favorite songs on Toxity areArials,Toxity,Bounce,Prison song,Science,Psycho and wellbasically I love them all.I think Toxity is their bestalbum,even though I love the first one alot.The steal thisalbum is just as awesome as the other 2.I can't wait fortheir next full length studio album."
5,AMAZING,Dont listen to any of the idiots above me.this album is my favourite in the world.Buy it. it is worth ten times wht they charge..
1,Complete Liberal Garbage!!,"This music is sooo old and tired. These punks are your typical angry Californians...you know the ones...""Lets all Riot, and then cry discrimination when the Police arrest us for commiting crimes, lets overthrow the corupt government, the government puts too many people in jail"" etc, etc. Blah Blah. (...) Anyway, musically the CD is average, and lirically the CD is terrible. Only a cute video and MTV's air play (...) have brought commercial success to these sad sacks. (...)"
1,crap of the millenium,"thank god this ridicolous genre of ""rock"" (!) is dying because never in history music has been so poor.but the most otrageus thing is that this bunch of wannabe ""musicians"" have said that the immortal and great led zeppelin was a source of inspiration for them...hahahahahled zeppelin wrote masterpieces and they were all real musicians and robert plant a marvelous real singer.the only band with a zeppelin sound today are the darkness.I really hope that america will redescover real rock music,and a good way to do is listen to soul sirkus a wonderful real rock band with the grea neal schon and jeff scott soto into it."
5,BEST S.O.A.D. CD YET!!!,"I know this cd is pretty old now, but I still crank this cd up. Every single cd is the best!!!! How do they do it? If you do not have this cd, BUY IT!!"
1,I did not like it,I used this for an introductory EM course. Not even remotely helpful. There are not any equations. No examples. The only good pat is that the problems have odd solutions in the back.
1,NOT a 'breed specific' book on Chesapeakes,"I purchased this book thinking it was going to be a book specifically talking about Chesapeake Bay Retrievers, it wasn't.I would venture to guess that if you took the few pages about Chesapeakes OUT of the book, ALL of the books written by this author geared toward a specific breed would all read the same!Not a book to buy if you are looking for information on Chessies."
1,This book Blew the bag Ha Ha By Steve Austin,Who ever wants a piece of me will have to tell me so on this web page and thats the bottom line cause Stone Cold said so
4,Medical Info combined with Emotional Info,"I bought this book after 2 years + of infertility, and still learned information from Dr. Marrs. The tone of his book is not condescending, but helpful to the reader, and the patient experiences he puts in the book to discuss the emotional aspects of the disease cover all areas that couples go through. An wonderful resource!"
5,Great guide for anyone undergoing infertility treatments,Dr. Marrs' Fertility Book is a handy reference for couples who may be experiencing infertility. Dr. Marrs clearly explains the various procedures used to determain the cause(s) of infertility. He also provides detailed explainations on the various treatments used to try and acheive pregnancy. Dr. Marr's book has answered many of my questions as I work through my own infertility issues. I highly recommend this book as a handy reference for anyone who is being treated for infertility.
3,Parent Soccer Coach - quite useful,"For a parent soccer coach who's new to the job, I found this DVD quite useful in teaching some basics. However it could have used a bit more practical info, such as tips on keeping kids' attention (this is my biggest problem) - how to impose some discipline whilst still keeping it ""fun"" - tips on getting kids to talk and work as a team. these seem like important basics that were left out. Another thing that seems amazingly absent on teaching kids to tackle or take away the ball from an opponent. That would have been much more useful than the time spent teaching ""heading"". still I learned some stuff and the instructor is quite good and methodical."
4,"Cool puzzle, not highest quality pieces","We are really enjoying this puzzle, and learning a lot. The information written on the oceans makes the puzzle more interesting and manageable.The pieces are necessarily very small to match the size of the countries. The bigger problem is that they curl up just a bit, so the pieces don't lie flat as you make the puzzle. This is frustrating, and you don't get that satisfying feeling as you put a piece in, as you have to press it down a few times and it still doesn't quite flatten down. I'm trying covering the finished puzzle with heavy books, but I suspect it's just a problem of cheap glue.Still, I give it four stars since a good world puzzle is very hard to find, and the content is good."
4,fun and educational,"We put this together as a family and it was fun and educational too. I was happy see my family learning and spending time together. The puzzle was tricky but, fun.We will do this puzzle many more times as the kids grow up I am sure. I recommend it!"
4,great toy,"We bought this puzzle for our 10 year old daughter. 600 pieces seems to be the magic number. She gets frustrated with 1,000 piece puzzles, but anything under 500 is boring because she can finish it in 10 minutes. This is a great educational toy and you can't beat the price."
1,I'll Pass on this next time.,Bought 2 of these with the idea of keeping one and giving the other to my mother. Neither worked well and failed soon after using. The seller was magnificent and refunded our money.
4,Strong writer shows chops,"David Weber has become one of the premier writers in SF and fantasy. Here he demonstrates why. Good character development, strong story line, and a clear sense of humor run throughout the story."
3,What a disappointment!,"I greatly enjoyed the first two books of the series, but this one is a joke.1. Everybody gets more and better powers. And even more and better powers. No, really. What a cheap trick.2. Leena irritated me. The war maids irritated me even more.3. There are at least two plot points that received absolutely no resolution.Mind you, Bahzell's relationship with his God is always fun to see, and some of the nonmagical battles were nice. But this was as tremendous waste of time on my part."
1,Worse ever video,I ordered this DVD since I loved the Trinity movies. The picture was horrible. It was as if Fellini was on acid. The dubbing was terrible and the story was uniteresting. I would not recommend this movie to anyone.
4,Arrived super fast & in exellent condition,"Arrived super fast & in exellent condition, but i expected to have subtitles in Spanish."
3,Pretty good,"Recieved quickly. Seeds in good condition yet had no luck in sprouting st. Johns wart at any temperature. About a quarter of each packet are duds but they give you a nice amount of seeds. Good for the outdoor gardener. They also do not include any information on the origins of the seeds, or harvesting conditions. Slightly suspect. All around pretty good for the price though."
4,Actors needed deportment lessons,"I watch historical TV series primarily for the sumptuous sets and costumes (this is not the place to seriously study history). ""Victorian & Albert"" has gorgeous sets and costumes, but I really wish they'd given the actors some lessons in period movement. In particular the one who played Queen Victoria. The real queen never had a tiny waist, hollow cheekbones, and prominent shoulder blades--even at 18. But at least it's understandable that the producers wanted her to conform to a modern ideal of beauty. The actress's movements, however, are atrocious-and she's never still. She has a heavy (audible!) tramping walk, she wriggles her arms, she hunches and shrugs her shoulders, she has a million little pouts and grimaces. And on top of it all there's her prolonged, husky giggle. Put her back in ""Sex & the City,"" or wherever she came from, and back in a bathing suit, or whatever she's used to wearing."
4,Victoria and Albert DVD Review,This mini-series was very good. The period costumes were excellent and the acting was good as well. It gives a fairly accurate representation of Queen Victoria's younger days when meeting Prince Albert.
3,A bit weak,"This did not quite hit the mark for me. There were times when the acting was outstanding, such as when the old boy's club thought they would manipulate young Queen Victoria, and she would have none of it, but overall something was lacking. For one thing, Prince Albert was too much like Ringo Starr, and not at all what he would have been in reality. He was, in fact, Saxony German, after all. Victoria's loyalty to him, even after death, knew no bounds, but that does not, in and of itself, make a good video production. Thus the 3 stars: average."
5,"Illuminates the ""Fog of War""","As someone who has never served in the armed services, this well-researched biography of Colt Terry, a person I had never heard of before, certainly paints a vivid picture of the chaos that accompanies war. The Special Forces, have gotten much greater attention in modern times in Afganistan and Iraq, yet this book doesn't concentrate on the formation of the Green Berets, rather its focus is on a single individual and his life as it relates to the institution. Unusual in the sense that it is easy-to-read, as much as the subject matter is heavy and sometimes disturbing. Well worth it for the lay reader as well as the military historian."
4,Pretty Good Start,"Ive been a Depeche Mode fan for a while now, and I just listened to thier first album ""Speak and Spell"" and I must say, its pretty good.With the exception of ""Whats Your Name?"", all of the songs are pretty good. Vince was a OK writer, but he wasnt the best. Martin's songs were good. I liked ""Tora! Tora! Tora!"" and the instrumental ""Big Muff"" is pretty good. The Voices version of ""Any Second Now"" and the Schizo mix of ""Just Cant Get Enough"" are good, but I like the original versions of the songs better."
3,Mind Numbing,"It's hard to rate this with stars, so I just gave it three. I just wanna quote a close friend here: This album is so bad that it bypassed bad, went to good, then went full circle back to bad again.I think it's bad in one of those hilarious good ways. Just hearing the lyrics of Photographic makes me laugh harder than when I watch President Bush speak.. and that's alot of laughing. So I think that if you have a sick and twisted sense of humor, and for instance enjoy the failure of a prominent rock band, you should own this. But don't buy it! steal it, burn it, whatever.. it is just not worth twenty dollars, or even ten dollars. I'm probably gonna get it from a dm fan who doesn't want the album to shame her collection.I don't know why I like this album.. it's a sick fasination.. like a freak show. It's so bad, it blows your mind! I didn't know such awful things could be released. Such a mistake for a first album!"
5,Pick it up!,"This was depeche mode's first release and sounds quite different from their later recordings of course. This is a great start for anyone new to DM , This also comes with some intresting facts about DM's upbbringing. BUY IT"
4,I wish people would watch it for what it is...,"Constantine is my favorite comic book movie of all time. Not only does the character display REAL FLAWS, which is refreshing, but he also has power without physically changing. In other words, he is a hero, without a flashy suit. He is cursed, and as an anti-hero that makes him earn our trust, and admiration.If you are watching this movie and are trying to figure it out from a Catholic point of view....okay, it's a movie. So stop the shenanigans, and enjoy the bug guy, the twin psychics, the voodoo priest, the ability to send anything to hell and to call upon the angels.If you are watching this movie and you have already hated Mr Reeves, please note that you are biased. He plays the character of Constantine as he was depicted in the comics well. In fact there are not too many others in Hollywood that I could imagine as irreverent and brooding as Keanu Reeves. To boot, my favorite devil portrayal makes an appearence near the end."
4,not bad keanue can almost act in this film.,Keanue Reeves the man is HOT and let's face it is not the best actor. However he was pretty good in this one. Overall not to bad for a Keanue movie.
4,Pretty darn good considering...,"Considering that Keanu Reeves is the lead, which is the only reason this got four instead of five stars. (I can't stop picturing him in Bill & Ted) I really don't know how so many people could hate this movie. Admittedly, if you're going to see a movie that's deep and entirely filled with philosophy on the nature of god, yada, yada, yada, this is probably not the movie for you. However, if you're looking for classic good versus evil, and a good time with a few humorous moments thrown in, then I would definitely recommend this. I'm not going to compare it to the comic because I've never read it, but even so I think this is a good stand alone film because it explains all you need to know, and understanding is not dependent on being familiar with the comic before you watch it."
3,Middle of the road,This movie is one of those theologian movies that are in the middle of the road. Neather bad or good. But is entertaining enough to watch more than once.
1,Cable movie of the week at best.,"Horrible Keanu Reeves movie that is with out a doubt the worse film he has ever made. Keanu was not right for the role and his performance shows that in a real and painful light. Most of the actors are just as bad a he is with only Rachel Weisz, Peter Stormare and Djimon Hounsou giving good performances with the little they had to work with and they do upstage Keanu and the horrible script but even with their great talent, they still can't save this movie from being as bad as it is.Thumbs up for the efforts made by Weisz, Stormre and Hounsou but a big thumbs down for the movie itself. Maybe the three of them could work together again in a better movie."
1,"Weisz, Stormare and Hounsou are great but the movie is not.","To make this as quick and as painless as possible, the movie was a huge letdown. Keanu Reeves look like he was just going though the motions here and delivers a rather stale performance that is the worse one in the entire film and that's a great feet considering that Shia LaBeouf, gives a painfully unfunny performance as his pet sidekick. Rachel Weisz is great but she's stuck with Keanu way too much and she would have been much lead than he was because she at least made you care about what was happening with the film while Keanu was just playing his Neo character again. Djmon Hounsou is fine but wasted in a bit part and Peter Stormare is criminally underused in a cameo.The special effects are great but there is really no story to be told and the script is pretty bad in some parts.Avoid."
1,"Weak, very weak.","Dumb Keanu Reeves horror epic that is not only the actors worse film by far but a bad film in it's own right. Keanu is just wrong for the role and the script is joke in many ways. Most of the performances are not very good. (Shia LaBeouf was horrible and made Keanu look like an Oscar winner by comparison) The only performance of merit is that of Rachel Weisz and she literally keeps you glued to your seat with her powerful and emotional performance. Unfortunately, while she gives her all, the rest of the movie is in self destruction mold all around her with bad special effects, very bad dialog and a story that makes no sense what so ever.I stand with the majority, Rachel Weisz is the only good thing about this film, so wait for Dvd to see this film and in the mean time rent Runaway Jury or the Shape of things. Two very good movies that compliment Weisz's performance unlike this one does."
1,"If this is the best they have to offer, then take it back","Bland rip off of a great comic book not only puts the worse actor imaginable for the main character but has a script that is almost a crime in itself. The dialog is so bad that it would even make deaf children cry and the special effects are not as good as one might hope. Some of the acting is great and that's a great feat in itself because of how bad the script is. Rachel Weisz, Djimon Hounsou and Peter Stormare do great work here and for that, people should be grateful for but it's still Keanu's film and he still torpedo it with a lousy performance that is in tune with the lousy script it has.If this is the best they have to offer for the fans of the comic book, then take it back."
1,Really pretty bad.,"Very bad Keanu Reeves film that could be one of the worse films ever made. Keanu sinks it up so badly that he should be thrown out of Hollywood all together and they should include the director and the screenwriters as well because the movie is as bad as Keanu's performance. Out of the entire cast only Rachel Weisz gives a real performance in this movie and she is so good in fact that she does almost redeems the entire film but not even her great talent could save it from the script, which is excruciatingly bad and the direction, which is as bad as the script and lacks focus for what its trying to accomplish. The story makes no sense and manages to go against itself in certain scenes and the climax literally destroys the narrative that the movie was trying to build up.Maybe asking for a competed director and a lead actor who can act was a tall order for the producers of this film."
3,Smoking is bad... the hell with it,"Keanu Reaveswas bas as usual, the effects and the screenplay were great, but my comment is rather unusual. I believe that this movie presents smoking as a plaque sent from hell, as it would be described in Apocalypse of John. Think of it, Reaves smokes all the time, he gets a weapn called dragon's breath, he fights with a devil of smoke that is killed by a red van (red for stop). I do not know whether it was founded by the tobacco companies or by groups against them... smoking usually might sell subconsiously just by being bad.-D"
4,Keanu at his best,This is an amazing film. The graphics on this film were exquisite. It just goes to show that Keanu Reeves can play any part. He is a exorcist that is trying to buy his way into heaven by casting demons back into the hell from which they came. There is only one outcome to this breath taking plot. Will he get in or will he get rejected? You have to see it to believe.
3,"mildly entertaining, but ultimately forgettable","I never bothered to watch this movie until the HD DVD came out and now I know why. While the movie is not terrible, there is absolutely nothing memorable about it. I just watched it last night and am having a hard time recalling the plot. Keanu Reeves plays John Constantine, a man condemned to Hell for trying to kill himself and trying to attain redemption by banishing demons back to the underworld. I like Keanu, but most of the time he reminds me of Neo, his character in the Matrix trilogy. And in the Matrix movies, he reminded me of his character Ted in Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure. The rest of the cast, including Rachel Weisz, was fine, the special effects were good, and there were even a few funny moments. I was never too bored while watching it, but in the end it left me feeling empty. The HD DVD transfer is one of the better ones, but this movie is a rental at best."
3,Confusing yet cool,"I dont want people to be Mad at me when I say this wasent a very good movie. For all you people who are obssesed with this movie and will kill anyone who gives it a bad review, I recomend that you not read the following review.Anyway Constantine is really confusing. It follows a Exorsist trying to buy back his way into heaven because he has done so much bad stuff. He meets a girl who is determined to find out why her sister has comited suicide, so she askes for Constantine's help.I am not saying this movie was horrible but it just wasent that good. I give it 3.5 stars because the special effects and action was relly cool, but the story line wasen't.Thank you for reading my review, I hope it was helpful."
4,Good Movie!,"this is a decent movie to get a good fright to lol just as good as when i saw it in theaters. i have the dvd and blu-ray now, time to ditch the dvd lol 4 Stars!"
3,"High expectations...Underwhelming, but Visually interesting and entertaining.","I had high expectations for this movie, especially afterThe Ultimate Matrix Collection (The Matrix/ The Matrix Reloaded/ The Matrix Revolutions/ The Animatrix)series, but Keanu Reeves seems to be playing the same character over and over in different films. This movie reminded me of his portrayal of previous characters, but mostly he just seemed flat.Despite the casting issues, the movie is visually appealing and the special effects are usually great. The movie, however, kinda plods along, and I get the feeling that Keanu Reeves would rather be somewhere else.One bonus for me is that The Evil One looks a heck of a lot like my ex-father in law, and that seemed appropriate...but that's just a singular, personal bonus. Seriously, this is a flawed movie, but it is worth watching. I expected more, but the visual effects and several scenes compensate the viewer for the slower scenes and general feel of the movie."
1,Very stupid,"Very stupid adaptation of the DC horror comic book not only lacks brains but also a lacks an actor who can pull off the complex role of John Constantine. Keanu Revees is gravely miscast as John Constantine, which is a shame because Reeves could have pulled off the role but with a screenplay that is so badly written, Keanu does not come out looking good at all and makes an complete fool out of himself in the process. Only Rachel Weisz and Djimon Hounsou manages to pull though this mess with their dignity intact and that's manly because they bring far too much acting talent to this badly made film. I suggest you see it for Weisz and Hounsou because they are the only good things about this bad movie."
1,and now a delux edition ...why,"What a terrible movie,Reeves is just horrible and boring in this role.Maybe a spectacle for the kids but I think this film would put most inteligent adults to sleep or just prompt them to hit the eject button.Watching this really is like a trip into hell !!"
3,"got balls, intersting interp of angels","dudes, this movie is like bladerunner meets stigmatta, or some sh**. like,, i can appreciate the steppin out on a limb reinterpreting angels, the bible, hell, and all t he rules. but, dude, when you make the archangle, like, a bisexual hoo-hoo, well, it doens't say a lot for the filmmakers sense of goodness in the world. i mean, wow, what a bleak outlook on sh**. like, time to do an intervention with that filmmaker, get him some help, dude. but it did scare me, and i though it was tight, the satan dude rocked! and the part at the end where the plot twist forced satan back down was awesome... what else... duede this review is too long... i'm out. j."
1,Rachel Weisz is fantastic but the movie itself is shallow and empty.,"Shallow and empty horror movie that manages to lower your I.Q. while you are watching it with a flat out horrible performance by Keanu Reeves, who manages to make his matrix performances look Oscar worthy by comparison. The direction by first time director Frances Lawrence lacks passion for the material and not to mention professionalism and the script is by far the most offensive thing in the entire film with a very confusing story line that does not make much sense and some pretty incredible bad dialog. My heart goes out to some of the good actors in this film, who does bring their amazing talent to this waste of celluloid especially Rachel Weisz, who manages to overcome the very bad script to give a tight and powerful performance that the movie clearly does not deserved. The one star in this review goes to her for her valiant effort to give a good performance despite the horrible script and her retarded leading man."
4,Fun time at the theater,"Keanu really does these movies so well. The opening scenes were some of the most memorable I have ever seen! The one where he was pulling the demon out of the child was hands down awesome! I wouldn't say this movie is scary, I would say it's going to be real for those of us who believe in Heaven and hell. Just kind of makes you think."
3,decent blu-ray at a good Amazon price,"not bad, with good HD audio. the picture quality is more than decent, but little of that 3D blu-ray pop throughout the disc; the opening sequence in Mexico looks great on my Panasonic 50"" 1080p via a Panasonic BD10AK, but that's as good as it will get. there's a definite upgrade over the DVD in facial detail and the like, but at almost $30, it's best to get this either used or off of Amazon at a discount.i've always been a fan of the Constantine movie, and this was several steps better than the DVD. i used the AVS blu-ray tier forum to help make my purchasing decision."
4,Constantine a Good HD DVD but not great.,"Basically all the previous 4 or 5 reviews are correct about the film. So lets talk about the picture, its in a word, great. The story is like action-Exorsist. I think most people will like it. Constantine is dark and its based off a dark comic. Its full of extras and includes an alternate ending so you will NOT feel bad about your purchase. If you are looking for something different to try on HD DVD, then pick up this and a copy of Serenity on HD DVD. This movie is a great way to round out you HD DVD collection."
4,This could have been a contender . . .,"NOTE: This review refers to the deluxe two-disc edition of the movie. For some reason, Amazon just lumps them in with the regular edition.I enjoyed this movie and I'm glad I shelled out for the deluxe edition, if only because of the Hellblazer comic that's included with the package. I was hoping the extras would add more in the way of explanations for some of what happens in the film, but they don't. This is why the entire package loses one star. Particularly aggravating is the commentary from Akiva Goldsman and the director. Goldsman's voice is like listening to nails on a chalkboard. I eventually had to turn off the commentary because I couldn't take the noise anymore. The extras on the second disc are diverting, and it's nice to learn more about the comic, but it also settles for being superficial instead of tackling some of the deeper issues that underlie this deliciously creepy story."
2,Makes Hellboy look like a masterpiece.,"Dimwitted supernatural thriller that is a major bore for the most part with a dimwitted performance by Keanu Reeves, who is miscast in the main role and a screenplay that is as stupid as it can be. A lot has been said about Rachel Weisz being the only good thing that this movie has to offer and I will agree with that assessment because she does make you care about what is going on with the movie while you are trying to figure out a way to care about the dumb story that is being told. Weisz's performance is much too rich and powerful for a movie like this and she gives you a reason to stick around while in essence there is no reason to even stay till the end. Hellboy was a masterpiece compared to this and that was marginal decent for what it was at the very best.For Weisz's rich and powerful performance, I give the movie two stars. If she were not in the movie, my rating would be in negative numbers. -0."
1,Comment on CONSTANTINE,"I did not like the movie as the dialogue was whispered and it was difficult to understand what was being said, and to make it even more objectionable, the audio level would overwhelm when the scene cut to an action event. The audio level had to be constantly adjusted and the picture was not very sharp even with a Hi-Def monitor. It is suggested Amazon get a limiting amplifier or one of the old CBS Audiomax units like TV broadcasters used in the 60's to prevent the commercials' audio levels from annoying the viewers. Run ALL movies through an audio processor and get this under control.Jim"
3,So-So,"Ok, you know they were going to tone down the normal Hellblazer storyline to appeal to the masses, that was expected. The story itself was ok, kept you interested, but wasn't great. Its is perplexing what they were thinking in choosing the lead character. I always thought Keefer Sutherland was perfect for the part, and would never have picked a surfer dude to play Constantine."
1,Not worth your time.,"Really bad supernatural thriller that has Keanu Reeves of all people trying to save the world from the devil and his army in a piss poor movie with a bad script and poor special effects. Reeves comes off very bad in his role and basically leaves Rachel Weisz to not only hold the audience by herself by giving the only good performance that this film has to offer but also to make them think that the movie would have been much better off with Keanu not there. Weisz's performance is the only good quality that this film has and she's so good in fact that you almost forget how bad this movie really is, int'l the script lets her and audience down with a very bad second act that not only takes apart the theme of the film but makes a mockery of it as well.Other than the good performace of Rachel Weisz, it's not worth your time."
1,Some people will watch anything...,"This movie is so bad. Not in the funny way. In the unwatchable way. I love comic book movies. I love Exorcism movies. This movie was worse than Exorcist: the Beginning. Worse than League of Extraordinary Gentlemen. Worse than The Matrix Revolutions. Bad bad bad bad bad movie. Bad acting, bad editing, bad directing, bad script. Waste not your time. You've been warned."
2,It's Ciggie time!,"About the only interesting factor in this boring, languid flick is watching Keanu lighting up an endless supply of smokes. Even in the rain, he's whipping out that good ole lighter and puffing away. Only thing is he looks and acts like someone whose never puffed anything stronger than hemp. He doesn't appear to enjoy al those ciggies. I'm around dedicated smokers all the time and when they inhale that smoke, they appear transported into a little bit of heaven. Oh, yeah, somewhere in this convuluted mess are computer generated monsters who look like they were created by a kindergarten class."
4,Go watch it!,"I have been kicking and screaming about this adaptation of Hellblazer. I read and liked the the comic books for quite a while- a couple years- and Keanu as John and Calif instead of England seemed like abominations.I got over that in about 5 minutes. If you can take the movie on its own merits, it's great. Although Keanu's character isn't John (I wish they'd just named him something else) the universe he plays in is faithful to the comic book's universe, as best I remember it.I didn't have any problem with the acting. I loved Tilda Swinton's Gabriel. I loved Lucifer. Rachel Weisz's characters left me indifferent but not so much that I thought about it during the movie. There wasn't really anyone I didn't enjoy.If you enjoy watching the chaos and ambiguity of light vs. dark, go watch this movie!"
3,"OK, but inacurate","If your 4 year old is like mine, he will quickly point out that what the book calls a pterodactyl is actually a pteranadon. otherwise it is an o.k. book. It could be a little bit longer."
3,Surprisingly Good,"I didn't expect to get much out of this book but I found myself highlighting and underlining things. It was definitely useful and I definitely recommend it. It's not just for people who want to save their marriage, it's for people who want to improve, or keep their marriage successful. And there really is no way to change your spouse so don't anticipate it will work like that."
2,Same material in yet another format...,"Basically this book is taken from where almost all ""magical psalms"" books are taken from and so is a copy with modified information. I say 'copy' because it includes the 'misspellings' of the original. If you want the original, then check out Joseph Peterson's ""Sixth and Seventh Books of Moses"" which has it in the appendix. This book is probably cheaper than Peterson's, but it includes practices with candles with the psalms which Peterson's version of the original does not (since the original does not use candles)."
1,BAH,I have never read such a terrible book in my life. Let me refer you to the excelent book by Henri Gamanche THE MASTER BOOK OF CANDLE BURNING. It is a far superior text containing much more relaiable material.
5,Great and hands on!,"I received this for Christmas and was so exited!Ive seen reviews saying it was messy and hard. I think not!A great snowy day activity. I gave 3 stars for educational value because gum and candy making can be a cool skill and gift idea for anyone. Ive also heard that the flavor is not long lasting. Really though, what gum is? Just remember to follow the directions and put down newspaper. Do that and you will have a great time!"
3,Fine Episode in Long-Running Sci-Fi Comic,"""Les Spectres d'inverloch"" [The Ghosts of Inverloch] is episode 11 of the long-running sci-fi comic strip ""Valérian, agent spatio-temporel"" which originally appeared in 1984 in the legendary French cartoon anthology, PILOTE. Together with episode 12, ""Les Foudres d'hypsis"" [The Thunder of Hypsis] (1985), this two album story arc takes future space-time agents Valérian and Laureline from contemporary Scotland to the distant planet Hypsis in the future. A series of mysterious nuclear accidents is leading towards a worldwide disaster, and the investigation leads to a mystery ship sailing the waters of the north Atlantic. The corrupt alien race the Shingouz provide key information that leads Valérian and Laureline and their allies to the cause of the crisis.Note that this album and its sequel contain some nudity."
3,Nice book but not what I ordered,"I ordered and expected the Richard Whately book, but instead received a book by the same title by Stephen F. Barker. The contents of the book look to be valuable, but it is not what I ordered."
1,"Poorly presented, no use",It just like a series of unreadable words with equations. Poorly presented with not much explanation. Waste of time.
1,BAD Crowes,I asked my friend why the Crowes couln't come up with any good songs. He said it was because they were bad songwriters.
3,Shake Your Moneymaker revisited,"Chris sounds like he's shouting at you for most of this album. The vocals lack power because of the lack of contrasting, quieter moments. For power, witness ""My Morning Song"" from the Southern Harmony album to hear the bands raw power and dynamic range. Musically, BYS is not that interesting or throw-down funky, either. Marc Ford is greatly missed. Southern Harmony was their best all-around album, IMO. Every track raises the ante, My Morning Song clears the table, and Time Will Tell sends you on your way. Amorica is fantastic, though burdened by a couple of mediocre tracks (Cursed Diamond, p.25 London). By Your Side still shines with Virtue and Vice, however."
2,Still rock but too commercial next to the others,"The guitar sound is great, the rythm is fast, but the feelings from Amorica an Three Snakes are missing. The Crowes are still the best but I miss their hippie period..."
3,Not as good as Three Snakes and One Charm,"Black Crowes still rock, but they lost the charm and grittiness of TSOC. If you want a great Crowes album get that one or Southern Harmony or even Amorica. For those new to The Crowes, I recommend Southern Harmony however. That's an easy album to love."
3,Decent but not their best,"This album is better than 3 snakes but not as good as Southern Harmony. As far as recent albums that rock, it is far inferior to the self-titled album ""Dave's Ending"" that came out in '95."
2,Not up to their standard,"Once upon a time, the Black Crowes were one of the best bands around. I thought Three Snakes... was disappointing, but I think that album is stronger than this one. The songs sound silly, with ridiculous lyrics and strained choruses that sound almost like glam-rock (Kickin' my Heart Around). If they don't turn things around, it looks like a once great band has burned out quickly."
3,Good for the money,"The Beethoven symphonies and concertos are really good for the money. I have a better 5th and 9th but these are really close. These versions are very acceptable for use in portable devices, autos and such. I would recommend them. They are what I expected and no less."
4,Charming if self serving,"Very enjoyable, although it should probably be sold paired with the McCullough biography for a more, shall we say, objective picture of the man? Good stuff though, I was fascinated by his sense of himself."
3,Not for the casual reader,"You must be interested in history and the prose of the times. We can't approach the writing etique and prose of the 18th century. How vivid was the style.For ths serious history interest only, not for the casual reader. Alan S Covington, GA"
4,autobiography of ben franklin,Good review of one of our founding fathers. A little light on info on Mr Franklins later life. I really like this book. I am sharing info with my children
3,audio...not,The 'audio' is actually just a link to a free webpage. Rip off. Can not use with my mobile phone.
2,Excellent read,A fascinating look at Franklin's life in his own voice. It is unfortunate that he did not narrate the last 30 years of his life as well.
3,Should have read at 18,I found this book very informative and felt I got a glimpse of what Ben Franklin was like. I wish I would have read this when I was 18 as I liked his plan for self improvement and concern for more then himself.
4,Good,Good biography I guess so would recommend to anyone who likes to know more about Ben Franklin. A little long though
4,Good Read for Everyone,"The autobiography of Franklin was a worthwhile book to read. I suggest ignoring the footnotes as you read his autobiography since it distracts you from reading Franklin's work. It was a good book that details how industriousness results in a wonderful, useful public life at an older age. Franklin is the type of public servant that we are lacking today."
5,American History,This will help anyone to understand what the founding fathers were going through and what they were trying to accomplish when this country was founded.
3,He just outlines highlights of his life- a so-so read,"I have great respect for Benjamin Franklin; however, this book didn't grasp my attention as much as I was hoping. He doesn't go into many details concerning his philosophies much less any background on his thoughts for inventions or the process. Franklin was very humble (as he mentions when discussing virtues he pursued) so he didn't go into details of his successes, which I understand but it made the book somewhat bland. It was well-written from a literary stance, but content-wise it was a struggle at times."
3,Dedicated to Mr. Jones,"The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin was a comical adventure through a life that expresses the ways of an ideal American. Franklin was a husband, friend, printer, inventor, scientist, writer, educator, diplomat, and a politician. Franklin's style of writing was cheerfully humorous (how his friend sucked at writing poems was my personal favorite part) and was made even better by the fact that he was able to laugh at himself. I enjoyed his take on the public's opinion of his papers on his experiments with electricity. He did not get defensive because of his cool, confident personality. I loved the part about the other scientist, Abbé Nollet, who 'could not at first believe that such a work came from America, and said it must have been fabricated by his enemies at Paris, to decry his system.' Overall the book was entertaining and a classic story, but I do not think that I would call it a favorite."
1,boring book,"so boring youll fall asleep, but ehh you get what you pay for i guess ill learn something if i read it"
1,boring,I was hoping to really get in to this but it was to boring for me. So that is why it is one star.
5,# 1 Country Singer,My all time favorite country artist. This cd has all my favorites on it. Can't get enough of Lynn Anderson.
3,"Bad Code, Okay Book","The book was instructive about Object-Oriented Neural Networks. The code is really bad, but I assumed it was because he wrote it first using STL, then was told that some people may not be able to compile it because they wouldn't know how to set up STL or because of compatibilities ... but then some things just seem lazy, like making every function inline in the hopes that inline would be ""better"" somehow.I thought the code could be forgiven if there were some UML diagrams or if there were references to patterns. The index was unusably tiny. I wished there was some place we could get code updates or other versions of the code. However, there aren't many cheap books in this area of expertise, so it is still worth looking through ... try re-writing everything in Perl or Java to get away from the bad code."
5,A very good book for those begining with Neural Networks.,"Unlike many books on similar topics, Object-Oriented Neural-Networks in C++ provides a truly object-oriented approach to the design and implementation of neural networks. This book is not only a good tool for those beginning with neural-networks giving step-by-step instructions for constructing a variety of neural network architectures, it also provides a good set of tools for the advanced neural network user to build more flexible and powerful neural-network architectures. The book covers 4 basic neural network architectures (ADALINE, Backpropagation, Self-Organizing, and BAM); however, the object foundation provided by the book can be the basis for any neural network architecture. The book contains a complete set of source code (in print and on disk) for all objects described, real-world examples, and a review of the C++ programming techniques used throughout the book"
2,High expectations fell short in the end,"Although this was the first and only Michener novel I have read, I think it was a poor choice. My expectations going into reading were quite high, but by the end of this novel I was very disappointed. The story was decent, however the plot was very thin. I had alot of trouble relating to the characters. I could not figure out if Luton was just a snob, or a real caring person that was afraid to show his emotions. The deaths were very predictable, and to be quite frank the ending just sucked! What a let down, Luton just leaves the same day he gets to Dawson like he is supposed to be some kind of hero or something. Luton just made me angry the whole story especially the way he treated Fogerty, at the end I am very surprised he paid for his telegram. Definitely not the greatest book in the world."
5,Great product for separation anxiety!,"This really seems to work on my ten month old Beagle baby.He has severe separation anxiety while we are at work, and this product calms him. I will continue to use it!! Thanks!!"
5,"Good, Good, Good",It's gotta be said if you're a Cramps fan then you'll love this off beat collection of foot stomping beats!
1,Did not work,"The service was great no issues, the product just did not work for me. The package got to me just fine; so I hate to give a bad review. It was like chapstick and it made the tip sore, but thats it, maybe I used it wrong."
2,Wart stick,"Convenient to use, but doesn't work near as well as liquid. Also it's the size of lip gloss sticks, so hard to confine to smaller area."
2,Acid based,"Too strong to use on my dog. After trying it on me, I stopped. Too much acid. Not good. Sorry"
1,WORTHLESS,"THIS IS A TYPICAL ""BS"" PRODUCT! IT DOES NOT DO ANYTHING TO CURE THE WARTS, SO I DO NOT KNOW WHAT IT IS FOR. DO NOT BUY IT"
1,"Maybe ok for warts, not for skin tags.","Received this and rubbed it on a few skin-tags twice a day for 8 days - no change to the skin tag. No change to color, texture or size. It did absolutely nothing for my skin tags.I will try it again if I ever get a wart."
5,A miracle in a stick,I had purchased my wart stick at a liquidators store so I didn't know what I was really getting. I had a painful wart on the ball of my foot which I had been trying to remove for some time with various methods. I used the stick and the wart was gone in a very short time. I was impressed. It was gone for a year and now it is back and I started using the wart stick again and than misplaced the stick. I just found it in my medicine cabinet. I am bookmarking this item on my computer. I want to know that I can always have this item if I need it. It really works and fast!!!!!!!!!!
3,This is a cool cd but nothing amazing...,Although I am glad that I finally have Hall n Oats CLASSIC 'I Can't Go For That' this cd is not a DJ set or a studio album its simply songs that have inspired them. They obviously did take time putting it together since every song has a little story about why its meaningful to who its meaningful etc. Get it if you like the track list but don't expect a mix or original material.
5,Jack Gilbert- Monolithios,"This is one of the most beautiful books of modern poetry out there. I am so sad that it's out of print. The poems, which span a period of time in which Jack Gilbert got a divorce and moved to Greece, are extreemly emotional and expertly crafted."
1,The film is phenomenal this particular copy is horrible,"While Godard's classic, breathless, is undeniably one of the greatest films ever made, the version released from the International Film Series is nearly unwatchable. It is terribly overexposed, washing out much of the picture detail, and making most of the white-on-white subtitles impossible to read. In addition, (I am unsure if this is unique to my particular copy) the video tends to ghost, and in places appears pink with a moving vertical (this is definately not a tracking problem, rather a glitch with the copy of the film this tape was recorded from). I would recommend this film to anyone, however it might be best to purchase the other version."
2,Looked cool :(,"I am an avid ps2 gamer. I purchased this from a local store because of its apparent convenience. Was I ever wrong. The device has a battery indicator on it with 4 bars. When the batteries go down to 3 bars, I have a very sporadic connection to my ps2 (my ps2 is only 10ft away). After a while of playing Everquest Online, this became very annoying and inconvenient. After a month, I ditched this and bought a cable extender. Another expensive lesson. :("
3,Thinline?,"Okay, perhaps this may seem a bit anal, but since thinline is in the title I feel as if I should say that it is NOT less than 1 inch thick (despite what it says in the description). Even while pressing this Bible firmly down on the table it measures 1 3/16 inches thick. If, like me, you bought this because you really liked the size of a previous thinline Bible you might be a bit disappointed. Also, I have a few other trutone covered books that I like much better (the Greek and Hebrew Reader's Bibles). Those are softer to the touch and a bit more grippy than this cover which has a pebbled finished. Additionally, I did not realize that this has no cross-references (although the description doesn't say it does).On the plus side this Bible does have a few extras that are helpful such as generous map section, and pictures of Jerusalem (Old and New, ect), the temple, tabernacle, etc. And of course, the ESV is a pretty solid translation."
4,"Good Read: Informative, Funny, Truthful","I picked up this book because I wanted to read a first-hand account of what's going on in Iraq. If you are looking for a book full of combat and killing people, this book is not for you. There is combat and gunfire in the book, but it is much more than that. Hartley talks about things as trivial as getting lost in Humvees to difficult issues such as dealing with the death of a friend. The book is what you would expect from an infantryman but at the same time rather philosophical at times. A good read."
4,Loads of Fun,"We got this item for our 9 month old son. He absolutely loves the ball pit; however, you will want more than 50 balls. The whole family can have fun, even our dog loves to race through the tunnels."
4,Great tents and tunnels! Kids loved it!,Our grandchildren love the tents and tunnels along with the 40 plastic balls that came with it. I bought 100 more balls based on previous reviews and that was a good thing. Also love how it can be dissambled very easily and stored flat!
3,It's ok.,I thought there would be a better mechanism to keep the pieces together. The little ties didn't hold up very long. But our son still has a great time with it.
4,Grandma and Grandpa wanted to spoil the kids,"I have 3 yr old boy/girl twins who enjoyed this product greatly for about 2 months of occasional use. (I work outside of the home and the only time they could use it was evenings) The fabric began tearing and coming off of the frame almost immediately. I put the tunnels away for future play and salvaged one of the smaller cubes. I'd expect this wear and tear from more active kids; mine didn't even jump around in it, just threw balls at each other! We were very disappointed!"
3,Good but not durable enough for outside,"This is a very fun product for kids. The tunnels and ball pit are great. However, I really do not see how this can be easily used outdoors as it is not sturdy enough to stand on its own if there is wind etc."
5,Not Only for the 3-7 Ages,"Just recieved my daughters Mega Tent this morning and had a hard time getting her out of it for bedtime! I have more balls on order and waiting to recieve, because it DOES need more to have the real ""ball room"" effect..50 doesn't cut it. My daughter is going to be 21 months and she's having a ball with this. I even took the tents and separted them into different rooms and one outside since it is too big for our livingroom put all together. And I attached them all together in a straight line so it WOULD fit one of the rooms we have and it worked out fine. I only wish that the two smaller tents had the plastic lining on the flooring like the biggest one does, so she couldn't crawl out from the bottom and get tangled in it when it tips over or the balls wouldn't escape if I put them in one of them. So much fun, I haven't been able to put it back in the bags they come with..so I don't know how hard it is to fold back up yet..but the instructions look easy enough. Thanks!"
4,make sure you wash the balls first,"We bought the Megaland for our niece and she loved it. At night she put one of her favorite dolls in the ""ball room"" of the megaland and in the morning when she took the doll out of the balls the face of the doll was covered in blue marks. When you play with the blue balls the dye comes off and now her favorite doll is covered in blue ink that doesnt come off. We even tried acitone to get the ink off and that didnt even work.So word to the wise clean the balls and dry them before you put them in the ball room."
1,Makes Proust read like Elmore Leonard,"This has to be one of the most over-written books in any genre. I could not believe the amount of space wasted in wordy, directionless exposition. The author should be cited by the EPA for the hapless trees that needed to be sacrificed to print this junk. Police work has never seemed so boring. The events in this book are built on coincidence and the lethargic will of the author; the investigators do nothing except stand around, talk in copspeak and react to the next transition in plot-which seems light years away to the reader. I truly cannot believe the number of people who rated this book highly. In one of Kirkus' other reviews, they equate Lindsey to Le Carre, a comparison that might ring true if Le Carre was drugged and beat about the head with a hammer before being positioned in front of his typewriter. Mercy blows more hot air than its Houston setting."
1,Worst toy ever,"Let me count the ways that this is a horrible toy:If you put an egg in the carton wrong end down it can get VERY stuck and what kid knows to put the skinny end down?The case is flimsy plastic.The carton says 18 months+ but it is a choking hazard for kids under 3...hmmm.The ""quote"" on the side is supposedly by a 2 year old - ""With the Egg-Shape Sorter learning my shapes was over easy!"" - what 2 year old says that!!"
3,"Love the concept, wish they were better made","The concept of this toy is great...the sorting/matching and pretend play -- all of my kids 5, 4, and 1 love this toy. I do wish the quality of the product was better -- then I would give it 5 stars all the way. The case is filmsy, and more importantly the eggs are really hard to come apart - even for me. They don't always seem to align up right when you stick them together (for me) and I attribute it to poor quality."
2,Cute but cheap and poorly made,"I wanted some toy eggs for my daughter since we keep hens (for the eggs) and these looked cute. When they arrived though, there was mysterious dust (not just dust from shipping, it was silvery and smelled odd) in and on the carton and it had little plastic shavings coming off all over it that there was no way I would give it to my daughter to put in her mouth. These toy eggs are the epitome of cheaply made plastic goods so I returned this item and paid the few dollars more for the Tomy Hide n' Squeak Eggs, which are MUCH better."
4,Good buy.,"I just bought this item and like it. Everything works great. It only goes 42"" high, but I believe it is good compared to other travel tripods."
3,Introduction to the breed with general dog care advice,"For the price, this book covers enough of the basics of the breed to give you an idea if the dog is worth a more-detailed research. The 'care guide' section (which takes up about 1/3 of the book) is very general, it can apply to any dog. This book alone is not enough for any serious research. If you're seriously considering the Great Pyrenees as a pet you will need a better reference book, like The New Complete Great Pyrenees, also found via Amazon."
5,A Great Introduction To The Environment For Children,"The message is simple, and the illustrations stunning. This is a great way to introduce children to environmental issues and concerns. I have found that this book is also hard to find. Love the art work by Roy Vickers."
4,The best Scooter song so far.,"When you listen to this track you will be glad becouse it's so much power in it,just listen to the extract from James Brown is dead. Makes you wanna go up from the chair and dance,right? Just three words to say 'BUY THIS SINGEL'"
2,The handheld version is just ok..,"The handheld version with 4 answer buttons does not compare to it's big brothers. The deluxe versions have more answer buttons to help tailor the answers better than the handheld one, so it seems to be a bit smarter. I would go with the deluxe versions instead of the handheld..."
4,20Q - Toy / Learning tool,"My kid loved this toy. She spent hours on end trying different scenarios. She even takes it with her on the Airplane for trips. I was a little frustrated the first couple times, but it was still fun and entertaining to see the ball beat you."
4,Amazing!,"We got our 10 year old this for Christmas. It has managed to amaze friends and family ever since. Luckily, someone else also bought her one for Christmas, so we have 2 in the house! More often than not, both are in use.Great gift!"
2,Not as smart as the website it's based on!,"I was thrilled when I heard about this toy, because I love the website 20q.net , which is truly genius. Unfortunately this toy is not as smart as the website, perhaps due to memory constraints. The first two things I tried with it were ""a cardboard box"" and ""an alien"" and it didn't get either one. This is troublesome because the surprise and wonder of using the website comes from its ability to guess even the most obscure and outlandish things (a stork, a game boy). This toy cannot guess those things, so you must ask guests to choose more obvious things, taking the fun out of it. [...]."
3,Childhood treasure to watch,I was happy to find this movie in DVD format! Been a long time since I had seen this and I can safely say now this was a fun dvd to find in the mail.
2,Fun but a bit dangerous,"My 3-year-old son loves his bed. It is sturdy and attractive. However, as other reviewers have noted, the sides and foot of the bed have edges that vary from sharp to very sharp. My son has injured himself twice, once getting a rather large cut and goose egg on his forehead, and once getting a fat bloody lip. It would be just as easy to round the edges or apply a soft molding. I can't understand why this wasn't done. Until the design is changed, I would not recommend this bed for this reason."
4,Cars wooden toddler bed,"My great grandson loves his new car bed. he invites Everyone who visits his house to see his car bed. He only talks in few word sentences but explains the numbers the tires the lights.His Parents are pleased with the bed also. At first they were not so sure because he wanted to drive (make car sounds). when they ignored him after tuck in and stories, he often drove himself to sleep.A good Purchase.James"
2,Not comfortable and dangerous for a toddler!,I bought this bed an year ago but after the second night he slept on it I decided it was not safe for him.The bed is way too small for a toddler specially if he moves a lot during sleep.The sides of the bed are very hard and he can hurt his arms on even his head if he bangs on either side of the bed.I am wondering if this bed even follow Association's standards for safety.My advise: spend some more money and buy a safer bed!
3,What's in a house?,"Forton Hall ... not your typical country mansion (I'll let you discover why) ... home to Felicity Harrington (our lovely leading lady), is lost in a wager by Felicity's 'dimwitted' brother, Nigel, to Rafe Bancroft: scoundrel, and rake extraordinaire.Unfortuantely, due to a ""mishap"" with a kettle, Rafe and Felicity's first meeting doesn't go quite as Rafe plans ... needless to say, after much laughter (for the reader), Rafe and Felicity come to an agreement about Forton Hall and their new found relationship ..... the plot thickens and there is an ""evil"" hand from an unexpected corner!A most enjoyable and worthwhile read. I find Suzanne E's writing style fluid, funny, and truly enjoyable.You are unlikely to dislike this one, Kristina"
5,A KEEPER!,"This is only the second book I read by Suzanne Enoch. I wasn't sure if she was a flash in the pan when I read ""Reforming A Rake."" To my relief, she wasn't because I loved ""Taming Rafe"" as much ""RAR."" Her characters show a great deal of vulnerability and the story is told in the eyes of both hero and heroine which I enjoy...too many of the romance books are told through the eyes of the heroine only. I am going to find more of her books since I enjoyed these two so much."
4,"Plenty of goodies, but also some aridities","I found it crowded with good advice and ideas. I also found myself skipping and jumping around in it after a while, and putting it down altogether, because it was getting a bit tedious. But I would leave it lying in a visible place and pick it up again some evenings later. And every time I picked it up I found good and valuable advice in it. There are headings and subheadings on just about every page and the text under them is more or less self-contained: so it's amenable to browsing (chapter 1 excepted). And believe me, it has a huge amount of content. One of the things I like is its stated intention to make you a happier developer, not just a better developer. The causes of developer suffering and confusion are predominantly management and human issues, needless to say, since the machine and machine tools continue to be on their best behavior. The book has helped me avoid some suffering and confusion. It is not B.S."
3,Interesting perspective.,"This book has an interesting outlook on software development. Beware it is 'the sociology of computer programming' as it says in the title - only read it if this is of interest to you. For this reason it delves into the reasons why people build software the way they do and provides the framework into which all the engineering methods and methodologies fit.However, it's too tedious in places and contains too many hollow platitiudes despite parts being built on what appears to be a sound academically researched foundation. Pick it up if you have room for a book to round out your engineering expertise but don't expect the kind of experience as in reading 'Design Patterns' for the first time, for example."
2,"Not working most of the time, worse than my neighbor's $15 unit",Not picking up signals consistantly.TV Frequently goes into 'Signal Not Found' mode.My Neighbor has $15 UHF Antenna from GE(i think)which works much better in consistency and signal quality.
3,nothing special,"I bought this because the rabbit ear antenna I have didn't get all the channels, but it turns out that the rabbit ear antenna with the UHF circular antenna received more channels than this antenna. Wouldn't recommend this product."
1,Awful...I should have listened to the other reviews.,The battery is the problem. I wish I just stayed with conventional walkie-talkies for my sons. Stay away from this product until they fix the problem.
5,son loves this backpack,my son had 2 walmart backpacks and they kept ripping within the first week of high school so we decided to get him a jansport we let him pick it out and he loves it hasnt had any problems with it since hes had it and amazon was the cheapest place that we could find itmy son is now a senior in high school and still using the same back pack will never buy another cheap backpack again
4,Good book,Good introductory book for VB.NET. After reading this book read Francesco Balena's Programming Visual Basic.NET.This will give you a good starting point to VB.NET with small and clear examples..
1,"Stupid book, geared towards morons.","This book is a joke! It covers different stories told supposedly by women in Exotic positions, such as strippers, prostitutes and porn stars. The stories are very well made up, at least the author has a creative mind. All it really talks about is the hundreds of lovers these women take on, nothing else."
3,Good TrinBago foods.,"Good TrinBago recipes, but there are still many good traditional recipes missing. I also remembered so many of my mums recipes from my childhood. Apart from that the book is OK for a newcomer to Trinidadian and Tobagoian cooking. How lucky we are as a nation, to have such an infusion of different cultural influences of cooking skills.Unfortunately, (now I am being fussy), the photographs don't depict the true ethnicity of Trinidad and Tobago, those of us from these twin islands will look at these photos and agree with me.But hey! all books will always be bias in some way or the other. Happy cooking!!"
3,Burns my eyes,"Seems like a good idea, and it might make a good bath soap, but I purchased it for my face, thinking olive oil would be great. And maybe it is, but there must be some other harsh chemicals in the soap because it burns my eyes when I wash."
5,Squeaky clean.,I like to use this if I want no residue on my skin. You would think olive oil would be greasy but it is anything but. I do need to follow up with lotion during the dry months or switch to a shea butter based product. My hubby loves this product.
5,MY ALL TIME FAVORITE,"25 years after reading this book for the first time, I STILL love this book as much as I did the first time I read it. The characters are warm and real and the story still inspires me. I have given a copy of this book to every young girl in my life and everyone of them has been thrilled once they have read it. I re-read this book at least once a year and it has a treasured place of honor among my collection of girlhood favorites."
5,This is the BEST book I have ever read!!,"First of all I would like to say that this book deserves A LOT more than just 5 stars. It deserves the whole sky full of stars,.... and then some!I started reading this book for an assignment in 7th grade and had one week to read it. I didn't get it done though but I loved it very much. Two years later I found it at a library and decided to start reading it again. I got finished with the whole thing and I don't think I'll ever find a book better than it! It just touched the bottom of my heart and it made me cry when I got to the last chapter of it and I would recomend this book to anyone especially people who don't like reading because this would teach them that there really are totally AWESOME books out there and I would say that this is the #1 book in the world!!"
4,Really enjoyed this one!,"This book was assigned reading for a book club that I'm in, and I am glad it was or I may have overlooked it. The reflections of the main character, Francie, create what for me is a whole other world; kind of a real-life science fiction. This is better than sci-fi or fantasy, though, because it is a glimpse of a real time & place that existed nearly a century ago. Betty Smith writes from the heart about a place that, while holding no appearant beauty to outsiders, is glorious in the author's recollections. It also reminds readers of what the ""American Dream"" is really made of. The situations are wrought with love, and the characters are very real, multi-dimensional people. I would especially recommend this book to women of all ages."
1,Boredom in a Box,"I have never been as bored in my life as much as I was when I was forced to read ""A Tree Grows In Brooklyn"" during my Freshman year of High School. It was absolutley HORRIBLE. There basically is no plot, just some idiot girl rambling about this and that, her parents, the trees, the house, some stupid aunt of hers...."
5,"The best book I've ever read, and I've read a lot of books","I loved all the surprises and turns in the story. I could really see myself as the girl. The discription was wonderful. If you ever read a book, this should be it."
3,A Tree Grows in Brooklyn,"This widely praised novel by Betty Smith is heartfelt, but frankly boring. The main plot follows an Irish-Austrian-American girl as she grows up in a slum in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. Subplots focus on her family members. There is a lot of nostalgic detail on life at the beginning of the twentieth century, and I imagine that this book would appeal to people who grew up at that time... but there are few such people alive. Other themes include the cruelty of people to one another, the rapaciousness of private enterprise, and female strength and resilience. This wasn't a bad book but there wasn't enough of a plot to keep my interest, and eventually it became a chore to read."
5,Deserves more stars that I can give,"I read this book for the first time when I was 11 years old, and it has since been my favourite book for years."
5,The best book I've ever read!,"This book is one of the greatest books of all time! I completely relate to Francie, not in an exact, economical sense, but as a 15-year-old girl; I have gone through the same emotional situations as Francie. She is a modern heroine who does not rely on anyone except for her own strength and will to survive. The lavish descriptions about her family's life will touch the heart of any reader. Betty Smith must have been a genius to come up with such a compelling, heart-warming story in a time when such graphic images of poverty were condemned."
5,This is a fantastic book about change and growing up.,"Anyone who is lucky enough to read this wonderful book is sure to love it. The Nolan family lives in a poor neighborhood of Brooklyn at the turn of the century. Although their mother, Katie, works hard, sometimes they can barely scrape up enough money for food. For the Nolans everyday life is a challenge. But, everyday they wake up with a new strength, looking for what the new day will bring. Francie, whom the book mainly focuses on, is the oldest. she is very imaginative and smart, and learns a lot about her self over the course of the book. As Francie and her younger brother, Neeley grow older the world around them changes rapidly, as do they. This book is an excellent book about change and the relationships between family members."
4,A very touching story..,"I just completed reading this book for my monthly book review group. I really wanted to give the book five stars, and the only reason I didn't was because when I first started reading it, I had a hard time staying with it through the first few chapters. Once I got into the book, I couldn't put it down. I think perhaps Betty Smith was ahead of her time in her writing. The book had mistakes, but they were few and far between. I thought Smith did an excellent job of portraying her characters and I felt a warm connection to each one of them. When Smith describes how the family lived in poverty and the buying coal for the stove, I remembered my own childhood and the hard times my own family had. I recommend this book to anyone. Francie will win your heart, your respect, your sympathy and well...there's not much more to say, I really loved the book."
4,A GOOD READ FOR YOUNG GIRLS,"THIS IS ONE BOOK THAT I KNEW THAT I SHOULD HAVE READ LONG BEFORE NOW. IT HAS BEEN ON MY MUST-READ LIST FOR A LONG TIME. THIS IS DEFINITELY A BOOK THAT ALL YOUNG WOMEN SHOULD READ. EVEN THOUGH IT WAS SET IN THE EARLY 1900'S, SOME THINGS STILL APPLY TO OUR TIMES. IT WAS ALSO INTERESTING TO COMPARE LIFESTYLES THEN AND NOW. I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS BOOK"
4,A Review of A Tree Grows in Brooklyn,"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn is the story of Francie Nolan, her brother Neeley and all of the people who live with them in Brooklyn. It is sort of a documentary of Francie's growing up. This book has so much detail and excitement that it is hard not to understand, although it may seem complicated when you first pick it up. This is a good book for people age 10 and up, and is the perfect book to buy for the ummer- it would be ideal to bring to a cottage or on a camping trip. Altogether, this is a fantastic book that you don't want to miss."
3,Mixed feelings,"I have mixed feelings about this book. It is so depressing and made me so sad that I wish I'd never read it. (The mother's rejection of Francie while deeply loving the little brother still haunts me, probably because I see the same situation occurring in a child who is close to me.) On the other hand, it must be very well written to invoke such deep emotions for me."
5,"Love the book, but...","I recently read A Tree Grows in Brooklyn for the first time. I loved it. If I had to compare it to another book to someone else, I would say it compares to Angela's Ashes, though I enjoyed this one more.I did not like this particular book though because it has rough cut pages where the each page edge is different. I just don't care for that, and had I known that this edition was like that, I would have bought a different copy.But you can't go wrong with the book."
5,It will change your outlook on life!,"Amazing book.The characters are vivid and full of life, the story is one-of-a-kind, and Betty Smith writes with beautiful language incorporating theme, style, and song lyrics to top it all off. As a 16-year-old reader, I fully appreciated what I learned from this book.. I learned to appreciate life and to embrace it with all I have. Perhaps you will learn something different, something more meaningful to you. I strongly suggest ""A Tree Grows in Brooklyn,"" as I regret I hadn't read it sooner."
2,A Tree Grows in Brooklyn,"This book was 9th grade honors English required reading...our teachers beat it to death, and it was really awful anyway. The book was boring, pointless, and plotless, until towards the end. I would not reccommed it."
4,"Not the ""meatiest"" book I've ever read!","Our Book Club chose this book as a ""classic"" read. I remember reading it as a teenager and I believe that's who it appeals to. While I enjoyed reading it, I wouldn't say it has a lot of discussion value."
5,A Lifetime Favorite,My Mom gave me this book to read when I was very young. Actually I have one of the first publications of it. I have read this book a number of times over the years and never get tired of the characters and the story. Reminds us that recycling actually did begin a long time ago when during the depression kids would take wagons full of things to recycle to get pennies for bread. A beautiful story I will read again and again. So happy to have it on my Kindle now.
2,this quartet sucks,"I don't know why these guys decided to do a CD inthe first place. I have a quartet that's been togetherfor 3 years and we've placed as high as 4th in theRocky Mountain District of SPEBSQSA competition. Wecould sing any one of the songs on the CD better thanthese guys. Do not buy this album. Go to the SPEBSQSAweb site (http://www.spebsqsa.org) and buy albums bythe number one quartets in the US. I don't know thisgroup, but they need some serious coaching. It's a poorexample of what Barbershop harmony is all about."
5,Great for repelling rabbits,This product was received in just a coupledays. It works great as a fertilizer and has been trhe only thing we havew found to keep rabbits out of the garden.
3,Disappointed ... need longer bolts.,"Very hard to set up, difficult to anchor securely, confusing instructions. It took 2 days to set up this product. Had to run to local HomeDepot store to get longer eye bolts, because ones that came with this product could not be used for set up."
3,backyard climber,"I bought this climber for my 2 children, ages 28 and 14 months, 2 weeks ago. It is a nice climber, but not for the price and my kids don't play with it as much as I thought they would. The age recommendation was 3 to 6 years, but I think 2 to 4 is more like it. My cousins came over to play on it, they are 4 and 6 years old, and they looked way to big to be playing on it. Putting it together wasn't too bad. I did need a hand with the swing extension. Overall, I am disappointed. My kids love the park and love climbing on everything, but this doesn't hold their interest."
4,The Principle of Relativity,"This book presents Einstein's orginal papers on relativity along with many other ""classics"" on the subject. A good understanding of college math and physics is a must."
5,Finest book if you can deal with maths,"If you are serious about relavity, read this book and no other. It has original papers from Einstein and others, and they are not as difficult as they say they are. In fact, since Einstein mentions everything in full detail, he sounds much more convincing and clearer than all those authors who hide intricate details of the subject.This book is not for you unless you want to get to the fine MATHEMATICS of it. If you are serious about relativity, then you must get the mathematics too. And if you want mathematics too, get this book."
3,"important insights, but a slow, redundant read","I'm still working my way through this book. Based on some of the reviews I saw here, I bought it.So far, the first section of the book has been terrible redundant, with one paragraph reiterating the one above it. The main point (I can save you 100 pages of reading here) is that induction cannot be the holy grail is is purported to be because just because something happened in the past does not mean it will happen in the future. Expect to see that point restated dozens of times. Okay, I get it!The second section has started to pick up, moving through the Ptomely, Copercinuus debates and into Newton. His perspectives and insights are interesting. But if you're like me, this will be a few-page-a-night sort of read. I'll get back to you as I progress..."
4,CUTE SHIRT-runs a tad small :),"This shirt is awesome and got here just in time for my son's birth! :) The shirt is good quality, and though it runs a little small, fits quite well :)"
2,Waylon and friends,This DVD is not good. It's to short 43min. and including many songs in playback. To much talk and few songs.
3,Disappointed in the Interpretations,"My wife and I are big fans of Kristofferson's writings, acting roles, and accomplishments in general, i.e., Rhodes Scholar, etc. (We definitely think his song writing covers up his lack of sing capability.)We are also fans of many of the artists that have sung his songs past and present. There in lies our disappointment. The treatment of these songs by many of the artists on this album sounded like more of a favor to the artists...not the song writer.TOOOOO bad."
1,almost useless,"If this isn't ueless, it's certainly misleading. Read the previous review, and don't bother downloading it for your Kindle."
4,New zombie books,"This is an awesome novel. It reminds me of Julie Rayzor Romance, Adevnture, Zombies. Both are good books. Even for a first person novel there are a lot of ""I""s. I did this. I saw that. Other than that it is interesting. Julie Rayzor is first person also.."
1,ehhhhhhhh...,"I kept waiting for something interesting to happen, and it really never did. There was a total lack of character development, and even less plot development. I'm buying the second book to see if the characters die.."
3,Seriously?,"Okay, so this is a pretty good book but I can't believe people PAID for it. It was a free download on the internet for years!"
2,Not Like Romero,I didn't care for this one very much. The zombies weren't very scary and the whole thing just kind of fell into a rut.
2,Chrome Revolving Shoe Tree,The slots for shoes are too close. You can't put more than 3 pair on each tier.
1,Rickety and cheap,"I thought this thing was great when I first bought it... then I used it for a few months. The stem now always lilts to one side, so that it leans against the wall of my closet, or toward the door. It also doesn't turn easily after a while. This is just one of those crap pieces that works out of the box, but wasn't built to last. Buyers beware!"
1,came without proper clamps,I purchased the item as a gift for my wife. It seemed really good and sturdy when I took it out of the box. When I assembled it(which was very easy) I found that there was no bracket for one connecting section. The item is very unstable and has fallen over and broken apart several times. I have no response from the supplier on getting a new clamp.
3,Weird...!,"This was weird--clearly, all brand-new chrome parts, and hardware, in sealed bags or plastic wraps. THE BASE? obviously used: filthy, gouged, and nicked! I had to scrub it, and affix thick, padded floor protectors--it would have DESTROYED the hardwood floor! (Did'nt want to spend half the price of the item,returning something so heavy..the base is where all the weight is) Aside from that, I think I'll be happy with it, it is definitely a space saver...."
5,Percy Faith Broadway Bouquet/Country Bouquet,"This is about the best cd I've heard by Percy Faith.This cd contains a lot of hard to find songs by this artist such as For the good times,The most beautiful girl,I see your eyes before me and Help me make it through the night just to name a few.These are the songs that beautiful music stations used to play and you couldn't find them on cd until this cd come out.The most beautiful girl is the country version that Charlie Rich made popular,not the broadway version the most beautiful girl in the world.This is strictley instrumental with lush strings as is every song on this cd.One more song I must mention is Annie's song.This is one of the most beautiful versions I've ever heard.You can't go wrong with this cd if you like beautiful music especially now since you can't find it on the radio anymore."
1,"Save your money, don't buy this dryer.","I bought this dryer on October 15, received it on October 23 and on November 9 the plug started to overheat and burn after 5 minutes of use. The settings at which the plug started to smoke were: medium speed and hot temperature. Also, I did not use it daily... as you can see nothing too harsh or unexpected for a hair dryer. I am returning it to Amazon ASAP and hope I can get my money back. I don't want a replacement... one bad experience is enough for me. Just as a hint if you are thinking of buying a Vidal Sassoon dryer: If their products have so many negative reviews and unsatisfied costumers it is not a coincidence, obviously the Vidal Sasson brand has serious quality management issues. I thought about this, but went an bought this dryer any way. I was a sucker for the price and free shipping I should have just gone with my initial mistrust and bought something else. I hope this does not happen to you."
5,State of Play,"The series is riveting, dramatic and suspenseful, everything American television is not. The series is believable, the actors ply their craft with a passion not often seen or experienced on out small screen.Thoroughly enjoyable and I will be looking for more of this to enjoy."
3,A good selection does not mean a broad one...,"This album is finer than the last in that it has a La Gioconda excerpt which I cannot find anywhere else, which troubles me. The ""Di tale amor"" and ""O mio babbino caro"" share the same story as well. The other stuff is bland and unintereting."
2,Nostalgia??,"I guess I was looking for a better result than I got. It did do the job and the hot dogs were adequate, but the buns were a different story (too dry and stale)."
5,Awesome product!,This product was exactly what we were looking for to use at my daughter's birthday party. The kids loved being able to pull a hot dog from the unit themselves and loved the taste of the franks right off this unit.
2,very dissapoined,"item shuts off before cooking correctly, 10 mins in bun warmer turns buns crunchy, item has been re-released so maybe that one is better."
5,Hot Diggity Dog!,"I love this machine for one simple reason: it's easy enough to use that my 5 year old daughter is now able to make dinner for us. This was a great purchase. The hot dogs cook evenly and the buns get nice and warm. You can turn the heat down after the dogs are done cooking and let them spin on low heat until you are ready for another. I was nervous when I got it that I'd bring it home and it would be made cheaply and break easily, but no... this is a quality product. I am very happy with it. My daughter and her friends love this machine and it makes making lunch a breeze. I haven't used the gridle feature, but I don't really care about that. This is a great hot dog maker. End of story."
1,HORRIBLE!!,"this toy is fun if your going to use it for making music and sound effects and stuff like that. I WOULD NOT GIVE THIS TOY TO ANY1 OVER 10. i got it for its iPod speaker capability and it was horrible!!!!!!! iz's eyEs move and make an annoying noise, and its ""funny"" comments occur sooooo often during the song that it is impossible to tell what you're listening to. IZ's basically one of those toy babys in a cool covering. it farts, it burps, it annoys the heck out of you."
5,great product.,Holds more weight than most armbands and has dual chambers. Made it easier to deflate casually as my daughter learned how to keep her self floating more. Of course if you over inflate or have a cement deck they will split or get holes but over the course of 4 summers I only purchased 6 pairs. I would consider that a pretty good track record for the extended swimming season we have here.
4,Classic Gordon!,"I don't see anything wrong with this album. It has everything that I want from a Gordon Lightfoot album: love, nature, longing, and beautiful music. Listen to it again!"
2,not for a two year old,"This is probably a great toy but i got it for my two year old and it was rather confusing and he was never interested in it. Also, it is a little confusing to me. Does that sound dense? I would say this puzzle is for a five year old and up. it might be fun to drive around the cars but they are always turning upside down, etc. which ads to the confusing nature of it."
5,An excellent and comprehensive introduction,"This book provides a very accessible introduction to a topic that is often confusing to newcomers. It introduces the concepts and equations of oceanography in a step-by-step manner, with self-quizzes and problems to assist the reader in grasping the concepts. The book is good for people exploring an education in oceanography, or for people who are not oceanographers but need to understand the concepts for their own research. The book takes you from being a novice to understanding the different issues, terminology, and methods of data presentation typical of the field. A grasp of the material puts you in a position to dive into the oceanographic literature and pull out the information relevant to your own field of study."
1,Simply More Garbage,"As advised in another review, after ""Kildar"", there ""action"" moves further and further away - with each succeeding book - away from The Valley (Kildar's personal little feudal kingdom).Rather than ""re-invent the wheel"", would simply point readers to my other (1-star) my reviews in this series of trash (and poor writing at that!)JR was so much better when involved in co-authoring books with well renown top level Sci-Fi authors. Upon striking out on his own, he has simply been terrible (and doesn't seem to be drawing too many well renown top level Sci-Fi authors ""knocking his door down"" to do futuer co-authored books together... not since the Kildar series!)"
1,Over-rated,"Just did not work for me. The ease of application is great, but it ends there. You might as well not have applied it."
4,Old dog teaches new tricks,"There's not a bum note on this album. Wayne gets together with members of Bad Religion, Claw Hammer, the Melvins and others in the MC5 appreciation society to create some serious R-O-C-K. ""Crack in the Universe,"" ""Bad Seed,"" ""Pillar of Fire"" all sound like classics Kramer and Co. pull out of a hat, while ""Poison"" revisits that old panic in Detroit. There's a junkie's nod to Johnny Thunders, some sartorial silliness (""Sharkskin Suit""), even some spoken-word drama. And the sly album packaging echoes the classy jazz look of Blue Note, with an old-school liner note appreciation by Henry Rollins. Don't forget to turn it up!"
5,Brilliant brain scientist,"This doctor will take you to an insight into the brain like you have never thought before. He is the quintessential, cutting edge researcher into the brain,his work is scholarly and original."
5,Classroom response,"As a high school IB Biology teacher I showed this video as part of a unit on the brain. Students were most taken with Case #1: Phanton Limb. I followed the case with two hands on exercises (from the teaching materials) that allow students to experience phantom sensations. I ended the lesson with a reading called ""The Man Who Fell Out of Bed"" from an Oliver Sachs book, followed by the online actvitiy ""Probe the Brain"" (PBS) which simulates the Penfield sensory motor cortex findings. A very stimulationg little lesson!"
5,Foot Cream,My podiatrist recommended this product. Does a wonderful job of keeping feet free of dry skin. Not greasy...readily absorbs into skin.
5,You need this CD.,"Seriously. If you are looking at this page of Amazon it would be hard to believe you are unaware of SNZ, and being aware of such, as unfortunately esoteric as that may be, your surely asking yourself, ""Is this solo effort on par with the aforementioned sonic greatness?"". Indeed it is. Buy it."
3,Be careful that you are ordering the correct item,This timer does NOT plug in to a normal residential outlet. One of the two upper prongs in oriented horizontally [instead of vertically] and therefore it will not work in most homes.
5,2 on-off cycles 20 amp T-slot type outlet,"As described, it works, should work for a while. Can be manually switched to the opposite cycle (on /off) but only until timer trips it again. Very bare-bones but if you want 20 amp or the T-slot this is it."
4,A brief overview,"I am a big fan of the music by Tota K.K from the Animal Crossing series. I expected to get all of KK's songs, but only got a handful. Turns out, this was a soundtrack to the movie Animal Crossing. It is not a bad product if you are the fan of the movie, I was only bummed because it did not have the songs I expect it to have!"
1,So-so,"It would have been a great family movie if it didn't have the sex scene's (they're benign for older children, but too much for the under 12 crowd). No one over 12 would call this a good movie. The script is weak and predictable; the direction is terrible."
2,"Interesting forensics, but flawed story","I couldn't warm up to the character of Tempe Brennan. Something false about her. There were too many coincidences to make the plot plausible. Connecting the murders she stumbled upon in North Carolina to the murders in Quebec was enough of a stretch, but then throwing her sister into the thick of things was one coincidence too many. The detailed forensics were interesting to an extent, but not interesting enough to make up for the story problems."
1,Summer bore!,"When I purchased this book, I had completely forgotten that I had read ""Deja Dead"" two years before. It took 3 weeks to plough through this slow moving novel and I was tempted several times to just put it away. Her knowledge of forensics is commendable (she is an expert after all), but her knowledge of how to utilize plot and character needs much improvement. Needless to say, that is an art form of its own."
5,Great Read,If you like the TV series you should read the books - so far this one is my favorite - other than the references to the New Orleans Hornets this book is great - Go Lakers!
5,Impressive and uniquely intriguing.,"Look out Kay Scarpetta here comes Tempe Brennan!! I picked up Reich's first novel Deja Dead at the suggestion of a librarian. I am a Patricia Cornwell fan but after three chapters of Reichs' first book I knew I wanted to pick up her second. It was impressive and uniquely intriguing as Deja Dead.It was fascinating to read about how our ""neighbors to the north"" handled their homicides.The characters were well defined and complimented the book's main character Tempe Brennan. Reichs' clinical descriptions and scientific explanations of forensics and forensic anthropology was well done!I can't wait to read her next book to find out what new challenges Tempe has facing her. Perhaps Hollywood needs to consider a movie about Tempe Brennan?"
2,Too far-fetched,"As others have pointed out, this story is mostly a succession of hair-risingly unbelievable coincidences.Let me add that it includes a rather unappetizing make-out scene - God knows why! I have absolutely nothing against a female lead having a love interest, but it seems quite obvious that the author is not only inexperienced but also uncomfortable when it comes to writing love scenes. Oh well... Romance sells, I suppose, even if it's poorly written. The only good thing about the clumsy description is that we are spared the ""insert tab A in slot B"" part.The only plausible - and hence best - part of the story was the plotline about the old bones in the church, and that took up maybe 50 pages of the book."
3,Disappointing,This is the first Kathy Reichs book that I read and I was not impressed. The story locations and plots kept changing constantly and there were many drawn out and boring areas to this book. Tempe Brennan though not an unlikable character does not provide a strong enough lead. I would probably attempt another Kathy Reichs novel but not one with Tempe Brennan.
2,"Turgid, nay, tedious","Oh dear. Another person steeped in his art/job/hobby writes a book so as to be able to brain-dump his hard-earned skill in the guise of literature on the hapless reader.This is a very poor novel. It is peppered with irritating coincidences and has long turgid passages that require teeth-gritting determination to wade through.In my opinion the heroine is unlikable and her angst fabricated in an attempt to give her some depth ... a device which to my mind fails. This is an attempt to out Cornwell Cornwell. Trouble is that Cornwell got there first and in the process exhausted the genre so that most people I know who were fans are now equally fed-up with her output.Perhaps it is a little unfair to denigrate Reichs because Cornwell's mother-lode is exhausted but even so, Reichs just don't cut it for me."
2,Half way thru reading then bang! You may as well be dead.,"I was riveted to this book and really picking up speed until I reached about dead center of the book. Then POW! Ms. Reichs throws ridiculous, implausable coincidences to salvage her complex plot. I was really in there with her until her ridiculous plot links. This a mystery that detectives must dream of. I call it the ""follow the dots"" scheme that result in a staight line honing in on a places the heroine just happens to be even if they are literally a thousand miles apart. Thus I hurled the book into the air, it fell to earth I care not where!"
2,"Sorry, Not even close to a Deja Dead.","I really enjoyed Deja Dead. Death Du Jour however seemed to be forced, frenetic, and padded. I felt there were a hundred pages in the middle that were rather experimental in style. Does the author gain some personal redemption discussing for a page why she did not spend the evening with her x-husband. Do we need all of the cliched discussion of the south and draped Spanish moss ending in probably one of the worst sentences to be published this year: ""The tide of time itself ebbs tardily to the eternal sea""? (p. 170). This is not the dialog of a forensic anthropologist.Hey, I am not a professional critic. I have never read Patricia Cornwell. I eagerly await another tale of forensic sleuthing from Kathy Reichs who I'm sure has a great story to tell. Now just tell it!"
1,"Sorry, again a clear miss","I recently reviewed Kathy Reichs' first book and thought it was bad, very bad actually. But because Kay Scarpetta's new one wasn't out yet, I read this one. Again we see our heroine Tempest going through a load of cases, connecting them and saving them. Cool. What Mrs. Reich did better this time: the case is more believable than in the first book. But still: the character is pretty flat, the relationship of the protagonists is way off the standard we came to love with Patricia Cornwell, especially Mother & Daugther. BTW: I knew before I opened the book that Tempest would get a kick over the head after leaving a something. And, yessss for three points, she did. I fought through to the end and then threw the book around the room because I hated myself for reading that far. Spare yourself this one."
1,Don't bother reading this book.,"Having greatly enjoyed ""Deja Dead,"" I really looked to Death Du Jour. Unfortunately it is a complete disappointment. I found the story overy contrived and coincidental. The characters were wooden. Frankly, the whole thing seemed like a bad movie where no one had the courage to ask ""why, this story."" In summary, don't bother with this lousy novel."
4,Enjoyable,"Reichs does a nice job of weaving this story together. It was a little slow in the beginning, but came on strong late in the book. If you like stories about forensics, you will enjoy this book."
4,Craving for a delicious book,"Welcome to the wonderful fantasy land of Ma and Pa Brindle's. This book tells a delicious and fulfilling tale of one Sweet Dream Pie and what happens when people indluge in this enormous pie. Through colorful and rich pictures and such descriptive words as: ""clouds of powdered sugar, a chocolate tornado, or a thick, sweet syrup bubbled and oozed down the sides,"" Audrey Wood allows the reader to feel as if they too are enjoying a piece of Ma Brindle's Pie. Come and allow your dreams to indulge in a piece of Sweet Dream Pie."
4,A SLEEPER HIT! (DONT PASS ON THIS ONE..),"DESPITE THE CLUTTER OF RECENT FIGHTING GAMES, FOR THE DC,THERE IS ONE IN PARTICULAR THAT STANDS OUT, AS MORE ORIGINAL. PSYCHIC FORCE IS A FUN AS WELL AS INOVATIVE KINDA GAME. THE PREMISE, IS SOMEWHAT LIKE MARVEL COMIC'S X-MEN YOU GET TO PLAY AS ONE OF THE TEN PSYCHIC ENHANCED CHARACTERS, WHO ARE HATED AND FEARED BY MANKIND, DUE TO THIER EXTRODANARY PSYCHIC ABILITIES. THE CHARACTERS, ARE FOR THE MOST PART, HOVERING HIGH ABOVE THE AIR, DUELING IT OUT USING THEIR ABILITIES,PROJECTILES, SHIELDS, AND THE USUAL PUNCH & KICK COMBOS. THE CHARACTER DESIGNS ARE MORE OF ANIME FARE, AND ALTHOUGH THE GRAPHICS ARE NOT ON A PAR WITH NAMCO'S SOUL CALIBUR, IT ADDS DEPTH WITH BRILLIANT COLORS, THE GAMEPLAY IS MUCH CHALLENGING THAN SAY, POWER STONE AND MARVEL VS. CAPCOM. I HIGHLY RECOMAND THIS FOR FANS OF JAPANAMATION AS WELL AS FIGHTING AFFICIANADOS. IN A WORD; ""brillant!"""
3,Very mediocre.,"I downloaded some awesome movies of this game in action. While it is a decent fighting game, at least as good as Street Fighter 2 for SNES, it looks more or less like it belongs there. The graphics are poor, not NEARLY as elegant as Soul Calibur. There are few attacks and fewer combos. The music is uninspiring. The premise is the only redeeming quality of this game but the storyline is so ridiculous, it's more fun to laugh at than be immersed in. Despite it's numerous flaws, it's a fun game if your SC disc is scratched and deffinitely fun multiplayer where you can laugh with friends about how silly things are. There are about fifty other games for the DC I'd buy first. Unfortunately, this was my fifth. =("
2,overstated,These batteries last approx 1 hr which is the same recording time from the originals plus these are considerably larger
4,Pleasantly surprised but with reservations,"The is the very first book that I have read by Alan Cook. The book started off slow but didn't remain that way. It was a good fun read. I had issues at certain parts. 1)Tony is a mid 30's male that sometimes is lusting after a soon to be 18 years old female. Wrong. Wrong. Wrong. Even though their relationship was platonic, her mother not knowing him pretty much allowed him to have free rein with her. 2) What appears to me to be the gratuitous reference to 911. 3) Having a character who has never spoken with, had history or experience with the ""nanny"" in this story allude to a nanny in California being a Spanish speaker. Not all nannies are Spanish speakers. Not all nannies speak Spanish. These are a few of the instances where I shook my head.Overall it's not a bad book. It was fun. I plan to read more by Alan Cook."
3,Good effort-worth it if your a Nat fan,"While not up to some of the music produced with Vincent Herring this is still and excellent bluesy outing with nice selection of not to ofetn heard tunes.Can't go wrong with Walter""Bookie"" Booker or Jimmy Cobb the pleasant surprise here is Rob Bargad a pianist not high up on radar who plays a nice funky/bluesy style al la Timmons of the Adderley's original ""Mercy,Mercy,Mercy"" writer Joe Zawinul (before he lost his way into fusion...oh well them's fightin' words fopr some and ""Can't we all just get along?"".All in all this is worth the super cheap asking price and you might even pull it out now and then.For a better Nat/Herring pairing I'd get ""Old Folks"" or ""Tribute To Cannonball"".But this is worth getting.I'd definitely give it 3.5 or maybe a 4 star if your a devotee.Chazz"
5,I am in love.,"I absolutely fell in love with both the hero and the heroine. Their story felt real, and they are both such well-rounded, fleshed out charcters. I wish this title was available on Kindle, so it would be easy to grab and reread. High praise, indeed, from someone like me who reads a book once and never wants to touch it again (there's just too much to read and not enough time in one lifetime).The book starts out with letters exchanged between an Army Ranger and a somewhat-annonymous pen-pal (she's the sister-in-law of his best friend, another officer who is deployed with him). Letters pop up sporadically in the book. This is set during the Gulf War, and it's not laden down with a lot of Army lingo or heavy war issues, but it has enough authenticity to show that the author really put time and care into her research. It was so good - I couldn't put it down. I highly recommend."
3,super spoiler,You will never guess what all this twenty thousand years fuss was about. Are you ready? Another Maginot line.I am disappointed too...
2,Not up to standards,"If you're an Asimov junkie like me, you'll buy and read this book no matter what anybody says. But if you were thrilled with the first three books in the series, ecstatic over the addition of Prelude to Foundation, and slightly less than pleased with Foundation's Edge, then you'll be disappointed with this one.I felt Isaac was preaching at me in some sort of new age galactic godspeak rather than entertaining me with a good story. Maybe that's the danger of writing so many good adventure books: eventually you want to advertise your beliefs. I don't know if that's true or not, but I do know that this book was a terrible letdown for me in an otherwise brilliant series.The ending didn't gather together the threads of the story, but only seemed to serve as a steppingstone for books that were never to be written. The Foundation Series is a grand adventure, standing up for the most part over forty years after some of the volumes were written. Well, five out of six of them do, at least."
2,A bit disappointing,"It would seem that the last batch of books produced by the Asimov aren't quite what they use to be. I'm still and always will be an avid fan, but the last two books in the foundation series were a bit of a let down. Though Foundation Forward (in the timeline between Prelude to Foundation and Foundataion) was relatively the best of his last 3.-chris"
3,Disappointing?,"The final episode in the Foundation saga in terms of internal sequence. Councilor Golan Trevise and his companions finally trace the myth of Earth to a physical planet. To his horror, Earth was a radio-active desert seeming to have no bearing on galactic affairs. Then their attention is focused on the unique satellite orbiting the burnt out hulk. There a mystery spanning millenia is revealed and a (very) old friend of Asimov's readers makes his return. Despite this, there is a definate sense that Dr A was revisiting old stomping grounds with the intention of closing off as many loopholes with as little effort as possible :-("
4,"Great ""end"" to the series....","Wow! This last book in the Foundation series definately kept me turning the pages way past my bed time. It was generally less gripping and satisfying than the original series. However since this book was written much more recently than the trilogy, Asimov's adaptation of 30+ years of scientific theories and insights is very insightful and intriquing.The ending however, is quite a disturbing one. It hints that there is indeed more to this supposed ""ending"" to the Foundation series. I cannot say anymore in fear of throwing spoilers into this review... all I can write is that it's killing me... for there seems to be more than meets the eye to the formation of Galaxia.Oh ya, very strongly recommended you read Asimov's Robot series and of course the original Foundation series and Foundation's Edge. I read Edge before the Robot novels and frankly in hindsight it would have been much more enjoyable and made more sense if I had done otherwise."
2,not one of his best...,"...and the ending really sank the series. I wish he'd have stopped with the original trilogy. Ursula LeGuin made the same mistake with the Earthsea books: three brilliant and a fourth turkey. This is the turkey, and Asimov kept fowling up after it. Bummer."
1,Hostile nonsense,"Written in the late Thirties, this book is a misguided attempt to interpret Robespierre as a precursor to Hitler and Stalin. It is a complete distortion of the aims and goals of the French revolution. Interested readers should pursue histories by Thompson, Hampson, Jordan and Rude instead to get a more accurate portrait of Robespierre"
5,"Posture, Get It Straight","I found this book to be very informative. I have also have the video from the author and find it extremely helpful. I thought I would share the info with all readers. I wrote to the author at JaniceNovak @aol.com and purchased the video through her toll-free 1-800-756-7934. I'm glad I did the reseach. The video is very easy to follow. Thanks, Janice."
4,a good simple book to understand the basic terms and concepts,a good simple book to understand the basic terms and concepts
3,disapoints,This is supposed to be one of those classic Marvel storylines. You can tell they were trying to write it that way. And it does have some interesting moments (turning Wolverine to rubber) but as a whole it isn't just that great. You get a lot of minor characters who are all powerful doing major things. It's just not that great of a story.
1,Avoid this One and save your time and money,"Eric Flint is a learned and knowledgeable historian with a splendid imagination. He has co authored a number of good alternative history books with David Drake and his 1632 was excellent. Left to his own devices, however, or with a lesser editor, he becomes lost in the twists and twirls of his own highly nuanced world. He has a difficult time sustaining realistic characters. (Pretty much the same set of heros again and again.) Here, another reviewer compared this to reading a high school newspaper, which is apt -- but more likely one will find as much benefit reading off of Flint's fan website and finding that various folks have given additional life to his characters in his alternate universe. So let's join those who hope that he will return to the main flow, with a better editor and prove himself an independent success."
1,Rip-off,"I liked Flint, I trusted him to deliver his usual good reading but now, I have been scammed to the bones by his three last spin-off's, the Galileo Affair, the Grantville Gazette, and the Ram Rebellion. Do not buy any of those awful books, you would be,like me, finding yourself in the category ' A mark is born every minute'. Those three rate a very high Minus..."
1,Pretty Disappointing,"I have to say that after becoming immersed in 1632 and enjoying 1633, I feel like the author's pretty much abandoned the project to whoever wants to publish some small snippet. This was the worst of the series by far and I actually just gave up on it half way though which I never ever do to fiction. I truly wanted to see the author embrace this universe and allow me to come along for an enjoyable ride. Looks like it's not going to happen. Probably need to hold off or write your own version since that's kind of what got published anyway."
2,Stagnent!,"I love the RoF series. I love the politics, intrigue, planing, and military actions. But this book is borderline horrible! The Ram Rebellion was fun for the first 20 to 30 pages, but then it just got old. Simply felt like bad filler in a worse dinner. How many pages about a dance instructor trying to figure out how to get a dance company up and running? It became a Seinfeld show. A book about 'nothing'. I have read maybe 1000 sci-fi/fantasy books. I can count on one hand how many I have just given up on or skipped through. This is one of them. This is the equivalent of a modern day reality show about little to nothing. Some may like that, some may love that. Good for you. I feel ripped off in time and money.I wont buy any more written by VD."
1,Awful,"I am a great fan of Eric Flint's works but this one is just plain awful. If I wanted to read fantasy, I would buy it. I just feel that by putting this book in the series, they were trying to sell something that otherwise would not sell. I would not recommend an alternate history fan buy this book!"
4,Nice Little ring,"This ring is pretty, it can go good with another ring. It narrow and the stone size is small by it self. It would be a good thumb ring. Again nice ring that does not have alot of bling."
5,it's great!,My boyfriend gave this to me for valentine's day. I love that I can get leave it on while washing my hands since it's sterling silver so it won't make my fingers green! It also looks pretty legit like something that cost way more!
5,Perfect - Just What I Wanted,"This ring was perfect for what I wanted - size was correct. Although a bit bright when it arrived, with wear it looks more and more like the real thing! Can't beat the price."
5,Loved it,My girlfriend really loved the ring and hasn't taken it off since I gave it to her for her birthday
2,Too small,I returned this item because the diamonds were too small. It wasn't a channel set and you couldn't appreciate the diamonds enough. I found a channel set band of the same size and diamonds were more visible. It was not what I expected.
2,"""Made in China"" printed on the inside","Beautiful ring, but with ""made in china"" printed quite clearly on the inside of the ring, it doesn't seem like the best kind of gift if it's supposed to mean something. Another review warned me of this tacky attribute of the ring, but I thought, ""there's no way a 2mm ring could visibly have those words printed on its interior!"" Well, I was wrong."
1,cheesy,"When I saw this ring it looked very pretty, wrong! The ring looks very cheesy, nothing like the picture! The stones are so small they are almost non existant. I could have got a nicer ring in a bubble gum machine. I just can't believe I bought this peice of crap. I'll never by another piece of jewelry, unless I see it in my hand first. I live and learn everyday. I won't waste my time sending it back, but at least I learned a lesson!"
2,Disappointed,"This was not what I expected, but for the price, I should have realized it would not look like an expensive ring. The stones were very, very small. It was returned."
2,Might not be worth it..,After about a week of wearing it one of the stones fell out. Other then that it was very pretty. But i cant wear it anymore.
3,it's ok,"It's ok, not as sparkly as I thought it would be. I'm looking for a substitute wedding ring as my fingers have swelled up since I had a baby. It was a little uncomfortable if you squeeze your fingers together. I ended up returning this one. I think I will purchase a ring in person instead of online. Haven't had much luck so far."
3,Pretty good for a B- movie,"Pretty good B movie. Full of action, adventure, a little sexy and good fun. A younger Don Johnson along with a full cast of actors you will remember from both movies and television, makes this movie fun to watch. The action scenes are well done and keep you right in the midst of the action."
2,pedifix,"Maybe for a mild case of athlete's foot. This does not work for severe or chronic tinea versicolor. The tee tree content is pretty high, but it's not enough."
3,I think its just pine oil,Not really working but seems to strip all the beneficial oils off the body and makes you drier and itchier. Can't really speak for its effectiveness since I still got skin fungus
1,Please Don't Fall for the False Reviews,"I purchased this product a year ago; looking back, however, I believe I fell victim to such great reviews... a little too great. Some posts goes from one month to the next. Others are posted a day apart with similar titles such as ""relief!"" or ""immediate relief!"" Ugh. I should have been more suspicious. Oh, and the product did nothing for my Tinea Versicolor. :("
1,smells horrible,"Bought this product to help with hives and some foot issues however this stuff smell horrible kinda like something a hospital would use I could barely use it once, as for as effectiveness nothing has changed however I only used it once."
3,I don't use it,It is probably a great product but I am too lazy to use it. So I don't really have an opinion.
2,Not as good as I was expecting,"Well after reading all these reviews I got this CD in anticipation that it was gonna be great. I was lead to believe that it was one the best cd's of this type of music so i went right out and got it. Turns out that glassjaw is not that good at all, their songs have no direction and dont make sense. I'm all for the screaming and everything but it doesnt work with them, the guitars have to be the worst thing about it, their all over the place, the singer is great and is the only thing that keeps it respectable. Some of the songs alright though, i really liked ape dos mil, and there were a few other decent ones like must have run all day, two tabs of mescaline, cavalcade and convectuoso. So overall, this cd just isnt what i thought it would be since i like bands that are supposed to be like it like the used, thrice, thursay, and other kinds of band like my chemical romance(which i really recommend)."
4,Misterious place,I have read alot of Gary Paulsen's books and he writes some good books. But Transall Saga was amazing with all of the adventurous action that took place in this book. I thought the book was a really good read because it explains in gret amount of deatail on how he survives in this new world and how he encounters new civilations and new creatures that he has to get alonge with in order to make it out. I thought this book was great and I would reacomend it to anyone.
5,not typical gary paulsen material,"This book is quite a change from all of the other Paulsen books, although it retains Paulsen's usual underlying theme of survival in the wilderness. Yup. And I'm afraid that several of the other reviewers were misguided or perhaps confused, as the book is not overflowing with ""goar""; nor was the main character-Mark-on Mars. I found this novel captivating and entertaining. I enjoyed Mark's attitude that he aquired on Transall, which is the name of the world Mark is mysteriously transported to after falling into a bizzare blue light. This book has a satisfying ending and leaves the reader both awestruck and contemplative."
5,Tim McIntyre,I feel that The Transall Saga has got to be the best book I have read in a very long time. The whole time reading this book kept me on the edge of my chair it grabbed me in thrilling ways. Some parts I feel like I am in the book but of course I am not!!!I recommend this book to any one that enjoys adventurous reading. I had a great time reading it I hope you have the same feelings as well!!!
5,Great story,"The teen hero of the book falls into a spot in the desert that takes him to another place to another place where he must learn to live off the land or die. Just when he masters some skills he is captured and made a slave by feudal tribes of beings that are similar to humans. He fights for his freedom and becomes a leader.When I was a kid, my dad introduced me on to the rollicking science fiction he had read when he was young himself. Robert Heinlen, Edgar Rice Burroughs, Andre Norton... In the same vein this is a good adventure yarn of a stranger lost in another land.The author is well known for his great teen survival stories (like Hatchet) and western adventures, has written a new teen adventure in the genre that I grew up with and miss so much. Thanks Gary, and I hope you write some more like this one."
5,This is more than a physical fitness book.,This is an excellent book. The concepts are clear and well defined. The advice here will help many gain a healthy relationship with exercise. This is a great guide to self-acceptance and emotional peace.The author describes her own odyssey with weight and body-image obsession with astonishing honesty.
1,Timmy's Special Delivery,I have the movie in vhs but wanted to purchase it on dvd for my younger grandchildren who love the vhs. The vhs is giving us trouble. When I ordered the dvd they said it was in stock and charged me for the dvd. Then I was given a refund and told they did not have it. I would really like to have this dvd for my babies. I was very disappointed. I wish you wouldn't have said you had it then said you didn't. My review for the dvd is excellent but for your company ...poor.
3,Jewellery and Silversmithing Techniques/Codina,"I recently purchased this book and two others by the same author: ""The Art and Craft of Making Jewellery"" and ""The Complete Book of Jewelry Making: A Full-Color Introduction to the Jeweler's Art"". With only very minor changes, they are essentially the exact same3 book. I think it is questionable to proffer 'triplets' as different books.The layouts and illustrations are beautiful, however."
1,Not worth the price,I expected this to be a large book like the other Good Old Days books that I bought. It is only 16 pages. I do not blame the seller. I was stupid for not checking it out before I bought it.
5,Best of the Big Screens,"Agonized for many months deciding on a rear projection TV formy house and compared just about every model available (except forHDTV models) and found the Sony KP-48V80 to be the best out there. Keep in mind that the picture quality is only as good as the incoming signal (many stores have projection TVs connected to DVD players only, be sure to view TV with other sources when comparing). True, the Sony is the most expensive analog for it's size out there but there's a reason for that. This TV can't be beat (except maybe by the XBR rear projection series). END"
5,Great Stuff!,"I have filled all my salt shakers with Redmond's Real Salt. I learned about it when I was researching the pH Miracle Diet. Dr. Young taught me how important natural sea salt is to the body. I've heard others say that sea salt tastes better than refined salt, but my taste buds aren't that discerning. I just know that Real Salt is healthier than table salt and I can't tell the difference in taste."
1,"Sedaka's ""Greatest Hits"" a bust","With the exception of 3 songs, this ""greatest hits"" is a misnomer. The majority of his songs I can't believe were ever actual hits. Basically an unlistenable record."
5,Basis - the best makeup remover!,"I have used Basis gel for years... not only as a face wash, but as a shower gel and even a shampoo when I am traveling the world. I have skin sensitivities and find that if I use something other than Basis, I get itchy. Basis removes eye makeup beautifully - even waterproof masquera.One note: If you buy in bulk, refridgerate the tubes you are not using, as the product can go bad after a time in warm climates."
2,"Very drying, made my skin break out","I was looking for a regimen change. Why? I'm not sure, except that I thought there might be something even better than the Purpose Gentle Cleansing Wash I've been using for years. I bought the four-pack of Basis based on the high ratings from other users. At first it was okay, though I found the smell overpowering, but soon my skin became noticeably worse. After a couple of weeks, I had to quit. My skin was drier than before and I had gone from few and rare pimples to all-the-time breakouts. I'm disappointed. Should have stuck with the Purpose."
1,Wrng item,"I was unable to use product because apparently the adaptor did not fit my laptop, even though I had the right spec. Shipping was expensive so i did nt return product."
3,strange ways,If the underworld and the criminal mind interests you then read it. Strangeways is a hard time prison in England. Moll reads like something from there. It reminded me a bit of Genet's autoboigraphy as a homosexual and pick pocket. Yick. Moll is obviously a cover for Defoe's tentative homosexuality. Its not well suppressed like in Robinson Crusoe with his wonder Man Friday. It gets to be obvious and in the way like a sore thumb especially when you read these books together. Yuck. But there are those remarkable insights.
3,moll flanders,could not get into the book at all when i read or listen to a book if it dose not grab me stright away thats the end i can not read it
2,Old Classic Good Audio,"Well, its a classic so if you like classics, this is one. I got it for a car ride and to try out the audio feature of the Fire. That is wonderful and I will use Audio Books again,"
1,Disappointing.Very!,"I expected a lot from this book.I was very disappointed.And to think I read it to the last letter.Sure,it speaks about about the fate of a woman in the 18th cenetury,a very rare thing in those times,because nobody cared about poor women or independent women(a ridiculous notion then)or ""bad"" women and why they became bad.But,it is not good literature.Almost half of it is an inventory of the things she (Mall)stole,robbed,cheated ... If it were a 150 pages shorter,it would have been a much better book.Save your time and energy for a much better book,and there are many of those!"
4,Historical Fiction,Wonderfully compelling. I couldn't put it down! I am so glad I decided to read this book and I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys historical fiction.
1,Don't bother - the writing is terrible.,"Poorly constructed sentences, fuzzy descriptions, inappropriate tone, self-serving references, opinion mixed with ""fact"" - this book has it all. The book is an embarassment."
3,Say What?,"I rarely quit reading a book until I'm finished, and this one was close, but I stuck with it and I'm glad I did. I admit, I skimmed a few pages dealing with the formulas and math, but the chapters that I did understand gave me a greater appreciation for the universe that I live in...currently:)"
3,"Interesting, but hand-waving and vague.","The concepts that underline this book are very interesting, and quite a lot has been written on them in the popular and not-so-popular press. Michio Kaku aims his book squarely at the 'popular science' market. There is no maths in the book, and not an awful lot of physics either. It is a book written to fascinate, and as such it does well, but in my opinion it does not delve deeply enough for the discerning reader. For instance, we don't even get a glance of the maths behind Kaku's ideas. What is really needed in this area is a book called something like 'Elementary String Theory', or 'Strings for the Mediocre Physicist'. This would allow students and other interested parties to have a look at the maths (which I am assured is not too bad) and the deeper concepts (derived from classical mechanics) that lie behind this fascinating area of Physics."
4,An effective and truly genius approach!,"Michio Kaku does an excellent job of mixing a touch of history and introductory ideas with detailed and concrete physics information. Packed with a sort of ""timeline"" approach to the changing world of physics, from the ""mainstream"" ideas of Einstein, Newton and Maxwell to newer ideas such as string theory and the multiverse. An excellent addition to any physics library, this book will broaden your physics vocabulary and knowledge of physics history ; including its influences on society and the art world alike. Sure to open up new dimensions of thought in an easy-to-understand format."
2,Godinger Silver Pineapple Crystal Gravy Boat,"This gravy bowl is pictured with a ladel. The reason I chose this item is because it came with a ladel. But, guess what, the picture is false advertising because it does not contain a ladel. Huge disappointment! Why not just show a picture of the bowl without the ladel???"
5,A Very Readable Book,I had taught college physics for 15 years and did some laser research. I will recommend this good book to math and physics students.
3,Could be easier..,"Poser Figure Artist has many features that make it ideal for artists, including but not limited to realistic light and shadows and the ability to pose every part of the body, even the finger tips. It should, however, be easier to learn how to pose and move the figure. This is one program that I could not work/ manipulate without the manual, located as a PDF on the CD."
3,"A neat ""toy,"" but still needs a bit more to be truly useful!","These were on sale a while back, so I bought a pair.Since they include GMRS, I made the stupid assumption that they also had sub channels... wrong!Also, the VOX feature (voice activated transmit)... takes about 5 or 6 seconds to actually engage. This boils down to the fact that you need to start making noise 5 or 6 seconds before you say anything that will be heard on the other end.The sport club that I belong to, makes heavy use of the sub channels (there are so many people using FRS type radios now... you REALLY shouldn't bother buying anything that doesn't have sub channels).From the reviews I've read, these guys have come a LONG way from their early models. However, without the sub channels, and with such a delay in the VOX feature... it's a neat ""toy,"" but they still have a bit more to go before they become truly useful.-D"
5,EXCELLENT COWBOY BALLADS,Marty has a wonderful voice and these western songs bring back memories of singing along with him many years ago....This collection is well worth the purchase price....Highly recommend you give it a try ! !
2,Review of Marty Robbins Gunfighter Ballads and trail Songs,"This is a classic recording of Marty Robbins. Unfortunately, the copy that was sent to me does not play properly, with many skips and pauses on almost all of the tracks. I would return it if your company policy allowed it."
4,Gunfighter Ballads & Trail Songs,Brings back memories of 59-60 when I first listened to Marty Robbins. I lived in El Paso when that one hit the charts.
4,Captivating,"I really loved this book. I was captivated by the story of the Danish Resistance and how the whole country worked together to save the Jews. I have already started reading websites and searching for other books to learn more about this subject. I thought the author described the Danish characters and stories just beautifully. The other story line (Sidney and her mother) was a bit weaker, but still enjoyable. I was pulled into the world the author created in Maine, but I just didn't like Sidney very much. I suppose we weren't really supposed to, as over time she seemed to become more and more like her domineering mother. Overall, a really special book that I just couldn't stop reading."
1,The Last of The Belles,"This isn't worth buying, the copy of the movie is horrible, a complete waste of money!!! I looked forward seeing it again, but it is very bad copy of a pretty good movie."
2,Not what I thought...,"I bought this book seeking some insight into my own desire to escape to the Southern Utah region several times a year. Instead of a wise and intelligent 'father' of modern envirolmentalism... I found Abbey to be a hypocrit. He throws trash into the desert, thinks himself above the law, and disturbs fragile ecosystems as much or more than the people he rants on and on and on and on about. Disappointing."
2,Too wordy,"Author just drifted on and on and on about observations that seemed more focused on showing his percieved intellectual superiority than substance. Reminds me of a sermon from church where the speaker sees how many words he can apply to the concept of sin, dragging the message on and on and on to add time but very, very little substance."
3,Personality vs. Subject Matter,"I began this piece with high expectations being a fan of desert exploration. My review for this product would be quite mixed. When Abbey is dealing with the environment itself, the book's a winner. When he is giving his very strong views on all other aspects of life it is very tedious...and I agree with his points. I just felt I was being bludgeoned with them. I'd recommend the book only with this caveat."
4,Interesting Little Crime Novel / British Courtroom Drama,"This book is sometimes listed with the subtitle: ""The Strange Trial of Arthur Groome"". It is an appropriate subtitle as the vast majority of the text focuses on the trial of the accused.The crime concerned is the brutal slashing-dismemberment murder of a Soho (London) prostitute. The man accused is a respectable professional with a wife and family: Arthur Groome.The trial proceeds and winds its way through the British courts circa 1947. I found it a real ""page-turner"" with the climax being the verdict. The author, Edgar Lustgarten, carefully balances the prosecution and the defense and the final verdict is very much in question until the end. It is an easy read with rich character description: ""She was fatter than ever, and the bags under her eyes hung like some horrible decaying fruit."" An interesting little book if you're interested in crime novels or British courtroom drama."
1,Garbage,"This has to be the biggest waste of money for the dumbest concept of a plant feeder. My main complaint is that the thing doesn't even have an intake tube/straw to pull fertilizer into the feeder nozzle. The tank also does not fill completely. This means that you have to turn it upside down or sideways to get any fertilizer out. Next, the sprayers are horrible. My previous sprayer had a vertical fan making it easier to sweep inclined plants from left to right. It's not a big deal, because I have to keep this thing sideways to use it anyway (which means I can use the horizontal fan) haha. I also got better range on my previous sprayer. That could be partly because of the poorly designed nozzles on this sprayer, or the fact that the cheap plastic parts sometimes leak, relieving what little pressure I apply to it. I guess it's back to the old sprayer..."
1,I'm vindicated!,"I didn't buy this from Amazon. I bought it locally. Having used it, I thought I'd check in on Amazon just to see if anyone else had the same problems. Good grief! I wish I had read the Amazon reviews first! If the growth of the plants has anything to do with the randomness of the blue spray, every other plant will be gigantic and the others will starve. I even did the upside-down, shake, off-and-on routine that others did (funny we all tried the same things), but nothing helped.I do love the product Miracle Grow, but I don't understand how they could get the sprayer so wrong.I also got spray all over myself. I wonder if I'll get taller. Or maybe just one side of me will get taller.Anyway, I'll be looking for a good sprayer as I have a great big box of Miracle Grow to use up."
5,Lost Lynch Shows on DVD!!!!!!!!!!!!,"For anyone interested in this or David's other short lived show called ON THE AIR, you can find them on DVD at WWW.REVOK.COM. Enjoy! I hope I helped someone out!"
3,Lynch in Obscurity,"Originally an HBO production with three unseemingly related stories that all take place in the same Hotel Room. I would not reccomend this film to just anyone, but to die-hard David Lynch fans, they might eat this up. As much as I love Lynch's work, this one was tough to swallow. Although the stories themselves were intriguing, I cant say they went beyond that, nor did I see any connection between them. This film remains a strange one without the mystery and suspense of classic Lynch film."
3,"Slower than stock ""power prop""","Fits my Endura C2 30. Is bigger than the stock ""power prop"" but has a lower pitch on the blade. On my boat, it is slower."
4,Woke Up This Morning,"For those of you that REALLY know how to dance... this is a good, slow, sexy Samba"
3,I got what I paid for,"Quality of construction is fine for the price. Biggest problem is that the handle is short, making it tough to brush/scrape a hot grill without burning yourself."
2,Pure Dissappointment,"I am sorry but this album was not what I was hoping it would be. I purchased it as a child and own it now as an adult. However, the only reason I do own it was because they attached their videos on DVD. We like it (Wild & Loose) and Juicy Gothca Krazy are great songs but only in there video forms. If you are looking for those sames songs as released on video on CD you aren't going to find it. Sad to say but I feel the only reason this album really sold was because many saw the videos first and then purchased the album hoping to hear the same thing."
4,Okay series,"The fifth season was okay. Not as good and the first four seasons. Too much about sex and girls. The earlier seasons were much funnier. Still good though, you can't help but like Will Smith. The whole cast is still funny."
2,"Heidi, starring Shirley Temple","I rented this 88 min. long DVD. Very disappointed that it did not tell the same story I remember seeing as a child. It seems that Paramount has cut the original so that much of the character building scenes are no longer present. That is what really made the story of Heidi have an impact. If I had never seen it before I would be sorely disappointed in the story. As it is now, I am only disappointed in what has been done to the movie. If anyone knows of a full length version that is available, I am there! Could it be the one referred to by your other reviewer (Jake Marsico) that Fox has done?"
3,"Charming, but not ""Heidi""","The story was changed too much! Most people are just Shirley Temple fans who don't care about the story, or the level she is forced to preform at, for that matter. The role of Heidi was not well witten and,if it is by my understanding Shirley Temple is an intellagent girl, could have preformed the role as it was in the novel. The climax might be too scary for some small children, and did not not make any sense! If Heidi is near to your heart, i would advise you to only watch this once. I did like being able to share Christmas with Heidi and the Seasamons though."
2,It's Okay....,I didn't see anything totally special or touching about this movie. The Alps don't even look that pretty. If you want to see the best Heidi I suggest watching the 1993 version of it.
1,Horrible Movie!,"As someone who loves the story Johanna Spyri created, this version of Heidi is the worst production of the story I have ever watched. Number one, it does not follow the wonderful written tale that Spyri penned. Two, the painted scenery is a real mockery of the beautiful Alps in Switzerland and three the acting is very affected, even by Miss Temple. If you want a true authentic version of this story, order the Disney DVD starring Jason Robards as the Grandfather, Patricia Neal as Peter's Grandmother, Jane Seymour as Fraulein Rottenmeyer and of course Noley Thornton who gives an outstanding performance as Heidi."
3,One of my two favorites.,"This movie is hard to follow if you've read the book, may be even if you haven't. Still a pretty good movie, now more famous for its place in NFL football lore. Funny thing was that I had come in to get ready to watch the movie and my dad, had the game on. I came in early enough to have gotten sucked into the drama of the game. I can't tell you how nuts my dad got when they switched to the movie. You just had to be there.I liked this movie as a kid, but my kids don't seem to care for it?. I have young sons and daughters and they just don't care for Shirley Temple movies. I view them a a glimse of an era long gone."
1,HELP,"this does not work please help, reads on the computer not in the dvd player help!!! kids very unhappy please help"
5,awesome! rec'd it in a week...and it looked great! long ho! the classics..,i chose the 5star rating because the dvd looked awesome..couldnt even tell the movie was that old...i like the reformatting from the original theater showing...loved it because its a christmas classic for me for i used to watch this movie when i was younger..now its hard to find it on tv and some retail stores...would recommend this movie to anyone...glad u guys have all her classics. i will order more in the future....also it was my first time ordering from amazon and i got the dvd in a week..what a surprise?
4,Great Book! Mr. Hammond's Techniques have helped us.,"Recently my wife discovered negative entries in her credit report. She sent letters and documentation, but it was of no help. The entries remained. I bought Mr. Hammond's guide as a last resort. I followed his advice, and to our surprise, my wife's negative entries have been deleted. Mr. Hammond's techniques have cleared the way for us to get our first home."
4,Great price and a great program!,No complaints. Wish I did not have to add these other words to close this screen. Interesting process but not very thought out!
1,"Dude, what's the point?","This could possibly be the worst movie ever made. I like a dumb comedy just like the next guy. But this movie is just plain STUPID!! The acting is awful, and the plot is ridiculously dumb. It would be easier to give me the twenty bucks that you would spend on this movie, and have me punch you in your stomach. Trust me, it would be less painful."
4,Not just for teens,"This movie had me and my boyfriend laughing out loud at times. Definitely worth watching! If you're looking for slap stick comedy and a good laugh, see this! The only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is because the ending wasn't as hilarious as the rest of the movie."
2,Dude whens it over,This movie starts out funny but towards the movie the storyline gets pretty old. Its definitaly not a classic or a good movie. And its super boring and not funny. My favorite part was when it was over.
5,"Dude, Sweet!!","In one word this movie is Sweeeeeeet. All these other people give it one star and say it wasn't worth it. Well the first time I heard of it I thought it seemed stupid, but when my friend and I watched it I changed my mind. In this movie Jesse (Ashton Kutcher) and Chester (Seann William Scott) encounter ostriches, space babes, gay nordec dudes, and bubble wrap wearing space nerds. They all want the Continuim Transfunctioner. Dude Where's my Car? is worth your money so buy it!!"
1,A Waste,"Rented this out after watching many other movies of the same genre. It turned out to be stupid, but almost unwatchable after the first 1/2 hr. Was expecting much more then this."
2,I asked for this,"I asked for this. I knew what the movie was about. I knew it was going to be stupid. It lived up to its expectations. The movie is basically about two guys who don't know where their car is and end up dealing with a bunch of groups (the tech group, the jock group, the ""hot chicks"" group and two random guys) who want to take over the world. I knew I shouldn't have watched this movie, but I did. And now that I've seen it, the next time I hear about a good movie not being financed by Hollywood, I'll think, ""If this can be financed, ANYTHING should be."" People got a kick out of the ""and then"" but I thought that made the movie even goofier. And this is coming from someone who would watch every episode of ""Beavis and Butthead."" This movie made that cartoon look mildly smart."
1,Torture,"There is a certain amount of charm that is usually associated with dumb comedies. Sure, they don't exactly rack your brain, but they're a fun way to pass an hour and a half. Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure is one that springs to mind. It wasn't Citizen Kane, but it put a smile on your face, and maybe even made you laugh. Dude, Where's My Car? on the other hand lacks any amount of charm or humour. Not once did I laugh or find any of the protagonist's antics amusing. Their stupidity wasn't charming, it was absolutely mind-numbing. Besides, in what kind of a movie do the two main characters claim to be ""stoners"", but neither of them actually smoke any? The answer is a bad one. In fact, it was absolute torture to sit through this movie. After about five minutes I wished it was over. Unfortunately I saw it in the theater so I felt obligated to sit through the entire thing. If you have yet to see this movie don't waste your time."
1,Not a very good movie,I am thoroughly disappointed with this flick. I thought I was renting a movie that would have me laughing. Instead I was treated to whole lot of mind numbingly stupid banter between two guys whose names I cannot remember and will not remember because their sum of charisma and acting ability are so incredibly lacking.Go see Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure. See Fast Times at Ridgemont High (which this movie tries to emulate). But don't buy or rent this flick. You will be sorry if you do.
2,"Dude, Where's My Car?","Fox has provided Dude, Where's My Car? with a great DVD package that consists of excellent picture and sound quality, along with a handful of cool extras that are sure to please fans. For those who have never seen the film, I recommend a rental if you're a fan of ""stupid"" comedies, as it is a fairly funny and entertaining flick. 2 stars."
3,What the heck is a transfunctioner?,"3 of 5 stars for this funny but dumb sort-of sci-fi movie. This movie combines Ashton Kutcher with Seann William Scott (American Pie fame) in the lead roles as ""stoners"" who forgot what happened last night. On their journey to discover the past, they find an interesing trail of money, women, aliens and other strange people/characters. Let's not forget that Jennifer Garner appears in the movie as a girlfriend. We specially liked the 5 alien women in the black jumpsuits. A wild, funny, odd and interesting movie. I do recommend this one! Oh, what the heck is a transfunctioner?"
1,DUDE PLEASE,"First off I want to say I can enjoy crude, mindless comedy as well as the next person but this movie is just too plain dumb, whether intentionally or not to enjoy. I chuckled a few times but was really very annoyed by the repetition in a lot of the scenes (""And Then"", Dude what's my tatto say?) Ironically I rented this because my 14 year old daughter wanted to see it and she didn't last through the movie because even she said it was too stupid. This movies target audience is 8 to 14 year old boys who probably get a big kick out of such stupidity. Unless you are in that category, skip this."
4,"Very funny, very cute..Ashton and Sean..",My favorite part was when they realized they had tattoos. Other cute and funny parts.
1,Anti-comedy Matter,"By the grace of God, this film is truly terrible...Not only is it devoid of any funny material (who gives these people jobs?) but it also rips off superior films such as Bill and Ted, Wayne's World. Dumb and Dumber is stupid and goofy, but at least it is funny.Some people may find this hilarious...along with genocide, disease and Freddy Got Fingered."
2,"Dude, Where is the Comedy?","I am not sure why I went to see this. Dude, where is my mind?? Most likely I wanted to get away from it all, which is not much: for me it is mostly work these days. But this movie is either not funny at all, or funny only when you are very young and are not in the habit of thinking too much. The movie makes no sense, but neither is it absurd. I do not know what it is. Probably another flop."
1,"Dude, Where's My Refund?","In the glorious tradition of ""Freddy Got Fingered"" comes another mind-numbingly dumb attempt to make a movie that is ""so stupid, it's brilliant"". This one has Ashton Kutcher and Sean William Scott doing the ""Keenan & Kel"" routine with the word ""Dude"" thrown in as much as possible for good measure. If you couldn't figure it out from the title, the plot centers around the two moronic leads trying to track down their missing car. The fact that this cliche-driven mess and its non-existent script got greenlit in Hollywood tells you that perhaps the crack epidemic in the movie industry is worse than we thought. By the way, Jennifer Garner shows up for a small role as one of the bonehead's girlfriends. For shame."
4,Track of the Grizzly,"A very readable, enjoyable book. It was published in 1979 so I'm sure there's more and newer information on the bears, but this is a great starting place. It's author (and his brother) are famous for their early grizzly studies."
2,"Should not be called Spaghetti ""Western"" - Misleading","I grew up watching the various Trinity movies and was so excited when I saw This DVD set for sale. Turns out that there are only 2 westerns out of the 10 movies on the DVD. It may not be a big deal if you are a huge Bud Spencer and Terence Hill fan but to market this as a ""Spaghetti Western Bible"" and having the guys in their traditional western garb on the cover, gives you the idea that this is a DVD set of westerns when it's not. I was very disappointed to only see two obscure westerns versus getting a nice collection of Trinity movies."
2,Civil War Collectors Encyclopedia,Nice vintage book but somewhat out dated. Also way overpriced. Check ebay before you buy one on Amazon.
1,No big whup,"After buying it as a gift for a retired judge and law professor, I took a gander. Frankly, it's nothing you probably didn't already know, as if the title doesn't say it all. What you didn't know hits on the same old bad media cliche, just older.My friend's response was that it was a mind dulling read. Might be a good choice for someone who wants to be immersed in the currently popular I hate the press pool, but I certainly didn't get the response I had expected from one of the best read men I know."
3,Very Interesting... But Very Dry,"Really interesting topic and history, but very dry. Great for journalists, and those who are interesting in see how far (or not so far) American journalism has progressed since it's earliest days."
3,"Hyper-fashionable, and full of ideas","Named after London's most fashionable restaraunt of the moment, this book is big on fusing European and Asian cuisine. Taken at face value, the recipes are occassionally breathtaking (smoking salmon in tea), but usually just mildly novel. What is good is that new twists are put into well worn dishes(mustard in mashed potato), and it is this that sets the imagination swirling to make your own variant dishes. However, be warned, the ingredients list can be daunting; unless you live in a multi-cultural nirvana you haven't a chance of getting it all (Japanese sauces, chorizo, even kangaroo tail!). On the other hand - you can put the book on a prominent place on your bookshelf and look oh so devastatingly fashionable, sophisticated, and in the know!"
2,"Book concentrates on show dogs, rather than working Kelpies","While Mr Sloan shows some nice examples of show kelpies (which are an offshoot of the actual working strain) he neglects the real reason these dogs were developed as a breed. Working Kelpies are the work force in Australia's pastoral farming system and should be given their due. By concentrating on the shorter-legged, heavier-coated and basically non-working show dogs, Mr Sloane has doen the forefathers of the Kelpie breed a serious disservice. Having stated all that, the book does contain some fine photographs of show dogs, which , if one likes such dogs, one might find useful."
3,The Cowboy State,"This volume is part of the bicentennial States and the Nation series, which produced one book for each of the 50 states. It covers the state from 4 angles: as a major byway (but no stopping place) during trail days; as the first state to grant women suffrage; as the Cowboy state; and as an energy producing state. Interesting as far as it goes, but it's pretty much just a cursory overview. There are better books about Wyoming; Larson himself has written some of them."
3,was ok,"First book was better. Hoped for the story to advance from the first. Just circled around and led me to the third, which i probably won't read."
2,Not First Printing,"I bought this book thinking it was an adition to the autumn book line, it says first printing. I guess i need to pay closer attention because it is a reprint of the first book by a new publisher. Ripped off. I will not buy anything by this publisher again."
3,Kindle Pricing?,"Not a review (hence my average rating), but a question about the pricing of the Kindle version of this title and the one following it.Autumn: $12.48 (paperback $11.19)Autumn: The City: $41.64 (paperback $6)Autumn: Purification: $31.22 (paperback $10.19)If it wasn't for this bizarre pricing structure I would have already purchased the Kindle versions of The City and Purification after enjoying Autumn."
3,"Good, but there are better out there.","These brave pilots who flew unarmed and vulnerable in fabric covered planes deserve more recognition than they have gotten. This is a good book, just not a GREAT book. For the price, it's a good value, but try to get a copy of Dutch Schultz's 'Janey' or Don Moore's 'Low and Slow' first."
4,A good companion book!,"This book is a good companion to ""Janey, a Little Airplane in a Big War"" by Dutch Shultz."
2,I am now avoiding Moen faucets!,"We had a Moen kitchen faucet with a ""lifetime warranty."" It is junk. It started dripping after 5 years, and the exterior actually started rusting.When I tried to replace the cartridge, the screw was so cheap the head partly disintigrated and required an extractor. I could go on...Don't be fooled into thinking you are getting quality when they advertise ""lifetime warranty.""In fairness, they sent a new cartridge, but what I want is quality in the first place.It will last a lifetime --as long as you don't live more than five years!"
3,Bloco de notas,Pensei que era um livro e é um bloco de notas. Serve pra fazer portfolio de desenhista.
1,Broke in the first 3 minutes of play!,"This item is really cute. The concept is great. The kids were really excited to play with it, but within the first 3 minutes of play, it was broken and went in the trash. What a waste of money!"
4,For Eclectic Tastes Only,"If you have narrow, picky taste in music, I suggest you pass on this album.In the decade of massive sampling, Moby takes it to a different level by sampling music that takes its roots in blues, gospel, jazz, and some world music. It's as if this guy took a trip from the 40's/50's and brought his favorite samples with him to add to 90's beats.I was intrigued like most people at the various honors this CD received such as ""Top 10 Albums of the 90's."" Don't get that confused with the Top 10 Most POPULAR Albums... It is not something you will hear on the radio quite often.He's not like Fatboy Slim if some of you are wondering. It's not incredibly fast beats, large bass, and huge sound effects (except Body Rock.) I was expecting all that but after listening to this album, I would say ""Play"" is more like Beck with a bluesy 40s/50s vibe.If all that interests you, I highly recommend. If not, you will definitely not think it's the greatest album of the 90s."
2,Eclectic mix keeps you on your feet,"With Play, Moby has demonstrated in spades his musical talents by taking multiple influences and mixing them into a single album. I love the ""idea"" of what he was going for, but the product seems lacking. For some, this will be far from true. Each song is well constructed, with a good rythym that makes you want to ""play"", but the cacophany of ambient style music back to back with ""techno-rap"" doesn't work for me. Give me an album of rap or an album of ambient and I'll pick and choose; but together it feels like I've put Vivaldi and the Beastie Boys in my player and hit the shuffle button."
5,"relaxing, entertaining listening","This is no hardcore techo album, but has many great tracks. Thorougly recommended for those wishing to experiment!"
5,Heart-Warming Masterpiece...,Heart-Warming Masterpiece...It takes some time to get used to...but this one grows on you....
1,MobySignalsTheEndOfAllLifeOnEarth,"This review will never see the light of day, nonetheless it must be written so that hopefully it will have a negative effect on the 4 1/2 star rating Moby's album currently has. Sadly the world is ripe for the likes of Moby. Millions upon millions of mindless, musically impaired twits, who think that DJs like Moby are actually musicians, sing (out of key) the praises of this modern adaptation of The Emperors New Clothes.His album, Play, is a testament to the depths of human suffering. Surely no man could have more accurately put to disc the sea of emotions present on Play. From boredom to depression, rage (at his inability to create new music) to madness, Moby knows pain like no other man in history.That said, Mobys ""album"" is horrible excrement that epitomizes everything that's wrong with music today. On the other hand if you enjoy repetitious samples and funky drum beats and have an inability to whistle in tune, then Play is right up your alley."
3,Time moves on....,"I bought this CD when it was released in 1999. Back then, it seemed very avante garde. I thought I'd revisit it more than ten years on.The fact is, it hasn't worn very well. What seemed new and innovative then seems rather old fashioned now. The sounds have been overtaken by better produced, more technologically interesting creations and the revival of melody has left these non-melodic pieces behind. It's not unpleasant, just repetitious and soporific.Moby, like so many others, was a fad. Briefly popular as the latest thing, ultimately the material didn't have the staying power to be more than a passing success. Buy it for nostalgic purposes, if that's a time you look back on fondly."
1,Disappointed...,"As my title suggests, I was a bit disappointed with ""Play."" Before I listened to it, I had heard so much about Moby and was expecting a treat.The one song that really delivered was ""South Side."" Simply put, it sounds great. It is catchy and upbeat and has great music. I loved this song. But the rest of the album isn't as skillfully made.Songs like ""Run On"", ""Honey"", ""Bodyrock"", and ""Natural Blues"" COULD have been great, but are weighed down by excessive repetition. Eventually, it gets to be too much, and I don't even listen to those songs. Listen to the 30 second samples of those songs...and you have it all.And then, to top it off, there are those songs that are just completely horrible. I'm not sure if ""Down Slow"" or ""Inside"" can even be called songs. They don't really seem to have any sort of structure, just a few minutes of drum machine beats and wavering background music. They are just no fun at all to listen to.Get ""South Side"" off of iTunes and leave it at that."
1,Waste Of Money.,"The only half decent song on this CD is ""South Side,"" and probably the only reason that song is half decent is because Gwen Stefani sings most of it. The other songs are just plain horrible. No excitement, no nothing. Listen to more than two minutes of this and expect to be asleep. Moby can't even sing. This CD is pure trash. I'm sorry I ever bought it."
2,"Certainly does not belong in the ""techno"" section","I do not understand why Moby's music is always placed in the ""techno"" section. For those of you looking for some high energy, up-beat electronic music, this is not the CD to buy. Upon first listening to Play, I was shocked. The whole CD is incredibly bland. Most of the music has very little keyboards in it at all. Play belongs more in the R&B or even Easy Listening category than anywhere else. In addition to the mellow music, the samples thrown in everywhere are repetitive and annoying at times. If you are in the mood for something slower and different though...you may want to give Play a listen. There are a few tracks that are OK if you like Ambient/Contemporary music, but it's still not enough to warrant a purchase in my opinion."
3,"Great music, but low quality recording!","Moby's 'Play' CD is a real treat - loads of great tracks. However, the quality of the recording is among the worst I've ever heard. The recording quality is so bad that I can only listen to the CD in my car - it's off limits to my high-end stereo set-up. 'Porcelain', one of the best tracks on the CD is a case in point - great music but the background noise/hiss is so prevelant that I wonder whether it was introduced onto the track on purpose for some warped reason. Music rating - 5stars, but the quality is the worst of all my 200 CDs, and so I must call attention to this dramatic flaw - overall rating 3stars (Moby, do yourself and everyone else a favor and get another recording company!!)"
5,Moby creates a lush and beautiful musical landscape,"Wow. ""Play"" is one of those albums which begins to creep in quietly and slowly gets under the listener's skin and into their head. After listening to the album once through, you can't help but start back at the beginning and cycle through the tracks again and again. And again. Re-""Play"" value is through the roof on this album; the music in ""Play"" is so rich and complex, you can hear new aspects of each track after listening dozens of times. Conversely, the premise of the album is deceptively simple. Moby takes his famed beats and runs archived vocals of blues musicians over them. The result is astounding. ""Play"" is one of the best albums released in years. For an album featuring decades-old vocals, it is unbelievably refreshing and invigorating."
5,Don't leave home without Moby!,"I have taken the unusual (for me) step of buying two copies...one for my car and one for work. Moby is a genius, and the music is inspirational. Definitely on my Top 5 for 1999!"
2,New Age Muzak takes a (Hip) Hop,"Why isn't this guy on the Wyndham Hill label? Lightweight music and, in the liner notes, lightweight musings. Not necessarily bad, but I don't own an elevator."
5,Whoo LORD have mercy now!,"Okay I love this cd! I even like the first 2 tracks. In fact, ""Find my baby"" is one of my favorites. This album is so eclectic. There are so many different types of music on this one cd that there is something for everyone. This is a must have in my opinion!"
5,The best modern music I've ever heard,"I bought this CD for the song ""My Weakness"" which I first heard in an episode of the X-Files. After listening to ""My Weakness"" a few times I listened to the rest of the CD. I loved just about every song. My favorites are ""Porcelain"", ""South Side"", ""Natural Blues"", ""Run On"" and of course ""My Weakness"". Moby's music is different from most music I hear but it is definately better. The song ""The Sky Is broken"" is poetry set to music. I liked ""Run On"" for setting old singing to newer music. This one of my favorite CD's."
1,Huh?,I want to know what drugs the people who are giving rave reviews are on.I have listened to just about all of Moby's songs and the only one I liked was Porcelain.The rest were boring at best.Talk about a one hit wonder!
2,"""Everloving"" is a rip off of The Cure's ""Apart""","Hello Readers-Now I know why I was hypnotized by the sound of Moby's ""Everloving"". If you're a Cure devotee like me, you'll notice that if you sing ""Apart"" to the beat of ""Everloving"" it fits perfectly. Now I don't know if Moby had ""Apart"" in mind when he composed ""Everloving"", but it sure sounds like it. Either way it's a great instrumental w/ a tinge of new wave/gothic-just like The Cure!"
2,The Most Overrated Album Of 1999,"Upon getting this album I was incredibly exited because of all the good hype that I had heard. However little did I know that I was in for a horrible disappointment. This album is terrible. The only reason that people rave about it so much in my opinion is that they think that it is ""new"" and ""fresh,"" when infact it was a poorly made album by a poor artist. Moby takes old southern gospel tracks and tries to turn them into some sort of ""original techno."" Instead all he has done is take a bunch of dated songs that aren't very good to begin with and do what he does best, make them sound worse. Every Moby album that I have ever heard has been painful to my ears and Play seems to keep the tradition alive."
2,Moby's Repetitive Hand Gesture,"The only track worthy of praise (and 2 stars) on this album is the ephemeral ""Porcelain."" Everything else is just remixed computer-samples spun a few hundred times too many. Put some old gospel and blues songs in a Roland washing machine and this is what you get.B o r i n g . . .You'd think someone with only one name would be more interesting. ""Play"" is an example of what happens when you sign with the big money record producers. Pop goes the weasel..."
2,OttLite L139AB Task Lamp with Swivel Base in Black,"The two stars are for prompt delivery and the brightness of the light respectively. Maybe I have a faulty item, it is really annoying that the lamp does not switch on quickly and smoothly each time I switched it on. The light just does not light up, not only *after* I pull out the bulb, put it back again, and witch on several times. Apart from that, the light is conducive for reading, writing and computer work; not glaring at all."
5,For Die Hard Floyd Fans.,"This DVD is a trip back in time.Very enjoyable,but short of it.Anyway it is a great collectable for your dvd library,buy it and see for yourself."
5,"Story will make you angry, happy, sad....","This story is told in a circular fashion. It starts with 78-year-old Emma Harte as a rich and powerful woman, who has called a meeting of all her family members, then it reverts to teen-aged Emma until she is finally the woman she was at the book's beginning. This MO made the first section vague and somewhat incomprehensible but everything fell into place eventually.The plot was excellent. The horrors of war were vividly described as was the treatment of Jews and attitudes towards illegitimate children. Emma appeared to be very vindictive - totally bent on revenge but in the end she softened. The characters were so well done that at times one felt like slapping Edwina or punching out Gerald.This story will make you angry, at times happy and other times reduced to tears. A terrific read."
5,It's a great toy!,My 6 month old loves this toy! He looks so cute driving too. We connect it to his high chair and he entertains himself for quite a while.
4,A hw website saw that this is identical to a higher rated ocz model,"Great power supply with great efficiency. With my kill-a-watt meter, the power factor never seems to go below .98 which means it really is doing its job! The fan speeds up when it detects heat, and even then it is pretty quiet. I also like that it has 4 dedicated 12v rails that put out 18 amps each!My only gripe is that both of the PCI-E connectors are fed from the same 12v rail, limiting the sum of both to 18 amps."
5,Electrifying!,"This cd should bring The Tommy Castro Band all the recognition they deserve. This band is the future of Blues. My personal favorites are ""Like an angel"", ""Chairman of the board"" and ""Just a Man"". Tommys crisp guitar and vocals on ""right as rain"" are outstanding"
1,I hate this game!,"This is the worst racing game I have ever played!Here's why: 1. awful graphcs(the game looks like a sega saturn racing game!) 2. a lot of pop up( things just seem to pop up in front of you, and it is distracting! 3. the load times are so long that I started to get very upset. 4. you barely have any control over your car!There are a lot more reasons why this game is bad, but I returned it on the second day, so I didn't see anymore. the people who made this game obviously have no idea what they're doing, and probably don't know that DREAMCAST IS A 128 BIT SYSTEM, IS SUPPOSED TO HAVE VERY LITTLE LOAD TIME, AND NO POP UP! Don't buy it!"
2,Dissapointing,"Yes I like racers, and I love my Dreamcast. However I am very underwhelmed with this title. The graphics are sub par for a DC title. The car handling is pretty spotty, nowhere near Sega Rally 2. Yes there are some neat jumps/shortcuts and weather effects, but that has already been done on Speed Devils, which was released months ago and is far better than this title. The ""attitude"" of each driver is only a couple of highly annoying and VERY repetive 3 word phrases. Nothing special here.Why did I buy it? - well I was hoping for decent 4 player racing. I tried it out, and it is no good. You just cannot see the track ahead in the tiny window, so it is too frustrating to race. Revolt is a much better 4 player racer despite the tricky handling.Overall this is not a recommended game. It has some redeeming points, but is not as good as the other racers released months ago."
1,Horrible Shipping Habits!,Item was thrown in the box without any packaging arrived scuffed up and looking used.
4,Light fun humor,"I think this film is hysterical. I recommend it to anyone who is disgusted with corporate America. Subjects and characters portray real life situations in a satirical very funny way. If you are fed up with your job, if you are a general worker or corporate manager, watch this movie. You have to relate to someone or something in this film. Sooooo funny!!!!"
2,Movie is good - this gift set is not,"The movie is great; this review is not about the movie, about the gift set.The stapler, mug and other ""gifts"" in this set are worthless, do not even look like those in the movie. Avoid disapontment, just get a DVD."
5,The Best Movie about Mediocrity Ever,"I'll make this simple. You will either love or hate this movie. If youve EVER worked in a cubicle in an office, with co-workers and over-managing bosses you will rank this as one of your all-time favorite comedies.... On the other hand, if youve never worked in this environment you might find this to be one of the most strange and non-sensical movies ever. It comes down to being able to relate firsthand to almost all the things that make this movie so great. I was laughing from the very first scene (traffic) to the very end, (milton). Perhaps the best comedy of 1999."
5,Great Comedy,This is a fantastic comedy. It's sort of like watching Dilbert on the screen. I absolutely loved it. People who work in cubicles in particular will probably be able to relate to a lot of the comical situations. It's a definite keeper for me. I'm going to be including it in my dvd collection.
5,Great movie!,It is as hilarious now as it was the first time but now in beautiful HD. The transfer is seamless and the quality impeccable! Great buy at an AMAZIMG price!
5,I LOVE IT,This is Hollywood's funniest take on the absurdity of the modern work place. I've watched it dozens of times. Office Space is a classic movie that is definitely worth owning.
5,Training film,All large corporations should use this as a training film.Having worked for a large company this is how they work.The forms are more important than the work.
4,Truth is stanger (and funnier) than fiction!,"This movie is a must see for anyone who has worked in a ""cubicle dweller enviromnet"". This movie is much more true to life than I had expected (don't fear the dog who barks, fear the dog who quietly growls). Almost every scene in this movie has happened to me in some way, shape or form (""PC Letter Load?!?! What the ---- does that mean?!?!""). Anyone who doesn't find this movie funny must either: Never have worked in a large company, gone straight to middle management, or be utterly humorless. One of the funniest movies I have seen in a while."
4,"I'd laugh, believe me . . ..",". . . if this movie didn't hit so damned close to home it made me feel like crying at the utter pointlessness of it all. I'm talking, of course, about the satirization of cubicle misery that this movie pulls off so painfully well. I feel like giving this video to every upper level executive so they can look in the mirror at what phony squareheads their jobs have turned them into. Humans WEREN'T meant to do the same thing day in and day out until they reach their sixties. So why do we do it? Bills, that's why. I feel depressed after watching this movie, not elated. Monotony isn't a word, it's a sentence."
1,HORRIBLE!!! DO NOT BUY FROM THEM!,"I ordered the Office Space Special Edition DVD Gift set: Includes the Special Edition DVD, Red Stapler, Lumbergh Coffee Mug, Mouse Pad, Magnetic Picture Frame, Pen & Pencil Set, and TPS Report Notepad.I received only the DVD!!! Now I have to request a refund from Amazon, and ship this back and wait up to 10-15 days for a refund! JOKE!!! Amazon did not even attempt to contact the seller to see if the Gift Set was accidentally not included in the shipping. And as for ""Amazon"" filling the order, what kind of IDIOT would fill an order which says ""DVD GIFT SET"" and only put a DVD in the box which was $48.68. Ridiculous! NOT HAPPY WITH SELLER AND NOT HAPPY WITH AMAZON!!!!"
4,Something some of us can definitely! relate to,"Only people who have ever spent thier days in a Cubicle/DWA(Designated work area)/Roofless Storage Shed, can really appreciate the comedy/tragedy of Dilbert. In that same context, only people who have ever called your boss a dumbass/$#(ker, really get what Office Space is about. It hit home for me, as I laughed at a rendition of my own once lived period. Those who gave low ratings probably never went through a expendable pee-on job experience. So to those, I personally apologize if your champagne & caviar soiree' turned sour with this movie.I would strongly emplore that you see experience this movie if you have ever had a job just to HAVE a job."
5,"Actually, I see this movie every day ---where I am employed six days aweek!","At my employer's facility we have every one of these characters except for Jennifer Anderson! We had two supervisors that were assigned to offices with no windows and one door. One office was originally a paint closet. The other office was a storage locker. Each of the supervisors staid in their respective 'closet' for twelve years. Granted, they were amazingly normal considering their circumstances.This flick must have been written by someone in our company. Yes, even the red stapler and the guy relocated to the basement! This flick will be mandatory for arson investigators."
1,Get out of your cubicle and see some real comedy!!!,"... Although this movie has a few moments that will bring a smile to your face (the same kind of smile you get as you pass gas), it is certainly not among the best comedic efforts of all time-.......A much better film in the same vein would be Bruce Robinson's HOW TO GET AHEAD IN ADVERTISING <Criterion Collection>(Executively produced by George Harrison)...Even some episodes of the Drew Carey show, and the old Mary Tyler Moore TV Series are better than this film!"
1,Not appropriate for those with good taste.,Although this movie had a lot of potential it was far from reaching that potential. The sound track used Rap music that was full of nasty langauge and poor moral messages. There were totally inappropriate scenes that added absolutely nothing to the movie except perhaps offend peoples sensitivities. This movie is definately not for youger members of the family. My opinion is to just let this movie fade into the dirt where it belongs.
5,It is Just a new Classic in office-jokes-sarcasm,"Just hilarious, and here to stay as basic reference for living in corporate America. Four Thumps Up!"
1,B Movie,"It really scares me that so many people thought this movie was funny. If your IQ is over 80, don't waste your time."
4,Best use of a soundtrack that I can remember,"All of the preceding reviews were very true to the film but left one thing out - the soundtrack. The idea of a hardcore rap soundtrack for a film about a bunch of white people working in an office would seem ridiculous, but I've rarely seen a better use of songs during a movie. Right from the start, with Michael Bolton singing along to gangsta rap in his car, the soundtrack was an integral part of the film, rather than a few songs heard in the background during street scenes so they could be included on an album. I actually was so impressed with the use of music in the film that I didn't catch some of the subtler humor until I watched it a second time. I'll never get over the perfect joining of the slow motion action on screen during the execution of the scam, with the song 'it feels good to be a gangsta' being played over it. It was genius."
4,Destined to be Become a Cult Hit,"Even those with the 5-star reviews can admit it: Office Space isn't that funny the first time around. I had seen it in theaters and thought it was alright, and then saw it on video, and liked it even more. The second time I saw it on video it was even better, by then everyone I was seeing it with could quote the lines and for some reason the movie was well, better.The acting isn't extraordinary, the jokes, while good, aren't as funny as some of the stuff presented in the better comedies, but Office Space is still a fun time to watch, and it sure has replay value..."
5,Essential information put forth in a personal and moving way,"In my quest to utilize this techology, I was delighted to encounter a volume that felt like it emerged from personal experience and not simply a rote tech survey. While I am not a particularly technical person, I found the information and presentation clear and direct. There is an undercurrent of personal charm I found engaging and added to my a sence of confidence in being able to do this. My wife and I are delighted with the results of what we learned and applied based on Mr Fowlers' book. Our second home in the woods was enhanced for it."
5,Favourite Jimmy album!,"As a newbie to the Texas capitol city (I've lived here barely 2 years), I've tried to see my fair share of local artists. And by far, Jimmy LaFave is THE BEST! He is what I love about Austin! Whenever he makes an appearance at the Cactus Cafe, I try to be there... And his Trails album is by far my favourite! Everyone I've ever lent this CD to has absolutely loved it... Simply, its a must have."
2,Awkward,"My mom bought this toy foor my son for Christmas last year (2010). My son is just about 2 1/2 now. I wanted a jack in the box so that my son could work on his motor skills and oppositional skills. He loves being surprised too. For the 11 months that we have owned this toy my son still can't crank the handel. I myself find it kind of awkward to do so. The toy is cute and hasn't broken (yet). The star on the front turns and clicks. My 4 month old loves when I turn it. The button for the squeaker on the back is kind of hard to push (for me). My two year old hasn't tried playing with the button because it's so hard to push (he has other toys that squeak when you push them and he can do it just well).So, in conclusion, because the toy is so awkward and hard (for a child) to manipulate our toy has been not much more than space taking up my kids' toy box."
3,Cute but nothing special,"I bought this toy for my 6 month old because she loves bright colors and musical things. I was diappointed because it bored her the moment I placed it in her hands. She was unimpressed by the pop up head, the music and the shape. It is too large for her to manipulate and though it is very durable (nothing broke on it yet and she plays tough) I don't think it was worth the money and don't recommend it."
5,You are what you pretend to be,"I generally get around to reading this book once a year. I also tend to buy it once a year as I seem to hand it out like a Jehovas Witness with a copy of WatchTower.All in all, it's not the biggest waste of my money. This is perhaps the finest literature penned in English. Read it. You will laugh when you really think you should be crying."
5,Intense,"This is an excellently written book by Vonnegut. These memoirs of a Nazi propagandist will force you to question the way you live your life. Are we who we pretend to be? Could doing evil thing for a good cause possibly make you an evil person? Is there anyting worth living for other than love. If these questions interest you, please read this book. The themes of this book will make you think."
5,"""Too openly supported evil and too secretly supported good""","I must have read this novel four times when I was in Germany, each time becoming more compelling and memorable. I am still in awe at the beauty and magic that Vonnegut uses to create this story. I have read many of his novels and none have moved me so deeply like this one. I highly recommend it to anyone who is searching for a momerable spot in history to lose themselves to. It's an excellent novel to read and ponder."
3,Softer than Russian toilet paper,"Softer than Russian toilet paper but not as soft as cotton. They get the job done and if one gets stained beyond use I am not going to lose sleep about throwing one away.After washing, they are much softer than straight out of the box.Excellent for nose-blows. Poor for cleaning glasses.Not the best I have used, but they are, after all, just cheap hankies."
3,A good rental,"This game is a lot of fun starting out, but after a couple of hours playing it it gets very monotonous. The levels all seem the same and take far too long to complete. The camera gets incresingly annoying along the way. Multiplayer is fun but gets boring fast. Rent it for a blast but I wouldn't recommend buying."
2,Don't buy it...,"Don't buy this game. I've been playing it recently, and although the graphics and gameplay aren't bad, everything else is, especially the cameras. When you're playing, the automatic camera angles are horrible, and I find myself often readjusting them manualy. It becomes almost impossible to fight more than two other men at the same time without dying, because you need to see them to shoot them, and therefore have to readjust the cameras; two shots later and I'm dead. Quite frustrating. Also, the game only has 4 guns, a pistol with unlimited ammo, and shotgun with little ammo, a automatic but not very powerful rifle with limited ammo, and a rocket launcher, with only four rockets. There is also C4 explosives. This does not make for very fun gameplay. If I were you, I would put your money towards another first person shooter, such as GoldenEye 007 or something newer."
4,Very good movie is this one...,"This film was as good as the Oscar it won. Now I hope for the American DVD studios to also bring to our shores Caroline Link's other famous German films she directed, especially 1999's ""Puenktchen & Anton"", based on a famous 1935 children's novel by Erich Kaestner. This latter film is a very interesting story for children; I believe the book was translated to English sometime (at least it was translated to Spanish, I recall). Not only was ""Puenktchen & Anton"" directed by Link, it also starred ""Nowhere in Africa's"" actress Juliane Koehler as Puenktchen's mother, a role she impressively played."
4,Freedom,"This movie was very enjoyable by both young and old. I especially enjoyed it because of my love of horses and the idea of setting the horse free, the way they should be"
1,might as well be in Greek,"Basic primitives? Professor Milner, If you are writing a book for students, it helps if you make it comprehensible. We didn't all go to Cambridge."
5,You Can Analyze Handwritting,"Here at last is a book that simply and lucidly teaches you the extraordinary science fo Graphology. With clear, step-by-step directions, Robert Holder's new easy method of handwriting analysis enables you - in virtually no time at all - to make accurate character evaluations, uncover hidden personality traits, and even foretell future actionsWhether you're simply curious or purely practical. the dozens of illustrations, detailed persoality descriptions, Grapho-guides, and valuable tips included provide you with all the information necessary for starting a fascinating hobby which can lead to a profitable career.--- from book's first end page"
5,Your little scientist will LOVE it,"You must buy this book. It is packed with learning activities for children.One example: The section on caves in this book has your kids creating stalactites (it's not *too* messy, Mom) and discovering how surface precipitation dissolves limestone to create caverns. I love hands-on books, and this one has plenty of science projects for your kids to do with (and this is important) MINIMAL PARENTAL HELP.Your seven-year-olds and up will be on fire to learn more. Even littler brothers and sisters can get in on the excitement with rock collections and plate tectonics... this book can't be beat."
4,Fun and informative book!,"I ordered this book for my son, he is a budding scientist and fascinated with geology. He is really enjoying reading through the book. He is an advanced reader but the book is formatted to be easy for anyone to understand also. Nice book!"
2,Mortyr - Just another Mortyr among all the horrible games,"Mortyr is not the fun entertaining game that one may think it to be. It is much like the Doom and Wolfenstein games. It falls short compared to No One Lives Forever, Aliens vs. Predator, Deus Ex, and Unreal Tournament. This game is quite dull and there is barely any artificial intelligence between the enemies and the player. Hold out on buying this game. There are limited weapons. There are more anticipating 3D shooters out there such as Aliens vs. Predator 2 and Command and Conquer: Renegade.Gameplay = 6/10Graphics = 5/10Sound = 5/10Value = 5/10"
3,Woman Called Fancy,A woman called Fancy fled from an arranged marriage by her father. She was very naive with little education but held her head high with honor and integrity. She figured out how to raise herself without lowering her standards and fell in love with Court Brantly. The story is very well written but I don't think Court Brantley deserved her. Women's liberation certainly needed to be a part of this story as Fancy put up with a lot of hogwash from the men in her life. I would have liked for her to put Court Brantley out on his undeserving butt!
3,"Thought this was a best of with studio cuts, but really enjoyed the hearing The Alarm LIVE.","BEWARE! THIS IS A LIVE ALBUM! The title should be charged. I felt tricked into buying this. I would have given it 5 stars, but a LIVE long play should reflect that in the long play title. I got to looking at the song titles and the amount of songs and listened to it and decided not to bitch. I really liked the their version of Rockin' In The Free World, Medley: Stairway To Heaven, Pinball Wizard, My Generation, The Stand and their trademark songs, Rain In The Summertime, And Sixty Eight Guns. It is well worth the price, if you like LIVE long plays."
2,MC 5 -'Greatest Hits Live' (Purple Pyramid),"Here's a disc that should've been titled 'Raw Live Cuts' or maybe 'Bootleg Bits Of Home Tapes'. The first three songs ""Rambling Rose"",""Kick Out The Jams"" and ""Come Together"" are of rather dismal sound quality, but rest assure, 'Greatest Hits Live' does get better. Decent sounding tracks would be ""Rocket Reducer #62"", the bootie-stomping ""Looking At You"", ""Human Being Lawnmower"", ""Borderline"",""I Want You"", and ""Black To Comm"". Keep in mind that these songs do have MUCH of a bootleg vibe to them. There are a few covers like James Brown's ""Cold Sweat"" and Cream's ""Born Under A Bad Sign"". It's more than safe to say that 'Greatest...' is aimed toward collectors and MC 5 completists."
5,Love this glass,"A beautiful, delicate glass for sparkling water or an ice-cold beer. Perfect for weekend relaxing, looks great and makes the beverage more enjoyable."
5,"Superb Engineering, Materials.","The Riedel H2O Highball glass is such a nice, simple design. It feels great in the hand and on the lips. It's diameter and thin, clean-cut walls enhance this experience. Sparkling beverages like beer are truly sublime to drink from and view in these.A small, easy-to-remove adhesive sticker on the glass claims it's made of lead-free, tyrol crystal. It certainly feels to be of a very high quality, almost ""lab grade"" material in it's smoothness, cut, clarity, thickness consistency and precision.A possible bonus for film, robotic, or extracted juice/smoothie geeks: I'm not certain, but pretty sure this is the actual brand/model of glassware prop used in the movie Iron Man by character, Tony Stark, as he drinks the blended, green smoothie during a late-night engineering session in his drafting design lab.To your health!"
2,not for us,My husband and I are Riedel fans and have lots of their stemware and smaller glasses. But this was a miss for us.Clunky shape and not easy to drink out of. Not a great design.Stick with their old standards!
4,"Count your blessings, not the commas!","Although I sometimes have difficulty concentrating while reading, I did not have any trouble zipping through this extremely interesting book about both Robert and Jay. I laughed and cried and swore, I hated their mother and the stupid mental health professionals, I counted my blessings. I also found the writing as irritating as one of other reviewers did, but I just kept on going for an overall revealing, enjoyable reading experience. Convoluted sentences are hardly the Neugeboren brothers' biggest problems. Thanks, Jay--and Robert."
5,Great replacement product.,Purchased a new set of tail lights for my '98 Explorer because the old ones were cracked.The new ones are an exact fit and are easy to install.
4,Hilarious!,I can't add much to what's already been said except all who watch these classic shows with us burst out laughing alot.
3,Amusing,"I thought this was hilarious when I was a kid, and a lot of it is still quite funny. I enjoyed it quite a bit."
3,"Great book, but not ""American English""","We have looked high and low for this book to replace the one my daughter tore up as a baby. Finally found it here but it's different than the one we had as it's written in ""British English"" using words like ""mummy"" instead of ""mommy"", and certain phrasings being awkward and different. This is not necessarily a bad thing, but I was a little annoyed that this wasn't mentioned anywhere in the title or description."
4,Great songs!,"...This music is great! I don't really like most new synthpop bands but these guys do a great job. Great production, solid song writing, great vocalist. I saw them live and bought their CD on the spot. I highly recommend this CD if you want some up beat but no cheesy synthpop..."
2,Very unhappy with Apple customer service,Bought an ibook and when i cleaned the screen with plain water and damp rag it left many small white spots.Calling them was terrible. Can't get an RMA and it's only 2 weeks old.
1,Perfect for people who never intend to use it,"Apple makes some of the best computers in the world. Many years ago this was one of them. Today it is an outdated piece of plastic. I bought this computer about four years ago and it was low-end then. I just replaced it because it crawled like a slug. I guess in order to have a ""low priced"" computer Apple figures it can just keep selling it's most out of date systems until people catch on. Oh well, I recognize that like any big company they are in this for the money.The only plus I can give it is size. If you don't want to use a computer and you need to keep it in a small drawer, then this may be what you are looking for."
5,Intriguing book,"I wanted to understand the differing philosophies of women from these 3 different religious backgrounds. This book does a wonderful, non-judgemental job of presenting their thoughts and conclusions concerning women's role in the home, the workplace and the church."
5,"Clever, funny and delightfully wacked!","I bought All in the Timing after being a part of a production of ""Words, words, words"", ""Variations on the Death of Trotsky"", ""The Philadelphia"" and ""Sure Thing"". After enjoying immensly the 12 times I saw these performed, I found out that there were more! I immediately bought the complete collection and have been laughing my head off ever since. I read them over and over and loan the book to all my friends who appreciate comedy. If you need a good laugh, read ""All in the Timing."""
1,junk.,"Maybe a professional could put this on, but this thing was impossible to apply, I had to throw it away. The back wax paper that its stuck to isn't cut in the middle so you can peel half off, so you have to try to cut it yourself. Terrible. Unless you are or are taking it to a professional, pass this one by."
5,A Snapshot of a time and a place,"In retrospect, there is no better snapshot of New York City during the 1980's than THE BONFIRE OF THE VANITIES. This novel completely captures the energy, and even the euphoria, which crept into city life during a decade that now seems far removed.BONFIRE is an engrossing novel, interweaving all of the many aspects of city life, from the self-indulgences of the newly (very) rich to the struggles of the ghetto poor. Much like that proverbial first potato chip, once a reader gets a taste of this book, it is hard to stop reading until the final resolution. Wolfe writes a detailed and informative story in his typical lively style.Anyone who wants to remember New York City during the overheated 80's will find THE BONFIRE OF THE VANITIES to be a clear snapshot of that time and that place."
5,Modern classic,"Bonfire of the Vanities is a marvelous achievement: By turns, it doubles you over with laughter, causes you to pause and linger over a sublimely-written paragraph and shocks you into confronting the realities of our modern day institutions. The language is not for the faint-hearted -- beware. But as social satire and commentary, you're likely to find few equals."
5,Timeless Classic,"I am not a literature buff. I do not often take the time to read novels, but when I do I want to pick good books. This is one of those books. If you are not hooked by the first hundred pages you need to reread it and pay closer attention."
1,General Books LLC Version of this book is a joke,"I've only read the first 100 pages and the book is excellent. The publishing of the book is unbeleivably bad, however. I can't even believe they could sell such a thing. There are probably 20 types per page. ItIsVeryCommonForWordsToBeSmashedTogetherlikeThis. W often appears as \V. 8 1/2 appears as 8V2. If you appreciate puzzles you may like this version, but if you actually want to know the story as Tom Wolfe intended it, you should skip this version and anything published by General Books LLC."
2,"Great book, bad Kindle edition","I already own this book, just purchased the Kindle edition and it is disappointing. It just looks like a badly scanned pdf."
3,Soul Searching Journal,"This book is very cool. Most of the things are really cool to learn and do, Its def. worth reading"
3,"I wrote a review, but for some reason","It ended up in the discussion area, so please read that. Poor Stan Lee, his mighty ship has been taken over by the rats!"
3,limited in its bio's,"Though the book is imformative, the bios are very limited. There are no scales to properly determine strength and intelligence. Also there are a lot of typos, leading me to believe that they didn't care much when they created this. If you want a short overview on marvel characters then this book is for you, otherwise don't bother."
5,Mandatory Marvel,"Every Marvel fan needs this book, the guide, the manual, the stories behind the stories, the link that ties it all together! If you wonder which version of Marvel reference you should get, this is THE ONE!"
4,Not just for comic book fans,"To begin with, I am not a comic book reader. I am, however, a fan of several animated TV shows that feature Marvel characters(X-Men, Iron Man, Spiderman & His Amazing Friends, etc). I wanted to know the back story on them, so I got this book (along with the DC Encyclopedia).The characters are featured in alphabetical order. We are given a brief but detailed history along with at least one illustration. There is also a profile that lists their ""real"" name, occupation, height, weight, eye/hair color, & a list of their powers or talents. The more prominent the character, the larger their layout is.The hardcover is fairly large. I have looked through it several times & have learned a lot. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because the DC version seemed to be a little more thorough. For instance, it includes each characters hero/villain status while the Marvel book doesn't. For a non-comic fan, like me, that info would be nice to have up-front."
4,very pleased,"I took this product for years and had great hair and skin. I switched to a synthetic source,palmate, and my hair started to fall out very quickly. I am back although I do not care for the soy oil which I have read is not good for us and to be avoided."
1,Very dangerous!!! Avoid if you don't want liver cancer.,I have been using this for months and a few days ago I have realized that my liver has been seriously damaged. Apparently this dosage is dangerously high. It's 5 times higher than recommended dosage.I hope my pregnant wife will not have problems with the baby is born as she was using it too. Regardless I will probably sue this company and perhaps Amazon if they don't reach out to me before that.
4,Results?,"NOW is a well known brand, and this product does deliver. The results from the Vitamin A has not been that clear, but then again...I take so many supplements that I wouldn't know where the results came from. My face has made a noticeable improvement though so I would recommend it."
1,Save Your Money!,"After reading what this headphones could do, I was excited and couldn't wait to get one for myself. It turns out to be just another cheezy headphones. The quality is horrible, and it's not comfortable as it claims to be. Bottom line, ""Save your money!"""
3,There is better McDermott literature out there,"The setting is 1960's Long Island. Two high school sweethearts, each with their own family secrets, become loves. Sheryl becomes pregnant, contact between the two is banned, so Rick comes on That Night to rescue his sweetheart from her parents' household prison. Our narrator is a young neighbor of Sheryl who observed the romance and aftermath from an innocent distance.This is a melancholy novel filled with beautiful prose and description, but I agree with other readers that it doesn't necessarily go anywhere or hold your attention. This is more of a piece to be studied than a novel to enjoy. I wouldn't read it again."
3,Half good,"Disc 1 is not worth listening to if you are a fan of the original Asia line-up, yet disc two (all acoustic) has some redeeming qualities and seems to be the best way to hear the personnel of Asia on this 2 disc live recording."
3,Song Review,"This review is based on a person who doesn't have a computer and can't order online. She bought this CD because I had to replace Vol. 1 for her. She liked it because the songs are from her era, but she didn't know some of them. She was hoping that they would've put songs on the CD that she knew were on the top hit list of the time period. All-in-all she give the album ""a thumb's up""."
2,Not Good,I thought this was going to be much better than it was. I had high expectations because of the good things I've heard about CS Lewis but I was very disappointed.
3,Bad cut,"the content of the book is undoubtedly good. However,the edge of the book is rough due to bad cut.I returned the book and got a new one but still the publisher did not inspect properly this book condition before they release it."
1,Preaching to the Converted,"C.S. Lewis is without doubt the finest Christian apologetic who ever lived. While reading ""Mere Christianity,"" I could not help being impressed with his persuasive writing style and heart-felt conviction. Upon closer inspection, however, subtle ambiguities come to light. Though they are too numerous to mention here, suffice it to say that Lewis relies on emotion rather than logic and empiricism to reach his ""logical"" conclusions. On the positive side is his irreproachabe sincerity: C.S. Lewis is one of the few men who give Christians a GOOD name. Regardless of his faith, he was a lion of a man and scholar, and his kind is sorely missed. Too bad he, like so many others, preferred comfort to the Truth."
1,Truth and lies,"I have been surprised just how little CS Lewis bases his theology on the Bible. He has some interesting ideas, but often writes things that are confusing or just plain untrue. He writes as though evolution is a substantiated fact, but really it is just people's ideas and it contradicts the Bible. He bases a lot of his ideas about our behavior on what seems like a good idea, with no reference to the Bible. He doesn't give the impression that he was very familiar with the Bible. He appears to have been heavily influenced by human philosophies and tries to incorporate them into a religious framework."
4,Great Book,I needed it for a college course. It definitely provokes a lot of thought. Very interesting . I still have it. It is kind of a confusing read only because of the language used.
5,A pivotal work for anyone examining Christ and faith,"Despite its critics, who usually don't successfully supply reasons or specific citations as support for their accusations, ""Mere Christianity"" continues to reveal just how deep faith in Christ is and how well it holds up against nearly all examinations and critiques (after all, it is faith, not scientific process or theory...theory also requiring belief...I digress).Lewis is clear, concise (for the most part) and takes the reader on a ride that tickles the mind while strengthening the soul.In essence, this book opens up a discussion about the legitimacy that faith, specifically in Christ, has in the grand scope of human interaction, culture and ideas.With the more recently and the less, to be honest, inspiring, ""Simply Christian,"" by N.T. Wright, Lewis will always be relevant to the thinking follower of Christ who will not become complacent in thought or life."
2,Brimming with Hellfire,"I found myself fearful of the Christian religion. After I read this I felt like saying to myself, ""Thanks Jesus, since I don't believe in you I suppose I am going to Hell - thanks for being such a great sport!""A Christian friend reccommended this book to me and at times the book was threatining and downright scary. I suppose if I were a fundamentalist I would be applauding his prose, but as a non-Christian I find it frightening that people believe this stuff"
2,Mere is right,"We all share a common morality.Therefore, God.Mostly a waste of time. If the contents of this book are an example of what Lewis considers a cogent argument, then it's no wonder that he believes what he believes. Basically for believers who need reaffirming."
3,Mere Christianity,I was disappointed in the quality of this book. The edges of the pages are all raggedy. I expected better quality.
3,"Problematic, but good","Many of the 'bad' reviews given to this book have a point. Mere Christianity is over-simplistic and does have it's logical flaws. Appealing to a 'common morality' among all people is simply too problematic to be useful as a apologetic. He has certainly written better books (see 'The Abolition of Man').That said, there are redeeming qualities to the book. Overall, it is smart and educated. Not all of the arguments Lewis uses are so problematic as the aforementioned. And it certainly cannot be dismissed as quickly as some have (after 5 chapters in one case apparently). This is a book that should be treated seriously, for there is much to give thought to.In the end, there are better books of Christian apologetics. G.K. Chesterson's Orthodoxy being one of the best."
4,A Pleasant Appeal,"I read this when I was first becoming interested in Christianity. It isn't heavy-handed. It actually doesn't really go into much theological argument at all. It basically sets a stage of ""why"" one should believe. There was a great chapter on ""Pride""- a non-believer would probably even enjoy."
5,For the casual reader and the avid fan alike,"This is a beautiful book, and from my experience, you will not find it in stores for less than $60. It was delivered on time, in perfect condition, and cost a lot less (including shipping), than it was in stores. This makes a beautiful gift or addition to a personal collection."
5,the best defense of christianity that i have read,"CS Lewis makes the case for Christianity in this brilliant work. For those looking for an intellectual approach to the faith look no further. Lewis, a former atheist and Oxford man of letters, is a joy to read. Thank God for him."
5,Christianity never makes a better sense!,"Mere Christianity is an excellently thorough treatise on basic Christian beliefs. Lewis shows that Christianity is not about endless doctrinal debates within hundreds of denominations. Quite on the contrary, it unites all its believers round the world into one community, distinguished from the rest by a uniform radical stance towards humanity and God. This book defines Christianity in its true spirit, and is a must for someone who is searching for why he ought not to be ashamed for being a faithful Christian"
5,A logical review of Christian beliefs,"I found this book very well written. C.S. Lewis has a way of leading the reader through a logical progression of thoughts and uses examples that you can relate to in explaining various principles throughout the book. It's a good overview of Christianity for someone seeking the basic framework of beliefs agreed upon by all Christians, regardless of the particular religious expression of those beliefs (i.e.- Catholic, Protestant, born again Christians, etc.)."
2,It was OK.,"Kind of entertaining. The female lead was too annoying. That role in this type of movie usually is, but she was over the top annoying. Some pretty creepy elements. surprising story..."
1,awful,"this movie was so stupid, not scarey in any way at all and barely got through much of it before hitting delete."
2,Too thin,"I wanted to like these pants so bad. I'm 5'8'' 135 Lbs and they were too short for me. I guess I'm a little anal when it comes to my pants being long enough, but regardless, they were way too thin. I have a pair of Adidas and prefer their dry-fit fabric over these. These are for sure a summer pant."
1,Why do people like this?,"The costumes and sets aren't too bad, but otherwise this looks like a bad TV movie from the 70s usually does. I agree that there is less of the melodrama than in Cecil DeMille's film, but the writing and acting are still painful to watch, and the picture is always dark. It must be that people feel nostalgic about something from years gone by, because this movie looks so very bad compared to classics of the past and modern filmmaking."
5,"Great book about modular origami, not for the impatient","Fuse has written a book all about one of her favorite areas of origmami: modular creations. Modular origami is created when you fold multiple copies of the same unit and then work them together to create a larger model. It looks gorgeous, but can be very time consuming and frustrating if your model is made of 60 units. I like this book alot, but it is clear that Fuse's ability to fold is light years beyond mine. Still, she always gives clear directions and diagramms so that if you are patient you can make gorgeous models."
4,"Very hard, yet fun and addicting","This game has one of the steepest learning curves to ever meet the Playstation. It is unbelieveably realistic and can be a very fun game if you have the skills for it. The training mode is very helpful and must be used in order to play the game. RC Stunt Copter may cause frustration at first, but given time, can be a very fun and realistic simulation."
4,The Uke is Back!,"If the word on the street that the ukulele is ""back"" is true, then this CD certainly proves it. Dan Sawyer's been on the live uke circuit for a while and I'm glad that he's finally packaged this group of mostly instrumentals for easier consumption. And an eclectic group , indeed! His chops are supported by his love for the uke as he showcases his ""tiny wonder"" in varying types of music. The banjo flair on ""Fleas in the Grass"", the groovy blues of ""Can't Refuse"" and the melancholy ""Uke Noir"" all confirm the versatility of the instrument. DS keeps the songs simple and the playing fun, inviting you to jam right along. But the highlight for me is ""It's Uke Time!"" where he lends his friendly voice to a swinging romp of a tune and completes the overall feel of the album in this celebration of the ukulele."
2,Solid math review but lacks application for the SAT,"Having tested many books that deal with the SAT I was positively surprised by the depth this book provided. The problem is the fact that the sample questions in it do not really reflect the real SAT-test and can only be used to study the math or the critical thinking skills.Also, dont plan to use this book to brush up your vocabulary - the included word-list provides you with only the meanings of the words and not with a sample sentence.This book might be suitable for usage in combination with 10 Real SATs or some other book that features more realistic SAT questions."
1,Aimless and self-absorbed,This book was one of the most boring books I've had to read in a long time. I found the writing to be unimaginative and felt like the book had no direction. I was very disappointed and had forgotten it before it was even finished.
3,"A Classic, but Narrow","A self-serving autobiographical reflection. In very few moments of this book does Norris step outside herself and her own ""needs."" Clearly, this is a woman who has too much time on her hands."
3,These are professional dodgeball players?,"The Dodgeball tournament near the end of the movie just SUCKS. These guys suck at dodgeball. I could kick their (butt) any day. That tournament is the most predictable thing i've ever seen. Everybody knew which two teams were gonna make it to the final. this movie could have been stretched out some more. it seems like the people who made it just wanted to rush through the final half of the movie. I was disappointed after watching this movie.This movie, however, does have some really funny parts. I loved Patches, and Ben Stiller's Part. The movie starts out great, but the ending in this movie is just not good. We all knew who was gonna win the thing.I think it still is worth watching, but not worth buying. . I give this movie a 2.8 out of 5."
4,Laughed so hard people stared,"This movie is so funny. We watched it on a plane ride coming from California and we laughed so hard people turned around to look at us. The humor is infantile, but take it for what it is and you will laugh your (...)off."
1,sucky,"this movie blows, im so sick of these lame comedies can't anyone make a funny movie anymore instead of crap like this and 50 First Dates or the worst of them all Anchorman, if you want something to laugh at i recommend buying a season of Wildboyz. I rented Dodgeball and i still feel ripped off!"
3,Not bad,"Dodgeball has a lot of funny parts, but its not the best movie out their. The only reason I bought this movie was because Ben Stiller, Christine Taylor, and Vince Vaughn star in it. I thought this movie was going to be one of the best. Maybe I'm just not a dodgeball fan. Either way I wouldn't give this movie Five stars."
3,A Lightweight Comedy,"This is a mildly entertaining comedy with quite a few funny moments. Vince does a good job of carrying the film as straight man. Ben Stiller's performance is way over the top, as the vain eccentric evil rich guy. The supporting cast is adequate. Too much of the humor is a cliche, dodgeball players get hit in the groin. Vince seemed a bit overweight and out of shape. Overall, the movie is good for a few laughs."
4,I admit it. I loved it.,"I don't usually go for this kind of comedy, but most of this movie slayed me. Director/writer Thurber makes the movie a winner with flying wrenches, a pirate, and the entire cast getting pelted in the face with at least one dodgeball. This movie is tasteless, crass, lowbrow and appeals to the worst in all of us. My worst laughed its tookis off. The David Hasselhoff cameo alone is worth it. Get off your high horse and see this, and break up with anyone who didnt like it."
2,Borrow it.,"Lance Armstrong has the funniest scene in this movie, and that's no strike at the pedaler. It is legitimately funny. Other funny shizzle:1) Numerous shots to the bathing suit parts (Immature? Yes. Always funny? Yes.)2) A bar is named after something disgusting/funny/disgusting again.3) Vince Vaughn occasionally reminds you that his dry wit still exists.4) The blooper scene with the ref--""Laughing really ....""5) The ""alternate"" ending.All told, this list comprises roughly three and one half minutes of the movie. After the tag-team debacle that is Starsky-->Dodgeball, it will be difficult for me to go see another heavily pimped Stiller production.""Laughing the whole movie...""""Funniest movie I've ever seen...""""Non-stop hilarity...""?"
3,Not the film version,"I do love this movie, but there were parts that were cut out, and those were my favorites...will buy the theatre version next time"
5,Hilarious.,"Dodgeball is great. Stiller is funny as always (a little bit of Heavy Weights in his character) The supporting cast is great, with Taylor, Roots, Cole, and Bateman. The cameos will also make you laugh. Very enjoyable."
4,Everybody loves to see a good wrench-to-the-head scene,"Ok, very funny movie. Quite a bit of language from Rip Torn, although it's funny/embarrasing. I don't think the Unrated version is any better than the other cut. So what ever's cheaper."
3,A movie with balls!,"I didn't expect too much out of this movie. But it was actually funnier than I thought it would be. I'm not at all a Ben Stiller fan, but he was pretty funny in this. I can't believe how much the girl in this movie, looks like Marcia from the Brady bunch! The resemblance is unbelievable! It's good for a few laughs. Definitely not a movie for young kids."
1,Dodge These,"This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Literally, I could not get through it. It's juevenile, stupid, obvious humor, that treats the audience like idiots. It's sad to see Ben Stiller become an overacting film destroyer, but you can't blame this one on him. Even Vince Vaughn seemed awkward in this terrible movie, like he knew each line he delivered was worse than the previous one. Awful and horrible. I knew someone who was on a plane that showed this movie and she cimbed into the overhead compartment for the rest of the ride.If you liked this movie, I have some great footage of a dog chasing its tail for three hours that I'm sure you would enjoy."
2,Meh.,"I review this movie not despite the fact that I fell asleep while watching it, but because of that fact.I watched the movie with my a group of my friends. We were at my best friend's place. When somebody suggested that we watched this film I wasn't crazy about the idea, but I was overruled.It was okay. I laughed once, one of about twenty-three times I've laughed during a movie. But for the most part it was dull and unfunny. The acting was trash and the characters were easy to detest, especially the stupid bad guy.I drifted off about the time the guy got hit by the car. And I've got no regrets."
2,Balls,"There is nothing I like more than a movie about balls. I like it when the whole plot is based around big hairy balls. Would you believe that in this movie they are throwing their balls at each other while Ben Stiller tries to act like he knows how to act. Oh sure, Stiller is the villan in the movie. But he is about as convincing as a stick of butter is tough in the microwave. The only reason I gave this movie two stars is because I like balls."
5,I recommend this seller,I got the book exactly came how the seller said it was. It was fast shipping and in great condition. Thank you so much.
5,Wonderfully written love story from Spanish California.,I truly enjoyed this wonderfully written work by Helen Hunt Jackson. It is definitely her best! The love story shows how badly Native Americans and the Spanish living in California were cheated out of their land. I would recommend it to any student that has to read an Accelerated Reader book for school!
4,Ramona inspires Drama,"As a playwright, I haven't been inspired to adapt a novel until I read Ramona. What works for me? The melodrama is, after all, average, and the love story...a little predictable. But there's something audacious about author Helen Hunt Jackson and her bold ""Mother Jones"" muckraking persona that constantly reminds you throughout the pages about the injustices committed against Native Americans. Yet, in spite of this heavy message, there's something utterly fascinating about its main characters--the beautiful Ramona, the daring Alessandro, the unforgiving Senora, even the wimpy Felipe. They create a powerful scenario worthy of intelligent, passionate drama. I, in turn, wrote the play which has been produced at PlayWright's Theater in Phoenix and at Arizona State University in Tempe. I've adapted the story, done my own interpretation of it, but the essence has remained the same."
3,Alternatives to the biopsychosocial model,"This book is a good review of the biopsychosocial model from its followers in the University of Rochester, disciples of George Engel. The biopsychosocial concept is however, rather oversimplistic and quite flawed in many ways, although it certainly had some advantages when it became popular in the 1980s. This book does not adequately critique the model. For such critiques, readers may be interested in my book The Concepts of Psychiatry, or Paul McHugh's The Perspectives of Psychiatry. I have proposed a pluralist model which has many of the strengths of the biopsychosocial model without many of the weaknesses, as well as having a more sound conceptual basis."
1,not so good,"The product arrived perfectly packaged. And that is where the perfection ended. It had an unpleasant and musty finish, which made it unwearable. Perhaps the scent was too old and had deteriorated. Because it was unwearable, it was returned to the sender."
2,burn baby burn,cooked 5 times in this pan and 5 times ive burned food. no luck with this pan . but it does clean up well
4,"Fine, dependable product","This is a great pan, easy to clean, sturdy - we have had many Faberware products and this one, as usual, stands out."
3,Losing the balls,"My son is 20 months and got this for X-mas....he loved it and played with it for 45 minutes the first time.....he loves balls. The problem is that he likes to throw them...so after hammering them he started to throw them. The first couple of weeks I would go around and find them, and make sure the four balls would be with the game when we were done...but after 3 months, we can no longer find half the balls, sometimes they pop-up in the toybox and under the bed, etc. If your child is actively running around the house non-stop like mine, then you will be doing alot of running too trying to find the pieces to keep the game together.....to many pieces! Plus my son tries to use the hammer on everything but the game!"
4,Should be included with the Garmin 276 or 376,"This is another product that displays the Garmin marketing scheme -- sell a bare bones base unit and then get you with the accessories that you really need. If you have any intentions to use their GPSmap 276 or 376 on the road, this kit is a mandatory buy. Otherwise, the 276 or 376 can only really be used on the water. The bean bag mount is okay, but the swivel doesn't provide the ability to tilt backwards, so it doesn't work if the unit is below eye level. Take a look at the Lowrance Iway 600c, all the automotive pieces come in the box."
5,Very Good,"We love Zatarain's Dirty Rice Mix and purchase it often in the stores.I've never noticed the cheese variety before so decided to try it.It's nice and spicy and very cheesy. We were both pleased with it, but I still like the regular Dirty Rice mix better."
1,it's for those know no math,"Not well organized, and...Very simple things are complicated by using so many words in this book.Why not use some math? It would be way much clearer than chattering interminably.it's waste of time"
4,BLAST FROM THE PAST ! !,"Takes me back to the 80's! Love seeing Nick Cage so young - along with Jim Carrey. Great to think ""What if...."""
5,Peggy Sue got Married,I have another friend who wanted this movie and could not find it and asked me to look to see if I could get it. She explained the movie to me so I knew what to look for and the details of the movie and the listing that was given when I ordered it was great. and I received it very quickly.
2,Stupid,"Although Kathleen Turner does an admirable job salvaging this film, there is very little I can do to recommend it. Nicholas Cage is painfully bad."
5,Movie for my Daughter,I bought this movie for a Christmas gift. It arrived on time and no beating the price. Always a good gift.
1,Gets dull and chips immediately,"After several use drilling 3/8"" mild steel I noticed that I already have several bits with chipped ends. These bits get dull quickly too.Made in China.Would not buy again."
2,COBALT DRILL BITS,HAVE USED THE 1/4 IN BIT ABOUT 3 TIMES AND IT IS ALREADY SHOWING SIGNS OF DULLING. VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH THE PERFORMANCE OF THE BITS THUS FAR. WOULD NOT PURCHASE AGAIN .
4,"Classic American songbook, redone.","McKeown takes a number of pages from the classic American songbook, and re-does them in her own unique fashion, from the jazzy ""Something's Gotta Give,"" to the brassy big-band sound of ""Rhode Island is Famous For You."" It's hard to stop yourself from singing along, hearing all these familiar classics.Highly recommended."
4,Where are the extras?,This is known as Barbra Streisand's signature movie. So where are all of the extra features on this DVD? There should be so many extras that it would take another DVD to fit them all in one package! This thing has nothing. Buy it because it's a great movie but don't expect any more than that.
5,FUNNY GIRL WITH BARBRA STREISAND,I PURCHASED THIS DVD OF FUNNY GIRL FOR MY BEST FRIEND FOR CHRISTMAS AND SHE WAS STUNNED THAT I WAS ABLE TO GET IT. ACCORDING TO HER IT WAS FANTASIC WATCHING IT IN THE COMFORT OF HER HOME AND HAD BEEN SEARCHING FOR IT IN AUSTRALIA FOR QUITE A LONG TIME. SO THANKS FOR GETTING IT TO ME ON TIME. I MADE HER DAYREGARDSLYN
1,Waste of time.....,"I love Motorhead!!.....Therefore I am going to be brutally honest here. This CD is not what it appears to be. The song list is decent, but no Girlschool/Motorhead (Motorschool? Girlhead?) songs are included. -As for the ""mugger"" tapes... Who wouldn""t LOVE to hear Lemmy belt out ""Cinnamon Girl"", ""Summertime Blues"" or ""Somthin' Else""?.... Well guess what, you won't here. The ""Muggers"" were a pick up band of ""Fast"" Eddie Clarke's and ""Philthy"" Animal Taylor's (original M'head members for the uneducated). Lemmy had nothing to do w/ it... and just as well. This was strictly a coverband recorded at a party with a (rightfully so) un-enthusiastic audience. Do not waste your time/money... Buy ""No Remorse"", ""1916"" & ""No Sleep til Hammersmith"".... These are ESSENTIAL listening. Oh well.. at least there is a NIN-style remake of ""Ace of Spades"" on here."
2,Quite a bit less editorializing would have been nice,"I guess I need to look a little closer at what I'm looking to check out in the future when it comes to non-fiction, as this was aimed just a LITTLE bit below my comprehension.The biggest issue with the book is that rather than presenting the facts of the various matters in a strictly historical context the author makes sure to point out how each of the individuals that had been involved in the various hoaxes - unwittingly or not - was either 1) a Snidely Whiplash-esque villain, twisting his or her mustache as the marks fell for the con, or 2) a grade a moron.In theory it wouldn't be a bad primer for this sort of thing, but you could easily glean more information from Wikipedia about each of the cases in question."
3,"This book was helpful, but kind of lenthy.","I found most of this book useful, things I learned in my education classes came up frequently. I think that this book was a bit outdated, although it did have some very relevant information. I found it a bit hard to read because of the language. The content at times was boring. On the whole, I think that this book was a good historical account on what educationally philosophy was in it's time."
3,Usable but thats it!,There is no active table of contents. Which is a pitty. But searchable on the bodytext.Usable and readable. Thank you anyway because I got it free.
4,SAD,"I had to put the book down 3/4 of the way through. It was so...........SAD. Finally, I finished. AT the same time that I was really intrigued, I was really glad it was over. I haven't read Hardy for so long. It was a welcome return."
3,consequenes,"Besides Jude the Obscure, I've read Hardy's Mayor of Casterbridge and Tess, both of which fascinated me. I find that although I don't enjoy the plot of the books necessarily, I enjoy reading them so much that I'm not able to put the book down. After I finish reading Thomas Hardy's books, I am left feeling less than enthusiastic for my future, but at the same time renewed with passion to make my future all that it can be. There is an underlying message in all of Hardy's book, one of consequences. Those who sow actions of wrongdoing will eventually reap misery. Jude gives up the things that he wants most for instant gratification."
5,Love in the air,"The story of a man of high ideals but lowly background, who throws himself into a seemingly endless fight against the conventions of his time & who finds himself torn between two women: the seductive, scheming Arabella & the intelligent, iconoclastic Sue."
4,A Brilliant Young Man Ruins His Life,"""Jude the Obscure"" is the story of the self-destructive foolishness of the highly gifted Jude Fawley (ryhmes with 'folly'), which gradually takes him from a chance to become an Oxford scholar in spite of his provincial upbringing to a pitiful death it is better not to mention. This book is a well drawn example of a tragic waste of life and of great gifts, and as such it can be seen as a masterpiece of moralism in literature. It is hardly one of my favorite books, protraying as it does the brutal self ruination of high promise, but it does not lack in quality what it is missing in consolation."
2,jude the mundane,thomas harding's overly descriptive writing style backfired in this would be entertaining novel. hardy should've realized that the harsh reception of the novel by the public was probably more because it's boring than because of the controversial text. hardy ruined a perfectly good plot with excessive description and annoying detail.
2,Not an easy read,"I didn't enjoy reading this one. I know Hardy isn't the most cheery writer, but this was beyond just depressing -- it was boring. About halfway through, I was tempted to just skip the rest but I trudged on to the bitter end.This may have been scandalous when it was published, but why couldn't Hardy have done a better job with the ending? The almost Dickensian sequence of hard-to-swallow tragedies was too contrived for my taste. Was Hardy afraid of writing a happy ending for this unconventional pair, or did he want to display the worst-case effects of a rigid social code of behavior? Either way, it all became pretty unbelievable.From a historical point of view, as a jumping-off point for a discussion of the social constraints and morals of the period, Jude is a success; it certainly seems to have set off some fireworks when it was first published. As casual reading, I can't recommend it."
3,Moves You to Depression,"This book will not put cheer in your heart. Few books I have read recently have been so consistently and methodically depressing as ""Jude."" His utter naivety in being pulled into mistake after mistake and wasting away his life makes you want to shake sense into him. The worst part is that he is not a bad man, he just makes poor decisions. Or perhaps I should say he allows others to make poor decisions for him. He wants to push societal norms on the one hand and conform to them on the other. And he, like most of us, does not have the courage or ambition to break through and achieve his goals. In the end his environment, created by his own folly, drags him down and guarantees his unhappiness. The reason for my ranking of 3-stars is that I didn't find the book compelling or particularly thought provoking. It described a situation I find often in current society. On the plus side Hardy is an excellent writer and the book moves you to emotion."
3,Clasp for straps are no good,"For women with fuller busts, this bra is great...but only for a little while. The company recently switched to metal clasps on all except the black to hold the straps because they were getting too many complaints about the plastic ones breaking...which happened to me at work. There really isn't a risk of the metal ones breaking, but the straps have a tendency to slide through the clasps just after wearing it a few times. Your strap won't break, but you won't feel secure when your breasts are inching down with every little movement you make. Until they find a better clasp I will have to look elsewhere for support."
1,"OK products, HORRIBLE warranty service","If you purchase Millennium products by Farberware do not count on getting any satisfaction if you need to use the warranty. I sent in three pieces 5 months ago for what I was told was a 6-8 week process -- I'm still waiting, and every time I call I get a different line -- they are either incompetent or lying, or both. Decent products, unacceptable customer service -- buyer beware!"
3,Great content but too much bass,"I must agree with Michael Jered Kopp of Chicago!Helen Kane had perhaps the best diction of any pop singer of the 20's and well beyond, but because of the attempt to create a sterophonic effect most of the lyrics are impossible to decipher.Anyone who has heard the great restoration of I Wanna Be Loved By You on the RCA CD Nippers Greatest Hits would be hard pressed to identify the Helen Kane here with the genuine aricle.Too bad, because the collection of songs is the most comprehensive available on one disc.I don't want Helen Kane in stereo - Helen Kane in a crisp mono would be just fine for me!"
5,Farberware is the BEST kitchenware!,"Farberware is so worth the extra money. It is easy to clean, lightweight, and excellent quality. It will cook the food evenly, and not leech terrible things into the food because it is stainless steel. I happened to come across a set of pots and pans of Farberware at a yard sale and since then I have been hooked. Now every piece I look to add to my cooking collection I try to get Farberware!!"
5,Great,This is perfect for steaming veges and for hot dogs and buns. We have used it many times in the short time we have had it. And it matches all of our existing Farberware perfectly. Definately a great buy.
4,"a good choice, but be attention of its size",The quality of the pot is really satisfactory. But it is smaller than I thought. I think amazon's given size is not that accurate. The size of pot is perfect for one or two people's needs.
4,Good Value,A good basic pot for the money. I wish it were a little larger but I had no idea how big 3-quart would be.
5,Finding Your Joy Again,"When I Don't Desire God is a great follow to Piper's Desiring God. Piper gets more practical in this book than in some of his others and he answers the tough questions that Christians face in their effort to be God centric and find joy and peace in their relationship with him.I particularly liked the fact that Piper seems to truly understand the problems that we have in every day life. He lays out great answers to these questions with a humble and understanding attitude.If you've read Piper's other books and want to receive better insight on how to implement what he writes about, this is a great book to read. I recommend When I Don't Desire God to find your joy again."
5,a pleasant surprise,"I've read a number of histories of this period and have at times seen historians' references to this book. I've considered reading it for about thirty years and finally purchased it. I had no idea what a well written and entertaining book this was. If you've any interest in the late fur trade era, you should get this one."
1,STOPED WORKING AFTER 1 MONTH AND A HALF,"this is unbelievable, i got this HDMI cable only for 1 month and a half and it does not work anymore. During the time that it did work, it often black out at times! i DO NOT recommend this to anyone, this is a unreliable cable!"
5,Its like other expensive HDMI cables,The cable eventhough cheap is well made and looks like other expensive cables. I compared the picture quality with other expensive cable that I got from bestbuy and didnt find any difference. Dont waste your money on those other expensive cables. This is awesome. I got three of these cables for the price of one expensive cable.
1,Jumpy terrible product,"This cable worked well on my PS3 for a total of about 30 minutes before the picture became jumpy and skipped. Tried games, DVD's and Blu-rays all with the same result. Completely useless."
5,they work GREAT!!! n the price is cheap and worth it,GREAT!!! cheap and well worth it they work better then the ones for 40.00 dollars at the stores love these
5,Excellent with the tiniest problem!,Works like a charm. I spent almost $4 on the same thing I'd have had to pay $50 for if GameStop was the only option. But thanks to this I paid what a TV cable is really worth.One occasional problem that happens approximately once a week is that the screen and the sound go away for about 2 seconds but very very rarely. I was going to give it a 4 star because of this but it's not as big of a deal to me. Definitely recommended...
1,XBOX 360 Glitched Out with this Cable,"I bought 2 of these cables, one for my XBOX 360 and the other for my digital cable. I was charged for shipping and handling (""S&H"") on each cable, although they came in one padded envelope relatively quickly. My first complaint, therefore, is that I was charged $5/cable for S&H for a total of $10, when the only real cost the distributor incurred was one S&H cost of $5. To make matters worse, shortly after I hooked up the HDMI cable from my XBOX 360 to my new Samsung HDTV, the screen display for my 360 glitched out and I suffered the Ring of Death shortly thereafter. I bought this cable specifically because the distributor said it was 360 compatible, and I am frustrated that using it has forced a general hardware failure in my 360...It has caused me to suffer without my 360 for the past 3 weeks, and I expect to wait another 2 weeks for Microsoft's repair center to fix my console and send it back to me."
5,Buy these cables,"After I bought my PS3, I was still using the RWY cables that came with the system. I definitely wanted to utilize the high definition aspect of my television for my PS3. The video quality is vastly superior to that when using standard cables so you need these cables."
1,terrible quality,"I bought this cable thinking that at the worst I'm wasting $2.50 on a potentially good cable...and I ended up doing just that. This cable is crap. Poor audio quality and the picture was abysmal. There were wavy lines all over the picture and it had very poor clarity (where there weren't wavy lines.) Used with 40"" Samsung"
2,it worked fine at first...,when i got it i plugged it into my xbox and worked fine about two weeks later i went on a trip and came back and it didnt work it is just too low quality i would sugest gettin a $10 or $20 one.
5,Super quality for fewer dollars,"I found this cable on Amazon at such a low price that I didn't think it could possibly be any good. However, what was available at regular retail of $30-$90 helped me to reconsider. After installation and several weeks operation, I am a believer. As with other Amazon purchases I have made, the low price is not an indicator of poor quality."
1,Does not fit in my Xbox 360,"I bought this cable for my Xbox so I can get better picture quality on my TV when playing. I received the HDMI cable fine, but when attempting to put this in the HDMI port on my Xbox, the cable would not fit because of my AV cable. Cable should be a bit thinner so both the AV cable and HDMI can fit at the same time."
5,Please Note: Most Reviews listed are for the first DVD release...,"People take note: most of the negative reviews about the picture and sound quality are for the original DVD release - not the Blu-ray release! The new, Blu-ray release quality is fantastic. So take heart! Not all is as it seems..."
5,A Cult Classic For All Ages,"I remember watching this film as a child (whether is was renting it, owning it, or seeing it on the Disney Channel) and it's one of those old classics that has managed to reappear in my movie library. I had the beat up VHS copy last and I've recently given it the upgrade it deserved (especially after the VHS mysteriously disapeared when I wasn;t home...seriously, that did happen and it sucked! But back to my review) and I have to hand it to you...The picture: MUCH clearer (and wider too), the colors: As BRIGHT and RICH as ever, and the sound: Good old America, CAN'T GET ANY BETTER than that! So there's my review, but the re-release becuase A.) It was recent and B.) You'll love it!!"
2,only if you're a childhood fan,"I hadn't seen this movie since I was four, and I was curious to watch it as a twentysomething. Verdict: if you loved it as a child, you will probably adore it for sentimental reasons. But as someone who had no attachment to it, I felt the story was loosely woven and the songs grating and dated--in fact, I skipped through them. Young children will probably enjoy it, but it is degrading to expect older children to be captivated by a story so lacking."
1,UK Version 1000 times better,I'm waiting anxiously for the Live action version of this classic. This is my ALL TIME FAVORIE Animated Movie EVER!!! I was so dissapointed at what a horrible release to DVD this was. Not only was the packaging the same crappy kiddie fare artwork as the old VHS.. but the Quality was just horrible. I shall surely be buying the UK release with all its glorious extras and and widescreen format and beautiul artwork. This US release should be an embarasment for all animation and Last Unicorn fans.
2,What a terrible dvd of such a great movie!,"I adore this movie. the animation is wonderful, the story poignant, but the dvd was terrible! They obviously hadn't touched up the old VHS at all. The picture has lots of holes and spots. I like the fullscreen format personally, but I know many people would have liked the option of widescreen. If their are bonus features like the box claims I can't find them. Overall, you will probably be better off with the VHS, which had a better picture."
1,DVD deceit,"The last unicorn is a beautiful story with memorable characters and a bittersweet ending. I saw the original on VHS as a child and it became burned into my memory even into adulthood. Last year I met Peter S. Beagle, the author of the book, at a convention and learned an unfortunate truth. Peter S. Beagle does not receive any compensation for the use of his material in the DVD format as sold by most vendors! As much as I love this story, I want to encourage people not to buy the DVD unless they purchase it through Peter's representative, conlanpress.com. You can even have him sign and personalize your DVD there! Believe me, it was a dream come true to receive my personalized copy for my birthday and it felt good to know he was getting the compensation he deserved."
5,The Last Unicorn,"One of my childhood favorites and now one of my daughters favorites. A movie I had almost forgotten. Never again, will I forget. Full of fantacy and magic. Keeps one interested."
4,Spanish audio missing,"A very good animated movie from the 80's, also a very good voice cast. Indeed it has to be considered the first movie to use famous actors to dub it, with extremely good talent - a must to say it. Very nice script, nice dessign of the character, though the unicorn is a bit too fragile..."
2,"Great movie, shoddy DVD","The Last Unicorn was my favorite movie when I was a kid. The story is sweet, the animation lovely. I eagerly bought a copy on VHS when I saw it some years ago and awaited the release of the DVD with glee.Unfortunately, my glee was somewhat unfounded. While the movie itself is still as wonderful as ever, the DVD itself is shoddy work. The movie is only presented in fullscreen (though there was a widescreen laser disc available), there are no extras -- even the picture quality is less than outstanding.If you're looking to replace a worn VHS, this is certainly a good option. If, on the other hand, you are waiting for a DVD treatment worthy of this beautiful movie, you have more waiting ahead of you."
3,"""---- you, where have you been?""","I love this movie dearly, and I'm glad they put it out on DVD. But I will never understand why they edited out the tiny bits of occasional profanity (""hell"" and ""damn""). Censoring is for TV, when you don't know who might suddenly flip to your channel. It is not for DVDs purchased for the home library. This DVD has a huge following of loyal fans who know the script by heart, and it's very hard to be jerked out of the moment by the realization that something crucial is missing. It's like Rhett Butler saying ""Frankly, my dear, I don't give a care.""I also wish they'd gone to a little more effort to making the 25th anniversary edition a little more interesting.If you'd like some of the money from your purchase to go to the author/screenwriter, Peter S. Beagle, please buy the video from Conlan Press. For $25, you get a personally autographed copy."
2,"Well-made film, but terrible DVD!","Rankin-Bass' The Last Unicorn has held up surprisingly well as a film, but the DVD treatment it's received is just insulting. With jittery grain, scratches, and dirt marring every scene, a dark and muddy look, out-of-focus transfer, scratchy audio, and insulting pan-and-scan (yes, there are scenes where two people are speaking and NOBODY's in the frame!), it's barely watchable. Add to that the complete lack of extras and you're better off buying this one on VHS."
5,"Still stunning, still a great message for girls","I hate unicorns. I hate the color pastel pink. They both feature prominently in this movie, and I I love them here. This is a wonderful allegory for girls who must grow up or for those who already have. It's romantic, but with a great indictment of show business, man's road, and those who rule over barren lands... Every woman ought to enjoy this. Fight the red bull!"
5,perfect,this movie was perfect and shipped fast i tell every one i know to buy it and it was cheapper then buying it at f.y.e
3,DVD leaves something to be desired,"I've loved both the written and animated versions of ""The Last Unicorn"" since I was a kidlet. I recently bought the DVD and was sorely disappointed in the quality of the DVD video and sound.I found I still am just as in love with the story as before, but I'll either purchase the German version (unedited dialogue, widescreen, cleaned up colors, Dolby 5.1, trailer, cast profiles, etc.) or the UK version (unedited dialogue, cleaned up color, Dolby 2.0, trailer, cast profiles) or (most likely) wait for a well-done release with Special Features that are more than Scene Selection.I hope it comes out soon!"
1,Simply aweful,"The storyline is well constructed, but the audio acting is terrible --- makes an adult cringe. For the musically challenged, the singing can be tolerable otherwise prepare for projectile vomiting. My younger children love the movie, but the older ones ""loathe"" (my 10-year-old daughter's word) it. I really wish they would redo this story with actors that have talent."
4,dvd IS bad but buy it anyway,"i never buy full frame DVDs of movies, widescreen is the way to go, and the critics are right, not only is The Last Unicorn DVD full frame but the picture is all dark and muddy, but this is such a dear enchanting film with some of the best voice acting ever found in an animated picture (i never cry at movies, especially animated ones, but this thing had me bawling at two scenes (you know which ones they are)) that i can't NOT recommend buying it."
3,I found it a little tedious...,"... but my 8 year old daughter LOVED it.The G-rating, however, is a little misleading. The movie contains language and a 'sex' scene (can you have sex with a TREE?) that would have kept me from purchasing for an 8 year old had i known. As it is, we fast forward the tree scene, but the language..?"
3,Fascinating,"A fascinating album of tracks from the 1950s featuring Jimmy Rogers who was best known as 2nd guitar to Muddy Walters but whose guitar and vocals was not likely to cause other musicians to slit their wrists. I personally love the tracks that include Little Walter who I consider was probably the greatest ever exponent of the harmonica. Other musicians on the album include Muddy Walters, Willie Dixon, Otis Spann and Big Walter Horton (on one track). Not all of the album stands the test of time which is why I have only given it 3 stars, but to be able to hear more of Little Walter is worth the rest. Just listen to 'Sloppy Drunk' to hear the tight band and the great melodic playing of Little Walter."
1,great player for about 9 months....,"I was very satisfied with the product in the beginning. I could burn my collection to about 4 CD's, and then I could go wherever I wanted, and be able to call up any song I wanted. I was especially impressed with the T-Digit function...That was 9 months ago. Things have since grown progressively worse. Now, I find that it doesn't play MP3 CD's anymore...It only plays Audio CD's now. I tried to contact the D-Link support people, and got a prompt, but unfruitful response. They told me to return it to them, and to do so by contacting the RMA department...so i cantacted the RMA department, and recieved no response...It's been over a week, and still no response! So much for customer satisfaction...If they had created a descent product, I wouldn't be dissatisfied, and I would be writing this review with a seriously different tone..."
3,Average MP3-CD Player,"I got the D-Link DMP-CD100 CD juss a couple of days ago, and it turned out kind of below average. The great thing about the CD-Player is that it can play CD's consisting of over 100 MP3's and the price is acceptable. On the negative side, the CD-Player skips a lot, and there is no ESP (electronic skip protection) when playing MP3's. Also, when playing regular CD's, the player skips often even with ESP on. My opinion, if you really are broke, and need a MP3-CD player, this one is for you. But if you really want one with good quality, then don't get this at all..."
2,Bad Copy,"Good movie. Too bad the copy is poor: Frames missing in various places, leaving scenes choppey and hard to follow. Obviously copied from an old print of an old print."
1,Fantastic Film Noir - Horrible Release,"I am not going to write about the movie itself. It's a film noir classic. What I would like to comment on is this absolutely shameful DVD release by Image. They have used one of the worst public domain copies, without a hint of restoration and charge over $20 for this. It's a robbery! The only redeaming quality of this release are great but short documentaries by Eddie Muleer. The best print of Too Late for Tears (aka. Killer Bait) that I have seen so far is included in the terrific 5 Film Noir Killer Classics 6-DVD set (where one entire DVD is entirely devoted to great special features) and it costs less than this turkey."
5,Farberware Millinium Stainless Copper Clad Cookware set,The WIFE FINALLY LOVES TO COOK!!! The food browns beautifully. Food cooks even and fast. Cleans up easily. Great product!!!
3,Sound Great but lack longevity,I thought that I would try these strings and they sound great for a week of regular play but they do not last as long as the strings I normally use which are EXP17s by D'Addario.
4,The silver sword,"The book is Silver Sword. My favourite bit is when they found Ludwig, when they went to Mr Wolffe. The sad bit I think when Jan lost the box in the river when he was saving Edek, Bronia,and Ruth. He said what was in it I liked it when they got re-united and Jan asked Magrit to be his mum."
3,Use it as school book,This book was exciting at some stages and I quite like it. I recommend you to read this book. Joseph Balicki was the three childrens father and was a school teacher. The Germans took over Poland and wanted everyone to speak German. Joseph kept teaching in Polish so he was jailed in Germany. The children were separated as Poland was bombed. The children survived many years of hard times whilst looking for their parents. Edek smuggled food to survive and was caught taking butter and brought to Germany to slave. This is the begining summary so you may read the rest! I hope you like the story.
