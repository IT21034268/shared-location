5,Great Classic Book,"My 3 year old son loves this book. When we go for a walk around the neighborhood, he wants to pretend that we are going on a ""bear hunt"" and we recite the book. Great book for imagination."
4,Aspiring Teacher Comments,"Michael Rosen's ""We're Going On A Bear Hunt"" is a cute tale suitable for any beginning reader or elementary level class. It has a repetitive and rhythmic verse. The story is a light-hearted adventure, with a fun twist at the conclusion for childrens enjoyment. The illustrations suited the text well, as they were not eccentric but not dull. I used the book for a lesson on sequencing for a first grade class. It can also be used to foster reading skills because of it's textual predictability and repetition. Overall, a helpful tool for fun activities and learning in the classroom."
1,DVD won't play; it has a regional code blocking it.,"I ordered this book with DVD, because I wanted to play the movie for thestudents I work with. Well, the DVD will not play in my VCR. I live in the United States and apparently the DVD has a regional code that will not allow it to be played on my VCR. The message that came on my TV when I put the DVD in my player was this: 1. This disc can not be played. 2. Please check the regional code for this disc.The DVD will play on my computer. It is a cute little movie that stays true to the book, and fun to watch. I would give it a rating of 5 stars if it would play on my VCR. I give the book 5+ stars because it's so fun. The kids love the repetition and acting out the story as I read it."
1,Don't do it!,"I specifically got on-line to find a DVD of ""going on a bear hunt"" because my daughter enjoys the book so much. Imagine our disappointment to find that the DVD will not play in our American equipment. I have tried 3 different DVD players and continually get a message that it is not authorized to play in our region...apparently it is a UK DVD.The seller should list that in the description, but I can't find it anywhere. Of course when I went to the reviews I found that other buyers had the same problem. What a rip off."
2,Oh dear - NOT for beginners,"well, well, well. Teach Yourself? More like : 'If you know the ins and outs of C, you might be able to make a Space Invaders clone'. Wow. He gives no help on other compilers apart from Microsoft C, he writes the book in a 'cool dude! gnarly!!'type way, and I too gave up halfway through chapter 3. If you are a beginner, don't get this book. And consider it if you're okay at C. To tell you the truth, it cost me 36, and put me off C. Now I learn C++ instead. Overall? It's okay if you're good at C, but if you're not, steer clear like the plague."
1,An Inexperienced Book that teaches beginners bad habits.,"I have been programming games both professionally and casually for 3 years now (Dos 32-bit pmode), and I must say that for what LaMothe sets out to do, he falls miserably short. It is forgivable that he codes in 16-bit (which is now obselete and incredibly limited), simply because of the outdated nature of the book itself. All of the systems that he designs and puts forward use video game technologies that the original NES could outdo. His code is static, which is a SERIOUS drawback- any changes or expansions to his games would take an insane amount of code or an entire engine rewrite. The use of C++ is mentioned on the cover and blatantly ignored thereafter. In summary, LaMothe's code, from a professional standpoint, does not convey the fruits reaped from a serious, intelligent, game designer, but more from a monkey that somehow got his hands on a compiler. Please pass the crack pipe."
2,"If you don't know game programming, DON'T get this book","This book overall is written very poorly. Most of the example don't compile, and the one's that do aren't actually explained in detail. He wastes the first couple of chapters talking about nothing, then jumps into some ASM, then goes for the polygon stuff. I guess if you have a VERY GOOD GRASP of C/C++/ASM, then this book might be pretty good, because this book is NOT for the beginning programmer."
2,Shadow of the Thunderbird,"At best this is a poor attempt to emulate Clive Cussler, but with no imagination or attention to detail. As mentioned in other reviews, the continuity needed a lot of work, and the adventures were mundane and lacking in detail. Really!! The native guides were eating McDonalds while the adventurer was eating roots and berries? Really? The adventurer wandered into the back side of the heroine's garden? Really?! It is your time to waste, but I wouldn't even bother."
2,Great story hampered by poor writting,"As some other reviewers have stated, this is a very poorly written book. The author seems to confuse/forget what the characters are doing constantly. It's made for an extremely difficult read. I find myself going every few pages just to make sure I didn't misread what was going on."
2,Simpletech needs better QA,"SimpleTech is not winning points for well designed hardware. This is the 2nd (and last product) I will be buying from them. Although they stand behind their products and have good warrenty support, the best support is when you NEVER need it.I'm on my 2nd warranty replacement drive in one year. The first drive actually held up for about 8 months, and then crashed. The first replacement lasted about 2 weeks. The 2nd replacement started to fail in about a month, but I found that reformatting the drive to NTFS from FAT32 seems to have made it work better.UPDATE - I've had this drive for a year. In that time it has been replaced under warranty twice. Now the drive is failing again."
1,medrlin,"not so goodwhy do you need to add a specific amount of words? less can be better, especially in a review"
4,French misadventures,This book chronicles the French colonial ventures in the Sahara. These exploits were largely perpetrated by Algerian colonial officers according to the author. This book is well written and recommended for those with an interest in French colonial history or in the history of North Africa or the Sahara. More and better quality maps would have greatly enhanced this book.
1,You get what you pay for,"This telescope is not very user friendly. Directions are terrible and not detailed. The CD was nothing more than an advertisement for its' products as well as a rehash of its' simpleton directions. Trying to see a star or anything was a disappointing experience. The construction is also sub-par, as the set screw in the end of the telescope tube, where you put the diagonal viewer stripped out within less than a day and no longer holds the magnifying eyepiece in the tube. It is a plastic threaded hole with a steel screw. Save your money and buy not only a more powerful telescope, but a better constructed one."
1,garbage,After about five minutes of playing the wood handle fell apart not worth the extra money should have just bought a cheaper set
3,"Part great, part bad","I received the order tilmely and well packaged. Set up was relatively easy except for the ""boundry rope"" being hopelessly tangled. The net and poles are strong, sturdy and well designed and are the great part. The racquets are the ""bad part"". The grips came apart after only 2 hours of use. I have glued (they were never glued at manufacture) and taped them back on and thaey are now at least useable but am not sure how long they will last since the material appears to be of poor quality also. For the price, I expected better. However, my biggest concern making the purchace without actually seeing the set was the quality and sturdiness of the net system. It (at least for now ) appears to be excellent !"
2,Good not Great!,"Average quality set, handle wrapping coming apart after only 5 games. It is hard to find a good badminton set now days."
2,Waste of Money!,"I threw a small backyard party and ordered the set. Set up was fast, but the net sags in the middle about 8"" below tournament level. I am not going pro, so I got over it.Racket #1 lost its grip in game 2, then the shaft released from the handle towards the end of the day.Racket #2 lost its shaft the next day.Rackets #3 & #4 are barely holding on after 3 days of minimal adult usage.Now I am searching Amazon for normal quality rackets, which will run $40 a piece minimum.My advise: If you plan to play for over an hour, then buy separate net and rackets of intermediate quality. Otherwise this is a waste of money and you will be buying new rackets within a few days anyway."
3,yeeeah? i'm not sure,"i don't have pun's last album so i can't say if the hardcore pun fans are going to love this or not. they probably have it already. the lyrics are mediocre and the beats are weak, sorry to say. ""it's so hard"" is a great video and a pretty good song, but your money would be far better spent on ditc. whatever, buy both. rip pun."
2,Second time I have been fooled by this author,"This author thinks of great titles that move you to buy his books. But this is the last time I purchase one of McNiff's books. I am not fooled anymore by the connection between the promise of the title and the contents.If you want an academically dry discussion of how art ""heals"" then you came to the right place. The author does a good job of writing like he is watching a parade going by without ever marching in it. He is slippery about his work as a therapist because it is obvious he has not been a therapist since the 70s. That is okay. But some direct experience with people would have enlivened this book and taken it out of the totally academic realm.Like one of the reviewers says, if you are looking for how art heals the proverbial soul, you will not find it here. You will find a book good for a classroom of philosophers. No, I did not want an activity or how-to book. I just expected more authenticity."
4,Very Good!,"I really liked Lily's Ghosts, however it mentioned a curse word twice as the title of a play. Also, one of the mini chapters talks about what the woman feels as she's committing suicide. Howvere, it was pretty good and the author had a great twist in the plot at the end."
4,Lily's Ghosts,"Selected as one of the fifteen Florida Sunshine State books for grades 6 through 8, LILY'S GHOSTS is a good read. In no way does the book disappoint as a piece of entertaining reading. It does not have the depth of some better YA fiction, but the writing style is strong.My only problem with this book is the somewhat exhaustive exposition. Like a snowball rolling down a hill, it gathers quite a bit of momentum from Chapter 8 on and makes for quite an adventure. But also like that same snowball, it seems to need a whole lot of pushes to get to that point. Setting, Character and Tone must take over during the expository parts, but I couldn't really get into this book until the snowball started rolling by itself and then it was hard to put down.For those who enjoyed this book, I would heartily recommend HOW TO DISAPPEAR COMPLETELY AND NEVER BE FOUND as a companion piece."
1,Crumble apart,"Instead of capsules like most electrolyte supplements, this product is in the form of tablets. Problem is that the tablets when exposed to moisture will crumble apart. I am an endurance cyclist, I am throwing away over half a bottle of this expensive product because the tablets do not hold over long rides."
5,Ellecrolyte Stamina,Excellent product and prompt delivery. I run around 25 to 30 miles per week and also ride my bike around 60 miles per week (even more when training for triathlons) and this product is the best electrolyte replacement I have ever found.
4,Nice sheath to cover knife when traveling to someone else's kitchen,"I bought an eight inch Victorinox Chefs knife and needed a safe way to transport to other places when I was cooking. So far, so good. Keeps the blade safe and me safe! -"
5,Be safe,I don't want a big old wooden block. So this works nicely to keep my hands safe when reaching in the drawer for it and keeps the blade in great condition. Using with Victorinox 40520 Fibrox 8-Inch Chef's Knife [http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008M5U1C2/]
5,Goof knife protector,This plastic sheath protects when in drawers from dulling and protects you if you grab it and it won't cut you.
2,"Protects the blade well, but leaves marks on the knife.",The BladeSafe keeps theVictorinox 47520 Fibrox 8-Inch Chef's Knifein place perfectly. The problem is that the same black plastic bits that hold the knife in place leave permanent oval marks on the sides of the knife.
5,Perfect for my bread knife,"Bought for my 10 1/4 inch bread knife of same brand, very happy, works great so far."
3,knife case was the wrong size,"The online description of this item did not include the measurement for the blade width - only the length. The picture looked as though it would accommodate the chef's knife I wanted to use it for - however when it came, it was not wide enough for the blade and did not work. I eventually had to use one for a much longer knife in order to get the blade width I needed. The item works fine but did not fit the knife. I should have contacted the seller ahead of time to get that measurement - but I didn't so the knife guard is sitting in a drawer all alone."
4,Works but I rather use butcher block,"The BladSafe works just fine, but it's somewhat bulky and interferes with quick access to the Victorinox Chef's knife, which I use ALL the time."
5,Gift...,I bought this for my daughter who is going to school for culinay but is a bit clumsy. She thought it was funny and I was happy that the knife fit in it very well.
4,Works well with the Victorinox 8in Chefs knife,Fits perfectly for the Victorinox 8in Chefs knife. There are two rubber pads that hold the knife snugly in the guard; they leave some type of imprint on my knife that I have to wash off before using.
3,"Oooh, that's gonna leave a mark.","I use this BladeSafe to shield the blade of my Victorinox slicing knife, which came with a set of knives. I don't cook many roasts, so the slicing knife has little use for me, but it's also too good to get rid of. So I can now keep the slicing knife in a drawer instead of in the block, and have a second chef's knife in the block, which is more useful to me.The BladeSafe is really ideally suited to protecting a chef's knife, not the slicing knife. The slicing knife fits but is not locked in as well as the chef's knife, due to the lack of a heel on the slicing knife. The case locks, but the blade could be pulled out anyway with only minimal effort.And the little rubber gripper thingies inside the BladeSafe leave a mark on the blade. I'm hoping it's not permanent, but it did not wash off.So in summary, this item is best suited to protect a chef's knife (which it does well), but may leave marks on the blade."
2,"Decent, but doesn't fit knives with wider tangs","Has no cutouts for the handle really, so this assumes a very simple tang (base of the knife). Doesn't fit a number of my knives well, requiring a bit of blade to stick out, and won't fit Kai Shun's Ken Onion knives at all (http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=amb_link_353533562_4?ie=UTF8&rh=n%3A289851%2Ck%3AKen%20Onion%2Cp_4%3AShun%2Cp_6%3AATVPDKIKX0DER&pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&pf_rd_s=center-3&pf_rd_r=1D6VN9C0QD82G8KAJ1W8&pf_rd_t=101&pf_rd_p=1271703622&pf_rd_i=13033531) - I'm working on chopping this guard up to fit it."
2,Not your Momma's Etta,This is a compilation of live tracks from a Memphis nightclub early in Etta's career. Kind of raunchy and raucous with a lot of squalling from Etta. Not the more controlled and melodius voice you can hear on her later albums.... well she still is raunchy sometimes and that is why we love her. I couldn't actually listen through the CD in one sitting. Good for a historical perspective I suppose. Let me tell ya about Ooh Pooh Pa Doo.
5,Awesome display!,"This is what it's all about! The opening cuts are smokin'. Etta comes at you, (yeah, it's like being right there!) purring, snarling, wonderful stuff you gotta hear to believe. The band is almost as hot and nasty. It cools off some on the later cuts but it is a splendid example of a true master on top of her game, ROCKIN'the House off its foundations! Haven't heard the additional cuts on this release, but if they are anything like the opening numbers you'll wear it out even faster. Buy. Hold."
1,If I could have returned it.. I would have,"Old content, does not list current or recent stamps... even for the last 10 years or so. Black and white pics of stamps... ok, but not great.... the book is does not have very many pages... not worth the money..."
1,Tarnished,"These earrings were very pretty when I first received them. After I had them about 6 months the knots tarnished. The posts stayed a pretty silver, maybe the description only said the posts are sterling silver."
3,"Come on, It's not that BAD!!!","Well i bought this telescope for myself and the assembling was fine. I found it rather solid..... Though it is difficult to focus on one thing and you ought to have time for it, I still say that this thing isn't that bad. And anyway, beside being educational, you're getting 600x for just $100. I say, this things worth buying."
1,edu science reflector telescope,"The tripod is not steady enough to be able to follow the planets because the tracking system is difficult to use without disturbing the view. I could use the 9mm eyepice to get 800/9 = 88 magnification but it I could not get a clear focused image of Mars (7 Sept 2005). I am a 43 year old engineer, I will have to try a better telescope."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY,"Kids were excited to buy this telescope so that they could view Mars. The telescope tripod is very shoddy, and after trying to adjust and re-focus the lenses you still could not see anything. EDU Science customer service does not pick up the phone and tells you to call during business hours no matter what time you call. Save yourself the time and aggravation, don't buy this piece of junk."
2,unstable,"Constantly wandered off target,slightest adjustment to focus changes everything,very cheaply made,you get what you pay for,pass this one up try an Orion or something,your money will be better spent."
2,too old,"I bought this book one month ago from Amazon. Although the newest version, I think it is too old for today's interview. The questions in my interviews are not similar as those in the book and much harder. Actually, I don't expect to get answers from the book, only try to make myself less nervous if I have some idea what the question will look like, however, this book doesn't do the job."
5,amazing book,"An amazing book. I have been on quite a few interviews andthis book has helped me tremendously. Sometimes the questions I had on the interviews were EXACTLY the same or variations of questions discussed in the book. Also, the equity derivatives section is of tremendous value in that it gives a perspective on equity derivatives not talked in the many derivatives books out there. I hightly recommend the book."
5,very pleased,"Fast delivery - For soft case very nice quality. I am 5' 100 lbs - easy to carry, load in vehicle or wheel through airport/parking lot/ escalators etc. Locks are cheesy - but I picked up a TSA aproved lock for the shoe compartment and had no problems. I use a cart bag - fix easily. I would recommend - great product for the money."
1,"Cheap, Nasty construction !","After using the bag once, the seam at the top, just under the pull handle started to come apart. Two weeks later it was split wide open and totally useless. I used to have a bag from ""Tour Collection"" that was awesome. Now I've bought a bag from A99 that is made far better and was $12 cheaper !!!"
1,great disappointment,This item was NOT what I expected!!!It could NOT serve the purpose of travelling overseas with golf clubs. I did NOT return it because I could NOT find the paperwork. It is sitting in my closet still in its box unused! I was able to obtain a hardcased travel bag at a local Marshall's outlet at 50% more.
2,Feelin' so bad,"This Cd track list are 1. Radio edit 2. Album edit 3. Waiting For Tonight (Hex's momentous Radio Mix). If you are fan of Jennifer , don't you have all these songs already? The only reason I gave this Cd 2 stars , because the Art work is good. That's all."
4,"Used, but suitable","I wanted to start reading more books about other cultures, especially food cultures. This book was great for what I wanted, and the price was very reasonable! I'm so glad that Amazon has such a wide variety of sellers and used books. Happe Holidays to myself! :)"
3,Fun Pool Volleyball set,"This product is a good backyard pool toy. After cutting the net to fit the width of the pool, cutting slits in the pole tops to tie it to the base, and laying half a patio stone on the base to weight it down, it worked great. Lots of hours playing with the adult kids."
3,Fun,"When it is set up it is a blast!! It just sucks that the net gets tangled so easily, It is so frustrating to sit there for 30 plus minutes trying to untangle the mess so if you buy this make sure to put the net away neatly every time."
2,Novice Challenges,"I am a novice photographer, so take this with a grain of salt... I just bought this kit and it included no instructions and lots of components. I suppose if you are accustomed to using these kits, putting them together must seem self-explanatory. If you are new to these kits you will find it frustrating. It is also frustrating to discover Smith Victor does not have a support site (just references on photography). They do not even provide a support # or address. Keep all this in mind when considering something from this company."
2,Too much detail.. not enough story,"After reading so many chick books, I was really expecting something really good out of Carole Matthews, unfortunately I didn't. I thought she put way too much detail into everything, which seemed to drag everything too much. I got bored of all the detail, ad it didn't seem like she was focused on the story. There were no twist to this story it was just plain. I wouldn't recommend this book, and not to mention the last page was the worst.. Bad ending, bad book, period."
3,Keep it real on Platform 8,"First of all, let me just say that this book has so much potential. Topics of true love and infidelity are sources for wonderful drama and plot twists, but Matthews' venture into the above themes falls a bit short.Teri Carter trips and falls on the train platform, and yes, her dream man saves her. Of course, her dream man (Jamie) is also someone else's dream man, and Teri is crushed. This doesn't stop her from pursuing the affair and kicking her best friend (who left her cheating husband) out of her house. I found it difficult to really empathize with either character, as much of the dialogue is trite and seems forced at times. The story's ending is equally simplistic and leaves the reader hanging as to the future of the star-crossed lovers' relationship.This makes for a fast Sunday afternoon read, but there are other Red Dress Ink titles that are far more interesting and captivating. Leave this one on the platform after reading."
3,Try other Matthews novels instead!,"While I enjoyed this book, I LOVED several others by her--A Minor Indiscretion, The Sweetest Taboo, For Better For Worse and Bare Necessity!This isn't a don't-read, but just take it with a grain of salt--this one isn't nearly as much of a page-turner as the others."
5,Exquisite Music,"Since I received Spa Goddess CD, I have played the CD each morning as I get up and at night when I go to sleep. It has been a gentle transition to and from the daily grind. The music is very exotic, some tracks sound tropical, some are Eastern, while others sound other worldly. This CD is exquisite!"
5,A Trip Back in Time,"Those of us old enough to remember when the passenger train was still the best way to travel and airlines were a luxury, will enjoy Ralph Sharon's music. It is timeless, but takes me back to when there were ""piano bars"" and you wore a coat and tie on a date. Ralph Sharon is (or was) the musical director for Tony Bennett, but he stands alone nicely with the trio of bass and drums. This album is classic piano bar and I recommend it highly for today or a trip back in time."
2,Eden the Vampire Slayer,This story is about a Slayer and her Watcher Guardian (think Watcher). They are connected together through a prophecy and also have to deal with a Master Vampire who is attempting to bind Eden the Slayer to him. The book is reminiscent of Buffy the Vampire Slayer. Eden was orphaned by a vampire in an attempt to get her out of the way and her guardian Elliot reads like a poorly written Giles (right down to being a `Stuffy Brit'). Eden does not have a spidey sense but she does have the ability to smell evil which had a couple of amusing scenes when she came across some good vampires. Some of the descriptions of the sexual encounters were similar to LK Hamilton's in the fact that they were ludicrous ie `it raged through her like a lioness during a hunt.' I kind of found the fact that vampire blood + Absinthe = zombie like slave (aka a Reinfield) amusing.
3,Hit and miss,"A couple of the movies are quite good. The downfall is the poor sound quality. They are still watchable though, so I recommend them. Classic films."
3,A Sacred Story,"This book is a gift from a dear friend and has already given me a wonderful belly laugh! In a litany of things needing to die and things needing to be born, Conlon pointed out that ""Your right brain needs to be born and your left brain needs to be happy about it."" Oh how true! Well, for me at least.This is a wonderful resource for meditation and introspection. Exploring our own humanness is sometimes difficult and painful. Conlon eases us into the hard work with beautiful words and meaningful insight. Through use of examples from his own life experiences, Conlon brings us into focus with our own world."
5,Excellent Bible Commentary Author,"I just finished reading the Book ""Genesis: Beginning & Blessing"" by R. Kent Huges. I have always been told that the key to understanding the entire Bible is based upon a solid knowledge of Genesis. I now understand why! R. Kent Huges writes Biblical commentary is a clear and consise manner, and makes the book of Genesis come to life. The characters, their purposes, and the detailed historical background reveals much about human nature and, more importantly, about the nature of God. I am so delighted by R. Kent Huges' ability to write in a straightforward and unambiguous manner that I will continue to add his many other commentaries to my Christian bookshelf."
1,Neither true or complete.,"This is the worst 'true crime' book on the market. This is so bad that one can only finish if they make a game out of it such as -Count the Mistakes. Do not waste your time or money. Someone please write an acurate book on McGurn, it really would be a great book topic if done properly."
4,Good cargo liner,"Fits my 2007 Nissan Murano perfectly. I would have liked if the sides were a bit higher, which is why I took one star off (they're only about an inch high and the photo made me think they'd be two or three inches high). All in all, a good product. Stands up well to dogs, sand bags, 32 boxes of laminate flooring, and loads of groceries. Soft, flexible, and light but durable."
1,less then 1 star!,"I had a look at this book today while sitting at my local bookshop. I almost spilled my coffee when I noticed what this book was - 30% of the information are taken from Leah Gordon's ""The Book of Vodou"", 65% are taken from the webpages of a woman called Mambo Racine (who will sell initiation into Vodou to anyone who has the right amount of money) and the remaining 5% of the book are taken from cheap Hollywood movies. I am a practitioner of Vodou and Media Asiento en Santeria. This book is a cheap rip-off! I just can't believe that some people recommand this book as ""Fundamental Basics""!"
1,upset,"I bought this for my cousin, for last Christmas. He is a big hunter, and when he opened it the mask was WAYYYY to big for his head. ruined Christmas gift for the youngin'."
2,Not as Pictured. False Advertising,"Although the print on the fabric is of adequate quality, the very see through mesh style fabric it is printed on is less than comfortable, it has a smell radiating off the product that is stomach turning and there is not a dark/black mesh covering the eyes and mouth as pictured. The only reason I chose this item over the others was for that reason. I wanted a product that would conceal the eyes and mouth while hunting. I am very dissatisfied with the product for false advertising its merchandise. If hunting, you are better off purchasing a Camouflage Ski mask, then when the animals see your eyes you'll at least be far more comfortable without the bad smell scaring them off."
3,Good,"For normal spring or summer days, it gets waay to hot to wear. Also, the mouth hole and eye holes are waaay to big and make to mask alot less effective, but it still fufills its basic function i guess."
3,Primos Ninja Cotton Full-Hood Face Mask - Mossy Oak New Break-Up,It does what it appose to do being that it is at the price that I bought it at .
1,Light weight fabric and not as described,"I purchased this item based on it being a NINJA face mask, the pic shows what appears to be black out fabric on eye and mouth holes. But when I received this item there is no black out fabric over eye or mouth holes as shown it description pic. I wanted a face mask which hides my eyes and mouth so keen eyed animals will not see the shiny whites of my eyes and mouth. In addition this is a very light weight fabric (cheap feeling and looking) and almost to big of a mask to wear very bulky and not easy to see out of since it does not fit snug on your head. VERY DISAPPOINTED IN THIS ITEM. DO NOT RECOMMEND"
4,Camping fun!,Gave this to my four year old Grandson for Christmas and he loves it. He likes to go camping so this is the perfect toy for him to play with over the winter until he can go camping for real. Everything looks realistic and I know he will get lots of enjoyment from it.
1,How do you rate this toy overall,My 3-year-old grandson was very disappointed with this product so I would not recommend purchasing it. He is a creative little guy who loves the outdoors and camping but this set just did not interest him at tall.
1,JUNK!,"We got this for my daughter's 3rd birthday. She absolutely loves camping. The stove was broken in one day. My dad ended up taking the whole thing apart and rewiring it. The very next day the lantern stopped working. Yes, we changed the batteries- no luck. He hasn't had the time to tear it apart but I imagine it will be the same issue. I would not recommend this product! It's cute but it's worth about $5- $10 at the most."
3,"And now, for the suspense...","I read this series up to the eighth book (which, try though I might, I could not persuade myself to sit down and finish). This one is the most suspenseful of them all, although it isn't what I'd call nail-biting! It kept my interest, though, and it was different. If you're after heart-pounding drama, you won't find it in this series, but you will find some interesting ""food for thought"" and some likable characters. Give them a try, especially if you're a Phillips/Pella fan and you don't mind first person perspective in a 200+ -page story (yeah, that was a small sigh there)!"
2,I don't like them as much as the old ones,"I guess they've change the formula for the ink, because it feels and looks more like ballpoint ink than the old Uniballs did. The ink is more gummy, and there are always gaps -- not the nice, fluid, clean lines from before. I'll guess I'll have to find something else."
4,Great Decals a Little Repetitive Design,"These are great for my kid's room. There are a lot of stickers and the price is right! However, the horses are repeated quite a bit which made it hard to decorate without using the exact same horse decals next to each other."
1,Probably the worst Little Walter recording ever issued,"I'm a harp player and I love Little Walter, so it pains me to say this, but this album is probably the worst record ever issued with LW on it. The macho banter, fun at first, quickly becomes tiresome as every song has these guys interrupting each other. Someone should have told Bo to tune his guitar. Walter's playing is the best thing about this record, but the ""arrangements"" don't allow him to shine. Maybe I wasn't in the right frame of mind when I listened to this; perhaps drinking a fifth of bourbon first would have made it sound better. If you just got to have every single thing LW ever recorded, well, buy it, try to listen to it, then stick it on the shelf. If you're new to LW and looking for something representative of this man's genius, buy any one of the ""Best of"" Chess collections."
1,Blew it completly,"Iam normally a fan of Vidna Obmana especially with Steve Roach. This Cd is a big disapointment. It is incoherent, and actually grating to the nerves to the point that I was skipping tracks..there are several OK tracks, but most are nothing more than processed noise.. Dont waste your money on this one."
1,Doesn't Fit a Benchmark Steel Door,"I slid off my old sweep. Cleaned off the metal track & lubricated it a little so the new on would ""slide on"" as the seller describes. Wish it had been that easy. It kept getting stuck as this sweep was manufactured just a little too narrow . Not quite 1 3/4 inches. It keep getting stuck & peeling inside where it should have just slid onto the metal door track. Waste of money. I will just have to place something at the door bottom to prevent drafts from coming in. Seems nobody makes anything to fit a Benchmark Steel Door properly."
5,the scars never go away,"Richard Christian Matheson makes words count. In DYSTOPIA, even for the third time reading most of them, they still have power. They are mordant, humane, sad, horrific. Red is justifiably one of his finest stories. Reading it again, I see art work of such dexterity and timing and peeling back the label one step at a time. It should be taught in high schools and colleges. For the sheer construction of it, and most especially the ache we feel for this sad person and what happens. The fun of Canceled, Shutterbugs, The Screaming Man, Where There's a Will, and most especially the beauty, the touching of the heart in the last story. I hope anyone who has lost someone close,will read Who's You in America. You will want to say a from the heart thanks. He is extremely good. Extremely.Thanks."
2,Caillou doll and bath book?,"I purchased this item for my 18 month old. She loves the doll, but is much too old for the ""bath"" book. The book is very disappointing. It is 8 pages with a total of 11 words of a ""story."" What a waste. We don't read in the bathtub and the story has nothing to do with it either, other than being plastic."
5,Great Pad for The Feet,"This is a great pad for practicing your feet in that it is obviously much quieter than a bass drum, so your practice time can increase dramatically.You can work on your feet alone on this pad, or accompany it with a pad for the hands, and get both a great hands/feet and coordination workout (focusing on alignment (unison) and/or linear, etc.)."
5,Great book!,"This book is genius! You will not get through this book without laughing out loud and going ""OMG, I do that!!!"" You will find by the end of the book that maybe you are not so weird after all. Or maybe you are! But, you will also discover that every single person on the face of this Earth, no matter what age, gender, race, or anything else - we all have quirks, and not-a-one of us are normal!"
2,Strong advice,"Absolutely would not recommend this book to a new mother. Very strong and rigid in their ideals. If you're not breastfeeding or are not able too, the author makes a new mother feel like a failure or something's wrong with her for not wanting too to begin with. Also has strong feelings about sharing a bed with your child, among other things, that if you do not feel you want to do, again only a good parent would!?? Think twice and read up on this book before giving it for a gift, or reading as a new mother."
5,Perfect!,"Love the way it is put in small sections, so my family can read everyday, even if just a little."
4,Very good introduction for beginners,"Some people recommend Lee Strobel's writings ('A case for...' series) for beginners and people new to Christian apologetics. However, though Strobel is good, I recommend Dan Story. While Lee lines up experts to lay out his case, Dan has gone through all the information and lays it out in a very easy and concise presentation."
4,I learned a lot of new things about my home state,I really enjoyed reading all about the Dakotas. I plan on traveling to learn more about my roots. This book will really help me plan my travels.
3,Possible ancestry for me,"I have only read bits and pieces of this book, and it looks like to me American history is being re-written. I have two lines on my mother's side of the family that claimed ""Black Dutch"" ancestry, and coincidentally, we've been unable to trace back further than the early to mid 1800's on them. I inherited the olive skin, the ""bump"" on the back of my skull from those lines. They came from Tennessee originally, somewhere in the eastern sector I believe. I really think I might have mainly a mixture of Scotch-Irish and Cherokee ancestry on those sides altogether, as records on them weren't kept as they were with the more prominent English, German, and Hugenot settlers I descend from. I don't remember reading any surnames Kyle, Davis, Grimes, or Fowler on them, but then again you never know"
1,As much fun as it looks,"This cute towel is kid-sized (kids won't trip over it) and fun. With the hood over your head and your hands in the corners of the towel, you can be Spiderman instantly, especially from behind. My grandson loved it, and it even fit me! He can't wait to show it off at the pool."
1,movie review,Well:I have never seen such a bad movie in my life. It is sin to even watch this movie. The concept of the movie is such a disgusting one that the good acting and the freshness of the actress is spoiled. It looks like that Amitabh Bachchan raped her career for the sake of looking young for himself. Even ramgopal verma's good direction was helpless to restrict the interference of Amitabh in the movie script. He played with the movie. He is playing wrong practice in the present scenario. He is just taking advantage of his position and money. It is appearing a devil's work at his age. I recommend nobody should watch this movie except those frustrated old people who still do not feel their responsibility towards the society.
5,well built cover,"the cover came on time. it was in a nice box that protected it well. the installation with the allen wrench was easy. only thing is that i installed at night when it was about 45 degrees out, which made it more difficult to stretch the cover over the edges, but i expected this b/c i had an old cover with the same issue."
5,Great Shovel helps protect your back,With all the snow fall this year especially in January which set a record for snow fall nearly 7 feet. This shovel performed very well.
1,The worst shovel I've ever used,"I orignally bought this for my parents last winter because all local stores were sold out due to frequent snow storms.The moment I held it in my hand, I realized I had made a big mistake. It was flimsy and the balance was really off. But since my parents really needed a shovel, I gave them my used one and kept the new one as mine since I have a small area to shovel.During the next snow storm, I got a chance to try out the new shovel. Within 30 seconds, my back was hurting: there's nothing ergonomic about this shovel -- having a bend in the shaft doesn't make it ergonomic. I've used many shovels -- snow or otherwise -- over the years and this is the worst shovel I've ever used.Stay away at all cost; it's not worth it. Buy one locally before the next winter is in full swing."
3,"OK, but not technical enough","I have been model building for over 20 years, but only last year did I start painting figures. Most of my models had no figures or were done uninspired with acrylics. I finally decided to use oils and this book helped a lot with techniques for shading and highlighting. It's shortcoming was that they just said mix a base fleshtone, and add this color or that. I would really have liked ratios such as 4 parts raw umber, 1 part yellow ochre, etc. If it wasn't for my years of experience, I might have been been upset about this. Model building is a lot of trial and error and I had the patience to persevere, but a lot of paint was lost in these experiments. I can't say this is for someone with little experience but for model builders who can see a color and know what mix they need, it shouldn't be too much of a challenge."
3,The System-What's the mix?,"The book overall was good. The only flaw is when it tells the oils to use but it doesn't tell the mix for the first step. It shows the oils layed out and has them labeld but in the text it doesn't tell what all of them are. Some you can go by the color but for the first step it just says mixture A, but it doesn't say what mixture A is. It could have used a few more step by step photos in the beginning also."
4,Nice bit,"This is a nice bit. The price is pretty good. Solid, sharp, and still going. There really isn't too much to review. Typically, these bits are well over priced if you find them locally, that is why I went with Amazon."
1,Karaoke performed in the style of Abba review,"I thought the product was misrepresented. It said----Karaoke--and there were NO WORDS included. You were told to find them in various books. Therefore, this should NOT be sold as karaoke!!!!"
2,disappointed,"I just couldn't get past the first pages, but I tried to keep reading waiting for the book to either make some sort of sense or get the the actual point, or even get better. I got to chapter 4 and couldn't do it any more. The stories were very short I mean like a page or a half a page short. I've read a few other books on how horses help people and I loved them! the grabbed me right from the first page and I couldn't put the book down.. unfortunately with this book I had to put it down, it put me to sleep!"
3,A Few Good Points,The book has a few good points to keep in mind. Although it certainly helps to have enough money to live in NYC where enough interesting things are happening to keep one interested in life. Most of us don't have the requisite quantity of money to do such things.
4,An okay snowboarding book,"I thought this book was okay. It had plenty of snowboarding, but there was too much competition between the two brothers. I really liked though when they finally realized that they have to watch out for one another."
5,This book is priceless!,"I really enjoyed this one and more than any other Elizabeth Beverly book this one hooked me totally and [...]in. The characters were great (except the mother who drove me up a wall!) and the hero Adam was so HOT! This is a funny, clever read that will definitely satisfy romance fans."
3,"A great sink, but VERY deep if undermounted","This sink is very deep, and when undermounted, it is even deeper. We thought we wanted deep sinks, but it reduces the amount of usable space in the cupboards under the sink. It's a high quality product--just be sure you know what you're getting, and how much space it will occupy (especially when you add the plumbing below it)."
4,Small Personal cutting board.,"This is a nice looking personal cutting board. Its defiantly small, but I have a penchant for the german made knives wusthof is so famous for. The wood is easier on knife edges than plastic or glass, and I love the way my blades look on standby lying on this board.If you own wusthof knives do yourself a favor and pick up this board while its still only 10 bucks."
4,Bamboo Cutting Board,"The quality of this cutting board is very good. The size is perfect for chopping vegetables and fruits. The only negative, would be the fact that there are feet on the underside of the board. I would far prefer a board that can be flipped over and utilized on both sides!"
2,shocked and saddened,"I was very surprised at this item, for 30.00 I expected a cookware set that was a smaller version of my own. What we got was a minature version that even my 4 year old said was tiny. The pans were flimsey and the hat was corney. Never would I have paid that much money for something so cheap and poorly presented. I think it's worth maybe 5-7 dollars and that's generous."
1,wrong image of Islam,"I was wondering that the people as you have mention in the book, they don't blame the ""islamic teachings"" for the wraths, they blame the people. Because Islam itself never allows people to do any injustice. People are viewing a completely wrong image of Islam through these books. It's only one side of the religion."
3,Maxtors crash? I don't think so.,"I've been hearing the ""urban legend"" for years about Maxtors, but I've used a bunch of them, and have never had one crash. I'd like to know if the poster above actually experienced a Maxtor crash, or is just regurgitating a rumor."
4,I approve,"Not too much to say, really.It does what it needs to, and comes with its own little travel bag (complete with instructions and two cables for the USB port). I had no problems with it.The fan is a little noisy, but easy to tune out. I only noticed it by its absence after I unplugged it, actually. It also gets a bit warm, so for caution's sake, I'd recommend not sticking it somewhere where it can't get airflow. The plug part that goes into the cigarette lighter is thick enough that when you plug it in, it take some effort, and won't go anywhere after that. That being said, you still probably don't want to put it somewhere where it could easily get hit and loosen in the socket. It seems solidly constructed, and didn't do anything to my car or electronics that I plugged in, so I conclude that it is exactly what I was looking for. Well, plus a few other outlets that I didn't really need, but appreciate having handy."
1,Changed the formula,"If you used this salve when you were a young you will be disappointed as I was. Someone is using the brand name to make a lot of money. The original Sayman Salve had these ingredients on the jar. Contains Camphor, Zinc Oxide, Boric Acid, Lanolin and Petrolatum. This new formula does not contain Camphor or the Boric Acid which made it have that soothing warm feeling on irritated skin. Why they changed the formula is anybody's guess. That's what made the product! I would not waste my money on this product and especially what they charge for it."
5,The Real Deal,"I don't even like rap very much, but I have a friend who made me listen to Pimpadelic, and I know this is the real deal. If you liked Lynyrd Skynyrd when you were a kid, you will like this. And there's something oddly compelling about the whole Pimpadelic concept. This is going to be very big, so get it now and you can brag to everyone later on how you ""discovered"" Pimpadelic. Also they're excellent live -- I saw them last night and they rocked despite being an opening act with a half-empty house. Had a beer with them afterward, too, and found them very friendly."
3,Would have been great if one of the bags didn't open,The product is good but one three of the bags were some how opened and got the mix everywhere once we open the box. Good product though....
4,Carrara Bible,This is a great book for PC owners with Carrara software. It is well written and easy to follow. The content is easy to use for tutorial learning as well as a topical reference.
4,Good Book for Beginners,"There aren't many Carrara books around. In fact, I know of only another book (Carrara for Dummies) by the same author. This is definite better.What is good about this book? For a start, if you are frustrated with the manual that comes with the software, this is a good replacement. It contains more accurate information and useful, easy-to-understand instructions to follow which gets the beginner to learning in no time.But if are not a beginner and have dabbled with the software well, then this is not for you. Many concepts are common to those in the manual just that this book illustrates the concepts better with more accurate details.Would have given five stars if there were more goodies on the CD-ROM. This is a good Carrara total beginner's book... can really learn from this book !!"
1,not your normal chick lit,"If your looking for the predicting, romatic chick lit book Red Dress Ink is giving us a normal bases then this book isn't for you. In many ways it had no point and it left me wondering where my 4 days went. It had annoying characters that had major issues. Like someone said before, this isn't a character that you can look up to."
1,Bored by KathieMe,"Listening to this cathartic diary of hers was nauseating. The title song has got to be the most putrid ""love song"" ever. She's an embarrassment to songwriting and vocalists everywhere. ""Moon Dance"" was an abomination, we all know J. Morrison is rolling I hope his estate gets everything it can from this one. They actually should SUE her."
1,Born for You...not born for airplay....,"This CD is not something I think is gonna fly with today music buying audience... sure people who watch her on TV will buy it but the average music listenerwho is'nt part of her ""built in audience"" i doubt it. Nothing really stands out and at times she sounds as if she's doing a Shania Twain vocal thing with a couple of the songs...Universal is going to have a hard sell with this CD and i think they should concentrate on breaking NEW bands not established TV personalities."
2,Needs Work,"This album needs a little work - vocals are very weak and too breathy. I know the sound she was trying for - but not sure that it was actually achieved. With some training - she could possible be a fine vocalist with work on pitch and tone, as well as obtaining a defined style. As I listened to the different selections available for review - It became more and more difficult to tell them apart. I am sure some individuals will like this type of performance - I don't see any of them hitting the charts - but who knows - we can all be wrong."
1,Sign of the Apocalypse,"What can be said about this album but that it's an enormouswaste of time and digital bytes. Why would any self-respecting personlisten, let alone buy, this CD? No one who loves humanity can like this CD. Kathie-Lee simply continues to torture the world with her less than talented voice and music. There isn't a single piece of emotion in this CD except Kathie-Lee's exuberance that someone actually bought into this self-absorbed tripe. Her continued pandering of every aspect of her life is loathsome to say the least. The fact that the songs on this album were 'inspired' by her husband's infidelity and the aftermath just makes me think of how much this album is like a pelvic exam. Kathie-Lee, no one needs to hear this album."
3,cali tarocco orange moisturizing shampoo,I like the soap better. I found not much lather with the shampoo. I think it smells nice but not enough to recomend
5,It can't get better than this,"The film is simply amazing and so is the soundtrack. A very well cocked mix between French/Belgium music and traditional blues. The kind of record that your friends keep asking ""what is this"" and ""Where did you find-it""."
5,Superb,"The perfect soundtrack to a great animated story. Even if you don't care for the movie the music is perfect for jazz, swing, and beebop lovers. Great beginers introduction to contemporary French Jazz and Swing bands."
4,"Deep, jazzy and bizarre","""The Triplets of Belleville"" is simply the best animated movie I have seen in all my life, deep, weird and full of symbology. This jazzy and charmy soundtrack feets perfectly each scene, each poem and each bizarre mood presented in this fabulous fantasy. I strongly recomend this CD."
2,"Mediocre, at Best",I bought this CD on based on the rave reviews I read herein. I was disappointed to say the least. Tierney has a nice enough voice but her band just doesn't cut it at all. You can find better jazz out there than this offering.
3,Stop before you finish it,"I completed this game and enjoyed the graphics and gameplay feel as I did so. However, the ending was the most horrible abomination ever created. I really don't want to go into detail for fear of reliving it in my mind. Do yourself a favor and stop just before the end... you'll be glad you did."
2,EL INICIO DE UN NUEVO GENERO DEL CINE MEXICANO,"Con esta pelicula se inicia todo un nuevo genero del cine mexicano,que nos presenta con historias simples y sencillas la vida de las ""ficheras"" aderezadas con desnudos totales femeninos y albures,para regocijo del gran publico con escasa cultura.Este cine aunque de escaso valor cinematografico nos ofrece un panorama de la llamada cultura popular mexicana."
1,Waste of money,"I tried one of these, once, it destroyed my lawn. It did remove the thatch, unfortunately it also removed the grass!I would give it zero stars if the system would allow it.If you're looking for a tool to remove your lawn, this is it!"
2,Just a toy ....,"I bought this item as a novelty, still thinking it my be slightly accurate in its assessments. Wrong. It's a toy ... and mostly random in its assessments of your state or stress level. Depending on how hard you press your two fingers on the contacts, and depending on how moist your fingers are ... you'll get varying results."
5,Great Book,"While this book is listed as out-of-print here, it is available directly from the publisher at scalarspublishing.comGreat book and easy to use."
5,Inspirational from Cover to Cover.,"I read TIL THE FAT GIRL SINGS from cover to cover in one sitting - completely enthralled. This isn't just a book about overcoming weight issues. The reoccuring question is - Is this the person I want to be? Miss Wheatley takes you on a journey that is poignant and keeps you turning the pages. This book is an intimate conversation with a hilarious, loveable and strong woman who has alot of wisdom to share. I've already reccommended it to friends male and female, from ages 19-50, within and out of the theater business. You shouldn't pass this one up!"
3,its not all good but ok,ok now the song i really only like that sounds ok is i'll see you in my dreams im just glad i didnt waste my money on this cd so my words to you is D O N T B U Y
3,Daughter Loves It,"my 3 year old got this for her birthday and begged me to put it together right away! It was easy to put together, but the pieces and construction are really cheap and flimsy. It works great for what it's for, but this is not a toy I'm expecting to last forever. It fits larger dolls, which is great, and the rocking cradle is my daughter's favorite part."
4,Great toy!,Bought this for my 1 year old grandson for Christmas! It was packaged great and delivery was very quick. The toy itself was made well and he really liked it at first. I think its one of those toys you need to put away and take out again. He seem to get bored with it. He may be a little young. Hopefully as he grows he will play with it more.But all in all great toy. It was priced a little high but well made. I would recommend for a friend.
2,"""Harpurism""","Tom Harpur turns his back on orthodox Christianity and substitutes a faith which is no more objective,verifiable or rational than the one he has left behind. It's just intellectually dishonest."
4,Loads of fun,"One of the hidden classics, right up there with Harry Shannon's new Night of the Werewolf for imagination and verve. I went on a tear recently with Silver Bullet, The Wild and a bunch of other oldies like Wolfen. This one is fun. If you like furry faced horror track it down."
1,Don't buy,"Bought these batteries to go along with a gift I ordered for my grand daughter on Amazon. After receiving the items, my grand daughter called and told me that the package of batteries had been ripped open and that only 11 batteries were in the pack. Not cool Amazon."
1,Flat cologne,"cologne was flat nowhere near expected smell,I have been using for at least 20 years, more like colored alcohol.I cannot use or repurchase,USELESS!"
4,Be wise like Nietzsche,"If you are interested in understanding Friedrich Nietzche's philosophy this little book is a great place to start. In this book the philosopherwho coined the phrase ""God is dead"" brings us two two other ones in this little book ""What does not kill you makes you stronger"" and ""Do not spit against the wind"". He was the first immoralist who believed that freeing the world from a make believe God and our accountibilty to him was the true way to redemption. He was one of the first antagonists to Christianity and disagreed with Christian morality. He thought guilt was terrible. Buy this book if this sounds interesting. I have always found his writings deep and memorable, he was way ahead of his time in the 19th century. He was truly a great thinker whether you agree with him or not. This book can be read in a little over an hour."
1,"Funnier than Bansky, but unintentionally so","Check out the titles of the three ""chapters"" in this thing; let it dawn on you that he wrote this whole book about HIMSELF; and then see if you can keep yourself from peeing your pants, laughing. (""Gimme a break!"")"
1,Disappointing,"I ordered this for my classroom because we show the movie as part of our curriculum. This is a photo of the original poster - it is NOT an original poster. It is cheap enough, and I decided to keep it because of that. However, I will NOT order from this vendor again."
1,Uses ceramic - easily cracked.,"I sharpened about 5 knives before the ceramic cracked or wore away. Also, it is hard to hold, if the knife grabs it will pull the sharpener over, possibly cutting you. I bought another brand with reversible and replaceable sharpening blades, it's great sharpening and will last forever."
3,the observer,"wusthof 2 stage pocket sharpernervery convenient, easy to use, not the sharpest knives, but satisfactory"
4,"works well, hard to hold","sharpener works well and looks as advertised. No surprises when I poened the box. Travels extremely well due to size, which is main reason for purchase. However, small size makes it a challlenge to hold. The ""gripper"" feet on the bas could have been thicker. Overall, worth the $12 cost."
4,Versatile Earring,"These earrings are pretty and work equally well with casual wear or when I want to dress up a little. The earring is somewhat larger than I expected, but overall, am quite satisfied with this purchase."
5,The greatest voice of the century,"Even if your not a Mario Lanza fan,you will be amazed at this voice when you watch this cd ""great caruso"". Every type of hero is in this number,from the very young, to a loved man who must be in his Live at the Operahouses from arround the world."
2,Disappointing purchase....,"Hello. I made this purchase for an older friend of my Aunt. She was very excited to be receiving this video, for she has memories from her youth of not only this actor, but the times she and her father would watch this movie. I was disappointed to discover this weekend that the video did not play in its entirety. She did not even make it through the entire film before it went black (?). I know this was not a new copy, but we did expect it to at least play. She has such a joy in her heart & eye for this movie, that she is looking to purchase another copy. Prayfully, we have have different results."
3,This Gate is Nothing to Brag about!,This is more like a standard gate. I use it in my baby's doorway to keep our dog out. It is difficult to open to get through the gate. I will replace it with a swing door gate soon! The gate would be better used in a non high traffic area or for tempory use.
3,does its job,"first let me say that i have only used it as a pressure gate so far, and that i am using it for my dogsit does its job well, and the only clear fault with it is that it is quite hard to get the locking mechanism to unlock, its actually so hard it hurts my hand to undo it! also when you go to put it into lock it also takes quite a bit of strength and i am half worried i will break it"
1,Absolute worst gate in existence,"If you take a very close look at the part you must push down on to lock it in place you will see there is a kind of ""T"" shaped piece that is driven into your palm every time you push down on it to lock it. Plus, as you lock it a small piece of your hand gets pinched in the lock - there is no way to avoid it. It is so painful to lock into place that I have taken to leaning things up against it to avoid injury. Babysitters and grandparents refuse to operate the gate meaning they must put the child down, step over the gate, then lift the child again which isn't recommended and rather difficult when you are trying to get a sleeping child to their bed. I only wish I could give the gate -5 stars. [...]"
3,Joe is a Film and Not Just a Book,"""My Name is Joe"" was recommended to me by a Glaswegian work mate. He thought it would be a good follow up to ""Trainspotting"" which I watched a few weeks ago.Although I enjoyed ""Joe"", it is a very different film to ""Trainspotting"". Whereas the latter could sometimes be surreal and blackly comic, ""Joe"" is more a real life gritty drama.Every character is plausible. Joe, himself, as played by Peter Mullan, is a knock about sort of working class bloke who slowly falls in love with a woman, Sarah, as played by Louise Goddall, who is a middle class health worker. Although seemingly from different worlds, they gradually warm to each other. The other character in each of their lives is Liam who is a friend to Joe and a client to Sarah. It is Liam and the threats are made to him that form the basis of the film's plot.See this film for its gritty realism. Be prepared, however, to listen carefully. A Glaswegian accent is often difficult to the untrained ear."
4,"A real find! Inspiring and practical, too","Many screenwriting gurus say ""Everything you need to know about how to write good drama is in Aristotle's Poetics,"" but then they never explain what's actually in that work! I've tried reading Aristotle's original text, but it is really tough going. Tierno's book is a real find - it boils down a rambling, classics text into concise concepts, tips and techniques that I could understand and use. Tierno provides examples of how all this stuff really works in a variety of films, too. This book is not only practical, but pretty inspiring, too. It gets to the ""heart"" and ""roots"" of good drama, something you can forget about when you get bogged down with a script. After reading this, I was excited and motivated to return to my own work."
4,Concise dramatic instruction,"This book is useful for fiction writers as well as screenwriters. The author interprets Aristotle's ideas and suggestions and then renders them with examples into language applicable to modern drama. Many of Aristotle's original ideas are quoted and have timeless power. For example: ""Beginners succeed earlier with Diction and Characters than with the construction of a story.""Tierno relates how the parts of a modern script evaluation (Log Line, Brief, Plot Summary, Comments, Idea, Story, Character, Dialogue, and Production Values) mirror Aristotle's examination of the same elements. I especially liked how the film ""Gladiator"" was used for the example of ""the mistake in a hero's reasoning, leading to the hero's subsequent related misfortunes.""The short length makes the book a fast but powerful read."
4,Easy to Read and Full of Practical Examples,"Finally, a significant hands-on approach to screen writing...something with definition...great examples. Writers take notice! Rise up above the mediocraty and give us substance."
3,Interesting look at modern Amish life,An interesting look at modern day Amish life and how they have evolved to survive in today's economy. I found it somewhat intriguing as to the ways they adapted to continue in this day and age. Just like most denominations they have come up with loopholes to allow them to do some of the things that would have been considered ungodly by their predecessors.
2,Poorly written,"I am a big fan of urban fantasy novels, so I thought the overall concept of this book sounded intriguing. I was very disappointed with the writing in this book. This book reads like a poorly written children's novel. The level of writing is just not appropriate for an adult novel. The font is also quite large, which is weird. The story wasn't bad, but I just couldn't get past the poor writing."
4,Wren steals back what is stolen,"staying dead is the first retrievers novel that I have read, bukt not the last.Wren finds things for people and steals them back.nher skills and magic.her partner Sergel owns are art gallery. But has lots more skills.Its a whole new York with magic,demoms, angel wizzards and humans.Its a action,fantasy and clean book."
1,snooze....,"I got to through to the 3rd chapter and there was NOTHING that held my interest. This book just wouldn't get to the point. It just went on and on and on like that little pink rabbit about nothing. If I wanted a historical account of the Nazi occupation of Guernsey I would have read a history book. Save your money, grab yourself a good Jack Higgens book!"
4,good book but where is the proof reader?,"In short, I enjoyed ""Lying With the Enemy"". It deserves the high regard offered by the other reviewers.What I find most fascinating is the dozens of gramatical errors in this edition. I have never seen a book with so many mistakes.It really takes away from the book when you have to stop and figure out what the author is trying to convey because a sentence does not make sense."
4,War makes for strange bedfellows.,"World War II is raging on all fronts in Europe. The Nazis have set up camp on the tranquil Island of Guernsey off the coast of England. The island people have succumbed to the enemy, and exist to the best of their ability during a time of food rationing, shortages, and at times occupation of their homes. Adaptation is a necessity and the black market is in full gear.Our story revolves around a gruesome murder. The possibilities are endless as the author introduces you to the many characters on the stage he sets. There is much fraternization with the Nazis and many people on the island hold grudges. The story turns into a tangled web of espionage and intrigue that culminates in a satisfying finish.I would rate this book a 3.5 if I had that option. In the reading of it I found some chapters to be fragmented and disjointed making for a loss of that smooth transition I enjoy when an author writes from the perspective of many different characters.

5,yu-gi-oh,"I thank educational for the little ones like 9 or 10.I love this game. I have be playing it for a long time.I have buyed all of the starter decks. I have all 3 blue eyes,dark magician,red eyes b. dragon,Relinquished.I love this game..........YU-GI-OH RULES"
5,By Adam,"This toy is very fun and is adored by kids of all ages. Therefore, 5 stars. To the parents, you may not think this toy is educational at all. This is true in some ways, your child will not learn math or science by playing the game, however, your child will be able to learn strategy. After all, stratagy is what this game is all about. The durability of this depends on the way you shuffle. Kids, if you don't know what I'm talking about, go ask an adult. They'll know. If you use the patented bridge shuffle, your cards will last longer. If you use the deck shuffle, your cards will tear in two.However your kids will love this game and it will keep them occupied. They are a little expensive though.Almost every Saturday in Stroudsburg PA, they will have Yu-Gi-Oh! card conventions. Your children will have fun dueling and trading cards. However, moniter their trades and make sure nobody is taking advantadge of you younger or beginner child by asking someone who is working at the convention."
5,Good deck,"This is a prety good deck but if you dueling someone with a Kiaba deck. And use dragon capture jar, soul exchange, and change of heart before they played their BEWD then your toast.(Not like your gona use dragon capture jar before that)But don't let me discurage you Yugi's deck has great monsters, traps, and magic cards."
5,The NEW Game on the Block,"This game is great. This game is much better than the Pokemon trading card game. In the Pokemon came you rely on your luck and how strong your cards are, but in Yu-Gi-Oh! you rely on much more. The game is surrounded by strategy. If you are facing a monster with a greater power than your own you can still beat it by using magic cards to power up your monster and save your life points; you could also use trap cards to trap your openent and win the round.I recommend you get the Yu-Gi starter deck and the Kaiba starter deck to start off your your deck and get some powerful monster like the Dark Magician, Summoned Skull and the Lengendary Blue Eyes White Dragon. Then you should try your skill against an opponent and build up your rank. And in no time you could be a duelist to be reconed with(Pardon any spelling errors I've made)."
2,Yu-Gi-Oh is a waste of money,"I mean don't get me wrong it's a cool game, but the prices are outrageous, and they don't last long. My brother likes them, but I think it is too confusing and a waste of time and money."
5,Stephens Review,"This a great game you wont want to miss it has cool drawings of the yu-gi-ohs. It is educational because it teaches you something, how to battle with yu-gi-oh cards. It has alot of durability you can take it anywhere with you and as long as you keep it in its case it wont even pick up a scratch. I also think its fun because i like how you battle it even comes with the little sheet you battle on. Its cool because you can send out blue ice white dragon and still make him better by putting in other attachment cards like a card that gives +600 to attack and-400 to deffense but its all good.I rate this game better than that any other of its kind (like pokemon,magic,digimon etc.)So if you want a good battling card game get this one."
4,Not quite the real thing...,"While the actual Yu-gi-oh! card game is extremely enjoyable to play, and this is as well, there is a distinct reason why you get 50 cards for so little cash. The holographic cards (there are three in a starter deck) have alternate animations on them so they don't look like the real thing. Also, there are actually about 10 or 12 rare cards in the starter decks but those are not holographic. This will only take away from a collecter's standpoint, but some people just feel that the real thing is best. The big ups to this are the good cards you get along with the rulebook, but the downside is it doesn't teach you to make your own deck and it's value is diminished because it's not the same. This is still useful and enjoyable, but only for what it is- a Starter deck."
1,Like blotting with wax paper!,"I would not buy these again. They don't absorb anything, and feel like wax paper. I'll stick with the Clean & Clear sheets."
5,Awesome book but not worth more than 10 bucks,I own this book bought it at a local bookstore for 9.99 I would highly recommend it for small gardeners or farmer market buyers for putting up small amounts a little each day. If you're looking for large quantity canning recipes stay to the traditional books. The way my garden has worked out the last cpl years I was able to put up a lot of green beans a cpl pints a day at a time all summer and still have a full pantry by fall. Favorite recipe still is the spicey green bean pickles. I see no reason for the high prices for a new book listed here other than greed.
4,About a British Superstar,"This is an unauthorized biography about one of Britain's greatest stars nowadays. On the back cover of this book he is described as:- the highest paid performer in the music industry.- the winner of more Brit awards than any British pop star.- and in 2003, Robbie Williams broke all records with three storming shows at Knebworth.This is his story as presented by Sean Smith. The author tells us about the singer's background, his immediate family, childhood friend and other people who have met Robbie Williams. I find that the author all in all gives a positive image of the singer. He has also given room to Robbie Williams's horoscope.I found the book to be quite all right and an easy read. I finished it in some very few days."
2,Not what it's promoted to be,"This toy is a great idea, poorly executed. The main problem is that about half of the questions asked by the toy CANNOT be answered by looking on the globe. It's simply too small to include rivers, European capitals, mountain ranges, etc. The toy asks such questions anyway. The sound is also so poor that it is occasionally impossible to understand the question. Finally, the globe has no ""trackball action,"" as advertised. It is merely a globe that rolls around in a frame."
5,Panasonic trimmer,This was a gift my husband had requested and so far so good! I really like the vacuum feature-no mess.
2,Not the best,"Takes a bit of doing to get results, not sure why, maybe the blades. Had one before that worked great until it was dropped."
5,Works very well,This product works very well. Removes ear and nose hair quickly and the vacuum collects the hair.
2,Not an improvement over the ER411,"I dropped my old ER411 a few days ago and it never recovered from that injury, so I decided to give the ER430K a shot. However, I am unable to recommend this model -- it simply didn't work as well as my old workhorse.My main gripe is that the ER430K took repeated poking and prodding to get any hair to come in contact with the blade, and was unable to reach shorter hairs at all. At first, I thought I had failed to remove a packing piece, especially since the ER430K's blade-tip is a rounded plastic nub with blades on either side. But according to the manual, the unit was ready for use with the exception of a battery."
5,Good trimmer,I have used this trimmer twice and I am surprised how good it trims the ear hair. I really like it.
4,Nice Trimmer,"Works mostly well, although hard to get into tiny crevices of the nose with. Overall, does a good job!"
4,Panasonic ER430K Vacuum Nose/Ear Hair Trimmer,The trimmer works well.It doesn't snag and is easy to clean.
3,not as good as my former trimmer,I was not totally satisfied with its performance-it does not clip close enough and it is slow in doing the timming-my old model did a lot better job.
3,Great Until it Broke,"This was the best trimmer I ever stuck up my nose, or in my ear.It cut quick, clean, never pulled. It was faster than any I've used.For about four uses. Then it stopped working entriely. Nothing wouldmake the motor run. Recharged battery, new battery, zip.Had to send it back.Worse, noplace local has them.If they did, if there were a way for me to return them under warranty,even every week, I'd still want it back.Too bad for me.See other reviews. this seems to be a common complaint."
2,Waste of Money,This product is no better than the $10.00 models you can get at your local store. Very disappointed. The real problem is that no manufacturer has yet to make a personal trimmer that actually does a good job. I should have known better than to think this product was the one. Do not waste your money.
4,Great but not perfect,"This trimmer is something I've been looking for but was trepidatious to purchase for fear of the nose hair pulling that has happened in the past. Well, I'm happy to say, none of that is the case with this trimmer. No pulling, tearing or catching at all. It zips along at a rapid pace and cuts the hairs cleanly - for the most part. It cleaned out my nose and ear hairs very effectively with the exception that, sometimes, because of the way the end is designed, you have to go over the same hair a dozen times before they get clipped. Otherwise, it's great. I highly recommend it. In fact, it tickles my nose which makes me laugh. Now that's a nice benefit to having to trim unsightly hairs."
2,almost useless,"The previous Panasonic model that I had for years worked very well, but in this version only the vacuum is working OK. It will take you a lot of time to catch a hair or two. You will be much better off using tweezers or scissors. And what is the deal with the stupid mirror? For the first time in my life I see a mirror that doesn't reflect anything."
4,Great product...will buy again.,The product worked as promised. Will buy it again as a gift for someone. Note: This product doesn't shave the hair but just trims it down to a very acceptable level.Very easy to use. Drains a full charged battery in less than ten minutes. Better start using rechargeable batteries if you mind the expense!
3,Every six months without fail this dies,"Let me say first that I really like this product. It has never nicked me, for example. So, I'm on my 3rd one. It works great for a few months, but then it - slowly - starts to loose strength. Of course, I replace the battery, but that never helps. I've tried both lithium and alkaline batteries. Makes no difference and eventually, it just dies. So, I've learned to always have a spare one on hand. Its covered by warranty, but for what a new one costs, going through the process just isn't worth it."
4,generally good,"First, this is the fourth nose trimmer of this type I have owned. None of them pulled my nose hairs, probably because I used them properly. It takes about ten minutes of use to get rid of all hairs. First you glide it on the interior surface of each nostril pushing it up and down and rotating it about ten degrees nine times. Then you use your index finger to press the tip of your nose towards your face. This changes the shape of your nostrils. You then angle the device about 20 degrees with respect to the vertical and do the above mentioned ritual. Then angel the trimmer 45 degrees to the vertical and to it all again.Then you check the results. Insert your thumb in each nostril and put your index finger on the outside of the nose. Press them together and pull them towards the opening. This will reveal hairs that are still too long.If you have not yet died of boredom, repeat all of the above ritual but just in the are of the newly discovered long hairs."
3,"Ok, but not great","I bought it in 2009, very light use. First thing, the included case is of very poor quality, attracts a ton of dust, and is not quite fitted for the product's shape.Second, it worked well I guess for a couple of years of very light use, but recently I have been noticing the speed of the motor is varying while in use - it speeds up and then slows down - sounds like it is ""dying"" - I've replaced the battery, but have detected no change. I feel it is rotating a bit slow mostly compared to when it was new. I probably need to buy a replacement pretty soon. Good thing the price has come down a bit.On final note, the idea is quite good - it worked well when it was new, not perfect, but alas, the quality is a let down."
1,Doesn't work after a month of use,"It worked fine for the first month. But then suddenly it died. I used the trimmer probably once (or twice, rarely) a week. Not worth the money."
3,"Cute, enjoyable for the very young","The illustrations are wonderful... bright and colorful enough to grab all children. The idea of the story (picky eater) is definitely an issue that children can understand, as well as parents. The story is clever, but some of the writing leaves a little to be desired. The phrases ""...said Max's sister, Ruby"", ""said Ruby"" is said seven times in the storybook... there are only ten pages... and ""said Max"" is written three times. Those phrases are always the ones that distract my child away from the story... and this one was no exception."
5,My daughter's favorite,My 2yr old loves these books. The board books are great because they are short enough you don't mind reading several.
2,A pain to read,"The pictures in this book are wonderful, but I can't say my baby loves the book and more than anything else, it is hard (and uninteresting) for an adult to read out loud. This is because it consists almost exclusively of rather dull reported speach: ""Eat your egg Max"" said Max's sister Ruby"" seems innocuous in print, but try reading it out loud a few times."
5,Very nice mirror!,"With this mirror, I can see to pluck my eyebrows. Otherwise, can't even see to put on mascara. The light is bright, just right to see detail. Shipping was fast, would deal again."
1,Disappointed Dad,"I really had high hopes for this product. When I took it out of the box and put the batteries in, I was really disappointed. It just looked like white dots on the ceiling. The constellations were very hard to make out. We will be returning this item."
1,useless,"Useless. Can barely make out the constellations. Just looks like a bunch of smudges on the ceiling. I know it isn't supposed to be great at this price point, but this bad??? Think ""Phantom Menace"" if you have any inclination of pressing that ""add to cart"" tile."
2,Book Lacking Essence,"I practically live on Amazon buying for most of my essential research & life.Among those, this book score very poor.It's honest & heart-warming PERSONAL story about a man who became a doctor,but as a medical book(how to manage your health),which i EXPECTED it to be, it hardly worth the money, $19+.He seems highly successful doctor, why does he have to make moneya plain THIN book with a casual PERSONAL story ?Besides, Arginine, Vitamin D, hardly contains worthwhile information on health.My rate for this book is: so so story, outrageous price.If it were $5.00, it would make good & casual reading."
3,Good looking gun but...,"These guns look good but they seem to be prone to easy breakage. I dropped one and the ""top slide"" cracked and fell off the gun. On another one I own, the slide (seemingly randomly) got stuck but now it's free but you can see some of the part has come away from the rest of the slide near the very front end of the gun, just under the barrel. I don't fire these guns but I use them as movie props. I don't know why they are so susceptible to damage but apparently they are."
3,Dios mio!,"This is a solo album by Kamal, formerly of The Jerky Boys. It is a mix of prank phone calls and comedy skits. The phone calls are generally moderately funny. The skits are good for a few laughs, despite being in very bad taste. There are four unlisted bonus prank phone calls performed by a Southerner named ""Buck"". These calls are funny, but because of a mastering error, all four calls are played twice at the end of the CD."
4,no more buying car chargers for cell phones,"in our family, everyone has a different style cell phone, so every two years when we got new phones, it meant buying a new car charger for each phone... well, no more! we decided to just buy an inverter for each car, and that way we can just plug in the charger that is included with each phone, we'll never buy another cell phone car charger again!! and we'll be all set to plug in laptops and digital camera batteries also when we go on trips! great little item, no dangling wires, only drawback is the fan noise, which is easily overcome by radio/cd playing in the car."
2,Bad Experience,The cooling fan was making noise on initial use. After a few hours of use the cooling fan stopped working causing the unit to overheat. It could have been an isolated occurance. I sent it in for exchange. Otherwise it's a nice design.
2,Caused bleeding,"I used this for one month (starting on the first day of my cycle) and that was the first time in my life that I had heavy ovulation bleeding and spotting during the luteal phase. I stopped using it and things are back to normal. I did not notice any difference in CM. Be carefull, this can mess with your cycle."
4,Its worth trying!,"I have been taking this product for two months now. I forget to take it at times so I don't always take it 3 times a day. But, I have noticed a considerable difference in CM. I think if it is taken as directed it may help even more. It is definitely worth trying!"
2,Beware of headaches !!,"I've had debilitating migraines for years. They've been under control for the past few years now with herbal supplements and lifestyle/diet changes. I used this product for a few days and lo and behold I had terrible headaches that start a few hours after taking the pill and stop once I skip a couple of days. I did some research on the main ingredient in FertileCM, L-Arginine and I found this on the livestrong.com website ""....Because of its dramatic effect on blood vessels, L-Arginine can cause headaches as a side effect in some individuals. L-Arginine opens the blood vessels throughout the body, including those within the brain. For some people, that leads to headaches, especially in people prone to tension headaches and migraines....""So that's that...I'm going to have to try something else for some CM. For those of you who have no problems, I'm glad it worked !"
1,Yikes!!!,"This CD is scary!!! i usually love indian music, but.....this was bad. no wonder they don't let you listen to any samples."
4,Loved It!,I enjoyed every bit of this book and had a hard time putting it down. I can't wait to get out and pick up the rest of the books in this series.
5,Great information source as well as excellent photo source,"I found this book to be an excellent source of information for any GTO enthusiast. It has a great combination of numerical facts and figures, little known facts and restoration information, and plenty of photos of GTO's from the common driven restored cars right up to the rarest nut and bolt restored examples. It does a good job of pointing out some of the differences in correct original restorations and driver quality restorations. I have a number of GTO books, and this one has the best balance of just about all of them, and it covers all years thoroughly. If you are doing a full restoration on a car, this book will not give you the extensive detail of the GTO Restoration Guide, but it does contain a lot of great information that you won't find in some of the other GTO books available, and it's presented in a very polished format."
3,Not bad,"I've been having these pans for almost two years. The smaller is used ocasionally and still in great condition. The bigger is used on daily basis, treated very gently, only used with silicone spatula, never sudden temperature changes, gently hand washing. After a year and a half of gentle daily use it lost the non stick surface and requires oil like other regular frying pans. Now things stick to it."
2,it works but the non-stick surface already started to peel-off after 2 weeks,"It worked great frying sticky stuffs like eggs when it was received. The complain I have is that the non-stick surface started to peel off around the center after about 2 weeks. No dishwasher, no scrubbing being done to it. just sponge cleaning. The price is good though so I might need to get a new pair pretty soon"
2,Defective or poor quality,"In brief, while the 12"" lasted perhaps 25 uses, it was fine - however the non-stick coating flaked off in 1/2"" square patches after this brief usage.The smaller pan is still ok, but it's not worth the cost of sending in the 12"" pan if there is no assurance of replacement (replacement is at disgression of manufacturer)and then getting another 25 uses assuming the same problem exists."
5,Great pans!,"These pans are the best nonstick pans I have ever used. I tried eggs the very next day I got them to truly test them out, and it passed with flying colors, my eggs slipped all over on this pan. I would recommend this to all of my friends."
5,The Country Boy Cook!,"I've had this over a year and made myself use no metal cooking in this and they are by far the best pans I have ever owned. Note: you are not to use them in a dishwasher and I have not, but they are so easy to clean."
2,Disappointing... Spend the money on better cookware,"Bought these at BB&B; for $50.00 USD. Thought it was a great deal. After only 18 months of use, the bottoms of both are beginning to warp. I know this because they do not sit flat on my flat-top electric range. I contacted the kind folks at Calphalon, and was informed they would cover warping under the warranty. One catch... I get to pay the cost of shipping them to the manufacturer. So the kind folks at UPS will happily ship my $50 set of pans for about $15. If their product fails, and they cover the failure under warranty, they should also cover the cost for me to return their defective product to them.My advice, stay away from the cheap aluminum pans from Calphalon and spend the extra $$ to get a better pan. I have learned my lesson. It isn't worth the hassle, even if they are covered under warranty. I would rather have a pan the works, and continues to work through the years."
2,Edges like an aluminum can,"I'm returning this pan to Calphalon. I have an entire set of CS Nonstick, which Calphalon says it doesn't make anymore. So, when I returned one of my CS pans to Calphalon for a warranty replacement, it sent me a Contemporary Nonstick. It is FAR worse than the CS, which is stainless steel and dishwasher safe. This one is aluminum and not dishwasher safe. In hand-washing my new pan, the edge of it sliced open my finger. On closer examination, I realized the the edge was not smooth and clean like my CS; rather the edges were like they were cut by a can-opener: generally smooth, but with some jagged spots and sharp as heck! Oh, and even with olive oil, food stuck in some places, so the pan's not worth it for the nonstick either."
4,Great pan - poorly designed cut out in handle,"I finally had to replace my old Calphalon, and so far, this pan affords no complaints except for the cut out in the handle for hanging. We have a ceiling pot rack in our kitchen, and this pan is a real pain to remove from the hanger. They cut the hole at an awkward angle, which forces you to lift the pan a full 90 degrees to get it off of the hook. Our rack hangs from the ceiling, out of the way of anyone banging their heads, so unless you are seven feet tall, you really have to stretch to get this off. My hooks are also ""floating"" which allows me to move them around, and they often come right off with the pan. It seems as if this ""angular"" cut out was meant to look edgy and trendy, but it's a major design flaw. You have to wonder if anyone at Calphalon bothered to actually hang this pot up, when they designed that stupid hole."
4,Favorite pans,"These are the pans that get used in my house almost every day. They are heavy which distributes the heat evenly, but make the big one difficult to carry when it's full. The nonstick surfaces are better than most, but don't last forever. After about 4 years of frequent use, they started sticking a bit."
5,Calphalon Contemporary Nonstick 10-Inch & 12-Inch Omelet Combo Pack,"Only few months, love them so far, hope the surface lasts longer than Calphalon 2 yr olds these are replacing!"
2,Not made as good as they used to be.,"Originally, we had a different non-stick in the professional series, which is no longer made. After many years of use, hand washing with soft towels, and using only Calphalon utensils and wooden spoons, the non-stick finish began to wear and peel off some of our cookware. Nothing lasts forever and Calphalon does have a great lifetime warranty so we sent them in but they were replaced with the Contemporary Nonstick as seen here. We then had mismatched cookware hanging on a pot rack. Worse, the non-stick coating began to wear and peel off all the new pans within six months of use. Now I have some of the older pans that need replacing as well as these defective the new ones, but I do not want to have them replaced just to have to do this again in just another six months.I think I would rather go back to a good set made of stainless steel at this point."
4,Good book,"I don't have the second edition of this book but did read the first, and the authors do a fine job of introducing the reader to the computational side of algebraic geometry. I will forego a chapter by chapter review therefore, but no doubt the second edition (which I do not own) is as well-written as the first. I would recommend it to anyone interested in the many applications of algebraic geometry and to those who need to understand how to compute things in algebraic geometry. The good thing about this book is that it gives a concrete flavor to a highly abstract subject. Algebraic geometry, through its applications to coding theory, cryptography, and computer graphics, is fast becoming the subject to learn. It is no longer just an esoteric, high-brow subject but one that is taking on major importance in the information age. Even without applications though it is a fascinating subject, and readers will get a taste of this in this book."
4,Good tutorial and reference literature!,"I bought this book for one purpose. To learn SOA and WSE basics fast.My background is senior software engineer and I've been working with .Net Web projects but not SOA. I was able to implement a WS Secure conversation between a web client and a web service in two weeks. Both using a common WS Policy document. The book gave me the basics, the understanding and the ability to implement WS Security. Though I recommend also to use the code examples provided by apress.com site related to this book./Magnus Backeus - Softronic AB - Sweden"
1,Never judge a book by its cover,"A very disappointing book. After reading the back cover and flicking through I expected much more.Despite what you might think the core of the book is actually how to configure security and policy for web-services almost a hundred pages is given to this topic.Given that WSE is a ""plugable"" architecture there are no real examples of how to go about plugging in anything. Don't get sucked in like I did by thinking that this book will have some information on showing you how to plug in MSMQ as a transport, as in too many cases in this book this topic is out of scope.This book should have been called ""An Overview of WSE: and the current state of WS standards in .Net""."
1,Disney Karaoke,Had I known there were no on screen lyrics - I would not have bought these CD's Now I am stuck with three cd's with music I already have with the original people on them. Afterall Karaoke is singing with lyrics on the screen isn't it. I am very disappointed.
5,Great for Road Trips,"Most of my college friends have moved off to different cities, and it's quite a haul to visit them. Music in the car is nice, but I always get the urge to sing! That's why I enjoy this CD so much. First we are treated to somewhat simplified arrangements of ten great songs, ranging from classics like ""Once Upon a Dream"" to more current songs like ""Reflections"" from Mulan. Each is performed by an artist who does an excellent job of enunciating to help the budding singer hear the words and where they go (the lyrics in the booklet help too!). The next ten tracks are the same songs, but without the lead vocals. Simple, elegant, fun.Which leads to the two caveats: 1.) The ""20 Tracks"" label shouldn't be confused with 20 songs and 2.) There are no special lyrics/pictures/etc. encoded on the disc. Several other reviewers have groused on point two, but I see it as being like enhanced CD's: Sure the extras are neat, but I buy it for the music."
2,not CD + G,"The product is good but these are NOT CD + G so the lyrics will not show up on the viewing screen of your Karaoke machine,"
1,Disappointed,"I wish I'd read the previous reviews more closely. When I searched [...] for cd+g selections, this came up. I purchased volume one and two for my son's birthday only to find they are NOT cd+Graphics. There are no graphics to display on a karaoke machine. It was VERY disappointing since, for him, much of the fun came from being able to see the words.Amazon.com should not advertise these discs as cd+graphics."
1,This is not Karaoke Music,"Beware of what you are purchasing here... I bought this item thinking I was getting such a great bargain. $3 less than another cd with Mickey Mouse on the cover... what a rip off.IF IT SAYS IT'S KARAOKE MUSIC THE LYRICS SHOULD SHOW UP ON THE SCREEN!!!If it doesn't have lyrics it's just a regular music CD!This music cd only has a lyric booklet to sing along too.These are not the original soundtrack versions of the songs. Other performers sing the songs. In some cases you can barely tell the differences, but in most, it is obvious it's not who you expected."
2,Disney Karaoke Vol.2 [KARAOKE],"Quite disappointed that there are no screen lyrics available. Although some say karaoke is merely singing the lyrics to the instrumental version of the song, modern day tapes and cd's *do* include the ""CDG"". Disney seems to fall behind the times. You're better off with a sing-along video -- at least then the kids might learn to read (or at least recognize words). My 4 & 2 year olds wouldn't know what to do with just the instrumental version, of 'true' karaoke. I do prefer vol2 over vol1 or vol3."
1,not karaoke,"Ignore the big word ""Karaoke"" on the cover and the microphone shown, this is just a music CD, it does not display anything in a karaoke player."
2,NOT for a karaoke machine but great music,"Disney Karaoke, Volume 2This CD is WILL NOT show lyrics on a karaoke screen. It is great if all you want is music. We bought it for a birthday party for my daughter in which karaoke was the main attraction. This CD has a booklet of tiny words with the lyrics. It WILL NOT show up on a karaoke screen. VERY disappointing."
4,Mills is able to expand on topics already in the news,"Kyle Mills writting is getting better with each book. He has the ability to take topics from the news and apply a different spin than most writters. His ability to incorporate reality and just enough paranoia, makes for captivating reading. I have recommended him to all my friends , and am looking forward to his next book. Also, at just over 300 pages, Mill's makes for a relaxing weekend read when time is of a premieum."
4,Even better than Rising Phoenix,"It's official, I'm a Kyle Mills fan!!! This book will make you laugh even as it becomes impossible for the reader to put down!!"
5,Truth Stranger Than Any Fiction,"I just finished reading The Rise of David Duke. It was one of the best books I've ever read. It was an illuminating tale about an important character from the late 20th century. The book was both educational and easy to read. I would recommend it to anyone who truly wants to understand David Duke. This is not a story that Duke would want told. Written by a top flight, Pulitzer-Prize winning investigative reporter, it is meticulously researched, speaking truth stranger than any fiction."
2,Recycled Junque,"Fascinating recreation of throwaway '80's synth-disco. If you are Eurotrash or wannabee, get it. Me, I prefer quintessential Eurotrash synth-disco with more attitude, such as Grace Jones -- no contest!"
5,Great Battery!,I am very pleased with my Li-Ion Battery for Sony Np-F550.It works perfect with my video camera. The price of the battery was excellent!
5,Very good deal!,This battery was a perfect fit for my Sony Mavica camera. It has returned my camera to like new working order. I have no reservations about buying another if ever needed.
3,"Resilience -- OK, now what?","The Resilience Factor purports to be a ""how to"" book for improving one's ability to withstand the stresses of life -- learning to ""improve capacity to handle inevitable surprises and setbacks."" Once you wade through the ineptly written case studies, learning how ""Claude"" or ""Mary"" or whoever adjusted to the fact that they were not coping well, the seven lessons are unimaginative.Take a Cosmopolitan quiz on how to meet girls -- or boys -- and be done with it.This book, The Resilience Factor, is a disappointment: misleading at best -- and a fraud at worst. If this is an example of the University of Pennsylvania's best work in psychology, I suggest you go elsewhere."
2,Disappointing.,"John Lee Hooker is, of course, The Man, but you'd never know it from listening to this collection. The Man's performances are good as ever, but the engineering and production are appaling.Some damned fool got the bright idea to somehow double Hooker's vocals so he seems to be dueting with himself. Stupid! Some other damned fool (or maybe the same one?) got the equally bright idea to overdub a sped up guitar on a few tracks so it sounds like some sort of half-***ed mandolin. Stupid! Stupid! The vocals in some tracks are so distorted by overloading that they are unintelligable. Bad, bad, bad!Skip this one. Get the much superior ""John Lee Hooker Plays And Sings The Blues"".Two stars instead of one only because it's The Man."
2,Not the best,"Working these things in the woods is different from your living room. If you want to quickly load both a powder charge and a projectile, with gloves on your hands, these are slower and more awkward to use than some other brands --- especially if you are using loose powder. There are others that work better."
5,Trippingly On The Tongue,"This book is marvelously informative for those wishing to speak the language of Early Modern English. Be prepared to jostle the cobewebs from high school english and relearn basic sentance structures and verb conjugations in order to rethink in the prose of days of yore. Both witty and historical, this book makes learning fun."
1,Never Received It,"I ordered this book for my best friends little girl for Christmas and as of mid January have not received it. I love the book itself and read it in a local bookstore, but found it much cheaper from this company on Amazon only it never arrived. I would not order from this company again."
4,Pretty Decent TV for SD,"I give it a 4 star because of the enormous weight. I will point out that it is not a true HD tv, it is HD-Ready. Which means that it is capable of decoding the HD signal and displaying it. However, it does NOT display it at HD resolution. On to my main complaint, the thing weighs in at what seems to be about 800 lbs, though actually much less. It is a bear to move mainly due to the fact that there are no real good ways to get a grip on it and the heavy weight. If you are a renter who doesn't stay in one place for more than a year at a time I would suggest a lighter model."
4,Green Man found at last!,"I have many of the movies that had Alistair Sim as a star - and had been searching for this title for years. I originally saw his films in the 60's while at the University of Minnesota, through the multiple film clubs in the metro area. He adds a quality of character to his films that really makes them great as a whole - even as a detective in one of them. His reactions to plans messed up is one of the ways he makes the films wonderful. The team of actors with him in this film greatly increase the humor."
2,Ellis Skolfield Books,"I have not read ""Sozo, Survival Guide for a Remnant Church"".I decided to take it off my wish list.Here's why: I remembered that I purchased and read another book by this author --- and did not like it.I thought it contained some serious scriptural errors.Furthermore, the title, ""Islam in the End Times"" seems inappropriate to me, since there was very little in it about Islam.I was hoping to read about their eschatology so that I could compare it with Christian eschatology.I was very disappointed when I discovered that he went into none of that.He only mentions Islam in reference to some prophecies that I think he has mis-interpreted.While I would not mind reading another book by this author, for free, I would not pay money to do so."
1,Why waste money...?,book was boring.not very motivating at all. if you want to become a better write search for something else. If your into politics the this is an interesting book to read .i am not in too politics so this book was not interesting or helpful to me.
3,Not to Bad,While my dog did chew the cyber bone into bits it lasted longer than her kongs that are double the price do.
3,A pimp who cares beyond his own vested interest,"It seems almost paradoxically to have a story of a pimp who truly cares about the welfare of working girls he is responsible for. This film presents such a situation. It is a thriller genre movie with a mockumentary undertone. Woody the pimp, played by Robert Cavanah, is convincing and takes the viewer into the grubby world of prostitution and organised crime. The film has a decent introduction, a flabby middle, and a few surprises at the end.Nicholas R.W. Henning - Australian Author"
1,half a concert,I just received my copy of the DVD and am sending it back to Amazon. It has only about half of the songs I have on my VCR version. I'm very disappointed and will keep my VCR tape a longer time than I had expected.
1,sucks...,"Unbelievable. ""My back pages"" is not included? I wonder who was the brainless person that cut this masterpiece and published only pieces of it..."
2,Tool Bits Fall Out,"I have not used the actual tools yet, but I was disappointed as the plastic case does not hold all the bits in place securely. Every time you close it, 3-4 items fall out of place. They should have spent more time designing the case. Also, the case does not lock securely. I am sure the tools will work fine."
2,Whiny and trite...,"Aidoo gives new meaning to the term ""female whiner"". Her brief ""novel""(about 132 pages) is a trying exercise in whining about being a woman, and being an African. She may have cause to whine, but please spare us the long poems that break up the text. If I wanted to read poetry, I'd buy a poetry book. I hate it when authors insert poems in midstream. It breaks up the text, and detracts from the action. Anyway, Sissie is a Ghanaian who visits Germany, makes cute with a German woman, and reflects on how bad colonization and Africans can be. Not recommended except for insommiacs."
2,The Kindergarten Pig Book,"I just wasn't impressed with the detail of this book. Unless you know NOTHING of raising pigs, don't buy this one. The ""Storey's Guide to Pigs"" by Kelly Klober was much more informative, buy it. Sorry."
1,Don't like the information!!,"Raised on a farm, I learned to respect pigs and not use this type of information for the ideas in this book. Please don't buy this useless book. It is not about the ethics we need in this country. Thank you"
4,Excellent!,"This book is great for a student or a practicing engineer. It starts with the fundamentals of polymer science and ends with more specific processing problems. There are design problems at the end of each chapter for which solutions are not provided. This is great for a college textbook, but is not very useful for the practicing engineer. Overall, this book is well worth it."
3,"Maybe not T.S, Eliot at his best?","A more famous version and maybe better isBecket.A verse play that fails by me...I think what I miss by comparison is Henry II in this play.The point in terms of history is that the power of the churchin English history will decline from here.Henry II may have been in the wrong, but he never reallygave the command for his friend's death as history seems to have it(""Will no one rid me of this meddlesome priest?"").The Medieval Church was at times as powerful as kings.An Archbishop was second only to the Pope in that powerover the churches: he was literally a prince of God on earth.So the crime of killing such an one was not a light one.Was Thomas Becket a martyr?"
1,Ripped off,"This book was advertised as a hardback. In fact, it is actually a paperback book like all the others on Amazon only it cost more. My son needed it for school or we would have sent it back."
2,Works but has a weakness,"This cord has been used from my home theater system. It hangs down and isn't tugged or anything. Almost immediately the cord had a ""cut out"" position where if it were dangling from a certain angle one of the headphones would cut out. Very annoying but I got this for like $3 w/shipping so it's cheap.I've recently picked up a pair of Sennheiser HD 202 headphones and the cord is long enough that I do not have to use this anymore.Ease of use: 5 because it plugs in like it's supposed to.Sound Quality: 2 because it cuts out and is cheaply made."
5,A Great Read,"I found myself reading this book through in two sittings. If you like history, personal stories, diaries or the like, you will enjoy this book. I compare it to Jimmy Carter's An Hour Before Daylight in that it gives a picture of rural life in the early part of the century. It is human, candid, and lean in its verbage. It captures all of the emotions and leaves you with mental images that will last a lifetime. Try it."
3,Nesting Tables,"I owned one set of these tables, liked them and ordered a second set. The are not ""high quality"" but good enough for our family room. They look like better quality than what they cost. Having 6 tables available but using the space of two on an everyday basis is great."
2,"Didn't really need to know how to say ""rasberry""","OK, so as far as I know this is the only cutsie interactive way to learn Mongolian, so this CD deserves some credit. On the other hand, the words are selected from the same list as the other languages, so you get to spend your precious time learning words like ""rasberry"" instead of the far more useful ""call off your dog!"" Also, there's only just the intro CD, so you have to look elsewhere to learn more."
4,solid instrumental rock album,"When i first received this album i didn't know what to expect, but i was pleasantly surprised with the tracks. the music is very powerfull, significant and very melodic. only one song features vocals and the rest are instrumental so if u dont like music without vocals i wouldnt recommend this album. the songs are all fresh and interesting...overall a good buy"
2,Misguided Cuban Potpourri,"This CD is not a rough guide to son. Although the selections are in most cases good by themselves it includes guaracha (Nico Saquito), cha-cha-cha from Orquesta Aragon and timba from Los Van Van. In my opinion this is just another compilation intent on cashing in the ""Buena Vista Social Club"" phenomenon. The CD spans almost a century of Cuban music, from Maria Teresa Vera to Cubanismo, thus labelling ""son"" what really is a variety of forms and styles of Cuban music. Not for somebody seriously trying to learn about ""son"""
3,DW1803 Mandrel,"Appears to be a well built product. I've had frustrations with the quick change collar releasing while using it and results in a stuck mandrel in the hole saw. Today, after many years of use, one of the two pins in the quick connect broke off. I'm confused how it managed it, since the engineering would make one think it would be impossible."
2,A disappointment to G&S fans,"As a Gilbert & Sullivan fan (and a member of the Pittsburgh Savoyards G&S company), I was thrilled to learn that there is a series of videos of most G&S shows. But the series is very disappointing, and Pinafore is a good example of the series. Peter Marshall is a poor choice for Captain Corcoran, and Frankie Howerd is an incomprehensible choice for Sir Joseph Porter, KCB. Howerd appears to be making up the role as he goes along. The singing is credible (although far from the best I've heard), and the dancing is very good. But the staging is poor, and the entire effect is that the fun of a good Gilbert & Sullivan show is lost."
1,A terrible film,"While the music is fine and the performances are so so, the film, production values, direction, and over all antiseptic quality of this production make it one to miss. It's light opera lite. Don't bother."
3,Another birthday gift,"I'm just gona say . It's a storage container for Game Boy Color Games , nothing fantasy , oh and it was bought for my cousin on his birthday ,Plain and simple."
1,This book is flip and superficial.,"I thought if Ann Landers touted a book so highly in her nationally syndicated column, it should be well worth reading. It was not. Most topics are covered very superficially. Dr. Rosenfeld seems to promote pills and surgery and other expensive procedures without paying enough attention to costs and side effects."
2,Disappointing,"Upon the purchase of this book, I anticipated new insights and information regarding preventative anti-aging breakthroughs. I felt the title was very misleading and, therefore, disappointed in the content. Although readable, it failed to say anything ""new"". It amounts to your basic medical handbook and should be titled accordingly."
2,I didn't learn much.,"If you haven't been living in a cave for the past ten years you already know everything in this book. Exercise = good, high fat diet = bad, smoking causes cancer, keep active and learning as you get older. I was looking for a book that could guide me now, when I'm in my 40s, to maybe eek out another 10-15 quality years doing something that I wasn't doing already. There is nothing untrue or misleading in the book -- just nothing new."
1,Doesn't fit.,"I bought an Adaptec 1420A USB 2.0 card for an older laptop that only had USB 1.1 ports. Being a cardbus card it is not inherently powered thus won't fully work with USB devices needing a powered connection (IPOD, IPAQ, etc.). It does have a power socket that can make it a powered card by accepting power from an external source.I next bought this cable ACK-1420A-USB, which was apparently designed specifically for that card. It seemed like a reasonably elegant solution at the time -- taking power from the USB 1.1 ports, so I could use the card while working from battery (with no AC connecton available).Problem: the connector on the cable does NOT fit the card. It is far too big. It also did NOT come with any adapters to make it fit the card it was supposedly designed to fit. Adaptec apparently does not realize a 5.0mm plug won't fit a 3.5mm hole!How does a cable NOT fit the card it was specifically designed to fit? How can it be ""off"" by so much?? Oooops!!"
5,between the giant twin oaks,"Between the Giant Twin Oaks is a passionately written, and entertaining novel that presents a powerful message about family bonds, pride, love and conflicts that arise in families and other significant relationships. Ellis-Maxwell is clearly a great storyteller with a bright future as an author."
2,"edible, but what are the ingredients I'm eating??","I bought a box, and will definitely finish them rather than toss them away but they taste artificial. Also, take a look at the ingredient lists. Not very natural or wholesome. Too bad..."
3,Good Region Overview,"We found this book to be a pretty good overview of the Los Cabos region. You can pretty much get to anywhere you want to go using this book. Most of the hotels and restaurants are detailed, but not enough detail is given. If you are looking for recommendations, they are hard to find in this book. For the most part it just describes what the establishment offers. The author does cover all of the areas. We found details on the East Cape region lacking in other books. Although not extensively covered in this book, it did have the best information we could find. To be honest, this area is fairly simple, and this guide does a good job at telling you what you can expect where. I would recommend this book for travelers to the region, but it could use more reviews of the many dining and lodging options, could use some updating, and would benefit from a more comprehensive mapping of the various regions. Please check out the detailed trip report at diveatlas.com for more details."
5,Packs a lot of Punch!,"It is well said that we ought not to judge a book by its cover, maybe size is a better word here. But the author has done an extremely successful job of putting across the arguments for Christianity as rational, objective, rational, livable, and believable. If nonbelievers are put off by heavy-duty books on Christian evidences, then they will not go wrong in getting hold of this book. But be forewarned, this book will get you upset over what you are believing about your worldviews! I got mine in Australia while on holiday. Can't seem to find it in Singapore though. Anyone has any ideas of bringing in a load of it to Singapore?"
4,Overall good but lacking in some important details,"I have just came back from China using this book for my travel. One BIG mistake this book did not tell you is DON'T TRAVEL IN CHINA during 5/1-5/5 and 10/1-10/5. Apparently, the WHOLE COUNTRY is on a 5 day holiday. This has been going on for the past 2-3 years. When you look in the book, it only tells you that 5/1 and 10/1 are holidays. No, no, no. Majority of the country is on the move. Transportation, lodging and food service are difficult to find. A lot of government services are either closed or on minimum service schedule.Some of the prices and ticket prices are already out of date. I guess they have not made the effort to update this.A train schedule with explaination would've been extremely helpful. I was lucky to be able to speak Chinese. Even I was unable to make head or tail of the schedule that I brought. You can only buy one way train ticket. If you want round trip, you have to buy it at the other end or through a travel agent."
1,worthless,"Good concept but when the kid gets it wrong, the right answer should come up. Otherwise how are they ever going to learn what the answer should be. Basically all it does is tell you if your answer is wrong or right. Worthless. I used it for myself a few times and that was the first thing that came to mind. Oh well you live and learn. Good to have these reviews so others don't spend their hard earned money that depletes wallet and take up valuable space in small house."
4,He likes it...,This is an easy way to get your child to study and develop their math skills. It should have an auto shut off or if it does it does not work. It goes through batteries quickly.
5,"Once your ride Australian, you never go back.","Been riding Australian off and on for about a decade. Once you try one, you never willing go back. It is in that perfect niche between English and Western Saddles. This saddle is much better for the horse than most Western saddles, but far more useful on trails then an English.I finally broke down and bought this saddle from Down Under last Summer. Ever since it arrived, I have always chosenit. The suspended saddle seat is a feature you will love. AND, if you happen to have a smooth gaited horse like my Bashkir, you will seem to float over the ground. It really is that comfortable.One note though, be careful of your sizing and also this saddle can be adjusted for the withers, so make sure to buy it from someone who knows how to do it. Your horse will thank you for it."
2,Reflections (Disappointment),"The Temptations has always been my all time favorite group. However, this cd is a big disappointment. Vocally the group is in fine form. The material is classic motown. Now, this cd is the first for the label new door. Why start a new label and re-record songs that were on your old label. There's nothing new to the arrangements that we haven't already heard before. What would have been great. If Smokey Robinson would have produced a few songs. Or Norman Whitfield and or even Stevie Wonder. Then the cd might have been great. The group is always a pleasure to listen too though. There's a few bright spots. I just can't seem to get used to the new lead singer in ""GC CAMRERON"". Don't get me wrong he's a good singer. He's just not as strong a lead as the singers in the past. I'm looking forward to a cd with more original material."
4,Tempts Still doing it like no others on the music scene,"When you set the standard, you are always under the gun, you can't rest on your past treasures. And the tempts have that , they have undergone many member chnages, it's tough to be a tempt. I do wish they not brought in G.C. and kept the other brotha but it's tough being a tempt. This Cd I have had in my chnager for tyhe last 2 weeks. I like it more and more , these brothas can just flat out sing. They are singing classics. you can't chnage a classic you just add your specail touch and that is what they have done. They are still touring and recording. I would love to have them perform on some of these shows like BET and let theses so called singers see the masters."
2,I Still Love The Legend of the Tempts,"This is definitely not the best work of the Temptations. I would think former lead singers David Ruffin and Eddie Kendrick are turning over in their collective graves. Dennis Edwards is probably covering his ears every time he hear these Motown favorites sung by this sorry group...Two of the songs sorta stick out (Can I get a Witness & Try It Baby)... Try It Baby has a nice comedy flavor to it, and Can I get a witness is just ""santified""...I know this group is much better than this. I think this was a payday.. And did anyone notice that it was produced by overseas investors? That may be the problem...Let's get pass this one and hope their next effort is The Temptations we all know and love to listen to.Al JonesDanville, CA"
1,Yep,"I play 10/20 hold 'em, so these cards cost less than 1 small bet. But, once I used them, they pretty much immediately made me money. I don't have to wonder whether I have the odds right, I don't have to figure them out on the spot. I know. No guesswork. And, I realized that I was miscalculating the odds for a few situations, so using these cards fixed a pretty big leak in my game.These cards are terrific! When I use these cards to play Texas Hold'em, I learn more about the game every time.I highly recommend this product, they are fun to play with and even fun to learn from. Poker Flash Cards have made a tremendous impact on my overall game. I can see a marked improvement in my decision-making ability and my betting strategies."
3,Power Systems,Great book. Great detail in the structure of its material and it has detailed examples that are easy to follow.I would highly recommend this book for and EE.
2,Depressing but curiously interesting,"The little girl Abigail Breslin will steal your heart. You just cannot help but fall in love with her - she is so innocent and vulnerable and beautiful on the inside. But the rest of the movie is pretty boring. No laugh out loud moments until the very end. The rest of the cast wasn't bad, but hard to believe most of the time. Many of the gags are recycled from other movies like Vacation. Steve Carrell is a comic genius, but he does nothing in this movie. I would definitely skip it. Most definitely do not buy it - you won't watch more than once."
5,Dysfunctional isn't always a bad thing!,"I absolutely loved this movie. It's in the same genre as The Royal Tennebaums but not as dark. The not-so-subtle jab at the ""Little Miss"" Beauty contests skillfully illustrates up how bizarre that industry really is. The characters were well developed and the ending was a winner!!"
3,taking a bus trip to nowhere ...,"its a good tho overpraised movie. i liked the cast most of all, especially greg kinnear who is as usual underrated. paul dano is kinda hot as the teen slacker, and abigail breslin (almost as fat as big bro spencer, but vastly more talented) is quite good in a disarming way, tho i doubt theres more there than what we have already seen (ill be glad to be proven wrong, btw). alan arkin, of course, is alan arkin: giving the quintessential supporting performance as the raunchy heroin-snorting family patriarch. still, the writing is a trifle too obvious to me to bring this into the ranks of the really good."
1,Not a Movie for the Family,"Just take a look at the key words and see if that is what you want to sit down and expose to your family. Dark Comedy is an understatement. While the plot is fresh, keep kids away from this movie. The time spent to get to the punchline is filled with shocking dialogue and cold, vapid, wasted space. Nothing warm here. If any family resembles the characters in this movie, they need to be in therapy rather than watching movies. Sure, Alan Arkin won an Oscar, but that is a sad testimony to what Un-Holywood considers Oscar-worthy. Any of his previous performances were better."
1,2 hours of my life I'd like to have back!,"Don't waste your time or money on this miserable excuse for a film. There is no redeeming quality to this film at all. The story is lame, there is no humor, and really no message at all. I found this film very depressing and dark. With a title like ""Little Miss Sunshine"" I expected a feel-good comedy with a message. What I got was a depressing, dark, film with no story. Sorry I wasted my time and money!"
4,Pretty Funny!,"This movie was not quite what we expected and started out rather strangely, but was pretty funny and kind of cute. Was worth the money. Glad we bought it. Would do so again."
1,very disturbing,"If this is comedy. I am very concerned where todays peoples heads are at.This family is not only disfunctional. It is seriously in trouble. The only parts I did like were the Volkswagon bus that could only crank over with a running start by it's owners. I loved Alan Arkin except he was snorting Heroin that ruined him for me. this is a movie that I did not like for the most part but I am probably in the minority in that feeling. never the less that is how I feel, so there you have it.... It is definitly not a kids or family friendly film"
1,The worst film of 2006,"I will not be surprised if Abigail Breslin gets the Razzie this year for Worst Supporting Actress. I was very pleased to read that Alan Arkin only accepted this role because of the large amount of money they offered him. Carell talking about Proust is about as believable as Paul Dano's tearful breakdown near the end of this movie. There was nothing to like about this movie and nothing original about this movie either. If I had to pick one movie to define the Myspace generation, this would be it."
1,this movie bites,"When are people going to get tired of indie grotesques? This is ""quirky"" taken to its logical conclusion -- a family of gimmicks, offered up for our derision. This is shallow, gutless filmmaking."
3,its okay,"mildly entertaining. I like quirky, independent films, and actually expected this to be more quirky after all I'd heard. Wished it had been more quirky. Made me smile a few times, maybe laughed once or twice. Its okay."
5,Little Miss Sunshine is phenomenal,It's been a long time since I've enjoyed a movie as much as I did Little Miss Sunshine. It was the true laughter through tears movie...and I was able to connect with each character. Awesome !!!
2,I kept asking myself... Why did this movie win awards?,"I can't figure out why this movie won so many awards... I can't figure out why it won any awards for that matter. It had some cute parts in it, I guess, and I'm not mad that I watched it, but I certainly wouldn't have bought the movie if I had rented it first. At one point in the movie, when the horn is honking over and over I turned the movie off completly... I ended up watching the rest the next day."
3,This is not a movie for a child.,"I have been wanting this movie for my son for a while and when I get it, it has homosexual conversation the grand father was sniffing heroin openly on screen. I am so mad I got this for my child. Adult movie if you like corney stuff. And suicide! AND at the end when the child was doing her routine for the Beaty pagent she did a strip tease dance to Rick james super freak. And the parents supported her. Not good."
1,Hollywood and its finest!,"ok, a grandfather sniffing Cocain and a vocabulary limited to four letter words, a gay brother that has attempted suicide because his boyfriend left him, a son that doees not speak. A dad that is a failure. And the best part of it all, the daughter performing a strip tease act at the Little Miss Sunshine contest. Boy what a family movie!!!! Hollywood is really giving us the movies that we need to see?????"
4,sunshine bring smiles,"just loved it - judge it from its contents and not from photography or direction. The latter tow have lot of flaws and could have been far better - specially photography but the contents is excellent - it shows the communication gap and lack of understanding between the extended members of a family - then they start travelling and multiple mishaps and tragedies derail their trip to some extent - but they overcome it through sheer tenacity - each incident showed them the greater truth of peace, understanding and harmony. They learn to come together and act as a family - standing for each other -what I like is that Dayton has not missed the forest for the tree - Greg Kinnear is just fabulous - Abigail Breslin and Alan Arkin is brilliant - you will laugh laugh and laugh"
3,"Made me feel better, but I don't expect much from a second viewing","This movie has quite often been recommended to me by friends, and it is almost ALWAYS on television here in Australia so it must be doing something right, so I decided to give it a try.I was quite pleased with my decision to watch the film and it made me feel a bit better from illness for the 2 hours it lasted.However I don't expect much more from more viewings, I doubt I'll opt to watch it with friends at a movie marathon and I doubt I'll go out of my way to watch it again.That being said it's a fun little movie that most other people will enjoy again and again.I would happily recommend it to people, despite not being extremely fond of it."
1,The Substitute Teacher's Survival Guide,"This book was written to be humorous, but it isn't. It also is not helpful, let alone a survival guide, and it was a huge waste of money...($$$)."
5,Great Book!!!,"This is a great book! It is not only informative but fun too. Wight and Simmons definitely know what they are talking about and have a great sense of humor along with it. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to know about teaching, not only for subs but for full-time teachers as well. This is also inexpensive and makes for a great gift. Great job!"
1,Far too uncomfortable,"I'm a gamer. I play for hours a day and currently use a simple MS intellimouse optical. Well I was looking for something a little more pro, and in my searching I saw the Razer line of gaming mice. I uncharacteristly ordered one based on the specs without trying one out, only to find that it is far too bulky and uncomfortable to play with.It's got large rubber triming down each side, so it is cumbersome to get to the left side buttons. I only say the left side because the right side buttons are so miserably place you will NEVER, EVER, be able to reach them during game play. It also feels too long and flat, so the scroll wheel is note easily reached, and your hand does not rest comfortably.Yeah, it looks great, and I'm sure it's doing an amazing job a moving precisely. However, I can't get it to move correctly in my hand due to its horrible shape, so for gaming, it's rather worthless."
1,after 3 months of use - MINUS 3 Stars,"I'm pleased with this sturdily made purse...beautiful leather and FRYE hardware.....extra FRYE dust bag which I was not expecting. Drawbacks are that the zippers do not glide well, inside is lined with DARK fabric, making it difficult to see things, and the straps are not quite long enough to wear over my shoulder. Other than that, got a great deal on a nice purse that ought to hold up well to everyday use. BTW - The fryeboots website states that this item is made in ITALY---3-18-09 UPDATE: The brass buttons have started to fall off and Amazon's return/exchange policy only covers the first 30 days. This item only gets light use, as it is not my ""everyday purse""."
1,"A book that does not belong in the ""Complete Guide"" series","A warning to potential buyers: this book does not offer track-by-track commentary, like other titles on the ""Complete Guide to The Music of..."" series. The author simply uses each Queen album as a book chapter and re-tells the group's story for the upteenth time. Also, he states in no uncertain terms that what Queen did best was ""disposable pop"". So much for the band's heavier songs - powerful rockers such as ""The Prophet Song"", ""Sheer Heart Attack"", ""Brighton Rock"" and ""Son and Daughter"", to name a few. I wonder how this book was approved for this series. It should have been written by someone who really appreciated Queen's whole body of work and not just the singles."
2,"Disappointing entry in the ""Complete Guide"" series","The book on Queen should have been part of ""The Complete Idiot's Guide"" series. Hogan seems more interested in doing a biography of the group, instead of covering their ""music"" (which is supposed to be the series' aim). This book is recommended only to people who are unfamiliar with Queen and their story."
2,poor quality,the quality of this product is very poor. the whiskers were all bent. the packaging was horrible and the strap on the back the goes around the head broke after a few uses. this was for my 7 yr old daughter - very disappointed.

4,Fitting was ok,I bought this for my 06 jetta. It matches the dashboard to the interior very well. The only problem I had with it is that there was a little gap at the top.
1,"Worst company to deal with, by far!","This company doesn't deliver, so be careful! They have sold me one of their matresses, charged my credit card, and then refused to ship the product unless I paid them additional money! They already have my credit card info so they suggested charging the additional funds! I said heck no! I agree on a price and they change it as they please and then hold my credit card hostage? I still have a shipping charge on my CC which they refuse to reimburse! Buyer beware!"

5,exactly what it claims to be,"While it isn't the most fascinating book I've ever read, this lives up to its title. It is an unusual, but very effective, introduction to basic economic concepts for people who would rather die than crack open an economics textbook. The choice of real-world examples and the generally humorous tone make the learning painless. I skimmed the glossary before I started and was intimidated by the quantity and complexity of some of the terms that were used, but by the time I had finished reading the book and took another look at the glossary, I found I was comfortable with the terms and concepts. Highly recommended."
2,"Good Music, Poor recording","It's obvious that this is beautiful music, but this recording is very poorly engineered. Either the wrong microphones were used or they are placed too far from the singers, allowing the ambient resonance of the space to destroy the clarity of the vocal lines. In writing this spare, clarity of both instrumental and vocal lines are essential to the recording's success. This is especially regrettable since there are so few recording currently available."
3,groove armada northern star,"groove armada totally set me reeling with the opening track of ""vertigo"" (their 2nd ,and to my mind far superior release].This is ""nice"" chill music,but in terms of longlasting ""I will still love this release in 10 years"" appeal it does not get this stamp.As they say in showbiz ""Nice ,but no cigar"". Try the excellent D Note or purchase their classic Vertigo instead"
4,Essential snapshots of life in song,"OK, that sounds hokey, but how do you write a one-line review of an album like this? ""The Dutchman"" has to be one of the sweetest, most poignant love songs ever written, and ""The Ballad of Penny Evans"" has not lost any of its strength over the decades even if it is clearly a song of the Vietnam War. Yet you'll roll on the floor over ""Chicken Cordon Blues,"" ""The Vegetable Song,"" or the classic ""I'm My Own Grandpa,"" and all Chicagoans will identify with ""The Lincoln Park Pirates"" (you might have their equivalent in your town). We lost a marvel too young when Steve died."
1,embarrassing!!!!,"i can't understand the rating this albums been getting no way is it a five out of five!!! i've been a numan fan since day one, been with him through all the highs and lows seen some of the most amazing concerts that nobody will ever surpass!! but i am also not afraid to tell how it how I hear it!!! and jagged is just awful!!(sorry to shout lol!!!!) i refuse to accept that it took over five years to write it sounds like it was made in a week its a pity he didnt have the old tubeway army band in his studio!! i guess halo is my favourite track only because of the percussion garys vocals are horrid pressure gets on my nerves so do his whispery vocals on jagged, give it up gaz!! it didnt work on pure!!! lets hope the next one is better than this!!!!!!"
1,Pure Junk,"This CD is absolutely horrible. I can't see how this was even released. Granted, Gary's music has never really caught on in the US but this is total junk. After listening to Pure I thought there was no way it could get worse but sadly it has.If this happens to be your introduction to Gary Numan's work, don't even bother with this one. I would recommend Replicas, Telekon, Pleasure Principle and Dance. If you want to hear him live, pick up White Noise."
3,More of the same,"this album is very much in the vein of ""pure"", perhaps a touch less melodic than that excellent album. the production, however -- much like ""exile"" and ""sacrifice"" -- leaves something to be desired and there is no question that it isn't great. everything's over-reverby and muddy with insufficient separation, especially the vocals and drums. to some extent this is an aesthetic choice (GN is clearly going for a dense wall-of-sound approach) but it's still too mushy. so overall -- not bad, but very much built off of the same template as ""pure"", which itself was a bit samey -- and should've been better produced."
4,Please Remind Gary to Smile,"My main criticism of this album is that all tracks sound the same, literally the same tempo and key, repeated 11 times (plus the remix.) It's also as if Gary has not really grown much as an artist in nearly 30 years, and is just posing to impress the teenagers. His music seems oddly out of place for a guy approaching 50 with a wife and family. Bowie re-invented himself, so why can't Gary?"
3,still waiting,"I have been a huge Gary Numan fan for years and while I'm not usually one to pine for the ""days of old"", I am just a bit worn out with the angry/dark/goth sound. It seems like there are two camps here (and I'm not questioning anyone's loyalty), those who are geared more to the hard goth/metal sound and those who prefer Gary's etheral, melancholy sound that used to still leave you feeling good. Personally, the flowing dream-like sounds with the underlying fretless bass on recordings like Telekon, Dance and I Assasin can't be beat. But hey, Gary is the atist and he has the right to make the music he wants to make. I'm just glad he's still making music period!"
4,Alpha Animals,"I play this game with my 5 and 3 year olds. My older daughter does find level one easy. It is hard for my three year old, but she is the one that loves the game. I would say it is a fun way to learn letters and their sounds, but it did not start any great interest in animals."
3,Well known actors must have been hard-up for cash. :-(,"These are well known actors and that's why I went ahead and purchased ""Rock n Rolla"". It looked like a really good movie after seeing it on a preview of a different movie. Horrible choice. Don't waste your money!"
5,Fantastic!,"An occasionally gritty flick about the London underground with a moment of emotional clarity provided by the interaction between heterosexual and homosexual friends (Butler and Hardy) - what a film! ""If I could be half the human that Bob is at the price of being a 'puff' - I'd think about it...not for too long, but I'd have to pause."" I loved this film so much after the rental I chose to buy it. RocknRolla....consider yourself endorsed."
1,Life not the safe for Guy after marrying Madge,"This is not a Guy R. film...its complete crap. If you saw Snatch or LSATSB - then you'll be happy to remain a true fan. If you see RR, you'll lose all respect. I left the theater after 1 1/2hr - and nobody had even die by then? WTF?"
3,Rocknrolla is Ritchie slowly returning to form,"It took a while to get its feet off the ground, but this movie finally brings director Guy Ritchie back to what he's good at: contemporary British gangster flicks. I was worried after seeing his stinker ""Revolver."" And while ""Rocknrolla"" still carries Ritchie's trademark style, it sees him going down a slightly skewed path which promises to take his fans on an interesting ride. The movie especially pays off about half way through once all characters are well established. From the ending, there's a teaser that the characters will return in a sequel. It'll be interesting to see what Ritchie has planned (possible trilogy?)."
3,Not His Best Work,"Let me say that I liked Lock Stock & Two Smoking Barrels and loved Snatch. However, this movie leaned more into a light action/very light comedy mode. It had a very slow pace, I don't really recall any real laughs or tense moments. Just a director telling us all a story.The picture and audio was fine, not that it mattered.However, I think I was expecting more of a dark comedy. There was no Turkish, no Bullet-tooth Tony, just some people screwing each other.I didn't give it a low score, because it wasn't bad, it's just I didn't really care what happened to any of the characters.My suggestion is to definitely rent it first. If you like the genre, I'd suggest the two aforementioned movies or maybe Layer Cake."
3,Gee! I missed this one at the Theater...,"An enjoyable viewing of a movie I missed in the theater, but enjoyed via Amazon's VOD. Not for everyone, but wow!"
3,Solid,"Got here quickly, solid movie and I was happy with the way it was packaged and handled overall. Could have been quicker."
4,RocknRolla hits it,"I like Guy Ritchie movies (except Revolver) and this one delivers. Like ""Lock, Stock & 2 smoking barrels"" & ""Snatch"" a good cast with a move around story line. Choice."
3,a bit disjointed and feels a tad too long,"A cast of intriguing stars portrays a cast of interesting characters that come together into one smashing resolution. If everything is so intricate and so intertwined why does it feel boring, drawn out, and entire too long? The fact of the matter is that although there are interesting characters and great actors (Mark Strong, Tom Wilkinson, Gerald Butler, Thandie Newton, etc.) there is simply too much going on for the audience to care. The characters are all flawed in various ways and that's what makes them watchable. I wish the movie would focus more on exploring their flaws and mistakes than try to roll towards an unachievable goal."
4,a good basic guide,"this book has alot of basic information as well as scenarios. you might not use the exact situation they diagram out, but through them you will see most of the situations you will run into, and how to wire it."
5,Indelible ink reminds us of our own childhood adventures,"This book is a series of wonderful vignettes, beautifully written, that remind us of times, places and events in our own lives.Those who like myself were late baby boomers (late fifties, early sixties), will find some of the descriptions to be a bit before our time. But the neighborhoods of the sixties, the toys we played with, and even my experiences with siblings and family members came rushing back as I read this book.I finished it in one sitting. And therein lies my only complaint. I haven't yet seen a sequel."
2,Ehhh...,"Dissapointing. Really nothing to it. Being a horror fan and hearing so much about this movie, I expect a little more gore."
1,too strange and slow,"Im glad I didn't pay for this and it was a free prime video. It was not my cup of tee. I enjoyed movies like Hostile and Saw....but this did nothing for me. Very slow developing plot, too many "" flash backs "" in the movie that it started to distract me. What a waste of 2 hours of my precious time."
2,Overrated,"Audition is a film that relies heavily on the last twenty minutes of its running time. In the first eighty minutes there is only one, but good, scare. Otherwise this is a fairly tedious film that has very little emotion, for which the director is to blame. On imdb.com this film is given a 7.3/10 rating. I feel that this film deserves more of a 4/10 rating, becasue it really is boring. The amazon.com review states that this film will stay with you long after you have seen it, but that doesn't necessarily mean that it is good. This film relies on the violence towards the end of the film for its substance. This violence too is ridiculous, just like the rest of the film, which is not really a true horror movie. I am not a person who rejects violence; I like movies like The Wild Bunch, Kill Bill Vol.1 and Evil Dead, because those movies actually had something to go with the violence. I don't recommend this film unless you are a true horror fan or you are just curious."
3,DISGUSTING,But how lush to sit through this movie. It's a pretty decent flick. But it's way too out there for my taste. It's stomach turning and at the very least will make you throw up. It's worth watching though. Forget about all other reviews and go ahead and watch this movie.
3,Long,Wes Craven said this was one of the scariest things he had seen so I bought it. There are some scary/insane parts but mostly it's a bore in between the crazy which are very short parts.
4,helps to understand the meaning of not having a relationship with everybody!!,"nice movie,not like dirty stupid Hollywood movies!!!not that scary, it is definitely worth watching.... . . ."
3,Great plot slow story line,"This was a killer flick, but not exactly what I anticipated. I continuously found myself longing for the end to come ASAP...Because I knew this is where the actual gore and horror would begin. Once it started it was a bone wrenching experience. I definitely would have rated this movie higher if there were a few more gorish things throughout the movie. What ever you do don't rent this with your first date."
5,Movies don't scare me. This one scared me.,"It's a pitty that this movie is so horrific, because it's actually quite good. Unlike Ichi, which hid a mediocre movie beneath a display of things that nobody in their right mind wants to see, this movie just plain worked.It starts off innocently enough. The plot gets interesting, we're getting to know our amiable characters, the cinematography is great, the dialogue is nice, then WHAM.It suddenly becomes the scariest movie I've ever seen. Nothing else can even compete. It actually came in at number eleven in ""scariest movie moments"" on some cable TV show about horror flicks. I think they left it at number eleven because they were affraid if it were rated higher people would actually see it and sue the network.If you call your cat like I used to, opening the back door and going ""kittykittykittykitty!"" You'll never do that again after seeing this film. Egad."
4,I never want to see this movie again!,"Don't get me wrong; the movie is great. The directing, the acting, the script, all first rate. A brilliant work.Its just too creepy! I was truly disturbed by it. I felt almost betrayed by the cast and director to some malignant plan that had manipulated my sense of expectation.I saw it once. It'll be in my head until the day I die."
3,Creepy,"Well at first I thought this movie was plain boring. But like most people felt after the audition you did just get a bad feeling right away with this girl, I mean the creepy waiting around for him to call just freaks you out. The movie to me seems some what confusing but very interesting the way it plays out and how it ends is something that I personally did not see coming. I recomend it if you don't mind kinda slow movies with strange plots."
4,"Not AWESOME, but not TERRIBLE","I really liked this movie. It does take a looooooong time for the madness to start, but once you realize there's a much deeper plot going on, you kind of accept it and just start to watch the movie. Sometimes the romance gets a bit sappy, but I think the last few minutes are totally worth it, especially because you do end up identifying with Aoyama. Actually, I felt for the girl too but I'll let the movie describe exactly why.Don't go into it expecting the plot to take off right away, you'll be disappointed. Just watch and pick up as many subtle hints as you can along the way, and let the movie speak for itself."
5,"If you have a Computer Science background and just starting with PERL, this is the book for you.","Like my title of the review reads, if you have computer science background and just starting with PERL, this is the book for you. It teaches PERL the way computer science people are taught programming languages like C, FORTRAN etc. Starts with basics and proceeds in systematic and logical way. It is an easy read and will get you up and running in less than 2 days."
2,only a book just for beginners at most,"The book is good in writing, and covers major perl languages for programming.However, after reading the book and comparing against other books/trainings, I find this book lacks in-depth examples about perl. It has not covered a lot of principals, nor why and how to use perl when there are multiple choices.I would not recommend this book even to beginners as you will encounter a lot of issues, and you will spend more time on searching beyond what is taught in this book..It is more like a compact perl dictionary, but lacks explaining why and how to use in examples."
5,runner67,"This is an excellent book that will open the eyes of anyone whoever thought they could trust the Atomic Energy Commission. The author takes us through many of the horrible things that happened to the people and livestock in Utah who lived down wind to the atomic tests. Likewise, he tells how the AEC covered up actual causes of the illness and cancers that resulted from the tests. The book also opens our eyes to the fact that so called ""safe"" underground tests are not safe and can be just as contaminating as above ground tests. Anyone who lived or still lives in Nevada or Utah should read this book."
2,not for wide feet,I'm sure these are awesome--especially if you are vegan--but don't buy if you have wide feet!! The toe box is very small.
2,Different,"Size chart doesn't seem to include socks! My pair fits good barefoot, but not with socks. If you need to wear socks with them, go up a size. The sole is rounded slightly so is not that great for balance postures. I use, but probably won't purchase another pair."
3,Field guide? more like a short trip...,"A field guide may be a quick and helpful orientation to the wilderness, but ultimately leave you lost. As someone who is newly diagnosed with diabetes, I wanted all the information I could get about diabetes, its treatment, and suggestions for coping with it. This book left me with more questions than answers. I'd say if you want to help your friends and relatives understand diabetes, this book may be helpful, especially if they have short attention spans. But I wouldn't recommend it for someone who is headed off into the wilderness of learning about diabetes and needs a reliable guide that can help you cope with unexpected dangers."
3,Good for the money,"This dresser took some time to put together. Beware the different sizes of the screws, etc. They don't separate them and I had to take a few things apart to finish it properly. I'd like to see the overall dresser a few inches taller, must be meant for kids. The drawers don't line up perfectly, but then again, it's ok for the price."
2,6 drawer dresser,"Once you get this together it is ok. However be prepared to receive the item with parts damaged. The product ships from Vancouver Canada and even though it is packed well nothing will survive the shipping to the east coast. Prepac is very good about sending out replacement parts but each time you order parts it takes another week to receive them and some of the replacement parts arrive damaged, so add another week to get parts. I ordered 3 items from prepac via Amazon and it took over a month to finally get the all of the undamaged parts to finally get the items assembled."
3,Just ok.,I intially wrote a terrible review because I was not using it correctly. Then I realized I needed to hook the dryer behind the stand holder. Now it holds the dryer well. However the extender does not stay stiff and you cannot really adjust the height. The extender just stays down at the lowest height. But it basically is ok.
3,dryer stand,"OK--does the job. Could be a little stronger to hold heavier hair dryers--tends to ""wilt down"" in certain positions. And the base needs to be a bit heavier to counterbalance the weight of the dryer. But if you get everything in exactly the correct position, it will work."
2,Disappointed,"The stand does not work after just 2 weeks. Easy set up, great price but when you extend the tube, it does not stay in place. Chaep product, great idea though."
4,Dryer Stand,"Directions for setup were poor. Had to drill out a screw that broke when I inserted into wrong place, but eventually got it right and now works well."
4,Hairdryer stand,I am very pleased with the product. I am not totally used to it yet but the nicest thing about it is that the base is heavier enough to hold the hair dryer without turning over which is what a lot of them do -- I have heard. It is also a height that I can actually put it under my sink if I choose to instead of leaving it out all the time. I am pleased with the purchase.
1,Hands free hair dryer stand,"I do not recommend this item. It has a clip that is suppose to hold the dryer. It doesn't hold very well. My hair dryer has fallen several times now. This item is too heavy to return...I'm stuck with it,"
3,no good,"cheap, cheap, cheapcheap, cheap, cheapcheap, cheap, cheapcheap, cheap, cheapcheap, cheap, cheapcheap, cheap, cheapcheap, cheap, cheap cheap, cheap, cheap cheap, cheap, cheap this is a heapo crap"
3,It's a hair dryer stand.,I bought this hair dryer stand for my girlfriend to replace the one she broke (don't ask me how) which was identical. It does what it has to do.
4,hair dryer stand,This hair dryer stand is exactly what I wanted. I needed something to hold the hair dryer while I dry my Yorkshire terriers' hair. This is ideal. I am so well pleased with it that I use it when drying my own hair. It is heavy enough that the hair dryer does not tip over.
1,Garbage,"This Item is garbage. It is not strong enough to hold most blow dryers, the clip is not large enough, the bendable part of the pole is week. Mine broke in 2 weeks. complete junk!"
2,Hands Free Adjustable Hair Dryer Floor Holder Stand-as Seen on Tv,It was not very helpful. Hair dryer kept falling toward the ground. Great concept if it was more sturdy around the top where the hair dryer is placed.
2,Hair Dryer Stand,I would like it if it were sturdier but it does the job and helps me to clear my vanity. I am satisfied.
1,Do not buy,"It is a really nice concept and I wish it would have worked. The base is not stable enough to hold even my small travel size hair dryer without tippling over easily. After only a few uses, the bendable neck of the stand does not have enough strength to hold my travel size dryer without drooping, so it cannot be positioned to point in any particular direction... it points at the floor. Even if it did not tip over easy and even if the stand neck actually could be positioned to point the dryer in the direction wanted and maintain the position, it takes up too much space in my small bathroom when not in use. Not sure what to do with it as it clearly does not work as promised and hoped."
4,Helpful,"I found this book to be very helpful in that it is easy tofollow for student and parent. In our case, this was to beused as a review and it accomplished that. Our daughtersneeds were served but because she already knew the work,it did not challenge her so in all honesty I cannotgive a better assessment."
3,Good and in and in line with the series,"The stories fit and are in line with most of Man-Kzin War books, except the last story which drags in a part of the Ring World foolishness of the tree of life."
3,Harbinger 1250 is losing it's quality,"I have used Harbinger wrist wrap's (1250) for many, many years and will continue to do so. But the fact remains the quality is not nearly what it used to be. I work out 5 days a week and I rotate 3 pair of Harbinger 1250's so I never use one pair more than twice a week. Years ago a pair would last several months with minimal wear, now within 1 month the leather wears down to the point that the barbells actually slip from the glove, this has been happening for a good year and never happened previously. Most likely they are using a lower grade of leather. Insterad of buying a new pair every 6 months it's now every 3. But my options are limited...."
2,poor manufacturing,"i quess it's hard to find a quality made product (except for my own at: [...] ) anyway, the size was good, and the colors are nice, but for someone's who's been lifting for 10+ years now, i can't beleive the finger seams are coming apart AFTER ONLY 2 TRIPS TO THE GYM! Harbinger makes good straps, but that's all..i will repost when these totally fall apart- i go to crush it 5-6 days a week...so maybe see you soon!"
3,Product Design,"Doesn expect the color to be like that, dont really like em, but about the principal function of the training gloves, they re quite good. They really protect you."
2,Maybe not what you expected,"If you want to read a well written novel, this new Charles McCarry work, purportedly the last book about Paul Christopher, is worth while. McCarry is a fine writer. But if you are expecting a pulsating, clever spy story to take to the beach, don't believe a word of the publisher's blurb on the inside of the dust cover. It is not a thriller in any sense of the word and I dropped it well short of page 480."
5,The Landower Legacy the hard back book,"This is the book dreams are made of. It is absolutely wonderful! Suspense, lost & found love, mystery, it has everything. I will continue to recommend this book to everyone. Especially if you are looking for a book that you can read over and over again & never tire of, this is the book for you. If you are just looking for a book to retire at the end of the night w/ to ensure you have the most pleasant of slumbers, this is the book for you. Victoria Holt is a pure & genuine aurthoress and her book The Landower Legacy is certainly proof of that. It has become and will continue to be a book that is enjoyed by all walks of life & all generations, now & to come. Thank You Victoria Holt!"
2,Dumb and Nervy as well.,"Essentially the book is a rehash of the old creative financing techniques touted by the real estate gurus of the 1980's. And where are they now?With the exception of some updated techniques for the Internet, the approach is the same: 1. Find people with money. 2. Find sellers who want to dump their trashy properties, then put the two together.Since it always takes money to make money the whole scheme is dependant on your being able to find ""money people"".If there is any value in the book it is that it is a much cheaper way to get this type of info than having to buy the high priced infomerical stuff.True, there will be a few who will make their fortunes by buying fixer uppers at a discount but most copies of this book will end up with all the other ""real estate riches"" type books - selling for a buck or two at the used book stores."
5,Are You Ready to Become a Millionaire?,This is excellent book packed with powerful advice. You would be dumb not to read it and even dumber not to use it. I found this book easy reading and very helpful.
4,Good absorbent socks,"The socks were comfortable and very absorbent. Good product in my opinion.It just feels like it's going to fall apart after some time...a little flimsy, so don't think it can be passed down to siblings if that's what you are used to."
5,Excellent Laptop Case,"I have been using this case for several months now on a daily basis. It has held up excellently!I have a 15"" laptop, power cord, several adapters, wireless internet antennae, a hardcover book, several manilla files, tons of business cards, cash and checks, etc, all stuffed into the case - and I'm not using all the pockets!It's also very stylish, I've gotten several compliments on it. Mine appears to be slightly lighter than what is pictured.Overall, definitely a great way to carry a laptop, files and various business paraphernalia. Be advised, it's not a slim case, it does have some width. More of a laptop/briefcase than just a laptop case."
2,One Disc Damage,"I contacted the company and explain to them that one disc was damage , the one with the concerts on it, never got a reply.i give it 2 stars , the 2 stars are for Heroes del silencio , they deserve 10 , but the company deserves 0"
5,There are no words to describe Marc Anthony,"I have seen him in concert and this video is just a sample of what you could see. I am in awe with his voice ,he has got a tremendous talent. Each of his notes-- perfect,I have never heard him faulter. ""Nadie Como Ella"" and ""Hasta Ayer"" are my picks. His remake of ""Make it With You"",it's like the song was written with him in mind. Can't wait to see and hear more."
1,Its Blah,The story line was very predictable. I don't really have anything good to say about it except that the actors in this film have come along way from their acting in this film. They have gotten better.
1,Very Unhappy,"This order was placed on 12/17. And was supposed to be a Christmas present. This order did not even ship out Until 1/4. I have now had to apologize to the person who wanted this several times, and they think that they are not even getting it."
4,"great, but ...",My 4yo daughter LOVES this radio. I give it 4 stars instead of 5 b/c the 2 barbie stories have no volume control and are LOUD. We can hear it 10 yards down the hall in our bedroom when our daughter listens to it to go to sleep.One plus is the button to start the stories is easy to find and for a 4yo to push. The AM/FM radio and alarm settings are something an adult would have to do.The projector is adjustable so you can aim it right over the bed. The frame around barbie's picture lights up bright pink while the stories are playing.
2,disappointed,I purchased this item for my grand daughter. My son said it came in a plain box that had what looked like a photo copied picture of the item pasted on the box making it look very cheap. The story teller won't work at all. We are attempting to contact the seller Discounts Jungle and Emerson (who manufactures it) so see if we can find a resolution. Will post additional once we have (or don't get) a resolution.
4,Pretty good,"I am in a chorus that happens to be performing Bernstein's ""Chichester Psalms"" and Britten's ""Rejoice in the Lamb"" so it was quite fortuitous for me that this cd exists. I have quite enjoyed it since buying it. The chorus sings beautifully and on key (you'd be surprised to have to even say that); and I listen to the cd for enjoyment as well as practice."
2,SIMPLE and SMART?,"Whenever a business author uses as an acronym for the structure of a book, I cringe, this author uses two. It is a basic primer on SMART goals and it does try to offer a step by step guide to creating effective employee goals. The book is easy to read.However this book is too easy to read, each step is almost self-explanatory, and further explanation of the SIMPLE process is filler. There are no practical guides for determining goals. This is a book that tells you what goals should be and should not be. But if you know SMART you know this book."
1,Buyer Beware!,"I bought this product expecting the excellent results I have had from Delorme products for years.It's been a nightmare trying to get it to work.I have tried installing it six times on two different computers and I can't get it to plot a route. I put in a start and finish point and it plots a straight line between the two points.Others have had this same problem, as related on the Delorme forum, so it isn't just my computer, or my installation technique. Every other Delorme product I have bought has installed on this same computer with no problem.I have sent two e-mails to tech support and have not received any reply (after five days). On their forum I was told to follow the instructions for a so-called ""clean install,"" but when I followed them (three times!) I got the same result.I'm sending this obviously inadequately tested and bug-filled software back for a refund."
5,Thinking of a Startup...Don't miss reading this!,"The MouseDriver Chronicles is a book without a match...at least for now. Very special in that it describes the nuts and bolts,ups and downs of a two entrepeneurs startup business.Unlike ""Do this , don't do that"" books this book just desrcibes and lets you draw the conclusions and lessons that most match your situation. I found myself identifying with many of John and Kyle's experiences as I am a past entrepeneur. It's really amazing how I would have changed the way I worked on that startup if I read this book at that time. Thanks to John and Kyle, it inspired me and motivated me just as John promised."
4,Good introduction to Missouri fly fishing,"For new flyfishers or flyfishers new to Missouri, this little book (174 pages) is a real help. It includes many helpful pointers on fly fishing in general, with general information on equipment, techniques, and entomology, and with a great deal of information on specific Missouri trout streams"
3,Not all you need to know,"Basic stuff for the almost beginner. No info on complicated repairs or the simple stuff everyone is supposed to know. Don't lose your owner's manual, plub gaps, etc are not in this manual."
2,Prepare to expel (not suspend) your disbelief,"The only reason I'm giving this book two stars instead of one is because the writing (at the sentence level) is decent. But I found the plot to be SO out there, I couldn't get past it. First of all, living in LA and knowing quite a bit about the entertainment industry and the people in it, I can't believe for a second that any of this would ever happen...not the initial dinner invitation, not the conversations, not the judge's ruling, etc. Come on - when celebrities can get off on murder and rape charges, this guy is forced to spend three months in a stranger's home in the middle of nowhere? Also, if agents were really willing to dump their clients over their bad attitudes, 90% of Hollywood would be without representation. This book might work as a thirteen-year-old's wish fulfillment, but if you're over thirteen, don't waste your money."
5,Finally--chick lit in a rural setting!,"Because I thought the premise sounded mildly amusing, and the book was given to me, I picked up Mean Season a few weeks ago. I am so glad I did! I was expecting a light book and, when I read where it took place, I expected the typical annoying stereotypes of people in small towns. Not so. Though it at first seems light, the book actually deals with some interesting and important issues, such as finding your purpose in life, developing self esteem, treating others fairly, seizing the moment, and treating your family and friends with love and kindness. It even made me teary-eyed in a few spots. Despite all these layers, though, the book moved quickly and had many genuine laugh-out-loud moments. I heartily recommend Mean Season."
4,Dark and honest,"I completely disagree with the previous review. This movie is surprisingly effective and professional for an independent movie which has gotten very little press. The acting is quite good, and the writing is strong. Definitely not the most entertaining movie to watch, but how could it be? This is not a feel-good type flick; it is about loss, pain and people growing apart. I found the relationship between the two siblings particularly touching, and was very moved by the believable meltdown Hattie experiences after suffering a miscarriage. Her acting reminded me of Kirsten Dunst in Melancholia. I give it a four, because I think fives are for the likes of Almodovar and Truffaut. I highly recommend this movie if you have two hours to spare and enjoys relatable characters that portray life and relationships as they really are."
2,short life span,i bought this as it was a good deal....had it for a year and 3 weeks and its in the trash now...mine too was quiet in the beginning ....now its making a deafening noise amd something is burning in the motor.....my hub looked it over and said its shot...i have an 8 year old hoover thats doing a better job then this did
2,It's trash!,"I bought this vacuum 5 months ago and it is already ready for the trash! I just brought it to my local vacuum repair shop,(thinking something minor was wrong) and I was told it needs a new motor! It would cost more to fix than it was worth! It pays off in the end to spend the extra money and buy a nicer vac!"
4,Fun For The Whole Family!,"I wasn't sure what to expect when I rented this. It had good reviews but since it covered a ""tour"" I wasn't sure how. I liked Katy Perry but now I love Katy Perry. She came across as very sincere and down to earth, a good role model. You were also able to see the strain the career caused in her life which is important so that kids who have the same goals can see it isn't easy."
1,good but what?,"I really loved the movie and I expected to because I am a mega Katy Perry fan. It was very inspiring and it was a really great movie. But what bugged me was that i spent about $35 on it and what I got in the mail was the movie in a cracked case. What really bugged me more was that it says clearly on the back ""special features"" with the blu-ray disc, but when I look through the main menu, I find nothing but settings, scenes, and the movie. I feel I should be getting a refund for that because I didn't get all that I paid for."
1,This is a documentary not a movie,This was listed as a movie not a documentary. We did not even watch it. Would request our money back.
3,"Eh, it as ok.","Kind of boring at times, but I did enjoy the music parts of the documentary/movie. It was nice to see that she is a true person."
5,Wonderful,"A very good package with a nice combo and a great movie, even if you don't like the songs, but if you're a fan this film is beautiful.Very emotional in some parts, it's a testment to everyone pursuing your dreams."
5,Surprised!,I always liked Katy Perry's music and now like it even more as well as appreciate Katy Perry as a person and not just some famous artist. Great movie!
5,"beautiful movie, i cried my eyes out.",It was a complete look inside her life and very sad. I wish it would have worked for her with Russel.She is a true performer.
5,Wonderul,I have been looking for this book for some time... It was in great shape and just what I was looking for at a super price.
2,If you Miss the 90's Buy it.,Do not buy this unless you really have to. It's outdated with very old info for 2011. It was probably great for 1994. I miss the 90's.
1,Casinos love this book,"First of all, any book that suggests that a casino game with a house advantage can be beaten with any system must be regarded with suspicion. This book makes such claims, and in addition argues that the math performed by countless statisticians does not apply using his strategy.The author's recommended strategies are poorly worded, and make little sense even after he explains them. My favorite example is after he describes his blackjack system where you raise bets when you lose a hand and decrease bets when you win. He then argues that this system works because you lose less during a losing streak and win more during a winning streak.I'm still trying to figure out exactly how that one works....maybe if I turn the book upside down it will make more sense."
3,3 Heels for Blood Brothers,"Book three, Blood Brothers. I think this was my favorite of all four books. There wasn't much ""filler"" that I had to skip over, which is good, because I HATE paying for a book, then having to skim through it. But anyways! Lucy has to figure out exactly what/who is constantly following her, and attacking people in the town while helping Jared and wondering if she SHOULDN'T be helping him...he showed up out of the blue and wants no one to know he is there. Who is Jared? Jared is Byron's brother that no one knew about. My full review at: www(dot)shoe-girl(dot)com"
5,Wonderful,This is one of Mel Brooks best movies. It ranks right up there with Blazing Saddles and Young Frankenstein and has a host of cameos by some of the top comedians in the world.
4,One of Brooks better efforts.,"While not on the same level as Young Frankenstein or even Blazing Saddles, it's still a fun romp thru history!"
1,Surprised it didn't work well at all.........,"After reading the online reviews from people who absolutely love this product I am confused! What are they doing differently than I am? I found this product a complete waste of time and money. It doesn't do a good job on my tile and it is horrible on my laminate wood flooring. I have tried everything and I always have to re-clean the tile (it never gets it very clean) and it leaves horrible streaks on the laminate. Every once in awhile I drag it back out and try again, but it really doesn't do a good job at all. All in all, I am very disappointed."
2,difficult to assemble,"while this item should be a ""no-brainer"" to assemble, on my new unit the telescoping wand did not work...I did follow the instructions to the letter--just no telescoping action--I called the toll free number and they wanted to give me a list of repair shops--I said ""sorry"" I just got it home and now I have to cart it down a flight of stairs and back to the car to return it--no I just didn't feel like driving 70miles to the nearest repair place and then waiting a week or two--why can't manufacturers get it right what happened to quality control??--I did use it to see how well it worked--stooped over in the kitchen with my two foot non telescoping handle--it did seem to clean my tile floor and would have been better than squeezing out a mop--didn't do a great job on the grout--only held 12ounces of water but that was enough to do two small tile floors (140 sq ft) and a small area of hardwood floor on the 12ounces. Janis, Ithaca NY"
1,pack of rubbish,"The ""dialogue"" in this book is pure trash. Even a cursory comparison between the Bible, God's Word to mankind, will expose Walsch's pitiful attempt to hold himself up as a ""messenger for God"".The book is rubbish and this author is accomplishing nothing more complicated than deception. He is hoping that you are too lazy to make the comparison for yourself, that you will accept his word as ""gospel"" to further degrade your life and that you will make him wealthier along the way. This book is base secular humanism."
1,Conversations with Whom????????,"Actually, I enjoyed reading this book. Had it been called ""Conversations with God: a Totally Iimaginary Dialogue"", I probably would have given it a 5 star rating. I don't know who Mr. Walsh was talking to, but I doubt that it was God . . . still, I enjoyed eavesdropping on the conversations."
1,this book is garbage,"WOW I have read the first few pages and this guy isnt ""conversating with God, hes talking to satan himself. Any one who tells you to rely on your feelings is the biggest deciever ever!! Our feelings are fleeting up and down. Jesus Christ is the Rock that never changes. Thank goodness He didnt go by His feelings when he was dying on the cross for our sins. This book is a big fat LIE!"
5,Great Book,"I loved this book. I just knew somewhere deep down inside that God would not even considered roasting or barbequing his children for making mistakes. As C. A. Lewis points out in An Encounter With A Prophet ""why would God make us imperfect and then punish us for being imperfect."" Let the fundamentalists rave on I have found a God of unconditional love. Thanks to both authors."
2,"Neale bowls a spare, not a strike!","Even the devil can quote scripture eloquently. (How else was Jesus tempted in the wilderness?) Neale wanted to write a book, so he did. He needed the money. Are there TRUTHS here? Yes, but that is a credit to mind and reason that God has given mankind, not to Neale's blatherings. TRUTH is TRUTH regardless of the author or how he was inspired. To the extent that this book makes you THINK, or examine your faith and beliefs, then it is useful. But Divine Writings of the Almighty through Edgar Cayce-like ""automatic writing""? Baloney! Read it for insight only; read The Holy Bible for your salvation! But love Neale anyway as God commands that we love each other. Just take Neale with a very liberal grain of salt!"
1,TRUTH,"Not His Truth. This book is the author's opinion. See the Bible for answers to your questions. Not some man's opinions. Do not be deceived into the ""pick & choose religion"". Seek God's Truth through scripture. Jesus is The Way. No one comes to The Father except through Me"". Live according to God's Word, not by man's. Otherwise you will not be on the road to life, but to the very depths of Hell. ""Choose this day whom you will serve""."
1,Unadulterated heresy,This series is New Agism co-opting Judeo Christian doctrine. This is not God answering questions because anyone who understands the truth of the Bible knows God would not answer many of the questions with such morally relative pablum.I warn all Christian (and non-Christian) parents to avoid this series at all costs.
5,An uncommon dialogue.,"Conversations with God, book 1, is indeed a very uncommon dialogue that will make you feel great about yourself since it allows you to discover who you really are. I feel it is the ultimate ""manual of instructions"" for life. It should be offered to all newborn babies at the baby shower, and to the parents to help them understand life better and be better parents. This also is the greatest tool to achieve the most intense personal growth ever. Reading it is very convenient since you can refer to the index at the end of the book, therefore choosing which subject you wish to explore. Happy reading! Happy you!"
3,God Not Acknowledged,"The author acknowledges numerous people and sources in his ""Acknowledgments"" section as the book opens but fails to acknowledge ""God"" - even though the book is titled ""Conversations With God"" ... A gimmick ? Yes But drips pearls of ""Wisdom"" nonetheless.Cash in old boy - well done !"
4,Gives a new perspective to the New-Age,"Well, there will be Christains, Muslims and People of The Book who might find this book blasphemous. But who are we to decide what blasphemy is? This book explores the age-old wisdom that we all know but not always remember. And through that process also gives a new perspective for the New Age. Walsch may not be a prophet, nor does this book make tall claims to guide us. However, the singular achievement or some will say drawback, of the book is that the Fear of the God diminishes without in anyway affecting the belief. At the end of it however, it raises as many questions as it seeks to answer. And finding answers to those eternal questions is what Karma is all about I believe."
1,"""Offending Little Ones""","May God help us as we watch this nation go up in flames with books on the market like this! This book is being pushed on school children through the Scholastic Book Club and with the endorsement of none other than Oprah Winfrey. Dr. James Dobson is up in arms--and rightfully so!! I haven't had a chance to read all the reviews, but just in case someone hasn't already quoted a relevant (real) Bible verse, I'd like to do so myself: ""But whoso shall offend one of these little ones which believe in me, it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and that he were drowned in the depth of the sea."" Matthew 18:6."
4,One man's God is another man's Devil...,"I will start by saying that I loved the first two books in this series. I definitely like Neale's God. Although, I have to admit that many of his concepts go totally against everything I've ever learned about the Christian God, I am lured by his version of ""the truth."" Satan's messenger perhaps? The Great Trickster at work? Who knows? But, it is damned entertaining to imagine that God is this Liberal! I recommend this book for anyone on that eternal quest for spiritual balance! Allah be with you! did I spell that right? :-)"
1,Not Good,This book goes against everything the Bible teaches. This guy must be CRAZY!! (Or desperate...)
2,Hmmm...,"I'm not sure what to make of this book. I honestly don't know if it's real or not. I know that God does indeed talk to those who listen and those who want it, but He isn't crude like this book makes Him out to be."
4,Time to wake up and smell the holy water....,"This book really opened my eyes to the misconceptions of my Catholic upbringing. The image of a vindictive, punishing God were shown to be totally false. I am in charge of my own destiny due to my God-given freedom of choice. After reading this book, most will see that NOTHING is impossible because God gave us the tools at birth to create our own reality. (If you can dream it, you can live it.) The straight-laced, intimidating religious teachings of years ago are given a true run for their money. If you want to break through all the ""crap"" drummed into you as a Catholic (or any other organized religion) child, this is the book for you. For anyone who feels inadequate, ineffective, untalented, and insecure, this is definitely the book for you. Open your mind to the possibilities, and you will find that the only things standing in your way, are your own fears. You have the ability...you've always had it. Break free with the help of this book."
5,NEW AGE TRASH,"After reading the Gospel according to Neale Donald Walsh (Book 2), I was convinced this was not of God. If Hitler went to heaven, I don't think that's where I want to go when I die. The only good part about this book is when Neale talks about sharing. He quoted a scripture from the Bible in which Christ was telling the wealthy man to sell all that he had and give it to the poor. I've been wondering ever since if this is what Neale will do. Huh Neale????"
2,not as good as the first,"The first book kept reaffirming in my mind all that in fact, I already knew but was afraid to face up to. Reading it was a life changing experience for me. To get through the second book I needed to keep reminding myself that, as Walsh explains, God speaks to each of us through the filter of our own existence. Therefore, the word of God to me may be very different from the word of God to Walsh, with his filter tinted by his own life's experience. I needed to remind myself of this as the book frequently became preachy and political. Does God have such a left wing bias? Maybe so, I mean it's not hard to imagine God wondering what we humans are thinking as we foul his creation with our effluent - but I hardly needed this book to tell me that. If you've read book one, quit while you're ahead."
3,Conversations with God,Someone supposedly communicating directly with God fails to ask the big question - what happens when we die. Everything else is just talk.
2,"God doesn't know the difference between ""infer,"" and ""imply.""","I picked up this book in the library, read a few pages, and thought it was pretty cool...until I read a passage in which God misuses the word ""infer,"" when he should have used the word ""imply.""My God has better control of his grammar than the author's God does."
1,A total and utter fabrication.,"This book is a total and utter fabrication designed to deceive the masses into believing in the discredited doctrine of moral relativism. This shallow attempt to discredit the New Testament offers the naive, narcissistic and hedonist ""new age"" crowd a huge bone of lies and half-truths all credited to a God who writes suspiciously like an author trying to posit a ""new world order"" (world government) which condones greed, immorality and a denial of the truth of Christianity. The book seems to embrace concepts of A Course in Miracles, but then goes on to distort them into an anti-Christian and relativistic sham. This book has inspired me to get my views out on paper in my book to be titled The Practical Guide to Real Christianity, in order that some folks might see the error of ""new age"" frauds such as Walsch."
1,"Was Jesus a liar, then?","If Walsch's conversation is with God, then Jesus is a liar, because Walsch contradicts him all over the place. If Jesus is God, then he can't lie. If he isn't God, then the whole world is in a hopeless pickle. You better hope Walsch was talking to someone other than God.How is it that you can throw out the book that has been documented and verified throughout 2 millenia, the book that hundreds of people have died for, on the basis of a silly question and answer book that claims supernatural origin? If God spoke through the prophets in the Bible, then he didn't speak through Walsch, because God can't contradict himself. If God didn't speak through the Bible prophets, then why did he bother to speak through Walsch after all these centuries of silence? The next question Walsch should ask ""God"" is, ""Why didn't you ever talk to anyone before now?"""
5,Spiritualy Uplifting,"These books are exactly what I've been searching for. Nothing before has ever given me such truth, I am now afraid of nothing, feel I can deal with anything and most of all,have the tools to make the most of this life. For anybody who ever wonders about God, this book is your answer. However, I'd encourage anyone with an open mind to read CWG."
2,You are in charge of Your own destiny...,"You may wish to be in charge of your own destiny and skip this book. This is the 7th book review from the CORBEL Book Club.Some comments from our group were: ""It helped bring clarity to my life"" ""It helped with relating to others and building relationships"" ""Thought provoking""Mostly it was very confusing with a lot of double talk and contradictions. The author seemed schizophrenic talking to God (and God says: sometimes God is cool? - what's that supposed to mean?) this book went against the views of Christianity that the members of our group were raised with and believe in. The end of the book was very disappointing - clearly it is the authors intent to just sell books and memberships to his ""organization"".If something good could be said about this book, I guess it forced some of us to read a book that we otherwise would not have done...and it was short."
3,Practical Self-Help,"Walsch expounds on the negative role of guilt in our lives and emphasizes the importance of of being compassionate with ourselves. Basically, God wants us to follow that which is the highest good within us. The ""God"" Walsch communes with is a good natured, universalist that likes to kid around. The book is mainly a ""best of"" New Age/Eastern philosophical reasoning, using a dialogical format (question - answer). It shouldn't be mistaken as a literal encounter between man and the Creator of the Universe unless the reader already equates God with the subconscious processes and accumulated knowledge of the author."
4,Excellent and easy to read.,This book fills in many oif the missing pieces of the jigsaw of life. It is easy to read and very insightful.
2,"You had a little smokey of peyote, Nealey babe?",I give this book 2 stars because it has generated so much conversation around the world. Which means we're THINKING.
1,I'd like to hear God talk while Neale drinks a glass of water,"I heard God talking to Neale, too, one day. God was saying, ""Neale Neale bo beale, banana fana fo feale, fee fi mo meale NEALE!"" Oh, wait a second. That might just have been Neale singing to himself in the shower.On a serious note, this book is a joke. Unless you particularly like the notion of a dimbob God who talks at you in lame 1970s era cliches and pseudo-metaphysical babble, don't waste your time. This God couldn't think his way out of a paper bag. I'm not about to hand him my life."
1,Conversations with My Wallet,"I had a long talk with my wallet. After reading some of this at a friend's house, my wallet told me that I shouldn't buy the book.Why is it liberals make fun of people who try and serve God, even mock them with ""And God talks to you directly?"" types of comments and it's fine, yet one of their own claims to have God speaking directly to him and he's lauded as someone enlightened and wonderful. Just like everything else, the double standard is alive and well with them.Hopefully the author will recognize that's not God's voice whispering to him before it's too late."
1,itchy ears here what they want to hear,"if this book is all it takes to make people feel wonderful about their lives, I can top it! I'll just write a book that says everything we do is fine, there is no right and wrong, never judge others actions, and that we all are God. Hey, wait a minute, that pretty much sums up Conversations with God doesn't it? If this book is truth...then the Bible is a complete fraud and a lie... you decide."
5,Infinite Wisdom in Finite Form!,"Simply put. This is the most insightful book I have ever read. Maybe it was god or maybe it wasn't but the wisdom in this book will change your life, it changed mine. I definitely plan on reading books 2 and 3."
1,Disturbing,"Don't judge this book by it's title. The information given is not from The Bible but written to be ""politically correct""."
5,Returning to childhood innocence,"As I grew up, I was always told to use the good sense that God gave me. At the same time, I was also told not to question what the church told me to believe about God. This caused terrible turmoil inside me for most of my life. What I was taught by the church did not match my inner feelings about a loving God. Nothing they taught me made sense, and I carried this conflict around inside me. 40 years later someone recommended I read Book 1. Before I finished the first chapter I had to put the book down because it was moving me so powerfully and I was sobbing. I sobbed at nearly every paragraph for three days, not because it was sad but because I was being joyfully released and I could hardly believe it. Finally, everything I felt as a child about a loving God was being validated in the words I was reading. The messages in this book gave me back to myself. I give this book my highest recommendation."
1,Buyer Beware,"I agree with one of the other reviews that if you are a Christian this book does go against some of the fundamentals that Christians embrace.I have the second and third books and in there he says that Hitler went to Heaven because death is not really bad. If you have no solid Christian doctrines than you might believe what the author says. We have no real way of knowing the truths of these books. Don't always assume it is true, but it can be interesting reading. Please just beware of what you read and absorb from these books. They are not total truths or doctrines."
5,Stop Judging,"Just a few lines to those ""wise heads"" out there: ""Stop judging! For anyone's truth it is sacred and must be respected"""
1,Balderdash!,"Sounds good by the title, but this is another New Age that offers nothing. I threw it in the trash the day I bought it."
4,Conversations With God: An Uncommon Dialogue (Book 1),It has changed my life. I can not read fast enough to get to Books 2 & 3.
3,God Speaks?,"Not sure I buy the premise of this book, that God speaks through the author. But, I have only read a few pages. Maybe it will get more interesting as I go along."
1,CHRISTIANS BEWARE,"This book cleverly uses ""God"" in its title, but it bashes organized religion is definitely New Age in nature. The author's conversations with ""God"" seem more like conversations with himself.Definitely a confusing book for those ""on the fence"" about religion. I urge you to pick up a copy of the Life Application Study Bible in the New Living Translation and read God's way for your life in an updated, easy-to-understand language."
1,Conversations with God : An Uncommon Dialogue (Book 1),"Mr. Walsch is another 50 year old (married 4 times!) who is cashing in on his own version of God. Like so many talk show hosts who think all roads lead to God, he is promoting just another of these New Age religion cults... Since so many people think these days that they can reinvent God without ever opening the bible, it makes sense that this man is making millions off of selling this sort of garbage. It is sad to see so many people get misled by this instead of reading the actual Living Word of God. If you want to read a bestseller that offers a lot more clarity and hope, borrow a good bible FIRST."
3,Delicious way to multiply?,"I found this book interesting and insightful. My neighbor just loved it...and didn't feel like parting with it long enough to let me read it, so I bought my own copy. I'm afraid to say I would not have bought it had my neighbor lent it to me, as I do not agree with my neighbor about it's wonderfulness. Toward the very end of the book... God says something like...""Didn't I create a delicious way for you to multiply?"" If that isn't a MAN speaking...than I haven't lived as a woman for 43 years! The author also came across as self-centered. I just read George Anderson's We Don't Die...I loved that book."
5,Ask and ye shall receive!!!,"Before I found CWG (or it found me) I was in a sort of existential no-man's land--not sure what life meant, or what I was here for. I remember praying for God's help at night when I felt particularly alone and hopeless. I remember the next day I opened a fortune cookie which said ""Your dearest wish will come true."" I took it as a sign, and loh and behold, here I am with, what I believe to be, a direct answer to prayer--this miraculous trilogy!!! There are no accidents in the universe!!! And CWG is evidence of this Great Truth!!!"
1,Led astray,"A wise man once wrote, ""Why search for the truth within you, for you are the one confused."" And this man is confused. Even as you read about his failed marriages and other disappointing encounters we see a man who is searching for the truth, yet he is reaching, and reaching until he grasps onto whatever he possibly can, which in his case still remains weird. I ask the honest reader of this book, ""If we are gods,"" as the author implies, ""and we just need to come to a realization of the truth, then what type of gods are we that we lack the knowledge, wisdom, and understanding to arrive at the truth instantaneously."" I would only recommend this book to people that need to know how to pray for people that are as misled as the author and those who form a religion around his writings."
5,The Truth about God...Finally!!,"I have read every one of Neale's books and they are all amazing! The human race was long overdue to have someone step out of the shadows of organized religion and all the fear-based theologies and finally bring the true nature of God to the forefront. You may not agree with everything said in Neale's books, and you don't have to. Simply take the concepts and apply them to your life and see what happens. No longer must we fear things like Hell and Satan, as this book makes very clear, we have made them both up. We created Satan and Hell in order to scare people into behaving as we would like them to behave, when the truth is God is ALL there is! He is in everything and works and moves through everything. Do yourself a favor and read his books, and when you're done, recommend them to everyone you know. They will thank you for doing so. ;)"
4,Too amazingly coincidental to be purely chance,"It's difficult to know when someone is truly inspired or if they are just truly gifted. Inspired, in this sense, meaning inspired by the Divine.Whatever the case may be, there's some good lessons, some thought-provoking dialogue and some wit and wisdom.I was introduced to this book during a flight to Chicago. The woman sitting next to me asked me a question, and I answered. Then she read me something that she had just read from the book, and I was astonished! I truly felt that my Higher Power had made contact with me through the woman I was sitting next to and the book she was reading. And she felt that her Higher Power had made contact with her through the words I said! Some things seem too amazingly coincidental to be purely chance!The book was worth buying and reading just to read what the woman read out loud to me on the flight to Chicago..."
2,False idols,"The review by Kalisa(below)is one of the most frightening things I have ever read, in part because it is so heartfelt. As a deeply religious person I find nothing in this book but manipulation and the ""feel good"" values of our consumer culture. We no longer ask what we can do to better serve God, instead we now ask what God can do for us. Finally, look at the way Kalisa ends her review. She refers to GODNEALE! Think about this before you enrich this man further. Beware the person who has all the answers."
4,Combats Addiction,"My daughter's multiple readings of the ""Conversations with God"" series was and is a major component and ally in what will definitely be her life-long struggle to ""not pick up"" drugs or alcohol. Who knows what may happen next but she has been sober for four years, and the series has visibly more than once rescued and maintained her sobriety. There will always be a copy for her in my house. She often gives hers to addicts she feels are trying to stop their habits.I have a little problem with some of the author's statements and wonder if sometimes he confused his own thoughts with statements from his conversations. For what the series has done for my daughter, however, this ""minor disagreement"" does not matter at all."
4,"Not as good as book 1, but still has some good questions.","I loved book one and went and bought book 2. The beginning was interesting, but I found myself skipping pages around the end. This book talks alot about politics which I found to be pretty boring. It is still and interesting book because of the questions it asks. I read reviews of people saying that these books are satanic. These books are not satanic. These books were not written for a religion, but for an open mind. I believe that satan is not peace, he is not about bringing the world closer to God, and satan is not about finding yourself. Its makes me sick how many Christians focus on Satan and give him so much credit. This is a good book that will allow you to think. And think for yourself."
5,Catholics won't like this... Because they're not allowed to.,"When the student is ready the teacher will come. Is it Walsch? No. It's God. (It always was). Did Walsch ""hear"" God? Who Cares.Many will have to lighten up to understand what this book is really trying to say. It's a must read for those asking questions that religion hasn't answered for them. Even traditional religions should softly ""hmmmm"" when encountering many ideas delivered by Walsch's conversations. If truth be known, many fellow congreationalists secretely yearn for the answers to the questions posed in CWG.I personally liked the books on tape series. Ed Asner delivers his part of the ""spoken word"" with a rich and power presence. Walsch delivers concepts that are eye opening and skin tingling. This is not a difficult read but some concepts are hard to swallow - like Hitler went to Heaven. Personally the idea of a non-existant Devil fit my philosophy pretty well. And the Tom/Mary in CWG2 was red hot. I can't wait for book 3!"
2,Would not recommend,I have moved away from New Age and would no longer recommend this bookfor that reason. I've found this book inconsistent with my faith.
1,An avid reader from Indonesia,"I also have the same questions that the writer asks in the book, but I don't think I found any of the answers in this book at all. I realise that this book is written by a man with his own entitled opinions, and i think this book is basically that: the writer's own opinions of what he thinks what God is. I respect his opinions but I don't agree with them.Last, I just want to let you know, regretfully I found no desire to finish reading the book. From now on though, before buying a book I will check out the book reviews on Amazon first so I won't be dissapointed again."
4,Conversations with God,"Very heavy reading,it speaks to the very essences of our being. It seems or feels very real and something to give great thought over."
1,New Age Claptrap,"It is so depressing to me that the ""Conversation with God"" books are so popular. This is what religion in America has come to? It is moral relativism at its peak as people flock to these books that take life situations, inject ""feel good"" euphemisms into all of them, and give God's stamp of approval for everything and anything. Hey, as long as we have self-esteem, everything will be okay!! How can people waste time on this new age claptrap when there are books by authors like Thomas Merton and Frederick Buechner just waiting to be read? These books take us on a meaningful faith journey with all of its struggles and incongruencies. Unlike ""Conversations with God"", they are full of the deepest explorations of faith and doctrine. This book is watered down religion at its absolute worst."
1,Read this book at your own peril,"Please, do not buy this Walsch writer's claim that he is conversing with God. It is pure nonsense. This book drives people away from the real truth, which lies in the Holy Bible. Read the Gospels about the resurrection of Christ. Remember that 11 disciples took Jesus' truth to the grave and never recanted. 'Conversations with god' has nothing to do with God, and probably has more to do with the once angel who wanted to 'be like the Most High'. The real path to fulfillment and happiness in life is Jesus Christ. That has been proven to me through personal experience. A year ago I would have loved to read 'Conversations', but since becoming born again I thank the Lord with the wisdom not to accept such words from false prophets."
1,A searching Christian's view,"I've always had a lot of problems with ""difficult questions"" and religion hence I decided to read this book in an attempt to answer some of them.I think the book strays too far from Biblical teachings and is also rather dangerous for anyone who is looking for excuses to do certain things that are ""wrong"".If these were real teachings from God I do not think it would have taken this long before the Word was spread to the world.I believe that there are certain matters that will not be reveled until the time is right and we as humans can never know everything until God has willed it so. Until then, we should just try to accept things as they are and live life with faith rather than rely on such teachings that are dangerous and morally dubious."
1,Hard to follow,"This book was recommended by a friend so I picked it up. But now I'm wondering what the heck my friend was thinking. To me, this book is horribly written with all of the ALL CAPS and Initial Caps throughout. This makes it difficult for me to understand what the writer is trying to get across to me.Along with what a previous reviewer commented on... the following text from the book:""In the beginning, that which Is is all there was, and there was nothing else. Yet All That Is could not know itself- because All That Is is all there was, and there was nothing else. And so, All That Is ... was not. For in the absence of something else, All That Is, is not.....In the absence of that which is not, that which IS, is not.Do you understand this?""I'm glad the author is understanding this because I sure as heck am NOT following. Makes me want to put the book down and go pick up a Stephen King novel."
1,"Obviously a regurgitating, money making machine.","Anything goes spirituality.......Just like every other spiritualist guru Oprah promotes: I'm alright, your alright, we're all alright. I'm a god, your a god, we're all are own gods,...collectively. yuk yuk"
3,"5 star concept, 2 star content","What made this book so successful was the concept behind it. The originality and audacity with which Walsch proclaims himself to be a divine messenger, must pique anybody's interest.However, I found that Walsch's God did not always click with me. Sometimes he said some pretty agreeable things but at other times he was obscure, repetitive and often outright contradictory. At best, the dialogue sparks off thought processes of your own about subjects which don't receive enough thought. But I would like to think that my God would reveal himself with greater clarity."
2,I'd try not to review it based on prejudices,"The reason for the 2 stars is because alot of the explanations are a rather rudimentary mix of what is pseudo new age Christianity and eastern mysticism, particularly Buddhism. Since the author is only exposed with those 2 areas of religious thought his 'GOD' is also limited to those areas of explanation.Where is Islamic teaching, Hindusim, Shintoism, Zarathustrans and the polemics of good old Greek and Roman philoshophy? His philosophy of 3s could well extend to the trimurthi of Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva.Other areas such as relationship could well be picked up from some Aunty Anne's website. My biggest dissapointment is that the author just wasn't persistent enough in drilling further into the questions. In summary, there isn't really anything new if you are already exposed to a wider range of religious thought."
1,hated this book,"This book absolutly disgusted me. Teaching there is no hell is absolutly rediculas! Why would Jesus teach us about Satan and Hell if there wasn't one. what wishful thinking. Every person is accountable for their sin, don't you dare think your not. The part that got me was that this guy tore apart christianity by explaining why catholicism is wrong...well guess what i can do that too, because cathlicolism teaches alot of stuff that is not true,(pregitory, limbo, worshiping saints, confessions. None of that stuff is in the bible!!) but christians teach and learn from the bible. Funny how this author had no scriptures to back up this 'there is no hell idea' I am so discouraged and pray people will not be mislead by this book based on a lie. READ YOUR BIBLE PEOPLE!"
5,Its simple really,"If you are an open minded person and try not to let your conditioning cloud your thoughts then you will be greatly pleased you read this book. If you are deeply analytical, or very religious, then you will have great difficulty here. The churches will absolutely loathe it, for it instantly shatters their world which so many millions believe is the truth. It must be unthinkable and blasphemy for them that the true prophet could converse to the masses through a lowly person such as the author of this book. For heavens sake, only god fearing men and women who preach in richly ornate churches, and belong to religions that for centuries have been corrupt can truly preach the word of god. It really is so simple, yet most of us will denounce this book, because if we don't, we will probably go to hell and sit forever polishing the shoes of a guy holding a pitch fork and has horns sticking out of his head, while we sweat profusely........shudder shudder."
5,This book validated what I had been receiving from my spirit,This book is my favorite read so far. While reading this book I cryed a little with tears of validation because this was exactly what I had been getting from my own spirit within. Prior to this I had not ran across anyone that had parallel perspectives with my own. This book was a God send for me. Thank you Neale Donald Walsh - and our God within. That really exists.
1,Too Far Fetched!,"Don't tell me, this author must have been raised a Unitarian! This has got to be the biggest load of bunk that's come along yet! You want to know God? Read His word, study with a good study guide like the ""Experiencing God"" or ""Precept Ministries"" series which take you verse by verse and let you learn the context of them. Then and only then, can you truly begin to understand God.Yes, there is a heaven and Satan does exist, and this is one author I'm sure I won't be seeing in heaven! Maybe, since God hasn't ever done this before, it's really Satan trying to win souls for himself that ""put"" all these ""answers"" in his head!"
1,Too bad there is not a zero rating.,"I can see why this book is so popular in the culture we live in (the USA). There is a no fault clause on whatever you decide to do. No sin, nothing offends God, we are perfect in what we do at all times. Do whatever feels good. This is a great book to share with your 14 year old son or daughter if you want them to be totally depraved. God is not as stupid as this author makes him out to be."
1,"Someone is talking to him, that's for sure","There is no doubt that someone is talking to this author, but it is not God. God does not contradict Himself. It's important to judge everything against the bible. If the content contradicts the bible--which this book does--there is something VERY wrong with it. Don't allow yourself to become confused by this author. Read your bible. Think critically."
5,It'll Make You or Break You...,"What I find so intriguing is how polarized the reviewers seem to be about this book: If you love it, you REALLY love it. If you hate it, it's in the trash, often along with harsh words to accompany it.I happen to be in the ""Love"" camp, not because of what anyone has written or told me about it, but because of what I felt as I was reading it. If feelings are the true language of the soul, then I heard a majestic chorus being echoed through mine as I absorbed what was being said.I know I am not alone. And neither will you be, if you find the courage to open the pages, let the Spirit speak to you and with an open mind and brave heart, see the God so many of Us are *finally* re-membering.So whether you decide to accept the Spirit of the message now--or later--God will be waiting and so will we ALL. Read the book. It'll make you--and break you--in the best possible way."
5,Terrifying! Magnificent!,"The first time I heard this, I was frankly terrified. Scott's love affair with melody and dissonance, his fragmented lyrics, his strident, passionate, yet somehow neutral, voice - all combine to create this masterpiece of dreamsongs. Now I can barely go a day without hearing it, and I often think of it longingly as I go through the day. Drift is a work worth obsessing over. 7 billion stars."
5,A Wonderful Soundtrack,"Too often it seems as if a soundtrack is a ""stand alone"" product to the movie. In the case of Glory Road, the soundtrack and movie brilliantly weaves the story of the Texas Western basketball team and the society it faced at home and on the road. Glory Road is by far the best sports movie produced for the big screen. The soundtrack should be a part of anyone's collection who not only has an appreciation of R&B, but who also wants to place the music chronicled in a historical context."
2,"Large print, small resource.","The book is easy to read, but there's not enough in it. It's missing so many everyday spanish words, I'm doing very basic stuff here but I have to keep going to the computer for help. Another big problem is if the word you're trying to translate from Spanish is an odd verb form, it not only doesn't list the word but won't even point you in the direction of the infinitive form as many other translation dictionaries (Oxford) do."
5,Gilbert & Sullivan Renewed.,If you love Gilbert & Sullivan you will love this CD. The package was new and sealed and arrived as promised. The music is beautiful. Would buy again from seller!
5,AWESOME!!!,"This cage is great! We just got it yesterday and put it together. Buster has investigated every possible nook and cranny and has determined there is no way for him to escape. There is so much room and it is VERY sturdy!!! We do only have 1 ferret, but there is room enough for at least 3 or more. The ramps are the only exposed wire that he walks on and we were worried about him getting his foot stuck in it, so we cut to-size strips from old pants and wove it between the wires. Now, there is no way Busters foot can get stuck and it's comfortable! I do want to find a cheap igloo or cube so he can have a dark place to sleep all day, but other than that it is totally AWESOME!!! I would highly recommend it and get it from Amazon! It's cheaper than going to the Midwest website and PetSmart. Also, the free shipping was great because it's almost 100 lbs. WOOT!!!!"
3,good for drivers,"makes car more tidy, good product except the zipper will make some noises when the ca is moving."
3,More soap opera than Revolutionary saga,"A notorious box-office disaster in its day, The Howards of Virginia (also known as The Tree of Liberty) is an engaging but curious colonial drama set during the American War of Independence with Cary Grant in Gunga Din rambunctious tearaway mode, which is a bit embarrassing when he overdoes it, which is often. The most surprising thing about Frank Lloyd's picture is that despite the amount of money and resources being thrown into it, the director clearly has no interest whatsoever in spectacle - hundreds of extras are featured in battles, parades or crowd scenes that are dismissed in a single establishing shot as if he wanted to hide their presence and get back indoors to his stars. Still, it's an entertaining enough saga. No extras on the DVD at all."
2,If it weren't for Cary Grant...,"If it weren't for Cary Grant, I would never have finished watching this video/film. I was bored by the lack of character development, but Cary Grant's smoldering presence makes the movie worth seeing once."
1,"Bad simplistic valve, overpriced for what it is","The valve turns 90 degrees from full bypass to full stop.Kind of.In fact it is a primitive make of the infamous kind, where a turn of (say) 80 degrees brings almost no change, remaining 8 degrees controls from 100 to 40 percent of the flow, and the tiny touches to the dial in the remaining 2 degrees choke the 40 of the flow to zero. Not a very sophisticated product. For 10 cents or even less I would have accepted it without saying a word. But with this price in my opinion stay away from it if you can. Take rather one of the adjustable heads with a more diversified control of the flow."
2,Let the buyer beware,I am a Plastic Surgeon and thus very interested in the subject matter. The The Text is actually very good but you will be cheated with the online access. 1. access is slow. Elsevier has not fixed this problem since it was brought to their attention last summer. 2. There is a floating copyright notice that moves over the illustrations. This is incredibly annoying and distracting. 3. You will only be allowed to access the Online Edition from two different computers. What good is that if you work in six or seven different locations. 4. You will not be allowed to export any illustrations for use in teaching etc.The content is good but the way the Online Edition has been managed borders on fraud!
5,Build and Play,"We bought the power sweeper after buying one of Rokenbok's starter sets - the Construction and Action Set. What's different about Rokenbok is the fact that you can build for hours and then play with remote control machines like this power sweeper for days. My son used to be a big fan of Lego - he will build really intricate, cool spaceships and cars but once that was done - he would just take them apart and start over again (or they would make it to his closet shelf). With Rokenbok, he likes the remote control aspect because he can build a cool scene such as a construction zone and then he will use the power sweeper to pick up balls and actually play with his creation! Very cool products from Rokenbok!"
2,Beginners ONLY!! Not much of a workout.,"Definately for the beginner!! I bought this thinking it would be a fun way to exercise. This was not even a workout for me. I am by no means in shape. But I am up moving all the time at work and at home. I get easily bored with your basic workout videos and was looking for something different. Not hip hop as I would think. If you are someone that is looking for something as an alternative to walking or something simple like that then this would work for you, but if you are looking for a real workout look somewhere else. I ended upgetting Billy Blanks Tae-Bo Cardio workout and THAT was a workout. I don't want to say this is a bad video because it's not, it just is made for certain people and it wasn't for me."
3,"good, could use more added features",Bought the Logitech cordless desktop LX710 and now I am sending it back. Easy to set up and start using. 2 things for me. Mouse was to small for me. Not that I have big hands but after a while my hand started to bother me. 2nd thing The cap lock-no light or anything to show you are using CAPS or not. Usually not a problem but when you are typing a password-case senitive-no way of telling it was in caps or not. Lots of error messages for me. Small I know but a factor for me. Shop around I thought the price was a little high.
2,Range is short.,"I bought the unit to control a computer connected to a TV set. The supported range is quite short-- maybe 10 to 15 feet. I have seen other units with much longer range.Other than that, it works fine."
2,"Great mouse, Horrible keyboard.","It seems when designing this set, Logitech totally neglected the keyboard in favor with the mouse. Do not get this combo, try to buy the LX7 mouse seperately. The LX7 mouse is fantastic, its lightweight, its got great response time and has never caused me any problems. However, the LX710 Keyboard is going to get replaced *very* soon. It is plagued with incredibly slow response times (if you type more than 30wpm, you'll notice it.) I am a gamer, and while playing, keys will severely lag or the keyboard will stop responding. This requires reconnecting the wireless receiver to the USB port to fix. Logitech has yet to respond to any concerns regarding the keyboard, and there have been a few on the forums.The only reason this combo received 2 stars is because of the mouse. It's great and has given me no problems, and If I could purchase them separately I definately would have."
5,Great Combo at a fair price.,So far the keyboard and mouse have been working perfectly. It's great not playing tug of war with wires anymore. Make sure you download the newest software from the Logitech website as it corrects some minor issues.
3,Stay within 2 feet,"For almost 2 years now the kb and mouse are serving me well, easy to setup and use. Transponder's effective range is approx 2 feet, anything further and start missing key punches. I have seen an improvement in range and performance with fresh batteries, which, is a better design feature, run out almost simultaneously on the kb and mouse, every 90 days or so. All in all an ok product."
4,Great Product,This is my first wireless keyboard and mouse experience. I have used it for a couple of days only but I am amazed at how efficient this product performs. The only downside for me is the font size and font style on the keyboard.
5,Good Purchase!,"Great Keyboard. It's as simple as plug in and use. it's lightweight, the finish is soft and not ultra plastic-y, and the buttons type quietly. Plus there are tons of actually helpful buttons around the edges. It's so easy to set what the buttons do, and the options are endless (instead of just giving me 2 options that i have to choose from).My only issue is that I always accidently press the grey buttons around the edges when I'm picking it up, which sucks since it's usually the music button and then I have to wait a minute as my computer slows down trying to load my napster. But trust me, it's not so bothersome that I wouldn't buy it again.Overall it's a great purchase. I haven't run into ANY problems with either the mouse or keyboard drifting ""out-of-range"" of the receiver's sensors, even though there's stuff in between them (a pc, a solid wood desk, various crap) which I was happily surprised about.I'd definitely reccomend it"
5,Multiple Myeloma: The Plain English Handbook for Patients and Care Givers,What a fantastic book!! It's pulled together all the the facts that I have read from different resources and compliled them into one simple concise and understandable context. Believe it or not I can hardly put it down. I'm ordering 2 more for relatives.Thank you Mr. Heller
5,Like the inverter for camping.,"Have used this for power at primitive campgrounds. It will run my camper lights, charge my phone, & run my air pump to blow up my air mattress, also have used it numerous times to get others cars jump started."
2,Not for tire inflation,"It takes about 2-3 minutes to inflate a 44psi max 15"" low profile tire on a '91 Acura legend.While inflating the fourth tire, the compressor failed.Total run time was under 10minutes and I let the unit rest 2-4 minutes between tire inflations.I have not tried the other functions."
2,Rating is for Xantrex Customer Support,The nozzle packet was not included in the delivery and Xantrex is making it difficult to get it.
5,Must have for anyone driving,This is a great product to have in case of emergencies but also works when a neighbor needs a jump start. Easy to use and reliable. Just remember to keep it charged before a long road trip.
5,Outstanding contribution to asian-american children's lit.,"This is a fabulous book! I read it aloud to my third graders and they simply adored it! It is a great contribution to my multicultural library. There are lessons to be learned about the asian-american identity, about character education, about the trials and tribulations of growing up, and about life in general. I have the fortunate opportunity to be a friend and former colleague of Ms. Marsden and she presented a fabulous author study to my students. I highly recommend this book for use in the classroom. It should become part of the canon for high quality children's literature."
5,Nothing's stranger or funnier than the truth.,"I'd like to say the book was good, but I can't. It was great! There's no need to cuddle up and prepare for a single sitting to knock this book out. It is best served up just as it was written, in short bursts of reading and longer bursts of laughter. The real-life pictures this book paints will have you envisioning being there as they happen. Be prepared to laugh and reflect on the memorable moments of these stories and be reminded of your own. Easy, fun and worth the time to get away."
4,Sony never let me down,"I highly recommend purchasing Sony MDR-Q68LW, I appreciate the retractable cords on this particular product. I always have issues with the cord, I usually wrap cords around my Ipod, eventually, the cords become shortage out of the pulling. I always been a huge fan of Sony products, to headphones, Walkmans, DC players. Sony always provided high quality products. Good Purchase!!"
4,"Light, comfy, but i expected better audio quality","In-ear type earphones never work for me (never fit well) and normal headphones are too bulky.I was looking for discrete over-ear phones that I can listen to when I'm in the office, and I purchased this item after reading reviews here.Retractable feature is nice, they're super light and comfortable too.But I was hoping for better sound quality, I feel they are not insulated enough, they sit on top of your ear, instead of kind of enclosing & pressing to your ear like normal headphones. So it doesnt damp out outside noises so well.Not sure if this is the case with all clip on type of headphones.Just my two cents."
3,I retract my assumption that a retractable cord is a good thing,"These lasted for 5-6 months, depending on whether you consider their death to be when the cord started retracting on it's own or when one of the speakers went out. Before either of those problems I liked these headphones. Like many, I was looking for a pair comparable toSony MDR-Q22LP w.Ear Headphones with Interchangeable Headphone Capswith a more manageable cord. Though I was a bit annoyed at how short the cord was, the sound and comfort of these were about the same as the MDR-Q22LP's so I didn't complain much. However, once the cord kept getting shorter as it would not easily stay locked in place, I was ready to be done with these headphones. Luckily, I had a pair of over ear sennheisers for back up."
4,Great product,"this is a great pair of headphones. They won't fall off if I go running, a problem I always had before with earbuds, and they also are so easy to put away neatly. It's so great that I don't need to worry about tangling the cord anymore :DAs with all retractable cables it seems a bit flimsier than most, but I haven't had any problems yet, and hopefully it will actually last longer simply because the cord isn't going to get twisted around as much. :) At any rate it is convenient."
5,The best buy ever!,"On the tube over the weekend I saw someone attempting to untangle their headphones, and I remember the irritation and frustration that used to give me. However, I don't have that with these headphones. You can adjust the length so there's no excess cord interfering with other things and when you want to pack them up you just hit the button! It's so convenient and saves so much space. The sound quality is as good as any ear bud and they take up little space without all the cord tangling mess! I love them!"
5,Upgrade time,"Now, while I still use meSony MDR-Q22LP w.Ear Headphones with Interchangeable Headphone Capsto the point of wearing out the foam covering, I got fed up with the cables, even with use of aSumajin Smartwraps Earphone Cord Manager.Then I found the Q68, the retracting cables are a great aid in pocketablity.No more tangles!Still they do have some minor niggles those being: the length of cable and a slight decrease in sound quality."
3,Their Ok.,"I got these with high hope and at first they were good. But after a while i realized how bulky they were and didn't stay on very well. The sound quality's decent. I was hoping to replace my ipod headphones, but I would say the ipod ones are better for me."
3,"Works great, but doesnt sound great","The retractable wires are awesome, i always have problems with getting my wires tangled. But the speakers dont sound as good as other Sony phones."
3,"Convenient, but don't last long","I got these because I didn't used to like in-ear headphones, and over-the-head headphones didn't seem portable enough.PROS: They are definitely comfortable and portable, and you never have to worry about the cord getting tangled.CONS: They break easily. Ether they stop retracting, or you lose sound in one (or both) side. Usually last a few months. I've actually been through at least 4 sets. I guess it could be that I didn't take good enough care of them, but it seems likely that they just have too many moving parts."
2,"Nice idea, poor quality","I had this for about 2-3 weeks and I am preparing to return themOver all the sound was nice and it fit around my ears nicely and the retractable cord was really handy...However, the retractable cord has already started to get jammedif you read the details on the back of the box it actually mentions this problemI tried to treat it as carefully as I can but well... it didn't do any goodthe cord is also scarily thin and looks extremely fragileso I don't think this will be a good long term product"
3,Not what I hoped,"I totally agree J.Berg's review of this product. I still have my old MDR-Q22LP but the rubber cushion thing is all shot, so I needed a replacement. The Q68LWs are by far more convenient, but the bass and treble are not as great, and the cords are as mentioned by others, quite short. I don't know if the trade-off is worth the decrease in my preference of sound quality, but comparing these two side by side, I prefer the MDR-Q22LPs, though they get tangled in my pocket quite a bit."
4,"Durable, Reliable, and Good Quality Sound","This is the 3rd set of headphones I've owned. Exact same. I had one pair that my dad took, then bought another pair that I used until it asked me to relieve it from the world of sound delivery (travel, gym, random use) -- excellent quality. Highly recommended within its category. Yeah it isn't noise cancelling, but it is easy to transport anywhere and the quality is actually quite good. highly recommend it!"
4,Not bad for the price,For the price it does what it suppose to do...The wire retracts all the way without being tangled. Also I don't have any problem with the length of the wire. Sound quality and volume is pretty decent. It beats having to wrap the wire after every use or untangling the wire before using.
2,"Ok for regular wear, slip off during workout.","I sweat a lot when I work out, and these start slipping off my ears when I'm on the treadmill. Also slip off my ears trying to lay down on weight benches."
1,Do Not Buy,This iron stopped working for me like everyone else. It turns itself off and then put water all over your clothes. It is worth the money to buy a Rowenta. This is my first and last purchase away from Rowenta's but I will never buy another brand again. B&D said that they are not getting complaints but I do find that hard to believe.
1,Good only while it lasts,"We've had this iron for over 4 years and I loved it until it STOPPED WORKING this week. Same thing others have said- the on switch will not stay on, making the iron totally worthless. I'd like to find an iron that heats up as quickly, but doesn't fall apart after a few years of use."
1,from a nursing student's perspective...,"this book is a waste of time and money. i purchased the book because it was REQUIRED by my instructor, but i'd rather spend the $45 on a textbook or nclex prep book rather than on a book that gives an overview of some of the issues that come up in nursing--getting along with co-workers, research, hipaa--all things you learn with practice and experience. if you really need the book, look for it at the library or check to see if your instructor has it on course reserves."
4,Great Fun,My daughter who is 7 rec'd this game for Christmas and we love it. It is a lot of fun to play - especially for the American Girl fanatic. Great to help them with reading comprehension as the questions all revolve around the books they have read.
1,FALSE INFO,the cable is good to go. but the software is not software at all. they are link files to websites that give you the runaround. Now I need to make another purchase for the software. I can't download anything to my phone without the software for my Motorola I855 boost mobile phone. It's very difficult to obtain software for some moto phones. myjal mediapal is the only one i'm familiar with for downloading tones and backgrounds but it's a trial version only.
2,they where helpful,Eforcity Was great! the Item I received was not what I had expected but they promptly refunded my money and really worked to make me happy. and I hope if they ever get a product that will work with my Motorola i850 phone they will let me know. So far nothing will (Not their fault!)But they still took care of me. Thank you!!!
1,Didn't get what was specificed.,"The seller's ad specified items that you do not get. In fact the ad tells you twice what your suppose to get, but in a little blurb stating you don't get the wire or instructions. This blurb is only visable if you purchase through Amazon a certain way, wghich was not the way I did. After speaking with the seller, he claims you don't need these items, so apparantly he knows more than the customer. I would suggest you look elsewhere."
3,Works as advertised.,"Works as advertised. If you've installed this near a garage water hose, wrap the sensor in a translucent plastic bag. The sensor may be reasonably weather-proof, but it isn't waterproof."
3,Good guide to writing copy,"I had never read a book about writing copy before, so a lot of what I read from this book was new to me. I learned a lot from reading this book, although I felt that a lot of it repeated itself over and over. ""Be concise, be specific, get their attention, have an eye-grabbing headline."" Well duh. I had to have read a lot of the same things twice, although they were designated for different topics, from advertising to brochures to press releases. At least I got the information tattooed into my head. This is an older book, so the section on writing copy for websites is rendered completely useless. But other than that, if you want a guide on writing effective copy, this is a good book for you. If you are experienced in copywriting, it could be of help, but you'd be reading what you already know."
3,Ok,Just ok movie. Didnt think it was all that good and acting was not great and the background story that was not tied to what happened in Guadalupe was a bit distracting.
5,Great film,"A great film for all to see. Provides an accurate look at one of the most reveared images and her impact on the Mexican people. If you do not understand the language, subtitles are available. Recommend watching twice, once with the sub-titles so you know what's going on, and once without, so you can enjoy the beauty of the movie."
4,"A sweet story, a bit confused...","It gives a nice overview of how Guadalupe came to be, but is rather sparse on detail there. The parallel story line of contemporary relationships somewhat interweaves this first narrative, telling about some Spanish/International scholars doing some sort of research at or about Guadalupe, and having some typical modern relationship problems. It's probably all very clear to the cineast aficionado expert, but to one raised on action films and slapstick, it's just a way for the director to show how artsy he can be when he wants to. Nice to watch, though, and does not sneer at catholic tradition, like so many works of the Hollywood mainstream feel compelled to do..."
4,Not the same,"I was used to purchasing this perfume in Europe the color was different and the fragrance is different, I will not purchase it again in the U.S."
5,"one of Ealing's first, and fabulous","A wonderful film for young and old. The heroes are a group of boys, and one girl who mixes it up with the best of them: post-WWII Baker-Street Irregulars. There's intrigue and suspense, and Alastair Sim at his comic best as a timid writer of tabloid adventure thrillers.How sad that this film is not available on a Region 1 dvd! But if you have a multi-region dvd player, you can order it from Amazon.co.uk for 9.03, including shipping (about $18.00 as of this writing)."
4,An enjoyable read,"This is another great story by Card. I think he could have taken this storyline and developed it further, turning it into a short series, instead. There is some sexual content including homosexuality, so just be aware of that. It's not a lot, but it's there. I wouldn't say this is anywhere near Card's best, but it's easily above average and kept my attention all the way through."
3,"Pleasant Enough, but Haven't We Seen it Before?","It's easy to tell 'Songmaster' was written at different times. The breaks between each section disrupt the narrative flow. Card seems torn between which story to tell. At one point, he's telling the story of the Songhouse, then Ansset's quest for love, then Ansset's redemption. Just when I'd figured out what the book was about..it changed.The problem with the changing theme, is that none of it matters by the end. When Ansset returns to the Songhouse, the love he's felt for Mikal or Josif or Kyaren doesn't matter. It's superfluous.Another complaint...doesn't the book's theme seem familiar? Young boy..prodigy..better than everyone else. It's Ender's Game all over again, with Card exploring the same themes he did in the entire Ender series. Young prodigy, outcast from the main struggles for acceptance..which is why this is not a great book."
5,Best Burberry Fragrance there will ever be!!,"My daughter came home from Basic Training in the Marine Corps, and smelled so good, I couldnt rest until I smelled the same, Burberry By Burberry smells so good, it would even smell great on a man, LOL! I just love it, and have bought at least 2 bottles recently. I cant believe the bargain price also. I spray 2 sprays right after bathing, and I still smell the cologne when I go to bed at night!! It truly has staying power. Trust me on this one, if you put it on, you will be enjoyed by the people who come in contact with you. Great stuff!!!"
1,Couldnt stand the smell!,"Could barely smell anything. Was watered down and the smell seemed off, not burberry. Just smelled liked chemicals that were watered down. What a waste of money cant ever return it. I have bought a couple of perfumes from Amazon before with no problem. This was just horrible, went in the trash can."
5,Wonderfully classic scent with hint of sexiness,"This has been one of my favorite scents for years now. It's warm, slightly musky scent that feels classic and sexy at the same time.You can't beat the price on Amazon for this size bottle."
3,Smells good,"It's got the European feel - the smell is stronger and more noticeable than American brands. Great value for money. Bought it as a gift for my wife, and she loves it enough to stop using her preferred brand."
3,Burberry,"More of a musk sent then I would like it to have. Does not have a long staying power when you wear it. Maybe the other brands smell better but I just didn't care for this parfum. Have wore it twice and will end up giving it to someone else in the family who may like it. One good thing, I did get a much better deal price wise buying it on Amazon."
3,Smells great!,Received the product timely as the seller stated. No complaints! As always this is a great smelling parfume. The only complaint would be the size. Not sure if it is misprint but it was actually a 1.5 ounze instead. But for the price and the great smell that I love I had no complaints.
1,Steretype,"The author makes a clear but predictable set of complaints against the Pope: contraception, abortion, women's ordination, divorce. What is diturbing is how she claims that her view is somehow the view of all women. Why doesn't she give equal time to other Catholic women who don't share her views? Where is the space for anticontraception philosophers Janet Smith and Elizabeth Anscdombe? Prolife activists life Mother Angelica and Helen Alvare? Opponents of divorce like Molly Gallagher? This new stereotype of the antipapal feminist woman is more offensive than the old one of Donna Reed making cookies."
2,Good for diabetics who don't worry about strokes,An excellent book for help in avoiding bad things for diabetics. Unfortunately the resulting salt content for most recommended foods/meals is way too high.... blood pressure issues start to come into play . Bland meals require sodium to compensate.....but try buying any prepared foods without swallowing half the dead sea.
3,UNIMPRESSED,"The ONLY MIX AND MATCH thing about the book is 4 pages in the introduction of the book that list all the recipes in a weekly breakfast dinner lunch diagram.Otherwise the 4 pages it is a REGULAR COOKBOOK for diabetics. The ONLY other cool thing is that is does have a shopping list for each recipe. You could say, I'M NOT TOO IMPRESSED."
5,Considered the best exposition of phenomenology,"Anyone coming from a rational empiricist background need not be offended by Heidegger's thinking since he does manage to look at matters from a radically different perspective that is novel and worthy of consideration. In this way, he expands our own thinking and puts into critical relief our own position. This is considered by scholars to be the best exposition of phenomenology. The fact Heidegger is able to explain other thinkers and other philosophers in such a superb manner seems to indicate how thoroughly he thought through to get to his own position. Paul Edwards cursory dismissal of Heidegger, although a worthy cause in itself, doesn't do justice to Heidegger."
4,DOA,"I received the product dead on arrival. But as it turned out, only the batteries were dead, probably because there was no pull tab. I replaced one of the batteries it didn't work. But when I replaced all three batteries it worked fine. The batteries are inexpensive when you search for the lowest price and buy them a 100 at a time. I paid about $6 for a hundred of the batteries."
1,smelly,this lamps smells as it heats up. we changed out the bulbs but still to our dismay it still smelled. The lamp puts out this plasticy smell and its as though something in your house is burning down!
1,burning plastic smell,i was wondering what that burning plastic smell was...this lamp is horrible! the lamp gets extremely hot within minutes of turning it on...take my advice and don't waste your money!
1,What's that smell?,"It's the lights, they smell like burning plastic whenever they're turned on. Problem was not solved by switching to lower wattage bulbs. The lamp shades (where the on/off switches are) get super hot to the touch too, so they're also a safetly hazard. My advice is to avoid this lamp, if you shop around there are better options that are also affordable."
2,Keep looking this one falls short,I was rather disapointed in this book. It appears that Ms. Graham Scott's prefered method of dealing with bad bosses is just to put up with them and keep things as status quo hoping it will all work out in the end. Pretty lame advise in my opinion. I am looking for a book that actually helps me solve problems not just put up with them.
2,Repetative,I think Grumpy is the best song on this cd. The rest are very repetative and hard to listen to.
1,Don't waste your time.,"Don't waste your time on this one. Beyond the fact that most of the information is out of date, it's uninformative for the time it was made. I do not respect a documentarian that only hides behind a camera and carries the weight of public opinion who gives the answers they want to hear for their narrative. A family from the south visiting the White House is not public opinion and should not be solely showcased. Also the prison sequence is unrelated to the topic, and cheaply used for shock value."
1,a bust for Norton,"I work in the publishing industry and know that Norton spent a lot of money on this book. It's not selling very well, sadly, but if you read this turkey you'll know why. It features some of the most stilted, mawkish, faux-insightful prose I've ever read. Not even good for a laugh."
3,10 easy models,"... Ok, I'm always on the lookout for the complex models. This book has about 10 easy/moderate models, a good one past beginner book.I only gave it 3 stars because it wasn't clear what was in this book by the title or the editoral review. Otherwise the instructions are relatively clear. It's also that the models while ok, are just that, ok."
5,An excellent CD by a great songwriter,"GP, like all great artists, consistently produces great stuff. Nowhere is great music, top to bottom. The grooves, the lyrics, the humor, the anger, pop through as powerfully as ever. We caught his act with the Figgs in St. Louis. If he comes to town, go see him. To say that GP is underrated really isn't worth saying any longer. The stories he tells in his songs, along with the most listenable of rock and roll the stories are wrapped into, stand beside Springsteen and Dylan, with a wonderfully sly and ironic sense of humor like Zevon."
5,Great Shower Head,Removed the water resistant feature with nail as suggested by other review. UNBELIEVABLE power and spray area....this shower head ROCKS.....great way to start the day....Total 5 stars!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5,LOVE this Shower Head,"I absolutely love this shower head. My boyfriend and I have experienced a similar if not the same shower head at a hotel chain that we frequent and see no difference. I have mine attached to an adjustable arm (I'm 4'11"" and my boyfriend is 6'3"") and the water pressure is still perfect. It feels great and gets the job done. I highly recommend this showerhead!"
5,Like an evening shower,This shower head provides a very big broad but gentle spray like a full evening shower. And it even uses less hot water than before. Easy installation.
5,quick paced good mystery,I like this writer. He's better than most and gets you involved in the story line with an interesting twist using homeless as his investigating team
3,Slow Burn,"Enjoyed this mystery, humorous, cheeky, a good read, I recommend it. Plan to look for more of this author's books."
1,Could Not Install,"Waste of Money. Don't buy this. Unless you are very lucky, you will not be able to install it. The install options are terrible. We were never able to install it."
5,Silver Egg Personal Body Massager,So far it has better quality than Adam & Eve products. My wife is very happy with it.Silver Egg Personal Body Massager
3,Mixed bag,"It's a difficult review to write. On the positive note, dancers are technically superb. On the negative, music is the worst future. Minkus was hired as a stuff composer of Mariinsky ballet specifically for his ability to write ballet music by the yard and it was before reputable composers considered writing music for a ballet a worthy endeavor. So the music is circus'y , you just expect horses starting galloping around and doing tricks. Choreography, with rare exception, is a collection of banal and interchangeable bravura steps which don't allow development of much individuality. Sometimes dancers of Paris Opera Ballet perform like technically perfect clones, sucking all life and emotions out of choreography. This is one of these performances. Libretto is absurd too.The whole impression is of a museum piece valuable for historians and conoiseures: it gives a perfect example of how ""routine"" Russian imperial court ballet entertainment must look like."
3,Adequate,"These TV trays are made with quality wood and look nice. However they are very unstable. It's too easy to spill drinks or coffee with just a small bump. That being said, I have never used a TV tray that didn't have stability issues."
4,Can't beat it for the price,"We needed the extra seating for kids at Thanksgiving and this helped. The stand is a bit on the shaky side but the tables are steady. It met the needs and the tray tables themselves are sturdy enough and come in very handy. We just rented the first season of ""24"" and we could not pull ourselves away from the TV so we had dinner on these....and I was pleased. I wish I could have gotten them in darker color to match other furnishings but you really can't beat the value."
4,Excellent Tray Tables,"These aren't the biggest I've ever seen, but they are quite adequate, simple, sturdy, attractive and well made. The wood is beautiful with a natural finish. The storage stand is cleverly designed and unobtrusive. These would make a very nice gift for newly weds just starting out in a new home or apartment. Delivery was quick and the items were securely packaged."
2,Tanzanian Mountain Ball Dog Toy Large,The Tanzanian Mountain Ball Large Dog Toy I received as others have commented is not that Large. It was also black. I am very disappointed in the color and I'm sure it will be lost in the shadows very quickly. I think I would have liked this item had it been a different color than the one I received.
5,My dog's new favorite ball.,"I threw this onto an order because it was an add-on, but my bull terrier adores this ball. He likes to carry one toy and chase another simultaneously, and this ball is a fave because it rolls so smoothly and bounces so high. The only problem is that it's so small, it continuously goes under the stove & then we have to fish it out. Would love a larger one."
4,Great Costume. Excellent Company Customer Service!,"After receiving this costume, my daughter put it on and it fit great except the cowl/mask. It was much too small for her head (and her head is average size). I contacted the maker of the costume, Rubie's Costume Co. and they were great! They offered to send a new, larger cowl to me. The larger one fit much better, bigger than her head, but at least it fit this time. Now she has a great costume to play in and wear for Halloween. I would definitely order a Rubie's Costume again."
2,my review of sleep medicine: essentials and review,"I purchased this book for the purpose of studying for the ABIM sleep boards. I mainly purchased it because of the large number of review questions (600). Unfortunately, the questions aren't very good. Not a single question involves interpretation of PSG data! Hard to believe, but true. A large number of questions concern the question of which psych med causes REM reduction, delta sleep reduction, etc. Very dry stuff. I'm working through the questions anyway, but I found the questions in the ACCP SEEK (sleep) book to be much more reflective of the kinds of questions I think will be asked on the board exam (I took and passed the ABSM exam several years ago so I kind of know what to expect, I think)."
1,Deserves ZERO Stars,This is a RIP OFF - this is packaged to appear as if it is original material but it is not!! It was produced in Canada and is a dupe to sucker you into buying recordings that are not the originals!!AVOID!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2,Disney DoesThe Crystals,"Yup, I got took. I bought this at $8.98. Shame on me, true, but shame on Amazon for not alerting us to the fact that these are not original recordings - sort of the equivalent of musical lead paint. The music isn't bad, really, maybe three stars - and done by the Crystals, true enough - but not the way I remember them - more like Disney does the Crystals."
4,A Practical Guide to Teaching Adults Technical Subjects,Most train the trainier books deal with lots of theory and are not practical to the hands-on instructor. This one gives this type of instructor the basics without all the theories on which Adult Education is based. To some it may appear simplistic but it is very well received by them and very easily put into practice.
1,KEN ANDREWS BY HIMSELF WITH A DRUM MACHINE,"and a synthesizer. This album is possibly the worst i have ever heard, and it pains me to say that with my love of ken's previous work. I guess i was too into the work of his band Failure to really enjoy this CD. If you like poppy synthetic songs with poppy synthetic lyrics than this is the album for you!"
2,If Failure went Pop-Industrial,"I'm not a huge fan of the sound bites I heard, so take this with a grain of salt because I haven't heard the album entire. If you were a fan of Failure but found them a little to edgy, as well as to heavy, and don't mind pop, this is your album. It's as if NIN and They Might Be Giants did a compilation album during the eighties Devo scene. If you loved Failure but were taken aback by ""Year of the Rabbit"" do to it's more accesible, commercial sound this is definatelly not your album."
2,Not what I had hoped,"This software seemed to be working great, until I tried to save the program to a disc. It then locked up several times and when I tried to reopen the slideshow, it wouldn't open it, it would just freeze up and not respond. The features to create the slideshow were wonderful, the reshuffle feature made it so easy to drop photos in and then randomize them. I also liked that you could see where in the music each picture would fall. The preview of the show was great, however now I cannot even view that. I spent several hours, loading pictures and music, formating them so they were just perfectly placed and saved the file. Now I have nothing to show for all those hours of work. Somehow the software needs to be improved."
2,Pederson's Last Call disappointing,"Our book club so enjoyed Beginners Luck and I was looking forward to reading Last Call. However, it was a disappointing book The characters were poorly developed and the point of view was one of the reasons why. Was there one? One never felt close to the characters or really cared what happened to them. To me the only chapter well written was the last chapter where Joseph delivers to the readers, a 20 years later, epilogue.There were a few funny incidents, but much of the dialogue was tired. This book reads on about the 5th grade levelSorry Laura, but I don't think you put much effort into this one. Furthermore, the book was poorly edited. Appeared choppy."
4,Adorable clock,This is a very beautiful and plain clock that would look great in just about any room.
3,Not worth it,It wasn't all I expected or needed as a new sales manager. It was much less relevant information and didn't really help me.
2,2 stars - only for it's sleek look,"My husband bought me this one-handed pepper mill for Christmas thinking it would be great for my arthritis-weakened hands - in fact he bought me two, one for grinding salt as well. While I believe they do have a sleeker design than most of the ones I've seen, neither one of them was very efficient at grinding pepper. You pump and pump and barely get a little pepper out of them. He's sending them back and we'll try a different product. I think we're going to try the Unicorn Pepper gun next."
1,Buy this if you want Carpel Tunnel,"I bought this pepper grinder thinking it was a great idea to be able to grind pepper onto meats while I spread the seasonings with my other hand (thus not having to keep washing my hands after mixing in each ingredient... Boy was I wrong. I tried setting the grinder to different thicknesses but on any setting, the grinder hardly lets fall any pepper. I wind up every time getting a sore hand and hardly any pepper. This product sucks. Stick to the two handed method. Don't waste your money."
2,Worked for a while,"This mill was ok (not great) for a couple of months but did not age well. The grind became inconsistent and it was always a lot of work for the amount of pepper it produced. Eventually, it just wasnt worth the effort. Have also used the pepper ball style of one-handed grinder, which lasted 2 or 3 times longer than this one. Anyway, i am back, looking for a better one-handed grinder."
1,Terrible - a huge disappointment,"Just awful. Horrendously overpriced for a crappy, poorly-made item. The ""chrome"" is shiny plastic and very cheap looking. The mechanism barely works (and don't bother trying to use this if you've got even a touch of arthritis OR if you have normal-sized hands -- this is made for giant monster hands). It doesn't crank smoothly or evenly. And the pepper comes out a mix of dust and huge chunks (when it comes out at all) -- for every ten squeezes, you get maybe 1/32 teaspoon of pepper. It would take forever to season whatever you're cooking. There's nothing useful about this product. And there's nothing very nice about it, either. It looks so lovely in the pictures, all sleek and modern and sturdy. But in actuality, it feels and looks like a five-dollar bargain bin item. This is surprising from Trudeau; I own and adore many of their products and find them all to be of excellent quality."
1,BAD,"Like everyone below me said, it worked well for a few months then it just stopped working. DONT DROP THEM EITHER i had one break the minute i knock it off the shelf. BAD BAD BAD"
1,Warner's Blue Ribbon Book 2000,"The book though comprehensive is outdated in a world of online interactivity. Blurry photos in black & white do not allow the detail required for today's collector to come through. The book also expires each year and must be repurchased. 2 Thumbs DOWN! A better choice would be the NEW Crystal Collectors Register by author Sue Bilich. This Full-Color reference guide is more detailed, updatable and very informative. Excellent quality! This is the book collectors have been waiting for and will finally put the Warner Guides where they belong. In the TRASH !"
1,A bad surprise,The description for this item was originally for the PC. It turns out that this item was for the MAC only. A lot of wasted time and an unrecoverable shipping charge on my part. The original box clearly marked for the MAC Only. What a waste.
5,I still enjoy it - 35 years later,I guess this is the same story as the other reviews - I loved this book when I was a young girl and checked it out of the library several times. I recently purchased a used version of the book and enjoyed it all over again - more than 30 years after I first read it. Eleanor Cameron's style lets your imagination run away but in a believable way. I recommend this book for young and formerly young people everywhere.
5,How to get what you want without complaining,"Seriously, this is a fantastic book for pointing out how *clever thinking* gets this chicken exactly what she wants withoutA) whiningB) demandingC) having a hissy fitD) sulkingReally great book about thinking through a problem and finding an original solution. It's a long solution, but the chicken is very clever and she stays positive all the way through. In the end, she gets exactly what she wants, having worked quite hard to get it, and feels the satisfaction of a day well-spent.I think the book models a wonderful attitude toward success. Hard work and clever thinking pay off."
3,3 Heels for Sin and Salvation,"In the final installment of the series, Sin and Salvation Lucy has to battle evil once and for all so she can stop more innocent people from getting hurt/killed, and stop what/who is responsible for her ""visions"". She gets quite a shock towards the end, finding out a close friend/confidant is not who she thought they were. I will say, I had my suspicions as to who the ""bad guy"" was going to be, and I was part correct/part shocked. Read my full review at: www (dot) shoe-girl (dot) com"
4,Strong textbook,"This is not for everyday reading. If you are doing a serious study of, or taking a class in hermeneutics then this book is excellent. It is a LOT of reading. Print is small. Great outline layout."
4,demon hit list,"this book as well as othes are very informative, spiritually we needknowledge of our enemy , (satan) and this give us a list of the weaponswe need for warfare.bernadine"
5,The only unbiased book that tells the whole story,"Mr.Smith was able to write a story of the evolution of Fender Musical Intruments that was crafted in much the same way as Leo Fender's ""no nonesense"" technical philosophy. It seems that everyone who worked for the company is writing, or has written a book that often is either romanticized or modified to fit a personal agenda. The unbiased approach is both shocking and refreshing. Mr.Smith's book also has hundreds of rare and unseen inside photos of the factory, people, and instruments that alone are worth the price of the book. If anyone is interested in the history of this company, ""Fender Sound Heard ""Round the World"" is the only book you will need. Be warned, the book is as addictive to read and browse as playing a blues lick on your Stratocaster!"
2,Cronological layout (by year),What stands out about this book is that every two pages is alloted a year. So if you open to any page at random and you'll see a short account of what was happening with Fender that year as well as a sidebar on what notable happened in the world at large that year. The whole book is like that. So its not a serious look at Fender at all. Its not something I'd want to have paid full retail for.If you are interested in Fender guitars do yourself a favor and buy the book 'The Sound Heard 'Round the World' ..it will make you ashamed you ever thought a Tony Bacon book on Fender was worth owning.
5,"anita-""celtic lover""",I absolutely love this pendant---beautiful in every way--would recommend this to anyone young and old. Great value!!!
3,Assembly Instruction,"54"" Steel Goal with Hood & Back BarsTerrible instructions. Black Loc-In tabs break easily - I can't comment any further as I have not been able to figure out how to get the back bar to rest on back supports b/c the attachemnt peices have broken and now I am 2 short. Company Web site no longer lists this product and their solution tab had no useful info. I wrote to the company - am awaiting reply"
3,Paint fades to pink in a few months,Bought this for my 6 year old soccer player and he really likes it but the paint faded to a pastel pink color after 3-4 months of being outside. We spray painted it so he doesnt mind it now.
4,Decent goal for the money,"The directions for assembly are TERRIBLE!! It could also use some more velcro ties for the net. Once I figured out the puzzle, it is a nice sturdy goal for my kids. Sure beats the plastic or 'pop up' versions!"
5,great target furniture,I have all the dolce funiture in my living room. it fits all my entertainment electronics with frames and art pieces.
4,bookcase,"Great value. Looks good, holds lots of heavy books. Dose not fall over or wabble. Takes all of 3 minutes to set up."
3,"Its nice, but somethings fall out the back!",We brought this shelf to hold DVDs and CDs and it works great for DVDs but the CD cases are too smal and fall from the back. I guess that is why it is called a bookshelf!!
4,Does the job and works outta the box...!,"I've had this product for a while and it is just fine. The only thing that disappointed me is that I surveyed the measurements before buying and while they are correct, the bookcase doesn't seem as imposing as I had imagined. Either way, it's loaded with lots of textbooks and a lamp and it's shown no signs of weakness anywhere....P.S. It also folds which may be good for travelers...."
5,Great value,"These bookcases are a great value. They are made of solid wood, need no assembly and pack easily for moving. I highly recommend them."
4,So Far So Good,"Received quickly and in perfect shipping condition! (I thought shipping was secure so maybe those that received damaged goods should fault the shipper?) Unfold sides, fold down shelves, and voila! I've put it in my bedroom for the LCD Flat Panel and dvd player. Hopefully it holds up!Remember, however, this is a $60 piece. I have hardly a complaint, but with a CLOSER look you will see workmanship is not perfectly aligned in some places. Due to this I had to fiddle with the shelf grooves to lock in place (and one still doesn't fit quite right). Otherwise it's a deal and better than what I had before - nothing!"
5,"Super Easy Assenbly, Looks Great","I got this bookcase from the store because I wanted to take a look at it before the purchase, but you won't be sorry buying this on line either! The box does say &amp;amp;quot;Assembly needed,&amp;amp;quot; but it was THE EASIEST assembly I ever experienced -- you just need to unfold the bookcase. In addition, this sold wood book case looks just great. I bought 2 for the guest bedroom to display my stuffed animals and nick-nacks, and they are perfect!Just one thing, I wish they make a little lighter colored one too -- maybe oak color. However, I'm very happy what I've got."
1,Poor quality,I got this in and the box was completely intact but two of the shelves were broken. Overall it was very poor craftsmanship. I was using it for an event and felt like it was cheaper to throw away than pay the return shipping. Not worth the money at all.
5,I own three of these.,I own two black and one expresso in this Dolce shelf. I have been very pleased with the quality and the durability. The shelfs maintain their finish over time. They require no assembly. You simply unpack and fold the shelfs down. The packing on these is very good. They come in a very tight fitting box with plenty of padding and straps.I use these in my home office for accent display and book storage.
4,You will appreciate this when you move!,Nice looking shelves. Incredibly easy to set up and fold up... when you move you'll be able to fold up the shelf and carry it with one arm.
1,The bottom shelf broke within a week,"I was able to hold the bottom shelf in place by putting a brick under it, and was going to keep it, but now the hutch for the desk and the filing cabinet/printer stand have broken, so they are all going back. Very poorly made."
4,Good Quality for a used CD,"I received my Cd in a timely manner. The CD case was intact, the CD had minor-to-no scratches. Would purchase from this vendor again. Have no complaints. I had never heard the CD so I was satisfied with the price. I had a little difficulty with the CD playing on my Windows Media Player, but it had some type of playing device within the CD that uploaded. It played well in my car, however."
3,Mediocre,"This album could of been better for a comeback. I know Brat can do better than this. But not all is bad, the album has some hot songs on it. Like, ""F......"", ""Back Up!"" ft. Ja Rule, ""That's What I'm Looking For"" and the (REMIX), ""What'chu Like?"" ft. Tyrese, and ""Runnin' Out of Time"" ft. Kelly Price. It's a pretty good album, just could of been better."
3,This is an OK lp,"Well, I really hated this album. The only desent songs were ""F**k You"", ""Back Up (Featuring Ja Rule)"", and ""Hands In The Air (Featuring Mystikal)"". Although, the past albums, Funkdafied and Anuthatantrum (Anuthafunkdafiedtantrum is edited) were so good, now Da Brat does this 4 da money, not music anymore."
2,brat tat tat,"I am the biggest brat fan in the world. Funkdafied was great, anuthertantrum was even better. The new cd is not as good as either. The guest atrist are weak, the singles are weak, The cd had some good beats, the lyrics were poor below brat standards. she was givin a second chance for another hit CD but blew it........Da Brat is pretty much done 4 after this one...."
3,Too short,"This soundtrack is deceptive. What I remembered from the movie were the acoustic piano songs, and they are on here, but are only about a minute long, as is almost every track of this CD. 23 tracks, but only 35 minutes long... It does have the two Sheryl Crow songs, and those are good. The rest of the tracks are just too short to really enjoy."
3,somewhat disappointed,"I teach a small class at my church and I recently purchased two of the Century wavemaster training bags. I am disappointed in the design of the lock system. The bags are supposed to be adjustable for height but they will not stay up if you are striking the bag with any kind of force. A simple upper cut causes the bag to drop back down. I keep having to reset it. It also moves all over the place. I also have an older model which has a much better locking system and doesn't move around as much. If you ask me, Century should have stuck with the old design!"
4,Gets the job done,"If you want something to hit, but don't have a place to set up a traditional heavy bag, or you just don't want to, this is probably the best option for you. It does rock a bit and tend to roam even from my feeble punches, so you will have to reposition it every now and then. I don't know what a serious martial arts trainee would make of this, but at the very least the quality is good- it is durable and easy to assemble and use."
5,Great deal!!,"This training bag is great. This was purchased primarily for our son to practice his karate on like he does at class sometimes. However, it is sturdy enough for everyone to have fun with and we do. We like the compact size, it fits in with all the other equipment/toys in our basement."
4,Used by a...GIRL! It's nice...,"This bag is awesome. I pack a lot of punch and was worried it might not have enough weight behind it to stay put. I was able to put 4 bags of 50lbs of sand in it. I have room for one more, which it kind of needs because it does still scoot a bit across the floor i just haven't gotten around to it.I scooted it into a corner so that i could brace it with the wall and a towel (to quiet it down) and that seems to work. I just can't do 360 work out on it now.I'm 5'5"" packing punch and it's stable. It has many height adjustments to fit anyones need. Unless are you freakishly tall? I only worry about getting the sand out? But we'll cross that bridge when we get to it.All in all it's a great bag, i'm just starting so it hasn't had TONS of use, but just for recreational use i think it's perfect. Especially for the price."
3,"adequate, instructions needs improvement","adequate light ""heavy bag"" convenient in that you don't have to suspend it from the ceiling.the brief instruction ""manual"" needs improvement.it should indicate how much water must be added to fill it (i didn't have access to a garden hose as i'm using it indoors so it would have been convenient if it indicated the volume so i'd know how many gallons of water to add.it lists a ""gasket"" as a part of the system and the instructions remind us to be sure the gasket is inside the base fill cape but no where is there a description of this 'gasket"" so on first glance i thought the ""gasket"" was missing though I finally figured out (i think I did)it is probably the flat soft black plastic disc on the inside base of the cap."
4,"First rate crime show, but no subtitles or closed captions","This is a well written series. The episodes are original and the characters are interesting with a few of the usual types seen in crime dramas. Without the possibility of selecting subtitles or closed captions, the accents are difficult for an American to understand and one misses a significant amount of dialogue. The producing company should correct this."
1,BEWARE: stated size is wrong,"stated ""Product Dimensions: 6 x 6 x 7 inches""ACTUAL SIZE OF BOWL IS:5 1/4 wide x 2 3/4 inches high.I would return them if it was not such a pain."
3,Color is misrepresented,The colors of these bowls are not true to the illustration. The Avocado color has a somewhat grey cast to it and the interiors of the bowls are white not light green as shown in the illustrations. Nonetheless the bowls blend well with the greens in our existing dinnerware.
4,Beautiful but small,These bowls are very attractive though they are a little small. Not tiny but a little small for cereal or soup. They are listed as ice cream bowls and if you fill these with ice cream you would soon weigh more than you would like. It would probably fit 8 to 10 full scoops or even a full pint of ice cream. I went back to the site to see if they had the same Sango bowls in a larger size for soup or cereal but no such luck. I have not tried them with soup but I am pretty sure they would not hold a full can of soup like campbells.
2,Disappointed,"I read the great reviews of this toolbox and was expecting it to be well put together. So I was very disappointed to receive one with some sort of error piece on one side of the front where the lid closes. You can work it past the sticking out piece, but you have to do that. And the paint is partially peeled off that stray part.Also, and this might get better with use, but the handle sticks and is difficult to move forward and back.It's too much effort to repackage this and send it back. I'll just put something in it that I don't need to get to very often. And I guess no more Stack-On tool boxes for me."
3,Ghost Dog soundtrack,"If you are after the original music from the film, look out for the Japanese version of the soundtrack. It contains all the original instrumental versions of the songs from the film."
2,"not the music from the movie, really","() I've never been so crazy about Wu-Tang music, but the music in the movie made me want to give the RZA another try, because it grabbed me so. Instead it's another Wu-Tang relase more or less, without any of the instrumental stuff from the movie that got me. I signed on here hoping there was a parallel, true soundtrack release, vs Ghost Dog the marketing accompaniment. Hope there will be soon."
1,Major Disappointment,"The soundtrack in the film was excellent but the CD soundtrack bears no resemblance. Why substitute when the original material was so good. I bought the CD as a gift, you can't imagine the disappointment and embarassment this impostor will bring."
4,One of the Better Ones of this Series,"I was impressed with this entry in the long-running Hemlock Falls series. There were some interesting subplots: Meg, the chef sister, sometimes comes off as a caricature but not in this book; Miles may be disappearing for about a year on a secret mission...I was also surprised to see some quite current relevant mentions in this book; e.g., Enron, Iraq.A group of Civil War reenactors swarm into the inn at Hemlock Falls ready to reenact the 133rd anniversary of the Battle of Hemlock. Meanwhile, three of Meg's boyfriend's (Andy, a doctor) patients have died mysteriously and he asks Quill to help find out what happened. The two plots are interwoven quite nicely and also wrapped up quite satisfactorily.I hope to see more of this series as I find it one of the more enjoyable ones out there (with the exception of just one or two earlier episodes)."
5,A great read - an original story,"When I first read the book cover, I was like ""oh no - not another Vampire story."" I was pleasantly surprised to find out that this in NOT ANOTHER VAMPIRE STORY. Due weaves an original tale about African Immortals that will grip you once you really get into the story. I couldn't put it down and when I finished the book, I wanted more. Thank goodness, this is the first in a series."
4,Pretty Darn Good,The first part of the book was a bit slow so I couldn't give it 5 stars ... when it picked up though it was a screamin' ride. By the was it ended I'm betting there will be a sequel which I'll definitely buy.
5,NO QUESTION...This book should be made into a movie!,"I absolutely loved this book. I could not put it down. Tananarive Due, in my opinion, is a creative and outstanding writer. I know this book is fiction but Tananarive really made me believe that it was really happening. She painted a very vivid picture especially with the flashbacks to Abbysinia (Ancient Ethiopia) and slavery times. I found myself captivated and spellbound, anxiously awaiting for the next scene. I did not want this book to end. I hope that one day I can see this book on the big screen...."
4,Fantastic read,"This is my first novel by Ms. Due and is most certainly not my last. Due's writing is melodic and haunting. I found the passages depicting an on-the-surface peaceful and joyful life torn apart by fantastic circumstances to be gut-wrenching. The novel addresses issues of immortality, faith, parenting, inner strength. It is suspenseful and frightening. I had to keep reading to find out how Jessica deals with the frightening truth about her husband Dawit. Will she keep their daughter, Kira, safe? The best part about this novel: I actually cared what happened to the characters. This one is a great read for anyone who appreciates fine writing."
4,"A Book for Beginning, Not-Necessarily-Wiccan Witch","This is a great overview for the beginner. It describes the philosophy and idealogy, history, and folklore in the first few chapters, then moves on to practical instruction. I found the section on kitchen witchery particularly interesting. It does go into casting circles, ritual construct, and eventually deities, but is mostly a book of ""low"" (as opposed to ""high"", or rituallistic) folk magic. Despite the title, I did not find it to be particulary biased toward Wiccan magic, thus making it great for the beginner looking for a generic or secular approach.No section is terribly in depth, but it will expose you to a variety of magickal pursuits, leave you excited about continuing, and give you an idea what you wish to study more about."
2,fun but....,"This book is well laid-out and a fun read, but the errors in easily-checked information (such as the definition of ""newt"" and the year that the UK repealed the Witchcraft laws) puts the other data in question."
5,Life At Its Fullest,"This is a GREAT whitewater video! It is especially exciting to see a woman, Shannon Carroll, doing these hair raising moves. I held my breath during her rescue with the rope. Tao's record breaking waterfall descent was another TWITCH y moment. Also liked the magnificent scenery."
2,"Good game, bad book","The actual game system of Ironclaw is simple and flexible, lending itself to many different play styles. I especially like how well it deals with characters of varying sizes. That being said, this is probably the most TRAGICALLY formatted rule book I've ever seen.It has no index, too much artwork (from too many different artists), the table of contents leave a lot to be desired, and and a lot of the really important tables (like all the ones for weapons and armor) are stuffed into the back of the book."
1,Very unfinished,"My actual experience playing this game was with one of the playtesters for it's companion, JadeClaw...and it was confusing, to say the least, even given the fact I had a bad GM. The book has no index, and a lot of items (like the ""Bezerker"") are referenced in the text but impossible to find. The system is very limiting as well. This is an iffy game at best. I would reccomend, if you really want an anthropomorphic game, to get JadeClaw instead. At least you can FIND things in that book."
2,Best?,Not the best ... alot of songs are repeats. Most of the songs seem to be only par. One or two songs do catch the ear.
2,No,When we got the wig it didn't look anything like the picture. I even tried to style it and it was so matted down that it was unstylable. Will not recommend to anyone.
2,Not that great,The guys voice will put you to SLEEP! It feels like you are being conceled by a therapist. He is SO boring! But interesting information. Does not sound like a book but therapy. SLOW! SLOW! SLOW! ARGH!
5,Connection Exercises,"Connect with the deepest part of yourself. These exercises will show you how to make that connection, and then use it to affect your relationships."
3,It's Okay...,"While I'd be the first to say Alicia Cook (TERRIBLE name- no wonder she changed it to ""Keys"") is possibly the most overrated singer/songwriter to hit last year (while the truly greats like Michelle Branch, P!NK and Willa Ford were almost entirely snubbed at awards ceremonies) this song is enjoyable if you're in the right frame of mind. The gospel sound sticks in your head and the generic bubble gum-y R&B can work wonders. But I hear she's taking a break this year (Wow.. a one year career is REALLY stressful) and maybe she'll grow on her trip to Mother Africa like Alanis did when visiting India. Otherwise, our radios will still be infested with Alicia's best copy of Christina Aguilera's vocals and some more really boring melodies."
2,THOUGHTLESS DESIGN,"1) The stainless steel knob becomes very hot during cooking, so you must use a potholder. We installed a wooden knob in its place.2) The screw holding the base to the frypan becomes loosened very easily and often. We put a different washer on and used Lok-tite.3) The biggest problem is the poor thermostat. If you move the dial evenone notch, the whole pan seems to cool down...move it up a notch or two, and your meal is burned to a crisp. It requires constant watching and diddling. Our 30 year old frypan (same brand) had a label which indicatedwhat temp to use for each item you might cook.4) An adjustable steam vent in the cover would help so one could adjust the steam to go out the fan vent. This way, when you remove the cover,thecondensation dribbles all over the place.In conclusion, this is a very poor value for the price. We would not purchase this again, and wish we had kept our old frypan!! There is no free lunch!!"
1,9.99 lost for nothing,This was quite possibly one of the worst movies I have ever seen and I very much regret spending the money for it. I had high hopes for it because of the actors involved but we stopped watching because of how totally stupid it was. It was a total waste of money and time. It was just unbelievably bad.
1,Cardcaptor Sakura,"***This book is in Spanish*** Unfortunately, even though Amazon did not include that fact the details about the book, you WILL have to pay postage to return it (plus a $3.00 fee???) ...not worth it...so BEWARE! We had one very, very disappointed child on her birthday. Unless your child knows how to read Spanish, this will not be very entertaining."
5,Sturdy but an extra pair of hands to assemble was greatly appreciated.,The assembly instructions are very skimpy but the bookshelf can easily be assembled by looking at the picture and piecing the parts together. Getting a helper to help hold pieces in place during assembly is a plus. Once assembled this bookshelf is very sturdy and quite pleasing to the eye.
2,DVD,"Too much violence for a child under five, typical Scooby movie nice color, clear picture, well made video,a lot of Scooby doo in the film"
4,one of my favorites,"when i was a freshman in HS my friend jessica lent me the first like, 6 or 7 snow drops and i loved them. then she stopped buying them or something and i forgot about them for a while.now just graduated, i remembered the series and bought them all.they are ADDICTING!! i've been reading 1 a day and today i read 6, 7, and am now starting 8.i don't know what it is about them. they're just good.i like the art - it's very unique but i also love I.N.V.U. and it looks similar so i guess that's just the korean manga way ^.^ loves it.p.s. - the one thing i wish they would show more of is ha-da and ko-mo's relashonship!! i love ha-da and ko-mo!!"
4,Forbidden Desire And Love,"This story is different than any I've read before. It was a pretty emotional read for me. There was pain, guilt, madness, forbidden desire, and love. All of us make mistakes and sometimes life puts us in circumstances that pull at our being with such intensity that we may make choices that will give us consequences that aren't pleasant. This is a story of two true soul mates meeting, knowing each other beyond face to face meetings. Knowing that to act on this would be adulterous but they choose to go there anyway. This ends up pulling them apart before it brings them back together. You'll have to read the story to find out how life gives them what they both need. I found it an emotional ride and a very honest one getting to that Happily Ever After. :)"
4,Fine example of the Poteet series,"More people die around Jordan Poteet than in the vicinity of Jessica Fletcher. And, the absence of more books in this series might be due to Mirabeau turning into a ghost town as a result of the volume of fatalities. But, I'd still buy anything in the Poteet genre as long as there are bodies to stack up.This is one of the better ones, with a fine lattice of plots and characters. There is no pause in the action and you are kept guessing with a plethora of clues. Throw a log on the fire, pour yourself a fine vintage and prepare to be entertained by Abbott."
4,Great Product,Great product can really say that I enjoy using this. I am a sanitizing freak :) heheh. Compared to other products on the market this is very easy to use convenient and low priced. Thank you!
1,just not my cup of tea,"too technical, too verbose ..not an expose of those who flew and what they were subject to inthe combat arena."
1,Very short life span!,I purchased the Mintek MDP-1020 and I only got about 25 hours of use from it and then it just died-wouldn't take a charge from any source. I would not buy another!
5,Prophetic Novel of 1990 influenced 2011,"The Flawed Emerald is about the origin of the Ancient Egyptian Creator, Ptah, and his incarnations as King Tutankhamon and the narrator's rebirth in modern times. Vivid descriptions of battles fought by King Tut and the love interests of this shadowy Pharaoh come to life as a full narration rather than common, character speech-based novels found today. The prophecies found in the later chapters influenced the last 20 years after its creation in March 1990 CE. This novel was the first to state how the Dinosaurs died (via asteroids), and a cause of death for King Tut (fever, suicide). Initial publication of the original book occurred after 1991 via a reviewer, which sold well at the time. This book was used by Hollywood in making The Mummy Returns film, after Copyright 1995 Michael J. Costa, All rights reserved. The novel was partly-fictional on completion, so the 2011 Arab Revolution, the War on Terrorism, and other events were written in here first."
1,Very disappointed,"We purchased this for our 3 year-old son, thinking they would be as well made as ""mighty Machines"" and the ""All About"" series with Backpack Jack and Hard Hat Harry. However, we found out they are not even in the same ballpark. It says it was an ""award winning"" video. Apparently the contest was held in hell. Poor production values, bad narration and music that make one yearn for fingernails on a blackboard. The main character looks and sounds depressed, but then again, we were too after watching this video. Do yourself and kids a favor, and stick with the Mighty Machines series. It is superior in every way. Unless your trying to punish your children, its best to avoid this collection."
3,Good for kids,"These videos keep my 2 and 4 year old boys entertained and they love playing along with their own toys. The footgage is pretty old and the commentary is cheesy but as long as the kids like it, fine by me."
2,Squeaker no match for stronger jaws,Our lab easily pushed the squeaker into the ball within an hour on each of these balls we gave her.
3,what I think,"THE CLAY MARBLE was a very entertaning book thoughout. This book, being that is was set in a war, was very sad. I loved to see how people survived the war with no food and barlely and help. Reading this book made me realize how lucky I am, not to live in that time and in Cambodia. Overall, I thought this book was really good and I recomend it."
5,awestruck-astounding-minfong ho does it again,"The book THe CLAY MARBLE by Minfong Ho was very good. This is an exciting story, with many turn of events. the plot was saddening, but in a sense lightening. It lifted my spirits and brought me to a different understanding, and to feel empathy for Dara. The protaganists were described very clearly, and the mood of them was very distinct.Some of the characters were very dynamic, which I liked because it gave the story a good twist, such as Chnay, who eventually ended up helping Dara."
4,the clay marble was alright,"I thought that The clay marble was a alright book. I liked how the the the characters were always changing from protagonists to antagonists. Espeacially Dara one chapter she was an antagonist and the next minute in the same chapter she was a a protagonist. I also liked all the different settings, Overall i thought that the clay marble was an alright book to read if you like a lot of changes in the story."
4,The Clay Marble,"The Clay Marble is a very amazing book. It's very sad but then very interesting. I like reading books that are based on true stories and thats why i really enjoyed the book. This book made me think of life differently. It's even cooler how the story keeps changing to exciting parts to very sad parts and it doesn't keep you bored one bit. The main character Dara goes through a lot of sadness and triumph. Her family travels to a camp that they think will make life better for them. But they come to find that life throws many arrows at you. In the end things get better for everyone, and more calm. This book will really make you think before you take life for granted."
1,THE CLAY MARBLE,"i thaught that the clay marble was good ,not! it was a complete waste of time and it was bbbbbboaring!"
2,The Clay Marble Rolls in,"I was very disapointed in this book. In school, we have reading groups, and the kids pick which book they want to read. My group was the group of kids who chose ""The Clay Marble"" by Mingfong Ho. Well, the back cover summary makes it sound interesting, we found out, and it suckered us into the book. None of us liked it. On the poster we made about ""The Clay Marble"", we explained that the characters were OK, but the plot was too fast-moving and there was too much just plain talking. Some parts were okay, but mostly we didn't like it. We wanted to like it, so we weren't complaining, but truth be told, it was boring. Sorry if I disapointed you, review reader, but the is the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.-BookLover24/7"
3,An Enjoyable Read,"The Clay Marble was an enjoyable read but I thought it was a little slow. From a historical view, I thought there would be more description of how the refugees lived, about the war, and Cambodia and the surrounding countries. The story itself is very good and would be an enjoyable read for a middle school student. Your heart really goes out to the characters and you can't want not to try and help them. It would make a good book for a book report or SSR."
1,Especially for those taking it for Lit,"I'm a 14 yr old, and I just did this bk for Lit at sch this year. I feel that this bk was very unappropriate for our age level for at 14, we surpass the recommended reading age group by TWO years. The Clay Marble was too simply written; there wasn't any deducing or analysing to do as everything was plonked down for you. Dara (the main charac) was very difficult to relate to, because of her immaturity. All the other stereotypical characs don't have real personalities either, but that would be because Minfong Ho meant it for a younger audience. It was very predictable that Jantu (Dara's influenza and manipulator) would die, for the sake of some melodrama. Most characters were not developed enough so it was difficult to feel for them. The review was not meant to be criticism directed at the author but rather an appeal to TKGS's Lit teachers (if any of them stumble across this) to consider other books with more depth for sec2 Literature."
5,Take a second look at what our world is really like.,"""A real page turner. On a scal from one to ten it would deserve...... a 10!"" The book The Clay Marble was a well rounded book and the characters gave it a look that no one could beat. Dara and Jantu had a life-long relationship and Dara would learn what having a family really meant. The quote that appealed me the most was the quote about the families like a patchwork quilt. The Clay Marble means a lot more now than it ever did before!Jessica SeymourThe American School in Japan"
3,Coby DVD/TV,"I found the product OKAY, It's a little on the cheap side; I did however purchase a different unit for daily use and saved this one for another day. The tuner on it; didnt have the sensitivity to pickup hard to reach TV stations. But all in all; you get what you pay for. Also Amazon doesnt actually sell this; It's through thier partner. J&R Music World, which is who shipped it to me."
5,Great Value,"All of the usual features with two particularly fine points. A ""hold"" button keeps whatever mode you have chosen from changing even through vigorous exercise. And, happily, it lacks an automatic turn over feature so old tapes that stick do not get flipped to the other side long before they are done."
1,Cheap imitation,I noticed as well that the color bleeds if you get them wet. Sizing of all pieces is irregular and they expand with humidity. We also had several sticks break and splinter.It's worth the extra $$ for a Tinkertoy set.
3,Not like when I was a Kid - quality isn't so great,"Love the idea of this toy, we did find that they are breaking very easily. I""m not that strong of a person and two wooden sticks already broke and we only got this for Christmas?! I hope it will last or it's going back. We love building and this is a great educational toy I just remember them being more sturdy when I was a kid."
4,Worth it.,"My granddaughter (age 3) loved this bear so much she slept with it as her pillow until it was FLAT. I mean road-kill flat. It got awfully dirty, and the lights in it stopped working, but she required it in order to sleep. We were afraid to wash it, so I bought another one and told her that we had washed it. That was tricky, but somehow we pulled it off.The new bear worked great for a little while, then started blinking wrong just like the old one did. Eventually, the lights went out, and Kitty was disappointed, but she still loves her bear.One last note: when we tried to squash it into an overstuffed suitcase, the lights worked again -- for a little while. I wish I were made of money, and I'd keep buying these things. If the lights are important to you, don't get your hopes up. If you understand these types of lights, maybe you can fix it.For our part, we still think it was worth it."
1,If the book were as hilarious as some of these reviews ...,"If the book were as hilarious as some of these reviews, we would have a comic classic on our hands. It is not. What God would or would not do if God really existed? Oh, please.Here is the general form of the arguments the book gives for the non-existence of God. If God exists, then He would do X. Not X. Therefore, God does not exist. What these guys are really saying is this: ""If I were GOD, then I would do X. Not X. Therefore, ..."" Well, if you ask me, the correct conclusion is: ""Therefore, I am NOT GOD."" I agree -- they are NOT GOD.Who is writing this stuff? Even more serious, who is publishing this stuff? Even more serious, are these people really reading this stuff?"
4,"Great little piece at a ""teaser"" price!","I have to say that I am very happy with my All-Clad Ltd pieces, including this little fry pan. Because of the price, I picked up this one and the 1 qt. sauce pan to give them a try. My family used to cook with the all ss line so I knew that these would be quality and I was not let down. Yes, stainless is more difficult to cook with, but have you tried hard anodised pots? impossible. That's why my equally beautiful (IMO) Calphalon professional pots are looking great as kitchen decorations and not much else. Your food will only burn if you are not paying attention to it. If you are having this problem, try non-stick, so you can go do whatever else it is you want to do other than paying attention to your food. If you are looking for top quality cookware that is oven safe, lasts a lifetime, and demands a little more care from the chef......this is it."
2,police stories,"I like history and mystery, etc. Was a little disappointed in these DVDs. I was going to order the whole series but after getting this one I won't waste my money on the rest."
3,Clearly Single Handed,Great views of rural/coastal Ireland. Stories were somewhat predictable. Irish brogue made it difficult at times to understand actors and stories often moved a bit slow. Probably one of the Irish/English police adventures that succeed better on that side of the Atlantic.
2,"Great filming, scripts lack credibility","Extremely good looking scenery, nice musical scores to the episodes, too. Alas, the scripts don't add up to good stories, the level of corruption exhibited by the police surpasses believability. That's too bad, because the series has so many good aspects, but the bad-guy characters lack subtlety, especially the retired cop whose son is the lead. Some pretty awful dialogue from time to time, too. Bah. Wish the writing was as good as the filming."
3,"Disappointed, until exchanged","This headset works well with my Kenwood TH-F6, but the mic boom does not stay in position because the rotating part is too loose. It allows the microphone to rotate down if the headset is being worn while walking.UPDATE: I exchanged this for another, and the mic boom stays put. However, the elastic ring is too tight around the ear; it's too small, and does not stretch. Painful if worn for more than a few minutes."
1,Corny baloney,"For someone purported to be one of the best jazz artist (innovative, versatile) this disk is hokey and corny. ""Definitive"" fluff la la la la la bull craap."
4,CD covers all of LA's recording career,The most important track What A Wonderful World (without kenny G) is included and the rest covers all of LA's recording career.
1,Kidz bop is unhealthy,"Kidz bop is unhealthy!!!!!!!!! It probably has subiminal messages to make your once-innocent child do things such as drugs, sex and murder!!!!!! The children in the cd are spoilt rotten brats who are mean and snobby and get everything they want!!!!! The pop music world is EVIL!!!!!!! Destroy it now!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,5/8 Mount Will Strip Your Stand Threads,"The female 5/8 socket is not properly threaded and will strip your stand mounts. Possibly a serious manufacturing problem w/ On Stage because I also bought an On Stage Mini Boom, and it has the same incorrect female thread spacing. Returning both. Stupid thing is that I also bought an MY325, and that 5/8 female thread spacing was fine.note: I tested the fittings with various equipment, and am positive that the female 5/8 thread on this (and the mini boom) is bad."
5,Satisfied,The Plano Pro Max Double Scoped gun case is big enough for my AR and Rem 700 with beafy 30mm scope mounted. The velcro straps are a huge plus as well. If all you are looking for is a case to protect your rifles to take to the range then don't spend the big money on other cases and look no further than this one.
4,Nice Rifle Case,This is a nice rifle case that has plenty of room for 2 scoped rifles/shotguns. It has held up well so far. My only complaint is that opening and closing the latches can be a pain sometimes.
4,Huge,"This thing is HUGE. It will barely fit in the trunk of a Toyota Camry, and still needs some shoe-horning to do so. it will barely fit 2 scoped AR-15s... and I mean barely. If you have an SUV or pick up, great. If you have a car, look for a different case. Having written that, the case itself does what it is supposed to, is well designed and well made, so I can't really knock the product."
1,Does not work in lg cu500.,Ordered two kingston memory cards for my and my wife brand new lg cu500 phones and neither worked. Scan disc is the way to go.
3,"Great, but something missing...","Al is really great... I discovered his videos just few months ago on the Internet. And when I found out that these videos are available on DVD, it didn't take long to order it... Finally, it arrived. And what? See the subject... Videos are great. But some of them are in really poooor quality. I was hoping for ANYTHING extra - at least subtitles to understand all the lyrics. Not mentioning the interviews or behind-the-scenes... Generally, you could expect something more for that price. But I don't regret this purchase."
4,~~Another fabulous book by a fabulous Author!!~,"I must admit that after reading Grey Eagle's Bride and Hunter's Bride, I was just a tad dissapointed with Joseph. But just a tad!! Oh, after you read these books, you wish fervently for the Beaudine brothers to come alive and sweep you off your feetin real life, just as they do on paper...never have I met better heroes that these fine brothers, although i gotta admit, Orion is my favorite...! I recommend that you read this one frist, then Grey Eagle, the Hunter. My least fave to my fave...they just get better!!!"
3,I was disapointed,"I was expecting the author to bring more light into the London's other side. She was just decribing the life of a certain category of immigrants that could happen in any part of the world...I would have liked for her to go deeper in her description of the characters. Sometimes she just touched the surface, they had more to say and share with us, but Hanane did not give them the opportunity."
1,car charger,I order this car charger with high hopes. It only worked for one week. I am very disappointed with this product and hope to return it to the seller.
5,tanzanian mountain ball,"My African grey parrot loves his tanzanian mountain ball-- loves to shred it, that is! I suspend it from his cage ceiling so he can attack it, swing from it, fall off it-- Ooops! He has a great time.JW Pet Company Tough By Nature Tanzanian Mountain Ball Small Dog Toy Assorted Colors"
3,It's ok,"You have to know going in.....that pretty much ALL of these ""vintage"" re-creation phonographs....be they ""table-top"" or ""console"" style and regardless of the brand......are not going to have a high-end sound. All of them that i have seen and heard have a very limited range and are cheaply built. Having said that....for the price....they DO look nice and the sound is tolerable. Just don't expect a ""Bose"" experience when you order one."
1,What Can I Say...,"Even worse than Fate/Stay Night. The graphic quality is just plain horrible. The story plot is just all scrambled and poorly explained. Just when things start to explain themselves, they just simply throw you another unexplained plot before they finished the last one. It is also horribly directed. The story plot and scene changes are very jumpy and again unexplained. I have no idea why they released such trash. I was actually looking forward to this, but I find it extremly painful to watch. I guess this is what happens when you try to squeeze two season worth of material into a 2 hour movie. Highly recommended against."
2,"inconsistent, but fun","I skimmed much of the silly science and bad dialog - and tried to focus on the plot, which rolled along towards a predictable and explosive climax. The subject matter of Atlantis, pyramids and lost races (?) forces some of the dependent background material to be from crack-pot and discredited soures, which I can forgive and even onjoy. However, I found the bat-logic used to string the Da Vinci Code-like clues together to be hard to read."
2,Lame...,"This book angered me to point of writing my first book review on Amazon. First of all this book reads like a movie script for a Jerry Bruckheimer movie, which by itself warrants 1 star. There is no character development, the dialog is embarrassing, and the plot has holes like swiss cheese. Secondly, for all of the science in this book, it seems the author 'maybe' read an issue of Popular Science and called it a day on research. Lastly, the writing is just really bad. The author uses this line at least 30 times to create suspense: ""And that is when they saw it."" I almost set the book on fire after the 25th time. I gave the book 2 stars instead of 1 because of the epic scope of the plot. It was actually a good idea, just very poorly executed - unless you're in to Jerry Bruckheimer."
2,Disjointed and ridiculous,"I guess I'm not with the majority. I bought this book based on reader recommendations and the ""similar books"" cited, all of which I had enjoyed. I did not think Decipher was well-written. In the first place, the characterization was poor, which is two strikes against it from the outset. The characters are not likable--for example, the four-letter word vocabulary of the woman ""star"" was a turn-off to me. Then, there was the convoluted story line, which was altogether ridiculous. I did finish the book, only because I couldn't believe it wouldn't get better."
5,Exceptionally good debut novel,Decipher transcends the genre and offers as many thrills as it does keen insights into a myriad of different subjects that have been woven into a sumptuous tapestry. That this book isn't more popular is a damn shame. People are missing out on something very special. For now it's my little secret.
1,Absolutely Horrible,"I've never written a review on Amazon before, but this book was so bad, I had to write something.Note that I could only get through about 100 pages of it before I had to toss it (in the garbage).I'll keep this short. The science was off, the theology was off and from page one, the grammar, punctuation and just about everything about the writing was terrible.This is the author's first book, I hope it's also his last."
1,Terrible. Unreadable. Ridiculous.,"If you have even the slightest science, engineering, or theological knowledge you will find this book unreadable. Other reviewers claim the author did ""extensive research"" but there's no evidence of that in the book. The whole thing is filled with so many enormous misconceptions of science that you won't be able to finish it. We're not talking about hard stuff; but rather basic high-school level things like combustion and continental drift.On the other hand, the author's knowledge of theology and linguistics is.... also entirely absent. The ""secret conspiracy"" stuff about when the gospels were written and the cult of Mithras is in fact well known and freely taught in every Christian bible college.Edit: Please note the ""real name"" under my name. This is who I am. I have not reviewed this book under any other name as some of the more paranoid reviews on this page state. Check what ""real name"" means if you're in any doubt."
3,This would make a great movie!,"This book is badly written, but it's filled with neat ideas (the nano-swarm concept is fascinating, among others). I really hope it gets turned into a Hollywood movie some day - it would be perfect for that!"
5,perfect clip,works great. no problems. fit on my boom stand great & holds every mic I've tried. great value & awesome thick plastic construction.
2,first clone battle pack,"the first clone battle pack is boring and lame. It has enough clone troopers but to many places to put them. If two go in the speeder and one on the gun turret than that leaves one clone for your army, not exatly a army builder. The speeder and turret are nice but unnessisary.pros:-shock trooper, star corps trooper, and two normal clones-nice speedercons-not enough figures!this set was fine exept for the lack of troops, don't get it unles you really wan't the speeder."
1,Nope! Lies and deceit!!,"This product was an album I probably should have listened to before purchasing, so I guess it was my mistake, but it was listed as by Ed Sheeran and when listening to it I quickly realized it is not the British ginger, but perhaps another artist with the same name? In any case, this should not be listed with Ed Sheeran's music as it is confusing and misleading! Also, the music is really weird...."
3,Good book with MS Project 2002 Trial Version,"If you are learning MS Project, you need to get the newest version 2002. MS has been updating it almost weekly, difficult to keep up. The theoretical foundation of this book is sound. Chap. 8 Managing Project Risk is very useful. It can be used as a graduate level course, 30 - 36 hours. The book does not include examples of real world problem solving and it is short, only 317 pages."
4,good,"good but I dont like the fact that the bulb dont last long I will be getting LED from now on. I only had these on the Chilids so i dont know about the out put, they will grow algae though"
1,Delivery ruined bookcase,"What was to be the perfect bookcase for the space came in a box that was battered and torn. It looked as if it had been dropped from a plane! The entire bottom shelf was cracked in half and all the hardware bent out of shape.I would really like to own this bookcase, but I want it delivered in usable condition!"
5,I really like the 4 tier version compared to the 3 tier.,"I loved this tall 4 tier shelf unit. It comes pre-assembled. You just pull it out of the box, unfold the shelves and place it where you want. I performed some simple surgury on mine to make it fit my needs better. I removed the backside slats on the top shelf and placed my 15"" TV/VCR combo unit on it. It sits on a 45 degree angle in the corner so the back of the TV does not bump the wall. It holds a playstation and controllers very well. I have a small Epson Stylus printer on shelf and it fits nearly perfectly (the paper tends to stick just above the upper shelf). I put my brother laser printer on the bottom shelf, with moderate success. In general, it will hold large books easily but paperbacks will probably look a bit out of place. I will probably buy another one or two soon..."
4,Very good value for the money,"As stated in my review title, I think this folding bookcase is a very good value. It can store a lot of books in a relatively compact space. It is solid wood, and has a slight wedge design (larger at base, smaller at top), so it is very stable. This wood (I own the related file cart as well), with its natural finish, mixes very nicely with all the chrome I have in the room with it. Because of its finish and its airy design, it fits into my very modern room, even though the bookcase is advertised as ""mission style."" I am very happy with the bookcase.One word of ""warning,"" however. This bookcase's shelves are fixed, not adjustable. The shelves are spaced to fit items up to 8-1/2"" by 11"". If you have a lot of oversize books (that you don't want to shelve horizontally), or if you need a bookcase with adjustable shelves for some other reason, this is not the bookcase for you."
3,kind of small,"I was really excited to get this bookcase because it looks so cute ... Unfortunately I didn't pay enough attention to the dimensions before clicking order, and it wasn't until I had the shelves completely set up in my apartment that I realized the unit is just a lot smaller than I need (top shelf is only 8 inches deep). It was a little hard to assemble too- for some reason the shelves weren't lining up with the casing. But if you know this is the size of shelves you want, you'll probably be very happy with it."
2,No Set Up Instruction,"This book tells how to do a lot with Outlook, but doesn't give the reader a clue how to set it up in the first place. Given the technical terms used by ISPs, it would have been useful to have some definitions and examples of setup. I can't use the book until I somehow figure that out."
5,disturbing and informative,"the pictures in this book explain a lot to me,seeing as my family originally came from this part of wisconsin. and many of *them* were insane."
1,This rug sucks!!!!!,"OMG!!!! You guys said it was so wonderful and all- well, this is a dumpy little rug. I am putting it in the basement- in the storage room. I would not buy this rug!!!! Shame on you guys for telling people it is a great little rug- it so is not. It looks like something you would buy @ wallmart for 19.99.....Cheap looking/feeling...."
3,Milland in his element,"Ray Milland again delivers a fine performance, in the tradition of ""Lost Weekend"" and ""The Big Clock"". A fine outing for Lang; his angles and lighting in this genre are second only to Herr Siodmak (Siodmak was German; Lang Austrian). Marjorie Reynolds' performance, however, is wooden, and her ""Austrian"" accent leaves much to be desired. Sure, she's beautiful: But her faux German accent alongside brother Willi is hideous (he's obviously a native speaker) and adds nothing to the sense of reality of the film. Scene with ""blind"" man on train during Nazi bombing raid is particularly gripping. True noir devotees will want this for the collection."
2,Hard to rate,"This video is from 1955 shortly after Judy Garland made the Warner Brothers film ""A Star is Born"". Judy looked rather plump in the video and ill. Her voice didn't help the performance it was screecy. The picture was pathetic it looks like the producer (of this video) just transfered the projector film onto the tape film. The film wasn't re-mastered or even upgraded. Judy's opening number ""Swanee"" was cut off which is a really shame.Her final performance however is quite amazing it's when she sang ""Over the Rainbow"" in her tramp suit it was done so beautifly it'll bring a tear to your eye. I think the only reason I gave it 2 stars was because of it. If you truly love Judy buy this video."
3,Okay but not worth the price,"I bought this after reading stellar reviews on AmaZon and elsewhere. First use felt awesome but continued uses yielded no measurable results. A drugstore exfoliant and a wash cloth achieve the same effect. Still, it does smell incredible - like fresh oranges. Won't be buying again."
2,Save your money,"For the price it's not worth it. Yes it exfoliates and leaves your skin silky soft, but no more then a cheap exfoliate from the store. And also the amount is so little, wayyyyy to expensive."
4,Gentle Peel,"If you have very sensitive skin and you are a newbie to peels...this would be the perfect peel for you. I have extremely sensitive skin and have now reached the age where my skin isn't so smooth...this peel does not irritate my skin and leaves it so soft. Also...the smell is great! However, if you have deep lines, scars, etc... on your face, this peel will not be strong enough for you."
3,Old item sent out,"I had a sample from Sephora, which is what caused me to want to purchase this on Amazon because it was cheaper. However, I used it twice and it wasn't foaming properly. I looked at the bottle more carefully and it was an older logo - I shipped it back and got a refund, so that was great!"
5,"soft, pore-less skin",Great peel! Quick and gentle but left my skin really clear and almost pore-less (around my nose area). My skin looked more evenly toned (I have light melasma) and felt nicely moisturized. Highly recommend it!
4,Panasonic RC-CD500 Great for Our Family,"We've had the Panasonic RC-CD500 for a few years now and think it's fantastic. (I'm getting ready to purchase another one for my 10-year-old daughter.) The reception is extremely good, even in our basement. I like the battery backup so that I can move the radio to different rooms without having to reset anything. The alarms are easy to set with forward and backward capability. The CD player is very good also. Some reviews have complained about the display being weak, but we see nothing wrong with it. My husband usually turns it off during the night so the light won't disturb him at all. We'll soon have two of these in our family! My son may get his own in a couple years."
3,eh..,I have no problem with the LCD screen...i can see it perfectly...however i thought the sound quality was gonna be better since everyone said it was sooo great... well ive heard better. secondly IT CANT PLAY CD-RWs ... the antena could be better... i cant get the radio station i want in my room
3,Descent Table,"The table is pretty nice and very easy to assemble. The finish on the top is a little different than the finish on the matching dining room table, but that's not a huge deal to me. It's not the best console table, but for the price that is expected. It is a little more narrow than I would like it, but I knew that before I purchased it. I was just looking for something descent to go into my apartment, and the table satisfies that."
5,Great piece for the money - gets lots of compliments,"I was a little skeptical about ordering a piece of furniture online -- would it arrive scuffed up or broken? -- but I was very glad I took the risk with the console table. I had seen it long ago in a Target store, but they have since stopped selling it in stores. It was as nice as I remembered it being when I saw it in person.Other than a very minor flaw in the finish on the top of the table -- which I don't think was an issue with shipping or handling -- it arrived in perfect condition. Everyone who has been to my house since I bought it has commented on what a great piece of furniture it is.One thing to note: the drawers are very shallow, so don't expect for them to hold bulky items like remote controls."
5,Great Table,"My mother purchased this for me since we just bought our first house and I wanted something neat for my entryway to take up a blank space. I also found this to be too long for the nook there, so I put it in the livingroom on the wall between the kitchen and livingroom windows. It added that something extra to the room that it needed. I too found it so easy to put together by myself b/c the little wrench is angled that comes with it. It's a snap! The only problem I had was the corner had a hunk taken out of it when I opened it up. So, being as this was the last one, I just glued it back on and used a brown crayola marker of my daughter's and poof...you can't even tell! I would recommend these tables to anyone who doesn't like paying a fortune for that modern and tasteful look!"
3,Ok for the price,"Pros: Looks good, assembles quickly, price is decent.Cons: Wobbles if placed on carpet (making the table wider would have helped stabilize it). Drawers do not have guides, and can be tricky to open and close, detracting from the overall impression.I use it in the hallway, and it is great for that purpose. One drawer can hold a wallet, sunglasses and possibly keys - no room for anything else. Overall it is a nice piece for the price, but I wish the manufacturer had taken care of the little things."
4,What a begining!,"Well Kay Hooper has certainly managed to start this book with a bang! Its kinda works backwards, where the two main characters- Robyn and Shane met at a party and really hit it off. The next day Shane has a hard time trying to find Robyn and an even harder time convincing her that their meant to be together. This book is really good at the begining, but is a bit slow in the middle. Other than that its a great read!"
3,enjoyable,"Enjoyable read. Simple writing style with a heavy religious leaning. Great period perspective of old Italy, codes of chivalry, miracles and personal belief systems."
4,Daphne's Book Review,"Zoe thought her best friend Natelie's book was a really great book. She thought it should be published. Natelie didn't want it to. She thought it was a bad idea. Zoe finally talked her into it. They dicided they needed a pseudonym name. Natelie was now Cassandra Day. She needed an agent, so Zoe was now Zee Zee. Their English teacher was their supervisor. She rented them an office, fax, and beeper number, so that when the agency would send them something, they would automatically get it. Natelie's mom was actually thier publisher, so that is why they needed to keep it a secret. After awhile, they finished the book. When the company sent them a contract, they wanted a lawyer to look over it, so they went to Zoe's dad. They told them everything, unless he wouldn't of looked it over. He said it was a fine contract, so they sent it in. They named the book, ""The Cheater."""
4,Book Publishing,"Since I've also had a book published, I found the information about the publishing industry to be fascinating."
3,I used to love this,I liked Corn Crunchems better before they re-formulated them. They now are kind of like eating straw with corn flavoring. I used to eat them every morning--not any more.
5,"Warmth, color and depth and autumnal intensity","There is no doubt in my mind that this one will be the new ""definitive"" recording for Eclairs sur l'au dela. I own the Chung - Orchestre de l'Opera Bastille recording on DG, and by all means, that one is not bad. But, no matter how much sympathy I have for Chung's efforts, there is a clear and inescapable difference when you hear the Berlin Phil versus the a French Opera Orchester. Especially in ""Demeurer dans L'amour"" and ""Le Christ, Lumiere du Paradis"", the unparalled string section of the Berlin Philharmonic offers much more urgency, authority and sonority, much more cushioning and velvet, much more warmth, color and depth, and a real autumnal intensity (Sir Simon is said to have declared that this work is Messiaen's Missa Solemnis), and thereby transcends this recording into a very different league of its own.Sometimes I feel though that the EMI engineering could be more spacious, but maybe this is just me..."
4,A Beautiful Sequel,"Beware that this is a sequel to Waylander. However as a sequel, this book goes above and beyond my expectations. It is classic Gemmell"
2,Disappointment,The leather car seat cushion turned out to be a disappointment. The idea is great but it does not stay in place properly. You have to make an adjustment everytime you get in and out of the car.Lynne Beaird in NC
2,If you have time and nerve...,"... you will want to set aside a good deal of time to try and absorb the many layers of this book. It is an attempt to cry out against female opression but is a failed attempt due to the complexity of layers that can only be absorbed by multiple reads. But the book is not good enough to reread and the comparisons are too far-fetched in an unpleasant way. Maybe I will change my mind tomorrow but I doubt it. Brown overvoices and fails her cause, making this novel an excellent example of 'camp' art.If you do read it, it must be read in order and the entire set of stories has to be read because they all relate to each other. The final story ties the previous stories toegther but really cannot stand alone. No single story here has the merit to stand alone but they work as a collection."
5,good gift,Well I got this panda bear for my girlfriend as a gift and she loved it. She even uses it as a pillow because it huge n soft.

5,Apocalypse Now Redux: A Screenplay,After reading the screenplay i watched the film over again to catch all the little stuff that went on in the background that I missed.
5,Extech DC400,"This is a great unit. Simple to use and the hold feature is invaluable.No wires to strip, no shunt to install, no stabbing of wires that can cause water intrusion. Simply clamp it on the wire, turn the unit on, zero it and turn the circuit on. How simple can it get?"
5,a Transmission filter..,"I bought this because I was buying a bunch of other WIX stuff at the same time.. I love the WIX products as they provide a decent quality product at a good price/value and least some of them are made here in the US (wish I could say all of them) -- I forgot to check whether this one was though.. Anyway, haven't yet installed it but it looks like it'll work just fine for our '85 Chevy.."
4,Wonderful!,"Wonderful. I was stirred by all the life events these characters go through growing up, and enjoyed my own walk down memory lane, as I read. Being a boomer myself, I remembered where I was and what I was doing, while reading this roller coaster story. Tesa Jones did a magnificent job of weaving the stories together and making my experience an emotionally charged ride. All those twists and turns, I loved it!"
4,CRANIAL OSTEOPATHS MUST HAVE THIS BOOK,Anyone serious about cranial osteopathy and the nuts and bolts of the head would be foolish to not have this book.It simply brings the anatomy alive and makes for more clarity in the mind of the practitioner. A worthy investment equal to owning the bones.
1,No hardware,"Not a single screw, bolt, allan wrench, etc. enclosed with this desk. The wood looked nice but getting it back into the box to return was like unscrambling an egg. Hopefully UPS will pick it up although I've been waiting for more than a day now. Amazon is paying for the return and that's a good thing."
4,Worth it.,"I finally broke down and bought this desk, after eyeing it for months. It went together in about 30 minutes, and I love the clean lines and light wood. The only problem I've had is that the plugs that fit over the recessed bolts keep falling out.Wait for it to go on sale! I got mine for $60 instead of $100, so I was also able to afford the hutch."
4,A great desk..to go with the DVD tower,"I got this desk a few months after buying the CD/DVD tower from the same collection. The single drawer limits the amount of stuff I can keep around, GOOD! The tray works and slides better than I thought it would, I keep my laptop stored there. It is pretty easy to take apart and put back together if you move from place to place. Sometimes I wish it had more depth to it."
1,Ball cracked 1st time used,Was very happy with the set until an hour into the first day playing the red ball cracked. Emailed company a week ago to see if they would replace it but have not heard anything back.
2,received defective,This set would be great except that I received 3 yellow balls and only one blue ball instead of two of each. I have emailed the company to see if they will do anything about it.
2,it was ok,"unless you are an avid historian, and like it when books go into extreme detail then I would not advise you to read this book."
5,it's outstanding,"I considered sending the authors a check, since this book has already been worth a half-dozen therapy sessions, and I'm not even finished. It's written clearly & intelligently. If everybody read this book with the loving care with which it's written, I think the world would be a saner place."
3,"It's alright, but...","The game was okay gameplay wise, but it was Hell on my computer. It used so much memory between the expansion and the original The Sims 2, and pretty much screwed me over if I want to upload any more expansions. The game itself works pretty well, but it causes my computer to crash every few minutes, to the point where I have to save more often in fear of losing my hard-earned simoleons and grades.The thing is; my computer didn't start crashing until after I got the game. Maybe twenty-five minutes into it, it froze up and I couldn't escape or ctrl-alt-del it. So, I had to reboot and restart.I'm not sure if I'm the only one that has this problem, or if it's just my computer, but I'm pretty sure I got a defective game.If you're a big fan of the series, I would deffinately recommend getting it. For those of you that didn't think it was so hot, you're not missing too much.Three stars overall."
4,To be honest it was a little boring,"This is Natasha Enya Luchow,it looked so fun but it wasn't what I was expecting.It was only college life.It wasn't a ""GIVE ME MORE"" game,it was a ""WHAT A SNORE"" game.It was ok."
4,Not bad yet could of done a bit better,It's a good game to play but not so much fun when you cant join your sim in their class and such yet the other stuff isnt so bad but i m still new to playing it as well but i do recommend to get the cheat for money because all the colleges are quite expensive but the only one that doesnt have a soritity is pleasentville the other ones do.
1,way too many bugs!,the expansion pack isnt bad in itself. but there are many gamestopping bugs and no patch. 129 known bugs.
3,Eh......,"This game was fun at first, but then slowly got worse and worse and worse.I thought the college was a neat idea, and i loved the dorms (except you cant build your own!!!) and the game had the right intentions, but really it was bad. It got soooo boring to do homework and write a paper. thats all you do to earn grades. I would not recrommend buying this game!"
5,"A ""Must-Buy""","If you enjoyed the sims2, then trust me when I state that you wouldn't want to not buy this game for the world! The sims2 Uni offers a brand new array of new objects and NPC's, from the evil mascot to new lounge chairs. It also offers a new age, the ""young adult"" age, which can only be obtained when your teen sim attends college. They also have added a variety of new career reward objects, starting from the cow plant, all the way to Dr. Vu's Home Plastic Surgery Kit. And, if that's not enough they've also thrown in a new little contraption called ""Influence"", which can also help your sims out on the road of life. The only thing I would would change if I could, would be to make campus life a tad bit shorter. Well, I hope that you found my review helpful, and I strongly urge you to buy the sims2 Uni, because I know that you'll enjoy it, as much as I do."
5,Gorgeous,"I can't say enought about this bookcase. I bought it because it's gorgeous and perfectly matches my decor. I brought it home and was able to assemble it myself in just 20 minutes. Even better, I didn't need power tools, just a regular Phillips screwdriver (I suggest using one with a large head, I used a smaller head at first and had minimal trouble, but had no problems at all with a bigger one.) The directions were easy to follow, well written. So far it's holding up wonderfully."
3,Dolce Walnut Bookcase,"I really like the Dolce collection. They match the rest of my furniture. Although I was dispointed that when I ordered them online they were delivered to me with scratches and pieces of wood missing. I will not return them due the fact that it is too much trouble in doing so, but I will suggest that you package your products in a more careful manner.Rowena"
5,Looks expensive.,"We were reluctant to buy this piece because of the low price. We figured it would look cheap. We went to the local Target to check it out, but the floor sample was scratched which did not boost our confidence. We shopped all over for bookcases with a similar contemporary urban style (which matches our other furntiture) but didn't find much. We decided to try this and see how it looks in our house. We bought three. Assembly was easy and they look great. They definitely look like they cost much more than they do. We are very pleased."
4,T.V. entertainment center idea,We bought 2 of these and placed one on either side of our big screen TV. It was much cheaper than the 3piece units you see and worked great. We couldn't fit the DVD or other surround sound equipment except the large sub woofer. But it was great for pictures and nick nacks. Assembly was quick we have a slight gap near the bottom on one side that we will have to live with. We also purchase the computer desk from this collection.It is wonderful even without the hutch. I hope it lasts through the four kids!!
5,Picking Up The Marbles--A Must Read!,"Wonderful summer and winter read. I loved absorbing into the rich flavors of Houston and Texas.

It makes me want to book a trip to Aruba right now!"
5,A Chocolate Pleasure and Low Calorie,"I have eaten these cookies for many years and I still enjoy them immensely. They are low-fat and made with cane juice, not refined sugar. They taste like a rich brownie or fudge. It is a desert that I can feel good about eating. 3 delicious cookies with a rich chocolate taste has only 125 calories.I had previously bought them at the local grocery and then they quit carrying them. I did not know they were available on Amazon and at about 2/3 the cost of what I was paying at the store. Also shipping from Amazon was amazingly fast."
5,Beautiful - like nothing I have ever heard before.,I heard parts of this CD on NPR on Christmas Eve and decided to buy the CD becuase it is just so lovely. I have never heard music like this before. I do not have a background in music and have no music education - but I do feel passionately about the music I bring into my enviroment. #26 Ave Maris Stella is what caught my attention on NPR and led me to buy the CD - I have never heard this combination of voice and instrument and it is ethereal - I feel transported to another time and place when it comes on. I love this CD. I see that new copies are very expensive - I hope someone reissues this music so others may enjoy in future gennerations.
2,Melted!,"First pair where the little nose pads and branches pads (in soft gummy plastic) simply MELTED ON ME! Was it because I had put some gel in my hair one sunny day, and wore the glasses in my hair that day? Can't tell but anyway: that really ruined the pair.I know that sounds like a joke but it is not. Sadly, besides, these are great frames and lenses."
1,the best part IS the finish,"I don't know what I looked forward to more-the end of our national nightmare that has been this fools reign over our country, or the end of this puff piece about W. I guess if you are just getting out of a decade long coma then you could swallow the premise of this joke of a film, and swallow is just what the creator of this dvd would do if he was left alone with our ""great"" President any longer."
1,BS,We shouldn't glorify anything about this jackass. Thank God there's less than one year of him left.
1,Bush League,"A compelling story about a corrupt and misguided president coming from one of the most laughable ""news"" agencies ever to exist. Now that's something worth owning!"
5,GAPS,this book is excellent with lots of information and easy to readAs a physician this book adds to the nutritional doctors new insights into treatments.
2,the animals and whoom?,"This is a mix of The animals,and Eric Burton and the new animals.The new animals,someone sings half of theese songs in a deep abnoctios voice which sounds like crap on background vocals as well,which almost ruins the songs."
5,Great duvet cover,"Good value for money. Nice and soft, pretty color. I expect this will last through many washings."
2,Not picture books in this edition,"I purchased this book for my 15 month old son because I had such fond memories of Little Golden Books from my own childhood. At such a young age, my son needs to have pictures to follow the story - and this book is missing 90% of the pictures!!!! Each story is crammed into one or two pages, and the pictures, if they are shown at all, are out of order and tiny! I am returning this book, a little wiser about children's book ""collections"". Final analysis - the book is okay if you are an adult who just wants the nostalgia of the old Golden Book stories, but definitely not for young children."
4,Nice to see things in Motion,A nice DVD to get started. It was a pleasant change to see the techniques in motion instead of just seeing still pictures like in many of the books and magazines I've purchased. I learnt a few paddling techniques that alone were worth the price of the video.
5,"Sex, Priests, and Secret Codes: The Catholic Church's 2,000-Year Paper Trail of Sexual Abuse","This book is an enlightening look at the issues behind the sexual abuse of children in the Catholic Church and the failure of leadership to adequately deal with the problem, both decades ago and today. Doyle presents a candid view of the motives behind the decisions that have taken place behind the cloak of secrecy that surrounds the clerical culture. The book is well written, easy to read and easily understand. I highly recommend it to all Catholics."
4,An excellent textbook for this rapidly changing field.,"Adami's book is the first comprehensive review of issues pertinent to the field of artificial life. The book is a textbook based on his lectures at CalTech. Some of the topics are a bit brief (Turing machines are summarized in four pages) but that is to be expected for a book whose goal is to integrate concepts from the fields of biology, chemistry, statistics, computer science, information science, etc. I found the book fascinating and Chris includes a CD-rom and several chapters on the Avida simulation developed at CalTech. There are numerous references and problems at the end of each chapter."
2,"slower than a ""gold"" 12c","for the record, i have the 19, the 17BII, and an older ""gold"" 12c. i was thrilled to find hp finally upgraded the venerable 12c. about time they spruced up their cash cow and made it more powerful than the average digital watch, right? i was absolutely stunned to discover that the platinum 12c is actually SLOWER than the gold 12c on time value of money (TVM) calcs. trust me, i have been the subject of much derision at the office for my re-dubbed ""silver"" 12c. i imagine for most of wall street, getting algebraic notation and losing what sluggish performance it had is a BAD trade. certain TVM calcs that are instant on the 17BII (a calculator over a decade old) takes 30+ seconds on the new 12c. shame on hp for continuing to abuse its captive audience of finance professionals."
1,"TERRIBLE, Don't Bother with this HP-12C, Stick with Original","Not an improvement at all over the the original HP-12C, it is much slower for solving for YTM or IRR. Try solving for the YTM on a bond, it now takes about 36 seconds on the Platinum 12-C, versus only about 17 seconds on the original 12-C, versus only 3 seconds on the HP-10B. Totally unacceptable, DON'T BOTHER!!! Buy the original 12C, DO NOT BUY THIS CALCULATOR, YOU WILL REGRET IT.I love HP calculators, I own about 6 of them, but this is the WORST possible ""improvement"" in the history of HP. Avoid this calcuator."
1,Disappointingly poor quality HP product,"The older HP12C model was a much better quality product. My ""old"" HP 12C finally died after 22 years of use - one of the originals. I could not believe the poor quality of this calculator. I'll be surprised if it lasts a year. It feels like a piece of tin. Everything about it is shabby worksmanship. If I had been able to first try it in a store rather than buy it online I would never have bought it - and certgainly not for what I paid for it. I would not have bought it even if the price were $10. Within seconds of operating this ""new"" HP 12c I new it was junk."
4,The Best 12C yet -- but it should have trig functions,"I am an HP calculator collector and math major. I bought this to add to my collection.They have improved the memory on this new HP-12C and added algebraic (a step backward in my opinion, as RPN and the Enter key are superior to algebraic), but they should have added SIN, COS, and TAN and the other trig functions to this updated version.The keys do not have as good of feel as older HP-12Cs, but they are still in the decent category. Is this the last new HP calculator? They have discontinued the great HP-48 series. Carly Fiorina is killing HP."
4,"Not their greatest, but still great!!","I agree with a lot of the previous reviewers that this isn't the best Orb effort and maybe doesn't have some of the 'fun' that previous discs had. Also, since some of these tracks have been previously released as singles (my biggest complaint would be ANOTHER version of 'Cold Harbour'? For big Orb fans this would be the 3rd or 4th cd it's appeared on!!)it lacks the flow of previous albums. That said, it's a great collection of all of what the Orb does best, great ambient, fabulous beat-driven techno, and some experimental flourishes. And if you saw the US tour that they did recently, it's clear that they are still into what they do (at last at the Brooklyn gig) and among the best live acts in the genre. I'll continue to buy anything the Orb releases, and 'Okie Dokie...' is certainly a quality addition to their incredible catalog!"
1,long ship time,"I wish I could say how the pan worked. I purchased it June 2, 2006. As of July 4, 2006 and I had not received it. It is now July 17th and I just received notification that the item is going to be delayed until the middle of August! Buy this pan somewhere else."
1,Can't Judge a Book by its Cover,No offence to some of Joan's past or more recent books but I personaly felt that this book could have been better. I read this book for a book report for English 9 and felt that if I wouldn't have read this book I probably would have done better because the book left me bored and did not keep me captivated.
1,Don't Buy This Edition,"There is no Book 2 on Kindle for this specific edition.Buy a complete ""The Eye of the World"" for Kindle and save yourself the 99 cents for a cup of tea."
2,"to low, not adjustable",I bought to save a buck! it is to low for tall people . Also it needs lots of weight if you actually hit your bag. so if your short and are a lightweight buy this.
4,Seem Healthy - Not A Great Taste,"It seems like everyone is more or less in agreement that these are a great healthy snack, but are split between them being good tasting or not. I for one do not mind the taste, however they are not overly delicious by any means. What I have been doing is spreading either humus, or the low fat Laughing Cow cheese wedges on them. Either one adds enough flavor to make them pretty good, and a serving of each is a nice, healthy, under 200 calorie snack."
1,Dont waste your money,I was told by my doctor to try these for stress and anxiety. It was a waste of money. Just one more thing to go in the bottom of my bathroom drawer.
4,A little out of date but ever useful,"The book was written in 1980 and so it's quite out of date. But still an excellent reference guide for runner who are visiting or moving to Canada. Has some excellent ideas for running routes and though it may have changed a bit, with a little imagination, you could use this to plan your runs.A very very useful book for runners."
3,"good, but not as pictured","I bought this to go with my SE electronics USB2200A mic so I could set it on my bookshelf while recording. I needed a stand with a 3/8 inch male thread and this has it in the picture. Unfortunately, the product arrives with the larger 5/8 inch thread. I ordered an adapter part for 1.95 plus shipping and the stand works well. I also realized that my mic had an adapter part built in, so yours might too? Anyway, it's annoying not getting the item as pictured."
5,Washed up? No way dude!,"Tim's book is amazing, especially if you've ever been an aspiring rock star. Here we meet a character who has fame and fortune but no happiness and has to reconcile his past with his present. The tale is well told with a spark that many books lack. This is a winner for sure!"
1,Not Comfortable at all!,Three people tried this cushion. Results were the same...very uncomfortable cushion!!I have ongoing back problems. Sitting for long periods of time is difficult. This cushion did nothing to help. I returned the item. I will still try to find something that works.
4,Nice tush cush,"I received this cushion quickly and it looked exactly like the picture in Amazon. So far, it makes the sitting feel better. It will take a bit of time to determine whether it helps with my leg and back pain."
2,Too firm for my buns!,"And I have a lot of bun! I purchased this because I prefer seating that's on the firmer support side, but this surface actually hurts. I'm giving it 2 starts because it is a well-made product."
1,Large for some but not all,"This item is LARGE only for little people, a group to which I have no hopes of ever belonging. It's smaller than any of my chair seats and is smaller than my, pardon the expression, large butt. If you are a big man like me (or woman too, I must add) do not buy this cushion expecting any kind of relief. It's too small to do you any good and might make things worse."
4,"Great for desk chair, not for car seat","this cushion is a big help for severe tailbone pain. I use it at work and it's great. I bought a second one for my car and it's just too big to use, even for an SUV seat. Very firm and it keeps its support and I'm a big person. Would definitely recommend this product."
2,Far too large--my butt falls into the huge space.,"This looked great. But it's HUGE! Certainly too big to carry into a meeting and far exceeding any brief case. When I sit at my desk, I need my ""sit-bones"" to be steady to support me, but they fall in this cavernous hole that spreads as if to swallow a small child (this the strap to prevent from opening all the way). My sit-bones are unsupported, while my exterior thigh bones bear the weight. Very, very uncomfortable for me.If you weigh under 200, I suggest you try something else. And look for something smaller and more discreet if you want something you can take with you."
3,Don't buy it for the wedge effect.,"I am a physical therapist who was looking for a wedge-shaped cushion that I could recommend to my patients who need help keeping their spine in a neutral alignement while sitting. This wedge does NOT fit the bill, despite a product descrition that says ""Wedge shape (slant from the back 3"" down to 1/2"" in the front) tilts your pelvis forward to restore your spine's natural lumbar lordotic curve.""Forget it. The cushion is too compressible to hold the wedge shape, especially since most people have more weight at the back of the cushion than at the front. So, the cushion basically bottoms out in the back.I imagine it will work fine to relieve pressure on the coccyx, but I have not used it for that."
4,Relief at last,"Been sitting on my Tush cush for a few days and one thing I don't like is the way its tapered in the front. Might not be a problem for the ladies but for this man it has a tendency to push you forward and right over your manly junk. Which become unbearable after awhile, so I solved the problem by turning it around and now I use the cutout for more important things"
2,Innefective cushion,"I bought the cushion because the description specifically mentioned use for heavier individuals. I found the cushion to be too hard and uncomfortable. Although it did provide relief on my tail bone, it was not enough to overcome the general discomfort of the cushion."
5,Nice heater,"Great heater. As far as I can tell, many people can't figure out how to set the center dial. Which is great because I think it pushed the price down. So here's a hint... Push all the little red switches out! Then the heating function will always be on. If you push some in, you will be using the 24 hour timer and it will be on for whichever part of the 24 hours you have them pushed out for.The timer function does mean that the heater makes a constant clicking noise when it's on, whether the heat/fan is on or off, because it's keeping time. And there's no off switch. So you have to tip it over to make it shut up when it's not heating (there's a ""safety switch"" on the bottom so it turns off if it tips over.) If you are not extremely impatient or a bumpkin, then you will be able to figure out how this heater works, and it will be well worth the low price. I am very happy with it."
4,Toasty Warm,I bought this for my daughters bedroom that has no heating at all. I live in NY and it has been extreemly cold this winter. It keeps her room VERY warm. A great little heater.
3,The newer version puts this one to shame,"The newer Dengar figure is a lot better. Lots more articulation, more detailed gear and paint job, etc. Check out my review atStar Wars 2010 Vintage Collection Action Figure Dengar."
3,A valuable reference book,"Full of useful information and great stories and background material, marred only by insufficient copy-editing... there are many errors and mistakes in the formatting. I'd recommend the printed version (I'm assuming it does not have the same mistakes the ebook version does). It would be a 5-star book if not for the formatting problems.I've been a fan of the DC-3 for many years. I frequently ""fly"" one in various flight simulators."
3,Sexy,"I'm happy about my purchase, however would buy another brand next time. The fit wasn't as its shown in the picture -the sleeves only come to my elbow. My arms are long, but not that long. The body fit is more pleasing, so I'll wear it."
3,Skin allergy,"You may want to wash it first. Almost immediately my skin started itching when I put it on. I don't know if it was just my skin and an allergic reaction to the material it is made of, but because of it, I haven't even worn it yet and I bought it a year ago."
3,"Great paper, binding, but cover a bit floppy","These are good notebooks- quality paper, ultrafine perforations, and a spiral binding that works really well. However, the 'semi rigid' polypropylene cover is really pretty floppy. I greatly prefer the hardcover notebooks from the same manufacturer."
2,Great Notebook,"I ordered the hardcover, however I received the Poly Cover notbook. I ended up gaving the Poly cover one to my daughterand now its her favorite. They are incredibly durable, thick pages! The hardcover notebooks are incredibly elegant, in fact, once I am done with the notebook I place it in my office library, A. so I can reference old notes and B. because it adds to the decor in the office. LOVE LOVE LOVE this brand."
2,Not Satisfied in the City,"First of all, it arrived broken. One of the plastic hooks that holds the swinging door on was broken off, so I haven't been able to use the door. Because of this, there is constantly litter everywhere. What a mess. I was not happy with my purchase."
3,Not quite what I thought,"I am disappointed that the ""stainless"" steel is not quite as stainless as I believed it would be. When I boil water in one of the pots I am left with a waterline/water marks in the pot. I also noticed that, after leaving the pot and cover in water, the rivets(?) holding the handle to the cover seemed really affected by the water - they lost their shine and I wouldn't be suprised to see rust stains appear. So now, for the covers at least, I have to make sure that they are not sitting in water.Also, water takes much longer to boil in one of these pots than in any other pot I have owned.However, I would say that the pots seem to be well made and I expect them to last a long time. They are a decent first pot set."
3,Very Noisy,"As with the previous reviewer, I was shocked at how loud the unit is. I just hooked mine up yesterday and it is still humming/grinding away. The weight is not a problem since it was expected - there IS a battery in the unit, so it will be heavy. Regarding the shipping condition - with one terminal being unattached - I do agree - APC should determine a better way to allow easier hookup and reinsertion of the terminal. HOWEVER, the most important thing is that it works! Which it does - after several tests today (unplugging from wall, etc..). This is an adequate UPS - nothing really special. If you are ready to withstand a constant whirring, then go ahead and buy this UPS, because it does work."
2,Mine died in 2 months,"I bought this particular model because all the good reviews that I read. However, my unit quit working in 2 months. The LED is still green, and when you unplug it from the wall outlet it still makes loud beeps. But it won't power up the things connected. I heard other people have the same problem and it might be related to the batteries.I returned mine yesterday, but since it's over 30 days old, I can't get the reimbursement for the shipping cost.In conclusion, I can't recommand this thing, although I know APC is supposed to be a company that makes quality products. You may need to try another model."
5,"By far, his favorite toy!",My boy got this from his teen sister when he was 6 months old and now at 2 1/2 he is still playing with it and loves it dearly. I see how much it costs now and I can't believe it! My daughter bought it at [...] for [...]! It is the big one too! It is a great toy.
3,it is just so so,"I bought this set a couple of weeks ago for my wife. It is not as good as most people claimed here. Today my wife showed me there are quite some spots(stains) inside the small pot at the bottom after only one use. I tried washing it again and again and the spots just would not go away. The sauce pan also scratched my flat top stove (well, for this I can probably blame my stove is too delicate, but my old pan did not have such a problem)."
3,You can find everything everything inside,"Ideas, ideas and ideas. Thats what the book lack. It attempts to provide a blueprint of how to market a professional service company, without giving much useful ideas on how to do it, and more lacking is how to implement the few ideas it provides. Will be useful for planning, and not ideas generation."
1,The Cat Who,I now own all of the Cat Who books and have read them all. I was sad to here that there won't be any more.
3,What Would Joey Do?,I did not like the book in the beging. In the middel fo the book it did not stay interesting. The argguing between hi parints went on and on and on in the book so it made it boring. The part i liked was when Joeys mom was runing a round to case his dad a way then she could not case him a way so she puta broom stick in his wheel then the bike flipet over then he flew into a branch and the branch went right through him. I gave the book a 3 star rating because it could have been better.
4,Fun for kids and adults!,This is a neat little toy. Shoot pretty far and is alot safer for kids than a real paintball gun. Got this for my dad before getting him a real one to practice with.. even though he has a real paintball gun now he still keeps this one becuase its still fun!
3,disappointed teacher,"Very disappointed to find that this ""book"" did not ""sing"" the complete nursery rhyme.Very good concept,colorful,easy to handle. The complete rhyme is printed on the page but most toddlers do not read.Would have been much more age appropriate to verbalize the complete rhyme."
2,This isn't funny,"I have always enjoyed Christie Ridgway's humor--I've read everything she's written. She has every right to strike out in a different direction but the cover of the book shouldn't be a cartoon promising a romp--not that that is Ms. Ridgway's fault.The hero and heroine begin as very interesting characters. I loved the description of the heroine and what she was like at the beginning. Then she changed, became dull, wandering.This book almost seems like an very early effort (obviously unpublished) with a rewritten and excellent beginning and a great ending. In between, there is a lifeless secondary plot and little resolution of the heroine's problem with her father.If you want to enjoy a good read, try her other books."
2,Not quite catching...,"The anime itself is decently drawn, but the plot leaves much to be desired. Your mind isn't allowed to imagine too much with this anime. It was dry when it came to humor, which I need something to lighten the mood a little. Of course, it could just not be ""my style."""
4,Good Bible,"I also have a hardback copy that is very large, but my Kindle version goes everywhere with me. Not to mention, the hardback copy fell apart from the binding."
5,Worth reading - make sure you read the series in order.,What a great way to leave the work world. Let Mr Lumley wisk you off into an environment of deadly make believe. Lots n' lots of plot. Riverting characters. Down right frightning!!!! Make sure you read the series in order!
2,"Some Good Moments, but mostly forgettable","This album would be a much better product if it wasn't for David Lee Roth's presence on it. He can't sing bluegrass. Some of the other tracks feel kind of forced as well. However this is the rare disc of ""bluegrass covers"" that actually features some quality Progressive Bluegrass acts contributing, not just session players putting ""twang"" in their voices.Blue Highway and Mountain Heart do excellent jobs reinterperting ""I'll Wait"" and ""Dance The Night Away"". The John Cowan Band also shines on ""Runnin' With the Devil"". And David Grisman turns ""Hot for Teacher"" into a jazz swing instrumental that's on par with all his work.This album could have been better."
1,Ha Ha Ha,"Good for a laugh. This is the most ridiculous sounding thing i ever heard. Roths voice and bluegrass dont mix. Sounds like cottage cheese in a glass of bourbon. Gotta hand it to em though, still living off the moment. Diamond dave i am still a fan. Dont be hatin."
3,Missing the Balance,"The book is full of breath-taking pictures and awesome poetry, but for beginners its a big no-no. Due to lack of illustrations of movements in detail, a novice may just think Taiji is all about following your body, which in turn may make the learning of forms difficult. The approach of AlHuang to Taiji will be of tremendous help to people who have already fluent with their forms. To make myself more clear - say if you know the small circle form, then you may use such books to make them more fluent and dancelike by following your body which already ""knows"" how to do the form. For beginners - NO!. This is where the author misses the ""Balance"" between form and formlessness. Though the ""Essence"" or ""Principle"" behind Taiji is formless, it is only through form that we can begin to learn to implement this principle. So if you think you don't need the details of forms then go ahead and buy or else? Don't!!!"
1,Skip It,"I cannot in good faith recommend this toy. It is not capable of projecting bright or legible images of the stars at any distance exceeding a foot or two. Add to that the fact that the projected start map is a negative image (black stars on a white background) and the halogen bulb is a bright distraction, and you have a very poor excuse for a planetarium projector. The booklet is thin and contains nothing that can't be found in any children's astronomy book -- in fact, it contains less information. The part of this product we got any use from was the cassette: we played it while viewing images on a PC planetarium program.My kids got this toy as a gift, but you can find much better astronomy toys for children. Skip this one."
5,Great Delivery,"What other singers like Whitney Houston, & Celine Dione don't realize is that a truly great love song isn't the place to show off your voice. Sometimes I think they believe that their vocals are more important than the song. Really it's the heart and feeling put into it. Nobody delivers a love song as well as Sir Elton John. For that matter, nobody writes a better love song either."
3,A VERY Supplemental Greatest Hits Collection,"Someone as clever as Elton John, with such an acute sense of song structure, is poorly served by genre songs collection. Like his pop music forebears, the Beatles, Elton mixed loud and soft, fast and slow, campy and sentimental to form his musical persona.His signature songs here (""Your Song,"" ""Daniel,"" ""Someone Saved My Life Tonight"") are best heard within their original albums (or 1974's Greatest Hits collection, which fit the same mold). The live remakes (""Candle In The Wind,"" and ""Don't Let The Sun Go Down On Me,"" both Top 10 hits) seem hammy compared to the already grandiose originals. By the time Elton got back to basics with ""Believe,"" ""Blessed,"" and the two new songs, the damage was done.No one needs more soft ballads, especially a collection of them, from Elton John. Instead, the rockers from his long career should be gathered to remind us (and him)of all Elton John hoped to be as a performer -- and for the better part of 20 years, was."
2,I think it's a little boring.,It is sort of dull and it needs some more excitment ....it doesnt make me want to hear more of his songs. It makes my mind ander away and doesn't keep my attention well.
4,"Finally, a single-disc career retrospective","I am partial to Elton John's early years. I am going back to 'Madman Across The Water,' 'Goodbye Yellow Brick Road,' 'Tumbleweed Connection,' etc. But I bought this set one day, and I sure am happy I did!The remastering is great. In translation, the sound quality is excellent. And, you get 15 great songs from the rock legend. But, I'm not crazy about several songs on the record ('We Could Make History' and 'Circle Of Life' to name a few), which is why I give this four stars.If you're a huge Elton John fan and you've loved him all of his career and you had to buy just one CD, I'd buy this one. And, you get some great live tracks. 'Don't Let The Sun Go Down On Me' is a great live duet with pop icon George Michael, and 'Candle In The Wind,' taken from the 'Live In Australia' record, is amazing as well.This is highly recommended for the casual or new Elton John fan. ENJOY!!!"
3,Great songs but little continuity as a total package,"Elton is in my top five all time favorites. Hit after hit after hit. But sometimes Elton shops at K-mart. This collection has some great songs, in fact, they're all great tunes. Just without any sense of purpose as a collection. Glad to have some of those late 80's and 90's songs on one CD. I just wish he would show the early Elton of the early 70's when he releases a CD collection. Like most CD's, I click on the ones worth listening to and delete those I don't want to include. I much prefer hearing his 70's songs with the original release."
4,This book rocks!,"This is a clever, well-written book that will likely put your mind at ease if you are anxious about Perl 6. Scott makes interesting and intellegent comments, and provides good code samples. This book should appeal to Perl programmers of any skill level, and is not as dry as most programming books. An enjoyable read!"
5,Glycerin Free Yippee!,"Actually there are two other toothpastes on the market that are glycerin free. This one tastes the best and is my favorite though. The other two are great too though, they are Miessence & Earthpaste which are flouride & SLS free too. I alternate with the three. Using the same toothpaste all the time gets a bit boring."
5,This is a quirky and interesting book,and the best part of it is not the part where Jim Thompson disappears. The best part of the book is the description of living and working in Bangkok between WWII and the beginnings of the Vietnam war. It gives great descriptions of Bangkok as a village with smelly but peaceful canals. Thompson himself is the kind of man we are looking toward to help people in other third world countries make real businesses and create competitive markets.Jim Thompson nurtured a small cottage industry of silk weavers into what is now a multinational corporation. Fascinating book.
4,lovely toy,"Love it! bought one here in UK 9 years ago for our first son and it went everywhere with us. we then past it on to friends 5 years ago and their children love it too. After having 3rd child recently we looked everywhere for a replacement but found we could only get in US. Really pleased to have got it now, the music is soothing and not at all tinny. A great toy!"
3,A baby has problems making this toy play music,"I bought this toy for the second time for a grandchild because the music is beautiful and beautifully done. However, it takes an older child or an adult to make the music start playing. You really have to push on the nose to get it to start. The amount of effort necessary makes it useless for baby. My granddaughter is 7 months old so maybe when she is older it will be more fun for her."
2,Not as promised,"We were looking for a bedtime-friendly version of the Baby Einstein take-along-tunes. Online the product description said that the toy plays music for 6 minutes continuously on lullaby mode which is what I was looking for. Once we received the toy, the instructions said that it plays for only one minute on one mode and the other mode creates a ""symphony"" with three touches (but not for 6 minutes). However, in reality, it only plays each tune for about 10-15 seconds. And I can't tell any difference between the 2 modes. That said, our daughter likes the other parts of it that she can chew on, etc. However, I suggest that you save your money and get the ""Baby Einstein Take Along Tunes"" which has the same high quality classical music, plays longer and is only about $8.00. Our daugther LOVES the Baby Einstein and is only marginally interested in this new one."
1,Doesn't Deliver,"This is one of the most expensive and underwhelming toys we've received. It doesn't play one instrument, then a symphony or whatever it says. It just plays a clip, then another clip (yes I used both modes). It's ridiculous. Also - the off button doesn't actually work - it's supposed to be on the volume button (off - low - high), but instead, in a feat of remarkable unmanaged manufacturing, it's on the mode switch -- and it doesn't actually ever turn off. I suppose the only good thing about this toy is the big yellow face and the usual set of squishy/squeaky things to grope."
5,Characters in Sawyerton Springs Are Found in Every Small Town In The USA,"Andy Andrews has that special ability to make his characters ""come alive"". Being from a small town in VA. it was so much fun to read along and be able to visualize a person in ""my hometown"" as one of his characters. Loved Andy Andrews style and topic!"
2,Same book,"This is the same book as a new release""Return to Sawyerton Springs"". I wish I had known this before ordering. That fact maybe should be mentioned."
5,The memoir of an innocent teenage musician who learned the hard way about the dog eat dog world of big bands,"Diary of a Young Musician is the memoir of an innocent teenage musician who learned the hard way about the dog eat dog world of big bands: drugs, drinking, women, and road life. In his 20's he played with name bands and even served in an air force band during the Korean War., as well as earning a B.S. from the State University NY Potsdam. While working in Reno's showrooms, he married a professional dancer, an event that would change his life forever. His story is a pull-no-punches look at the ups and downs of band life in the mid-twentieth century, a life of excitement, wonder, trepidation, and challenges both internal and external. Highly recommended."
2,"Take my clock, please.","I have a couple complaints about this clock. I am a very light sleeper. I set the alarm to turn the radio on at a very low volume. However, there is a VERY loud internal switch that clicks just as the radio/alarm is being turned on. For me, it's like being awakened by someone slamming an encyclopedia on a tile floor. I actually contacted RCA's customer service about this. They told me ""that's just the way it is"". My second coplaint is about the large display. It has a dim control, but even on the low setting, it is way too bright. If you're a sound sleeper who doesn't mind having a bright light shining on your face, it could be the clock for you."
5,An eye opener about FDA and Pharmaceutical companies!,"As a prescriber of medication, it's horrifying to know that pharamaceutical reps are pushing dangerous drugs down the throat of the prescriber and the public. This book opened my eyes and makes me much more cautious when prescribing medicines that have not been on the market very long. It's difficult to explain to patients why they may not really want the ""new"" drug on the market. This book does that for us!"
3,"Cute, but edges don't want to stick!","My husband and I just put up the border in our son's nursery. For looks, it gets 5 stars. For application, 0 stars. Our edges won't stick either. We will have to buy wallpaper glue, like some of the other people. It must just be hit or miss with the quality. It is darling!"
4,Not as bad as they say,"While it wasn't a cake-walk to put up this border, I didn't find it to be quite as difficult as the other reviewers did. At first I tried using large strips of the border and putting it up all at once. Doing this resulted in the same problems others reported. Then I started cutting it into smaller strips (about 3 - 4 feet each). I carefully cut along places in the border that were easy to line up once they were placed on the wall (you can't even tell where I cut now that it is dry). I also made sure and soaked the border in water slightly longer than the 10 seconds recommended on the instructions. After soaking, I unrolled the boarder as I pulled it out of the water, leaving the inside of the roll in the water until the end, so that all of the glue was exposed to water at some point in the process.It was well worth the effort - very adorable in our nursery!"
3,Didn't do much for me,"Of course this product is a good price because its on amazon, but it really didn't do anything for me. It didn't have any negative effects on me either. If you're looking for that miracle product that is going to get you out of some depression. I would suggest get off the booze, cigarettes and exercise. I would even try to quit caffeine, if all that doesn't work, go to the doc and get some wellbutrin, but still stay off the booze, cigs and caffeine and exercise."
2,Chest Pain & Heart Palpitations,I took one pill (200 mg) daily instead of two daily. I thought I was feeling a bit better emotionally--(I also did start praying a whole BUNCH more than usual because the distress of daily depression and anxiety was sooo overwhelming and incredible to bare anymore). I did not stay on the regiment for a full week because after a few days I noticed that I couldn't sleep and my heart would palpitate at night along with significant chest pain on the left side and feeling strange mentally. I did some more research and saw that a lot of other people were experiencing these same side effects that I had. Not even more than two days after I stopped taking Sam-E I started feeling better. I stuck with the small dose of Xanax each day for a while but have weaned off of it. I'm a Christian and I'm praying and believing for a breakthrough for me...and things are improving--Thank God! I hope they improve for you too :) God Bless.
5,Life changing,"I read about Sam-e in a book called Stop Depression Now, written by an M.D. and a PHd. I bought this product at a local Rite-Aid for a friend of mine who was so depressed that he couldn't work or function, and was borderline suicidal. Within a couple days, he said he didn't feel suicidal anymore. Within a week, he was back to taking care of himself, laughing and joking, has renewed interest in things he liked to do, and is now back to work!! He is like a different person! He started telling all his friends about it that are taking Prozac with no results. I'm amazed at the major changes and so quickly. He doubled up on this so is taking 800mg a day. According to the book, you would start out at 400mg per day, if no results within a week, then up it to 800mg. Like the books says, you also need a good B vitamin complex in addition to this. I gave him a really effective sublingual B tablet that makes a big difference for me also."
4,Think it works,"I am 30 yrs old and ordered this for depression and anxiety. I really don't know if it is power of suggestion that I have read so many positive reviews, but I have been taking it about a month and feel more even keeled now. I feel like I have more ""happy"" days than I used to and less freak outs. Who knows if it is a coincidence or if I was taking a placebo if I could have the same result, but I know I will continue to take this. Downside is that it is spendy! Previously I was taking St. Johns wort which I don't think helped me."
2,The price is the problem...,"I love SAM-e!It turned me from a guy who had a handicapped sticker (and needed it) to someone who can walk for miles and leg press 300 pounds in the gym. It (and only it, I made no other changes) saved me a second knee replacement in 2002.I still use it every day, taking 400 mg each morning and evening. Why two stars? I'm trying to get your attention. This price is excessive.My local Sam's Club sells the Schiff brand for about [...] plus tax for 100 of the 200 mg caplets (equivalent to 50 of the Nature Made). I'm confident that Costco at least matches that.Puritan's Pride, who I have used for years [...], always has some kind of sale going on. Today (5/5/09) they are doing a buy-one-get-one selling 60 (sixty) 400 mg shrink-wrapped capsules for [...]. If you buy two, you get another three for a total of 150 caplets for [...]. Their shipping is about five bucks.SAM-e is a spectacular supplement, but I don't want you to pay inflated prices!"
1,Buyer Beware,"Same problem as reviewer Stephen D. What a shoddy table. Be prepared to buy four screws.From Stephen D.: ""The table came with a printed parts list. The list had been altered by hand and guess what, that part ""F"" , a bolt, does not screw into the table. Handwritten says M9x25 (I think )but it isn't very clear.""Besides the screws being the wrong ones, the four pieces in the middle don't appear to align either.I bought the matching chairs and loved the craftmanship on those. What happened here?? Would rate lower than 1 star if able to.Update: You will need 4 9mm bolts. Box stores sell 8mm and 10mm, but found them at nearby hardware store. Strathwood sent me 4 useless 8mm bolts."
3,Insightful but dry,"A few pages into this book it occurred to me that it must be written by a college professor since it was text-book dry. Sure enough, not one, but two of them.Having said that, it is loaded with an insightful peek into a specific region of our country during a very specific time. A good read for anybody interested in the history of the mountains of North Caroilina."
1,HUH?,"What the hell is the point of this? It sounds terrible. The vocals are tired, express none of the freshness of the original records--how could they?? If you're going to do a cover song, for crissakes, bring something new to the party. This record is a complete waste of time--yours, if you buy it, and the sm'eens for recording it."
5,Meet The Fun!,I've had this CD since release and it has yet to leave my 5 disc changer!The Smithereens were able to capture the spirit of the original Beatles release without any smaltz. Was it absolutely necessary to remake a Beatles classic? Of course not. Is this CD essential to any music collection?ABSOLUTELY!!!
3,Lovely Panda Book,"This book has a message to its story -- baby panda is born, lives in idyllic bamboo forest with mother, encounters noisy lumberjacks, must leave forest for new, unpolluted home -- but the illustrations are lyrical and lovely and the message so understated that it doesn't feel heavy-handed at all. It was a big hit with my 5 year old."
3,Difficult read,I couldn't get thru this book from the little I did read it seemed to refer to the Q often and from what I understand there isn't any proof that it existed. Beyond that I couldn't get thru this book it was too tedious. I think the average reader wouldn't enjoy this book it appears to be more for a college student who needs to write a paper on this subject.
4,"Mikala Women's Penny Woven Flower Sandal,Brown Multi","This is a great looking shoe and such a bargain over the retail cost. One problem, it seemed to stretch rather easily making them unwearable after one season."
2,Predictable view,"This is a poorly conceived tit-for-tat revenge film reminiscent of Changing Lanes with an Unlawful Entry backdrop. It was okay for first half but pretty quickly you can tell this not headed toward any satisfactory ending and sure enough, it doesn't deliver. Disappointing and of course not recommended."
5,Very Good Movie,"The plot and concept of this movie was really good. I am a big fan of Samuel Jacksons work, he is a great actor. This is one that could be watched over and over."
1,"Simplistic, poorly written plot with agnozing frustration.","Samuel L. Jackson's movies are hit or miss. This movie didn't even attempt to shoot at the target. I swear that the writers from Jackson's other piss-poor movie ""Changing Lanes"" were running out of ideas, and so to keep under budget re-tweaked the script to make this abomination. Instead of Jackson and Affleck going at it in rush hour traffic, you have the same tension, swapped out for a neighborhood dual. It's not there aren't redeeming qualities found within the plot line or character development, but it's just that the movie comes together so poorly in its plot, providing one that barely is a poor excuse for a movie."
1,dvd missing from case,"I recieved my order and notice the plastic wrapping had been torn, thinking it must have happened during packing I just put it aside till I had time to watch the movie, about a week later. I removed the remainer of the plastic to open the case and in doing so i discovered the dvd wasn't in the case. It appears that someone creased the plastic to remove my dvd. More quality checks need to be done before shipping. I have sent two emails requesting a replacement but have yet heard from amazon. The dvd in question is Lakeview Terrace."
5,Not happy with the movie,The movie arrived as expected and was in excellant condition.I did not like the content of the movie but only because I have a strong tie to religion.
3,"WORTH WATCHING FOR JACKSON, BUT WE'VE SEEN IT ALL BEFORE! 3 1/2 STARS!","This film is easy to watch for fans of such things, but I couldn't help but feel I had seen this film before. It's predictable and annoying at times, but Jackson's over the top performances keeps you interested. Whenever you have a plot like this it's very hard to please everyone, because everyone would react differently in this situation. I also found the relationship between Wilson and Washington to be very unrealistic and found myself amazed at how these two people could have gotten married in the first place. If you like Jackson( and I know you do!)You might want to check it out, but keep your expectations in check!"
5,Going deeper,"Very neat read...especially for all those interested in the process of change / reality perception...and all those studying NLP.This book clarifies how we code our reality, if you will. A good companion to NLP books on Modeling.A basic understanding of NLP is suggested prior to reading Metaphors in Mind, yet it keeps a pretty simple tone and clarifying language to go deep into the subject. When I read this, I new I had outgrown my therapist.All those studying or working as therapists / counselors can also draw a lot of useful info from this book."
4,Basic and reasonably priced,"Basic white porcelain cups for single espressos. Pretty minimalist, seem pretty durable after a month or two of regular use, reasonably priced. No complaints."
5,Best buy EVER!,"I purchased this for my son, 15 months and he loves it! It's a nice size so it helps teach hand/eye coordination and it's a nice sound not booming loud. I will be buying another one for a birthday party for a 2 year old that's in the next few weeks."
3,Average Book,"I consider this a very one dimensional book. Although it is written very clearly and is easy to understand, I do not feel it is very thorough. It is a great to book to learn about delta neutral trading, but it lacks information on other important option components such as gamma, theta, vega, and theoretical pricing. Natenberg's book is a far more complete and thorough text."
3,"It's a catchy title, huh?","The book gives a basic overview or perhaps a basic introduction to option hedging strategies. But there is really nothing new here; others have discussed these strategies before. You would also have to be an exceptional person to make ""high profits with low stress"" by just reading this book alone."
1,Not worth the money,"I have read the book and attended Mr. Fontanills $2500 seminar which was a complete waste of time (and money!).Most of the strategies are impractical (e.g Delta Netural which may be good for floor raders). During the seminar they push you to subsribe to their expensive newsletter which has been a cause for losing money to some of my friends! Do not buy the book, because it is a bait for other expensive products."
1,Don't quit your day job,"God help you if you think you can read this book (or any book)and learn how to make ""high profits"" with ""lowstress"". It fails the obvious test: If it's that easy, whydoesn't everyone do it? It's very tempting to believe that the pros have some secret formula, and that you could make lots of money if they'd just let you in on the secret. They don't, and you can't.If you really want to learn something about options, you can find the basics online. Then read a book with some substance, like Natenberg. Eventually, with years of trading experience and a lot of discipline, you might make some money. If that sounds like too much work, stick with index funds. But whatever you do, don't fall for the bogus, ""it worked for me"" testimonials on this page. You're not that stupid."
2,Disappointing,"This is definitely not a beginners book. The pages that pretend to teach the basics are far too uninformative. And why the focus on futures versus options? It left too much out of focus, unless you want to learn about Delta Neutral Trading and hedging."
4,The Options Course is worth the read,"I have looked for a book that teaches basic instruction, and that can be used as a reference in the future -- The Options Course fills the bill. I recommend this book if you are interested in trading Options, if you are already a trader that wants explainations of terms, or are already a trader and are interested in Fontanills' strategies. I read all the reviews and noticed many referencing online websites. Be careful with the motivations of these reviewers."
2,sticky mess,"The wax cartridge that came with the Clean n Easy applicator was great. No problems at all. For some reason these refills are inferior. When using the same fabric strip to remove multiple layers, the wax comes off the fabric and sticks to my leg. It takes repeated passes and more fabric strips than it should, but it eventually gets the job done."
1,Simple book,"The author writes about dogs' behaviour and emotions in a simplistic manner. Most dog owners would be able to relate to and understand their dogs without reading this book. The book also lacks emphasis on the interpretations of dogs' behaviour and emotions. Generally, the book lacks substance despite a good tittle."
1,Not for beginners and not for reference,"I rate this book poor. I guess that it is an overview of sorts, but not really, and as a reference book it's poorly laid out, lots of typos and not enough pictures to show what the text is referring to. This is not a book that I'll be buying again (for Dummies series). I suggest that you save your money."
5,"Step Reebok,The Video",I received this video as a complimentary gift when I bought a pair of Reebok shoes. I think it was about 8 years ago. I just recently broke the tape and am so disappointed. This is one of the best workout tapes I had. I lost 48 lbs in a year and attribute the loss mostly to this tape. It's easy to follow and keep up with. A great workout! I'm hoping this tape will go back on the market.
2,All biochemistry books are confusing,"Which is why its a 300 level class. you really need to read the chapter 2x to get the feel for things. Yes you can go to class but if you prefer to study at home, read carefully and fish out notes, read a couple more times to take notes and understand it. BTW its the same as the next edition so save yourself some money and just get this edition. How much can biochemistry really change?"
4,A must read for those with imagination,"I found this book quite compelling - however, the subjects though were not completely filled out in their complexities - many unanswered questions - and I would have preferred to have the story actually complete itself rather than end so abrubtly. I did enjoy the fantasy portions and the vivid descriptions of the poverty of the Jewish Section and the glory and splendor of the Harem. I would recommend this book highly - and hope that the author continues the story to include the life of Raven in a more precise and complete fashion in another book in the future. Kathleen"
2,Surf Frogs,"I had given this to my cousin, it was super at the time, but when his frogs died, he was devastated that they were gone.So maybe it would be a good science project for some one older that 8 years old."
1,Cool thought if you could ever get frogs!,"I have bought alot of educaional things like this for my son and have had alot of good experiences but this one is really awful! I had one tadpole for about 2 months and it died and the other one for 3 months and it died too.......we followed the directions to the T and they still died.......BIG WASTE OF MONEY, TIME AND A REAL DISAPOINTMENT TO MY SON!"
1,I should have stopped after reading one of her other books!,"What a poorly written mystery....loose ends, a detective that doesn't detect much, thin plot...don't waste your time!"
2,My dogs won't play with it,"Something about the Chompion they just don't like... they refuse to play with it. And they LOVE to chew toys, so I'm a bit puzzled. Oh, well."
2,V-com Requires Sofeware Updates Just to Get Antivirus Updates,"Version 6 offers no significant benefits over version 5, and V-com's decision to require Version 5 users to upgrade to Version 6 in order to continue receiving antivirus updates is a very poor decision. As a long time user of System Suite, it makes me angry that V-com requires me to upgrade rather than simply offering antivirus updates at a fair price on a stand alone basis. Don't buy it--move on to any of several other antivirus vendors that don't use this unreasonable sales tactic."
1,Very good but one flaw,"I really liked this alarm clock for about 1 week. Great features and nice size for the bedside table.However......One night I noticed that it was humming. And it wasn't a low volume hum, it was noticeable. So after a sleepless night (i found it hard to get to sleep with the hum) I returned it.I got a replacement model and it too had a hum.So sadly I got my money back and I am searching again for a new model."
1,Not the man he appears to be.,"Shelley Stewart is absolutely NOT the man he appears to be. As a member of his family, I have seen his astonishing greed and selfishness towards the family he supposedly cares so much about. He has poor relationships with his son, and most of his other children. He cares only for himself, and offers no help his family. Take it from me; buy another book. Large portions of this book were admitted to be largely fictional."
5,"Excellent, concise, practical, very useful for new CM's",As a new Case Manager I found this book to an excellent reference book. The information was concise and practical. A must fo Case Manager's who are starting out. Gives great descriptions of teminology and the differneces in all health care systems. The legal and ethical material provided offer much for the working case manager.
5,The Book of All Books aka The Definitive Cream-A History!,"If there was ever a book to get on the 1960's group CREAM, this is it! Very interesting; you won't put it down! Interesting backgrounds on all 3 of these legends. Must reading, no ifs, ands or buts! Buy it!"
2,This game was a dissapointment,I had planned on buying this game for some time as our family loves learning games and we had been learning a lot of geography. I found this game did not live up to my expectations at all. The questions were so easy to figure out that whoever went first was usually the winner. We have only played the game once and no one has reached for it since. It does have some cute features (such as cute card questions). My children are ages 6 and 8 and found it basically uninteresting.
3,"Better for younger children, but needs improvements","Great idea for a board game with lots of learning potential for younger children, however children 10+ years may soon find this formula a little unchallenging. Several improvements could make this a better product; notably, heavier paper for the frequently handled question cards, and a much larger map on the game board. Some of the countries appear too small for grandparents and children with poor eyesight. Also, the spinner is labeled with text that should be larger. With just a few design changes and the opportunity to purchase additional question card packs, perhaps geared towards different age groups, we could recommend this game more enthusiastically."
4,A GREAT BOOK TO READ!!,"I ABSOLUTELY LOVED THIS BOOK. I HAD READ THE PRINCESS DIARIES SERIES BOOKS PRIOR TO THIS ONE AND I LOVED THEM TOO. THIS BOOK IS THE BEST SO FAR. IT WAS VERY EXCITING TO READ. I COULDN'T PUT IT DOWN BECAUSE I WAS ALWAYS CURIOUS TO LEARN WHAT HAPPENS NEXT. I WAS VERY HAPPY TO BE INTRODUCED TO THIS SERIES OF BOOKS BECAUSE I WOULD OF NEVER READ PRINCESS IN LOVE. I RECOMMEND THIS BOOK TO ANY TEENAGE GIRL BECAUSE MIA IS A NORMAL GIRL JUST LIKE ANY TEENAGER. SHE STRUGGLES AT SCHOOL, HOME, WITH HER FRIENDS, AND WITH HER LOVE LIFE. I GUARANTEE THAT YOU WILL SOMEHOW RELATE TO MIA."
4,A good edition to the series,"Princess In Love, the 3rd book of the great series The Princess Diaries, was great. If your looking for a light read, you've come to the right place!Mia Thermopolis is back again, and now with a whole NEW set of problems. She finally has a boyfriend, Kenny, but he isn't exactly what she wanted. She finds herself pining away after Michael, her best friend Lily's brother. Will Michael and Mia ever find love, and will Mia ever cope with being a princess? Find out in Princess In Love.I liked this book the best out of the 3 because it tied up a lot of loose ends and it had the happy ending I was going for. :) I'm anxious to see what happens in the 4th book, Princess In Waiting. If you want a quick read that will make you laugh, then this is the book for you."
5,A Must-Read Title,"This book is one of the most well-written novels I have read in a long time. Mia Thermopolis is a character that you will never forget! It is helpful to read the first 2 books before reading this volume, though. I definetly recommend this book to anyone looking for a pretty easy, entertaining story. It's almost like reading notes from your pal at school.The ending is the best part of this particular volume, so you have to read it!!!"
3,Princess Diary Part II,"Book is geared toward a 12 and older audience. Definetly rated PG. Good book, just not age appropriate for under 12."
3,just a plain three -_-,I didn't quite like the ending and the story of the third volume. Tina turned out to be more of a bestfriend of Mia and Lilly turned out to be more freaky. The ending didn't end well because it just leaved you hanging on a cliff but I like the way how Michael proposed to Mia.
2,Princess in Love: Mia's New Prediciament,"Once again, Mia's life is O-V-E-R. What now, you ask? Oh, she has a boyfriend. Yes, that is her big huge problem. Well, the problem is that she doesn't like her boyfriend. She LOVES Michael Moscovitz, however. Will her anonomous love letters work? This book has a cliched plot and is not very well written anyway. I thought that the narrator was really whining about her ridiculously petty problems and should just be thankful for the fact that she has a good life. Then again, this book is sure to make anyone with some REAL problems feel much better about themselves."
3,Not as good as the other two,"I absolutely LOVED the first two books in The Princess Diaries series, but I was disappointed with the ending of the third book. However, I won't spoil the ending for those who have not yet read it. It seemed unrealistic, even more so than the basic outline of the series. Sure, most people don't discover that they are the heir to a small country and that their mom is sleeping with their math teacher, but the twist at the end of this book surpassed all of them. I really liked this series, and I do hope that it is not the end of The Princess Diaries."
4,Mia Mia,"This book was well done but perhaps a bit monationious. These books are very funny and enlighting. This book is a contuination from the last two and she finally gets the man of her dreams, which also happens to be her best friends brother. The book is funny charming and downright zaney. If your looking for a good hearted good read read this, you'll laugh the whole way through."
3,Don't use without checking the online errata!!,"Good idea, poor accuracy - the online errata page could fill a small chapter!! For a book which condenses (complex?) 'tekki' info like J2EE into a readable, understandable, and USEABLE 'guru' reference, accuracy REALLY counts!! Without updating your copy from the online errata, you could easily 'be pulling your hair out' for quite a while by following the instructions found in here. Also, I was surprised at their comments regarding the recent migration of their website from J2EE to .NET. One of their listed reasons was ""...and the drag-and-drop method of web development.(for .NET)"". Wow!! For people who sell 'technical guru how-to' books, this sounds a bit like taking advanced painting lessons from teachers who 'paint by numbers'!! Call me 'antiquated', but I think that their website should reflect the technical competence that they purport to publish."
2,Blue Giggler Ball,"The only time it 'giggles' is when it bounces and hits the floor in a particular position or you manually shake it. You have to hold the ball in a particular position when u shake or it won't giggle. Also, in my opinion, this is not a giggle. It's a weird annoying noise."
2,Too loud!,"Even at the low volume setting and standing across the room, this toy is too loud. Since a child plays with this toy near her ears, will her still-developing hearing faculties be permanently damaged by it?"
2,Looks Great to Me - But She Could Care Less...,"My 14 month old daughter received this as a gift when she was about 6 months. It interested her for about 2 minutes I think. I thought maybe she was too young to really appreciate it, but 8 months later, she still could care less. I can't explain it - I think it's a cute toy, and it works very well and easily. But unfortunately, it's one of those toys that usually works its way to the bottom of her toy box until I fish it out and then it gets looked at for 30 seconds and it's in the box again. She's a very active 1 year old, so maybe this toy just isn't stimulating enough for her. If you have a baby that sits and plays with one toy for any period of time, they may like it. But my guess is there are other's more interesting."
5,"Good product, very fast delivery","The Alphasmart Dana was a bit of a marvel in 2003 and for a few years thereafter but now, unless you're a lover of Palm software, I wouldn't buy it unless you love gadgets. If you intend to use it for writing, as I do, the Alphasmart Neo is a far better choice and a really great product. I recommend it unreservedly, having used it most productively for the past 7 1/2 years to write books (a chapter at a time which is then placed in a computer). It's not good for editing, but as a portable writing tool with a wonderful keyboard and battery life, it can't be surpassed. Buy it!I doubt that I'll use the Dana much, which isn't the seller's fault since the one I got looks nearly new. If Alphasmart, which is a very good company, upgraded the Dana's operating system and wifi capacity I would buy one for $300 or so. But the Dana has now been discontinued, so..."
1,Almost worthless,"Got this for Christmas, I would have returned this but I dont want to disapoint the wife..The remote is timer only, there are other units that are available that show the temp WHICH IS WAHT YOU NEED... They claim the range is 100ft... I cant get any more than 10ft with new batteries and the thing raised over my head. I love the concept and plan on breaking this one so I can buy a better one :)"
2,Beast wars transformers,"People, people, people. This game is not at all what i expected. I first saw this game at a mall but didn't have enough money to buy it. I got the money and Bought it here.WARNING it is a fighting game , not a strategy. You can only be 8 wimpy characters that have only 2 special attacks that are easy to dodge. The voices are o.k. but they only say 2 lines.The battle grounds suck and the graphics are horrible. You can only use Optimus, Cheetor , Rat trap, Silverbolt for the Maximals and For the Predecons you can only use Megatron, Tarantulas, quick strike and Rampage. TThis game is easy to beat as i am not a pro gamer but i beat it on hard in less than 10 minutes."
3,Frustrating,"This was a very easy read, nothing really exciting. It was a rather trite Christian fiction story. It also is the type of plot that makes you mad throughout - the entire town and their families believe something untrue that seems to never end (that Brooke and Nick had an affair when Brooke was in high school). It is very annoying and makes for a frustrating read."
2,Very disappointing,"The Publishers Weekly Review was exactly right on. Terri Blackstock is one of my favorite authors, but this book was completely unrealistic and therefore not enjoyable. And did anyone else notice that the characters ""whispered"" everything?! I would recommend Blackstock's other books, but definitely not this one."
2,First class is an understatement here. This would be $$$$.,"While the color was much better than the Rocky Mountain Pass trip DVD, the train is different. They so highly taught it as a First Class Luxury trip, I think you'd have to be in the wealthy class to even afford to go on this trip. The scenery is not as good as the Rocky Mountain Pass trip from Vancouver to Banff, I'd take that one first. It looks a lot more fun, while this one shows 5 star luxury, it's not my style of fun. The DVD itself is fairly colorful, but so intent on showing how high class the trip is, I think it turns more people off to the trip, than on. I'd recommend seeing the DVD however, so you do not make the mistake of taking this particular trip. Take a better trip, you'll have more fun."
2,Slightly Disappointed!,"I can't say we didn't enjoy seeing this video, but we will not bother viewing it a second time. We were hoping for more scenery, and far less commercialism. Rose and John"
1,Pedophile behind the Degree!,"Dr. Gary Almy charged with child molestation. I personally worked with this man. I saw his questionable actions with boys in his care, and unethical admistering of drugs. Hopefully through proper counsling and support, more boys will have the strength to come forward in the future against Dr. Almy. He deserves more than 7yrs, because the boys he molested with have to live with it the rest of their lives."
2,Worst button layout I have ever found/,"The buttons on this are the most unintuitive things I think I have ever seen. Some functions are hard to do even with the instructions. DON'T LOSE YOUR INSTRUCTIONS!! I did, and I can't figure out how to set the day of week. Terrible, terrible interface. Can't imagine the stupidity of the people who designed this. I'm going to replace mine with something else.No big loss, since the sound is pretty poor, too. Of course, most clock radios have lousy sound, and this is no exception."
2,"Poorly written, badly organised, repetitive","This book is very badly written. It is full of gobbledegook; for example: ""The corporate portal solution is deployed in several iterations or design phases in order to revaluate universal or global features as the portal application incorporates functionality in the higher levels of personalization and navigation."" The book contains a great deal of needless repetition. The English is dense; you have to constantly figure out what the author is trying to say. The paragraphs jump abruptly from one theme to another. Fortunately I work for a company producing one of the major portals. Our online help gives me a succinct answer to the use of portals. If you want a pleasant read on portals, look elsewhere."
2,Not much here,"I've read a lot of technical books across a number of computer-related topics, and usually I find something useful. Unfortunately I agree with some of the other reviewers that the book was repetitious and too superficial to be of much use. The writing style was very dry and unengaging. The checklists are a nice idea, but not executed very well. I'd look further for a good primer on this subject....."
2,"""firewalls"" misleading ... content is general internet security","The title ""Firewalls for dummies"" is misleading. No, it does not talk to the layperson, or even someone trying to setup a home firewall. Rather, it targets manager-types at companies that have basic tcp/ip experience. The first 150 pages or so doesn't even have any solid examples of allow/deny rules. There is another book called ""internet security for dummies"". This should have probably been that book, because the depth it goes into general security issues like antivirus, file attachements, mail security is much more general than firewalls. Plus I think I see a few errors in the book and am unable to locate an errata for it online. I wrote to the FirewallsForDummies[at]hotmail.com address thats mentioned in the book to ask the authors for errata info, and it bounced back as mailbox not available."
5,Getting & GuitarStyles,"If you are a serious musician you should get this book it teaches you different style of music,it comes with a cd and tab ,I don't think this book is for beginners you should be at least an intermiate guitar player.Great book."
3,Beanie Baby Bronty,"Bronty is great, although when I ordered it I thought I was getting the ""regular"" size beanie baby, not the large one, so it was a bit disappointing. My son is happy with it, but I think he would have been happier with the smaller, regular size more."
5,"No longer ""Dumb""","I bought a wireless access point, and it really did not cover my house, so I bought another, but they did not work together at all, and neither manufacturer could tell me anything. I really needed to figure it out for myself. I also wanted to get higher speeds, and make sure my neighbors could not snoop on my connection, but wanted my friends to be able to come over and surf with me if needed. I also wanted to be able to use my wireless when on the road. Wireless Home Networking for Dummies told me how to do all of this, and why. Call me juvenile or silly, but I simply find it easier to read a book that's funny and smart at the same time. I had read these guys' Smart Homes book, and it was just as good, so I had no problem deciding which book to buy. You can take a chance on others, or you can buy this one and be happy. I wrote this wirelessly, so you know where I stand!"
4,Adequate air cleaner,The Delta ambient air cleaner provides adequate air cleaning if used near your work while sanding etc.I set mine up over my sanding /glue up bench.
4,"Large enough for a 17"" laptop","This briefcase is large enough for my 17"" laptop and several files. It is easy to connect and disconnect from the wheels. The handle isn't as sturdy as I'd like (wiggles a bit but not so much that I think it will break). The leather isn't as rich looking as it appears in the photograph which was disappointing."
3,"Past is not prologue, alas.","I grew up with the original edition of this book, and so was deligted when I saw that it had been re-issued. However, I was dissapointed with the new version. As I see it, there are several problems. The first relates to Leonard Marcus' new introduction--which ironically seems perjorative in places towards Untermeyers' original efforts. Secondly, the editors have removed several poems in the interests of political correctness. Lastly, the slick paper coupled with the darker printing has compromised the Joan Augland art. I will give this to my daughter, and keep looking on ebay for the original."
5,Make this a gift to every new parent!,"This book originally came out back in the 1950's and my mother used to read it to me every night since I was an infant (that was nearly four decades ago). This is the book that got me to love reading. I recently bought a number of copies for friends and family who just had children and there is only one minor change from the older editions: five poems were removed because today they would be considered quite racist. But the tone of the book and the illustrations are superb! Untermeyer (editor) did a wonderful job of collecting funny, witty, deep, and profoundly moving series of poems that will appeal to anyone. Among my favorites are: ""The Owl and the Pussycat"", ""Winken, Blinken, and Nod"", ""Father William"", and ""Little George.""This book is a must for children. I cannot say enough about it. Just buy it and keep a few extra copies on hand to give away. You will not regret it!"
5,soooo cool,"im only 13 and i dont read lots of book but this one caught my eye so i read it and could'nt put it down.it got so exciting, this book is something i can relate to from all the kids in my school. stand straight and grow tall is the best, book every one should read it this summer."
3,Wrong Housing,"When I ordered this item I entered my TV model and the web site recommended a bulb style. The bulb arrived very quickly, so great shipping, but as the title suggests with the wrong housing. A few screws later I switched out the bulbs and with the new bulb inside of the old housing my TV is up and running again. Overall a satisfactory purchase but the web site needs to do a better job at matching the bulbs and especially the housings to the TV models."
1,Worst bulb replacement,"I received this bulb early. I installed it on feb 14th on feb15th it blew out. This the worst bulb make sure you don't buy your bulbs from a matter of fax. Their products are terrible. I've bought replacement bulbs before and it lasted five years, but it was the Phillips brand. I guess the old saying is true you get what you pay for. When you buy generic you get a low quality product when you buy name brand you get a top quality product."
1,"Not a Sony product even tho it is advertised as such, and it doesn't work!","I guess you get what you pay for. This replacement bulb does not work, am returning it to Amazon. I am surprised that they allow the bulb to be marketed as ""by Sony"", and it is not by Sony. It was based on that solely that I purchased this bulb thinking that it would be as advertised. I have bought one before from Amazon and it was the real thing. Apparently this knockoff's housing is not the same so it does not connect to the sensor. Not good!"
1,Comunications with Margin Mart,"I ordered a Sony projection lamp XL2100U from Margin Mart. The wrong lamp was sent and they had me ship it back, and they would send the correct one. I did this and asked them to reimburse me for the $9.85 it cost to send the incorrect lamp back. I have never heard from them since. The replacement came and there is no indication that it is a Sony lamp. The label on the box says made in China. After several tries to get them to pay the $9.85 they owe me, I filed a claim with Amazon. They were good enough to give me a $10 credit on my next Amazon purchase. I think Amazon should have outside sellers follow the same high standards that Amazon does. My experience with Amazon and other outside suppliers has been very good. This is the first bad one."
1,Cheap Fail Lamp,This lamp is cheap and failed after only two months use. The original Sony lamp lasted five years. Do NOT buy this lamp.
3,Only Option,"This was not a Manufacturer (Sony) OEM Lamp, The last replacement Lamp that I purchased was a knock-off as well, not the same brand as this one, but it only lasted about 1 year, the original Sony Bulb lasted about 6 years. I do not what the longevity of this particular brand will be; the product did fit, did solve the immediate problem of no picture, and as the TV is going on 10 years old, the manufacturer, Sony, is not selling or manufacturing parts for it. If one could find and opt for an OEM Bulb from Sony, I would imagine that it would last longer?"
1,doesn't last,"We installed this bulb in our TV less than 2 months ago and it has already burned out. Not a Sony product even though it is listed as ""Sony replacement lamp"" Very misleading and definately not worth the price."
1,Poor hard drive,"I'm sorry to disagree with this reviewer who uses it with Powermac. I'm not sure how he uses the computer but I do A LOT of video editing on my PowerMac and it turned to be a one piece of crap HD. Initially I was hopping for great performance and it did while you do something simple. But the sustained transfer speed is very very very BAD. My old Seagate 80Gb drive did way better, was much quieter, not to mention it bears 5 years warranty versus 1 year for Maxtors. It can't handle 3 video tracks read simultaneously. I always regarded Maxtors as average drive manufacturer and had been mislead by it 16Mb buffer. Never ever I'll buy drive from them. Seagate is another league manufacturer."
2,No SATA Power Cable / Converter,"I agree with Gadget Guy when he says that Maxtor should supply the buyer with an internal SATA power cable along with the SATA Interface cable since this power connector IS NOT STANDARD AT ALL, therefore, I will give Maxtor 3 stars for this big mistake.Also, 1 star for J & R and AMAZON.COM for not MAKING CLEAR in the drive specs that THIS DRIVE WORKS WITH A SATA POWER CABLE AND NOT THE STANDARD 4-PIN LEGACY POWER CABLE.So beware people, this drive doesn't work with the standard power supply connector but a SATA one so you must buy a converter before purchasing this drive.Overall, 2 stars. I'll make a new review when i can make the drive work. Right now, i am pissed off because i was looking forward to replace my current drive and reinstall Windows XP thsi weekend but now i will have to wait until i have the converter.Best Regards,- Paul"
5,It works!!!,"I've suffered with horrible acne, made worse this past year. I've done antibiotics--which worked until I went off them..go figure. I had various brands of organic skins care lines such as burt's bees, but none of them took care of my acne. I found out about lerosett while searching online for yet another ""acne cure"". I've been using lerosett clay for about 6 weeks--probably week seven now. From the first use, it started to purge my skin, not going to lie the first week of use was hard because my skin got worse. But since it was already so bad, figured I had nothing left to lose. After two weeks I noticed a significant improvement. Every week has gotten better. I only have a few bumps left on one cheek and forehead. If you are like me and so tired of trying product after product for two weeks and not getting better, please try this before you give up!"
5,Why spend hundreds of dollars?,"This simple Moka easily creates Espressos in less than 10 minutes that are hot and tasty. Instead of spending $200+ dollars on an Espresso machine, I purchased this and was not disappointed. On those hard-to-get-going mornings, this little kettle is my savior."
1,Zero Stars! This coffee maker has 3 major defects!,"This coffee maker has 3 major defects:1-It produces bitter American coffee2-It never makes Espresso as promised3-Very tiny 6 cups, which are in reality it fills less than one small home coffe mugDo not buy it, I returned it."
2,just a typical aluminum one you can get for much cheaper elsewhere,"got it in today, only reason i bought it because i saw the picture it has sprout on top with little holes but mine came in just typical pipe and a blocker on top to prevent it squirt straight up... disappointed already... because i saw the same material bigger size and same design for only 14.99 at the asian market near by... this one with the stamp made in italy and sold for $7 more expensive.... jeezand 6 cups= 6 oz = 180ml .... there is your 6 cups... so misleading .... i think this piece is over price .. for now 3 star until i use it and may update my review"
3,There is no fill line on my unit.,"Thanks to my previous experience with this product line I successfully prepared my espresso. I am pleased with this product even though the fill to line is missing, an inconvenience but nothing more."
4,Great Strong Coffee Maker,"First pot I bought, the seal leaked. I guess these have issues with the seals. I returned it and bought a second one and it's fine now. Read the review by T.Speidel and it is spot on. First couple of cups I got from it were metallic tasting. Now around the 5 cup, the coffee tastes great. Still not sure if I prefer this over my Espresso machine yet, but it doesn't give good coffee and is a lot easier to use than an Espresso maker.My brother bought back from France a little spout cover so the coffee doesn't shoot over the edge when the lid is open. I just need to find the perfect ground for it and the right amount of grams of coffee to put in for that perfect cup."
4,Makes the best Coffee!,"I used 2 scoops of fresh ground Starbucks Italian roast. I loved the taste, but...I didn't believe I couldn't put it in the dishwasher. What a mistake! After one trip to the dishwasher it lost the finish...ended up just raw aluminum.The only other thing, I wish it would make more than one large cup of coffee.It's made in Italy.I am buying another one, maybe the next size up."
4,"Good Strong Coffee, But Exagerated Size","This little item functions well and is interesting to look at. It works quickly...usually within 4-5 minutes. It has a nice style, but the advertised size is not accurate. The 6 ""cup"" version that I am using actually makes about 20 oz max...slightly less than 3 ""cups"". The catch is found in the word ""cup"" which is used in the advertised size to mean ""servings"" since a serving of actual espresso is only a couple of ounces. As long as you don't expect 48 oz (6 measuring cups) you should be pleased with this product."
1,Made of Aluminum,"This is made of aluminum, which is known to have possible health hazard when used as cooking application. I bought it because I through it was made of stainless steel (Never thought of someone still selling aluminum cooking products.)"
5,Excellent,"I love this thing, was going out for coffee daily but use this every morning nowJust make sure to rinse it and leave it dry or mold will grow and you will have to toss itI use mine every morning, then the next morning I will rinse it and use it again. This way I can leave it and only rinse it before I need to use it but if you plan to go more than a day without using it make sure to leave it dry"
5,Money well spent,I have been using the Bialetti product for many years and I must say that this product continuous to be the one to buy. The product quality is second to none.
1,Maybe size matters...,"I purchased the 6-cup ""espresso maker."" The bottom chamber consistently filled with coffee as well grounds. Discolored quickly ... aluminum is highly reactive to almost everything... Read another review with recommendation the 1-3 cup stovetop espresso maker performs better and I will give it a try. Returned the 6800 Moka Expresss. Need morning coffee so currently using a little Indian pot, stainless steel, and other than the required 15-minute wait for the filtered coffee... it is interesting coffee... It is tasty..."
3,Works but not perfect,It makes a fairly good cup of coffee in about 4 minutes. But not 6 cups and not even 2 cups. Because you have to use fairly coarse grounds the coffee is not espresso strength so you can only dilute it so much. If you use finer grounds you will get more sediment in your coffee as there is no paper filter. Even with a very coarse grounds you get a fair amount of sediment both in the percolator and in your cup.
3,Good but small,Excellent results but 6 cup size only produces 11 oz at most (one mug). The diameter ( 4 inches ) is too small to cover the flame on a gas cooktop unless turned down to minimum.
2,Almost too short.,"I bought this CD in hopes of listening to it several times; picking up new things here and there, but really, it is just as the title says ""beginner's guide."" Guess I was expecting a little bit more... I listened to it twice, then moved on. If you are totally 100% new to Buddhism, then this in an okay introduction; though perhaps you money would be better spent on The Complete Idiot's Guide to Zen Living or Buddhism for Dummies."
3,Not his best work,This album could have been much better coming form a great r&b singer like el debarge.I've been a big fan of el debarge since i was a kid so when this album came out i was really excepting his best since it was his first solo project breaking out from his family group debarge.He had a couple of good songs like who's johnny and the ballad when love has gone away other than that this album was really bland.But if your a debarge fan like i am you should check it out and hear for yourself and you be the judge of it.
1,Are you ready to be called crazy?,"The author tells that God may talk with you - and a joke comes to mind:If you talk to God it is called prayer and is found to be OK, even admirable at times.If you tell God talks to you, you may be called insane and put in a funny farm.At least to some there is that danger. So watch your steps.The guru too was called crazy at times. That is no secret. As Yogananda himself said, ""We are all a little bit crazy and we don't know it."""
3,Hokey,"Looked into purchasing, saw a floor model at a local dealer. Very cheap and flimsy looking. Save your Money.This saw is typical of the current downturn in quality if Delta products we have witnessed lately."
2,Not so amusing,"There are some books which are more fun for parents than kids, and this might be one of them. I found this retelling of the tale to be creative, yet oddly uncompelling. If your kids already know the story of the princess and the pea, then this postmodern tale might be amusing. I'm not a big fan of the traditional princess-marries-the-prince fairy tale, but this one didn't cut it for me or my kids. Since some reviewers seem to love it, I suggest you check it out of the library first to see what you think."
3,watch for a teenager,The watch is cute but the band is very slim and short. It looks oddly out of place on an adult woman. I am not satisfied with it at all.
3,Kind of small,We got this for a Christmas exchange gift I thought it was a good size. You are paying for the name. I would drop this in my purse or in glove box. I do have an off brand knife in my car but it is getting rust spots. I'm guessing the Swiss Army name would not rust. I would of been happy receiving this gift. I would of gave it a 4 star.
5,Amazing tool,"This little multi tool is absolutely the perfect combination of useful tools for everyday use. I used to carry a Victorinox Super Tinker but I stopped carrying it because of the size this little guy has all the useful tools of the bigger swiss army knives without the bulk, there are a couple of features that the bigger swiss army knives have such as the can opener,reamer which I absolutely never use, and what I like about the manager is the fact that the tools have been smartly incorporated into a tiny package such as the the Philips screwdriver, bottle opener, wire stripper all in one piece of metal. The Philips screwdriver amazingly works on just about any screw I have tried it on #0,#1,#2 etc. actually it even worked on a #00 Philips screw. I actually prefer the Philips screwdriver of this compared to the mid positioned screw driver on the bigger knives it is just much better to have it in-line and end mounted. You don't realize how useful it is until you buy one."
1,Mostly Worthless,Most of the examples and/or instructions do not work correctly when applied to an actual database.
5,The Sound Person Winces,"I was baby sitting one time when one of the kids showed me this series. The true mark of a great story is that you keep coming back to it, re-reading many times even when you know the ending. Susan Cooper command of the depths of Celtic-British symbolism and mythology is awesome. These are great books. Alex Jennings has done a fine job as reader.So the cassette tapes ain't the best quality. So the cassette tapes aren't even medium quality. So there's audible tape hiss even with Dolby B.I believe there is an audio medium called the Cee Dee, and if there is any book or series that demands its own merits be reflected in the production, ""The Dark Is Rising"" would be up at the top of the list.Order your copy so's you make sure you ask for the CD's."
5,What a Book!,"I'm going to echo the words of so many other reviewers here, it doesn't matter how old one is, this is an excellent book. I first read it at 13 or 14..now so many years later I still feel the wonder that I did back then.One of the best good vs. evil books ever written. Highly recommended for everyone."
5,OMG!,"Will stanton thought he was an ordinary eleven year old …he was wrong. On his birthday he is tossed""into a tidle wave of events. Will is not only the seventh son of a seventh son but an old one mysteryous imortal people of ""the light"" the last one to be born in fact! If your not a reader …… there is a moive too or if you like the book and want to see it come to life! get the greenwhitch and (if you havent read it yet) Over Sea, Under Stone at the kindle store!!!!!"
5,Fine,Works great and very light weight. Not like the old heavy bundt pans. It makes just the right sized cake.
4,Just the right size cake,"This 6-cup bundt pan makes just the right size cake if you don't want a big cake. It uses the same amount of batter as for a single layer 9"" round cake pan.So far, I've used it successfully for a strawberry cake, and to halve the recipe for the Banana Butterscotch Chip Cake with Brown Sugar Frosting at [...], making a brown sugar glaze rather than frosting for the cake. (Use half the powdered sugar.)Altogether I'me very pleased with this product, except I wish there were more of a lip to hold onto when turning out the cake."
2,"loved it, but hate it now","I absolutely loved this pan when I first got it. My husband and I can't eat a whole bundt cake so this was the perfect size for us. I make 2 of them and give the other to a neighbor or a friend for their birthday.I have used it about 6 times, always hand washing after use. Tonight whe I went to wash it, the non stick surface is peeeling off! I have to say I am very disappointed because now I will have to go and buy the expensive ones with no non stick coating that will peel off.I would not recommend this product unless you only want to use it a few times!"
2,I'm so bummed out now,"I used the pan a couple of times and the cake came out beautifully. Today was the third time I used it and the cake got completely stuck....I'm still scratching my head over it because I sprayed the pan generously with oil spray before pouring the batter in (and I hand wash all my pots and pans). I don't want to take anymore chances with this pan, it will be replaced for sure."
2,SHRED YOUR BACK WITH WEIGHTS,"I'm a huge fan of Jillian.But I think this my least favorite DVD that she's come out with.Workout 1: I liked this one. Super sore hammys, groin, and quads.Workout 2: WATCH OUT!!! This, I think, is a very dangerous workout. With all of the dives, swift bending of the back, quick swinging, puts a HUGE amount of stress and pressure on your back. And if you are somebody who does not have good form to start out with, you could be at risk for seriously injuring your lower back. Now I come from 20 years of ballet training, and posture and form is no issue for me. BUT. My back was absolutely KILLING ME the day after work out 2. I felt like a 89 year old granny in a 25 year old body.BE CAREFUL, as with any work out and intro to exercise. Do not push yourself to do what you are not ready to do.I would recommend her other DVDs over this one: ANY DAY."
3,Other JM videos are better,"I love JM and how hard core her workouts are. I was excited to get this new video since I do one of her videos most days of the week. However, I didn't realize this was a kettlebell workout. She says you can use a regular dumbbell, but it wasn't challenging at all, even with an 8 lb weight. I went online to see about buying the kettlebell, only to see how expensive it is. I don't want to invest that much money for a piece of equipment I would use with one 30 minute video. She also doesn't give enought instruction about the size of the weight you should use and since kettlebells are fairly new and different from weights, I think that would be hard to judge for yourself."
5,GREAT MOTIVATION,The exercises are easy enough to do but they kick your ASS... ! It will get me to my goel no dought..!
5,Feel the burn!,"This DVD is Ah-amazing!!!! I felt the burn in my arms, core area and legs instantly! I work out at a gym around 3/4 times a week and I do this workout DVD in the mornings! It was a great buy!"
4,Good workout but reminiscent of 30 Day Shred,"I love Jillian's DVD work outs. I use them for my strength training mostly. I don't own a kettle ball so I did this workout at home with a 5lb hand weight. One of the girls in the video performs all moves with a hand weight so it's nice to be able to see how she is doing the moves versus Jillian with the kettle ball.The actual workout itself (warm-up and cool down not included) is only about 20 minutes. At one point Jillian mentions a 25 minute workout but it's really only 20.I've only done level 1 which is a warm-up, three circuits with the weight/kettle ball and a cool down.I like the moves but after doing No More Trouble Zones I wished the workout was just a tad longer.Some moves in level 1 are hard! There is a jumping squat for instance which you can do with or without the weight. Even without the weight I was struggling!Overall, it's a nice quick way to get some strength in but I think it should have at least been 35 minutes of actual circuits."
2,Not Her Finest,"This was actually my very first JM DVD, purchased by accident while trying to buy the 30 day shred. 4 months later I have a sizeable Jillian library, and this one is collecting dust.The beginner level workout never really did much other than make me a little short of breath. I also had zero kettleball experience, so I felt like I was spending wayyy too much time worrying about my form/etc rather than concentrating on getting the most out of the moves. I felt like some of the exercises were almost impossible unless you had her specific kettleball."
2,Better Experience If I Had Kettlebells?,"I really enjoyed Jillian Michaels 30 Day Shred and so I wanted to try some of her other workouts. If you're not already familiar with how to substitute dumbbells for kettlebells then you're definitely more prone to injury with this workout. My arms got a bit of a workout with this DVD but the backs of my knees got more of one. Perhaps if I actually had kettlebells maybe this workout would have been a better experience so keep that in mind. In addition to Shred It with Weights, I also tried 6 Week Six Pack. However, the only workout from Jillian Michaels that I will keep in my rotation isJillian Michaels - 30 Day Shred. It's the best one of the bunch for sure!"
5,Not a disappointment,"After having read some of the reviews, I thought I might be disappointed. But not at all. I believe this is one of the best dvd:s Jillian Michaels has made. And I agree with others, there is no need to buy an adjustable kettlebell, but it is definitely a must to use kettlebells and not dumbells! It makes it so much more fun!"
4,Good workout,"I purchased Jillian's Shred it with weights one month ago. I use this DVD as a supplementary tool to include in my normal workout regimen, which consists of lifting heavy weights. I really enjoyed this workout DVD because it combines weights and cardio. The only problem I had with this DVD is the fact that there are several workouts that include Jumping, which is problematic because I live on the 4th floor of an apartment building (I don't like to disturb my neighbors). Other than that this DVD is a surefire way to see results."
3,"Great workout, very challenging. But....","It's a great and challenging workout and Jillian totally rocks. My only problem with it is that it hurts my knees. Many other people have stated that most of Jillian's videos are bad for your knees, but I wanted to try anyway. I'm pretty physically fit and strong, but it still kills my knees."
1,Well...,"I haven't seen it or anything, but I can tell by the way the last movie was made it will be a terrible dissapointment...just bits and pieces of the episodes cut and pasted together and sold as a movie. The acting is fake, the riding is less than mediocre, and it deviates so far from the plot line of the books you can only tell that is is actually the Saddle Club by the names and the title. The only half-way worth-while part I suppose would be the special features, done by girls that actually KNOW horses."
5,Absolutely wonderful,I've played Djembe for over a decade and was searching for introductory material for a friend who is just discovering drumming; and had a birthday coming up. The book and CD are excellent . . . They Love it!! . . . and is a very satisfactory guide into the world of rhythm.
2,beats by the ear,"I can't give this a fair assesment right now i haven't had the time to really sit down in read this or even look at it right now ,maybe in the near future i will have the opportunity to review it Thank You."
1,There should be a Zero stars option,"This video is theologically flawed from a Christian point of view. If you are wanting to buy something to enrich your faith try ""Man of Pain: The Holy shroud,"" ""Getting to Know the Shroud,"" or ""Unlocking the secrets of the shroud"""
2,The Mysterious Man of the Shroud,This was not a true documentary. I have seen other videos that tell more of the recent scientific facts that were not discussed in this video. Too much opinion and opinion-theory and not enough evidence to prove that the theory had any merit.
3,The book is about statistics...,"I agree with Bruce Hadley, who introduces the book saying ""Packed with facts, figures, and references - keep it...ready for your next offshore debate.""... The book tries to pack in as much of governmental and other statistics it can into the few pages it has....On the flip side, the statistics quoted are also a point-in-time snapshot so even quoting those six-months or a year form now will be moot.- Mohan(...)"
4,Not Exactly as Shown...,"The nuts with this kit are all plastic, not as shown in the picture. This is not necessarily bad, in fact... I prefer it that way."
1,Terrible - Strips with little effort,"These screws are worthless. The second they hit the smallest bit of tension, they begin to strip. Just go to the hardware store and pick up some fasteners."
1,The only metal was the staples on the packaging,"Completely worthless junk. The bolts are plastic, the nuts are plastic. Excuse me... ""nylon"".I wouldn't trust these bolts to hold anything. They're purely cosmetic and definitely not worth anything close to a buck each."
4,"Exciting, imaginative music from a real player.","This record is a great piece of work from a man who always plays on a high level. If you don't know George Coleman, you should. He's played on some of the seminal jazz albums. Here he is doing the music of Rodgers, and the result is adventurous and classic."
1,Crosswind--take me away!,"I recently read ""Crosswind"", and I found it--well, I found it longwinded and pretentious. Ms. Valdata's overly embellished style brought tears to my eyes--tears of joy when I finished plowing through this monstrosity. The unending melodrama of college student Ellen Horvath's life, complete with soap opera like twists and turns, left me aching for more--more substance, more reality, more true literature. Read this book if you dare--but be prepared for every literary device any professor ever taught you in creative writing 101."
3,it works fine,"Sure its hot on the outside, but so is a regular oven. That's just the ""nature of the beast"".We purchased this one from Target on sale. You can make regular sized pizza in it (why we're sold on it).I don't like the plastic front. It should be glass.The controls aren't designed very well, kinda cheap. I manually wound down the timer dial & now sometimes the timer will just stop when it has 5-10 minutes left.I don't need all the features I don't use grill, it doesn't really do anything. & I don't use the toast feature. Toasting bread & stuff on the stove-top griddle works easier."
4,You get what you paid for,"For a cheap toaster oven I find this one does the trick (I paid $25 at Bed Bath and Beyond with coupon). It broils more evenly and better than any other cheap toaster oven I've had. The power indicator is spelled correctly on mine and I never had an issue with any smoke. It completely satisfies all my toaster oven needs.However, the outside does heat up substantially, the toasting is not even (one side more than the other) and finally the timer, which clicks, stops at about 3 minutes and turns off without chiming or completing the set time.For the price you just need to decide if you are willing to put up with those inconviences."
3,Evaluated a lot of Miter Saws,"I bought this saw to do precise molding work. The saw has the capacity that Delta states, but, here are the negatives:The miter table was not flush with the base. This creates a problem when making precise cuts. I mentioned this to Delta and they felt that the saw was in tolerance. So I went to Lowe's and put a square on all of the miter saws displayed, about 4 Deltas, 3 Hitachis 4 Dewalts and 1 Makita. All of the Delta miter saws resulted in their miter tables not being flush with their bases. All the other machines were machined near perfect. My two other complaints are simple. The (what I call, for a lack of a better term) ""tear drop"" bevel pointer was very difficult to read when positioning the bevel to other degrees than 0, 5, 10, 20, etc. Lastly, the saw is quite heavy. To some, this may not be a problem, however, for on site work, it may become an issue."
2,Not what the jacket and buying info says,"Amazon offers many books that are much better on the loss of a deeply loved pet. While the art and writing are good, the way the story evolves did little to cushion the grief of three generations of our family saying good-bye to a very special dog. Ideas about afterlife were intoduced that brought confusion rather than hope to our family coping with the death of a pet that has been part of our life for many years. After one reading of this book by everyone, it became a toss-away, not a companion in consolation."
2,bad leather band,"Despite the warning about cancer risk, i thought that it was just that, a risk, but it was just matter or days to see how the outer surface of the band was shucked like a dry skin"
5,Just as advertised,A great watch. The craftmanship indicates that it is a Bulova product. I would buy this watch as a gift for someone special.
5,Comfort Plus,This is the most comfortable wide shoe I have ever owned. The toe box has plenty of room for arthritic toes. It looks good with both pants and skirts. I wish they had it in more colors.
3,heel problems,The shoe is well cushioned and would be totally comfortable if not for the seam on the inside of the heel. I had to put inserts in the heels to keep the seam from rubbing a blister on my heels.
1,IT UNLOCKED FBI SECRETS,"WHEN I POPPED THIS PIECE OF SLIM SHAT INTO MY COMP. THE DISK GAVE ME SECRET ALIEN CODES, THE FBI FOUND OUT AND PROMPTLY ASSASSINATED ME AND MY SLIM FRIENDS, SO IF YOU BUY THIS THE FBI WILL PROBABLY SNUFF YOU OUT"
2,unconvinced,"While I adore YA novels about queer kids, this one left me a little underwhelmed. I was just never convinced that Lissa and Kate were real people --- the character development was nil. I also didn't believe that they actually felt something for one another --- it was kind of like a romantic comedy with Julia Roberts and Hugh Grant, where all of the ingredients for a romantic comedy are there, but there's just no chemistry; it's not convincing. For a really good read, rely on the old classic Annie On My Mind --- a book which I still practically keep under my pillow, and which convinced my mom (!) that maybe, maybe this lesbian thing was OK."
3,"Sex, Drugs and Screenplays: An Unglamorous Life","A detached examination of a period in Nyswaner's life cobbled together for convenience.Nyswaner's pain is sincere. But the same substance abuse and depression that consumes and destroys lives leaves the author merely wounded with physical and emotional scars. He describes his downward spiral with mental clarity not afforded to the afflicted, but rather to an observer. His account only goes as deep as his scar tissue.We're left to ponder (and hope for) Nyswaner's progress. Perhaps it will be in his second (or would this be his third?) act in which we're given the opportunity to gain greater emotional insight into this truly talented author."
1,"Flat, lame, and boring","I was excited when i received this book and I was beyond let down. The ending was rushed and the characters seemed non-believable and 2 dimensional. Overall, unless you're looking for a quick book fix..then this isn't the book for you."
2,funny little movie,I was disappointed in this movie. Very slow moving. Had a very predictable plot. Would not recommend it. Glad it was free.
3,I LIKE ADRIAN PAUL!,"The movie was different. I got it despite some bad reviews cause Adrian Paul (the Highlander) is in it. The story was interesting, script ok, special effects cool. Not award winning, but I'm glad I puchased it."
1,Don't waste your time. Take a nap instead.,"Rented this for a scary movie night, but it turned out to be a snooze fest. Bad acting, bad graphics, sketchy plot and gaps in the story which was far fetched and disappointing. I wouldn't recommend purchasing this movie."
1,Can you say wrong place?,"The Lost Colony was ""lost"" on Roanoke Island, NC not VA. I suggest further research before making a film about a significant historical event. Roanoke Island is located off the coast of NC and is part of the Outer Banks. They have a world famous reenactment of the lost colony there every summer, hmm, I wonder why?"
3,"Impressed by delivery, not so much by the condition.","I bought this book to replace a book I had lost from the library at my university. I wasn't expecting the book until after Christmas and it came a week before Christmas. I was impressed by the delivery. The condition of the book was supposed to be ""Very Good."" I didn't read the full description of the condition of the book so I didn't realize that there would be some marks and stamps on the inside. I am hoping my school will accept this book as a replacement book. All in all, this company was great at sending the item (especially from the UK to Colorado, USA)."
5,Waffles for Reading!,"As the author ofCamp Bug Juice: A Bookworm's Camp Adventure, I really enjoyed this story and wanted to make waffles for breakfast!Horvath takes a difficult subject about growing up and keeping faith, and she turns it into this delightful story about Primrose as she navigates lost parents and waffles. The strength of the story lies in Primrose's faith in her parent's being alive and her honesty with adults. Because of this character, children and adults will enjoy this story."
5,The best moethod I've seen,"Yeah, the method is technical. A T-Square and triangle are helpful. But for complex, good looking designs, this is the book to use.Why is it different? Most books (elder Bain, Sturrock, Meehan) use a center line method--you draw the center of the knot using the grid, and then yuo trace out along either side. But the problem with this is that the line widths vary easily, and thus the knots don't look so good.This book uses a Edge line method--the edges of the knots are drawn with the grid. So all of the pieces of the knot are the same width. Which makes it look much nicer.And it makes it simpler in some ways. Since the edge lines are made with a ruler, after all of the layout work (which there is a lot, I'll admit) there is little freehand work needed, jus' for the curves. (And a circular stencil makes this so much easier)."
4,It starts out slow but then BANG!!!!,"I enjoyed the 2nd book in the Lindsey Boxer series. The first half of the book was kind of slow but when it picks up, it really kicks. Lindsey teams up once again with her three girlfriends to analyze murder cases. The 4 women are intelligent and I like the way they work together to help each other. They are true friends. Lindsey's father makes an unexpected return in this book and stirs up some bad memories for her. But his return is not for nothing and he ends up helping Lindsey out of a pretty tight jam. I would recommend 2nd Chance for all of you who have read First to Die. I makes a good 2nd book in the series. I hope the third one is not too far behind."
2,Not up to Patterson's Par,I read everything that James Patterson writes and I must say I was very disappointed with 2nd chance. It was like he just threw it together to sell another book. Certainly not one of his better offerings.
4,Enjoyable pageturner,"In this second installment to Patterson's Women's Murder Club series, the author takes the reader again on an enjoyable ride with a group of likeable characters. The plot twists and turns in true Patterson fashion, and he maintains the short chapters making it easy and quick to read.The only complaints I would have are these, first is his character development is a little lacking. The reader has a hard time getting attached to them. Second is that I've never liked the name Women's Murder Club. It sounds like something out of Scooby Doo. Put those things aside, and you have a fun read."
4,Patterson's fans won't be disappointed,"Fans of author James Patterson know he provides a lot of bang for their bucks and his newest book won't disappoint.The plot, in a nutshell- Detective Lindsay Boxer, recently promoted, is slated to investigate another murder. The killer is particularly cold and calculating, killing a number of black men and women but leaving no clues to his identity. There are unexpected twists and turns along the way to the final riveting moments (would you expect anything less from Patterson?) and enough suspense to keep readers riveted to the very last page."
1,Waste of time and money,"I'm not a lover of romantic women's fiction and Mr. Patterson seems to have watered down his style to a degree that it has more in common with Mills & Boone than the hard boiled police fiction that I enjoy. Either he isn't acquainted with any successful professional women or he's been reading too much Jilly Cooper. The heroine of the story, asked by her boss to keep a matter confidential, promptly calls up her friends (who include a newspaper reporter), for a kaffee klatch at which she reveals all. This is not the sort of behaviour that I regard as normal among women in responsible positions - nor do they go in for ""giddy hugs"". Write about men, Mr. Patterson, you know beans about women holding down significant jobs. This book is just plain silly."
4,Quick but good read.,"I admit that these are a guilty pleasure. After reading Step on a Crack, I about gave up on Patterson; I thought it was maudlin and that his writing was ""lazy""...relying on too many characters he had used in the past. I actually think that having a co-writer makes these stories better. Although certainly not requiring much brain-power, they are just plain fun to read."
3,2nd Chance is Second Rate,"Having read ALL of his previous books I found this to be an easy read, almost too easy. I don't know whether he is writing to many books lately, but they have lost some suspense. I don't find the intensity that I had found in his earlier books. Good book, good ending not great."
1,Slipshod,"Make no mistake -- this is a poorly written book that is as shallow as it is predictable. Every character is one-dimensional, and the main is character is so frustratingly idiotic that the alert reader will be be praying for her demise within a few short chapters. The book's most memorable point comes when one character wonders if a wounded person's ""arterial vein"" has been damaged. There's no such thing as an ""arterial vein,"" because veins and arteries are different -- but the writer figures that if he throws together some medical-sounding terms, no matter whether they mean anything or not, that the average reader won't know any better. The rest of the book is similarly sloppy. Unforgiveably pure trash."
4,A new Version but slightly disappointing!,"I liked the new novel with the ""Murder Club"" however it is not like the first version with everyones life involved in the story just the cop's life not the other girls. Still the twist and turns in the novel were great can't wait for the third installment."
4,Excellent,A goo murder mystery. The forming of the Womens Murder Club was interesting. I look forward to more episodes. Thank you
2,Diaappointed--,This book was not up to the standards I expect from Patterson.The plot is simplistic and predictable. I will look forward tohis next and KNOW it will be better--it couldn't be worse!!
1,Just say no,"I bought this book at the airport, hoping to have a good read before my flight and on the plane. It did not even make it on the plane with me, I returned it after reading a dozen or so pages. It is poorly written with lousy dialogue, I was amazed the author was able to find publishing."
2,Waste of Time,"The good news is that it doesn't waste a lot of time because it's a very fast read. Simple characters, simple dialogue, short chapters, simple story. It starts out fairly well but nothing believable develops in this book about the Black, female cop, her pals, or the various suspects. The dialogue between Lindsay, the homocide detective, and her female prosecutor and medical examiner friends, trying to solve a series of horrendous serial murders, reads like sorority sister chit chat. I don't think anyone who appreciates good cop mysteries, can enjoy this story."
3,Not ALL bad!,"I read this book in about 8 hours... thanks to the super short chapters Patterson ALWAYS uses! The characters were a little more developed then in '1st to Die' and that was a nice change. The revelation of the killer was ho-hum at best. (I figured out who it was after the character was introduced part way through the book!) The ending seemed to have been inspired by the movie 'Higher Learning' and was really not all that exciting. Every Patterson book I have read the endings seem to be a little disappointing, almost as if he just gives up and decides he needs some way to end the story. I will say that this book was a nice change after the horrible 'Violets are Blue'. I hope the next Cross book coming out in the Fall is better! Certainly can't be worse!"
1,Patterson,"I have read most of the Woman's Murder Club books, although not in order. I want to read them all, the are very entertaining."
2,Didn't like it as well as 1st to Die or Alex Cross Series,"Sometimes it's hard for a second book in a series to live up to the first one. This one didn't disappoint. I did finish it and somewhat enjoyed the story, but decided I probably wouldn't get the next in the series. I guess I'm spoiled to the Alex Cross series and was hoping this would be as good, it wasn't."
4,2nd change,arrived quickly . couldn't put it down. good summer reading book. recommend reading the entire serirs starting with 1st to Die
3,Not up to par,"I have become a big fan of James Patterson, especially his Alex Cross series. I really enjoyed the change of pace in ""First to Die"" but was pretty disappointed with ""2nd Chances"". This book did not have the depth of most of his books. Both the plot and characters were pretty shallow. I bought the CD version of this book on tape and I didn't care much for the voice of the reader. This is just personal preferance but it detracted somewhat from my enjoyment."
3,2nd in the series,"The women's murder club has to solve another case, this one deals with a racist. According to the clues given, he's a sharpshooter, and very cocky since he killed police officers. The twist is, it deals with Lindsay's past with her father. He was never there, and all of a sudden he wants to be in her life."
2,Sex In The City Girls Grow Up & Solve Mysteries,"This was my introduction to the Women's Murder Club. I couldn't help but compare them to the characters in the TV show, ""Sex In The City"". The city is San Francisco and there is little or no sex going on, but the character's relationships are adolescent and the dialog between them is atrocious (""The margarita posse rides again"". Yikes!). They set out to solve the mystery of a serial murder who is killing black cops and their relatives. The mystery itself is a good one and kept me interested. When it is seemingly solved, there are about 60 pages left so I realized a large red herring had been served up. The plot saved this story from being a total washout, but these characters left a lot to be desired. I can understand Patterson's desire to branch out into different scenarios (I was getting a little tired of Alex Cross too), but he took a wrong turn with this one."
