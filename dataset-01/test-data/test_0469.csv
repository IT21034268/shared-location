5,"It's not the Art of Noise, but what is?","At first glance, it seems true that this CD could just as well be called ""Plastic Bananas: The Drum and Bass Collection"" for all it has to do with AON. However, if you can get past this disappointment, it is an excellent compilation. Though there are few explicit sounds from the AON's catalog, this CD as a whole does as good a job in sketching a landscape in sound as the best discs of the real AON, such as In No Sense? Nonsense! or their newer Seduction of Claude Debussy. In fact, it may be the most imaginative CD of its genre I've ever heard, managing to be evocative while conforming to the rather strict DnB form. AON fans tend to be the kind who don't want to listen to the same trite sound over and over again anyway, and this disc is no less original or interesting than one written by AON themselves. Though I've owned it for years, it's still in the short stack of CDs I play often, which is high praise indeed."
4,"A bit eccentric, but good nonetheless","I have read this book and plan on using some of the monologues in some upcoming auditions I have. I was, however, disappointed in the fact that there were more for men than for women, so more than half of the book was useless to me. Be wary, some of the audition pieces are a bit eccentric and need to be edited for language (depending on the show), but for the most part I was quite pleased with what I read, and I recommend it for new actors and actresses."
5,CAN'T GO WRONG HERE,"An excellent sourcebook for actors searching for Monologues for auditions or performances. Sections for both male and female actors. Many of the monologues were written specifically for this book, so have not been widely performed. Background notes provided to set the scene and mood of the performance. A wide range of emotional content is also here. If you cannot find a good audition piece here, you probably won't find it!"
1,NOT A CHILDRENS BOOK!!!,"I bought this book thinking I could use it later on. I am 15. I was wrong. This is a book entirly devoted to the feelings and actions of adults. It has nothing to do with someone younger than 21 or 22.If you are a person who doesn't like language or to openly talk about your sexual life, then don't get it. If it doesn't bother you, then this is your book.I can see how this book could land you a lead role. It does have some good monologues, but they aren't for everyone. Unless your trying to land the lead role as a 40 year old alcoholic with a bad sexual life, look for something else."
1,Decent Read... Poor Resource,"I've seen this book of monolgues in many places, and one day decided to pick it up and see if it was any good. I was looking for two monologues to use for a college audition, and this book helped me as much as a cold. Though the monologues are decently written, and may be interesting, very few are actually useable. Not recommended for those seeking a collection of monologues to use for acting."
1,Lopsided,"On the surface it's a good looking soccer ball. I bought the green and white one for my 9 y/o son about two weeks ago for his AYSO soccer practice. We took it to the game today to practice with and the referee said he wanted to use it in the game.....until he inspected it. That's when he told us it can't be used in the game because, and I quote, ""It's egg shaped"". I didn't notice it before probably because I didn't bother to inspect it myself. Sure enough, it's lopsided. What gets me is that a company that makes balls for a living can't figure out how to make a round ball round. Save your money on this one. It's worthless junk for soccer purposes."
1,Wouldn't hold air,"We pumped it up, wrote our name on it so it wouldn't get lost at soccer practice, and set it down. Ten minutes later, we had a deflated ball. Did it again; same result. The stem doesn't appear to be well connected to the actual ball. Amazon gave us no trouble about returning it, even though we'd written our name on it. Will try another brand..."
3,Soccer ball,"I bought the ball as a Christmas gift for my granddaughter. It arrived very quickly, but it arrived semi-deflated. No problem, we thought, because we had also bought a ball pump. We thought it was a little deflated to accommodate packing size. Unfortunately, the ball wouldn't hold its air. The company we purchased it from took it back as an exchange with no problem. The ball is a 5-star ball, but the disappointment and inconvenience the original shipment caused lowers my rating to 3 stars. Goods should be inspected for defects before shipping."
3,Gnerally helpful but not well organized and dismissve,"""Multicultural Manners"" was an interesting cruise through the often dauniting seas of custom and manners. Dresser provides succinct vignettes of real world cultural clashes that lend an air of reality to the many differences between peoples. Its easy to read format and small narrratives made for a quick read. I actually found myself in need of some of the information I had gleaned from the pages. The work, however, is disappointingly shallow. It fails to explore the underlying principles of cultural variations in favour of a brief glance at surface phenomena. Dresser's attitude toward non-western medicine was both uninformed and arrogantly dismissive. She would have done well to avoid the issue altogether rather than flaunt her raging ignorance before the world. All in all ""Multicultural Manners"" was a fun read, worth the time and investment."
5,A basic reference even for the pros,"So you think you know it all? This slim, artfully produced, thorough glossary of terms is beautifully illustrated, has clear descriptions of all those mysterious processes on museum labels, including a few even you might not have known, and is as useful in a collector's library as in a contemporary practitioner's."
5,NICE,This was a very nice buy. It is working out just wonderful in our tiny bathroom. I'd certainly buy another one!
5,Wonderful Rendering,A handsome retelling of this Russian folktale with superb illustrations by Gennady Spirin. A wonderful gift to give for all ages.
2,Great if your into stories with Poligamy,"The artwork is beautiful I have to say, but we're giving it away. Legend, fact or folk lore, if it teaches or presents principles we don't believe in we don't want it in our home."
1,This is not prog nor decent pop!!,"As a prog fan I can say that We are lucky if We don't listen to this very light and without ideas pop album. Prog rock (and generally prog music), is REALLY something special. I forgive those who try to catalogue this as a prog album, because it means that for sure they don't know anything about prog music!!Unfortunately John had to compose commercial music to survive and it seems impossible, thinking of his great job with UK and King Crimson. Instead We are lucky if We are still listening to his last issue live with a prog band (The Steve HACKETT band, in the amazing ""Tokyo Tapes"")"
4,Sabbath illegitimate child,"Perhaps the best album of ""Pentagram"" - quite unexpectedly shows that their musical palette has many colours, and is not monochromatic. The band is still unashamedly dragging the shoes of ""Black Sabbath"" and the overall tempo of the album is following the walk of arthritic dinosaur (""Swans"" could have been another source of inspiration -Children of God/World of Skin, but whether we're talking doom or black metal, it's very good - the vocals might be not Ozzy, but still these are vocals, and not brainless growling.Sure, it's not the most cheerful easy listening, and it can be strongly recommended to the shrinks for the diagnosis of early stages of manic depression or suicidal tendencies, but I really enjoyed.Keep in mind that there is another ""Pentagram""Anatolia(from Turkey) - which I do advice to get"
2,filters,"Very high quality product, metal rapped cotton filter, not cheep foam, but... The air filters have no built in plenums that keep the air flow strait and un-turbulent. If the air passes the ports at the intake of the carburetor is not even the carburetor will not have the proper air-fuel mixture. The factory air box has such plenums. I could not make the K-N filters work properly and returned them."
1,Broke in half - Worthless,The weight of the flag and pole broke the pole insert from the bracket at the weld.
1,Rotten encyclopaedia,"The encyclopaedia's content is absolutely rotten. Never mind the interface, multimedia, etc. What defines the quality of an encyclopaedia is its CONTENT! Twenty some thousand skimpy articles in World Book, wot? Both Encarta and Britannica have more articles that are of longer length.World Book was created for infants and primary school students. If you're in 2ndary school or uni, this is nought but rubbish. I can't believe any self-respecting adult would give kudos to this."
4,Handy.,A good reference for basic stroke drills. The explanations are sufficient enough to start doing drills and progress from very easy to moderately advanced. If you are already familiar with drills this book makes a useful aide-memoire to refer to.
3,Not enough examples...,"This one won't set the world of programming on fire, especially if you want examples to draw upon. Alot of the material is available in the online Visual C++ help."
4,Knows what he is talking about,"Swanson has a long history working with organizations and as a academician regarding this text's topic. He writes well; explaining his theories so that they are easily grasped--even if one doesn't always agree with them.I am not sure this would be a bedtime read, but for a student who wants some basis for either OD or training and development, this is a good place to start."
2,Not what I expected,Definitely disappointed too expensive for the poor quality of product. Could not make a good frappe or milkshake for nothing!
4,My mom loves this,"Bought as a gift recently for Mom. She loves it. Altho' the numbers are a bit small, she likes everything else about it a lot, esp. the speaker phone option. It was easy enough for her to figure out how to record the outgoing message (she's NOT technical at all) and a friend helped her set it up easily out of the box.I might get one for myself now that she's loving hers a lot."
4,Confusing menu,"Great phone, have owned similar in the past. Owners manual somewhat confusing for setup. 3rd handset should be a freebee as comm equipment is dropping in price as new bells and whistles are being introduced daily. this unit will become obsolete and un available within a few months. Big box stores are offering same at competetive price but we are taxed on local purchase!"
5,It works for us,So far we like the phone. We are still trying to learn everything about it. I love the alarm
1,Not good for active children,"I bought this software for my nieces... and they were pretty excited to see Dora on the box. They ripped it open with glee and we installed it.Well, I guess Quality Control is missing in the Lost City - the software simply wasn't translating my mouse clicks in a standard way, and so interacting with the software became a adventure! The software worked great in terms of seeing and hearing Dora... but when we tried to interact with Dora and her friends, well, that was an exercise in frustration!As a software developer, I found it unusable. Totally unusable. It was so wrong, I sent a note to tech support.Tech support responded in a day or two, but unfortunately their reply didn't offer any advice in correcting my usability issue.I suggest something else - my nieces were very disappointed. I was disappointed too."
1,boo! lissen at yo own risk!,"first off, iwas anticipatin an phat beat, instead it gives me stuffish that ive heard before. its terrible."
5,nice and good interface,"The game takes away some of the time spending micromanagement tasks that most games have... Instead of spending time figuring out where to place buildings (required for upgrades and extra units) they are automatically built within the city, this allows for quicker army setup and allows to focus more on the strategy skills... I must admit the computer opponet is very clever and it takes time to adjust to this way of playing...Overall, the game is great it doesn't allow for customized cities but then again we all develop a standard building placement plan after a couple of games...The random map feature does a great job of laying out new maps for unlimited play alternatives...."
1,the biggest waste of money,"wow...this is so much like the warcraft battlechest that its not even worth buying. i mean, you have hero units that don't die, gain experience and cast spells. just go out and get the battlechest for about half the price and voila...you have Kohan two.if i could, i would get my money back"
5,Starting to Do Fabric Landscaps,"Excellent directions from start to finish. Easy to understand, learn to select fabrics, make a pattern, put it together and embellish it. It's that easy. A wonderful book for the person who wants to do a landscape quilt and doesn't know where/how to begin. Good examples and pleasant reading. I puchased two additional copies for friends."
1,Antique Clocks Identification and Price Guide CD-ROM and Internet Resource,I was surprised when the CD-ROM arrived and I opened it to find only a pdf file.It was difficult to read. The most annoying feature was NO INDEX. Without the index the CD-ROM is vertually useless as an identification guide. Little information on the history of the companies. Little information about Europen clocksThe Internet Resource is limited.Do not waste your money on the guide.
2,"Looks good, fts hand nicely, now if it only wrote well.","The look and feel of this pen is great but its very ""picky"" about what it wants to work on. for instance: If you are using a pad of paper the dents created by writing on the top sheet will cause the pen to ""skip"" on the following page, also if your writing on thin paper (ie carbon-less multi copy forms) it wont write. The Ball/Ink is just far to finicky about when it will actually leave a mark.Bottom line:Pen works well enough if your writing on a ""normal"" single sheet of paper on a hard surface, but forget about using it on legal pads or multi-part forms."
3,Good for the money!,"I just received my pens today. For the price, you can't go wrong. They may not be the most well made pens out there but they definitely get the job done!"
3,Pens,Not much I can say here as pens are pens. They are the correct color and the count was correct.
3,Beastly...2.5 stars,"We went to see this movie hoping that it would be good, but it just wasn't that good. Sure it has some sweet romantic moments, but I was disappointed by the ending because it was so anti-climatic. There was a LOT of potential here, but any angst or real conflict (moving moments) were missed. In addition some parts of the plot simply don't make sense. However if you are in the mood for a sweet/cute movie, then this is the movie for you.Overall fairly entertaining, average movie..."
3,"Ok, but not great","I had high expectations for this flick, but it didn't quite make it to the level I wanted. I really enjoyed the performances by supporting characters, but many key moments of acting on the part of the two leads were less than stellar. I had trouble understanding why they reacted to each other the way they did in several situations and the reactions weren't believable... rather obviously staged and unnatural. Overall, an OK film, but disappointing compared to expectations."
5,Perfect movie for a date!!!!!,"My heart was really touched by this modern-retelling of theliterature classic,""Beauty & The Beast.""ALEX PETTYFER and VANESSAHUDGENS chemistry is UNDENIABLE on screen.And PETTYFER pulls you inwith his performance as the good-looking guy who only cares abouthimself and then slowly but surely transforms into a caring personwith a loving-heart.I would highly-recommend this movie to any onedue solely to its strong moral to the story about it's not what'son the outside that counts but on the inside!!!!!!!!!"
1,HORRIBLE,"I usually love a sappy teen romance, but this movie is AWFUL. The message: Looks don't matter, but money sure does, especially if you plan to hold the girl you've been stalking prisoner in your mansion. I didn't believe for a minute that these two fell in love or lived happily ever after. I thought the ""Beast"" was a self-centered jerk both before and after his transformation, and was convinced he'd go right back to his old ways after he got his looks back. And I'm supposed to believe a 'happy ending' where the girl accepts without comment the fact that he lied to her about his identity for a year? I watched the movie with my teenage son, and the best part was when we paused it to make fun of how stupid it was."
5,Movie,"I enjoyed this movie. But, my sister bought it on my account. Oops. A tale of ""It's what is on the inside that matters most."" We live in a world that is visual and unfortunately, the outside appearance of people matter to pretty much everyone. He didn't look horrific to me... I'm definitely glad he wasn't as superficial in the end as in the beginning of the movie."
2,Okay Movie,Maybe this wasn't the worst movie but it certainly wasn't the worst it was far from it. Beastly is a story about some stuck up private school snot who becomes a Beast after insulting a witch. He needs to find someone who can truly love him. It's a good premise but it has been done before most notably in the amazing Disney classic movie Beauty and the Beast. It was an unnecessary remake. The acting of Vanessa Hudgens and Alex Pettyfar is very amateur.
2,Need captioning for Deaf feature...,Where is the option for closed captioning? Not there.. need more support for the Deaf viewers. Thanks. Would give more stars if was captioned.
1,Terrible,"It has been a long time since I've seen a movie so bad. Bad plot, bad acting, bad lighting, all bad."
1,a sad adaptation of a book to movie,"It totally ruined the magic in the book :(...it was boring, no chemistry between the main actors...the only good thing was kendra character played by mary-kate olsen."
3,It had potential...,"but it didn't quite live up to it. The cast was great (I actually really liked the Olsen twins' performance as the witch)and the storyline is a classic, but the circumstance in which these two came together was so ridiculous. I can accept a spell by a vengeful witch, but a father leaving his son alone, a dad leaving his daughter in the hands of total strangers, a blind man miraculously cured??? It was a tough sell. I watched it and did enjoy it a bit but I hoped for more."
1,Save Your Money,"Vanessa Hudgens playing a street-wise child of a father with a drug addiction falls short. The cheesy lines that are trades between her and Alex Pettyfer don't work either. I had to force myself to finish watching it, because I didn't want to waste my money on this rental."
1,Horrible Piece of Garbage,"The teen dark romantic fantasy genre has a captive audience that is more than willing to shell out out $ and Hollywood is more than happy to churn out mindless trash. This is what is wrong with the system. Avoid this, don't pay for it, let your daughter watch on cable soon enough. 86 minutes of your life never to be recovered."
4,See this movie!,"No, Tami Horiuchi missed the movie. One of the best scenes I've seen in a long, long time is the one at the party where Kyle first talks with the girl who will play the Beauty. Both Kyle and the Beauty are hesitant, a bit confused, and unsure of themselves, as almost always happens with young people. It's fun to watch. And the music is just right. Another good scene is when Hunter watches the Beauty leave her apartment, buy a book, and skip down the sidewalk while talking to herself. She enjoys being alive and Hunter enjoys her enjoyment. Benedict XVI said in Barcelona that ""a work of beauty (and the girl is a work of beauty, made by her parents, with God's guidance) is pure gratuity, it (she) calls us to freedom and draws us away from selfishness."" True, adult men in this movie are weak, arrogant, and wrong. Kyle's father, for instance. But isn't this a real problem today? Ms. Horiuchi should see the movie a few more times!"
5,"Great film, LOVE Shatner","What can I SAY??`I Love William Shatner, and I think its an interesting story concept, who better to write it than ""THE Captain""....If you are a Shatner and Star Trek fan you should order this film. Thanks again Amazon...."
5,"YES, EROTICISM!","As a collector of art photography, I am, naturally, interested in young, up-and-coming photographers and their work. I saw a published photograph by Andrea Modica, found out that she lived and worked in upstate New York relatively near me, and then, a short time later, saw this wonderful paperbound collection in the Smithsonian bookshop. These black and white, almost classically composed, portraits of minor league players are brilliant character studies which constantly surprise the viewer. They show friendship and athleticism, a competitive spirit and, yes, eroticism. They are magnificent. Strangely enough, the highly informative interview with the photographer is uncredited. If you are interested in photography and/or baseball, you owe it to yourself to buy this book."
5,works well - for some,"I am not sure St. John's Wort will work for most people (see NIH study on SJW), but it works well for some. I was using a cheaper brand - but then that brand seemed to lose it's effectiveness. Was it me? Was I too stressed out?I switched to the brand used in testing - Kira. The SJW effect came back strongly. This works well.Start here for a few months - then try cheaper brands if you want. They may not work as well, since there is no government regulation ensuring quality."
4,Will keep buying,"definitely took the edge off depression, no side effects, didn't help anxiety, however. Noticed a change in my mood almost immediately. Started off with 2 boxes (about a months supply) and will order more. Didn't want to take something prescribed with harsh side effects, as I am sensitive to medications. Would recommend to anyone."
2,St. John's Wort,"I've used various products for St. John's Wort, but this one seems to be neutral in terms of benefits. In other words, there doesn't appear to be any effect."
3,Buy something else,It worked for a while but eventually gave up the ghost. Worthless unless you can get it almost perfectly level. I think mine spent too much time on my casio watch band and around metal objects thus making it inoperative. It's ok as long as you know it's limitations. Suitable if you're in a pinch and need something.
5,i love the sound track,i have it and listeon all the time. i would listeon to the opening song when the show wasn't on.they should put more cd's from the show.it is good ..
4,Colorful mix,"Great album! The CD includes a variety of songs all straight from the WB's ""Smallville"": Remy Zero's smash theme song ""Save Me"", Sixpence None The Richer's cover of Crowded House's ""Don't Dream It's Over"", Five For Fighting's ""Superman"", and mine and my wife's personal favorite, LifeHouse's ""Everything"". Quite a few suprises seem to spice up the flavor, such as Weezer's ""Island In The Sun"" (which is really catchy), and ""Nuclear"" by Ryan Adams.I give it a 4 (even though it deserves a 5) because the music is so good it should've been a double CD compilation of music from the show."
5,Why did this CD show up in Rap & Hip-Hop top sellers,no offense to those who listen to this genre of music.this more directed at Amazons categorization system.
5,as a member of the asante program...,"As a member of mr. eldridge's ASANTE PROGRAM and a former prisoner, I must say that it is GOOD to see my mentor's work available. When I was lost, I was a theif, an addict, a criminal. The prison system did not rehabilitate me, but rather, made me better at my aforementioned skills. it wasnt until I heard about the Asante Program and I chose to lead a life as CHRIST wanted me to lead. I began studying the booklist the PROGRAM provided, I began to better myself, I began to take up a trade.The Asante Program helped me become what I am, a GODLY man able to walk upright like the MAN I am.Now I am on parole and i am employed as a printer in Huntsville, Texas - where my dream of being a graphic artist is finally coming true. If this may sound like a testimony, it is...the thoughts in this book brought me there...Good job mr. eldridge, good job...we all are forever in debt...Sincerely,Nathaniel Wigham - 664935"
3,A good mix of more poetry and less jam,"I discovered this text while I was at a book store in Virginia that did not have it in stock - so I got it here. A good mix of politics, thoughts all weaved into a significant view of the struggle many people go through.I expect as time goes on, this author will have something more to say and people will really listen.......especially in these days where there is more ""JAM"" than Poetry in the excessiveness of our times....the modern day poets thinking of their art as an extension of hip hip, when in actuality it (poetry) is the original parent of the artform itself.Here is a poet who understands that point, but also recognizes the influence of the artform itself!Mykal"
2,Not that helpful for active boys,This game seemed quite slow pace and difficult to get active young boys involved in.
5,great game,"I bought the Ungame for my family and it has created some wonderful conversations. things you learn about each other still, it is enlightening. You could also use this in school in a group or advisory."
2,Bargain Rack Merchandise,"At best, this CD is lackluster. If you want some good Bill Wyman, check out Willy and the Poor Boys. This CD is a terrible disappointment, and not worth buying. Believe me, Bill Wyman can do a lot better than this."
2,You Better Move On,"What do Jeff Beck, Joe Satriani, Steve Vai, and Bill Wyman have in common?...........THEY CAN'T SING!! Yes the music on this, Monkey Grip Glue, and the self titled album is decent. But to ask people to overlook the singing on a rock'n'roll record is like asking someone to overlook the brass in a marching band, you can't do it. If you're looking for a good solo album by a bass player head for Ronnie Lane, John Entwistle, or Sting."
4,The Answer to Boring Staff Meetings!,"Stop gathering wool and composing shopping lists during those long, boring staff meetings! Start observing the body language of co-workers and bosses. It's fun! This book will get you started on your new 'hobby'.My kind of book - lots of pictures and the text is concise and to the point. Unlike, oh I don't know, long boring staff meetings!!"
1,Reductionist Rumi,"I am not sure I should write this review, since I have been unable to finish the book so far. The author's pedigree is also intimidating. Yet this book is a cold emotionless dissection, mostly uninteresting except for an academic who has long lost the sense of who or what he's studying. The book takes Rumi apart like a corpse on a slab. To get through it so far, I've escaped periodically to Coleman Bark's Essential Rumi. His brief introduction and forward alone provides more insight into what Rumi is about than the three-quarters of the book I've managed to struggle through so far.Prodded on by the other reviews to the suspicion that I may have missed something here, I plan to finish the book and reread it again. Yet I should warn others that reading this book as an introduction to Rumi may be like viewing a bearskin rug as an introduction to wildlife. After a reread, I will revisit this review, perhaps reedit it at that time.Sept.07"
2,Not a terrible book... but far from the best.,"This guide is good enough if you just need some help struggling through the game the first time, providing useful strategies for defeating bosses and such. But it falls short when one would like it to go beyond the bare bones -- the pictures are small, black and white, and of the JAPANESE version of the game. Not much help. The maps, too, are crudely drawn and difficult to interpret. This is strictly for RPG novices... who can't find the official guide, that is."
1,Design essentials organic deep cleansing shampoo,"I was very disappointed with this product. Very drying to my hair, would not recommend. The other products in this line have been great but this one is terrible."
5,Very nice!,"Very nice placemats. I'll be giving these as a gift that is sure to please this Patriots fan.Great stuff for the price. I must admit I didn't open the wrapping or try spilling anything on them myself, so I can't speak to the durability, but they seem pretty rugged."
2,NEW AGE RELATIONSHIPS,"Read ""a course in miracles"" as a prerequisite to this book. ""A course in miracles"" is a dusty 19th century folk-art/religious cult of Millard and Myrtle Fillmore,a typical pre-Freudian, highly artistic interperatation of Man and God. Joan's book is no less pre-Freudian, and certainly less dusty. New age writers have no proffesional credentials other than their lofty artistic impression of man's (and, ahem..., womans) divine nature. Don't bother with this one."
5,Dug it .Really.,"While I really dug this book and the characters I have one complaint. As a dark skinned black woman my hope was to finally read a book that celebrated the beautiful and varied hues of blackness. Instead what I found was one hue. One type for love (caramel, light coffee) and one hue for the help (dark ebony). As an ebony woman I would like Ms. Ray to know that I am worthy of being loved by a strong brother. That I too am worthy of being cherished and adored. There are many men who prefer a deeper hued woman. As a professional non domestic it disturbed me to see so may stereotypes embraced in Ms. Ray's books. She is however a very good storyteller and I would rather read about a light skinned sister than no sister at all. I just think that as a black woman herself , Ms. Ray should be more aware."
3,Conclusion of Falcon Series,"For those of you who read the Falcon Series ""Until there was you"" is a must read. True, this story wasn't nearly as exciting as those in the falcon series but its sort a conclusion. In ""Heart of the Falcon: Daniel Falcon makes several references to his cousin Luke and ""Until there was you"" gives us Luke's story. While Luke Grayson and Daniel Falcon share physical similarities, Luke's story and his appeal just didn't compare with Daniel's. Anyway, why this story wasn't included in the Falcon Series is a mystery to me but, it's still an ""O.K."" read."
2,"doesn't work for me as fantasy, either","i had to buy this for a course in mesoamerican religion. there wasn't any in it, nor any anthropology either. just a lot of lame existentialist homosexual fantasy. probably when it was published in 1969 (and when it was written even earlier) it was a lot more interesting and thought-provoking to point out that the christian religion practiced by the priest at the mission did not make anyone any happier (or any better people) than whatever cultural norms being practiced by the more ""primitive"" peoples; that's old news for most of us today. there is no mention of any other spiritual beliefs than christianity, therefore no objective comparison can be made. i haven't seen the documentary yet, but proving that he really went somewhere, met someone, and visited a tribe doesn't come close to proving all the incidents described in the book."
4,PRODIGIOUS RESEARCH AND THOROUGH SCHOLARSHIP,"Recreating the life of one of Christianity's central figures is not an easy task. Michael Grant does it well.Saint Peter, the multi-faceted figure for whom the largest Christian church building in the world is named remains an enigmatic man. Thanks to the prodigious research and thorough scholarship of the author, much of that mystery is dispelled.Beginning with an explanation of how information for this study was obtainted, Grant then moves into the story of Peter when Jesus was alive. This is followed by Peter's years after Jesus's death and then his martyrdom in Rome.Illustrations, references and bibliography are included in the volume.- Gail Cooke"
4,A Personal Treatment of Canada's Greatest Disaster,"Virtually unknown in the United States, the Halifax explosion of 1917 was the largest man-made explosion prior to the atomic age. Devestating Atlantic Canada's largest city, the human impact is well traced in Kitz's book."
4,NICE!,"I don't wear this as a costume, I wear it out to the club without the ears. Only problem is it is always sliding down or up! Cute though."
5,"Kind of an old-school design, but it works for me","I use these when I both jog and bike pretty much every day (in all kinds of weather) and I haven't found anything that fits as well, gives great sound reproduction, but still allows me to hear and be aware of the outside world. They are also surprisingly rugged and I can generally use the same pair for 18-24 months before they eventually give out. I keep worrying that Sony might discontinue them so I stocked up a on a couple of pair last time I ordered them."
1,Too big for my ears,"These headphones won't stay on my ears at all. When I press them into my ear the sound is really bad too. I wouldn't recommend anyone buy these, even if they have big ears."
2,Too pricey,"I got a rather inexpensive pair (with shipping, it cost something around $8), and yet I still feel ripped off. The reason I was looking for new headphones was because the buds that I had were going in and out of working, and they fell out of my ear when I went to work out. These are fine for working out, but the sound quality really stinks. Also, when you turn the part that plugs into the MP3 device, it makes a fuzzy sound (another thing I was angry about with my current pair).I realize that I didn't buy high-quality headphones, but these are really quite bad. If you need over-the -ear headphones, look for them somewhere else, I'd say."
4,Cheap and durable earphones.,"After many earphones failed me, I finally found this nifty one that has lasted me for about a year now. Before buying this Sony model, I would use Skull Candy, HP, Phillips, and they would only last for 1-3 months. And when I say three months, I really meant that I would use it until only one earphone works, and when all the metal wiring are exposed. I used them until I couldn't anymore.What I really like about these earphones is that the ear bud piece is simple, other earphones have removable buds, and spongy appliques, but this one has no room for customizing, making it very durable.I also like that the jack is bent.The ear bud section is a little wide. Causing the ear piece to fall out many times. I would have to really cramp it into my ears, making my ears feel swollen and painful."
2,"Owned 3 of these, each have lasted about a year. Not worth it.","Why did it take three pairs for me to finally learn my lesson and stop buying these?Well, they have great sound, are extremely comfortable, and won't fall off. The loops do catch onto things, but the thick plastic of the headphone wires allow for easy untangling. The price is also very decent.But don't waste your money. I've owned three of these, and all three gave out in one single ear after about a year. Maybe they're not meant to be that portable, or maybe they're just cheap. Either way, I'm done with these."
1,"Cheap, poor fit",I was looking for a decent pair of headphones to wear while running and these were NOT it. Uncomfortable + loose + poor sound = unhappy customer.
5,Unbelievable value for the money,"Given the ~$11 cost, i'm amazed with the comfort and sound quality. Very stable when working out/running. Highly recommend. THis is my 5th pair, and will buy more as they wear out. Don't expect the sound you get from $100 earbuds, but I'm very pleased....."
1,"Disappointed, to say the least!","I was looking for something that was easy to keep in my ears; I guess I should have also been looking for quality sound. I got neither with these. It could be me though; maybe I'm ""earphone challenged"", but I have a heck of a time getting these coordinated in my ears, they don't fit comfortably and after I do get them in, then the disappointment of listening to my music begins. The music has nothing -- no quality whatsoever. I think I just took it for granted because they're from Sony. Oh well...(sigh), another pair of headphones relegated to the ""only in an emergency"" drawer! And thus, my search for good, durable, user-friendly earphones continues ..."
4,Good Choice For My Needs,"The sound quality is o.k. given that this is an inexpensive headset. I use these when I work out as these are attached to my Nano.I don't like ear buds because they invariably fall out, so I really need something that will sit securely on my ears and still be comfortable. This fits the bill. While they are probably not the best quality, I have yet to encounter any problems with these and they do take quite a beating on a daily basis.While these aren't made to completely drown out all sounds, they do a good job and are a deal for under $10."
4,Had my previous set for 4 years,"I've ran hundreds of miles with my previous set and was very happy with how they felt and sat during all the motion. When they finally went out, I just wanted another pair to replace them with. Have been very happy with them all along."
3,Good Sound But Too Big,"These earphones provide good sound, but are not the right size for my ears. I bought them because the ipod earbuds don't stay in my ears. These headphones tend to slip off my ears when I move my head. When jogging, I wear a headband over my ears and they are perfectly secure. Good quality for the price."
2,Doesn't stay on.,"I was wanting headphones that would not fall off during exercise. I have never had much luck with earbuds, so I found these and thought they would stay put. I was about 25 feet into a moderate paced run when they fell out. The problem is they aren't adjustable and don't fit snug to your ears...and the cord is waaaaaayyyy too short too. Garbage."
1,Poor Quality,"I was looking for a non-slip headphone to wear while jogging. Reading some of the reviews, this seemed like a good and inexpensive product. However, one week into the use, I find this headphone to be poorly designed. The grip does not fit well over my ears and the headphones stay outside of the ear canal. Also, the sound is directed towards the front. So, I will have to raise the volume to hear the sound. The sound can be heard by those standing next to me.The headphones also gave me constant shocks when I used it with my laptop, although this did not happen when I used it with the MP3 player. The sound quality is great. But I am discarding this headphone for reasons stated above."
4,Sony MDR-J10s get the job done,"For the price, you get what you pay for: reasonable sound quality and earphones that actually stay in place during strenuous activity (at least for me).As others have mentioned you get a lot of mid-range with these earphones. The solution for me was adjusting my mp3 player settings (Creative Zen V Plus). Playing with the equalizer and turning on bass boost helped out quite a bit. So, they stay put and actually sound pretty good.The consumer reports ""best buy"" Sony MDR-ED21LP earphones do sound better to me. I just cannot keep those earphones in place while I workout."
3,Were good while they lasted,the hook design is great when jogging or during any other activity that requires lots of movement. Even found that I can press them against the pillow while resting and they don't even hurt your ears. Only thing is that they lasted only for a year.
1,"Really cheap, really crappy.","Seriously, what are you expecting for $10? These are super cheap and super crappy. Save your money and spend $20 and get a higher quality product."
4,Great upgrade for any mp3 player to use while working out.,"These headphones are definitely a great upgrade from the cheap ones that come with any ipod; they sound better, feel great and won't come off your ears.I have read some people's reviews criticizing the sound quality... Come on! if you were expecting BOSE quality on 10 dollar sport headphones you will never be happy with any deals.But if all you want is a set of headphones to use while working out that sound 100 times better than the set that comes with your Mp3 player, then this are the set for you... I even use these while shadowboxing and hitting the bag."
2,Not good for smaller ears,"I just bought these and I could not get them in my ears. My husband did it for me and I found out I wasn't doing it wrong, the fact is they are not adjustable and not moldable, so on my ""danty ears"" as hubby put it, they would still fall out of my ears at just a touch of them. Just like the ipod buds do. I wanted them for excercise.But on the other hand, they fit my husbands ear perfect wrapping around. So I gave them 2 stars for that. One size doesn't fit all!"
4,Tried and True,"I must say I've been buying these headphones for about the last 10 years. I'm not that old buy they are definitely a good pair of cheap headphones to own. The sound quality is pretty decent, nothing too fancy but not horrible. They stay in your ears pretty well too. I've probably been through about 12 pairs of them all stopped working for various reasons, from accidents to me just yanking on them too much. All in all for less than 10 bucks they're not a bad buy. If you're a bit gentler on them than I am I'm sure you can get them to last longer than I did. Also they were perfect for shoving under my helmet when I was on my motorcycle."
3,Great - but short lived,"The sound quality? Decent, but not amazing. These are amazingly practical, but give out aftr a couple of months. Considering the price, they are good. But it always disappointing when they once again begin to give out."
2,Item didn't fit - won't stay on my ears to run,"I was so excited to try this product based on reviews - the idea is great, and it was comfortable, but wouldn't stay on my ears to run no matter what I tried, therefore useless to me based on what I wanted them for. Ear Buds have never worked for me so was hopeful this would - I am a relatively small person so might work if I had bigger ears? The sound was fine, etc., just wouldn't fit me."
2,Fair,I bought 3 pairs of these headphones for my kids for running. They do not stay in very well. They are too big for the ear.
5,fast delivery and great product,I purchased these to listen to my lectures and or music while in class at nights. They work great and they look good and i got them cheap and fast. This was a win win..
3,Ok for the price.,"I have bought them to work out. Did not like that it gets tangled easy & very long cord. They stopped working after 5 months. I go thru so many, I was surprised how long they last. Can't complain for the price."
2,not so great,"I've had a pair of these for about a while now, they'll last a long time because i don't use them. They are fairly comfortable but not great for long use as the bud which is in close constant contact w/ the inside of your ear is made of hard plastic. The other downside is that they produce very little bass unless you hold them right in side the ear opening, other than that you're only going to hear mids and highs."
4,Nice headphones,"This is perfect for running. It stays snug around my ears so nothing to fuss about while I'm running and lightweight. Also, the sound is great for my needs."
2,"great, if only i could hear the music to keep me going.","I bought the headphones for one reason,to workout. I like my music loud so i can feel motivated. The hooks stay on my ears great but one speaker wouldn't stay in place inside my ear. I thought the plastic hook could be reshaped but no luck. they are well made and durable.Soon after I just put them away as back up and bought a a new pair of clip on headphones. They were better and more comfortable."
3,"Ok, but not the best.","I have been in search of the perfect ear buds while I run. Unfortunately, these were not the best that I have found. Although, they do have a unique design and look great and even sound good, these kept slipping out of my ears. Plus, I really didn't like the way the speakers are set to the direction of the front of the ear, not directly into the ear tunnel. The design doesn't make much sense to me really. These may be good for static listening while seated, but not for running.So far, Panasonic's wrap around ear buds have worked the best for me, and I've tried a lot of them."
3,Not quite as good as I was hoping.,"These earphones are good for walking and maybe running. However, jumping around or very bouncy jogging makes these earbuds fall out of my ears. The sound is also very quiet compared to the stock earbuds that came with my iPod. In addition, the jack seems a little small, so it's very easy to accidentally pull out of the plug in when moving. All in all, they are okay, but I probably will look for different headphones next time I am shopping for them."
2,you get what you pay for,"Bad sound quality and very little blocking out of external noise. They also shocked my ears a lot. Then again, they stay in your ears and are super cheap. I couldn't deal with the shocking my ears so I'm never going to use them again but maybe that was just my pair... I'd advise spend a few more dollars and get something else"
2,Not great,"I bought these hoping to have a good pair of headphones to use while running. They do stay on while I am running, but the sound quality is pretty terrible. The way the earbud is designed, the speaker barely projects into your ear. Also I feel like the size of the headphones were made for someone with giant ears. I would say I have average sized ears and they feel really big on me. I suppose they get the job done for $10, but I wouldn't buy them again."
4,Good headphones for the price.,"They look very nice, and are very comfortable. Sound quality isn't superb, but for this price you shouldn't be expecting even what you get. Worth it for sure."
2,Worked well for 7 months,"These earphones were good only for 7 months. I've owned other earphones from various manufacturers but they just don't go bad so quickly! I used it for my iPhone while I would go for a run but after about 7 months of use, the speaker on the left side of the earphone simply stopped working. Not a good product."
4,Best earpiece headphones i ever had,"these are the greates earpieces i ever seen as far as sound and confort and ill probably never buy a diferent one, the only problem is that ive had at leat 5 they rarely last more than 8 month and its always the same problem the left speaker just quits but besides that they are awesome"
3,Underwhelming headphones,"These headphones stay on pretty well even when sweating profusely, and they have good volume. They are also inexpensive. Those are the good points. However, the sound is much too bright. The ""esses"" in songs are horribly pronounced and quite annoying. I would not buy another pair."
3,Trebly..Hiss,"As others have said, there is no bass, just a thin treble. When I use them with my exercise radio, there is quite a bit of hiss on AM stations, whereas with my cheap over the ear headphones these replaced, the hiss didn't exist. Would be nice if the plastic that went around the ears was bendable, but I don't believe it is. Only gave these a 3 stars because at $8, they're usable."
2,Didn't Fit My Ears,"I bought these because of the good reviews and because the price was great compared to what was available in my stores, but they were too big for my ears. They slipped over my ears comfortably, but were too big and fell off even before I started running. Sadly they are not adjustable in anyway. I really like the way they look, but cannot wear them."
2,Won't stay on.,"I give these 2 stars only because the sound quality isn't bad. Otherwise I'd only give one star because they WILL NOT stay on my ears even when I'm not moving. They just drop right off. I've tried to twist and bend them to fit better but they really aren't malleable and I have no success. At the recommendation of the sales associate at Target I am now trying Skullcandy earbuds which are much better, but still not the perfect solution I'm looking for."
4,Good Value,I purchased these headphones in December 2009. Nearly two years later they have crapped out. I just placed an order for the same pair so that should say something. Paying $7 every 2 years for headphones isn't that bad considering I'm a HEAVY user.
4,Good for a run,"I've been using these headphones for a few years, and they're exactly what I need. I'm not an audiophile, so I'm not going to opine on the sound except to say that I can hear music from them and it sounds comparable to what I hear on my car stereo. What makes these headphones stand out for me is that when I put them in my ears they stay there, and they're not too bulky. I can wear them around town and I don't look like silly. And when I go out for a run, I'm not worried that they're going to fall out of my ears like the standard ipod earbuds do. As a bonus, they actually go a little into the ear hole, and because of that they do block out a little more outside noise than earbuds do. The only complaint I have is that if you wear them for too long, they kind of hurt a little bit."
2,"good sound, terrible fit","These headphones have excellent sound quality, if you can get them to stay on your ears. They stay on for the most part if you are sitting still at your computer for example. When you go to exercise while wearing them, they do not stay on. The least bit of sweat makes them slide off. Very disappointing. I would keep shopping, thee are better headphones out there, there has to be."
3,Good product for good price,"Good: Decent sounds, stays on your ears during normal use.Bad: I bought these for the gym, and they stay on fine when I'm lifting weights, but on the treadmill they wiggle themselves off after a few minutes. I have tried putting the cable under my shirt, in front of me and behind my back but it never fails to slowly slip out and off my ears."
4,Some of my favorite earphones,"I'm a music junkie. I always have my iPod with me and headphones or earbuds always get a work out.I started buying these earphones about 5 years ago and buy a new pair every year or so. I know that might not make sense to some people, but I don't want to buy expensive headphones only to worry about them getting messed up or lost since they're going to be well-travelled. These work out perfectly for me because they are inexpensive, but still have pretty good sound quality. As I said, I wear mine out after about a year of heavy use. Seems like some connections start to come loose at some point because I always lose sound in one side first, but it'll come back if held just right.If you're looking for the highest quality sound, noise cancellation, or long-lasting durability, these may not be for you. If you just want a decent set of headphones for a reasonable price to last you a for a while, they're a good buy."
3,A bit awkward,"I needed to replace some old headphones and I have always had a problem with the size of many of them (ie too big for my small ear canal). So after reading the reviews I decided to buy these, particularly as the main time I listen to my MP3 is whilst running etc.I think the sound is fine, but the plugs themselves are not totally comfortable, a little awkward, also a bit awkward to put on and I feel awkward wearing them, because they are just a bit too obvious and a bit geeky. So I've decided I need to buy some other ones, so really I'd give them 2 1/2 stars because of that, but I didn't seem to have the option of using a half star on the amazon page."
2,not for running....,These are decent headphones if you don't plan to workout with these. I am a casual runner and found these extremely uncomfortable while running.
2,Your ear needs to conform to the unit's shape,"The item does not conform to your ear and it is instead the other way around. So it either fits you are not, and not adjustable. So my ear was too small for it therefore I immediately returned the item."
3,good for the money,"good headphones for the money...great for the gym they don't fall or out of your ear.I take care of the them, and they last about a year...which is better than most of other headphone of this style that I tried. I always buy a couple when I find them."
2,Headphones,I have used them approx.6 times and do not like the way they fit my ears. The sound is fine it is that they just do not conform to my ears.
1,god help my wallet,"this was the worst pair of headphones EVER! i'm not kidding. about a year ago, my mom gave me a pair of these headphones and they worked for about 6 months, and then the right ear died. i bought another pair and that pair also lasted between 5-6 months before the right ear died (again). it is exceptionally aggravating since i now have to look for a good pair of headphones that are comfortable, have excellent sound quality, and will last for a LONG time.(...). get a nice set of headphones that will last a long time."
2,Very disappointing to the mystery lover.,"What is it about the British that has so soured Truman? I have not read a book by her in which any of the British characters were nice. Here the prime nasties are all British, from the murder victim ~ the Ambassador ~ to the planner and executer of the cover-up and the people who end up giving our protagonist clues. The only Britons of any attraction are incidentals who wander in and out of the book in a page or two. Sadly, this is not my only complaint about the book: I don't like Truman's insistance on some details ~ locations, specific stores, clothing ~ which she uses to establish her credibility. Nor has she invented an even plausible plot ~ the British Ambassador to Iran knew weeks beforehand about the Ayatollah's takeover in '79, including the plan to capture the American embassy, and the only use he made of the information was to plan a smuggling operation? Please. Stick to biography."
2,Did Ms. Truman Get Tired?,"The story line was interesting, the characters were well developed, some details were fuzzy, but I enjoyed the story up until the end - but not the end. There was no denouement, it just ended right after the climax; then it skipped ahead months and became a wedding announcement. It seemed that the author just wanted to be done with it, and never tied up any of the loose ends. Bad guy shot & killed a good guy - The End. There should have been about 5 pages more to close the story. Either she was tired of the story and just wanted to be done with it early, or thought the wedding announcement would be a ""cute"" finish, but her readers deserve better. It was a very novice trick."
1,You would've thought I country bumpkin wrote this book.,"Johnson's part was hilarious. I was crying with laughter. But the rest of the book was boring, just a bunch of gossip. No juicy details. No funny lines. And definitely anti-Democrats."
2,Less than expected.,"The book was primarily gossipy and offered little that I have not heard or read before. I expected more insight and little known aspects of the presidents covered in the book than what I got. Overall, a disappointment."
5,LOVED IT!!,"This movie is funny, down to earth, quirky and just altogether great! I would recommend it to anyone!"
1,Wrong Poster,The poster sent was not the one advertised. The whole purpose of ordering the poster was to get the slogan at the top about his life being a million to one shot. Instead I received a generic looking poster with no slogan. Hoping it was just a shipping mistake and not false advertisement. Buyer beware.
3,You can do better,"IF you are in a long-distance relationship, you'll probably feel the same way I did about this book: I know as much as (or more than) this guy! Why did I pay for this book when there are much better resources about long-distance relationships?"
1,Looking for more,"My boyfriend and I are dealing with issues like money, how we should spend our weekends together (only with each other or with friends), having serious discussions over the phone instead of in person, etc. I was looking for a more in-depth book about how to deal with problems that arise in a long distance relationship. Although I did identify with some of the issues the author faced, I didn't feel that he offered many good solutions. I should have known that I would not like the book when I was skimming through it and saw how poorly it was laid out and presented. Too bad this is the only book I've found that covers this topic."
4,Good books on Quantum Gravity,"I'm a new comer to quantum gravity. Although I only have some background in classical mechanics and relativity , I thought the books is quite approachable as most of the terms are explained cearly following the logical reasioning. A side note: Besides string and loop quantum gravity, the book also mentioned differernt version of theoretical framework such as tiwster theory and Euclidean quantum gravity. Its quite disappointing that the book didn't go into detail of each theory and possibly give a comparison between different theory."
3,"Fiat 124 Sport Automotive Repair Manual, 1968-1978",The book gives ample information to renovate my Fiat. I am very happy with the info given. Just a pity that the book is made of recycle paper and that it has a soft cover.
2,not loud enough,"It won't wake you up. It has a very soft beep, and the vibration is easy to sleep through."
1,Used 2x then failed...,Appeared well made and designed but after using it on a couple occasions it suddenly failed to work. LCD was blank and swapping batteries didn't help. Very disappointing.
3,Vibrate feature didn't work,"I just received the timer in the mail today and everything worked great except for the Vibrate mode. Vibrate didn't work at all (and yes, I switched it to ON). I was very disappointed because I had been looking forward to receiving this and even paid for expedited shipping. Now I have to pay to send it back to the seller and wait for a replacement."
2,Vibrate function too loud.,I needed a silent vibrating alarm to use for waking up a meditation group. This vibrate function would be too loud to use discreetly in a quiet group setting. I bought it on the strength of so many others using it successfully for meditation. They must not mind the noise.
1,vibrate function stopped working!,Got it in Feb 08 for $9.99 from Amazon. The vibrate function stopped working after 4 months.
4,Very functional,"This timer has been very useful. We use the minutes/seconds, but you could change it to hours/minutes. Also you can have it alert you with sound, flashing light OR vibration -- pick one of the three. We also like the clip on the back so we don't have to try to remember where we set it down."
2,Would be good if it didn't keep breaking,"I wanted a timer I could use at work that wouldn't disturb my colleagues, so the vibrating alarm feature seemed just right. Unfortunately, the first one was broken out of the box (wouldn't switch between M/H and M/S mode), and now my second one has spontaneously lost its vibrating function (after the return/exchange window closed, of course). I can understand one malfunction, but after two lemons I have to conclude this is a poorly made product."
4,"Woman cruisers, share your experiences","As a female cruiser and sailing gal, I found ""Changing Course"" a useful guide. Although I seem to be in the minority, (I sought out the cruising partner,) rather than the usual - mate of the cruiser ""going along for the ride,"" I learned some valuable lessons in Debra Ann Cantrell's book. I actually read it already a year into my first voyage. Yet, the chapters on managing fear and interpersonal dynamics were especially useful. You can't take enough skills along with you. The chapter on ways to make cruising more rewarding also proved to be fun! I was excited to see just how many I had already accomplished. I'm now working on # 48, and of course, #23 is underway again!Debra, thanks for writing a useful guide for women!-Nancy Birnbaum - svsaga@pocketmail.com"
1,Not what the description says it is ...,"It brings me no joy to be so critical about a book, but I finally just stopped reading this one. This reads more like a research report or science project that about anything to do with discovering change. The book is so withdrawn from it's subjects it repeatedly calls these ladies husbands' their mates. I got through half the book only to learn it repeats itself, its data and its findings over and over again from one survey respondent to the next. If you're into research, this appears to be an incredibly well researched book (five year study), but the author fails miserably to make it interesting. If you're looking for an exciting read about new adventures in lifestyles on the water ... don't waste your money on this book. I'm really sorry I did."
4,Useful book,I liked the information included in the book and the advice of the author. Highly recommend this book to the intended audience.
4,TOO GLoooooooooooooMY,"For general, i liked this book. Yet, every single short storiesended with a death and it really disturbed me a lot. If this werenot required for my summer project, i wuld not have read it.Still, it certainly helped me in reminding the SAT vocabularies."
2,Waste of Money,Well first of all it takes me a while to put air on it. My kids did not have fun of it. The slides is nos slippery enough even there's water coming out. I used it for a week but the kids don't wan't it anymore and then connector for the hose comes of and guess what water stayed there and can't be use anymore and I was thinking I nedd a refund from this company. I hope they read this and give me my refund and then when I return it they pay for my shipping too.
4,"Love the content, not the medium","I prefer our kids to be up and about and active, but every so often (1 every two/three months) we all need them to quietly play at the computer. My kids (6 and 4)are both comfortable navigating this game and can both find success as they soak up a wide range of facts (about the planets, simple addition and subtraction, rhyming words). We could not have asked for a better edutaining product."
4,"Good, solid choice for kids","We loved Blue's Clues Preschool last year and this is a great step up in subject matter for 4-6 year olds. Great graphics, very reminiscent of the show, my kids love it and it runs great on Mac."
3,Clifford's Puppy Days,A cute story about Clifford's adventures with Emily Elizabeth while he was a tiny puppy. My picky 16 month old loves it.
5,Nice Book,Bought this for my son for Christmas. Very nice book. He had wanted it for a while now. Full of nice pics and all kinds of information. Would recommend if you are a bird lover.
2,"Horrible advertising, good movie",This movie is good for kids who are avid Thomas fans because it brings out a number of the little known or seen characters. BE AWARE THAT IT DOES NOT COME WITH MAVIS AS PICTURED. This complaint was raised to Amazon who failed to solve the problem.
4,Cool notebook mouse!,"This is a great little mouse I use with my laptop. Works quickly after plugging in, and you can add functionality to the extra buttons by downloading the Logitech software.The one thing that slightly bothers me is that the side scrolling buttons are clicked a bit easily, especially when trying to middle click the wheel. But I haven't really assigned any function to the side scrolling buttons, so it's not that big a deal.Tracking is perfect, and I have great range...from all the way across the room!"
3,Good But Has Problems,"I purchased Logitech's V320 on sale a couple of years ago. Battery life is good, but I've had periodic problems with double-clicking so I've grown accustomed to clicking very quickly. The problem is probably related to the accumulation of grime in this mouse. Periodically (~ once a year), I remove the top of the mouse to clean the area around the switches and it performs much better afterwards. Overall, the V320 isn't a bad mouse, but better options exist."
4,Cordless mouse review,I recently bought two cordless logitech V320 mice... they simply work great... and Amazon offered the best deal that I found when researching the price... Now all Logitech needs to do is come up with a reliable bluetooth mouse... or improve on the one they already have as I want a bluetooth mouse as dependable as this cordless mouse is.
3,Good mouse,This mouse was easy to set up and use. Only problem is that batteries seem to run down quickly. I've had a previous Logitech notebook mouse that ran for a very long time without battery change. I've changed batteries twice in the first few weeks with this one even though I've been careful to turn it off when not using.
1,Big Disappointment,"This book is more like the ""The New Illustrated Encyclopedia of Aircraft Manufacturers"" then the ""The New Illustrated Encyclopedia of Aircraft."" It starts with a short and somewhat sketchy history of aviation then goes into the encyclopedia which it titles ""The A-Z of the World's Aircraft."". All of the entries are just different aircraft manufacturers. It mentions a little of the companie's history and gives a list of the companies products. While there are many pictures of aircraft in the book, no information is given for any of the aircraft that are mentioned in the book. All it is a list of aircraft manufacturers and what they make or made. I was very disappointed by this book and do not recomend it to anyone."
4,Not The Real Thing But A Good Buy For Everyday Cooking,"I have several pieces of Simply Capahalon. I also have several pieces of Professional Capalon. I agree that it is not the real stuff but I am not made of money and I am not a professional cook. I use the cookware for everyday cooking and baking. I find the quality is very good for my uses. I have never had anything stick or burn in the cookware. It has been dropped but it did not been dented. If you, like me, want good cookware at a reasonable price, this is the set for you. Plus its gauranteed."
2,"Ok toaster, Space Saver","The toaster does an ok job of toasting. The controls are not well designed. The extra buttons to toast a frozen bagel seem like a good idea, but the buttons are easy to accidentally push in. The good news is that with the buttons on, the toaster doesn't start to toast, but the light for the button stays on when pushed in. The footprint of the toaster is a space saver, but this also limits the bread size to standard slices or smaller, definitely not good. Overall, there are better toasters out there with simpler designs for less."
3,"Toaster ok, not great.","Nice looking toaster, easy to clean, toasted results seem inconsistant with settings at times. Thicker slices of bread need to be manually pushed down."
1,Can't throw it far enough,"Worst kitchen appliance I have ever owned. If congress was to design a toaster, this would be it. It works when it wants to, undercooks on the first push, burnt to a crisp the second push. If somebody gives this to you, throw it away!"
3,be patient,"Toaster is a good one, but the new toasters do not have the power of the old ones, takes twice as long to make toast. The wide opening for bagels is great. The appearance is not the best, it looks more like an oven but it does the job, and hopefully will last as long as the last one."
4,Great service!,"The first time they shipped it to us, part of it was broken. We contacted them, sent it back, and they sent us a new one very quickly. We were extremely happy with the level of customer service, and would buy from them again. Thank you!"
3,you get what you payed for,"22"" TN screen is good enough for daily use, like surfing web or watching a video.Ergonomics design is the edge of this product, which affects my purchase most."
1,I returned it without even pluggin' it,"This is actually a DVD player in a big box, with 5 small speakers and a heavy subwoofer, it's not a HTIB, it's not an A/V receiver. This system has no input available whatsoever. It says somewhere in the instructions that the most you would get from a CD is a stereo sound, the Dolby digital is only for DVDs. But the biggest issue is that you cannot even put the sound from VCR/satellite/TV through it, doesn't matter it's quality..."
2,Terrible disappointment,"A little over four months ago I bought the Juiceman blender and wrote a glowing review. This re-review is most disappointing. On trying to use it, in the same manner as I have for the entire time I've owned it - to make smoothies - it simply didn't work. The display simply read ""Power Error"". Nothing made any difference. The simple fact is that the thing has broken.After finding a product that had seemed so wonderful, it's truly a disappointment to have it break down so completely..."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS BLENDER!,"I bought this blender because i wanted a powerful blender, but did not want to invest $600 in a Vitamix. I had read product reviews praising this blender. I should have listened to the one review that said not to purchase it, because the motor blew just outside the warranty period..Just outside my warranty period the lid assembly had to be replaced. Now, within 2 years of purchase the entire canister and blade assembly has to be replaced at a cost of $36.00, which i refuse to pay. The gears or bearings under the blade assembly disintegrated.This blender was very inconvenient to use. The lid assembly leaked while blending and the rubber gasket around the lid had to be removed each time to be cleaned and realigned back on...a real pain. Also, the blender is extremely loud. Earplugs anyone?The Oster blender i had previously to this one lasted over 10 years.Juiceman products are manufactured in ""Phibber Magee's Land of Crapola"". DO NOT BUY THIS BLENDER."
1,Shorted out TWICE,"I purchased this blender several months ago based on rave reviews, in order to make 3-4 ice-based smoothies per day. I followed the instructions included with the unit and after less than two months sparks flew out of the base and it died. It took the manufacturer nearly a MONTH to get me a new one, which died in less than two weeks. The manufacturer refuses to refund my money. If all you're blending is soup, it'll work fine, but why spend [price] for a ""Smoothie"" blender that can't make smoothies? I'm utterly disgusted and will never purchase another Juiceman product again. If you actually want real smoothie power, spend the money for a Vita-Mix or Blentec blender with actual customer service and serious warrenties. This blender is a huge waste of money."
1,annoying,I wasn't impressed with these workouts. They are more like a gym class at school. I had never watched The BIggest Loser didn't realize how irritating she was.
4,Ouch!,"I really like these DVDs. She makes the work-outs extremely hard, but effective. Be ready to be pushed harder than you thought you could handle. I am, personally, finding this a great way to get back in shape that fits my tight schelude."
4,"Workout Good, But Jillian Lacks Motivation","I thought the workout itself was pretty good. The moves were challenging (not as tough as Jillian makes them out to be, but still challenging). I thought Jillian was almost annoying in the video. She only does half the workout, and spends the rest of the time trying to show how tough she is by picking on the people on the tape doing the routine.I did enjoy the workout, and if you stick to it you should see results. The moves are designed to be simple yet effective. Nothing too complicated that a beginner can't master, and a more experienced person still can feel challenged."
3,"Easy, and NOT kickboxing","I ordered this DVD because i loved Jillian's six week six pack DVD. I did both workouts so it would be an hour long workout. So i was already disappointed that this DVD was only 30 minutes, and when it comes down to it its closer to twenty. Also it is WAY too easy. And not really kickboxing. You do more squats, jump-roping, and jumping jacks than any kickboxing moves. Towards the end i finally broke a sweat and was getting reved up and it was over..... But i will give it 3 stars because it is an overall okay workout. Maybe for days i need a break from my more intense practices. But it's not for someone who is looking for REAL kickboxing. i will continue to look elsewhere."
4,Awesome workout... but Jillian - not so awesome!,"I found this workout on YouTube and loved it so much, I ordered it. The workout is great! It's 30 minutes of non-stop cardio. The warm-up is even tough, consisting of plié hops, high kicks, and side kicks. Then, it's right into the workout, where you do a couple of circuits twice. The first consists of things such as side kicks, punches, front kicks, knee crosses, jumping jacks, and the like. The second is fast feet, back kicks, and uppercuts. Then, the finale is thirty jump ropes, thirty jumping jacks, and ten pushups. The workout is great, but I find Jillian and little bit too much in this DVD. She yells quite a bit, does a lot of giggling, and tries to overact. By that, I mean she tries to hard to make the workout seem tough, with the excessive panting and fussing. Like I said, the workout is fantastic... I just Jillian was more professional in this one."
5,"Great workout, see results","I know a lot of people are put off by Jillian's attitude, in my opinion that is what makes her such a good trainer, she has put in her time so I beleive she has every right to act a little full of herself, I mean LOOK AT HER.As for the workout, I have lost 25 lbs. of course that is combined with a strict diet and 100 fluid oz of water a day. There is no magic workout, I am sorry in order to lose weight you have to work out and diet, this is the best place to start, if you are a beginner, use lighter weights and work up to it. You cannot go wrong with her workouts at all!"
3,too old for this,"I actually appreciate all that she does in this video, only she tells you who to watch as a ""beginner"" and that appointed person did everything the same way everyone else did. You must have a strong healthy back to do these tapes and I don't. I also thought there was one of her dancing videos and it was not included in the set, but my 20 year old daughter, who is in amazing shape, does them and enjoys them."
2,Easier than I expected,"I am a HUGE Biggest Loser fan, so I was really expecting this to be a really difficult work out with Jillian. And she kept saying how hard this work out was and by the end of it even one of the girls doing the work out with her on the DVD was like ""That's it?!"". If you are just getting into kickboxing this would be a great video for you if you have been doing it for a while- go for something a little more challenging. I also bought Kickbox Strike Zone, but I haven't had a chance to try that one yet. I'll let you know how that one is, too. :)"
2,not worth the $,"There are several things wrong with these DVDs- 1. like other users have mentioned, the beat is off 2. the outside cover fails to mention that you need a step bench and weights 3. her banter does get a little annoying 4. and this is the biggest for me - the actual workout time is only 24 mins long! definitely not worth the $I got the one minute workout (Minna Lessig) for the same price and find it a lot more interesting.The positives - these routines will make you sweat but are not for those with weak joints as many exercises place pressure on knees/ankles (lunges, jumping jacks, jumping kicks etc)."
1,Highly Disappointed,"Love the show ""Biggest Loser"", but could barely stand to watch her DVD. Waste of money. She hardly does any of the exercises and spends more time flirting with the guys than the workout itself. Huge disppointment."
2,The Biggest Winner = A Loser,"I have many exercise tapes, but because I like Jillian Michaels I bought this set. The exercises are not organized so you end up wasting time. I don't enjoy her continual laughing and forcing her exercise team to try harder. I had hoped that since these were new tapes they wouldn't include jumping jacks and other older exercises. Since I was new I was following the easier person and sometimes she wasn't even visible until the entire exercise was OVER. Not well thought out. She spends more time talking and walking around with little explanation on how to do the exercises CORRECTLY. I was very disappointed."
1,Disappointment,"The entire video is about 30 min, the actual exercising time is about 25 and if cut out all the talking that Julian doing it will sum up for 20 min. It has basic kickboxing moves - simple side\front\back kicks and simple punches, then the usual jumping jacks, squats and rope jumps. The video will be challenging for beginners but will be fairly easy for intermediate level.Look for `Kristy's Cardio Combat' if you want a real kick butt kickboxing exercise :)"
4,The Biggest Winner DVD,Wow - this feels like Jillian is right in your living room pushing you the extra mile. I didn't realize I needed an exercise step for most of the DVD's. Otherwise this was a great buy!
1,Very disappointing !!!!! (Kickbox cardio),"I'm intermediate when it comes to working out. I love kick boxing and this video was a joke. First of all Jillian seemed like she was on dope, giggling away for no apparent reason. If you are Jillian Micheals fan then I would suggest sticking to 30 day shred. That is a great workout dvd."
3,How to Win by Losing-Shape Up Front,"I was disappointed in this purchase. I am almost 59 and not in good shape like Jillian and the persons that are working out with her. Her workout would have been better if there were some modifications to each exercise that anyone can do. To do her workout you have to be in excellent physical shape and it does not have gradual workouts to work up to a better physical shape. Also with her workouts you had to have weights, stair steps, etc. I have been working out regular with the DVD where Bob, the trainer from The Biggest Losers has different levels of physical strength and his does not take a lot of extra equipment to do the workout. You can do it right in your livingroom."
4,Love the Workout,"I absolutely love the work out. The warmups get your heart pumping and reading to go. The workouts are absolutely effective. The workouts are high intensity. Lots of jumping involved. the workouts are centered around a step, so if you don't have one you need to purchase one. The moves are complicated. I tried to start the workout before viewing the DVD. It was hard to keep up with. Watch the DVD before you workout with it. Prepare to sweat. You may want to keep water near by so that you can take a sip every now and again."
4,Worth the money,"Jillian is a great motivator. The workouts are tough, but short. I feel empowered when I am finished."
2,"Competent, but nothing special","This is pretty much the very standard Cardio kick workout. Anybody that has ever seen it done, could invent this workout on their own. The girl that is running is cute, but she brings nothing new or interesting to the workout. Also, the editing style of the video often causes the visuals to get out of sync with her count, so that if you're just watching trying to follow along, you get messed up.Don't let the name brand suck you in.. there has to be a better video out there somewhere."
2,Disapointed,"I should have looked ar the review a little closer. This only has one work out and the rest is Jullian talking. The work out is good but not that hard. She acts like it is the hardest work out ever. I have almost all of her video's, and lover her.. This was just a let down for the price."
3,Short but intense,This workout is really tough almost to tough for me but I still have about 40 pounds more to lose. The disappointment came in because in the winning by losing book she says don't even waste your time in exercising less that 30 minutes and yet this video is really short. I would have liked at least 45 minutes and possibly more direction in proper arm placement. You are also up then down and up so much i felt stressed to keep up. It is a challenge though
5,If there's one purchase I'll remember...,"If there's one purchase I'll remember in 2008, it will be my first Miele vacuum. This is by far the best money I spent this year. No regret. I've owned it for about 10 months now and I am fully pleased. The most shocking was the first time I had to change the bag and opened the canister to find the inside of the vacuum spotlessly clean, not a sign of dust. Think about the vacuums you've owned and changing their bags (I'm not even going to address the bagless nightmares.) What would it take to dare you to lick those vacuums' insides? All I can say, is that it wouldn't be much of a dare with my Miele Luna. Worth every penny. Really."
3,Not overly impressed,"I only ordered this because I was ordering something else, the primary product I was after was not sent so I would have to say never order from Beauty Encounter unless you like bad customer service, wrong products, and hassle and headache when trying to return items that were sent due to their mistake. In the past I had really liked Neutrogena poor refining products, but they had to monkey around and discontinue products. This is one of the new ones they have brought out since monkeying around with the line, but it misses the mark and I cannot really tell it is doing anything for my skin."
2,Yawn,"First two albums are unbelievable- as is Jane- but this new one just drags....and drags......and (yawn) drags.Tea for two should be Tea for 1/2. However, Cheek to cheek is GREAT- Heard Jane in concert last month in California and the quartet accompaniment is tremendous on this song- wake me up for the rest of the album-"
2,A Misstep,"Unfortunately, not the breakthrough one might have expected after the moving and well-balanced ""Come Dream With Me"". I felt the song choices didn't play to her strengths or show the emotional depth she often shows in concert."
2,Not again,"I used to be very excited about this new talent. She has a voice that never misses a note, a rarity now. I saw her perform in Boston in a small jazz club, and even spoke to her briefly after the show. Unfortunately, just her vocal chords have grown up. Her performances show her age, maybe even younger. I think she has a beautiful voice, but still lacks a certain maturity, espcially with bossanova cuts. Her heart is not there, only her voice, and in jazz, the two go hand in hand.The CD is nice enough, thanks to the incredible musicianship behind her.And a note to the first reviewer who mentioned her selling out at Tanglewood. I happened to be at that concert, and she was actually an opening act for the John Pizzarelli Trio. While her name does have a draw, more and more, she was not the reason the place of packed. I hope she gained some lessons from the completely adult and professional act that followed her. Give her 5-10 years and she will be dynamite."
2,"""Sun"" Burned","One expects an artist to grow, for each successive album to build on the last, to broaden the scope of what he or she can produce. ...How shocking then, to hear ""In the Sun""... What is most strange about this album is its lack of cohesion. ...Of course, there's some wonderful vocality on display here. ""Some Other Time,"" which others have found lugubrious is, in my mind, as good as Monheit can get. But most of the work here is merely OK; some tracks (particularly the title song -- whoever's singing with her shouldn't be) far less than that. ..."
4,This is more like it,"This album replicates a lot of material on the ""Live at the Rainbow Room"" album but is, in my mind, so much better. These are not live but studio recordings and they are first rate.These selections are mostly in the torch song tradition. There are a few happier selections to round out the collection. All are well done in terms of singing, arrangement, mix and accompaniment.I'm waiting for the next release."
5,Very well-written...,"Peter Barham shares his daugher's story of anorexia, posthumously. Debbie Barham was one of the most popular comedy writers for some very well-known performers and television spots on the BBC, among others. This book is not just an account of ""Debs'"" eating disorder, but also the strength which she portrayed throughout her illness.""The Invisible Girl"" is one father's account of what anorexia can do to a family, to friends, and subsequently-- the the sufferer herself. This book is well-written, well-organized and doesn't sugar-coat anything to make it easier to read. While we read of Debs' story, we also read of the healing process that her family must go through, upon her unexpected death at a young age.I highly recommend this book to everyone."
2,Too Intense,"I love Cathe Friedrich's Beginning Step DVD, and I became a real pro at it...so, I thought that I needed a bit more of a challenge...but STS Shock Cardio was far too intense for me. After several attempts of keeping up with this DVD, I gave up and gave it to my local library. If you live in Jackson County Oregon, you can check it out for free :)"
3,"Great printer, if you know how to fix it","When we bought this printer we noticed that it had a really low price, so we thought it might not work all that well. We hooked it up (it took about 1/2 of an hour) and it worked really well, for about a month. Then it started taking 3 and 4 peices of paper every time we printed 1 page. Solution: we would put alot of paper in it and hold down every page except 1. Then, it was stuck with about 20 documents in queue that wouldn't cancel. Solution: Go to www.hp.com/support and type in hp psc 1311. It then tells you how to cancel the documents. After all of this, the print cartrige stalled. Im on hp.com/support trying to figure out whats wrong with it as we speak. Overall, this printer is for people that can figure out how to fix it."
5,"Well,well,well is it gret or what?","No,its not just a bunch of random stuff, its a bunch of random funny stuff!! Its funny for Calvin being a little scared of Hobbes, and all that really funny stuff. Although Calvin's only a 1st grader, he sounds like he's really smart. So, I guess whoever is looking at this I have convinced them to buy it, just because it's so funny!!!!!!!"
3,Kinda lame,"This is for the actual Swirl Master toy by Curiosity Kits (now Action?). I remember how awesome these things are from when I was a kid and so I bought one to play with my niece and nephew. This is definitely easy to put together, there's nothing to it and a child could do it easily. However, the plastic ""saucer"" and splatter shield, while effective, are made of very flimsy plastic and I can see where a child might not attach them adequately to keep from painting the room. I think this is a very safe toy. I don't think any child is going to hurt his/her hand if they should touch the spinning wheel.I am planning on thinning out with water the set of paints. It's quite thick and just kind of plops onto the paper, which really doesn't let it spider out into cool designs. Also, the paper is very small---maybe 2.5"" diameter circles and 5"" squares, so it's not like you can just pop some random art paper in and use it. I think that's kind of a rip-off. Just my opinion!"
3,Lots of gratuitous violence,He is a solid writer but so much unneccessary violence and death which spoilt my excitement at finding a new author to follow.
3,crazy and brutal,"this tale just gets bloodier by the page, theres no break to mentally catch your breath its like a murder marathon. i do give the guy credit for keeping the cat, that was a nice touch. overall though not my kind of story."
5,The evolution of a hero,"Let's face it. I dowloaded this book for free and my expectation was low. I was so engrossed by page 5 that I put off going to sleep so I could read more. And more. The writing is snappy, the characters are flawed yet believable and the hero is the most fleshed out one of recent memory. I appreciate the writings of Raymond Chandler for what they were. Snapshots of a bygone era. A tough guy with smarts, so to speak. Hank, in this novel, is thrown into a life he was never meant for and evolves in a way that is completely unaticipated when his story begins. I was extremely impressed with this novel and have downloaded more to read. I need to take a break for a bit though as it is a violent, dark work and that can wear a reader down."
4,"Strong debut, but lacking great character development","In some ways a disappointment and yet an overall strong novel. Charlie Huston is a well hyped New York author with a local and national following. His East Village setting is the highlight of the book. The subtle details are dead-on (from the description of the ads in the subway to the view of the changing socioeconomics of the people living in the neighborhood).However, in a manner that is similar to Tarantino and Ritchie movies Huston produces numerous quirky and artistic minded thugs. His characters lack depth and often have difficult to reconcile motivations which is inexcusible in a book but easier to live with in a stylized movie. It is good writing but unlike Ellroy or even for the most part Elmore Leonard it lacks great characterization which is what it takes to be great."
2,If I see one more Shakespeare reference...,"The good news is that this book contains a wealth of knowledge, and you'll definitely feel like you've learned a lot upon completing it. Harold Bloom is extremely knowledgeable and has to be one of the most well-read people alive (at least as far as the Western canon is concerned).The bad news is that this book is really tough to read. Bloom often goes off into little tangents (about G.W. Bush, the collapse of modern culture, his religion, etc.) that distract from his overall message. I also found it especially annoying that he seemingly can't go more than a page without mentioning Shakespeare (however irrelevant he may be to the topic at hand) or without using the word 'daemon'. Overall, I'm glad that I read this book, but mostly I'm just glad that I've finally finished it."
1,Pound is missing...,"Where is Ezra Pound and also T.S.Eliot?How can he put Cames and forget Pound?Pound is one of the most significant poets ever and this ""critic"" forgot him?This man is a joke as critic and as a person."
2,complaint about the order,The book is a used book as expected.But worse than expected is the quality.THe cover start to detach from edge of book after I start to read it in 3 days.The original seller told me this is his own copy so there is no way to exchange for a better copy.Does it mean I get stuck withthis book?Or they can refund some $ for its poorer quality than was described?ThxRon
3,Not the commercial grade Calphalon,"People make a lot of assumptions about Calphalon cookware. If you're expecting this set to perform like the ones you find in specialty stores, you might be disappointed. If you expect to find lots of completer pieces to match this set, you might be disappointed. This is a promotional set (ignore the ""list price"" because it's fictional), and it is substabtially lighter in weight than the commercial grade Calphalon."
1,False advertising,I bought this DVD because I have a serious problem with an infestation of mockingbirds in my home. This film was no help to me whatsoever. Very disappointing.
5,Classic,Everyone should own this classic in their dvd collection. Outstanding performance by the great Gregory Peck. A timeless story that will touch the hearts of all that watch it.
5,Michelle's Amazon review,Excellent affordable price for a classic movie that is 3 to 4 times as much cost every place else! Fast delivery! Amazon is the best!
5,and he would be there when Jem waked up in the morning,"Atticus Finch is what it means to be an American. No other film has so artfully illumed the grit, and the impotence, of the decent citizen. Embayed in a community corrupted. Turning: to his children."
5,Great Movie!,"This movie was shown to my 10th grade english class upon the completion of our ""To Kill A Mockingbird"" novel unit (that goes without saying, really). Most of my class didn't enjoy the film, but me being the old movie lover that I am, I instantly fell in love with the movie. I would recommend this movie to anyone who has read the book, or who is looking to read the book. The movie did leave out several important parts of the book, but nonetheless, it is a great American classic. I highly recommend this movie to anyone, and the DVD special features are great!"
5,Classic,"this is a timeless piece I always enjoy tripping back in time , and this show does that every time I watch it."
5,A Delightful Movie,"I believe that this is a movie that suits kids of all ages. I am in my 20's and I still absolutely love this movie. I think that parents should show this movie to their kids atleast once in their lifetime so they can see first hand on what it used to be like in the world. ""Two thumbs up"" I have to say."
1,Classical,This movie is a classic that deals with human relationships in a challenging situation. It also deals with youth growing up at a dificult time. The situation challenges the status quo.
1,Overrated Movie,"I have NO idea why everyone is always talking about how moving this movie was. I saw it and it was AWFUL. I wasted a few hours of my day watching a boring, slow paced, black and white film about nothing. Scout was OBNOXIOUS!!! Her father was so boring, Jem was the only character with a personality. if you want a REAL movie about racism watch Higher Learning, Roots, or best of all Do The Right Thing. I would never reccommend this movie EVER."
4,Less than five stars for letterboxing,"This review is for the ""Collector's Edition"" of ""To Kill a Mockingbird"". The movie easily gets five stars, and the transfer on this disc is well done, but nowhere in the product description does it say ""letterboxed"" as it should. If you have an older 4x3 TV this edition is OK. If you have a newer widescreen 16x9 TV then you needTo Kill a Mockingbird (Universal Legacy Series), called ""Special Edition"" on the Universal website, for an anamorphic widescreen version. Amazon lists both as merely ""Widescreen"". Universal lists this collectors edition as widescreen, but does specify Anamorphic for the Special Edition. I usually do a bit of research before purchasing DVDs, but in this case I jumped the gun, and now I will have to pay another $20 to get the correct release for my needs. Usually these discrepancies are addressed in product reviews, but I didn't see any addressing this particular issue. IMDB.com does however correctly list this edition as letterboxed."
5,To Kill A Mockingbird,"This movie is an ""all time favorite""/ ""oldie but goodie""! Gregory Peck is fabulous in this wonderful classic. Take a good look at Boo Bradley and try to guess who plays the part. Amazing! Have enjoyed this movie since my youth."
3,Disappointing audio,Love this movie. Read the book with son #1 and decided he needed to see this classic. The video is good but the sound isn't. It went from loud (when there was music)to extremely low. At one point we had the TV volume up as high as it would go and still had trouble making out the dialogue. Bummer.
5,Should be required in schools,This movie is about accepting others differences and being happy about your own. It would be wonderful if Atticus was everyone's Father alas that is not the case. The movie is poignant and thrilling and sad. I remember watching it as a child and the rabid dog scene was so profoundly compelling but now it is really nothing at all. Great movie to watch at least once a year and explain to your kids.
3,a great disappointment in contrast to the book,"I suppose my judgment is partially swayed by the fact that I read the book first, but I was let down by the film rendition of To Kill a Mocking Bird. In fact, I couldn't even bear to watch the movie because it was totally destroying my imagined setting and characters. You just don't get a feel for the town of Maycomb, and, unlike in the book, you can't really feel anything toward the characters like anger, resentment, or love. That was probably one of the best things about the book. And the actor chosen for Dill was horrifyingly GEEKY. Too many parts left out, and it skips through the plot."
1,Universal ripped me off!,"This is a great movie, but this review concerns the packaging that the DVD comes in. Right on the cover it states that 12 reproductions of the original movie poster is included with this ""special edition."" Well, when I opened mine all I found was an empty sleaze! I was ripped off! And speaking of ripping. The cover came covered with stickers for some bizzare reason. A advertisement for other Universal DVDs was glued onto the front glue and held on with several large round stickers. When trying to remove the huge ad, the front cover art was torn off and ruined.I will be returning this DVD for a full refund, and suggest that other collectors look else where for a DVD copy of this great film."
5,To Kill A Mockingbird,"I got this and 3 other movies particularly for my ""grand"" niece so that she would be exposed to the great film classics of yesteryear. She loved every one of them. I rate this movie 5 stars!"
1,Didn't work,This DVD did not even work. I would like my money back because I was unable to use this in my Special Education classroom. I am very disappointed.
3,As good as you'll get from the 70's,"The video starts off very abruptly where you're partially into the first song. It's also like you're watching a Japanese karaoke video, where there's Japanese writing running throughout the entire performance at the bottom of the screen. The audio is very poor, mono, and the video quality is like it was dubbed from a VHS tape. But considering that it's footage from the 70's, this is probably the best you'll get if you want to see the Carpenters perform in a live genre. The video ends as abruptly as it started with no credits or anything else. The reason I gave it 3 stars, is because of the good songs. Too bad Karen's gone, because if she was still around today, she'd still be a top performer. She'd probably have a show in Las Vegas..Celine Dion together with Karen Carpenter would have been awesome."
1,Just A Bit of Garbage! (*ZERO STARS*),"I purchased a set of 8 ""Little Cirtter"" books for my son at Christmas. The first one my husband and I read to him was this book. It is a book that addresses the issue of bullies. It encourages fist-fighting to resolve a problem. I am now reluctant to read the other 7, and actually have no desire. I think I will just return them all. I am just amazed at what ""Golden Books"" will publish these days. Are they hurting for books or something! Shame on Golden Books and shame on Mercer Mayer!"
5,Bouncing Baby Boy,"This is my son's favorite place to be! He is 6 months old and loves to twirl and bounce. As soon as he got the hang of it, we couldn't stop him! We had a Fischer Price jumper for my daughter when she was younger and were unable to keep it due to safety issues from wear and tear. Would highly recommend this one!"
1,Too Low on the highest setting.,I hung this in my doorways. Even on the highest setting it is too close to the ground. My son is in the 3rd percentile for high so I'm not sure why this thing is so low. Beware if you have lower doorways. This won't work.
3,does not fit door height,this looks great however i have very tall doors throughout my house and from the top of the door frame to the floor is 9 feet. the seat is too high for the baby to touch the floor. I am wondering with baby weight increase if that will correct later. I wish someone would let me know if i am wrong and this will let out a little more i have it extended as far as it will go i do believe
2,"Baby has fun in it, but chord is too long.","Our little girl enjoys herself while in this jumper, but the chord is too long. There are no instructions on how to shorten it, and as far as we can tell, it's already as short as it can go. Her legs are already bent while just sitting in it, so when gravity pulls her further down when she's jumping in it, I get nervous that she'll bang her knee(s) on the floor."
5,Awesome!,"Length:: 0:55 MinsShe loves it! Very easy to install out of the box. Portable, and small. She sticks her hands out of the sides and bounces and so far no injuries. Great product. Oh and she's 6.5 months old."
3,too long!,"As other posters have noted, you can only shorten this jumper so much. My baby is 7 months old and is small (25 inches). We've shortened the jumper as much as it can go and even tied a knot in it, but it is still way too long. She loves it, but she can't do much jumping in it. Instead of ""the jump-up,"" we call it the ""stand around and look cute."" We're going to get another one that we can shorten enough that she can actually jump in it. I wouldn't get this version, because even if you have a smaller baby, your baby will quickly grow out of this one."
5,Great Smile Maker For Baby,"My little one loves this toy. She loves to jump, what baby doesn't. But now my arms can rest & she gets great exercise too. The only thing I would mention is the product comes w/a few toys that are designed to attach to the jumper, they are better used as just toys to play w/alone. But over all great product."
2,Great! BUT defective...,"We received this item as a baby shower gift. Now that our baby is almost 5 months, She LOVES it! The problem is she is almost too tall for it. We have a standard size doorway so it should be fine but the strap is as high as it can go and she is still too low. We just contacted Graco about this problem so hopefully they can send a replacement."
5,So much bounce!,"This is a great bouncer to have. We already had the Evenflo Rainforest Exersaucer and Bright Starts Doodle Bugs Around we Go, but I wanted an activity option that a.) incorporated bouncing and b.) was portable so that I could bring it to grandma's house for when baby needed babysitting. This is it! It is very light, and so easy to get on and off a doorway. Best of all, baby loves it. At 5 months he will bounce and spin in it for up to 30 minutes at a time.This product is very obviously high quality. I have to admit before I opened it I had been questioning if a doorway bouncer was a smart way to go. After I saw and felt it attached to the door frame I had no worries- It is very sturdy! If you don't want to spend a lot but want to own a bouncer this is the product for you!"
4,"The ideal lil jumpin swing,","I bought this for my duaghter when she was prolly around 4 months or so. PROS: I must say that I prefer the little tray and bumper gaurd because when you put your baby in a doorway, she's going to bounce in every which way. This little tray was helpful in keeping her far enough away from the door frame. We all loved this chair, although didn't care much for the little animals that hung from the side. They just kind of got in the way. It held very well to the wall, no worries ever. No injuries ever. Tons of laughs. Overall, SHE LOVED this chair. She's almost two now but I have come back to buy one for my friend. CONS... The rope is just so long. We have normal ceilings and normal height doorframes. But when she got to be a taller girl, it just wouldnt raise anymore. So I had to tie knots in the rope which may not really be recommended. but I DEFINATELY recommend :)"
3,Graco Bumper Jumper,"The Graco Bumper Jumper works well, as it clamps firmly above solidly built door casings. This is a good piece of exercise equipment for a baby who hasn't yet learned to walk. I sought this out for our new grandson, as I remembered how well it worked for our own children. Personal opinion - train that cerebellum early and often."
2,TooLong!!!,"This is a fun jumper, but it is too long. Even when I adjusted it to the shortest level possible, my daughter's legs were too low. It's like she's almost sitting on the ground. Our doors are standard, and my daughter is under 20lbs. so I don't know why it hangs so low. It would be a lot more fun for her if she sat up higher and was able to jump with the tips of her toes."
5,Fun!,"My son who is now six months really enjoys this. We needed to work on getting his legs stronger. This is really helping. He will jump in it five to ten minutes at a time. He also likes it when his big sister helps him jump or swings him a little. It is easy to use. He enjoys the toys, or you can change them out and use your own."
5,GOOD FIND,"It took me a while to decide which jumper I wanted and I am glad I went with this one. Nothing out there will be perfect but so far I have yet to find a problem with it. I Like that it is adjustable in 2 areas to accommodate a growing baby (vertical strap and the 3 straps supporting the seat are all adjustable, it takes a little time and patience) The brown trim that goes around the entire tray is a foam bumper. Should baby bump into the door jam his fingers wont get crushed. The seat is a sturdy, removable and washable material. My son is 3 1/2 months/17 lbs and loves it. At this rate I know it wont last too long but I really dont want to max out the door frames either. All and All I am quite pleased and do recommend this to others."
2,Great fun for baby but be warned,"I have a version of this jumper and used it for both of my children. My daughter loved it and had no problem with it. My son did well with it until just recently. He is 8 months old now and under the weight limit. He had dropped one of his toys that he was playing with while in the jumper. He leaned over to get it and leaned a bit too far causing the seat to turn over and he was dangling by his legs, I thought perhaps that it was because I had the seat down too low so I raised it as high as it would go and kept an eye on him. Within 10 minutes, he dropped another toy, leaned over to get it, and just about flipped the seat again (I caught him this time).I really hate to give this product a negative review because both of my kids loved it so much, but it is potentially dangerous even when used properly."
4,Great tool for keeping baby busy,I bought this one for a baby shower present because my grandson loves his jumper. Only thing is that you must have framed doorways to hang it.
5,Great product.,At first I wasn't sure what to suspect out of the Jumper of all children are different. The first time I sat my son in this he jumped and twirled it around in circles with a smile on his face. We had no problem with changing the height to the different doorways in that of our home. My son loves to rip off the toys and throw them for his older brother or father to fetch for him.
4,Fun Toy,My daughter enjoys this toy but not quite as much as I thought she would. There is nothing wrong with the toy at all - I just figured I would never be able to get her out of it because she loves to stand so much but she isn't all that interested. Still a great product to have and probably great for developing the ability to stand.
4,"HP PSC 1600 All-in-One Printer, Scanner, Copier",Good for the money but it copies way to slowly! I was surprised since I have own several of the HP all in ones.
5,Talented letter writer,"Emma Sweeney meets her father through his letters to her motherwhen he was in the U.S. Navy in the 1940s.She explains this at the beginnng of the book and the body of the book is filled with his funny and touching letters.He was such a clever writer and he had beautiful handwriting.There are plenty of men who probably feel the way he did, buthe could put it in writing. The last letter before he died seemed to be his way of saying 'goodbye'."
2,so-so,"I own this pan for over a month now and it has some kind of spots on the bottom which are impossible to clean! And when the pan is full then it's very hard to lift the pan together with food, it starts to tilt to the side and all the food can fall out! The only way i can lift this pan when its full is to have my Okra gloves on and with one hand i hold the handle and with the other hand I support the bottom of the pan! Without Okra gloves of course you risk to burn your hands! But the lid I like, no problems with that!So I would not buy this pan again!"
2,disappointed,I had a hard time with this book. It did not keep my interest at all and was hard to follow in places.
3,Revelation Explained is very good but was written at a time when Israel had not returned to its homeland,I liked the book very much but consider the book to be dated.The information was very good. There is a more current book written by Tim Lahaye.
5,Love the feel and smell of an older book,Older book which I love. Makes me feel as if the books could tell stores as well as the contents of the books material.
4,A classic for girls,Beautiful cover illustration as well as throughout the book. This is one of the great children's books and not as well known as it should be. Takes you back in time in France and makes you realize the greatest fantasy is simply that of another time in history. It is extremely complex and often avoids cliches and very much growth and healing oriented. A nice orphan's adventure. Read this - it is a lovely book.
3,Love it!!,The Rimmer looks great. i love the stainless steel. It even fits my large margarita glasses.
4,Very good but not the best,I knew very little about Wright and wanted to learn more. This book satisfied that need. She is a terrific writer. Wright led a very interesting and ecentric and difficult life. I recommend this book to anyone interested in learning more about this genius.The book I purchased is in excellent shape.
3,Frank lloyd Wright and his influence on modern architecture,"The author of this book, Ada Louise Huxtable, is a well known architectural historian, critic, and journalist.This book is a compact review of modern architecture that features a superficial portrait of FLW - his life, philosophy, theories and personality - and his influence on architecture, internationally. There are about ten poorly reproduced black and white photographs that provide inadequate illustration of the FLW style and work.This short treatment is not intended to be a serious or technical study of the great architect's work. There are other biographies and volumes for that. Huxtable handles skillfully the balance between an almost prurient coverage of the details of FLW's always erratic and sometimes tragic life with the history and analysis of the man and his work. This book is definitely a popularization of abig subject and as such appears to be be intended for the neophyte or casual reader."
5,Lost '90s Gem Of A Jam from Tami Hert!,"This is a definite must have for fans of real R&B! A mid-tempo groove & Tami's amazing vocals really set this song apart from some of the music that was released back in 1998. It's held up well over the years, and sounds like some of the new R&B being released today. Unfortunately, this CD single was the only release from Tami for North America back in '98. ""Hert So Good"", which is Tami's full album that this song appears on, was only released in Japan. Whether you go with her rare CD single or decide to go with her full album, one thing is for sure, you will have a piece of real R&B flavor for your ears to savor!"
2,Save your dough,"Despite what others have had to say, I must comment that as a climber of 10+ years, this is the worst guide book I have ever used. The maps are not to scale, the topos are unclear, there is no table of contents so it's impossible to find specific areas without paging through the entire book, bolts that are shown in the book don't even exist (not that they were chopped, the authors are just morons, leading to huge runouts!) not to mention that the book is so out of date that most routes are not even discussed. Unfortunately this is the only guidebook for this part of the sierras, thus the two star rating. In all honesty, save yourself the $100. You're better off just going to the crags and scoping out routes that look to be in your range."
4,Dark Fantasy....,"The first thing that came to my mind when writing this review is the term ""dark comedy""...well this book by Glen Cook can be considered ""dark fantasy"". Cook's book is not about fairies, trolls & princesses. There's a lot of ""R"" rated issues like murder, killing & rape here so this is not really a book for younger readers. The characters as dark and somber and the book really delves into their internal struggles and personalities. Cook's writing does a great job of bringing such character issues to light. A bit more of a meticulous read than most fantasy books; there's really not many wasted words here. I found myself having to read more carefully art the beginning to comprehend the story. But once you adjust to Cook's writing style the book flow much better after about 50 pages or so. If you enjoy books by authors like David Gemmell you'll really enjoy this book & series."
2,confusing and pointless,"This book was really confusing and I couldn't really get into it at all.It seemed like the author was trying way too hard to make it have some sort of 'gritty' feel to it, and in the end there was so much slang and jargon (considering it's the first book in the series) that a reader couldn't possibly know what the hell was going on without reading a summary of it on Wikipedia afterwards.The book was certainly unique as it had a modern feel to it despite it being a fantasy setting, but I wouldn't say it turned out well."
3,"Complex, and wekk done, but ...","I thought it was, for quite a few chapters, almost plot-less; it followed the Black Company on its travels, with no real beginning or middle to the story: it was a series of events. By the end a pattern became clearer, which I suppose means it was in fact really well done ... but I didn't find it all that enjoyable. - - Full review on my blog: [...]"
5,These Books Rock!!!!!!!!!,"The first time I read _The Black Company_, I couldn't put it down. It and its sequels are some the best fantasy books I have ever read in my life."
3,Very loose cable,This cable does do its job. It charges the camera and transfers data. Only thing is the smaller end of the cable is too loose for the camera. A slight touch of the line and it'll disconnect..it's rather annoying. It's okay for the price seeing it's very cheap.
4,Just what I needed,Product was slipped quickly. Fit my camera and helped me get my photos into computer. Was pleased to get at a reasonable price after losing my other Cable for my Olympic camera.
2,Had to return,"Appear to be well-made, although lining was coming loose in heel of one shoe. Would have kept any way, but shoes were too long in the heel and too tight in the instep."
5,Looks good and easy to install,"Perfect replacement for an old, worn, bathroom door handle. Works smoothly. No problems installing it in the existing door. Good price."
4,As expected,Couldn't find a chrome knob in any local stores. Found it here and it is good quality and operates as expected.
1,Great!,I loved this book! A just could'nt put it down! I read it over holiday break and I finished in 2 days. I also really like Kitten I think she is cute and funny! Although I was a little dissapointed when they did'nt really have the last book Wild Magic. I look forward to reading the next book in this series!
2,It was alright,It was slow paced. Not really buying the all female heroin situation. It really started out slow and stayed slow.
2,Poorly formatted Kindle edition,"This is a review of the Kindle ebook version. For a $7 download, the formatting is atrocious : lots of weird text artifacts and mis-spellings, not to mention the bad paragraph formatting with no indentations! Looks like someone uploaded a raw scan of the text with zero proofreading. That may be excusable with a copyright free novel, but not an official release from the publisher. The shook cover doesn't match the other books in the series either. Very disappointed, Simon & Schuster."
3,Spring Clamps,This review is the same as my review ot the larger clamps. They are of mediocre quality but for the price they are okay if you are not going to use them often.
2,Not clear on size,"All they say is ""Package comes with 4-pieces of 4"" spring clamps."" When I have purchased the spring clamps in the past the size was the throat opening. Not for these. The 4"" refers to their length. These are more comparable to the 2"" throat opening clamps I've purchased in the past.With that, these are still useful, though they aren't what I was expecting. Also, being that size, the price here isn't a good price as I can get 4 clamps this size from Home Depot for $4 and don't have to wait for shipment."
4,Great muddler but a bit short,I like this muddler for its muddlin' capacibilities but wish it was longer. I can't use it with my tall shakers.
4,could be a little longer,"kind of short for muddling in a strainer, i hit my knuckles on the rim, but it's still ok and does a great job. perfect size for muddling in an old fashioned glass."
4,Not Long Enough.,"While it's excellent in all other aspects, it is just too short for a usual boston style glass tumbler, or a collins glass, or a pint glass for that matter. It's good for a rocks glass but I don't do much muddling in that kind of glass.The macerating end does its job well when it can reach what you want, and I have found a use for this in crushing tomatos for bruschetta. (Saves cleanup from a food processor or blender.)"
3,"Makes good toast, but smells funny","It made good toast, and the crumb tray is great, but it just... smelled funny. My roommates and I assumed that it was just the plastic outgassing, but months later, it still smelled sketchy. We're using a different toaster now."
1,Bought this for a friend in Dec....,...and it doesnt work anymore after only 6 months. The spring doesnt hold. Purchased Dec 2011 died June 2012. Nothing agaisnt Amazon but maybe I received a defective one.
4,gets the job done.. and well,"I spent way too much time reviewing toasters. I finally settled on this one. Its basic - 2 slots, bagel option, cancel button. I was weary of an inexpenisve toaster after reading reviews about burning toast but this does exactly what it needs to at a good price. The cord placement doesnt make sense to me though. Its on the side towards the front instead of the back."
3,It's a toaster,It makes toast. A little expensive for what it is. I've had cheaper toasters just as good. I am satisfied since it saved me a trip to the store.
1,LOVE HATE THIS TOASTER,"I love the way this toaster looks on my granite counter and love the size of it. However, this toaster burns everything if it is not set on lowest settings. I have lost so much bread just testing and hoping I am wrong.Sadly, I am right everytime. When I toast it on the lowest setting sometimes it is acceptable but mostly it browns underdone or burnt. To me this is not Sunbeam quality! This is the first Sunbeam toaster I have owned that is so cheaply made. Is this Chinese quality? Where is it made?"
2,Would never buy again....,Would never buy again....fine foe the RV...but nothing special I have a much better Bodium and would never buy this again....very walmart like toaster!...fine for an apartment or RV...I guess!
5,Sidesplittingly funny,"O'Rourke seems to cut through the tourist brochure witha chainsaw as he visits various troubled places around the world.Most entertaining and enlightening, highly recommended."
1,Too Small,The grips were not long enough to go around the handles of a standard walker. What is going on here? They did take them back and refunded our money.....thank you.
2,where is the sound,How do I get robin Williams to read this?I do not see anywhere to have it read to me. I have the volume all the way up.
2,good product but the container problematic,Not sure if there is a secret (on how to use the container) that I don't know about but no matter on which side I place the bottle it kept leaking until I lost the whole thing: I was barely able to use it. (apparently you could use the container from both sides & that was problematic for me).
4,"Not the best movie ever, but one of the funniest!","this movie generates lots of laughs when a ""happy drug"" traps people in their best memory forever. The plot's a little choppy, and a bit slow in parts, and it's certainly not for the easily offended, but the whole movie's worth repeated viewing when Scott Thompson's character comes out of the closet in a prolonged musical number. Or when Bruce McCulloch's depressed rock star turns into an Osmond-wannabe. Yes, Brendan Fraser's in a cameo appearance, but the Kids are the real stars. Definitely worth owning."
2,The Kids drop the ball,"Don't get me wrong--I love the Kids in the Hall. My wife and I never miss them on Comedy Central. We have tickets to see them in LA on their 2002 tour. However, I was amazed that they produced such a dull film. The premise, a new drug that makes the taker deliriously happy, would have made for a funny skit, but here it is inflated to a length that cannot be sustained. The Kids' forte is sketch comedy; they are every bit as good as Monty Python or the better SNL casts. I wish they had played to their strength here and done something more along the lines of ""The Meaning of Life"" or ""And Now for Something Completely Different,"" Monty Python's classic big screen collections of hilarious skits. I hope they get another chance to do it right."
5,the kids the the hall - brain candy,"what can i say, undeniably the best film i have seen in a very long time. for anyone unfamiliar with TKITH might find the beginning a little confusing as there are so many different characters being established and played by all five members of TKITH,(often each member plays at least 3 characters). once into the main film it is easy and hysterically funny to follow. Kevin mcdonald is at his best as the scientist (look out for his guest appearance on a talk show!!!!!!). Bruce mcculloch once again makes an attractive blonde, scott thompson does what he does best, mark mckinney is brilliant as the ""stummies"" inventor and not forgetting dave foley as the put upon assistant. pure comedy genius and seriously under rated. a must have for KITH fans everywhere!"
2,not all that,"I love kids in the hall, but this movie is not going to get a sequel. They stretched a skit to fill a movie, and it just ended up feeling thin. It just wasn't that funny. I think I laughed outloud when the german model said ""folk art"" and that was it. It's humorous of course, just no where near as hysterical as some of the episodes. I would have MUCH rather seen a compilation or ""best-of"" from the television episodes. They'll always be priceless, and I'm sure the next time we'll get it."
1,Died after a few months,"I also purchased this product thinking it'd be a great low-priced scale. I consider myself to be gentle on my kitchen appliances and though I use it once a day or once every other day, I expect it to last more than a few months. I changed the battery, re-checked the connection, and it's shot. I was always skeptical about its accuracy but now it's just dead. I'd recommend other brands unless you want to have to replace yours in less than a year."
1,Not working out-of-box,"The scale does not come with a battery, even though there is a distinct place for it in the internal packaging. Scale had a 2002 manufacture date on it. All of this I can live with, the bigger problem was that the scale would not zero itself. When turned on, it would drift dramatically after a couple of seconds. I timed it -40g for one minute (and after hours... just keep on going...). The box had no signs of damage, so I'm guessing the load cell was bad. Very disappointing."
5,Wonderful armchair travel book!,"I have just read Helen Bergan's book, Climbing Kilamanjaro....it is wonderful and I highly recommend it to you! It is a fascinating travel odessy of a young woman traveling home to the US from Ethopia in the 60s. Her observations are both informative and amusing, her stories great, and as an added bonus, the book is peppered with tasty recipes of things she mentions throughout the text. Don't expect this to be a sniveling book on travel with a disability, it is not! Her mention of her crutches appears at times when it is appropriate and had a bearing on her actions. She, like the majority of us, lived her life as she saw fit and to the fullest with an occasional acknowledgement of her limitations. She put me to mind of John Hockenberry and his Moving Violations...what they were doing is simply fascinating, disability or not. If you're looking for a great trip to Africa the easy way, get this book and read it."
3,Bad but good,Good advice interspersed with Newage (rhymes with 'sewage') drivel; your job: tell them apart. Nice pictures of the author nekkid tip the balance.
5,They've managed to do it again.,"Once again 311 has changed they're style. It seems every CD of theirs has a different rhythm.I like Transistor for the most part but I think it could have been a little more upbeat and less slow tunes.I love this band and if your a fan of reggae or a fan of the bands don't pass this title up.If your looking for something more upbeat try 311-Music,punk 311-Grassroots,alternative 311-311.Try this CD for a new experience in music."
2,Broken after 2 years and 2 months,"I love the flavor, taste and everything about the way the machine should work, however after 1 year the basket hold feature broke. This means I could not set the wake up timer and use the grind and brew setting. It also means that I had to hold the basket under the grinder every time I make coffee!That was last year.I called Capresso about their $200 coffee maker and they told me to buy a new one because it was out of warranty!!!At the 2 year 2 month mark the heating and pumping element broke. Now I have a $200 coffee maker that only grinds!Made great coffee, but over priced and UNDER ENGINEERED!"
1,Believe those negative reviews,"Had the Capresso for two days and returned it. I should have listened to the reviewers who said it doesn't make a hot cup of coffee. They were absolutely correct. I am not one who needs a burning cup of coffee but one that in summer does not start out much above body temperature and when you add milk, goes down to downright lukewarm. I am discouraged by all the grind and brew pots having tried both the Cuisinart and Melitta. Neither one of those could make a decent cup of coffee unless you liked it so weak that it was almost clear. The Capresso makes a just ok cup and is not worth the 199 dollars for a warm ok cup of coffee."
2,"Great product at first, but auto. grinder broke after 3 mos.","It still makes coffee and still grinds coffee beans. However, I purchased the coffee maker because of its ""automatic"" coffee grinder/maker feature, which broke after a few months. The salesperson warned me, but I did not heed her warning."
2,Great idea if it worked,"Knowing my passion for good coffee, my wife got me a Capreeso 453 for our anniversary. I'm the only coffee drinker in the house so I tend to make small pots. Within a few months after getting the 453, I noticed that the grind times were very erratic. In the 2-4 cup mode the grind would run from 3-25 seconds, making either very strong or very weak coffee. I reported the problem to customer service, and the unit was repaired and returned in 4 days. (great service). Unfortunately the problem reoccurred within a week. Then Capresso sent me a new unit. I programed it to make 4 cup strong coffee, filled the grinder and fired it up. It proceeded to grind all the coffee in the grinder, enough for about 12 cups. I now use the unit manually and only put as many beans in the container as I need, and grind them all."
2,eh...,"this coffee maker worked fine for a while and it brewed fine coffee. The grinder broke within a couple of months. The carafe is shaped in such a way as to promote down-the-spout dribbling; very annoying when a clean pour is the only goal of the carafe. I would not recommend the Capresso. The only redeeming quality about this coffee maker is that it still made coffee when my Bodum coffee maker broke (chip failure). For the love of Pete, why can't they just make a good looking coffee maker that works?"
1,Worst Coffee Maker I Ever Owned,"This was the most expensive -- and the worst -- coffee maker I ever owned. Even on the strongest settings, with the darkest French roast, brewed coffee was weak. It was difficult to get the filter basket in place. And it took an enormous space on the counter. My 17-year old Thoshiba grind and brew was far superior. That unfortunately, died of old age and I could not find a new one. I have since returned the Capresso."
3,Great while it worked,"My husband surprised me with this grinder-coffee maker combo and I was delighted with it until it just stopped working after 7 months. It was a bit loud, but made great coffee. Unfortunately the cost of getting it repaired was almost as much as the coffee maker, so I went back to my old reliable Krups unit."
2,Disappointed!,"I have wanted a Capresso machine for years. I finally splurged and bought one. The first one I received leaked and filled my counter with water the first night. The second one has no defects - but we can't grind flavored coffee (it gets caught in the shoot) and the filter basket frequently clogs, either causing the no drip not to work (it gets stuck open), or the basket to fill up with water (it gets stuck closed). The gold mesh coffee filter (supposed to eliminate paper filters) allows a fine dusting of grounds to get to the coffee. When I went to replace the water filters at capresso.com, they are out of stock! Overall, I wish I had bought a less expensive Cuisinart and saved money!"
3,Canon Copier PC 170,I ordered a canon E20 cartridge at the same time. The copies are very light and I have the copier set to max dark... I don't know whether the problem is the cartrige or the copier
3,"Good Price, Mediocre Operation","A sharp looking machine that soon disappoints. The low price lures you in...and then the troubles begin. Hence, after only two years my Canon personal copier has stopped working due to an apparent short in the ""copy"" button. This is the second time I have had to purchase a new desktop copier due to problems with this model of Canon machine...so, in the long run, am I really saving money? Not to mention the cost of printing cartridges, which average over 100.00 each! The copies are fair in quality, though certainly could be darker. On the positive side, when this machine works it is easy to use and makes little noise. Overall, though, this Canon product is a dubious proposition."
4,Good for basic home copier! Nothing fancy!,"This is a good little functioning copier, adequate for the occasional copy of two at home. It does black and white copies and has adjustable darkness switch. Just don't expect anything fancy on this copier. It does its job, but nothing above the basic stuff. Would I recommend it? Yes, but only if you can get a good deal on it. I got it for free as a reward. I much prefer my 10 year old Canon copier this one replaced."
1,Very Dissapointed,"Very unhappy with product, slow, bulky, goes through Toner extremely fast.I had a Canon Copier for years.It was amazing.The power supply, went and I decided to buy another Canon.Boy, was this a mistake.It is nothing like the original."
2,Not for copying pages from books,"This is a cleverly designed compact copier, but don't buy it if you think you would ever need to copy a page from a book. In order to copy a page from a book one must push down on the book to flatten out the part of the page closest to the spine, and this copier would probably break under that kind of pressure. In addition, the surface (platen, I think they call it) where one places the book to be copied moves back and forth during the copying process, and even if one doesn't push down on the book, a considerable amount of patience and manual dexterity is needed to hold the book perfectly on the surface while it moves. We immediately saw that we would not be able to use this copier, since we occasionally need to copy pages from books, and Amazon was very nice about taking it back even though we had already begun to use the toner cartridge. Amazon even paid the shipping charges to return it."
4,great little copier,"I use this instead of my scanner and ink jet and am very impressed with it. I wasn't expecting much for the price ($24 after rebates) but it surprised me with how well it works. It starts up within seconds and shuts down automatically. This is not something you would use for a business, it copies slow and does not feed multiple documents. It is nice and portable and is perfect for coping a few pages every week."
3,OK deal,"This copier works clean, clear and fast for home use. My complaint is that it comes with a ""starter"" cartridge (not listed in product information page). As I understand it, the starter cartridge is good for about 1,000 copies whereas the regular one is good for 2000 copies. So it makes my cost 'per copy' 7.2 cents instead of the 3.6 cents it would have been had it come with the regular cartridge. It did not state that it comes with the ""starter"" cartridge in the listing and I think that is a bit of a ""rip-off""."
1,Life-Span Less Than One Year,"The thin plastic seat cracked in less than a year of use and I am well below the advertised capacity of 300 pounds. Thinking this was an anomaly, I purchased a second one. The seat on this one cracked too, in exactly the same spot, in only 7 months! If I had to guess, this is an intentional manufacturing deficiency."
1,No jasmine scent at all!,This product has a very strong vanilla smell and no jasmine at all. The lotion is also a bit watery. I was disappointed.
3,Last Waltz,"It was nice to find this VHS, which my husband had been looking for, and the price was right. However, it took a couple of weeks to arrive, which seems excessive for an easy-to-ship package."
5,Now THIS is music!!!!,"The Band is the greatest musical group ever and this movie proves it. They play their own great songs with perfection and back up almost ever genre of music (blues,country,rock,bluegrass,etc..) even better than their own. The music is just amazing and so are the stories."
5,Phenominal Movie,"I love this movie o Death. THe band SI my Favorite Group. It is such a Shame That Robbie and Martin have and will make money from his and the other members never saw a diem frome the movie. Y just show robbie's Name there R other member alot more talanted. I will buy thi smovie and watch it rembering the lives of Rick Danko, and Richard Manual (who has the best inerview parts of the movie) THis is A great movie and it celebrates a Great Band"
3,The Last Waltz,Good dvd. I have enjoyed this video recording of The Band and the other stars. I would recommend this video because of its lasting affect.
5,The Last Waltz,"Hailed as the greatest concert movie ever, it just may be. Robbie Robertson, the film's producer and guiding light behind The Band, is charismatic off-stage, electric on-stage. All the guest musicians sing and play at the top of their games. Highlights include Joni Mitchell's ""Coyote"", Waters's earthy, soulful ""Mannish Boy"", Dr. John's dreamy ""Such A Night"", and Clapton's jaw-dropping guitar work on ""Further On Up The Road"". Scorsese hired top directors of photography to film this event from every conceivable angle, and the result is an intimate, exhilarating ride into the heart of rock music."
2,Slow and Plodding,"Granted it is difficult to take old footage and successfully wrap it in today's DVD technology. I give the producers credit for having done a good job with what they had to work with. I found the performances enjoyable insofar as they were passionate and did a good job of capturing the era. I found the simplistic format of performance, simple interview, performance, simple interview.... to be boring. Some of the spoken audio was poorly captured and hard to understand. It succeeded as a documentary (documenting an event) like a single camera stuck on a tripod at the back of a church could be said to document a wedding. The performances are truly left to stand on their own as the filmmaking itself was lifeless. As another reviewer commented, this soundtrack would prove a decent music CD. It was fun seeing old footage of Robbie Robertson, Bob Dylan and the others. But to rate this 5 stars is a big stretch."
5,PERFECT!!,My husband bought me this journal for our first anniversary as we just found out we were expecting. I have only filled out a couple of pages because I had to stop myself or I would have filled in allsorts of things... Such unique ideas for thoughts to share and record. I would definitley recommed this book.... Cant wait to finish it and share it
5,Perfect,I just received my Expecting You Journal and I absolutely love it. I can't wait to write in it.
4,Gets the job done,"Dough one could of course have wished for better paper quality etc., it doesn't really matter. They'll easily take the kind of abuse which results from ordinary use; and, besides, you shouldn't really care how the cards look once you're through with them anyway: their purpose is simply to allow you to increase your Latin vocabulary - not to become heirlooms."
4,"""Good to know"" info older motorcycles","I found this book at a local library, and I've actually thought about ""loosing it"", but in the end I'll stay honest and try and find my own copy.This is a collection of illustrated practical hints and tips for the motorcyclist based on material that first appeared in the British ""Motor Cycle"" magazine during the period 1908 to 1961.It has a lot of ""good to know"" information for those who own older (before 1970-ish) motorcycles (particularly British bikes). However,, it'd be a nice reference book to keep in the garage... If I could ever find a copy."
2,Could be a lot better,"Having purchased other Princeton Review books, I was dissapointed with this book. Not enough of the book was dedicated to examples, and it lacked practice tests. 2 critical things missing considering the price of this book.I liked that their word lists are composed of the words most common ones on the SAT, but I didn't like the way the words were arranged. Words that didn't really relate seemed to be thrown together into a list.The vocab cards seem like a plus, but they put 2 words into a card.Overall, this book isn't worth the money. It skimps over the basic necessities that a SAT verbal book should have."
2,Nicks and scratches AVOID,"I had an 8802 which worked flawlessly and I loved it however it broke and this one had decent reviews so i gave it a try.After several attempts at both dry and wet shaving, cream, no cream etc.. it missed the hair on my neck but repeatedly managed to give me nicks and cuts around the corners of my mouth and upper lip. I got a return authorization from Amazon so I hope to get another 8802 instead.This is an older model 8043 avoid it like the plague!!!"
3,Panasonic Shaver Only Fair,I've used Panasonic shavers for years. This new one is not as good as my old one but better than the alternative brands like Braun and Norelco. It is cheaper in construction and poorer in design than my previous Panasonic. I'm disappointed that Panasonic cuts corners to save pennies.
2,Good for the shower,"I've always shaved with a rotary shaver. This foil shaver works okay in the shower (wet) but is pretty useless dry. I still find myself finishing my shave with my old rotary (Norelco). I bought this one based on the positive reviews it received. Everyone's beard is different, so buying any electric razor is a bit of a gamble (IMHO). I gambled and lost on this one."
4,Pretty great electric razor,"Pros: works for face and head. That's right, if you are one of the many emerging head shavers, I would suggest this one. Works both wet and dry. I usually slap on some shaving gel before I shave. It is easy as all get out to clean.Cons: unfortunately, it doesn't work for crap on my neck. It either chews it up like cheap hamburger (back of the neck), or can't give a smooth shave (under the chin). So, i use a regular razor for the neck.Overall, its a pretty great electric razor. Use and maintenance make it a worthwhile addition to my morning routine."
1,Overpriced cheap plastic crap,"After spending over $80, what I got was a flimsy cheap plastic Chinese-made crap. It makes a very annoying high-pitched noise, and the power plug is proprietary, means you have to pay extra and buy from Panasonic if you ever lose it.I should've just spent $40 and get a Remington."
4,"Good in things, not so much as a plain snack","These aren't really good to eat straight out of the bag - cranberries can be a little bitter. But these are great IN things, like oatmeal and muffins where the bitterness morphs into a refreshing tartness. I suspect you could make regular cranberry sauce for Thanksgiving with these plus some sugar, but I haven't tried that yet. I even put a couple berries in my tea for a little extra flavor. The hot water releases the flavor with a little juice and it tastes great.Freeze dried fruit tends to get a little powdery, but there's no powder at the bottom of the bag I received. These store very well. I suspect they would keep for a long time, but I plan on eating them all before they could possibly expire."
4,A timeless snapshot of the classical guitar sound.,"Two disk set, entitled ""Spanish Guitar Classics"", contains 40 tracks. 14 by Andre Segovia, 13 by Carlos Montoya and 13 by Paco Di Lucia. Unfortunately, there is no write up on the songs. The sound clarity however is as good as I've heard for these classics."
1,Terribly short and misleading,"This book was used in my Computer Science class. I'm glad that I already knew HTML prior to this because it teaches you nothing. Online tutorials have way more information than this book. It's very short. Sure, it covers some topics... but it makes you believe that you cover a world's worth of JavaScript in 3 chapters. That barely scratches the surface. The HTML part isn't too bad, but could've been improved.By the way, one will not learn anything similar to the snippets of code on the cover. They're placed there to make you seem like you're learning a lot."
2,Too tiny to see!,"This is a VERY tiny dictionary, which makes it very difficult to read. It also is geared toward British English, which further limits its usefulness for American readers. It is compact and plastic bound, which does make it a true ""pocket sized"" book, but if you are looking for readability and overall usefulness, I would look a bit further."
4,"You can copy a dual disc, ONCE","On the audio stereo side of a dualdisc , I 've never had a problem copying a song to put it on my personal CD's. You can't copy the 5.1 or DVD video but the stereo is there for you to take. Its a great format and it seems SACD and DVD-Audio aren't catching on as one wants the Dual disc offers the best of both worlds .This recording has been released in every format so that tells you something ?? Right ?"
5,My review on Joyce Bova,"I would highly recommend this book to anyone interested in hearing the story from a woman who truly loved Elvis- I found myself completing this book in 3 days. It has been one of the best books that I have read regarding Elvis as a person. If I was able to say anything to Ms. Bova it would be ""thank you"" for allowing a fan like myself to get to know how Elvis was on a more personal level. I admire your strenght and think you were a very special and memorable piece in the complex life that was Elvis Presley."
3,mas o menos,"Si bien el coro es de un buen nivel, la verdad es que el sonido no es como yo esperaba, y algunas interpretaciones están un poco apresuradas y con poco fraseo."
1,elf brushes,"I have a great big living area. I must dust it all. Top of windows, picture frames, what nots, and on and on. I tied my swifter duster to a broom handle to reach the difficult places. It kept coming apart. I keep waiting for you to realize that you are asking hundreds of thousands of people to spend an entire day with a little stick, with a little duster on the end, to go on and be happy. I've a notion to write a song about it. In the meantime, I want a great big fat swifter duster, with an extension rod, for dusting big fat tall places. It should be at least two feet in circumfrance. Better yet, make that bigger. If you can't provide the extension rod, just make the handle very sturdy, so that I can rig one. I am a 71 year old kid, and swifter duster makes me smile. Barbara G. Vernon My address is 1955 braeburn dr,. Salem, Va 24153"
2,hyped - up nonsense,"I know when watching a movie one must suspend a certain amount of disbelief, but this one just didn't hold water for me ( pun intended ). Too much just didn't add up, and the ending is silly. All I can say is I would never have paid to see this film, I saw it as a freebie showing on one of the channels of a cruise I just went on ( how ironic is THAT?!?) It's not scary, and it's just not that good."
1,Dreadful,"Cheap,dreadful, and painful! I am really thinking about asking for a refund for this rental! Just horrible! I can never get those hours of my life back!"
2,Disappointing,"When I first bought the DVD, the cover said based on true events. The only thing that was true about it was that theywere left behind. All the rest was fictional, since there was no way of finding out what actually happened in the water. Plus, I think the nudity was gratuitous. There was absolutely no reason for it whatsoever. It didn't add to the story. Just to see them laying in bed naked??? Give me a break! I thinkit was just thrown in hoping the movie will sell better. I thought it was exciting in parts but then realized that it was all fictionalized. I expected more from a story that was supposedly based on 'actual events' the only 'actual' thing was that they were left behind."
1,open slauter,"this movie was pathetic. my best friend's mom reccomended it and we gave it a shot.IT STUNK!!!! basicly, all it is is two people floating around talking.there is no suspense.the acting is horrendous.and the ending was stupid and disturbing.when they see this big tanker ship,why dont they swim to it. overall, this movie is a waste."
1,Don't even think of wasting your time and your $$$$,3/4 of the movie was just 2 people stuck out in the ocean???Overall: It's sad that this actually happens.
1,Under no circumstances should you watch this movie,"Many reviews involve a plot synopsis of the movie. I will give you something of an unorthodox one. Rather than tell you the movie's premise, I will tell you what you can expect out of the movie.Two badly-acted people bobbing in the ocean for an hour and a half. Nothing happens. Occasionally there are sharks.There is nothing scary, nothing tense, nothing worth watching. it's jsut watching two very badly acted people bob in the water. it is possibly the most boring film you will ever see, as a grand total of nothing happens in the course of the movie.Avoid at all costs."
1,How to screw up a good story,"It could have been terrifying, full of suspense, tension, etc.And it resulted to be boring, and more... You watch the whole movie EXPECTING for something to happen: the action vanishes, the dialogues never get to THE POINT of being lost in the ocean, having a lot of things to say BEFORE TO DIE! And the ending is a subject itself: incredible, weak, empty, too stupid even for this movie. Please, don't waste your time."
1,The worse movie ever!,The people that compared it to Jaws was deeply wrong. This was the most horrable movie ever. I would not recommend anyone to buy this movie.
1,Open Water,"I wish I had read the reviews here instead of going by the media hype and spending good money on it. This is one of the worst movies I've seen in a very long time. Another that goes in the ""trade it back in"" stack. Save your money. The one thing I have learned from this movie is to rent first before buying."
3,"a lot of potential, but falls short of expectations","Open Water is one of the more difficult films that I've tried to review. On the one hand I appreciate the producers' ability to create a decent film on such a low budget. I also liked the fact that we're not watching some recycled actors. It was refreshing to see some new faces in Blanchard Ryan and Daniel Travis. Unfortunately, the film left me feeling someone empty. The land scenes seemed somewhat gratuitous. The producer should have used these few scenes to develop the characters a little more. For example, what was the point of the bedroom scene? As for the open water scenes where the majority of the film takes place, they were well done. Were they as scary as Jaws or as terrifying as reviews have made them out to be? I'd say no. They were a little too predictable. Overall, I'd say this film is worth watching, but I would recommend renting, buying used on Amazon, or waiting for it to come out on cable."
2,Difficult to rate,"I found this movie interesting. I can't call it entertaining. It's not scary. I guess it could be classified suspenseful. But the suspense wasn't enough to carry the film. Was ready to give this film a 1, but decided that it was typical of a low budget, independent film and has a certain strange appeal. It kept reminding me of those ""I Shouldn't be Alive"" shows on Discovery."
1,Thank god for the FF button!!!,"Action: ZeroSuspense: ZeroTerror: ZeroAnnoyance: Maxed outGive me a break! This is one of the worst acted, lowest production level, poorest written movies I have ever seen!The DVD extras are better than the movie, and ther are pretty bad as well! Save your money!Look, I was a Scuba instructor for almost 18 years ant certifice thousands of students. We all knew the horror stories out of Cozumel, with dive charters forgetting divers.1) Any popular reef has several dive chatrers per day. At least three more boats would have been along.2) Who would just sit there??? It's an exercise in survival of the fittest, or thinning of the gene pool. These bozo's were better off as shark chum."
1,I Really Think Not,"Well...if I went to the movie theatres to see this movie, it would have been cheaper. Luckily I only dished out 8 dollars or so for this movie and for me, it is one of those movies you can really only watch once. No serious spoilers here. A married couple goes scuba diving with a group and they are left behind and straded in the water. They end up having some bickers between them. Really, after listening to the wife constantly moan and whine, I was rooting for her to be ended. Others may find some annoyance in the dialogue throughout this movie. The acting was done much better by the husband than the wife. The picture wasn't all that great, but this was a small budget film. The concept may be comparable (and there are many comparisons)to the Blair Witch Project, but the Blair Witch project wins by a long shot."
3,Kinda Liked It,"A couple takes a boat vacation into the ocean. The tour guide miscounts, leaving them stranded in the middle of the ocean. Sharks appear in the water. Over the next day they must stay afloat. Kind of disturbing, it is implied they both were eaten alive by sharks at the end. Not a bad choice for a rental."
2,Boring!!!,"I thought, going into this movie, it would be something like Jaws or even Deep Blue Sea. I had not read previous reviews or even heard from friends what it was like. I had not idea. This movie was, without a doubt, one of the dumbest shark movies I have ever seen. You spend a good hour floating in the water with two lost scuba divers left by their scuba explorer club. From minor jellyfish stings, to nips of wandering tiny sharks, the movie lets down in more ways than one. Not to mention that the movie seemed to be directed by a guy with a hand-held camera. The directing was bad, the producing was bad, the storyline was all together bad. Rent Jaws again. You'll enjoy yourself more. If you are expecting a freaky shark attack that might very well keep you from wandering in the deep blue, this isn't the movie for you..."
1,Horrible Movie,"This hardly even deserves one star. This movie is full of bad acting, bad directing, bad sound quality...it was just terrible. It was boring and poorly done, just 80 minutes of nothing leading up to an ending that evokes the worst feeling in the pit of your stomach. While I feel for the couple that had to endure such a horrific experience, this movie was not worth seeing. It was just an exploitation of a sad, sad event that should have been left alone."
1,this movie sucked,"this movie was the worst movie i've ever seen,i only gave it on star b/c of the semi good nude scene in it,i liked blair witch project more then this movie and i hated that movie"
2,"Scary situation, but no suspense or entertainment value!!","Okay, a good idea, lets take a horrifying news story and put it in production for a film. The movie is not horrible, its just dreadful to watch. I can see where the director was going with a realistic point of view, but it just was not well put together and I was looking at my watch wondering how much longer is this thing going to go on. How would you feel if you were in this situation being stuck in the ocean with no one around, jellyfish stinging you, sharks circling you, no food, cramps from staying a float, and over 12 hours of torment? Not good and not fun to watch either. Jaws is a much more entertaining movie, and has all the elements that will scare you while swimming in a pool. This movie lacks the thrills, is boring and is like watching a reflection of a bad vacation become worse!!! Don't waste your money!"
5,I've found another star!,It was my first Charlie Huston novel. And it was the most exhilrating read that I have ever experienced. That's not a typo. I meant to say read! I'm looking forward to my next RIDE with Charlie Huston. The guy's a Superstar!
3,disturbing as hell,"Wow! I loved the other 2 books, but this one is too disturbing and illogical. Why the heck did he come back to see his parents?Why did he send his money back to the US? Why did he kill his friend? ( granted he just swallowed a bunch of narcotic, but what the heck!). I no longer like the main character. I hope Mr. Huston make this guy a little more likable in A Dangerous Man."
3,"Better than Cormac McCarthy's new one, but still....","I read this yesterday and was mildly entertained. I liked the beginning, but felt that the book kind of fell apart as Hank went through people like paper towels...not usually his fault, technically, but still became redundant. I guess I was hoping for more of a ""conclusion"", yet that's probably asking too much for what is clearly just a book in a whole series...definitely leaves it open for the next one, but I just didn't find that satisfying ending I was looking for. It just seemd obvious and trite, and hardly worth the payoff for reading the whole book. That said, I think Huston has the potential to be great, just maybe not with this series."
5,What a Find!,I first heard this poem on the Smother Brothers Show many years ago. Then found a framed print of it in a thrift store. Now I knew who wrote it. This poem has never left my mind so when I saw this book I had to have it. If you lived through the 60's & 70's you can relate. If not than your teachers are not teaching history as it happened. Love this book.
2,They at Capitol did the wrong thing!,"I was happy, finding this CD in a shop in Singapoore. And I was happy, when I opened it and found the Rainbow- Label Capitol used in the late fifties and early sixties. The shock came, when I played it: instead of the full Stereo- Sound I heard a meagre Mono- CD. My English Regal LP or the American abridged reissue on a bad Vinyl pressing sounded much better. Didn't they know, that they have a Stereo Master, or were they unable to find it. The CD is now out of print and I hope, in the meantime they had enough time to find the Stereo Master for the next reissue, and I hope, it will be soon, or Mr.Ray Purslow from the Recordcenter in Birmingham UK should do it!"
4,Delivers with the Punch of a Machine Gun!,"The definitive biography of ""Scarface Al"" Capone, who ruled the Chicago underworld with an iron fist during Prohibition. John Kobler is a fine writer whose flair with words will keep his readers glued to the pages, regardless of the subject matter. In ""Capone,"" he masterfully recounts the rise and fall of the Windy City's overlord of vice and crime as only he can, presented in an honest, objective, and straightforward (but never dull) manner. This is a highly entertaining effort which any crime historian is sure to enjoy. My only regret is that Mr. Kobler didn't tackle the biographies of other gangland luminaries as well (although he did an excellent job narrating the history of Prohibition in ""Ardent Spirits""). If you must read just one book about Big Al, then this is the one. As far as I'm concerned, you can skip all the others."
2,"Easy read, but some stuff outdated","I am a natural health devotee and though I agree with a good part of the material the author discusses, I found a few items that are outdated and irrelevant. I have other resources that are much better than this one and more up-to-date"
2,Too old and yellow to give as a gift,"I bought this thinking I would give it to my granddaughter at Christmas, but it was so yellow(from age), I couldn't give it to her."
4,Color Choice,I found it very interesting and helpful in mixing colors just wish I'd had it when I first started painting
5,Color Choices ...by S Quiller,"Excellent resource for teachers and people in the arts. Great lessons - practical, professional. Recommend this book. Use it all the time."
1,The End Of Days According to Wikipedia and Fox News,"Why do the producers feel compelled to cloak their evangelism as an objective documentary?Because take away the excellent History Channel production values and narration you're left with Jim Bakker pointing to a map prophesying something bad will happen in the Middle East.The closing credits cite the documentary's sources including Wikipedia.org, FoxNews.com and CNN.com."
1,Garbage!,"Garbage. The commentators were boring, non factually oriented and really in many ways seemed uneducated and devoid of higher intelligence. This is complete propoganda, and I'm shocked it gets any decent reviews..... I mean it's not even very well done propoganda. If you've seen documentaries with sweeping landscapes, riveting narratives and thought provoking themes...... you should go watch them again, because this has absolutely none of that. This is poorly constructed propoganda film.... the jews are great.... I love the jews...... the jews founded everything..... the jews are the only ones who know the real truth. I'm sad to say it like that, but that's what it sounds like when you watch it. The smuggness of most the commentators was disgusting really. No ones making new friends with this film.... if I can call it that, the producer should be down right embarrassed."
1,Rational minds need not apply,"There is no substance in this blatant attempt to ""prove"" that the bible is the word of god and a true and unchanging record of history. Full of pseudoscience and blanket statements that defy logic, if you are not a faith based believer you will not get anything out of this so called documentary. I flushed my money away on this dog."
2,"""What if""","No proof, no facts, just wishing thinking and ""what if"".Alarmist nonsense. Save your money.Seriously, this will not convince you unless you are already convinced.Placebo."
5,100% factual information!,I am absolutely shocked that someone actually left this film 1 star but I guess you can't please everyone. If you read the review though he/she makes it clear the rating has nothing to do with the film but simply out of their hatred for the subject matter. They openly admit to be an atheist but surprising their notion of the information not being credible is an outright LIE. This film is NOT a religious propaganda film at all but presents only factual information that will shock you! Even secular experts and scholars can't argue with the info in this film because it's 100% FACTUAL!
1,For the Bible told me so,If the film had just stuck with the facts and did not have the convert them fools message it would have not be that bad. But boy was it bad with a full cast of greasy untitled experts; it's like the guy making the film asked his uncles to come talk on camera.
1,Bible thumping intolerant nonsense,"If you don't see it the way they see it, (and by the way, they see it the way God sees it), then you don't see it."
2,Propaganda,"Basically a piece of propaganda for fundamentalic Christianity. It states, implies and infers that other religions are wrong and it is wrong to be tolerant of other's beliefs. Also makes leaps about bits of history recorded in Hebrew scripture that the film says proves the existence of God. Is interesting, and may have some validity in some aspects but itself is subversive. Get saved or you are in a heap of trouble is the message."
3,Religious Scare Tactics,"Well I must say, this is one of the most one sided scare tactics I have ever seen. This movie is full of evidence that is not referenced in the movie as to it's source. I am left with the feeling that their truth is the only truth that matters. Not once did they give audience to any opposing view point, they only questioned why they did not except their version. If their truth is so powerful and correct, why did they not let any scholar give a difference of opinion? Also, in the last two minutes, they give the ultimate scare. The standard religious scare tactic, don't be caught on the wrong side of the fence.It would have been a good movie if it was produced by a unbiased source. But the lack of documented evidence during the movie leave the viewer to believe it is a truth.At the core of all religions, is the word faith. Something this movie lacks."
1,make sure to get the security door,when you order this item. Mine did not come with it and I can't find a security door anywhere to block the doggie door in the night. There was a homeless cat came in to the house and my house was flea infested.
5,The Long winded Lady,This book - The Long Winded Lady - was a gift which my daughter enjoyed getting . It was on her wish list and she was very happy that I had purchased it for her.
4,Wonderful Medieval Read,"Okay, I finally went out and bought Connie'snew book. And as usual, I wasn't disappointed.This book weaves a wonderful romanceabout choices and their repercussions. Aknight, whose lost his memory after beingattacked, quickly falls in love the womanattending him. But when his memoryreturns he leaves. However, that is whather and her husband intended him todo...leave them with an heir to their title.What she never intended on, was himcoming back after her husband's death.This is a yummy book, with likeablecharacters you'll find yourself rooting for.Connie is a master of writing historical romances, andproves it yet again with this superb read!"
2,May be better off looking elsewhere,"I had bought this battery for my user-replaceable APC brand of UPS.The battery did not last very long at all - my best guess is that these batteries do not move as quickly as others and that they may not be fresh when obtained.I have since had much, much better results by using the services of one of the many large online battery companies that offer ""SLA"" (""sealed lead acid"") batteries. Most of these companies now offer an interactive display where one will enter in the model number of APC brand UPS that they have and the correct battery replacement will be suggested."
5,Painless upgrade,"I had just had a conversation with a friend remarking how long this battery had lasted when it failed: at least 5 years, maybe 6-7. I thought about buying a new unit, but this seemed like such a much cheaper deal that it would be worth it. The new battery snapped into place and I used the enclosed postage sticker to send the old one back for recycling. It was a snap. This is the real value of the APC equipment: it lasts a long time."
4,Correct Replacement and Pre-Paid UPS Return,"Its just fine - it is the correct replacement battery branded by the UPS manufacturer.It comes with a pre-paid UPS label to return the old battery for recycling (I don't know if it is a legal requirement for the vendor to do this, but, since it is a lead battery, recycling it is a priority, so this is very convenient).And it has worked for about six weeks now without any problems."
2,Misrepresented product and I can't return it for an exchanbe,"When you pull off the label that the distributor uses the original sticker reveals that the battery is only rated at 7.5A. At this price (priced similarly to others rated at 9A) it should be rated at 9A. Also, it is NOT manufactured by APC as the description on Amazon suggests... You will be better served by buying directly from APC. Be warned also that you cannot return a battery to AMAZON for any reason...whether the mistake was theirs or yours, or you ordered the wrong item, etc. No returns period."
2,Misleading Reviews,"I purchased this because several reviews said that this comes with a prepaid label to dispose of the old battery. It does not. If I had known that, I would have paid a couple extra dollars and bought an original equipment battery from APC rather than this third-party knockoff."
4,A peek inside,"I'm very much a fan of Saint-Exupéry. To be honest, I've found the Little Prince the least appealing of his works, and Wind, Sand, and Stars very definitely his best. I enjoyed this look behind the scenes, as it were, at his motivations, relations with his friends, and perhaps his less protected writings. He is apparently an inveterate rewriter, but I found his presumably less worked over letters equally appealing, with merits of their own.I gave this only four stars because you should definitely read other books first, most notably Flight to Arras, written during the period covered by this book. But, and I hate to say this, I really did find his words on war, personal security, and what it means to be human to be very relevant after the terrorist attacks on the US. That part comes out more strongly here than in Flight to Arras."
2,Manhood is womanly,"Like many others, I had to read this book, for college. Before telling us who the author was, we had to read the first two chapters. It was more than easy to tell that it was a woman. After all, she spends more time male bashing than discussing the issues critical to the text. Her development on HOW manhood is a social creation could use some help. How she develops it as it changes though time is interesting, but to bland. Some of her argument is based on stereotypes instead of facts. She may be a proffesor, but not everything she says is truth. Nevertheless, she does an exellent job adding storylines into her text to keep it interesting. I gave it 2 starz b/c the author writes well, but I would not recommend it to anyone unless the title was renamed Womanhood & other male bashing tales."
5,The Legend of the Red Wolf,"I read this book to my second graders at the beginning of the year and it fit perfectly with our conflict resolution unit. It deals with peer pressure, and how a young boy avoids violence and turns the situation into something positive. The use of art as a way to channel childrens' energy is a great lesson for us all."
2,It Sucks!!!,"This phone is nothing like I thought it was going to be. First of all, it is so light, it feels like a toy. When I drop it, the whole thing comes apart. I tend to drop things a lot, so that's not good for me at all. It doesn't even have a speaker button on the base like I thought it did. It does have one on the handset, but that doesn't help a whole lot. When I click over to answer a second call, more than half the time, I can't get back to my first call. I have to hang up and call them back. I should have given this phone a ""1 star"" rating, but I gave it a 2, because I am able to talk on it. That's about the only thing good about it. I would have been better off going to the drug store and buying a phone for $10. This phone costs me about $40, and it was not worth it."
1,Disappointed,"The phone was very annoying. Everytime I tried to call on the phone, it would not connect. I would have to either change the channel or just not call. I was only able to connect to the number I was calling once in the 30+ times I attempted to call. I returned the phone and went and purchase a different manufactured phone. Consumers Report was very wrong in their rating of this phone. The phone was terrible !!"
5,But Not In Shame,"I had found this book in a library years ago and read it. Recently I decided I wanted a copy for my personal collection and found it through Amazon. It's an absolutely excellent book. What's more, the copy I received is in almost unbelievable condition, almost new. The book itself should be read by anyone wanting a different perspective on the beginnings of WWII, and should be read by anyone who prides themselves as a military historian or scholar."
5,Good Set,"With each episode paired with another, this pair seems to be one of the best. There are several good episodes paired with a weeker one. Mirror Mirror is one of my favorite epsiodes of all time. Where the deadly years offers a change of pace. If I was starting my Star Trek collection on DVD, I would make Vol 20 one of the first that I buy."
1,This thing stinks!!!!,"As with the previous review, I have to first of all say that I, too, find the unit a danger to use. When I attempted my first batch, I found that the butter melted down way before the oil got hot enough to start popping the corn. Not a pleasant aroma, butter and oil ""burning"" together. Oh yeh, and the corn never did pop. Figure that! Instructions were measly. I am so disappointed that a unit of this cost could be so completely ineffective. Slap the disney on it to make a few extra bucks and then you find out it's a piece of garbage.I first saw this product demonstrated on the QVC shopping network, and that urged me to find it at a local store. Thankfully I did as it made the return ever so much easier.Pass on this one, folks. It stinks!!"
1,Stuff that works -- NOT,"Although the popper does a good job of popping, the red ""lid"" does not fit properly at all, rendering the bowl useless when turned over. You get HOT butter all over the place. The MFG did respond to calls to their toll free number by claiming that the red lid was the wrong size and by sending another free of charge. But it's pretty clear to me that the problem isn't the red lid, but that the clear dome does not have any lip capable of retaining ANY kind of lid. We did recv a replacemnet lid, but it did not help at all. Fortunately the unit was purchased locally and may be easily returned. BAD DESIGN, DOES NOT WORK."
3,Disappointed,"When we first bought this popper, and used it, we loved it! So cute and fun! But, as time passed, it became less and less efficient, and popped fewer and fewer kernels each time. It's to the point now that it heats, rotates, but doesn't pop anything. It's rather disappointing. Unfortunately, it's also past the 1-year point for the warranty, too. Yes, the little red lid never did fit properly, but we never served out of the lid. The way the top fits on the base is a little quirky, but not a big deal. Well, live and learn. That's what I get for making an impulse purchase, and not researching first. ;-)"
2,does not last,"i bought it last summer, it really works great and still does but the wording only last like 4 months before it fades out thats under high usage and alot of dirt and mud, but worked great to keep the snow off ur boots and mud lol easy to wash also but 2 stars cause the wording faded after 4 months"
3,Funny doormat!,"Doormat was fun, making all who entered do a double take, but it did not hold up very well. It frayed on the edges."
3,"""GO AWAY"" and this means ""YOU!""","This is a well-made doormat with a pertinent message that is perhaps too subtle for the relatively dense or inconsiderate ""average American"" to understand.I find that after purchasing and properly placing this mat at my front door, I unfortunately still have unwanted and unwelcome visitors ringing my door bell and disturbing my much cherished ""peace and quiet"" to which I am entitled as a hermit.Something a bit more extreme/radical is apparently needed to grab the attention of the ""sleepwalkers"" among us who cannot imagine not being welcome wherever they go.I give this doormat with its words of wisdom a neutral ""3"" since for me personally it has not accomplished what it was supposed to do."
1,I was sent a blank mat,"I received a blank door mat instead of the ""go away."" I was sad because now people keep visiting me!"
5,Quite happy,"We purchased this item three years ago, and it still looks new (I was worried about pitting or getting scratches through the bronze coloring, as well as the printed numbers rubbing off or fading and making it clear which numbers our code was composed of - I guess if that happens you'd just change the code anyway). We purchased it so our children wouldn't have to worry about lost/stolen house keys, and so all of us could get back into the house on the occasions when we've forgotten to check that our door into the garage, which can be set for autolock, is not ON autolock before we pull it closed when we run out to get the mail or dump the compostables or whatever."
3,So Sad - Not The Same Sassafras,"Purchased new stone to replace orignal (4 yrs. old) which cracked. Old stone had a smooth surface identical to the expensive ones carried by a well known home demonstration company. Wiped clean and never smoked when heating. Tremendously disappointed with new one - same nasty rough surface as the cheapies available anytime, anywhere. The original had the Sassafras company name and Evanston, Illinois stamped on the back...the new one says Made in Taiwan.You sold out Sassafras and you've lost me as a customer."
1,Not sold as described,"The books binding was so bad that pages came out when I opened it. If this book was ""like new"" then I will stick with brand new books."
3,just listen to neurosis,"nothing new or inovative. just more instrumental music in the vein of isis and neurosis. not bad, just nothing special. i'd much rather listen to eye of every storm or panoptigon."
3,Twang eases muffle,"RS light a match instantaneously with their debut's first, and by far most powerful, melodic theme and spend the rest the album recuperating from that height, only rallying enough energy for the obligatory climax."
3,Decent Post-Rock,"The first time a friend of mine showed me Red Sparowes I was floored. I do not know which albums he showed me, but I don't think this was included in any of it.It's a decent effort that is worth having if you enjoy the genre (as I do), but is not the best effort put forward by the band.The rhythm section is beautiful on this release and if you're a musician it is definitely worth checking out for that.On the plus side, I have listened to the album more than once and continue to enjoy it.I'm a fan of Mono (Japan), Explosions In The Sky, Mogwai, Efterklang, Godspeed You! Black Emperor, Stereolab, Tortoise, Sigur Ros, etc."
1,Its a TOY,"A solid well built , stylish , cute but it DOES NOT do its job .It pick a few hairs here and there but leaves most of them on your face , I admit I do not shave daily but a shaver should handle 3mm long hairs .I dont know why , but the foil holes look too small compared with other shavers , It also irritates and causes cuts . and I shave under water with Gel .Something is wrong with this model and I wish I hadnt bought it and have it shipped to me outside the US - I guess their is a reason why it is heavy discounted .Oh - and for less $$$ I also bought a set of new blades for my old shaver which made it like new ( I wont say the brand but now it gives me very close smooth shave ) so if you got an old solid shaver just replace the blades ."
3,labs,"Not the best quality of ""vacuum-seal"" canisters I have encountered. They aren't terribly sturdy, the little handles feel like they won't last long, but I think for the price, it really isn't too bad. Just another case of ""you get what you payed for."""
5,THIS IS MY FAVORITE,"I LIKE THIS BOOK ALOT. IT'S SO FUN, AND SAD AND ALOT OF THINGS. HER AUNT AND UNCLE SPOIL HER, SHE HAS FRIENDS AND SHE MEETS A CUTE SURFER NAMED TODD. THEY SHOULD BE TOGETHER HE IS SO NICE TO HER AND HE IS A CHRISTIAN, EVERYTHING A CHRISTIAN LADY LOOKS FOR.I REALLY, REALLY, LIKE THIS BOOK."
5,I highly recommend this book to all teenage girls.,I highly recommend this book to all teenage girls because it has very many captivating features that will make you never want want to stop reading. That is the perfect part you do not have to stop reading because this book is three books in one.So after you finish the first one you have two more stories just waiting for you to fall in love with. The best part about this book is that while your reading you get to learn morals because this book is christian based. There is no where you can go wrong with this book it is all around utterly amazing.
5,A must-read,"The first three books in this series are great! It's really hard to put the book down once you've started reading. The three books are fresh, invigorating, very realistic and heartfelt. They really bring you closer to God. I love them!"
1,Mini travel shaver,"Arrived on time and stopped working after three instances. So, I cannibalized the obvious repalacement parts and soldier on...Made in China does not bode well for this product. My original shaver is still working but if this is the quality that now exists, no thank-you.Pass on this item."
4,Compact!,"It is good for travelingh. I ordered it as a replacement for my full size Norelco, which I lost half-way during my deployment in Afghanistan. The vendor does not ship to APO address. I had it shipped home, then to me via USPS. Therefore, it took longer to get here. It is still working well after a couple of months. Although I noticed it nicked the skin more when you push it down to get a closer shave."
2,Nothing new,"I read this book hoping for some greater enlightenment about Adolf Hitler, his life, and times. There is nothing new in this book that has not been covered in about a hundred others biographies. I will not go so far as to say this is a ""bad"" book. That it is certainly not. However, if you are already well read regarding Adolf Hilter you will find nothing new in these pages."
2,The Problem of Perspective,"Kershaw's second volume of his biography of Hitler is disappointing for two reasons. First, it is hardly a biography. Rather, it is a superficial history of the Second World War in Europe, starring Hitler. Little insight into the motives, character, actions and impact of the subject is given. Second, Kershaw has relied very heavily upon a historical point of view represented by Momsen and Irving - that the Holocaust was not intential, but derived from the unexpected contingencies of the war and the way it was conducted. One must observe with regret that not only does Kershaw adopt this view point, but he does not acknowledge the historical debate about this issue or that he has chosen an impugned point of view. This is a book that should be read with great caution by anyone without extensive background on Hitler, the War, and the Holocaust."
4,Good Baseline Guide,"I took this book with me on my trip to Madagascar and used it multiple times. I found it to be pretty accurate for the average tourist, although I did a lot of off the map travel that was not in the book. I would recommend this book to help learn about the travel styles."
1,Bad quality control - a piece of junk,"After six months, the screen cracked, despite the fact that I had treated it with kid-gloves, never dropped it, and it was never used by anyone else. One minute it was fine. I put it on its cradle, and the next minute I noticed that the screen had cracked. It was under warranty, but the company claimed that the crack was not covered. The repair would have cost $150.The person I talked to at customer service was not rude, but it was clear he had heard many complaints like mine before.It is possible that my cracked screen was a rare event, but I think it is more likely that Casio's quality control in the manufacturing of this camera was bad. I think it is also possible that the company knows this. In fact if they have read the reviews on Amazon.com, many of which talk about the poor quality, they have to know it by now.A bad camera. I will not buy anything made by Casio again."
2,A Little Too Smarmy,"Though her thoughts on what she thinks are ""good"" modern architects are very illuminating and insightful, her rants against Disneyfied structures and environments are tiresome, pithy and repetitious. She seems like she's trying to sound like a hip, streetwise rock critic or something. Forget the first 50% of the book (or skim), and save your time and energy for the last 50%."
1,Overrated at 1 star,"This applies to all three parts, altho two of the three parts are totally superfluous!More and larger is not automatically better. In this case the more and larger underlines the mediocrity of this product. Its most prominent features being its total lack of imagination and variation. By this I mean the same ladies and gentlemen doing the same thing over and over and over again. Purely mechanical: in out, in out, gobble, gobble, in out, in out, gobble, gobble etc.If anyone is interested in quality hard core erotica I recommend the works of John B Root, France."
4,waogawognarogn,its nice melodic metal...the lyrics are a little whiny...old killswitch engage was definitely harder but this is a nice cd to listen to when you need a break from all that thrash metal and hardcore...
4,"If you like vocalist that sing through their nose, check this out!",I've been a huge fan of Killswitch for years now and absolutely loved them when Jesse D Leach was in the band. I just cant get into Howards' singing. I'm conviced Howard will single-handedly take down metalcore with his singing. I do recommend you buy this album because the music is still top notch and Howard can yell. I think Killswitch should get a different vocalist for every release.
2,what the hell happened,"their first album was great. very strong, very heavy, and overall a great death metal sound which very rarely comes from a group of such young band members. So why the low rating on the second album? Because everything the first album had that made it great was lost on the second one. They seemed to focus their music on a certain formula to song writing, and used it for every song on the album. Instead of coming up with an original song for every track, they started every song out with a really heavy riff, followed by a weak a@@ chorus. Why is it, that every good metal band out there makes it huge with one album and then goes week there after. Disturbed, Staind, Slipknot, and Flaw just to name a few. Killswitch used to be a real kick a@@ death metal band. Now they are just dumbed down to MTV friendly. I guess I will have to stick with the real metal gods, Children of Bodom, Norther, In Flames and a few other greats I can't think of right now."
3,"MEH,.... pop metalcore","Just not as good as most Swedish Band, like Dark Tranquility for example.Riffs are catchy, but get repetitive. Drummer does his job well, as well as the basist.They have few ideas, but it is comercial crap for mainstream metal scene. of course this is better than Linkin Park/ Korn etc..but this is not VERY GOOD album.I listen it in the car sometimes, and when I vaccuum the room.Also they ignore solos. There is like only one solos on ""Breath Life""Well, it has few thrashy riffs, and catchy melodiesPOP-METALCORE"
3,"A Pretty Sweet Album, Except For One Thing...","Don't get me wrong, this album definately rocks. My main problem is when Howard Jones actually sings. His screaming voice is cool, but his singing voice is too goofy for my taste. That was my problem with Blood Has Been Shed as well. Jesse Leach's singing voice was a lot more melodic and,in my personal opinion, better.The musicfor the tile track is awesome but when Jones starts singing i can't listen to it. How about more screaming next time."
2,"Ah, Mallcore at its finest","Here we have another typical Mallcore band. Old metalica carbon copy riffs, soft death metal wanna be vocals mixed wtih soft punkish choruses, and overall very light fill space music.If this is your cup of tea then go ahead and enjoy, but compared to a lot of other bands they try to copy this is nothing special."
5,One of the best albums in a few years,"I am extreemly picky with my music. I wasn't a big fan of Killswitch before this album. They got a new singer and now they are one of the best metal bands out there. There are no ""skip"" songs on this album. Grammy Nominated-and in my opinion should have won. Won't regret this purchase. Amazing talent in every aspect."
3,Pretty good (3.5 stars)...,"I haven't heard any of the older KsE albums, but this one was pretty damn good. Although almost every chorus is formulaic, the album wouldn't be the same without them. As with every metal band, the cookie monster vocals tend to get annoying after awile. In Short, I would have liked more singing in the verses. That being said, this is still a great addition to any rock music collection...just don't pay more than 10 bucks for it..."
1,Amazon needs to get its' act together,"I ordered this scale twice, and both times it was shipped by Amazon with dead batteries, thus rendering the scale inoperable. While I'm sure it's a good product, it would be nice if Amazon checked it to be sure it was actually functioning before shipping it. I bought another one at a retail store, where I could try out the batteries before purchase."
4,great scale!,This scale is one of the best I have owned. It gives consistent readings on both carpeted and hard floors and has a well thought out modern design. The scale is well constructed for being made in China. My only complaint is that there is no light for the LCD readout.
5,batman on drugs,Pretty good comic it shows a rise and fall in a characters addiction to a cosmetic drug which makes him a lot strong in compensation for a girl dying and him not being strong enough.
3,Not Up To Par With Feinstein's Other Books,"There used to be a time when I would anxiously wait to read Feinstein's latest book. Although this book is not bad, it certainly is nowhere near as compelling as some of his other works like ""A Good Walk Spoiled"" and ""A Civil War."" The Patriot League is an interesting subject to write on and you have to admire many of the players. But this book was easy to put down, in fact I didn't read a page for about a month. I do think that Feinstein could lay off the Duke references, we all know he's a Blue Devil grad. For college basketball fans looking for one of Feinstein's better works, check out ""A Season On The Brink"" and ""A March To Madness."""
3,Not as interesting or inspiring as I would have hoped.,"He basically just rehashes the season. I didn't really feel connected to the players, coaches or schools. Some of the material that discussed the Army program, gave me a good sense of place, but that was about it. It would have been wonderful to learn more about the day to day lives of these impressive young men. Sitting around and talking hoops with them while they ate dinner after practice--seeing them at home on vacation. That type of thing. None of this really came through."
1,The Last Amateurs: Playing for Glory and Honor in Division I,"John Feinstein's book is interesting, but I cannot help but see while reading his work that he falls again into the trap of bringing his own personal bias and agenda into his writings, ultimately providing a disservice to the reading public."
1,Why do people find Feinstein tiresome? Maybe the bias,"A couple of recent reviewers have protested that the book is OK and that anti-Feinstein reviewers were being malicious. On the contrary, while Mr. Feinstein may be a decent sportswriter, his views on college basketball are so biased that it is difficult to seperate the book and the bias. So, one can only conclude that anything he writes on college basketball is fiction, at best."
3,"not his best, but a fun read","Just finished this book last night, spent nearly 4 months on it. It really takes a lot of work to get into it, but as the season winds down and you get to know the players and coaches a bit better, it takes on a life of its own. So, that's to say the last 150 pages or so are worth the time. Problem is, you need to read the first 250 to have a good idea what is going on.The message, as always with Feinsteid, is clear. College b-ball ain't what it should be. But as someone coming from a D3 school, I've know this for a long time."
1,Another Feinstein love note to himself,"Please please please please please never let this pretentious fop write another book again. In typical fashion, Feinstein glorifies anyone who cooperated with him for this book and denigrates anyone who didn't. You wonder how this classless writer has any time to write books anymore - he's on TV so often he must carry a clip-on microphone at all times. Feinstein is the most unprofessional sportswriter working today. Having burned bridges in the golf world and in major college basketball, among many other areas, he is forced to write a book about the Patriot League. Don't get me wrong - there are great stories to be told about the schools and kids in that league. Unfortunately, it still hasn't been told. No story is bigger than Feinstein's massive and unwarranted ego, and this book is simply the latest example."
2,Good Grief! It's Agatha!,"Grimes seems to have somehow forgotten connections and motivation. She gives no motive for the first murder(s) except one which was discovered well after the fact(s) of such.And would someone please kill Aunt Agatha. She's consumed more fairy cakes than I can count and I don't even know what they are. And it is so Boring's to read about it over and over and over again.Grimes has created a wonderful character in Melrose Plant and she should ""run with"" him. Jury is so sunk in a mire (or fen). Even Wiggins is more interesting than Jury and I want to smack Wiggins a lot of the time. I can also do without CarolAnne, Mrs. Wasserman, and Stan Keeler(& his dog).This ""series"" has run its course unless it takes a big turn."
4,Continued brilliance,"Martha Grimes has produced another well written novel. I liked the fact that she she wrote a Richard Jury novel without her featured detective (for the most part). Melrose Plant is once again the star of her stories. My only deduction in rating is for the Bentchley children. Still, it was a great read."
1,Very Disappointed,"I was most disappointed in Lamorna Wink. After reading every one of her books written before 1995, I found this one to be decidedly unpleasant. The sleazy story line about killing innocent children for the thrill of a snuff movie was unnecessary. Also woven into this story was an equally sickening plot line about another child who was murdered for revenge. Come on, Martha Grimes, get out of the gutter! There are some sensationalistic topics that are just too unutterably disgusting for any but the most perverted and you have managed to touch on them all here! Bring back the characters we love and leave the seedy storylines OUT."
1,Never Again,"I had read several of the Richard Jury books and enjoyed them very much. This one, however, is my last. There were a couple of jarring elements, perhaps because I haven't read the books in order. For example, Melrose Plant's love interlude seemed totally out of character. What makes this the last one I read is the treatment of the two children's deaths. The author should have put a warning on the front cover."
2,maybe if you're a hardcore Martha Wash fan...,"this song is pretty dull considering that it is comprised of Jason Nevins on the mix, and Martha Wash on the vocal. This one is for Hardcore Nevins or Wash fans. None of the mixes are very exciting, they all sound the same. Highly forgettable."
1,"Poorly Constructed, Not Recommended","I bought this timer based on the recommendation of America's Test Kitchen testing lab. The timer works as advertised but the audible alarm is not very robust, you cannot hear it from another room. Control of all of the various functions is somewhat confusing, certainly non-intuitive.Worse, the magnetic strip on the back of the timer is affixed to the plastic body with double-sided tape that will fail in very short order, allowing the magnet to separate from the body. My first timer fell off the front of my fridge onto a hard tile floor, shattering the case and destroying the timer. Amazon replaced that at no charge. A second timer did exactly the same thing after about a week's use, although this time I expected it and it only fell to the countertop.Instead of the dual timer, I do recommend the Polder 898 Clock, Timer and Stopwatch, available in Black or White, $15.00. It is very loud, comes with a laynard so you can hang it around your neck, and is simple to use."
2,Polder 893-90 Kitchen Timer,"While the timer is a lot easier to use than most( west bend, chefs, for example), the alarm is too quiet. When my exhaust fan is on, I can't hear the timer. It's barely audible when the room is quiet and you sure won't hear it if you are in the next room."
1,The clock gains several minutes per day,"The clock gains almost an hour a day. I bought 2 of these, and both of them have the same problem."
2,Beyond Any Time,"In spite of the brilliant imagery on the DVD cover this film has very little in its production values to recommend it on any level. The 'Vision of the Future' is almost completely missing visually (except for some futuristic triangles!), the acting is, again ,almost missing, the story line and script are pathetic . Unless you are a real fan of BBB movies don't bother. Sorry"
4,Most useful as an attitude check,"This is a great tool to have as you build out your toolchest for corporate career growth. The style is a little dense at times. One eye-opening bit of advise was to not think of ""politics"" as a four-letter word. This admonishment sets the tone for a very practical and pragmatic approach to leadership through indirect influence. A good train read."
4,"If Austin Powers is back, why not Marv's biofeedback book?","The futuristic scenarios seem a little dated after all these years, but they're still thought provoking. And the basic insights into using biofeedback are as useful as when the book was written. Whether you are a generation x'er trying to cope with parentental stress, or a 60's person who is a bit rusty on meditation techniques, Biofeedback: Turning On... shares valuable insights and specific techniques that you'll find helpful."
3,Light Boy is to Expensive!!!!!,"Ok well this ""Light Boy"" thing Rocks its great it has a light and a miginfine glass. The only thing is that its to darn expensive. Yesterday I got the mad catz Starter pack. It had A AC adaptor, Rechargeable battery pack, The Light boy thing, and a Link cable for only $.... The Light alone is like 4... (the mad catz version) thats a big diference! Remember it requires 2 AAA batteries."
2,MEAGAN GOOD: VIDEO GIRL,"Meagan Good works at a curio shop for a perfectionist. When she gets an opportunity to dance in hip-hop videos she tries it out. The young director takes a personal interest in Meagan who can't resist him.Meagan spirals downward as her career goes upward. She has dreams were she talks to her dead sister who tries to get her on the right path. The film was packed with cliches, stereotypes, and mediocre acting. To assist Meagan in her downward/upward spiral, other video girls influence her.Meagan is excellent as a video girl, but the rest of the film lacks credibility and is clearly a ""come to Jesus"" film. Message: People who do drugs, do so because there is a void in their life. I was so bored with the film, it created a void in my life...No nudity. Rape attack."
3,Genius or Hogwash,"Mr Jayes published this book 14 years ago. In the text of the book he made it clear that this was to be the first part of his thesis on the origin of consciousness. Part 2 was to follow shortly. He has not, to my knowledge done so. Why? The academic reviews were respectable, and in the case of one from John Updike, positively glowing. But a niggling fact remains. Has Mr Jayes recanted? Is his thesis rubbish? Where's part 2."
4,Wonderfully crafted and highly readable.,"Another review used the word ""poetry"" to describe Julian Jaynes' effort on this book, and I have to agree. While not finished, I was captured from the very beginning with the artfulness of the opening salvo:""O, what a world of unseen visions and heard silences, this insubstantial country of the mind! What ineffable essences, the touchless rememberings and unshowable reveries! And the privacy of it all! A secret theater of speechless monologue and previent counsel, an invisible mansion of all moods, musings, and mysteries, and infinite resort of disappointments and discoveries. A whole kingdom where each of us reigns reclusively alone, questioning what we will, commanding what we can. ... This consciousness that is myself of selves, that is everything, and yet nothing at all - - what is it?""Be ready to be drawn in."
5,The Origin of Consciouness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind,One of the 2 or 3 most important books I have ever read
2,It's fantasy,"Julian Jaynes' The Origins of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind exerts its fascination on lots of people. The thesis is compelling, if only for its originality and the conviction with which it is expressed. In the first part of the book, in which Jaynes argues that many activities that people undertake do not require consciousness to occur, struck me as reasonable. But when he actually starts to look at the ancient evidence -- primarily from Mesopotamia, Egypt, and Greece -- the power of his argument is undercut, and finally demolished, by the simple fact that he does not understand the source material he has nor the societies which produced it. In the end, Jaynes has written a wonderful fantasy, fodder for many late nights of undergraduate speculation and science fiction writers in search of ideas; but as a real history of human consciousness, no one should take it seriously."
4,An Interesting Read,I was very interested in the discussion of the bi-cameral mind and its relationship to schizophrenia. The development of consciousness in the contemporary mind as a replacement to the bi-cameral mind was quite intriguing. The historical development of mind related matters from the second millenium B.C. to the present time was an interesting side. Julian Jaynes has excellent command of this subject. He has well organized his ideas and developed them. It made an interesting read. Thank you.
5,stunning - a must-read,"It's rare to find a book that is at once so thought-provoking and also so eloquent as Jayne's ""Origin."" If you are looking for an easy read, then THIS IS NOT THE BOOK FOR YOU. It challenges the reader on so many levels, and I have been recommending this to all of my favorite literati."
5,Great review,I got a beautiful 14k yellow gold box chain at a very reasonable price and I just love it. I would deal with this company again.
2,Pedagogically Unsound!,Up until now I had been very impressed with the Starting Out Series by Everyman Chess. The first two books I studied were great (they were Starting Out: The King's Indian and Starting Out: The Colle).Starting Out: The Ruy Lopez did not measure up to either of those books in my opinion. The format is basically the same but the author just did not explain things well. His annotations were dry at best and completely uninformative at worst! There was also no real room for further study or analysis.I recommend the other two Starting Out books mentioned above but cannot in good conscious recommend Starting Out: The Ruy Lopez. These books are meant to be heavy on explanation for newer and improving chess players. The annotations contained in this book functioned more as bland comments with no instructional content.
3,Nautilus Stability Ball,"I think it is an adequate for exercise ball however, the material it is made of seems a little too thin and too flexible. I prefer a harder and thicker feeling ball. I was pleased to get the directions packet and the pump and extra fixtures. The diagram of how to exercise with the ball is helpful."
5,Truth stranger than fiction?,"Is the author, Warren Adler, psychic or just very in tuned with modern day politics in Washington? Senator Love has some shocking connections to the Levy/Condit case. A very attractive senator is surrounded by a string of unsolved murders, mostly his interns. Is truth stranger than fiction? In this case, it's a tie."
5,Great Game! Shows what the PSP can do!,"This game really highlights what the PSP can do. The graphics are beautiful. The gameplay is solid. My only gripe is that after playing it it was a bit short. Took under 9 hours for me. Also, an more expanded weapons system would have been nice."
4,A good resource for grave hunters,"I loved Permanent Californians! Unfortunately, it is out of date (1989). It also doesnt have all the celebrities but it gets you around the Calfornia cemeteries and gives you an interesting history!! I would highly recommend this book to all gravehunters!!!"
3,Picture is misleading,The picture and description show the memory card as included yet all I received was the tremor pack. The tremor pack itself works great and is so much better than the standard rumble pack.
1,This Tremor pak is just to big.,"This rumble pak is too big, uses up batteries rapidly, it's so heavy that you hardly ever feel the rumble, Nintendo should have built-in rumble in thre controllers this sucks."
5,The real IKE,"Stephen Ambrose has written some of the best WW@ history ever and this is no exception. Here we see the REAL general Eisenhower, the doubts along with the confidence, the heartaches along with the triumph. For a rare glimpse of the higest levels of command in the most important moment in the twentieth century, this is it."
5,The greatest thing ever!,I am bringing this on my next deployment. So many great ps1 titles I get to relive while in the desert. screen quality and sound are incredible. You can even play 2 or more players.
4,a must have,"this is hip hop at its finest, inventive, original and in your face. lyrics are smooth as well as street based and introspective. I would recommend this album to anyone who really has a taste for hip hop. Not just some R&B hyped rap. This is a hip hop experience."
2,"good idea, boring rapper","In principle guru's experimentation on jazzmatazz is a good thing. The variety of guest artists adds diversity and originality to each track, and gives the cd a distinct jazz flavor. However, there is one problem with the album: guru really isn't a very good lyricist. His rhymes are boring, simple, and formulaic. An example from ""take a look at yourself"": ""In there gettin funky with the track/I used to drive a cadillac/it got me there and back."" As you can see, the lack of diversity in guru's delivery makes for a fairly bland album, despite its experimental nature and promising direction."
2,to much knit,i only know how to crochet. ive tried to learn to knit and cant. i bought this book in hopes it would have an even amount! NOPE only 5 crochet and 10+ knit! and all the crochet patterns are almost all the same! if you only know how to crochet dont waste your money! you can find these patterns for free online anyways... they are so easy...but if you are a knitter go for it! there was awesome patterns i really wish i could use! beautiful! just not to crocheters!
5,Outstanding Reading!,"I highly recommend this book to those who have any interest in genealogy, history or just enjoy reading the saga of a family. Excellent reading. Very enjoyable. Difficult to put down."
4,Adds to the gaming experience,"This Tremor Pack adds on to the N64 controller in the back. When correctly attached, the tremor pack vibrates the controller adding realism of the game. Once you buy one, and play with it, and then you play on a controller that doesn't have one, you'll want to buy another."
3,"Pak works, but not worth getting","I got this a while ago, and in my opinion it really isn't worth getting. There are many other rumble paks that have memory cards in them, and they don't cost much more than this. So as you can see, this just really isn't worth it.However, rumble paks are great, they add so much to a game when you are playing it.Pros:1) Rumble adds a great effect2) Works good/durableCons:1) Too big2) No memory cards"
2,Stopped working after 6 months,"I owned this frother, and made frappe (coffee) with it occasionally. It worked fine at first, but then suddenly died, after 6 months of not so heavy use. I am now looking for another frother with a better motor."
1,NOT AS DESCRIBED,"The description of this item says EPSON MATTE Photo Paper and what you receive is Epson GLOSSY Photo Parer. I expected to receive Matte and I got Glossy. Looking back at the picture of the item, it does say Glossy in the picture, BUT I went by the Item's description as I had searched for Matte paper and this item was listed as being Matte in the Item Title in Bold letters."
5,5-star plus,"This is a great fun book, full of life. The author describes the role that she and her ""stunt quilters"" played in the filming of the movie, How To Make An American quilt starring Winona Ryder. Quilters who loved the movie (based on the book by Whitney Otto) will love McCormick's book too. It contains full-sized patterns for several of the quilts you see in the movie, with all the details you never notice in the film."
2,135 fps!,this thing is great if you are four it doesnt even feel like you are geting hit spend 10$ more and you can get guns with 200fps I mean not that much of a differance in price for a way better weapon
5,Must have for history geeks....,"While jounalists may enjoy this book; as a historian, it is fascinating and illuminating. I highly recommend this book for anyone intrigued by early American history."
5,For Music Lovers,"This film is a must see for music lovers! The music itself is a stand alone character in this very well crafted story. Of course, the title of the film also resonates for music historians. Go ... enjoy the easy ride(r)! It's worth it."
1,Dead pixels,"I have three LCD computer monitors (made by NEC-Mitsubishi) and two notebook computers (Compaq & Gateway), and none of them had a single dead pixel, but the PS One LCD screen I bought had not one, not two, but a total of 5 dead pixels! Luckily I was able to get an exchange, but for the money spent I expected a better product."
4,Amc Quiet Water Canoe Guide,"Excellent book, I recommend this to anyone. I use this book for canoe trip planning with my family. Detailed information is given here. As usual it is another fine book by AMC."
5,Excellent CD!!,"This is a great, relaxing CD. Jane and Al are superb with Trans-Siberian Orchestra, and they are superb on their own! They are very talented musicians!! I recommend this CD."
4,Good yo-yo for the money,My 7 yr old son bought this and really likes it. It is a nice step up from a Duncan without bearings. Nothing too special about it otherwise.
4,Good yo-yo for beginners and beyond,We started looking for yo-yos for our daughter after her first really cheap toy one finally broke after a few years of abuse. She never really got the hang of it and it never really seemed to work well. It was one of those soft rubbery gummy style ones that you can not take apart.After some searching and reading reviews we settled on this one. Within the day of delivery she was actually able to use it very well. It comes with an extra string and it clearly comes apart for maintenance so for the money it is a good deal.I have been using a yo-yo for a long time myself and at one point in the past used to be able to do some tricks. I was able to pick this thing up and was able to get the hang of it on the first try and knock out some of the old tricks.So for the money it is highly recommended for beginners and beyond.
1,ORIGINALS . . . PLEASE!,"Lucas needs to check his overinflated ego at the door - his ""special editions"" were awful! Why rework it even further?! Why destroy a masterpiece by continuing to to add paint and more paint? Lucas needs to release the original versions of the films which were perfect. ""Modernizing"" the films by adding more digital effects makes the old effects look silly. Lucas is ruining these films - STOP IT! RELEASE THE ORIGINALS! YOU CAN""T HAVE MY MONEY UNTIL THEN - you fool!"
1,"George, You Became Wealthy from the ORIGINAL THEATRICAL VERSIONS!","It is very simple, George. You first released ""Star Wars"" in 1977. That release made you a billion dollars then and later for ""The Empire Strikes Back"" and ""Return of the Jedi"". Perhaps you loathe them now. Perhaps you wake up late at night, screaming incoherently, drenched in sweat, and tortured over the hell you created 35 years ago. Well, too bad. Suck it up. You are a billionaire thanks to moviegoers that saw your movies between 1977 and 1983, NOT 1997, 2004, and 2011. I am going to be the one to say it: You OWE US the original theatrical versions. Why? Because those are the ones that gave you your fortune, that we fell in love with growing up. The ones we paid for in 1977, 1980, and 1983. So yes, George, you imbecile, you owe us THOSE versions. Anything else is a stab in the back and an insult to every moviegoer that made you a billionaire. Period. Over and out."
1,Not the original . . .,"I will not purchase any Star Wars product until Lucas provides the original three movies - with a quality transfer - in blu ray. And by original, I mean the original version that I watched in theaters 30+ years ago."
2,Gimme the Star Wars I fell in love with!!!,"I have to agree with the consensus here. I want the original theatrical releases, especially the original Star Wars VI A New Hope. I fell in love with that movie when it first came out, and I don't want the silly new version with all the CGI stuff, and the conversation with Jaba's henchman is re-performed outside the bar with Han and Jaba himself. It's just silly to have that scene twice, with almost the exact same dialogue, just so they can say ""look, we stuck Jaba in the original movie!!"" So what? Let the blue ray set with the CGI enhancements stand, but also release blu ray versions of the original theatrical releases of the first three movies."
1,"""Original"" is a flat out lie","The fact that this says ""The Original"" but is instead the 1997 CGI sexed-up versions is despicable. It should say ""Special Edition"" as they were always previously referred to.There are literally thousands of people asking for the ORIGINAL UNALTERED movies so that we can BUY THEM WITH MONEY. Why does it have to be so hard?"
1,Bad Sound,"Everybody, listen to this set in 5.1 surround. You will find not only the music errors in the rear channel (left & right swapped) and the loss of background music and explosions, but also the dialog is messed up. Episode Four has places where the dialog keeps switching from clear to not-so-clear like a high frquency filter is being switched in and out. Mr ""THX"" really should not only be ashamed, but immediately pull all the copies from retail shelves and refund anyone with a receipt full price until discs can be released that are not screwed up. DON'T BUY IT!!!"
3,Special Edition Ok / Re-release no,"I have no problem with the Special Edition but a re-release on VHS no thanks. Why can't they bring this special edition on DVD, 'cause 15 years ago a bought the original trilogy, 5 years ago the restored version, and three years later the special edition, all on VHS. So, I think I will not buy this one, and wait... 3 stars for the Special edition and a big, big 5 stars for whole trilogy."
5,Another Step into the Star Wars Universe,"I read a few of the reviews, and I saw that a lot of people are angry that George Lucas changed certain scenes nad even added some in certain parts. I only have to say, who cares? The Star Wars movies are still great, and I'm sorry that a scene that lasts less than a minute is enough to make you get all angry and say ""But Han should have shot first!"" First off, it is a movie, and therefore it should be treated as such. Secondly, do you think George Lucas is doing this to please his fans? It's his universe so I think he can do what he wants with it. He always wanted Greedo to shoot first, so then when the SE's came out, he made him shoot first.Now, I haven't seen these movies yet (Of course, none of us SHOULD HAVE) but I'm still writing a review ahead of time because the movies will always be great. It is still the classic epics from the past and will remain to be classic epics in the future."
3,Original or Special Editions,Is this DVD set the original Star Wars films or the Special Editions released a few years ago?
2,NOT the original theatrical movies...this should be made clear,Sorry I bought this...I was sure it was the original theatrical versions....but it is NOT. The promotion for this set is deceitful...not clear at all.
1,These are NOT the Original Trilogy films,"Just be warned. These are NOT the Original Trilogy films. The best quality of the Original trilogy is the non-widescreen, letterboxed Japanese laserdisc version available on DVD. Because that is the highest quality the Original Trilogy has been released. Period."
1,Nobody wants to see Greedo shoot first!,"Seriously, George, listen to your fans and release the original versions of the movie. Nobody wants to see Greedo shoot first! You're ruining your own movies like a real jack@@@."
2,What a Joke,I recently got the Trilogy and first thing I wanted to see was the preview of Episode 2 in which was so I thoght gonna be good. Boy was I wrong. It showed a quick inerview of Gorge Lucus and a C-3PO's voice Anthony Daniels. That was It. It was so bad I could have puked. Man I'm the sucker for buying it. Please forgive me when I say that it was poor. For as rich as Geroge Lucus is I would have thought that he would make the preview better then this
1,"Lucas, Stop Changing these movies!","Be warned, these are not the original films! More changes have been made, and all of them are bad. Look on youtube for further information."
5,Never looked or sounded better,"One warning: THESE MOVIES ARE VERY LOUD. The THX is mesmerizing but the soundtrack is loud especially if you have surround which my husband and I do. The pictures are clear and crisp, and the transfer to DVD was better than i expected. But, Lucas has the technology to do whatever he wants. We finally have these 3 classic films on disc and in a cool carrying box. Excellent work Lucasfilm and Skywalker Sound!"
1,I will not buy this!!!!,It's really sad that Lucas has destroyed such a great piece of film magic. I will not buy this DVD box set and if you ever want to see the original trilogy released on DVD I suggest you don't buy it either.
2,Finally!,"It's great to finally see Star Wars (the original trilogy -- and the best) on DVD. I just can't believe that he revamped the effects. Sure, we have better technology now, but the movies weren't made now.Thank God I have the movies on wide-screen laserdiscs which are the *original* non-special edition versions. If you have a LaserDisc player, go on eBay and buy the laserdisc versions instead. Sure, the picture might not be as good as a DVD, but it's much better on LD than on VHS. Plus, the LD is widescreen, not ""special-edition"", and it will last a lot longer than a video tape."
2,Get the newer set with the bonus disc,There's really not much to write. The bonus disc is pretty cool and worth getting. Get that set instead.
5,STAR WARS ROCKS!,"A classic MUST HAVE!!! The original is on DVD and I am so glad! Star Wars fans much appreciation will they show, hmmm? (sorry for the bad Yoda impression)"
1,Highly disappointed,"When I heard that George Lucas had finally decided to release the classic starwars trilogy on DVD, I thought it would be just that. The unfooled around with Classics from the seventies and eighties. Boy were we all lied to.Not only is this the updated versions that were released in the late ninties, which contained too much in the way of computer animation that it lost the heart and soul that lucas breathed into them those many years ago, but he has gone and ruined them further. Simple things, I know, like the changing of Boba Fetts voice, or the computer generating of the Sail Barge, but it was enough to make me want to destroy George.My advice would be to find the origional trilogy on VHS. If you are able to find it, let me know where."
1,"Is there a ""Special"" Edition Mona Lisa?",One reason I won't buy these is because if Lucas ever does release the originals I will buy those and never watch this edition. Also I'm not sure I'll miss much by skipping the making-of documentary since all the new footage will probably be about the added effects and how much everyone loves them.But the main reason I won't get this is because doing so would be doing my part to reassure Lucas that the garbage he's been selling us is satisfactory.
1,Oh George,"Pretty unbelievable George continues to knowingly screw over his fanbase.Why, when it would be so easy, would you not at least, in the very least include the original versions of the movies?1 star for being a deluded pompous ass. Loved the originals, but the new redone scenes and such quickly take me out of the movie and make me mad - they're almost as irritating as episodes I-III."
1,Canceling preorder,"After reading about all the unwelcome changes to the Blu-Ray editions, I too have decided to cancel my preorder.Such a shame..."
1,Still Waiting For The True Version,"Hey face it folks. The only way were ever going to get the ""original"" Star Wars in HD is if George Lucas were to up and die right now. With that said it looks like we have a long wait ahead of us. Oh and Han shot first!!!"
1,If it ain't broke...,"This DVD set is being marketed on television as the ""classic Star Wars"" when in fact, it is a transformed version of what we, as children, fell in love with. Lucas should have NEVER tampered with what was already perfect. Replacing good old fashioned characters with computer graphics and altering scenes was a huge mistake. We original Star Wars fans made Lucas what he is today. We paid to see the movies. We spent hundreds on the toys. It's time for Lucas to pay his FANS back and offer the REAL classic trilogy on DVD."
1,Insulting blu ray box set,"I hardly ever write reviews but feel compelled to do so here because the changes to the originals are so insulting to both the audience and loyal fan base of star wars. Initially I was prepared to overlook the changes for the sake of something very special now enhanced in 1080p glory. However having seen these changes and how pathetic they are this is not something anyone should put up with. I've waited this long for star wars in blu ray, I'm happy to wait longer for either the originals in blu ray or 3d blu ray.I must admit I thought everyone was just nitpicking and being overly harsh with the changes, but see them for yourself (or better yet YouTube it and save yourself the money) and disappointment is a given. I wouldn't even classify myself as a fanboy either so god only knows what all you real die-hard fans feel about it all! Shame on George Lucas."
2,magic lost,"Watching movies from the pass is to recover, not only the images, but the memories and impact it had on you. If the movie is not the same the magic doesn't work. It's a different movie. And I won't take a movie with FX of today and haircuts from the 70s. The Empire Strikes Back is the one I like most. Thank God this one has not been mutilated. For me all the other movies of the saga have become extras I have included on my Empire dvd box (they hardly fit). The same goes for Close Encounters Of The Third Kind."
3,YET MORE REVISIONS HAVE BEEN MADE!!!!!!,"It has come to my attention through a retail employee who has seen this DVD set, that additional revisions have been made to the special edition versions from 1997!! I will tell you what has been confirmed: In A New Hope, Jabba has been redone entirely to resemble Return of the Jedi's Jabba. In The Empire Strikes Back, Ian Mcdiarmid who plays Palpatine has done some material for the hologram sequence. Finally for Return of the Jedi, the planet Naboo has been added to the end celebration sequence. For those of you who are praying that Hayden Christensen will not appear THINK AGAIN! It is confirmed, Sebastian Shaw who played the original Anakin ghost at the end of the film has been replaced by Hayden. No joke!!! Enjoy!!"
1,Disk requires an update to play?,I get a warning that I can't watch the disk without an update. I'll go out on a limb and assume that has something to do with copy protection and not enhancing my movie experience.Maybe I'll change the review if I can figure out how to actually watch the movie.
2,Barely Makes Two,This is just another chance for the studio to cash in on the Original Trilogy. The only reason the set receives two stars is for the quality of the films. It is pointless to buy this unless you don't have other versions of the movies.Just an attempt at extra cash with the release of the prequel trilogy.
3,What Most Seem to Want,"I have to admit...I will be buying the upcoming six disc set, but what I'd really like to see and what it looks like most of the other ""original"" fans would like to see is the Blu-Ray version of the originals. Clean up the video and audio tracks, but do not give us any of the special edition changes. Less is more. I am however, seriously considering cancelling my 6 disc BD boxed set in favor of the 3 disc set of both versions (wouldn't bother watching the SE versions though) and the 3 disc set of the newer trilogy. Sigh. If only a BD boxed set existed with this configuration, I would be satisfied."
1,Special Edition Isn't So Good,"""A Famous Filmmaker Once Said 'Film's Are never Completed; They're Only Abandoned.' And Rather Than Living With My Abandoned Movie I Really Wanted To Go Back And Complete It.""George LucasStrong words indeed, but everyone around the world from 1977 to 1996 seemed to feel ""Star Wars,"" ""The Empire Strikes Back"" and ""Return of the Jedi"" were pretty complete movies that were able to please the whole family. Everyone, that is, except George Lucas. Lucas says he was never satisfied with how the movies turned out and since finishing the original trilogy had visions of an ultimate version. Little would he know that much of the world would absoloutly dispise his ultimate versions of the movies.Lucas said these are the way he's always visioned the movies, and yet, these versions [stunk]. Hope this review helped."
1,DON'T DO IT!!!,Instead of listening to just about EVERYONE Lucas has decided to ruin these movies even more. If you buy this then you are telling him it's okay for him to do this. Just find some sap that actually bought this and borrow the extras. Join the movement! Wait for the original unaltered movies!
1,WHAT A JOKE!THIS IS TOTAL GARBAGE!!,Its one thing to NOT release the ORIGINAL Theatrical Cuts..its another to re re re re re re release the same SE editions over and over again. DO NOT BUY THESE.Its just another commercial pile of junk. HOw Greedy can one person and a corporation be??Ask the RIAA???
4,Somewhat disappointed...,"I must confess, I am disappointed that the original, untouched versions of these films will not be released on DVD. They're the films I grew up on, not the retouched versions.Why couldn't George Lucas do what his buddy Steven Speilberg did with E.T.? My E.T. DVD set has two discs, one with the original, one with the retouched, and there's actually a third version if you count the one that has an alternate soundtrack of a live orchestra playing the music.Why not satisfy both audiences? I liked some of the retouched bits (like reinserting Han talking to Jabba the Skinny Hutt in A New Hope--it went far in explaining who the heck Jabba was in Return of the Jedi), but I still want to see the untouched originals in DVD.Five stars for being the classics they are, but -1 star for not giving us the option to see BOTH versions of the films."
1,Another Butchered Copy,"I call for a massive collaboration of the original trilogy fans to DEMAND an ORIGINAL COPY, unaltered version of the original, un-cg'd version of star wars."
1,"For God's sake, WHY?","Why do so many people who are are protesting this ""Original Trilogy"" give it more than one star?Why is this not labeled as ""Special Edition"" if Lucas is not trying to conceal that fact?Why is Lucas unwilling to present the true originals in their unaltered form when they made him so rich and famous?Why do we have to accept these terrible versions of such perfect classic films?Why do I even have to ask these questions?Thanks a lot, George! Thanks a lot!"
1,"Five for the movies, but definatly one for the repackaging of last years edition. (just because I'm mad I don't have this box)","I didn't mind when Lucas came out last year with the extended re digitalized set, but this is just too much. Frankly I'm not happy with this because the box is definatly cooler then the old one. Who wouldn't want the original picturing on their box of star wars? But the fact remains that Lucas is squeezing the life from the trilogy by reselling and reselling the old material in new packaging. When will he stop? Maybe start giving us newer editions of Indiana Jones instead.Buy this edition if you haven't already been scammed into buying his last year edition. Like I said, the box is definatly way cooler, but the principles that Lucas is displaying is sorry indeed for the market, heck forget the market. What about us poor college buyers that would kill for this edition?"
2,I've got a very bad feeling about this.,"It's no wonder that I'm not going to order this. Now I've grown up with Star Wars. I had all the toys growing up and was one of the biggest fans ever and now it's been what...33 years since the first film and having to go along for the ride of vhs, dvd and finally blu-ray, I thought this would finally be the last version any of us fans would ever need. Nope. Old George just can't keep his hands out of the artsy-fartsy cookie jar and continues to keep messing with something that he should've left alone in the first place.NOPE! No more. I've had it up to here with this and until George comes to his senses and figures out that this is not what the fans want and decides to put out the one and only original version that I first saw in theaters, he will not get one more penny from me. I hate to say it George, but you and you alone have sullen my appetite for SW."
4,Belongs in everyone's movie collection,"What more is there to say about the SW trilogy? The packaging is well done (and matches the Episode I packaging) and the overall film quality is quite good. Each film has been re-mastered and these are the ""Special Edition"" releases that were brought back to the theaters in 1997 with the added scenes and CGI. I also like the fact that Episode IV's (a new hope) packaging describes the fact that this episode takes place 30 years after the Phantom Menace...nice touch. What was cool was that you got a brief sneak peek at Ep II (which has since been released) at the beginning of a New Hope.Out of all the films, I'd say Episode VI-Return of the Jedi is the weakest. This is a must-have until the original trilogy is re-released on DVD (which George Lucas has been heard saying won't happen until AFTER Episode III is released...and that will be at LEAST 4-5 years since filming won't even start until June 2003!)."
1,Wait for the Real Original Movies,"Do not by this set. I've watched them all and they are not worth it. Lucas is deliberately milking the fans for all they are worth by not including the original theatrical cuts in this release. He wants you to buy these special editions and then buy the original releases again when he releases them next time. Don't encourage this kind of nonsense. Almost all of the changes are bad, unnecessary, and a few are downright insulting to the audience. Wait for the theatrical releases because they will be released eventually. Do not waste money on these."
1,"When great movies get ""enhanced"" we all lose.","I really feel sorry for anyone who hasn't seen the original trilogy sans ""Special Editioning"".Imagine you have three perfectly good birthday cakes. Now imagine that the bakery took the cakes away from you and used computers to add a dinosaur slipping on poo and various other random dumb crap to the birthday cakes and tried to sell them to you again.I think that is the perfect analogy for what happened with these beloved sci-fi films."
5,Fun for everyone,"The whole Star Wars trilogy was superb. The storyline wasn't the strong point, even though it was fun to keep in touch with it, the real strong point was the action and adventure. I don't care what other people say about this film, I think it is great! A real Saturday night movie, grab some popcorn, a large Coke and sit back and enjoy the ride!"
1,Originals don't matter if the quality is this bad.,"This was released for the die-hards who can't live their lives because of the additions made in the 1990's. So what do you get? Non-standard letterbox (these are NOT made for today's television standards and look just as bad on full screen TV's). Grainy picture, especially on the original movies. 2 channel sound on the originals and no bonus discs whatsoever. Your better off watching the original VHS tapes if you want Han Solo to shoot first that badly. (If your a die hard).The reviews here on Amazon are laughable and the quality transfers on this set are a joke. Don't waste a dime on this unless your a Star Wars fan that can't do without a DVD copy of the originals. But why? Better to buy the masterful blu-rays and skip the added scenes manually or go back to the VHS tapes.This set is a complete joke.I watched the Star Wars blu rays last night. Skipped a few added scenes and was happy."
5,Star Wars Trilogy Review,"I would highly recommend this product to any Star Wars lover. The Digital Remastering makes the series seem like brand new, and the audio is great, too. I'm definitely going to get my money's worth out of this purchase."
3,Thank God for Laserdisc,"My friends laughed at me 10 years ago when I bought a Laserdisc player. And, yeah, I hardly ever use it now that I have DVD's. However, George Lucas released the trilogy AS IS on Laserdisc. No new effects, only remastered for digital. One of my projects is to transfer the Laserdiscs to DVD. I want to watch the ""analogue"" version, not the ""digital"" versions Lucas wants us to see."
1,I'd like to see the originals please,The special editions are fine... but srsly. You guys. I want to see a fantastic bluray version of the original films I watched when I was a kid. Why is that so hard?
1,Contemptously poor treatment of classic films,"As others have said, Amazon has merged the reviews with the 2006 dvds, so don't be fooled by the positive revews.This release is plagued with a host of technical problems, and ever more dire, with needless and laughable revisions. It's bad enough that the blacks are crushed, the lightsabers haven't been fixed (save for maybe 2 shots), audio errors from the 2004 set remain, there are weird color casts, etc, but adding insult to injury by adding the NNOOOOOOOOO!!!, obi's howl, and adding all of the other pointless revisions shows a stunning level of mistreatment for some of the most important films in cinema history. With a fraction of the money used to revisit and change the films they could have been *easily* restored the theatrical versions as well, and released them along side this one. This release should have been more, the films deserve it."
1,Why?!,"Why does George Lucas insist on not listening to his fans??? First it's Jarjar, and now this....... Would it be so hard to make a box set with the original movies in it? Why does Lucas keep making stupid mistakes? The trilogy should be watched with the original footage. Who wants to see those stupid extra scenes...they don't even look good. Jabba becomes a sissy. The computer animation they added looks terrible - it looks so out of place. The dancers in Jabba's place look STUPID!!!! What a let down. Probably won't even buy the trilogy now. Boo hoo! Smarten up Lucas!!!"
1,Lucas and his Bloated Ego Ruined Star Wars,"I will not purchase this or anything else with George Lucas' name on it, until the Original Star Wars, not the pompus, sickening self-important exercise in revisionism that is the Special Edition, becomes available.I don't know about the rest of you, but I fell in love with Star Wars the first time I saw it, and I was not happy with the Special Edition, where Greedo fired first, there were Dewback lizards roaming everywhere, and the band at Jabba's palace were ludicrous renderings of CGI tech.Until Lucas gives me the original, he will never see another cent from me.And the hypocrite even has the gall to say that the 3 Stooges shouldn't be colorized? Lucas is a vile, self-serving sell out. I did not watch Episodes 1 or 2, and I will not be watching 3."
1,Special Edition... Ha give me the originals thankyou very mu,Special Edition... Ha give me the originals thankyou very much.George Lucas forgot how to make movies... as seen by the new ones.
3,A bittersweet arrival,"Bittersweet because we at last get to see the first three movies in DVD glory- but they remain the largely unnecessarily doctored ""special editions"". Aside from the restoration of the meeting between Solo and Jabba on Tatooine in ""A New Hope"", the changes in the special edition are a waste of money and time... others mention Greedo shooting first- but personally, I think the singing muppet at Jabbas Palace in ""Return of the Jedi"" best embodies the pointlessness of the ""special edition"".One of Lucas' biggest problems with his later films is he does things because he can... big budgets give way to bigger special effects at the expense of a good story. So it goes in the ""special edition"" of the original films.And yet, as a loyal fan, I must own it.... truly a legacy of shame :-)"
5,Master OF The Rare LASERDISCs MOVIES.,"I have STARWARS Trilogy The LASERDISC Special Edition Remastered Boxset,And I bought the WS DVD Boxset too,One of my Favorite Movies :)"
4,Waiting for the 3D Version,Ok I broke down and bought the Blu-Ray version of the original trilogy and must admit it looked very good. I have unaltered versions in Laser Disc and VHS but we will never see it in Blu-Ray being that the huge demand would cannibalize the altered version plus the high quality video would ultimately lead to overseas bootlegging of the movies cutting more into Lucas' earnings. Not a good business move but I will most definitely pay top dollar for a limited edition run.
1,The Dark Side of the Force,"Duped again! I saw the original artwork on the cover and RAN to the shelf at my local big-box-mart with excitement thinking that we FINALLY had the ORIGINAL, un-edited trilogy. There was nothing written on the box to confirm that though, so I was naturally skeptical. I came here to check it out and I was right. Same Special Edition set that was released just recently, only without the bonus disc. Lame Lame Lame. In fact I looked around for the other set and it was marked down to the same price as this one. Crazy. Makes no sense at all to the fans to even consider buying this. I was hoping to finally unplug the old Laserdisc player and unload some of those gigantic discs. Hear our pleas George!"
3,Great video....poor audio on SW4,"I played Star Wars 4 last night on my home theater system. The audio mix for the Digital EX track was really poor. Why would one put laser fire through the center speaker??? Also, there are points where the variance in sound (from characters speaking to fight scenes) is enormous. To hear the characters, I have to turn up the sound..until a cruiser somes into the scene.So when will Lucas and company provide us with a replacement disk??"
5,Please...,"I would like to say first, you didn't create the movie, all this was Lucas's choice. The changes are very minor, and it some of it makes the movies better.I have been a star wars fan since I was a kid, and I was going to wait for a six movie box set to come out, but I couldn't wait so I went ahead and bought it. All three dvds are great and the bonus disc is awesome. I learned so much off this, and there is some really interesting information on that disc too.So if your a star wars fan, you must go out and buy this. Throw yourself a nice Star Wars marathon with some friends."
2,relive the zing,"today I went to visit Morty in the home. I took him this collection of Star Wars as I remember he likes captain kirk. We have to watch a movie during his prescribed one hour sitz bath. I am so glad I brought this movie for Morty to watch. It made Morty a little frisky to see that princess gal, he wanted to get into my groceries, hee hee hee..."
4,BLURAY,WHEN WATCHING AN OLDER MOVIE ON BLURAY ITS JUST A LITTLE BETTER THAN DVD... BUT A GOOD COMPONENT TO YOUR STARWARS COLLECTION
5,yoyoyoyo,"All 3 movies were GREAT! These movies are classics, and are for any one who likes fantasy things. I saw that this one is better than the 'original' ones, becuase they added a whole lot more in the special edition one. So the only thing left to say is: This is an amazing story fit into 3 great tapes."
5,The Box Set is the Best!!,"Baby Boomers gotta have the Box Set. Darth Vader, C3PO, R2D2, Yoda, Obi Wan, Han, everbody looks much better digitally remastered. It is part of ""Our Generation."" You simply must own this set. It is a part of our heritage."
1,George Lucas' endorsement of piracy,"The edits and all of the ""Special Edition"" parts in this movie are garbage. I ended up getting ripped copies of the LaserDisc version since he refuses to accept money for what I'm willing to pay for. Good job, Georgie."
1,Give us the Original - No CGI,"Agreed! Nor will I buy the ""enhanced"" version of the original Star Wars trilogy. Release the ORIGINAL theatrical version of those three movies on Blu-Ray, and I'll pre-order the moment I know they're available. Thanks to everyone for letting me know these are the ""enhanced"" versions as they are unacceptable."
2,Unbelievable,"Look is anyone really gonna care about continuity? We KNOW the originals were made in the 70s/80s, to put Hayden in ROTJ is pathetic! Because we know it's an add-on it takes so much from the realism of the film.The ewoks in the original were singing such a cute song! and the scene felt so intimate because we didn't see how the rest of the galaxy were celebrating- it was our heroes celebrating in a quiet, intimate place!Ugh I despise my new purchase! I can't believe I have to buy another bundle of DVDs when the originals come out."
1,trying to hard to connect,"the sound, and visual quality are great and its nice to have them on dvd, but the films have been altered further to create more continuity, including voice dubbing over boba fett's original voice, altered dialgoue between the emperor and Darth Vader with a new holographic emperor in empire. and the last scene in return of the jedi the original actor who played the spirit of anakin skywalker has been replaced with hayden Christensen. All of these things really alter the films for me and make it a far different trilogy than the one I grew up with. So I will say I'm not fond of the changes and additions."
4,Remember Laserdiscs,"These are three of the best movies ever produced, in their original form. The revamps to these movies wouldn't be a bad thing if they were integrated well. The primary disappointment with this box set is the absence of the original films. This means that my Laserdisc set is still the definitive star wars set. They could have easily transferred these over to DVD with minimal cost as they do include commentary. The only downside to the Laserdisc set is that it is 16 sides. Sigh..."
1,No Originals,My dad says wait until the originals are out on DVD! This set is insulting to our intelligence!
1,Rating manipulation -- avg = 3.776,"I took the time to calculate the true average of the reviews here after reading Skullchrist's review below dated August 4, 2004. It is actually very easy and takes no time (you just have to show all the 1 star reviews, then 2 star, etc.). Anyway, here's the breakdown:1 star reviews: 183, 2 star reviews: 36, 3 star reviews: 67, 4 star reviews: 78, 5 star reviews: 498. Total number: 862.Calculation: (1*183)+(2*36)+(3*67)+(4*78)+(5*498)=3258.3258/862 = 3.779582366...I'm giving it one star because I too would like the option of having the original and the ""special editions"" in one set. After this review the average would be:3259/863 = 3.7763615295...So, 4 out of 5 is just about right, Skullchrist; no rating manipulations."
1,epic fail,I give up on Star Wars. Whatever version i have in the house is the one I'l stick with. and some day SOMEDAY I'll pull out my original VHS copies to show the kids what this all REALLY was.[...]
3,Burning out on Star Wars,"I was up in the air about buying this set. I already own the movies on DVD. Then upgraditus hit me and I decided to buy the original trilogy on Blu-ray. I refuse to upgrade the prequel trilogy as I think the story and acting is awful. I owned star wars on VHS, Laserdisc, DVD and now Blu-ray. The picture and audio quality is a great improvement over dvd, however it's just not top tier reference quality anymore. I don't mind most of the changes Lucas has made but at the same time I don't understand why they needed to be done. I saw these movies in the theater when they first came out. Back when going out to see a movie was something special.I'm at the point where I'm just burned out. I've seen these movies so many times they aren't special to me anymore. I watched the whole trilogy and now it will probably not get watched again for a long time. If anything the price of the set is a bargain at $40.00"
2,Poor shipping practices.,"I received this item as a gift as it was on my wish list.When it arrived it had been shipped in a padded envelope and one corner of the item was significantly crushed.I returned it as damaged and wrote in the comments ""perhaps if the item were shipped in a box rather than an envelope it would have prevented the damage from occurring"".When I received the replacement it did arrive in a box, however, almost as if to be sarcastic, they didn't put any packing material in the box to prevent the item from bouncing around inside of it. Subsequently a corner of the replacement item was crushed as well although not as predominantly.If the appearance of the box is of concern to you, I would suggest purchasing from a walk-in retailer. After receiving this set from here, I opted to buy the prequel at such a retailer."
3,Lucas money making scheme,"Ok.. guys!Remember when George Lucas released the VHS in a trilogy..I had to purchase that, then he came out with the updated version. I got sucked into buying that as well... There goes over $100.00 HARD erned money.Then he releases this DVD trilogy.My guess is that he will again re-lease another version... maybe with more stuff in it.Then when Parts I,II,III are done..He will release part III, then... He will release 1-3 Trilogy months after.Then a year down the road.. I bet he will release the Collectors set VOLUMES 1-6 ""ALL in one boxed set...with x-tras and free this and free that...By the time we Star Wars Fans have gotten the best we can get...We probably would have spent about $500.00 hard erned bucks (PER HOUSEHOLD) that's Billions to George Lucas pocket....What do you guys think....It is a great movie... but do you folks think we should just wait for the COMPLETE SAGA Parts 1-6 in one colletor boxed set?You decide!RJ"
3,"It's Star Wars, but....","I own both the widescreen originals (in the box set) and the widescreen special editions and just watched them back to back to compare them. Everybody comments on Greedo shooting first (which IS horrible), but what about the terrible CGI of Jabba (in IV), or Luke's ""scream"" in V (when he's going down the chute), the BORING shots of Mos Eisley (IV), the omission of the original Ewok song (VI). We all grew up with the classic trilogy, and i think it's a BIG mistake not to issue them on DVD. Lucas would definately make some great extra cash by releasing these. I for one will NOT buy these ""special editions"", as long as my VHS tapes survive, which they still have for years."
2,More changes by Lucas,"I love Star Wars, the original that is. When the special editions came out, with the new scenes, I thought some were good (extended Death Star sequence, background windows in Cloud City), some were unneccessary (what was with that sequence with the band in Jabba's palace in ROTJ?) and some were just awful (Greedo shoots first ?!? Han steps on Jabba's tail?!?!) Most of these I just ignored; but know Lucas is changing even more. At the end of ROTJ when Obi-wan's, Yoda's and Anakin's ghosts sit and watch the Ewok celebration, now they are removing the actor who played Anakin in the original and replacing him with the kid from the prequels. What the heck?? What more can Lucas do to eviscerate these movies. Needless to say I won't being buying these, instead I'll burn my old VHS copies to DVD and enjoy the original series at its best."
1,"WHAT WE WANT, its really not that hard to figure out","Mr.Lucas,Please release the following:The Original Trilogy - the original Theatrical Cuts on DVD and or Blu Ray.REMASTERED, CLEANED UP, whatever, Anamorphic etc.Thank You,Your Fans (the few that are left)"
2,POINTLESS!!!,"I LOVE THE STAR WARS MOVIE'S BUT HERE'S A THOUGHT. WHY DOESN'T GEORGE LUCAS (OR WHOMEVER) RELEASE A SET WITH THE ENTIRE SERIES INCLUDING THE PHANTOM MENNACE, ATTACK OF THE CLONES AND REVENGE OF THE SITH???"
1,Can we have the Originals PLEASE!,Great movies... but GL screwed with the classics.It's like reworking Lawrence of Arabia or Ben HurShame on him
1,WHY?,What is the point? Why is Lucas re-re-re-re-re-releasing the same three movies in this pathetic format AGAIN? I refuse to buy these simply because of the inferior quality of VHS. Get your act together Lucas and release these on DVD.
5,The Force is strong in this one - look for the easter eggs,"No, these are not ""the originals,"" but honestly, I am not a purist. I love it all, and the more Star Wars the better for me.This DVD collection is absolutley amazing. In comparing the original in-theatre teaser trailers (included on the special features disk and look awful - scratches, pops and all) to the beautiful images in the films, I can only imagine how painstaking it must have been to clean these classics up frame by frame.The results are breathtaking, and the sound is incredible. Not to mention that having them on DVD is just so convenient - no fast forward or rewind issues, etc.There are also several ""easter eggs"" or hidden features on the bonus disk - most notibly the hidden ""gag reel"" or outakes from the films. A quick search online will give you the instructions for accessing them.Highly recommended - a must have for any fan."
2,Big Disappointment,"Not what I was wanting or expecting. Yes, you get the original, un re-mastered version on one side, and the newly re-mastered on the other side. Don't get me wrong, the re-mastered version looks amazing, EXCEPT it has the deleted/additional scenes in it that weren't in the original. I think the deleted addional scenes are stupid and ruin the films. George Lucas has become an expert at ruining his classic works of art with the new trilogy as well. So yeah, I may still have the original version on one side, but it's not remastered and it looks like I'm watching it from a VHS. Why they couldn't just take the re-mastered version and cut out the stupid scenes is beyond me. I was so excited for this to come out....what a bummer"
3,Movies are Great - but the Jewel Cases Damage DVD's,"The extremely slim jewel cases for the DVD's have a very inflexible mechanism that holds the DVD's in place. So when you try to take one out, they start to chip away at the inside ring of the DVD's. We've only taken A New Hope out 2X, and already this is becoming an issue.There isn't much choice in versions here, but you might want to get some cheap DVD sleeves of your own to house the series in."
4,Entertains even today's children,"The reviews had me reluctant to spend a mere $25 on this classic trilogy. It's a shame I came that close to NOT treating myself (decades later) and my kids to the Star Wars experience. Yes, the quality is lower than one expects from today's DVDs, but such is the quality of that era's movie productions compared to today's. As one reviewer stated, it's still better than VHS.I was about my son's age when Star Wars came out in the theater. It was something special to see him express the same enthusiasm and interest in these stories. We watched the original theatrical version, since that is what I remember seeing, but I imagine the 2nd time through we'll watch the special edition just to see what changed (and to experience the better surround sound encoding).Seeing the original trilogy has renewed my interest in the prequel trilogy, which I am going to order now. I lost interest after seeing episode I (one), but my son wants to see them, and admittedly, so do I."
3,Lousy Cases,"Movies are great. Cases are totally cheap-o garbage. On the other hand, all they do is sit on a shelf . . ."
3,5 stars for the ORIGINAL series - 1 star for these DVDs,"I want to agree with most of the reviews here.The original series was excellent, and I do not like all the changes and extra CGI George Lucas added. I own a set of LaserDiscs of the series AFTER remastering and BEFORE all the changes, and I will not be replacing them until a proper version of the DVDs, with the original effects and scenes exists.However, if we go by Mr. Lucas' track record on Episodes I & II (which I thought were pretty awful movies) he has lost touch with his audience and can't imagine why everyone doesn't like his ""improvements"" He is lost in a world of CGI for CGI's sake!So, 5 stars for the original series, and 1 for this DVD set with the altered versions."
1,The worst version of the greatest films,"Unreal. I finally get around to watching and it's NOT the original but instead I have paid nearly $100.00 for the awful, horrible, ""weirdly inserted crappy updates"" special effect version. I would never have paid ANY money for this crapfest. It's as if Jar Jar has walked onto the damn set. It's awful and totally ruining the whole experience. I WILL be returning. UNWATCHABLE.Gross. Thanks for the false advertising butt-wads."
4,good price for the set,Bought this for a friend who is a HUGE star wars fan and he loves all the bonus materials dvds. Makes a great gift.
5,If I was a critic I would rate this movie on top of the char,"These movies mix comedy,action, and romance together. Which I think is very fantastic! Because some movies just have action and nothing else. It makes the movie a whole lot enjoy able. I reccomend everyone little or big watch this movie!! Very,Very,Very...GOOD movie!!"
3,Why didn't the nerds confirm?!?!,"I just read an interview with George Lucas confirming that these are the special edition and not the original trilogy. I wish that had been disclosed before my preorder. The restored graphics are great, the new CGI stuff looks like a video game. Also, the jabba stuff is recycled because he couldn't make it the first time around so it was worked in later. With all due respect to an artist, once it is out and observed, I feel that you lose the right to tinker. Imagine if Paul McCartney took Hey Jude out of print and replaced it with a version featuring synthesizers and a speaking verse along with a chorus of seal trumpeters. This is most disturbing indeed."
5,"So it's not THE original trilogy, who cares?","I just recently bought this box set, and so far, I think that it's awesome. It's nice to have the movies in widescreen, and the picture and sound transfer is amazing. The movies really don't like they were released over twenty years ago at all, it's sweet. As for the changes made to the movies themselves, who cares? Sure, they aren't THE original movies, but I'm not going to whine about it like so many devoted hardcore fans of the movies have been since this set was released. Besides, this is exactly how Lucas wanted the movies to be, so if they were really such devoted fans, they would be happy about that. Regardless, I think the Star Wars DVD set is definitely worth buying, and the changes made to the movies aren't a big deal, so just get over them and buy it already, because it's sweet!"
1,No more...,"I'll not give a penny for this release. George Lucas made an horrible work with episodes I and II and maybe the third one would be the same if not worse.If you, George, don't release the ORIGINAL trilogy you'll not get a single buck from me.Maybe a real director like Spielberg or Peter Jackson can remake the first trilogy to fix what you damaged, you just destroyed the whole story, the whole magic of the original 70's releases. And with this special edition release you also damaged the unique magic present on the original films. George, you don't deserve any more money from star wars fans."
1,You in here for some Star Wars? Man this is some !@#$!!@#%!,"George Lucas.... Boo this man!I have very fond memories as a kid watching Star Wars. I've easily watched the first trilogy hundreds of times. This Blu-ray is packed with garbage such as lame CGI musicals, changed voices, Han shooting second, Darth Vader screaming NOOOOO!!! at the climax (which might be appropriate in this case)... and the last straw.... the VERY LAST STRAW... Hayden Christensen now appears at the end of Return of the Jedi replacing Sebastian Shaw... just to remind you how badly you've just been messed with for the past decade.You can shell out money for some hacked up crap that they slap a picture of Darth Vader on it and call it Star Wars: The Original Trilogy, I'll wait until either Lucas comes to his senses or until the next ""rights holders"" decide to finally include the ""original"" theatrical release."
1,This is not the trilogy I fell in love with!!!,"I'm sure you've read other reviews that agree with me, so I'm not going to go into detail about everything that was totally wrong with these versions. For the star wars nerds out there who support these versions and those horrible prequels, let me ask you something. Say hypotheticly, goer verbinski (director of ""pirates of the caribbean"") decides to make a prequel of that trilogy and he hires Ashton Kutcher to play jack sparrow, he then decides that the prequel would ""mesh"" better with the original trilogy if johnny depp wasn't in them, so he decides to replace johnny depp in the original movies with ashton kutcher. Then, Gore decides that he doesn't want to seem ""racist"" so he hires a black woman to replace kiera knightly in the original trilogy...now, let me ask you...would you be happy with that?"
3,StarWars,"My brother got me started on StarWars when I was probably 6yrs of age and Now I am 18 and I still love starwars, but This DVD set kinda blows. I actually went to several Half Price Book stores just so I can find The Original unrestored releases of the New Hope, empire strikes back, and return of the jedi.I think George Lucas is a brilliant writer and Director but he is too much of a perfectionist. He even went as far as to take out the Original Anakin Skywalker from the ending of Return OF the Jedi and replaced him with Anakin from Episode 2.I like the fact that the sound and picture have been restored.And That this set include a 4th disk which contains behind the scenes material.What I started to do was transfer my original unrestored starwars movies over to DVD's.This is the hardware that i have that lets me do it.Leadtek TV tunerPlextor DVD RW driveand a big harddrive"
2,Might be worth a look,"While I agree that having this trilogy on DVD finally with all of the new features (not new effects) and extras is probably a good move for star wars fans, I can't say I am excited about the release the way I wanted to be. Episodes I and II were a huge disappointment and further brought to light how Lucas ruined the original 3 with the re-release. It is worth it for anyone to get a good laserdisk copy of the original movies and get someone that loves them to sample it down to DVD format. Laserdisk was great quality and with the affordable HD video editing software out there today, a good DVD of the orignal 3 can be made. There are probably even people selling the orignal releases somewhere out there.I am not a fanatic at all. Lucas really did ruin his creation and reputation. Not quite as bad as Michael Jackson, but close. I am a real-world casual movie lover and this is just bad."
1,Originals please,"I agree with the sentiments here. George, the ORIGINALS WITH 5.1 surround sound mixes. STOP being such a cry baby about how much you hate the originals and realize your FANS are the ones who LOVE them so much.After all, without the FANS, you'd just have had another THX1138 on your hands as far as popularity goes...1 star only until you correct your error of a lifetime."
5,star wars trilogy,"In my opinion, the Return Of The Jedi, where Darth Vader fights Luke Skywalker is the best one, but all 3 of them are pretty neat."
5,Can't Wait,"I can't wait to finally be immersed in the full star wars experience on dvd.and i have one thing to say to all of you people who are bitching about it not be the original version. can't you all remember what was said about 10 times when the original trilogy was released on vhs in 1995?? ""This will be your chance to own the original Star Wars trilogy...ONE LAST TIME"" ...what don't you all understand about that? George told you nearly 10 years ago that you wouldn't see the original trilogy on dvd ever. so get over it. i think he'd be selling out as an artist if he was releasing the original just to satisfy part of the audience.it's gonna be awesome! better sound, better picture, awesome story! how can you go wrong? even old emperor monkey-eyes will be gone!"
1,Not Easy To Rate My Favorite Movie So Low,I was watching the new DVDs and I've finally had enough of Lucas's tinkering. I enjoyed the special editions in the movie theater because I thought it was nice to see something different. Now I realize I will have to live with them forever as being the Star Wars. I will always be disctracted by the new scenes and the movies will never be the same. Tinkering with something that was great does not make it better. I'm sure you can find a list of differences if you want to look for what Lucas has changed. It just does not make the movie better.
1,Major disappointment,"This set was suppose to be good, it had potential. But a tweaked digital master from 2004 can't do any wonders.And that's not the worst. It's Lucas's tinkering with the movies with every release. This is the 3rd homevideo release since the Special Editions came out in -97, and the movies had been quite different every time.Enough is enough."
1,Why has the rating gone up?,"A few days ago, the overall rating for this was 2 stars. There have been nothing but one star reviews since then. Now, all of a sudden, it's up to 3 and a half, even though 99% of the reviews are one star due to Lucas' stubbornness. Looks like Lucas' goons are at it again."
2,George Lucas please die.,"George Lucas please die, so that the smart people in your company can take control and make the right choices for the maximum profits and bring out the first original triogy on BLU. They know that continuing the Star Wars films is money in the bank, and good business, not counting the support of a loyal fan base. We are all tired of your crappy lies about Star Wars, the original unedited theatrical releases coming to BLU and getting everything but. George you don't care about any of your fans, unless they are buying all your crap. What ever happened to the third set of trilogies that make up the trilogy of trilogies, huh? You continue to lie about every aspect of your films and promises that you have made, PLEASE JUST DIE ALREADY."
1,I wonder what goes on in Lucas' mind.,"Im rating this DVD set a 1, not the Star Wars movies, which obviously, rate a 5. Lucas thought it'd be fun to go back and see how much more he could ruin in the movies that he didnt already mess up in the special edition. I bought these thinking I was going to get the original, or at the worst, the special edition. In fact, it got even WORSE than that. He edited MORE things, totally messing up the movie. The longer I watched, the more I wanted to take out the dvd and snap it in two. I hope someday he realizes that we just want to see the original movies, not the abominations he has turned them into."
1,No interest.,"I have no interest in the Special Edition, and I refuse to be those suckers who fall for it every format change because they feel there it's the best they can get. I won't soil the memory of the real original trilogy by watching these knock-offs."
1,This release is INSULTING,"Why George Lucas? WHY?!?!?!?!?!?!Why would you DO THIS?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?! Your new release is insulting. Just leave the films alone!The most insulting part is the editing of the most CLIMATIC scene of the trilogy, where Luke removes Darth's helmet. Lo and behold George clown edited out Shaw and stuck Hayden in. I wanted to smash the hell out of the TV.George Lucas should not be allowed to touch his original masterpieces. The DVDs went immeditaly into the basement, never to be touched again."
5,Why don't you cry MORE about it?,"cry cry cry cry cry cry. greedo shooting ruined the whole trilogy. han talking to jabba ruined star wars forever. ""help me, i am little crybaby."" whaaa whaaaa whhaaaaa whaaa. i don't think that the star wars original trilogy needs to be reviewed unless you have lived in a cave for the past 25 years; the movies speak for themselves. see i don't cry because i workout a lot. also, i am a REAL man. for those of you who can't help but cry may i make a suggestion to you: don't buy the dvd box set. watch your original release vhs. practice consumerism. hurt lucas in the wallet. these movies are hella good."
1,Snooze Control To Major Tom,This movie proves once and for all why sci fi is so overated.Acting is bad mmmkay and Lucas seems unimaginative
1,Fans unite for original Star Wars - Remember Gladiator!,"Just like everyone else here has stated, I will not be buying the bluray set unless the original un-altered versions are included. Remember what happened with the original release of Gladiator Bluray; it was crap, however due to overwhelming dissatisfaction from the fans, the studio was forced to re-release a proper version.Hopefully the same can be done with this trilogy that we all love and want to see properly on bluray."
1,Buyer Beware!,"The packaging falsely states that these are ""the classic films"". The films being sold in this trilogy are updated versions of the ""Special Editions"" that were released in 1997, NOT the original theatrical classics as the packaging states. Very deceiving and shameful marketing!"
1,Give us the originals on DVD!,"If you want to see Star Wars, and you own the ORIGINALS on VHS, don't buy this. George Luca$ was once a good film-maker, and his movies began to stink because all he cares about now is BIG BUX! I'm not really a die-hard star wars fan, but George Lucas shouldn't have digitally altered your his films! Everything is CGI! I'm fine with PUPPETS and guys in costumes! George Lucas even admits rather have done an all-CGI CARTOON instead. I hope you are reading this, Luca$! Keep your VIDEOS if you have them... still."
3,Possible Glitch on Ep 4,"According to thedigitalbits.com, viewers have been reporting at least one technical glitch on ""A New Hope"". One of Tarkin's lines is rather garbled, apparently. Additionally, it has been noted that the surround channels are reversed for at least some of the film, and the trumpet fanfare when the rebels attack the Death Star is buried in the mix.Lucasfilm has issued a statement denying any snafus and that any changes in the audio are intentional. The problem with Tarkin's speech (asking which planet should he choose) would belie this though."
1,Stop messing with the originals!!,"Star Wars was great. Since Lucas had to edit his movies for no good reason, these movies are no longer the ""real"" Star Wars. I'm giving these impostor movies 1 star. The originals I would give 4, but not these impostors."
1,No. No. No sale!,Sorry.. No behind the scenes. No Deleted scenes. No extra footage. No documentaries. NO original theatrical versions? I swear it's not that hard to make a product people actually want! Just listen to all the fans and give them what they are clamoring for! I will not be buying this. If you are going to sell me something I've already purchased half a dozen different times over the years at least sell me the version I want to own.
1,An absolute joke,"It would be no big deal if the original versions were actually included, but the fact they aren't just makes this inexcusable."
1,Yours fans/customers deserve better,"The Butcher of a galaxy far, far away strikes back as George Lucas continues to release version after version of the movies we loved as children and have grown to loathe as adults due to his constant (over)tinkering. Skip this noise and watch instead the South Park episode titled Free Hat where the show skewers Lucas for ruining the films and why it's NOT his right as an artist to make things up as he goes along.""Free Hat, free Hat, free Hat!"""
2,Never Watched,"I never even took the DVDs out of the cases. Somewhere before the shipping process the 3rd case (ROTJ) was cut with a knife. I returned it the next day. I'm sure it's a fine product, these things happen, but still..."
1,terrible,"I am amoung the unfortunate millions who have been subjected to this ""trilogy"". to think of three worse movies would take some time. at over two hours each this is more than six hours of bordem. the special effects for the year this was made were pretty impressive, but it doesn't save the poor acting, terrible script or crusty plot. i wont go on forever with this, only because i know you all have seen these awful movies, and probably agree with me, so i wont waste your time."
3,the movies are good this box set is not,I think Star Wars is fun but why so little extras. The fans wants more then one bonus disc. Don't buy this poor and ugly box set.
1,Disappointed to say the least.,I cannot endorse this revision of history any longer. I am truly sorry I bought the DVD's. This is a turning point for me. I've bought all of them. Every version on every video format. I don't even like the Special Editions and I bought them in 2006 just to have the crappy laserdisc port of the originals. Never again. Even if they release the unaltered films at this point I'm not sure I could even get behind it again just because of what this company has done to it's fanbase.
5,MASTERPIECE,"One of the greatest movies of all time. If you don't like it, you have to at least respect it for it's greatness.The plot is brilliant, the acting is good, and the special effects are amazing for their date and age."
1,"George Lucas, May he never touch the Indiana Jones trilogy","I would rather use my computer, and burn copies of my old videos onto DVD than buy something I never wanted and absolutely despise. Of course, the DVD collection will make Billions more for Lucas Film, forcing him to direct more attrocities, or add special effects to other great movies. Why doesn't he go back to American Graffiti and add some more tire smoke. Could improve my viewing pleasure, a little.I mean i can't wait to stand in line next MAy for the Blockbuster finaly, and clap and applaud and cheer that he has finished destroying the best work he ever did.That is if I don't fall asleep, during the riviting dialogue with utter Brilliant Direction!"
1,Film history desecrated again!,"Yet again, the original ORIGINAL Trilogy is omitted from this set in favour of the ""special"" edition with even more contemptible changes this time. The climax to the entire saga is ruined when Darth Vader screams ""NOOOOOO!"" in the previously silent and very emotional redemption scene. If you saw a clip of this before buying this set, you'd be forgiven for thinking it was an amateur youtube parody, but it's not. There are many more changes than this, but one can look these up with a quick search. All Lucasfilm needs to do is release both versions in the same set and noone will have any complaints. Ridley Scott did it with blade runner, including 4 different cuts of the film.If people want a decent release, vote with your wallets and don't buy this. If people want to see the kind of updates and restorations that there ought to have been, google 'adywan' and you'll see we've been cheated and sold inferior versions."
3,A Case Full of Disappointment,"Like many of you I bought this particular set for the original releases of the films. And it turns out they're presented in a widescreen 4:3 format. Bad description, but basically on my widescreen TV the film occupies a small rectangle somewhere in the middle, surrounded by large black bars. It's being returned. And, I hate to say it, there may or may not be pirated versions of the originals you can download online that are of a much higher quality."
5,awesome,"its been years since i watched any of the original trilogy, and when i saw the amazing deal for this boxed set, i jumped on it. glad i did! movies are great (could have used some behind-the-scenes featurettes, but whatevs), and i remember now why they are far superior to the new trilogy.YES."
1,Great movies- bad versions,"I would buy this set if they included the original versions of the films. The versions included here are filled with overly cute crap, had have been sanitized for your protection (like the stupid change in the confrontation between Han and Greedo).Go to e-bay and buy the videodisc and a videodisk player, and enjoy the original films.BTW: I am not opposed to making some changing and cleaning up the effects, but I am opposed to stupid, pointless changes."
1,Don't touch a classic!,Future generations will now be unable to see the original versions. The changes made for these versions are NOT for the better.Fx.: In the famous scene in the bar Greedo get's the first shot against Han Solo (and misses at a distance of one yard!!) so that Han Solo political correctly doesn't shoot before being shot at himself! George Lucas must have lost his marbels changing a great scene like that!
5,A Must Have Series !!,"We enjoyed the first (1st) set so much, we wore them out. Liked the changes (additions)."
2,Star Wars Trilogy (Widescreen Edition) VHS,"While I truly believe that these are three of the best films ever made, this video release serves little or no purpose aside from sucking more money from fans. The Star Wars Trilogy has been released in more different editions than any other movie series, and this release is being made only to capitalize on the excitement for Episode II (the 10 minutes of bonus material previously unreleased). I believe that Lucasfilm should ""double their efforts"" to produce DVD editions of these films, rather than produce countless video editions while claiming they have no time to spend on DVD projects."
2,How much money can you milk from one good idea?!,"This is the problem that George Lucas's staff has been working with for the past couple of years. Here's one of the answers, Re-release the same films... again and the people will buy them... again. Originally, I was on-board and gung ho for all of these movies, but geez!And- WHY can't we get the ORIGINAL, digitally enhanced, but not ALTERED on DVD? I have the VHS tapes that were released before the three newest films, and as much as I can't stand the poor quality, I will not give another dime to these movies. Just because the newest films have new actors, why do we have to ignore the work of the actors that gave us the originals?Don't buy these movies. It's simply a way to get your money. Besides, like a previous reviewer said- they'll be re-re-released again anyway... Rent em from Blockbuster."
1,Forget the Special Editions.,Don't give any more money to this man. Buy the used digitally remastered VHS version of the original trilogy. It looks and sounds great and doesn't have any of those added on special effects.
5,Simply the best of the best,"The Star Wars Trilogy. No movie series, with the exception perhaps of the James Bond movies, can even compare with Star Wars when it comes to popularity. And Lucas tells a superb story, following the model of the heroic quest, and using many long-overlooked literary techniques. The charcters have personality, even those who never speak a single word. The three heroes of the trilogy all fill in each others weak points, making the group stronger as a whole. And Star Wars is so much a part of popular society that anyone who hasn't seen the films might be missing a lot. If you haven't seen them, or don't own them, at the very least, see this set. Or better yet, buy it now, while we fans wait for the Flanneled one to release the Trilogy on DVD."
2,Special Features vs. Crappy Changes,"bottom line the changes suck. I origionally saw Star Wars with the re-release of the ""SE"" versions in the 90's. Now. I also own a 3 movie box set of the origional versions. I like them better. They flow better, the acting and the storytelling was excellent. Plus, my favorite music in the entire saga, except for perhaps Duel of the Fates, is the ""yub yub"" song thing at the end of ROTJ. Do yourself a favor and go on E-bay and get the origional version. The special features were not worth the money, considering that if I just want to watch the movie, I still prefer to see the origional versions and deal w/ the VHS. If only Lucas would reach down, pull hard, and mabee he'll see the light of day again. Granted, putting in HC and Ian McDarmond was acceptable, as was the BoY fix. The rest was crap."
2,George---You are blowing it!!!,"True, it is just a movie, but a movie that we all loved and it defined a generation. How many of us dont get goosebumps when we revisit something from our childhoods, a toy,a movie, a song? But George keeps us from seeing the movie that we all loved as kids. What if Ray Harryhausen had decied to redo all of his classics just becasue the technology was better....no more King Kong, no more mighty Joe Young, no more Sinbad....what a shame that would be.George we all understand that it is your movie and you certainly have the right to alter it and change it however you like....but, by not giving us the original versions too....you are stealing some of the most cherished childhood memories of Star Wars truest fans."
5,"""Best Group of Movies Ever Made""",This was some of the best movies that I have ever saw. I do hope that the store gets more tapes.
5,Get your life back in balance,"I'm amazed this book is out of print!! I agree with comments of other readers. A wonderful book, with an abundance of simple techniques to help in developing focus, discipline, serenity. My copy is also dog-eared and I find myself re-reading chapters to ingrain messages. The Levey's are more accessible to me than some other authors in this genre (eg. Dyer, Williamson). Just a great book!!! Thank you, Joel and Michelle."
5,sjped,I ordered this cutting board even though the description did not indicate the size. Turned out it was perfect. I actually ordered two. The quality is the best I have ever seen as far as acrylic cutting boards go.
3,cutting board,"The cutting board would have been great but I was looking for a smooth surface, not tuxtured. I needed an 11"" X 15"" clear, smooth surface cutting board."
5,Great Lock - Deadbolts are a must have.,"This lock was a snap to install -- after I expanded the existing hole. Most newer steel doors come with holes but the hole in my door was just a tad too small. If you encounter this problem, some kind of grinding bit for a drill or similar rotary tool will come in handy in expanding the holes. The installation took about 20 minutes because of this, otherwise it would have been less than 5.The finish is very durable, and will not wear off or show where you touched the keypad. I installed the bright brass, and it does not show.If the idea that a pattern might be visible somehow is of concern to you, consider that each individual in your household can have their own code. Make sure you use most of the numbers. If you live alone, alternate between two codes. As simple as that."
5,Wonderful invention,I bought this as I have 3 latchkey kids who love to loose keys. It works like a dream. I installed it in 5 minutes and am by no means handy and it was easy to do. Definitely recommend for families. My husband will never need to take keys out of his pocket again since he also has keyless on his car! Wish I'd gotten one years ago!
5,Fantastic,"This product was easy to install, easy to program, and works flawlessly. I am very impressed and would recommend this lock to any and everyone."
4,"Well made, but ....",Ordered two of these locks and they are solid construction and easy to install and use. Problem is locks are not keyed the same so as a backup for battery failure must carry two keys. Called Schlage and they don't offer identical keyed sets but recommended going to a locksmith and having the pins in the tumbler reset.
5,Very good design,"I've had this for over 2 years with no complaints. As another reviewer mentioned, a key feature of this lock is that entering the correct combination energizes a release solenoid that allows you to turn the knob yourself(as opposed to using a drive motor to drive the bolt). That allows you to tell if the lock is binding if, say, the door has settled and should be a lot more dependable. My guess is that it will also allow the battery to last longer."
3,Dumb engineering...,"I purchased one of these locks to replace existing deadbolts (installed after 1994). The hole spacing requirement (center to center) for this Schlage electronic deadbolt is not compatible with doors which were drilled for a lockset and deadbolt combination. You need extra tools to complete this (clamps, 2-1/8 hole saw etc). Instead of a 10 minute install, this required a trip to store and 1h of work, half a day wasted. This is dumb engineering. They did not try or cared this on any existing doors. It works fine for now but not happy with the whole thing."
1,MISPRINT????,"I ordered this and was charged, now they told me I received the correct product, it was simply a misprint on Amazon. I think the company ""Alphacraze"" needs to learn its products before placing them for sale. I returned the product 2 weeks ago, and still have yet to see my $$$$. Ordered the correct adapter from Fuji film, costs a little more, but NO HASSLES from a reputable company!!! Amazon customer service was helpful in making a claim against Alphacraze and sharing my rights."
1,A self-inflicted wound.,"This book should be pulped. Maushart is entitled to her own interpretations of the literature but her analysis falls woefully short, first in her over-reliance upon feminist theories on gender oppression to explain poor or weak marriages; and second from her unwillingness to acknowledge the change happening around her. Maushart seems more of a woman with a grudge to bear than an author with a possibly important message. If her true stories were from the experiences of other women (indicating research), I, for one, might have been able to stomach her biased diatribe. Every choice comes down to a yes or no. Maushart twice said yes. If offered the choice again she should do some research before making a decision."
5,C is for Cookie,"I purchased this item as a holiday gift. Kept my nephews quite entertained through the rest of the afternoon. They made cookies and never got bored of informing us that they had already taken a bite out of them when we went to take one.Honestly, even the concept of already-chewed cookies is worth the cost of this item."
4,It's a shame this book is out of print ...,"... because it's a finely crafted, gracefully written first novel that showed a whole lot of promise for Wickersham back in the mid-90s. Maybe the nicest thing about the book is that, given a subject matter (young love on the rocks) that lends itself to sentimentality, and a location (small town New England) that lends itself to preciousness, Wickersham firmly rejects both tiresome flaws. I agree with the reviewer who said that the story upon which this book was based was strong enough on its own; but the birthing scene that ends the story has got to be the gutsiest, gnarliest, most unflinching portrayal of labor ever put down on paper. I hope we'll see more of Wickersham's work, if only so that this novel gets another chance to see the light of day."
4,Wonderful moisturizer,"I am a fan of Elizabeth Arden's Red Door perfume, so I have decided to try this moisturizer. I use it primarily for the hands and being that I live in midwest where winters are harsh, I am open to all products that can nourish the skin and keep them look young.Product is very rich and one only needs a small dab on both hands. Cream is very thick and it may feel sticky to some. For that reason, I prefer to use it in the evening and let it soak on my skin overnight. In the morning, skin is soft and smooth. Do not expect this product to have aromatherapy properties. It does smell like a petroleum which may not be appealing to some. But its healing properties and fair price are well worthed. Convenient packaging makes it easy to carry in a purse or pack for a trip. It is a kind of product that both men and women can use simply because it does not smell ""girly""."
5,Great CD & DVD,"This is the GREAT CD, and every song is good, and watching the dvd just enhances the cd when you listen to it. I felt like I was right there at the concert. These ladies are ""BAD"". I play the cd in the car and the dvd in the house. Keep it up ladies."
5,****Floacism Live****,"This is a great album. I think that Marsha (the Songstress) and Natalie (the Floacist) are a great pair. I have this album, and my brother turned me onto Soul. I occasionally watch the DVD that is included, and it is of the actual live concert. It is full of positive energy, and has a lot of songs that you will love, if you're an R&B/Soul-buff like me. It is so hard to choose a favorite song from this album, seriously. All of them are good, but if I had to choose one, I'd choose ""Hey You""."
3,Easy to please,"Bought it as a gift for my 2 year niece. She LOVES it! I hear she's ""doing hair"" everyday now :)"
4,Songs about life and love,"Songs about the joys of love and life are found throughout this CD. ""A Man is in Love"" is simply one of the sweetest songs about that state of being you'll find anywhere, and it's a rare occurrence to hear a man sing about love so simply without an accompaniment of pain and anguish. The CD is filled with many such little delights. Sometimes a bit too light-hearted for its own good, Room to Roam lacks the depth to be a great CD but it's still a great deal of fun."
1,"Complete nonsense, the work of an ill-informed crank","This book came free in the mail to many high school physics teachers several years ago; I have just begun to read it. Kenneth Salem's book is a classic example of too little knowledge is dangerous, the book tries to bridge phsyics and philosophy when it is so obvious that Mr. Salem has not appearantly had any training in either one. (The biography is so boastfull that you would think he would list his credentials). The book is riddled with arguements so ridiculus and disproved daily in chemistry, physics and in common electronic devices (ect.) at the reader would have to assume the Mr. Salem is a CRANK. Please take some advice from a real Physics don't buy books like this. I you want to learn physics go to an acredited college and start taking classes."
4,NO APPOINTMENT NECESSARY,"A dry climate is nice; a dry wine is lovely. Dry skin is aging, unattractive, and uncomfortable. Thank goodness for DERMAdoctor KP duty!Many of us are plagued by dry skin primarily in the nether regions (feet and hands). However, whether dry skin is confined to fingers and toes or covers from top to toe, this primo moisturizing therapy comes to the rescue.Using this effective fragrance free cream in the morning and evening brings about lovely results - softer, smoother hands and feet.Among the ingredients that make KP duty both a treat and a treatment are Glycolic Acid, Japanese Green Tea, Urea, Dimethicone, and many other therapeutic additions. All combine to nourish skin while remaining non-irritating and allergy tested.For me, a great advantage of the Internet is that this doctor is always in. Highly recommended."
3,"Smoother skin, but redness remains","I've almost finished my first tube of KP, and while my arms are smoother and softer than they've ever been, I can't get rid of the redness. I'm not sure if that's what this lotion is intended to do, but after reading some of the reviews, I thought maybe that'd be my results as well. Good stuff, but I'm not sure I'll buy it again. Might try a cheap alpha hydroxy lotion from the grocery store, as another reviewer suggested."
2,"Good product but overpriced, try ammonium lactate lotion instead","KP Duty works great. But my doctor recommend Ammonium Lactate Lotion 12%, which is over the counter. It works the same for me, at a fraction of the price and twice the size. It's a better deal."
2,"Did not work for me, but worth a try...","This product seemed to have worked for other readers, but I used it for month and about 3/4 of the content and it did not take care of my arm bumps. I think its still worth a try, but buy it at Sephora since they have a customer satisfaction guarantee (even pass 30 days)."
1,didnt work for a month of use,been using it for a month and i dont see a difference. i dont like it. maybe ill try buying some more
3,"Very detailed, but not always accurate","We purchased this book in preparation for a trip to Aspen with our children (one 4 year-old and 6-month old twins) in August 2008. We found the range of hikes helpful, although I was able to find additional information about a wide range of other hikes that might have been appropriate online. My wife was doing most of the guide-holding and route-finding and sometimes she found the level of detail of trail descriptions a bit annoying. One of the described hikes in Snowmass (East Snowmass Creek) was based on riding 2 ski lifts--which we thought would be perfect for getting our 4 year-old hiking up at mountain top--but actually only one of the lifts was operational during the summer. Presumably, the resort had changed their policy, but when we asked about the other lift and why they had stopped running it, everyone looked at us strangely and no one remembered when it had run."
1,Straight fact,The controller came to me with the d-pad nonfunctional. shipping issue? doubtful. Wanted to return the product.. but having to pay the shipping all around for them to send me a new one would have ended up making it cost twice the amount of the controller. Over all it could've been a manufacturer mess up.. but whether or not you want to take that chance is entirely on you. Frankly I think this prob wont be the last time. The controller was very cheaply made. very light cheap plastic.. nothing like the original. My personal opinion: pay a little more and get an original.. they pop up from time to time on here. Its what I did.
4,On the Edge,"By SLLThis second book in the series is action packed. I liked it better than the first book because there is more emotion and excitement. Twig takes on new adventures without the help of his father. He demonstrates courage and bravery which is a theme throughout this book. As Screed leads Twig and his crew through the mire in the Twilight Woods, there are many dangers and surprises. Much to Twigs dismay, their guide is not who he seems to be and creates obsticles for Twig trying to reach ""The Edge"" in order to collect stormphrax-a substance taken from the heart of a storm. In their quest, Twig and his crew fight fearlessly to overcome these obsticles . Screeds collection of toes is disgusting and a mystery to all, and the Stone Pilot is carrying some secrets of his own. If you like action, gore, adventure, and mystery this is a great book for you."
5,Choking With Laughter,I must first confess I am not a cigar smoker and bought this book for a friend who is. He sat down with it and proceeded to chuckle and laugh and gaffaw. Then he began reading it aloud. It is funny. It's smart funny. It's a pretty quick read. It would fall under the catagory of bathroom reading. It's full of short pieces. You can jump in and out anywhere. It had a lot of energy. I really enjoyed it.
2,Not great but not awful,"I think this book must be able to hit someone well. I think if your just starting out, Christian and sort of interested in unschooling this might be a good book for you. Unfortunatly for me I have been homeschooling awhile and found this book a waste of my time. I don't like how they tell you to be wary of curriculum companies and people trying to sell you things but in the next sentence they are pushing ""their way"" on you. A little two faced for me. But I did walk away with some good information so it wasn't a total waste. I have read worse books on homeschooling that is for sure."
1,I ordered this but was sent a $3 candy bar,"I ordered this. The item description says it is 400grams (14.1 ounces) but what they sent me was a 100 gram bar. So, $14.50 for a $3.00 candy bar. How lovely.You do not get what you pay for. BEWARE!!!!"
5,Absolutely wonderful,Chocolate was very good and was shipped very quickly and arrived before the expected date. MikesMagicalDiscounts was very nice and personal about everything like I was actually ordering from a real person not a computer. :)
4,worded good,"This site was good for me. I'm trying to find mini golf supplies. I found it and it had all info I needed. Also, not bad prices. I looked the other things they carry,very good. I even found some things I wasn't looking for.I like the amazon place and I'm glad to find what I was looking for. Thank you all. Now my business can grow more and my dream to have a place for handicaps and all come to have fun. Thank you -Kim G."
1,Disappointment,"As others have stated it in the reviews.The biggest problem is the blades getting stuck.They just don't cut.Had these for about a year. Using it on my two cocker spaniels.Fur gets stuck, and the blades just stop moving.Just can't get it to ""comb"" through the coat.And yes it does get hot easily."
1,Wait for it.......,"If you want the Indiana Jones Trilogy, buy this or the already available box set. If you want to get the complete four films just wait, a four disk box set will probably be set for a Christmas release. No complaints here...just head shaking!"
3,Keeping up with the Jones'.....,"Everyone is complaining about the new discs that are coming out in May. I agree that multiple release are a pain in the [...].Has anyone thought they will release a new version at Christmas time? Yes folks, the movie comes out in May but the DVD will come out in November and guess what, it will probably come out in a four movie set and also come out in Blu-Ray. So that is three releases. May, regular DVD in November and Blu-Ray in November. On the bright side, once they come out in BD, it will be over....or will it???"
2,Bad buy,"I received the product quickly, but it is true that the material is reviewed one hundred percent, the discs were dirty, one of the disks did not work and the box was broken."
1,lets get something straight..,"For a DVD set that is marked for release 3 days from now, how come we have so many eager reviewers? I was very surprised. No doubt the IJ movies were amazing, but am I right in assuming the general public has NOT seen them on DVD? Amazon, whats going on here?"
2,"Great movies, great sound, unwatchable video...","Man, I regret buying the wide screen version of this set. The video is dull, flat and way too dark. That in combination with the wide aspect ratio on my 27"" monitor makes this instant garage sale material."
4,Great Collection!,"This is a great collection of the Indiana Jones movies. Included are all three movie which I think ""The Last Crusade"" was the best one. These movie feature better acting than Star Wars and don't rely on special effects to be great entertainment and have the best ac tors in the movie. The script is great and the sets look realistic. My only question, just like Star Wars is why isn't this a DVD boxed set? Anyways this is a great buy if you still want VHS!"
5,classic,"Great classic adventure movies. Had these on VHS and missed watching them, so i picked them up on dvd and haven't stopped watching them and reliving my childhood adventures! Harrison Ford is great and speilberg doesn't disappoint!"
4,the adventures of Indiana Jones,I was real pleased with the condition of the set of DVD movies The Adventures of Indiana Jones.They were in like new condition very please thanks.
3,Disappointment!,"I honor the talent of Steven Spielberg and George Lucas and I considerthe Inidiana Jones trilogy to be one of the best adventures I've ever seen. I do not understand why these two great men stopped producing new masterpieces about Indiana. They have NEVER CREATED ANYTHING BETTER since that ! They wasted more then a decade of their productive professional life on creating MEDIOCRE MOVIES! What's more, it looks like they decided to play money game with their audience by trying to earn as much as possible on VHS and leaving DVD release for rainy day in their careers. I am really disappointed! I think, it can push DVD release up if we stop buying VHS versions."
4,Great series,We bought this as a gift - advertised as new. The box the set came in was torn on the edges so I was concerned about the DVD's. Our grandson has watched two so far and the DVD's are fine. Hoping that the last and the bonus DVD are as well. A classic and fun to see a young one enjoy this series as much as we did.
3,But Why is There Still a Scene cut from Raiders?,"Good to have the series on DVD, but I was disappointed, appalled actually, that a scene in Raiders that was cut from the video was also cut on the dvd. In the cinema release of Raiders, immediately AFTER the credits, there was a cutaway to the boxed Ark of the Covenant in the US Govt warehouse, and the U.S. Govt brand on the box is gradually being burnt away by the Ark. The implication (as I read it) was that the Ark no more wanted to be held by the U.S. govt than held by the Nazis. But check your dvd's, folks, it ain't there no more. Which is a subtle but disturbing little piece of censorship."
4,great collection of Indian Jones films,Great collection of Indiana Jones movies. Widescreen edition! Amazon offered a fantastic price.
3,"Missing Scenes In ""Lost Ark""!","Five star movies (well, maybe not ""Temple..."") given a 2-star treatment on DVD. Right in the middle of ""Lost Ark"" several entire scenes have been cut. So we jump from Indy stuck in the ""Map Room"" straight to dropping by to see Marion in a tent. How did he get out? We never find out. Why isn't he surprised to find her alive after she was (apparently) blown up? Because the scene where he DID find out and WAS surprised was also cut. Why did they cut these scenes? Because they are hollywood idiots. Buyers beware -- this smacks of a planned future ""Special Edition"" where for another $25 we get to buy the ""real"" version that we thought we were getting in the first place."
2,Complete Indiana Jones set,This was false advertising. There are 4 movies & I only got 3 and the case was all torn up. I am not happy. They offered me 30% discount on another purchase but I will not buy from them again.
3,"Thanks George, but I'll wait.","These newest DVD editions sound great and they've got some great features on 'em. I have the box set that came out five years ago, (Wow! Has it been that long?)so I guess these new ones are just in time for moratorium (and to promote the new movie). Got to admit, if ya' don't have the first box set, these would be a great set to get AND you've got the option this time of getting just the ones you want (so if you ONLY like ""Raiders"" - there you are). Me, I'll wait for Blu-Ray. They'll probably put EVERYTHING on those - at least I hope so. If they don't, and I want to be a completist, I'll just wait 'til these are in the bargain bin somewhere and get 'em for cheap. This is just the cycle of DVD releases, ya' just gotta' make choices as a DVD consumer and movie FAN."
5,Great Movies for action!!,"We Love Indiana Jones, watched them over and over for ever. They were made when our children were young. Very entertaining!!We get a lot of our movies from Amazon, we have many,many DVDs.Have never got a bad one.Pat Christensen"
1,For the first time on DVD...NOT!,"Despite what the advertisements say, this is not the first time these movies are on DVD. It's a shameless double dip only being released to cash in on the new Indy movie. It's insulting that the studios think we're stupid enough to fall for it, although many people are apparently being suckered into buying it."
5,Great Movies,Love these movies. Its wonderful that they are now on DVDs. These movies are classics and I love watching them over and over
5,Indy Fans will love this set!,"Make the popcorn, grab a soda, get some chocolate covered raisins and treat yourself to an Indy marathon! Harrison Ford always delivers! Can't wait for Indy IV!!"
5,"Indiana Jones, need I say more","You have to love a scientist in his crusade for knowledge, adventure and history. I got it at a great price and the restoration of the movies is great, a little dark at times but great."
5,Will order the next Season,The product arrived safely and in relatively good shape. The content was what I had anticapated and the very reason it was ordered. I believe it can be assumed that I enjoy the DVD/CD(s). You probably have figured out that I strongly dislike being made to write these reviews. I can see reviewing a book or a product that is being tried for the first time.
2,Thorny with few roses,"I really didn't care for this CD, and, in fact, removed most of it from my mp3 player. But I do often find myself listening to the ""Revolutionary Girl Utena"" closing soundtrack, and sometimes the ""Crayon Kingdom"" song.So I didn't like the thorny CD, and neither did many of the other reviewers. But it had a couple of roses on it.Your mileage may vary. It is up to you if you want to buy it for just a few songs."
1,Not at all what I had hoped for,"This CD is the biggest disappointment I have bought in years. I purchased it hoping to have some cool techno-dance remixes of some of my favorite anime themes.Unfortunately, what happens here is a disorganized mess.First, about the vocals. Kikuko Inoue sings some of the songs very well, and butchers some of the others. Some of these songs are meant to be sung by someone younger, and it really shows.To be honest, the techno music on the CD is repetitive (even for techno), uninspired and boring. If that weren't bad enough, the music generally doesn't fit the song that's being sung.That's right, it sounds like they created a whole bunch of straight techno songs and then arbitrarily decided it would be a good idea to tack on the vocal parts of some well-known anime theme songs.If you love the actual anime theme songs, please don't waste your money on this [stuff]. It will just encourage them to make more."
1,Read this book with caution,"Her analysis of current children's ministry is that it is broken. But she her solution is to ""imagine"" a new way and a new future (see italics in the introduction). The solution is not to use our imaginations but to use the scriptures. Our imaginings is what has gotten us into this mess. Enough. Back to the Bible plain and simple."
2,Not what I thought,"I ordered these labels using my cell phone and did not notice they are for Laser Printers instead of ink jet like the 8660. Not sure how they work on Laser printers, but they do not work on ink jet. Thought I was getting a good deal on a larger package, but did not notice that when I searched for 8660 it also brought up these 5660 and the package looks almost the same. Should have paid more attention to the label."
5,very nice show,I love it. It came when it said it would and I like it. Me and my friend started watching it right away. I had never heard of it but it sounded interesting. Very good show
4,Steppenwolf - just no softies ?!,"The fact that I was born 35 years too late for Rock 'n' Roll makes it kinda special for me to have seen Steppenwolf on stage. They were rockin' in Wichita Falls, TX in September 2000. They just rule playing all the songs they're known for, ""Born to be Wild"", ""Magic Carpet Ride""... You find all that good stuff on disc 1 of ""Silver"", but disc 2 really disappointed me. Steppenwolf are just no softies, most of their ballads are no good."
2,poor release,Not enought matches here:Matches:Palestina (the Terrorist) vs. Tina Ferrari 2nd season (Tina wins in a no disqualification match).Hollywood (the Street Punk) vs. Sally The Farmer's Daughter 3rd season.the Housewives (Arlene & Phyllis) vs. Amy (The Farmer's Daughter) & The California Doll. 2nd seasonNinotchka vs. Americana 2nd season.Ninotchka vs. Americana rematch 2nd season.Ninotchka vs. Tina Ferrari 2nd season.Bonus Matches.Hollywood & Vine vs. Mountain Fiji from 1st season.Heavy Metal Sisters (Spike & Chainsaw) vs. The CheerleadersSusie Spirit & Debbie Debutantenot enough matches if you ask me
3,Sporadic,"These speakers give a good bang for the buck. Very balanced sound, and nice power. However, the connection on the right speaker is a bit loose, and the right speaker goes out sporadically. It takes a little jiggling to fix the problem, but can be very annoying."
3,"Fair, but many of the facts tired and worn out.....","To hear the same facts over and over again is boring, to say the least. It may be factual but not interesting at least for myself.The little known facts are not so little known. Some even questionable. Others are.....interesting. Worth the money but other reference material is better for the buck."
1,This Is The Worst Toy I Ever Had!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"When i got this toy for xmas i thought wow now i can make cotton candy! but after i used it once it stopped working correctly. i put it away and forgot about it until yesterday(6\10\03). i got it out and it worked, but then, big suprise(not!!!)it it did the same thing it did the last time i used it! i tried to call the toll free # but it had been disconnected. then i tried to get their website but it ""was under construction"".so now im stuck w this piece of garbage. i advise those of u who haven't wasted their good $ yet to just save up and buy the real thing."
1,JUNK,"What more can I say JUNK, JUNK, JUNK. Don't waste your money!! You hardly get any cotton candy, it is really messy hard to clean. They should not even be able to sell it. We could not even get rid of it in a garge sale gave it to the good will."
1,Doesn't even deserve 1 star.,"This product DOES NOT WORK! My 5 year old wanted to use her own money to buy something. She chose this product. We took it home; it took 45 minutes to set up and troubleshoot because it doesn't work easliy. The biggest of many problems is the lid doesn't stay put which means the connections don't line up, which means, it keeps turning off. The second problem is most of the (minimal amount of) cotton candy comes out hard & stiff. Third, it started to smoke; fourth, it is almost impossible to clean!! The instructions inside the box say Not to return it to the store you bought it from, and tells you to call a toll free number for help. No one answered, left a message, still haven't heard from them. They're probably laughing their way to the bank!"
2,smell the burning sugar,This toy was fun for the kids but as an adult I was concerned about the flame that would occur every so often. I also found the directions vague.
3,Better than the hand-held but still needs work,"My sis, (surprise-she has no kids of her own), bought this for my then 3 1/2 yr old. I must admit that it works better than the hand-held version that sis also bought, but it still shuts down easily. You have to keep your finger on button for awhile & not release, which is hard for young to understand. If you release too soon, you have to wait for it to reset. It would be faster & easier to find a circus somewhere in the U. S. & go there than to mess w this toy. Of course it only takes its own refills which are quickly deplenished. I would not buy it ( & could kill sis for buying it). Ours sits on the shelf, waiting to go to Goodwill."
1,Disappointment,"I could not be more disappointed with this product. First of all, the product came in a box two or three times too large, and the box was open by the time it was received. Secondly, the machine does not come with any cotton candy mix. I had happened to get some while shopping, otherwise, we would have had none. At least it should contain one packet. Finally, after spending over an hour trying to get it to work, we had to give up. As my daughter's main Christmas present, she was understandably upset the rest of the day. I would never recommend anyone purchase this horrible product."
1,Really bad,"Really bad, and always was. I know this band feels like they got a bad rap, but they didn't go anywhere because they really weren't that good. Sure, they probably got [misrepresented] by the record companies, but they were busy selling music people actually wanted to hear. I know one of the members is still trying to see if they somehow got missed, by releasing all this [stuff], but it's over. Don't quit your day job."
4,Interesting overview and reinvention of Belew's songs,"Polymath. The word certainly describes Adrian Belew. His credits include a stint with Zappa, Bowie, Talking Heads, King Crimson and The Bears. Where he wasn't a sideman (Crimson & The Bears) he brought his unique songwriting style to (pardon the pun)bear.This acoustic reinvention of previously released songs and new tunes is one of Belew's finest recordings. His covers of If I Fell (the Beatles tune), Roy Orbison's Crying and his own work with Crimson (Matte Kudasi)and Bears tunes gives you an idea of the man's talent and depth.He's taken a lot of heat from hardcore Crimson fans (I happen to be one having purchased their first album in 1969 at the ripe old age of 9) for bringing humor and his hook filled songwriting style to the band. Fripp recognized that Belew would help revitalize and reinvent Crimson. Here Belew reinvents himself. Classic."
3,Maybe I was to harsh,"The company replaced the flashlight and this one worked, but still no batteries. I live in a rural area ( no street lights) so I needed this flashlight for when I walk my dogs. I have to say thank you."
1,Not new condition.,We bought the book for our military Son for Christmas. When it got to our home it was in not very good used condition. We bought new. There was no time to send it back as it was a gift.
3,Great subject and great price but...,"International relations is fascinating but this text is so dry it's hard to really get in to it. Seems more about skimming the surface so you can try to memorize tons of facts, instead of going in depth with anything to make it more meaningful."
1,This book is JUST LIKE THE 2006-2007 EDITION,"Don't buy the new edition. It contains nothing new except just added more current events. If you want to save up, purchase the 2006-2007 edition because the content is just about the same in regards to the concept of trade, foreign policy systems and how the world court works too."
4,A funkin' good time,"While not as good as their first album Nosotros, nothing beats poppin' a Rubberneck CD into your car, rollin' down the window and goin' for a drive. Everytime these guys start making music together, it puts a smile on your face and makes you just happy to be alive."
1,NOT Kensington K60006US model ! Dimensions WRONG !,"Current Kensington MODEL IS NOT WHAT IS SHOWN.Kensington says this is model K60006US :[...]DIMENSIONS CAN NOT BE ""3 x 80 x 15.8 inches"" !!!"
1,Disappointing,This book was billed as an insight into the very rich life style. I pulled almost zero insight from this book. Found it rather boring -- perhaps it was written for the 13-year-old range. I was embarrassed I read the whole book.
2,Not cheesy,"I don't know if I received a bad batch, or what, but these taste like saltines. Not even close to cheez its."
5,Great Product,Back to Nature Crispy Cheddar Crackers are a good food for health conscious individuals and are quite tasty to boot. The 1 oz bags are just the right size to take in a lunch. Kids would like these crackers too. They have a nice gentle cheese taste.
3,I Remembered The Future!!!!,"This is another CD that I originally owned on vinyl when it first came out....Nektar never really became much of a household word...even back in the days of album rock radio stations. Their playing and vocals are fair-good. The title selection probably makes it worth buying this CD. I remembered the future and went out and bought it! if you like 70's art rock like Yes, Gentle Giant, and Triumverat...you may like this."
5,Glad I discovered the re-issue,After hearing the LP in 1974 (a friend and I swiped his older sister's copy for a listen...) I knew these guys were special. Being only 12 yrs at the time - it took me 2 weeks to save enough $ to get my own copy! Back in the day when kids actually mowed lawns to get money...now I'm rambling. Anyhow I don't need to go into detail about my disappointment having bought a pre 2002 CD - it sucked!!! I browsed Amazon last week and noticed the re-issue (yeah!) Bought it and loving it... I've been listening to an mp3 version ripped from vinyl. I had to make do. It's now cost me over $60.00 to get the proper recording (2 Cd's) - That's a lot of lawns. Bellaphon should remove the improper recording that is still available for sale at Amazon and other retailers... That would be the proper thing to do!
2,Disappointing,"I was disappointed with this game. All the reviews made it sound great, but its not. The controls are ok, but the weapon use is inconsistent and difficult to use. The game play is ok, but nothing special. Maybe it's more fun if you race against someone, but I found the one player mode to be not much fun."
2,too many hangups,"this game is a monster sized pain in the butt.you cruise around far slower than everyone else.the weopons are never there when you need them.you get totaly screwed when you get hit by one however and of course the computer gets like barely fazed at all.then theres the whole booger,herpes,poop aspect.once again,nothing funny about that guys.can we grow up already?"
4,A Thought-Provoking and entertaining book,"Gordon Dickson's Earth Lords, as with most great Science Fiction, actually a book about now. His depiction of an alienated and discriminated against group plotting revenge against the world that made them outcasts should strike a chord with everyone who reads it. In addition, the characterisation, plot and prose are excellent, this is an 'easy' read, the pages turn quickly and the story envelopes you with ease. What it isn't is easy thinking. A book well worth seeking out."
3,"overall pretty cool if you like heartbreak station, I do.","I AGREE WITH THE PREVIOUS REVIEWER THE PRODUCTION IS PRETTY WEAK, BUT THEY INTENDED IT TO BE THAT WAY. THE WERE TRYING TO CATCH THAT NEW ORLEANS VOODOO BLUES VIBE WHICH THEY WELL ACCOMPLISHED. DO YOU REMEMBER WHAT ITS LIKE TO LISTEN TO AN OLD BLUES RECORD? REMEMBER HOW THEY SOUND ALL SCRATCHY AND LOW AT TIMES? WELL, THATS WHAT A FEW SONGS FROM THE ALBUM SOUND LIKE. IF THIS WASNT SO ID GIVE THEM A THREE AND HALF WHICH I CAN'T REGARDLESS. I ENJOY THIS CD ON OCCASSION 'CAUSE IT HAS LIFE AND SOUL IN IT AND HELPS YOU RELAX. THIS CD TAKES ME TO BACK TO MY DADDYS FARM 'CAUSE THE BIG CITY LIFE HAS LOSTS ALL ITS CHARM. REMEMBER CINDERELLA'S HEARTBREAK STATION? WELL THESE ROCKERS ARE GOING IN THAT DIRECTION, WHICH IS RELLY COOL BECAUSE I MISS BANDS LIKE SALTY DOG, BRITNY FOX, AND CINDERELLA."
3,Glad to be Alive to Talk about It,"I bought this for the version of Eartha Kitt's "" I Love Men "" as I hadn't heard it in Forever(and really wanted to) Now...I just put it in the cd player and forget that maybe not everyone is raising their kid's to know all the words to "" I'm too Sexy ""... I have a hard time thinking that only people who are re-living the past would want this disc,it works pretty well here and now in the 21st century ( although the Divine stuff is not my favorite )there is a whole series of Glad to be Gay,this is only the very beginning....1993"
5,great phone att e597-1,"at and t e 597-1 is a great phone i have 4 of them with an answering machine, thank you"
4,"So much promise, but was with the ending?","This book succeeds on a lot of levels. It is rich in Hollywood lore and names (yes, you need a knowledge of Hollywood history at some parts--but that is nice to see--an author who rewards her readers and doesn't dumb down her book). The book is loaded with red herrings and odd characters. I liked all of it and knocked out in two days. The story was original and very film noir. Still, the ending puzzled the heck out of me. Happy? Sad? What in the world? A sequel? Got me. I think I sort of figured something out, but frankly even with the ""leave ya hanging"" end, the book is much better than the average genre junk out there. Finally, I did read on interview with Knode where she promises a sequel. She also discusses how much of a feminist book this was. I missed that, but still liked the book a great deal."
3,"Your right, the ending was weak.....","It was an excellent mind candy book. It did not take to much to get through and held enough of my interest. The first piece started out strong but then it turned into a syrup sweet novel the last 100 pages.What was that last chapter about? Probably, the hope for a sequel."
3,Poorly drawn main character...,"...limits quality of new mystery/thriller. Some good moments here, and I wouldn't mind seeing more of the secondary cop character, Doug Lockwood. The author falls into the all too common trap of making her heroine so tough as to be less than believable, and so violent as to be a caricature."
3,Mr. Freeze must be frozen 'cause his arms dont move,"All should be aware: although this is the same mold as the Lex Luthor figure, neither the arms (elbows, wrists) nor the legs (only the knees bend) are articulated. The head will rotate, but you have to turn the torso. Despite these limitations, its still a good figure.The cannon & pack are too unwieldly in battle, but they look cool. Outrageously priced, but best seen yet."
4,Lightweight!,"I purchased two chairs, one for me and one for my husband. For me the chair is perfect. I weight about 110 but my husband who is about 270 it is not so good!! (Chair is way to small for him) I love it for myself because when I take my children to the beach it is very easy for me to carry along with all the other beach accessories!! I would recommend it for someone looking for a light weight chair that is easy to bring along places."
5,Beautiful and breath-taking!!!!,"This DVD is excellent! My husband and I watched it. I love David Attenborough.I'm a birder and this is magnificent! My husband just became one in 2006.He loved is so much that he agreed when I immediately purchased it.I dream of some day seeing these beautiful birds! They are magnificent and beautiful. The photography, narrator, and the way they put the DVD together is great!"
2,NO,"I was not happy with this at all, despite being a huge David Attenborough fan. From the beginning, way too much of the crew including extreme cleavage shots kids dont need to see. Greatly prefer the tried and true format of other Attenborough dvds with his occasional appearance and main focus on the wildlife."
2,Fun for..... AWHILE,"This game is pretty funny the first couple of times you start to play it. But it's really lame as a one player game, 3 or 4 players is the best you can get out of this game. I would not recommend buying this game because after awhile you'll know all the questions."
2,Cute but not a good game,"Coming from a huge fan of South Park... I was dissapointed after the first time that I played through the game by myself. The questions repeated themselves after three games. Playing in the four player mode is more enjoyable but still leaves much to be desired. Just as a side note... If they can have a game as detailed as ""The Legend of Zelda Ocerina of Time"" could they have not added at least 50 more questions to this game? Final rating... Cute as related to South Park but Totally lame as a Video Game."
2,Hamilton Beach Can Opener,"While this can opener is a lot quieter than my last one, it does have a major flaw. It drops the can after opening it. I have wiped up a few spills because of this. I have used it approx 30 times and it held the can 4 of those. Due to this, I am already looking for a new can opener."
5,Easy to Wed,"Excellent, wardrobe, plot, clean and funny. Love it can't wait for it to be released on DVD."
3,Looks like it was a library book.,Its a great book. Ive ordered pre owned books before and they have always been is pristine shape. This book had its pre owned flaws but still worth keeping. Looks like it was a library book.
4,Good for a Laugh,"Personally, I think this movie is pretty cheesy, and it isn't one of my favorites. My husband, however, thinks it is a riot. He loves it. He laughs out loud every time he watches it. For me, it is worth watching it just to see my husband's reaction.We both like the characters and how it plays off of Star Trek. I think the acting is good."
4,SciFi Laughs at Itself,"I expected a few laughs from Galaxy Quest, but was pleasantly entertained beyond what I thought this film would do for me. There's many humorous references to Star Trek, but beyond that I enjoyed the clever integration of dry wit, 70s-style SciFi camp, and moments of wackyness. For instance, the Thermian's mannerisms seem clearly inspired by Andy Kaufman, with a little Al Gore stiffness thrown in. A wonderfully silly movie that I don't hesitate to recommend."
1,"love the movie, but I thought I was purchasing the movie, but I was shocked to find I was renting same,","I am very disappointed that this was presented as a purchase, but in fact it was a rental, thanks for making this one disgusting piece of deception!"
5,You Will Be Avenged!,"What a treat to see this movie hit Blue-Ray. An underapreciated brilliant masterpeice of a comedy. The movie has a collection of awesome characters played to perfection by a brilliant cast, and Weaver looks amazing in this film. Her best ever in my opinion, and she's no spring chicken. Good for her. A true Alien-Movie legend, in an great roll, looking super. Galaxy Quest is a truly fun movie that will make you laugh, make you care, and entertain you from start to finish. That's the point afterall, isn't it. ""COOL""!"
4,Lots of Fun,This is a fun film especially if you have any knowledge of the whole Trekkie movement and the show itself. Quite clever.
3,Wide screen - again?,"The DVD isn't out yet, but I am already disappointed. The movie was great for what it was, but I am so very tired of DVDs being released in widescreen-only format. How many people have widescreen TVs? This format on my 32"" is about the same as going back to my old 19"". I wish the DVD releases were designed for those buying them, instead of those selling them."
1,Putting Tim Allen In A Movie Is A Lot Like Multiplying Zeros,"A good plot, a plausible storyline, and a good solid cast of characters are just a few of the many things that make a good movie. This movie had none of those. There is only one thing I hate more than this movie--that guy who scoops ice cream at Thrifty who told me I had to wait my turn to be served. Tim Allen is about as entertaining as a bucket of chum, so unless you are a whale I would not watch this lame movie. I did not have toast this morning."
3,Title,"The film has some nice moments, mostly courtesy of Alan Rickman. Perhaps the nicest touch is that they used the voice of Joe Frank, of LA underground radio fame, as the voice of the computer. This is an amiable, periodically amusing feel-good film that will appeal to people who really like films like Howard Stern's ""Private Parts"" -- films that are more palliative than outright hilarious."
4,"Fun Movie, a perpetual classic.","This is one of those fun movies that will be popular enough to re-run on cable forever, like ""Jaws"" and ""The Shawshank Redemption"". You don't have to be a ""Star Trek"" fan to catch the in-jokes. Watch Sigourney Weaver's lips when she says ""Well SCREW THIS!"" Don't know if that was intentional or not, but it is funny.Plus, hats off the the DVD makers for including one of the most original bonus features ever!"
4,I knew those little green guys were killers right away!,"This movie was fantastic! Wouldn't it really be a great TV series?I do have a question that keeps gnawing at me; at the end of the movie when all of the GQ crew are exiting the ship, I noticed that the alien girl (don't recall name) stumbled and looked to me like she broke her ankle just before the camera cut away. Did anyone else notice this? It's just one of those little things that drives you nuts until you find out!If you saw it and/or know what happened please e-mail me at tmaguire@z.com!"
4,Witty and sly,"I went to this movie expecting a few things: some good Trek one-liners, some neat special effects, and a cheezy Tim Allen plot. What I got was even funnier than I expected, as well as a story that rivaled the last actual Trek movie (the abominible Insurrection)! This movie was excellent--funny, smart, and not insulting (well, not too insulting) to the Trekkies it pokes fun at. Well worth a watch!The DVD has excellent picture and sound quality. The extras are a mixed bag. The deleted scenes are pretty good, but the Thermian Language track is annoying--who in their right mind would sit and watch more than a minute or two in a screchy, made up alien tongue?"
4,Excellent DVD package - SPOLER ALERT,"There are two aspects of the DVD package which bear special mention. First is the Omega 13 option on the Special Features menu. The second is an alternate ssoundtrack which iss magnificent in its lunacy. I don't want to spoil it completely, but suffice it to say that you will not believe your ears.As for the film itself, it's better than any Star Trek movie since The Voyage Home. My parents, who never saw a Star Trek episoide in their lives, and my son who has seen every one, enjoyed it equally. It is wry, affectionate, funny and exciting, and good clean family fun."
4,Just what i was looking for.,"I was looking for some ""oldies but goodies"" and this compilation has them all."
1,Do not be fooled.,"For those of you (like me) who thinks that this is the NBC show ""The Pretender"" staring Michael T. Wiss, this isn't. Do not order this if you want that DVD set. There's no review above to let you know what this is. Again, this isn't the outstanding NBC show. Perhaps it will come out soon, but this isnt' it."
4,A hard game but a great challenge,"The biggest problem I have with games these days is that you can finish them so quickly. South Park Rally was a refreshing difference. It really is quite hard toplay to start with, that is until you get use to the fact that you are not driving in circles and that you infact have to think to play.The game has over 30 characters but as yet I havn't unlocked nearlly half that."
1,It just doesn't do Q justice.,"Although there were a few funny lines here and there, this book was not worth the money I paid for it and I ended up returning it. It should have been called ""Sinical Superlatives"" by someone desperatley trying to capture Q's sense of humor. I was quite dissapointed and would not recommend this book."
4,Virtual Bible / Well worth the money / MP3 Player Causion,"This is my 3rd audio Bible. My first was dramatized, second with Alexander Scorby. This by all means my favorite. It is like I step into a Virtual Bible. I put my headphones on and all the imagination my brain can harness paints a picture before my eyes. My big beef and main reason for not giving it 5 stars is because of a technical issue. I had the purpose of listening to this on my Creative Labs 40GB Nomad MP3 Player. The struggle was that when I imported them into my ""Real"" player all the names for each chapter file were the same. So I had to rename each file and give each file a CD track # so my MP3 Player could play each track in each book in the proper order. Otherwise very well done."
3,Wrong toy train included,"The DVD selection of stories was fine and my grandson enjoyed the stories, which I would have rated 5 stars. However, the picture shows what looks to be Bertie the red bus as the ""toy"" included, which is one that my grandson had been asking for. Instead the package contained another blue Thomas the tank engine, of which we already have several. Perhaps Amazon should scan the current package to show the correct toy. Others that I have ordered from Amazon have contained toy trains that match the picture."
1,This book stinks!,This book has no examples of anything. The sample tests have poor explainations. It offers nothing the PMBOK doesn't already offer. Its that simple
4,LaCrosse Atomic Clock from Amazon.com,"I had to replace a very old LaCrosse Atomic Clock that we loved! This one is just as much fun, has a few additional features and is great to own. It gives us the indoor and outdoor temperatures as well as the time, date, day and moon phases. We really use it many times a day so it is in a perfect place - the eating area of the kitchen. We depend on the temperatures to know how we need to dress before going out. It's a handsome clock and comes in other wood finishes as well as a metal cabinet. I highly recomend it."
3,clock,OK but we never did get the clock to set atomic to work like it was suppose to.. Other than that I like it....
1,A piece of garbage!,"The outdoor sensor failed after 2 weeks. Company sent a new one that was faulty. I dont have the time to wait on hold anymore for them replace it, so we are living with an expensive clock and no outdoor temp reading. Not worth the money."
3,Nice introduction to subject but little detail,"A concise history of the Arab Israeli Conflict 4th Ed. This bookis 379 pages published by Pearson Education. This details info about Islam and Judaisim and moves very fast into the 20th century where the crux of the conflict occured. It explains in detail but at the same time in general themes if that is possible. It is not as detailed as some books I have seen but it will do the reader very nicely who wants to go deeper than the surface about the inticacies of this conflict. The author does incorporate a stunning photo on the cover with the view of the Wailing Wall and Dome of the Rock. While documents are provided at the end of the chapters, there are some that I feel are essential to look at but are left out. While its a good book I am goign to rate this one average because I know of a much better book (Palestine and the Arab-Israeli Conflict by C.D. Smith)."
4,A Good Movie!.,I first saw The Sugarland Express when I was eight years old and I liked this movie and I enjoyed the chase scenes and the acting from the entire cast was good especially Goldie Hawn and I highly recommend this movie!
5,His voice is still excellent.,"Timeless songs. Saw him in Las Vegas at the MGM Fall 1998, that was an excellent performance as is this CD."
4,A high energy Tom Jones Las Vegas live show from 1971.,Tom throws his usual energy and The Voice into a show featuring both greatest hits and other songs. Tom Jones fans are bound to listen to it again and again.
5,Roseanne Rocks!,"I think it was ingenious how they integrated the ""New"" Becky in. Rosanne has humor that is so unexpected. Even though your used to one actor playing a part, they didn't miss a beat. It has all the great episodes you've come to love. Buy it!"
1,AWFUL,BOOOO! These were awful! I can't believe I wasted my money on this! Roseanne? Why did I do it? WHYYYY!?
2,Deja vu,"When my copy ofScientific Design of Exhaust & Intake Systems by John C. Morrison(Contributor), Philip Hubert Smith arrived I was quite excited. A scholarly text on intakes and exhaust! When I went to put it with others like it on my book shelf I realized that it was written by the same author that wrote The Design and Tuning of Competition Engines, Philip Smith. Both books are opaque, and aren't very logical when it comes to the flow of the explanations. There are lots of equations without explanation. It could use a rewrite."
5,ON POINT!,This is definately one of my favorite CD's...it's on heavy rotation while cooking dinner..or sitting in front of the fire-place..I absolutely Love This CD!
1,Tries hard to be a good book...but flops.,"This is one of the stupidest romance/suspense novels I've read in a long time. It was the first Barbara Delinsky book I've ever read, and now I know that I won't read any more. I kept hoping that the characters would stop being so annoying, but they didn't. The ""suspense"" element is incredibly easy to guess (maybe Delinsky didn't want to make it a surprise?) and the hero and heroine behave in very unrealistic ways. And the love scenes are terrible; they actually made me laugh. It sounds like Barbara was working from a book entitled, ""How to Write Poetic Romance Scenes and Make Them Sound Profound."" Overly sappy and definitely not a keeper. Don't waste your money."
3,Challenging Patterns,"These patterns are not for the novice knitter nor are they particularly suitable for a knitter's first felting project. I have not made any of these purses but with forty years of knitting experience and after having read through several of the patterns, these purses require a fair amount of detail work and finishing. Also, it may be a problem finding the hardware (purse clips, grommets, etc.) in order to finish the purse. There are some interesting shapes and designs for those knitters who want a bit of a challenge."
1,Incredible baloney,"One must be either totally paranoid or incredibly gullible to believe the point of this book. The authors argue in every chapter that the entire western world has plotted for hundreds of years up to and including the present time to rid the world of the Jewish people. These ""plots"" even involve modern US administrations and modern American intelligence services. The authors ""prove"" their point by referring endlessly to other books which say no such thing (but which do flesh out their bibliography to impress anyone who might not bother to check), and by referring to ""confidential interviews with old spies"" who are not identified and must be taken on faith.Sorry, fellahs, but that requires more faith than I can muster."
4,The shock of the truth.,"Are we just pawns to be used at will,for the sake of the greedy !... Are all wars for greed and power and there socondry cause for peace. The discusting truth/future frightens the hell out of me. A bloody hard book to put down."
5,It's a decent entry level helmet for the money.,I bought this for some occasional flux core welding. If you're doing some heavy work I would think a better helmet would be recommended but for the $13.99 I paid it works for me. The clear inner shield is about as thin as the packing on some meat wrappers and pops out if you press on it lightly. You can easily replace it with a piece of safety glass off that big 4 letter auction site and I will be doing so. Head fit and adjustment are OK and at the price I got what I expected and I'm not disappointed but my rating is based on that so if you're doing some heavy welding don't buy this one. If I wasn't so cheap I'd have gone for the auto darkening mask.
3,classic PS game...,"This is one that I wanted for my collection. I love , love South Park and if you do then this is a must have!"
2,Could Be Better,"Good idea, but somewhat disappointing...There aren't enough questions per round, if you get a question wrong, chef does not tell you the correct answer, if you play twice in a row, you get repeat questions. But the mini games are lots of fun - some (if not all) are take-offs of other classic video games; although some are pretty difficult."
1,Pointless waste of money,"The back cover of this book claims ""Master the awesome web power of DHTML, style sheets and JavaScript 1.2/1.3!"" The only thing you'll master is a JavaScript Debugger. Any professional web designer churning out this quality of worked would be fired. Even a casual user would be disappointed by the amateurish focus on a single (minority) browser. All of the `code' is designed to run in Netscape only, what use is that? The issue of cross browser coding isn't even mentioned. The quality of the examples that do work is dreadful, most of them look like they've been designed in half an hour and make use of embarrassingly dated graphics. Save your money and time."
5,stompin'!!,This CD keeps you dancing and laughing right through. It's a must have for any one who loves Country Music.
5,Amazing representation of Jesus,"This 4 volume set is a word for word quotation of the Scripture in the NIV translation. Filmed on location in the Middle East and Africa, events of the Bible are expertly enacted by a believable group of actors. Bruce Marchiano's portrayal of Jesus is life changing. His performance is marked with love and joy. The God of love would certainly have enjoyed healing and building relationships with the people He had created. I was especially touched by Jesus' tenderness. I could not give any movie a higher recommendation."
1,Useless........... Waste of money........Try your luck....,I purchased this from amazon. First bitter experience through amazon purchase. I bought this for my new house. Opened the package only after moving there - after 2 months from purchase. Used new duracell batteries. No display. Not even able to use with the manual setting.Contacted customer service. Asked me to pay the shipping (which costs $10.40) and return the item. After going through similar reviews I thought it will be waste of money because nobody received a working clock back.Bought a Sharp atomic clock from ebay for $20. Receives signal very fast and working flawlessly.
5,Love these clocks,"This was bought as a replacement for the same type of clock, but with moon phases. We had the other for about 5 years, before being knocked off the half wall onto the tile floor. The digital screen cracked, and the time was difficult to read. This led to the purchase of this newer clock. I like the barometric pressure option over the moon phases. But the best part of this clock is the large easy to read time, that is always correct. We have way too many power outages. We have not had issues with the sensor. Ours is keeped between the screen and the glass pane of the closest (double paned) window."
2,Worked well for ONE YEAR.,"This product was awesome but only worked for a year. After the warranty period passed, I might as well have started hitting it with a hammer. First, the LCD display gets foggy. Then the outdoor temperature monitor just dies--completely. I tried to take it apart and see what's up but no water damage, no extreme temps, nothing... Just died. Finally, the LCD freezes on the time 6:31pm (think Final Destination) and that's the end. Clock is done.A solid $35 for one year. Then you'll buy another one. I've read several similar stories. Maybe try another brand?"
2,Read fine print before buying!,La-Crosse states on website that (all atomic clocks) it can take 3-5 NIGHTS (72-120 hours) before clock will automatically re-set for DST. So I can either manually re-set the clocks or wait and remember that the time may or may not be correct for about a week. Not worth it. Anyone know of a better atomic clock?
1,not that accurate,"When I called the factory to tell them that the clock was 2 degrees warmer than the remote in the same 3 foot space, they told me that they were only accurate to within 2 degrees each. that could add up to anything less than 4. I love the look, and if the temperature were accurate, it would be perfect."
4,Looks good and works great,I have for about 7 months now and it is working pretty great. Didn't have to change the battery for the clock on the receiver for the weather/temperature check. No issues with readability or angle of view (Don't hang it very high on the wall (hanging 8ft from the ground).It measures 8x12 and might look a bit smaller on large walls. I would have preferred it to be a bit bigger.
4,La Crosse Atomic Clock / Indoor - Outdoor Temperature,"The subject clock and temperature / weather forecaster is a lovely piece of furniture and seems to be exactly accurate with indoor temps. I think the outside temps are right on, as well. I'm not too sure about the ""weather forecaster,"" as yet, since I have not read up on when the little ""sun"" or ""clouds"" appear, whether it is current or in advance of a weather change. We also like the large numbers for the time which is easy to read from a distance. I would purchase it again. We like it and the price was reasonable, too."
2,Outside Temperature Sensor Doesn't Work,"When I first started using the clock, the outside temperature sensor worked okay, but it has since gotten to the point where it is unreliable. Sometimes it displays the temperature, but most of the time it doesn't. It just shows dashes on the display. I've changed batteries several times, trying to get it to work, and I've performed the procedure exactly as described in the manual. This is disappointing because all the other functions work fine. I've also tried various placements of the sensor to no avail. If I place the sensor next to the clock, it seems to work OK, so I think it is a design issue that needs to be fixed. The transmitter in the sensor is simply not powerful enough to send the temperature reading more than a few feet. I also use a Meade unit that has worked fine since day one. I've even turned off the Meade unit, thinking perhaps it was an interference problem, but that wasn't the case. This is too bad, because I otherwise like the unit."
3,weather is meh,Love the big bold time adn the temps work great but the weather condition signal is a bit lame. It shows rain... not when it is raining but when the weather is going to get worse. It would be better if it had different pictures or if it had humidity rather than something that is really rather nonspecific
1,These are horrible!!!!,"I purchased a spool of these last month and have had nothing but problems. The top 3 on the spool wouldn't even register as ""blank media"" in my burner. I tried to return them, but was told (retailer issue) that they don't return opened blank media (floppies, vhs, cassette, cdrs,) etc. I emailed the company and decided to try one out of the middle of the spool. Success! It worked. However, 20 discs later, I have had about 7 that have turned out badly; basically static that makes the music unlistenable. I tried it on different players with the same result (and I'm burning @ 2x). I tried a different brand (smart and friendly) and had no problems. In regards to the customer service, I was just told (also) to try one from the middle of the spool and/or try different cd burner software. I kept up this communication with them for over a week, and they never once offered to either replace them or refund my money. I WILL NEVER BUY THESE AGAIN!"
3,Disapointing,"A few Basic patterns, redone over and over. Too much space wasted on redundant stitch tutorial, and not enough pattern vareity."
3,Somethings not right here...,"The comment, when this book was read by my deer hunting Husband, was that the author must not be from Oregon. The range for the Mule deer was for the whole state of Oregon, and its really only from the East Side of the Cascade range and East. The Blacktail deer, which is not mentioned in the book at all, range from the West side of the Cascades to the West. The range of the Whitetail Deer is not the length of the Cascades, as in the book, but in small portions of Southern, Northeastern and the Roseburg Area. If all this is wrong, what else is inaccurate?"
4,"Great sensation, fullness, and comfort","I love these. However, wish they were a bit larger.I love wearing them around both my testicles and penis. The sensation is incredible. The climax is much, much stronger. Helps you last a lot longer, get much, much harder and shoot with much more strenghth. The contractions when you ejaculate and after you ejaculate feel great. It's easy to get off. Gave it four stars because wearing it around base of penis and balls at the same time makes it break faster.Super Stretchy Erection Maker Blue Cock Ring 3 Pack"
3,Pretty good,"It works fine. I wish the motor was stronger but I guess it works out because when the dog moves and the grinder hits my nail, it doesnt do much damage. Only problem is that it still takes a considerable amount of time to do. I have to take breaks to let the dog rest."
3,Not Enough Information,"The nail grinder seems to be everything advertised, but like so many other buyers, it would sure be nice if Oster provided more information. Virtually nothing is provided, so thank goodness there are others who have used the Internet to describe their experiences with the grinder, and their recommendations."
5,Nails Galore,"I bought this product after reading the reviews on the cheaper electric nail trimmers. This trimmer has what it takes to get the job done with my two large dogs who have very hard nails. I was surprised how quickly they adjusted to having their nails done with this. My Doberman has taken 6 years for her to let me trim her nails in one sitting with regular nail clippers. She took to the Oster grinder in one session. I was amazed. I trim the hair around the feet first on my Australian Shepherd then I grind (I wouldn't want hair to get tangled in it. Still have to watch carefully to make sure the grinder does not get the quik. It works fast, so need to be careful. I bought extra grinder disks but I haven't had to use them yet."
4,overall good,"TheOster Nail Grinderworks well overall. I like the variable speed and its power. It's far superior to the battery run one heavily advertised which doesn't have the power for medium and larger breeds or any dog (animal) with thick, hard nails. Beware those with long-haired dogs. The shaft catches easily on their fur. Were I to buy another grinder, it would be one with the guard over the shaft."
1,Berman Center Athena Waterproof Mini Massager,This massager is not enjoyable at all. The vibrations are too strong and you are unable to adjust the speed. A metal piece from where the battery is located broke off of mine within 2 weeks of receiving it.
2,Not waterproof,Its not a bad vibe as far as power goes. The power is about average for a vibe this small but when we used it in the hot tub we quickly found out its not waterproof. It would probably work for those times in the shower but if you are looking for full on underwater use then I would look elsewhere.2 stars because it leaked but 4 stars had it worked as advertised.
2,it's ok,"it comes apart very easy, it's a low vibrate it does work under and in water but I would perfer something that doen't come apart so easy."
1,DON'T BUY,This thing broke as I was putting in the batteries. What a waste of money! It's cheap! Don't waste your time or money!
3,"Small product, BIG results!","Don't be fooled by the small size of this pocket rocket - it packs a big punch! Almost too much so, and with no ""slower"" speed setting, it loses a star for that. The other star comes off because it isn't the quietest thing in the world (and while my husband and I enjoy using it together, sometimes I just want a bit of ""time to myself"" without him getting involved!) - the sound is a bit of a give-a-way unfortunately! But hey, for the price, I really shouldn't complain- it certainly manages to ""get the job done!"""
5,Fantastic!,"I must admit after reading a few of the reviews on here I wasn't sure if this would be a good product. It's a fantastic product & well worth the $6.40, which is not a bad price at all! It comes discreetly packaged when you open the amazon box and I was surprised at how quiet it was. It definitely works well and it does its job extremely well. I would buy this product if you are looking for something that is compact, quiet, and a guarantee that there will pleasure."
3,"Great while it lasted, but it only lasted 6 months.","This is a wonderful toy and it feels great, but it has flaws. If you use it for too long after a certain point of usage, it will start to get pretty warm. this isn't exactly a bad thing in terms of pleasure, but hot electronics are never good. It fall apart easily. you can't turn it off without opening it accidentally most of the time. In the beginning it was slightly quiet, but after being used for less than a year, it's become embarrassingly noisy, and that's a big nono when you're living with roommates or trying to listen to something while you go at it.It was nice while it lasted, but I'm currently looking for something to replace it. The last straw was today when my roommate teased me for the loud buzzing sound coming from out of my room.If you wan a long term toy, get something different."
2,Ok,This product is Ok and is easy to take with.However it has done little to help relieve my migrans.
2,Too much power!!!,"This item would only be effective on someone with no feeling at all! Waaaaay too much for an ordinary person!I would send it back, but then I would have spent $10 total shipping here & back for a $5 item-hardly worth it.Unless you are numb, this item will put you through the wall! I do not recommend it."
4,"Little, but gets the job done.","I was skeptical at first because of the size, but it gets the job done. Its small but you can take it anywhere, it fits right in your purse. My husband even liked it being used on him. I only gave it a 4 star because, when you go to turn it off, if you turn to much it comes apart."
2,Pleasant but short lived,"I really like the product design, the motor died after a couple of months. I found Lucid Dream #14 by Doc Johnson to be a better substitute for the lipstick-sized clitoral stimulator."
1,Don't waste your money!,This product was made very cheaply. The first time I tried to put the battery in (not included) the metal thing that touches the battery fell apart. I ended up throwing the whole thing away. Don't waste your money on this product.
2,You get what you pay for,"The first thing I noticed when I opened the box is how cheap the product/plastic looked. By the second use, it felt apart and just stopped working. The idea and design behind this is good but the delivery sucks. If you want to wast $6 go right ahead. I should have gotten a few fancy cups of coffee instead."
2,It's ok...,"My wife was not impressed with this vibe. For the price, it works and thats about the best she said. She prefers a variable speed vibe as this was ""too much"" to start out with."
5,OMG!!,I just got this 20 mins ago.. and OMGGG 2 minutes was all it took.. i do recommend letting the tips soak in some warm water for a while for comfort and putting a small dab of lube.. I use high quality batteries so the performance is greatly enhanced.. BUT OHHH MYYY GREAT STRONG VIBRATIONS.. I SCREAMED WITH GLEE!!!
1,defective product,"there was a flimsy piece of metal inside that fell out once i opened it, i was surprised due to the great ratings, but it does not work and hasn't since i took it out of the package. i am disappointed to say the least, especially since this product is not eligible for refunds :("
5,Surprisingly small and powerful.,"It's really quite small, you can tuck it away anywhere. Also it's the simplest thing ever, just twist to turn on"
4,Get's the Job Done Quickly.,"I Like it, I love it, can't find myself separating from it. This little sucker is quite powerful. It's cheap and portable. However, it isn't made to be the most durable. I still like it, you won't regret this little guy. Greaaaaat Vibes, not noisy, cute ;)"
5,Awesome lil thing,"LOVE this it is very good and a little loud, but when your alone who cares it certainly does its job....."
1,Terrible Quality,"Just a waste a money. Didn't even work, but the quality is SO poor, that you can tell it would have been lame even if it did work...."
1,Cheaply made,I didn't see anything special about it. It was very cheaply made. The covers were a bit hard. Not something I would like. Stopped working when I was testing batteries. Probably wouldn't last through much use anyway. I was surprised at how flimsy it was. It doesn't look like it would be water proof either. I can't believe Dr. Berman put her name on this piece of junk.
3,For the price its not bad,Its very powerful and has different tips for different feelings. Drives my GF nuts. Its single speed. The price is great. The only issue is its really easy to break the metal clip that the battery sits on. I broke one and bought another. They hold up fairly well if your careful with them. For the price its a great deal. Design could be improved upon.
5,"Take a chance, otherwise you will never have a chance.","This has to be the ultimate job search reference book available on the market today. I have purchased several books with similar claims in the past; however they never lived up to my expectations. What sold me to write this review is the fact that the book acts like a personal mentor to you during the whole job hunt process. It gives you a tremendous confidence booster and opens up doors of opportunities for you to really get creative and result driven. Don't fool yourself by thinking that activity and accomplishment is the same thing. This book is all about accomplishments and results. I would highly recommend this book to anyone, whether you are a new grad or a veteran, this book will show you how to maximize your worth in the market today. Believe me when I say this, a wrong job hunt approach can really be discouraging to your self image (been there done that), so do it right the first time. Buy this book, you can't go wrong."
4,Guerilla Thinking,"A host of ideas I had never considered.This book is highly recommended.Really, it seems to have inside information from the recruiter side of the job hunt. check it out."
5,I'm not a Tori fan.,"Every other review on this album seems to have been written by a Tori fan.I'm not one. In fact, until her last two albums, she was less than good. Maybe even terrible.However, if you're in the rave scene, you've heard this track; it's definitely one of the best and most popular out there, but it has been played out. Since you don't hear it at parties anymore, may I personally highly reccomend it?"
1,"As an overview, OK otherwise not the best.","This is an OK sort of a volume, not the best effort from Acanthus. It is essentially nothing more than a directory with very little details about Mr. Candela and Mr. Carpenter. The fact that they were combined into a single volume is, for me, irritating, as both deserve their own volume. While a brief comment and select floor plans accompany most of the buildings covered, I would have preferred a much more expansive volume showing many of the apartments as they appear today, as it were. A disappointing and lack-lustre offering from Acanthus."
5,Lincoln Logs,These are great for under 3 years old ecspecially if your kids like to put stuff in their mouth. Nice sized fun and chunky pieces to play with. There is a barn one too.
5,Jetsons The Movie,A very enjoyable animation from Hanna-Barbera team. Classic cartoon series with a addition of songs. Recommended for the whole family.
3,Some Good and Some Blah,"I was so excited when I found this old movie on my shelf. I remember liking it a lot back in the day when I was a kid. This time when I watched it though, I was surprised to see it drag in several places. George goes through the same comic routine of getting caught in the sprocket machine several times, and it takes forever for someone to come up with an idea of staying in the plant after working hours to figure out what's causing all the trouble.Then again, the film has some definite highlights. It's fun seeing the wonders of the Jetsons' new home, and most of the songs are surprisingly good, except for the one or two awful rap songs. Rap was EVERYWHERE at this time. Most embarassing thing of the 90's if you ask me.The movie starts getting a little environmentally preachy near the end, without much comic relief to lighten it up and make it easy to swallow.Good for a rental if you have kids I guess, but the TV show had to be a lot better."
3,Mildly helpful,"If you need advanced Forecasting Methods and like the thick mathematical language of typical textbooks, this is for you."
2,More of a reference text,"I used this text for an undergraduate course in Industrial Forecasting. Unfortunately, the text is not very good if you actually want to learn new material from it. It is better suited as a reference text for you to look up equations and concepts after you have already learned them."
4,Teaching by playing.,"This updated sequel to Toddlers Together presents a variety of fun and educational activities for children 1 -3 years old to do with their parents, caregivers or teachers. Children's activities are organized by themes and season; each one lists skills, suggested language (specific activity words), materials needed, activity description and ways to engage the class. Although written for preschool teachers, many of these activities can easily be done at home by an energetic parent or caregiver."
1,Junk,"This product is a box o' junk. My son got this for Christmas this year and it is not even worth whatever the person paid for it. The hat fell apart within three days (and he hardly played with it - just wore it on his head a few times) - the metal rim around the hat came undone and now there is a sharp metal point sticking out through the cloth on the hat, which is obviously dangerous. I contacted the company and they have not responded."
2,Not impressed.,"My daughter likes the hat but I worry each time she plays with it that is will fall apart. I will be happy and amazed if it lasts until the magic show in 2 weeks. The outer box was crushed along with the actual package. Packaging was not put together well in the first place. And like the other review, most of the content is junk."
3,"Good, phone, some problems.","This phone is good for putting in your bedroom, or im an office. I wouldn't recommend it for going long distances, or as your main house phone, due to the range. The main problem with this phone is that there is no headset plug... making it hard to type or do activitys that require use of your hands while talking on it. Other than that, this is a cool looking great phone for a kids bedroom, or small office, and is call waiting compatble."
4,Worth every penny.,This item was purchased for my son who is a Spongebob fan. We have enjoyed watching all the action from the begining to the end. My item wasn't packed quite properly as the plastic case was cracked and unusable but the dics were in fine condition.
1,polder stainless reversible dishrack,"I should have listened to reviews I read. The rack does not hold plates/bowls securely. The utensil bucket is not deep or narrow enough to hold common utensils upright. The curled edges of the tray (structural integrity) in drain position, hold water and will back up, and drain upon counter, unless back end is raised. The welds of the rack are not aligned properly. Thus wobbling port to starboard as it is loaded. One of the welds is soft and will not last. The only winners... shipping. Item returned. Seek alternate dish racks!"
1,Disappointing,"I was very happy with the just strawberries, as I like to add fruit to my cereal year round. These peaches were disappointing as they were very hard and even after soaking in milk parts were inedible."
4,"Great crackers, terrible packaging","I used to buy these delicious crackers at my health food market, but they stopped carrying them. I was happy to find them at Amazon, but when my order arrived, they were all broken up, many in very small pieces. I asked for a replacement, and it came quickly, but again, many of the crackers were broken up. It doesn't look like the packaging is going to improve any time soon, if ever, and it's a shame. When I bought them at my health food store, they were all in one piece, so obviously, it's possible."
5,The truth about Montreux,"Brilliant and accurate account of what went on at the Montreux Clinic. McLintock tells it as it was.. Children being held against their will in a non-medical facility. Non-profit Society funds being used to pay a private company owned by Peggy-Claude-Pierre and her husband David Harris.Very sick children and young adults being cared for by other patients and recruited coffee shop staff from about town in Victoria British Columbia. Secrecy and isolation. This book should be a training manual for emerging countries setting up their human rights code. A very compelling book. It displays Montreux and its owners as who they really are, a fiddle player and a retired waitress.. How they got their recognition and publicity to launch their international scam is cleanly laid out in this book.. I could not give it a higher recommendation.. Anyone who has thought of sending their loved one(s) to a private treatment facility of any type must read Anorexia's Fallen Angel..."
1,Hafiz vs. Daniel Ladinsky,"If you want to read the poetry of Daniel Ladinsky, buy The Gift. A lot of people seem to like Ladinsky's poetry. Just don't make the mistake of thinking that these are translations of poetry by Hafiz. They're not. They're all-new, all-original English language poems by Ladinsky. I don't know why he publishes his own work under the name of Hafiz.If you want to read the poetry of Hafiz in English translation, consider Hafiz of Shiraz by Peter Avery."
1,Hold your nose here!,"I have got no idea whether these translations are genuine or not. The only thing I know, for sure, is that they really stink.Ya, for sure, after all these eons, the Sun does not say to the Earth, ""You owe me."" How completely stupid. Sometimes, people owe one another, and sometimes they don't. This nonsense about a speaking Sun and a listening Earth doesn't bring anything to the table!""I saw the Earth smiling"" ??Oh, get a clue. Go buy some real poetry, not this nonsense!! ""Real"" poetry might be (take your pick) Li Po, Chaucer, Shakespeare, Yeats, Marlowe, Dante, Virgil, Homer, Eliot, Pound... and I'm not going to waste any more time here! Outta here!"
5,What I was Looking For,"I first heard this when I was very young, back in the late fifties and have been looking for it for years. Very pleased that I found it and it was in good condition."
5,Grace at Ashley River EL.,"I liked when we read The Last american rainforest,because it was cool.I liked when she brougth the pictuers and the fallsools. The book was very, very, very, very good. I learend a lot of stuf."
2,Weak Album,"The tracks on this album are just not inventive. They come off redundant with lots of CORNY lyrics. Her first album ""Different"" blows this one out of the water. That is why I took a chance on her next album ""Stronger"". Luckily, I purchased my copy of ""Stronger"" on ebay for $3. Glad I didn't pay more than that."
2,just can not move my feet to this..........,"i have to say this is a waste of my, and your time. not good enough to be sold for 10 dollars. be very afraid of this cd. you should give up music, and do what you are really good at- combing your blonde hair. just another good looking blonde- no talent."
5,I love logic problems and this book has lots of them.,"The author says that it is not only the cards in your hand that determines your bid. He then goes on to prove it by showing a number of hands. For each of those hands he explains how the bid would be different in four different situations, i.e., depending on the bags, the bids by the other players,the score, whether its end game, etc. The explanations and the logic are very clear.The book makes you think. It brought out many ideas I had not thought of. I love to read about spades almost as much as play it, and this book was really enjoyable."
5,How Not to Lose at Spades,This is a wonderful book for the beginner to the advanced player. It's easy to read. When you put Mr. Strichman's strategy and techniques into pratice you will be winning more games. Definately a keeper!
5,"I knew it said ""giant"", but wow!","This litter box is enormous! Since we have 8 cats, and go through litter pretty quickly, I just throw two 25 lb boxes of cat litter in here at once, and then let the cats slowly work their way down, This litter box is thick and sturdy, and great for my fairly large cats (one is a 20 lb Maine Coon type cat, so he needs his space). I also live the compartments, which I use to hold a liter box scoop, and a supply of plastic grocery store bags to dispose of the cat litter.Thanks to the size of these, we've been able to narrow our litter boxes down from seven to four. Two of these, a small one upstairs, and one of those green Tidy Cats Breeze (which I'd ideally use for all cats, but only one of the eight uses it)."
5,Excellent design!,I purchased this litter pan for a new kitten after viewing it at one of the cat shelters. The sides are higher than most pans so it helps keep the litter in the pan. Another nice feature is the 2 separate areas on the side that I use for the scooper and other items I use for cleaning the litter pan.
5,Great large pan for two cats!,"This is the second one I've ordered; based on the performance of the one I ordered last year, it easily earns five stars. Both my large tabby and my small arthritic Abby use the pan without any problems, and it's easy to clean. Plus the order was delivered in less than 24 hours - Thanks, Amazon!!"
5,"Perfect for a ""big boned"" cat","I purchased this product on behalf of my parents and their 22 pound cat who was prone to peeing wherever the fancy struck. After many months of trying to remedy this problem, we finally decided to get the biggest litter box we could find. This box is huge! Both household cats were immediately attracted to it, getting inside to dig around (what fun!). The 22 pound cat finally had a box that he could fit in without hanging over edges or being scrunched into a too small space. He showed his satisfaction by peeing in the box, and he has had no outside-the-box mishaps since. I don't personally care for the side compartments, but the results are well worth the minor inconvenience. Be prepared to use a lot of litter; a minimum of 30 pounds in my experience."
5,Phone,This phone is excellent. It is a great color blue. It is an easy handle phone.This phone is great.
2,review of live performance,"Hello,The performance was ok but not up to their past records.If you are considering buying America's new cd's I would suggest you save your money.It would be better spent on their older(original) versions if you do not have these.I have also listened to the Grand Caiman CD and it is also not up to the older versions.I will stick to the older and better material.It is a shame since I was hoping for more from this group.Newer is not always better."
4,"Stellar content, not-so-stellar printing","As a given, the quality of the content is unsurpassed. Even to this day, Shakespeare must surely remain as one of the finest craftsmen (if not the finest) of the modern English language, and all English-speakers would do well to harken to the Bard.Anyway, this printing (hardcover) is very attractive, at a distance. The leather (if it's genuine) is not of the highest quality, the pages have a tendency to stick together upon first opening of the book, a result of which is the rare white streak in the text. On a more positive note, the glossary at the back is of frequent use, though it lacks some words esoteric to this modern, American reader. I haven't really read their notes that also come in the back, so I can't comment on them.However, the fact that one can obtain the complete works of Shakespeare, hardcover in leather, for a reasonable price, itself makes this edition desireable."
1,I didn't enjoy this book,I thought the book was not very good. And thats all I gots to say about that!
2,Not what I was expecting,"Perhaps it is my naievete with this fellow's work. But I was very disappointed. I also do not believe this is the version of the title I had added to my wish list on Amazon anyway. But this is what they sent.I wanted the disc for the favorite melody of the song ""We Gather Together."" But there is so much improvisation and this rendition is so cluttered with extraneous notes and riffs that the tune is unrecognizable to me.Very disappointed and I will be exchanging it."
5,A MESSAGE FROM THE AUTHOR,"Hi! I am Rita Nayar.I am writing a message here to provide an email address to those of you who wish to get in touch with me!It is rita_nayar@hotmail.comPlease do write as I would love to get your thoughts, comments, feedback or simply an acknowledgement of my book."
1,What a Bad Joke!!!!!!,"This is DOVE approved. Another Bad Joke!Don't waste your hard earned cash!Don't waste your time!Supposedly a Christian? movie.That would be an oxymoron, with strong emphasis on the word ""moron"".If I said that it was religious garbage, and trash, I would be seriously minimizing the facts.Multiple Thumbs Down!!!!!Even my garbage can was not a fitting burial place. 8>("
1,worst Christian movie,"I hated it! Couldn't wait to finish it! I could of just stopped watching it but thought I might as well watch it to make it worth my $2.99....It wasn't even worth that! There was no plot, too many stories left untouched, and a terrible ending! The bible was only mentioned once other than that it was referred to as ""the book"" through out the movie. I understand they were trying to show real life temptations and difficulties faced in a Christian's life... but this movie was a failure."
2,Not all that,"I have read half of the book so far, and I must say that it is not impressing me. Well it does give the stories of how Gotti came to rule the Gambino family, I have to keep checking the title to see if I am reading about Gotti. Like I said, I have only read half of the book, but so far, most of it has been about Sammy Gravano. Well he did play a large role in Gotti coming to power, I think that so far to much of this book has been given over to him. When I finish the rest of the book, I will let all of you know if my opinion of the book has changed"
5,Great Book,not the best don ever but certainly the most charasmatic. A great book for an exciting don.
2,Repetitive Slow Read,"With proper editing, this book could have been reduced to a quarter of its length. Other than being extremely repetitive, the book is also a slow read. It is not surprising the authors are journalists. You should read Sammy the Bull's Underboss first, then pick up this book to get a different perspective."
4,Costume,"The costume was super cute and I got a ton of compliments at my best friend's Halloween party!The sizes are always hard to figure out, and it was a little big, but no biggie!"
2,Meh.,"Fairly disappointed in this costume. The lace petticoat underneath was sewn in crooked so it looks uneven from the front, and the little red hood is falling apart. Lots of loose threads popping out everywhere. Most importantly, however: it runs WAY too big. I'm a pretty true size 'large' but this costume was hanging off me on the sides and front, so incredibly unflattering. I'd have gone a size down but then the dress would have been too short and I'm not quite willing to let my bum cheeks hang out. So if you do plan on wearing this or ordering it be certain to order a size smaller than usual.This costume is certainly cute, but it shall not be worn by me this Halloween."
2,Almost operational,"The GPS works fine, its the radio part that is not working. It receives signal fine but, will not transmit out. I am calling Garmin to get mine replaced or fixed. Bought it for military deployment and disappointed with the condition of the new product."
1,Broken,I had to send the first one back and get a second one. The first one I received was broken...the on and off switch did not work. I had to remove the battery and put it back in for the unit to turn on. When it was on the electronics on it were all wrong. The calendar was in the wrong spot along with the moon phases...Unit was a total disaster. The second one I received seems to be working so far. Will have to wait and see.
2,Polling & Transmit Problems,"I'm beginning to wonder if I made a bad choice, in buying the Rino 530HCx radios. I purchased 3 of them so that my sons and I could keep track of each other's location, without having to talk and spook game. Well, when they work right, polling the other person is great, but they don't always update, even if you are not very far from each other! Sometimes this can be as close as 100 yards! Also, when someone transmits, sometimes it sounds like the other person is pushing on and off the transmit button. Again, distance doesn't seem to matter so it's not a matter of being out of range. We have also noticed that sometimes the map doesn't show that your location has changed, even though you have moved quite a distance. We found that by turning off the unit, and starting it back up again puts you in your correct location.I checked online at Garmin, and the operating system of the Rinos are up to date. Hopefully they are working on a fix for this problem!"
4,Product does what it's made to do,"I'd gotten tired of shaving my legs every other day and thought I'd try an epilator instead. (I had been given an ""Epilady"" back in the 1980's and it was NOT a product I'd buy again).HOWEVER this Panasonic shaver/epilator is easy to use (I have the model that works plugged in-not cordless!). I haven't needed to use this thing in a week!! WONDERFUL stuff, and I would reccommend it to anybody else sick of shaving their legs...it WORKS."
1,the adapter was spoiled in no time,Although the product is good the adapter went wrong and another adapter cannot be found in any store
5,"Amazing Reference for Pregnancy, Birth, and Baby Care","Beautifully adorned with mothers and babes, this collection allows the Western mother and mother-to-be to step out of our comfort zone and let mothers' of the world teach us. Packed full of information in an easy-to-read style. Mamatoto offers what no other prenatal/pregnancy book can... spirit and guidance in what often feels like uncharted territory. Enjoy this book completely until it is in tatters- like mine."
1,Buyers beware on this one.,"This was published by Medical Economics and no author is listed. If you're a true herbalist, expect this book to be slanted to the drug cartel's viewpoint.Andrew Bentley (Alfalfa and Buckwheat) aptly pointed out that info is left out and it says some data is not available, but it is.Jerry Cott in his review points out their report on St. John's Wort. Do you really think this was not done on purpose? Imagine the dollars lost if people stopped taking the drugs that this herb will sometimes help.Be sure to read what the pharmacist said. I applaud you as your lively hood depends on this type of manipulation of the truth.Buyers beware on this one if you want the truth."
2,Phoning it in,"In his earlier books, Sandford's characters were fascinating, his plots were gripping and his prose was clever and really descriptive. Now the books are very bare-bones. Almost all dialogue. Davenport sleep-walks through the story. The villian is underdeveloped and not interesting. You don't really care what happens, you just put the plot-points together -- click-click-click. Also, there were huge plot holes -- the whole town is involved with one felony or another and, c'mon, after all he's been through, wouldn't Davenport have the slightest inkling that Letty might become a target? Compared to, say, Rules, Eyes, Silent, Certain or Winter ... this book doesn't hold up. Sandford could do much better, but I get the feeling he doesn't really care. And, judging from some of the gushing reviews from his fans, no longer needs to."
4,I like it,I love John's Sanford's writing. I do not think he is as sharp with Lucas as he was in earlier books.
4,Good Sandford Thriller,"Sandford exhibits a number of his talents as a writer here, including well-focused character development, dead-on place description (northern Minnesota) and careful, devious plot evolution. You really can't go wrong with a Sandford/Davenport novel and this is no exeption. And the beauty is, if you're an avid Sandford fan, there is such a long body of work to keep you occupied long into many evenings."
4,"""A Twelve Year Old Grabs Lucas's Heart""","In a small town in Northern Minnesota, two people are found hanged from a tree naked. Lucus and Del are sent there by the Governor to get answers fast. They find the town's people very tight lipped, but not for the reason's Lucas and Del may think. There is much going on in this little town near the Canadian Border. The key for all the questions can be found in a twelve year old girl named Letty, who has a key to Lucas's heart too. There are lots of emotions here and this one was hard for me to put down."
2,Will we see the real Lucas again?,"I loved the first 9 or 10 Pery Novels. However, in Sanford's past several Prey novels, we haven't seen the old Davenport. He's much softer and kinder. This book, the characterazation of Davenport is just as mild and bland as ever.This story open with two bodies that are found strung up in a tree. Soon Davenport and Co. are call in to to solve the case. I don't want to give to much away, so that's all I'll say about the plot.I did like the Character of Letty. I liked her a lot. I hope to see her in other Prey books.I guess I'm used to the old Davenport and the way he dealt with problems. I haven't seen this in several books.The writing is pretty good. There are some nice plot twists. I kept on reading Naked Prey in hope to see the old Davenport, but that never happened."
2,Is it just me or does anyone else care?,"I read this book via audio. I like the writing style and the story was fair, but I will agree with other reviews, all the crime going on in this small town lost some credibility and was hard to believe, but I know its a fictional story. The part that I could not stand is the constant barrade of blasphemy's with GD and JC. I mean come on, cant you use another form of ""filler""? I would of rather heard sh%% or something. It was overkill and completely ridiculous. I wished I would of counted, it had to be 100+. In addition Mr. Sandford must quit promoting his liberal agenda in his books regarding, the republican party and he must deal with his religious issues in a more constructive way! Disappointed...."
4,"Not his best, but I still enjoyed","Being a huge fan of the Prey series, I think the story could have been better in some areas. That being said, I still enjoyed. Though Lucas is the main draw for me, I really enjoyed the character Letty. Apparently we'll be reading more about her in future novels, which is a good thing. The story was kind of weak, yet entertaining at the same time. Nothing more to say, other than I'm looking forward to what comes next for Lucas and Letty."
4,I Love John Sandford!,"This is one of the better of the Prey series. A little predictable, but, still good, I think."
2,Disappointing,"Like others have mentioned, Lucas Davenport's character is becoming lackluster and is only mildly interesting in this story. His character has been known for his feistyness and bravado but that isn't apparent in this latest incarnation of Lucas. He actually takes a back-seat to his co-hort Del Capslock. I also found the story difficult to follow, too many threads trying to hang together and too many characters. Sanford's writing is also going downhill....I mean those run-on sentences have got to stop! I have read every Prey book to date and have not been impressed with the last couple. I am hoping that Sanford either finds a better editor or spends a little more time using his grammar check. Otherwise he is going to lose this long-time fan of his."
2,Where's Lucas,"As another reviewer wrote, the first prey were very good, the last lacking, the only one that was worst is the one before this one. Lucas spends 50% of the book riding back and forth up an icy road at 80 miles in his Acura. Since you know fairly early who the main culprit is , you only have to add up the body count and see when he going to figure out who is the main killer. I won't give away ending but an average detective should have known way before Lucas finally figure it out."
3,Exactly as advertised,"NAKED PREY is exactly what you think it should be- a fast paced page turner, fairly predictable, but with enough action and suspense to make you want to finish. As this was my first ""Prey"" novel I haven't formed any attachment to the characters, but I can see pretty clearly why this series has been successful; it pushes all the right buttons: A quirky hero with a family that is likeable, a convoluted mystery that gives you something to focus on other than the pedestrian writing, and eccentric criminals and supporting cast. This book is not a great example of the genre, but it could be used as the model for books of this type. Going into the plot really doesn't make sense as I'm sure one ""Prey"" book is pretty much like another (Anybody not know how our tomboy heroine's situation was going to be resolved?), but that being said, if another came across my path I probably would give it a read."
2,Beginner magazine with liberal bend,"Very good magazine on the merits of investing and personal finance. Unfortunately, in recent years, Pat Regnier has tilted this magazine towards the liberal side (owned by Time Warner who also owns CNN), arguing that American should accept higher taxes. I enjoyed the magazine until it started to make comments on tax policy...have transitioned to Kiplinger's and Smart Money instead."
2,Haven't received this product!!,"I haven't received this product yet, and it has been over a month. A day after ordering, I was notified that my order was processed, but I still have not received the first issue of this magazine. Kind of disappointing, since this was a gift for my boyfriend."
1,"Where have you gone, Declan Sinnot?",Makes you really appreciate the genius arrangements of Declan Sinnot on the previous collaborations.
2,much ado about very little,"This is a fairly drab and banal account of a marginal self-consciously eccentric American composer. In the chapter devoted to tuning I should have thought the authors would have either critiqued or defended their various extravagant claims, which to a reasonable person who knows something about this will seem so much numerological fetishism. They did neither."
2,Bob Marley & The Wailers Gabon 1980,"Bob Marley & The Wailers Gabon 1980 [Meldac (Japan) MECI-25103]Low-quality bootleg.15 tracks. 76:09.

2,WebClasses Not Included,"I expected this tome to include coverage on the new Visual Basic 6.0 WebClasses. Guess what? Webclasses are not even mentioned in this book. What material is covered is good but rather basic. The title of this book could be ""VB5 for Web Development""."
1,No detail at all on the things touted in the title!,I expected complete info on DHTML examples and Webclasses. This was a very disappointing book
2,Maya Quickstart,"This book is okay for some quick notes on shortcut keys and such, however, I have yet to find it helpful in learning Maya from the beginning. It's images and short descriptions assume you already know how to use Maya and are just flipping thru reference books such as this for little reminders and idea-triggers. The only page I've found to be very useful is the first page of shortcuts. The rest I could have lived without paying for...but then, I had to learn this for myself as this was a required textbook for my class."
1,not good,"Maya is (I'm told) an immensely powerful tool. This book leaves out the crucial first step of any file; basic file creation. Although the back of this book indicates that it is for begininng and intermediate Maya users, chapter one jumps immediately from a description of the toolbar layout, to manipulating an already finished drawing of a shark. Ummmm. how the hell did that shark come into existence, Danny? Although every other Visual Quickstart book I've used is terrific they get very low marks for this one. Hey publisher! Do NOT put ""revised and expanded"" on the cover again if you continue to omit a basic drawing chapter."
3,"Hey, check out Amazon's review!","""Haunting and unforgettable, the Nymphaeum will uplift your spirit, soothe your soul and transcend you to the mystical secret haven of the nymphs. ""HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!"
5,WOW!,"Wow! It is all here. Tradition, Scripture, logic and reason, everything! A must have! If non-Catholics are trying to put words in your mouth, just open the catechism and see what the Church really believes."
2,too expensive,"With all the catechisms available, it's just not worth dropping this much money on one. to those looking for good catechisms, i advise finding another one"
2,Very Disappointing,"This book which could have been an excellent eBook reference fails to deliver. The main problem is that the categorical numbers, which are present in the hard company, are missing. This makes very hard to find specific items having to do with the Catholic faith. I would recommend the hard copy for anyone wanting this Catechism."
1,"THIS IS A BLANK PAGE, NO TEXT",BEWARE OF THIS ITEM! Big tip-off 12kb for a book of over 700 pages. For $2.39 I got a blank page! Don't waste your money til Amazon gets this right and actually makes the text available. To their credit they did refund my money immediately.
5,A Great Help,"I bought this book right after reading The Complete Idiot's Guide to Understanding Catholicism, and it was my best buy so far.I was born and raised Catholic, but since I moved to a mostly non-Catholic town, I have been constantly asked why this and that. I found most of my answers in this book. It explains what Catholics thoughout the world believe in common and it's easy to read and understand. It explains from passages on the Bible to Catholic tradition.This is a must have for every Catholic home, and a constant source of knowledge and answers."
5,essential,"To be able to have the Catechism of the Catholic Church available so easily is wonderful. when in doubt about what the Church actually teaches, about a multitude of things, just look it up and find the true teaching. A true blessing to have on Kindel."
5,MUST read for Catholics,This is a very well organized and authoritative book about the teachings of the Catholic Church.
5,informative and straight foward on catholic doctrine,"I found this book to be a very helpful guide in following the path through life, that our Lord has laid out for us. A very valuable reference to clear up any questions on faith that may arise. A Websters type, dictionary of catholicism."
3,Catechism Table of Contents,"I have a ""hard"" copy of the Catechism and of course the content is is invaluable. I wanted a Kindle version for convenience but it needs a table of contents linked to the paragraphs (otherwise it would not be convenient!). After reading the reviews, apparently this version does not have such links. So I will wait to purchase until such links are available."
2,Catechism on Kindle,"The e-book version on my Kindle is difficult to navigate. Unless you know the exact paragraph number of the topic you want to read, it is almost impossible to narrow your search parameters to find what you seek. The 'text to speech' is annoying due to the many numerical references and footnotes on each page. As a reference book, I do not recommend the electronic version. Buy a paperback book instead."
1,SHAME on you,"Sent me a "" very good "" condition book with one page ripped out and another with a ripped in half page. I did not realize this until I was over 400 pages into it. I contacted the seller 2x to request immediate reparation. I WANT TO FINISH READING THIS BOOK WITHOUT HAVING TO BUY ANOTHER ONE from a different seller. Seller DID NOT respond to two e-mail messages asking for help. DON'T BUY!!!!"
2,"Imaginative - but boring. Not ""space opera""","Ok, so it's the third in the RS line. I was hooked with RS, disappointed with Ark, and bored to death with this one. Reynolds has turned Reefer sleeping into a literary device to skip all the stuff he doesn't have time/ doesn't want to write about. And honestly, that ""stuff"" is apparently space travel. So it's ironic to me that an author known for writing about space suddenly has an aversion to it. It occurred to me while reading this that it would make a terrific movie, unlike most scifi I've read that are just too vast to contain on a screen. I don't know if that's an insult or a compliment - maybe both. I'd only suggest reading this one if you just haaaave to know what happens next and have too much time on your hands."
4,good,helps with leg cramps and areas on my back that i canb not reach relaxs the muscles and feels good too
4,solid,"This is a solid well conceived and manufactured massager. It takes all the days pain out of my feet in about 5 minutes which is worth the price alone. Designed with a pronounced hook that is best on self massaging your shoulders, the hook is not so great that it makes massaging others difficult. The 2 front wheels keep it from abraiding clothing and are good for rolling up and down the back. This is best done sitting and reaching over the shoulders. The lower back can be reached holding it with both hands on the same side. It has 2 speeds which are a little slower than the last one I had, these are OK for me and better for my wife. The green is too bright but I can overlook it."
1,Nyko Power Pak Doesn't Work,"Great idea, but it doesn't work. It seems to charge okay, but it's very loose when you connect it to a Color Gameboy, and slips out easily, losing power - and the game. I got two for two kids, and neither one works in either Gameboy."
5,I love The Book,"I love Michael Jackson,so of coarse I am bound to like books about him that.This book was Wonderful,it has alot of information on his songs when he was in the Jackson 5"
2,Oops! Not for all Jura-Capresso,"I ordered this item thinking it could be used for a Capresso drip coffee maker like the MT600, but after I received the item (without any use instructions on the packaging), I heard from Capresso via email this item is only for the grinders/expresso/etc. systems. My mistake. To the trash it goes."
4,over priced,I think these tablets are over priced for a cleaning product. I plan to use some of the less expensive tablets to compare and will check back here soon. $ stars because they do keep the machine functioning well. However our daughter has never cleaned her Jura Capresso in 4 years and only had one minor clog which rectified itself with a little water flush.
3,Overlong and overwrought bio,"Preminger's half hearted attempts at humility don't exactly leave him coming off smelling like a rose (Gypsy or otherwise)and I think he may have watched one too many performance of AUNTIE MAME. While the chapters go by quickly enough, the reader can't help but find this dysfunctional family pretty tough to like or admire. Selfish and mean spirited characters disguised in campy, candy coating."
4,"Fast satrt, plenty of tachnique, but poor quality video","It's a fast way to get start with Lightwave 7, but some fundamental knowladge about Lightwave required. There are some tricks to learn and some tricks helping to guide how to work smart in Lightwave. However, the visual quality was originally designed for VCR quality. Thus, it appears quite poor in DVD format. Not bad to take a look, it just like someone guiding you trhou the project and more interactive than learning from books."
5,excellent music if you like variety,I finally found out what the name was to this song just a week ago and decided to buy it ASAP. I heard this song when I was in Europe not too long ago and wanted to find it but could not till just recently. If you like trance or club music you will probably like this song. It is a good song to dance to as well. And if you like this song I suggest you try another European trance group called Groove Coverage. They just put out a club remix of the song Poison so I hope whoever likes Ingrid will try this as well.
3,Awesome Single - Hope she won't be a 1-hit wonder,"I tried downloading this from the Sony music service ""Connect"" (.99c a song) and it wasn't available for the single ""You Promised Me"", so you would have to buy the entire album ($9.99). The entire album is not all that great. Certainly not worth $10.The Single CD has 3 other versions on it. I think the best one is the radio edit. So, for the $6 you spend for the one song, it may not be worth it. In the meantime, for a few bucks more, you may want to consider buying a CD compilation that has this song on it so you can get more value out of your purchase and see it go longer way. Amazon.com has some compilations with ""You Promised Me"" on it. They range between $12.99 to $15.99."
2,"Cheap price, cheap construction","These flashlights don't feel very sturdy. We'll see how they long they last with regular use. If they break I'll update the review.The colors were different than in the picture. The two smaller ones were blue rather than yellow. It's not an issue of aesthetics as much as visibility. Also, the included 6 volt battery was DOA.Overall: Not horrible enough to return, but disappointing."
5,"Excellent, thorough, simple","This is a really interesting book - if you've never read the literature on ideas then this is a great place to start. It's very well-researched and covers the topic thoroughly, while staying reasonably concise.The author doesn't present any original research or theories but simply collects the relevant information and presents it clearly. I look forward to putting all the advice in this book into practice!"
5,Wonderfully different and familiar at the same time.,My system was in shock at first but it didnot take long for me to embrace it totally! My teenagers want to take the CD to a school dance and play Tuva Groove and Kargyraa Rap. I almost cried listening to Where Has My Country Gone done by Ondar and Willie Nelson. This is not your traditional Tuvan music! There is also a hidden 12 th track on this disc. Its wonderfully insightful and funny. I Love this disc! I understand this is the way the shamans sang in Siberia. ENJOY
1,I did not like it.,I can't believe what is on the music market anymore. This sounds like something that elementary boys would do to get attention drawn to themselves.
2,Not a comparison of methods..only author's judgements,The author obviously has set opinions about the training of horses. Rather than allow the other methods be explained individually the author interjects comparisons and critiques based only on her experiences. This is not an honest explanation of the varying schools of thought about horse training. This is the author's grandstand. If you are already all about very classical horsemanship then this book will support your current methods.
5,A+++++++ book on everything that is Versailles -,"I will not repeat what many other members very eloquently wrote about this treasure. I am just here to confirm all they say is true. This is perhaps the greatest Versailles book there is. The photos are huge and very vivid. You do not just see some soulless catalog images: you see a true achievement in interior and landscape photography. The colors and the mood, which every single frame here displays, are nothing short of magnificent.It truly captures the unique and ever-lasting magic of Versailles.It is huge and heavy, and I, too, store it flat. I feel like it is a very prized book of my collection, and I treat it with the utmost respect that it rightfully deserves. Just like how the authors and the team behind this masterpiece have treated this greatest palace of all times, I too fully cherish its beauty and magnificence."
1,Too Heavy!!!!!,"They are way too heavy! And you can't return them. Don't believe the other reviews. I am a good consumer and buy lots of ""stuff"" off the internet. I am not a paid reviewer. These inserts weigh a lot. You'll be very disappointed. I wasted my money because I can't use them!!!! and can't return them. I am a Medical Esthetician and Engineer for Pharmaceutical."
5,"Hail Mary, Full of Grace","Deirdre Manifold's book on the Fatima story and its connection to world events is absolutely outstanding. She relates the Fatima miracles to events that have occured ever since 1917 in a masterful and scholarly manner, which belies her humble station in life. This particular edition also includes a booklet from the Fatima Crusader, and a wonderful exposition of the comparison of the plan of Jesus Christ versus the plan of Satan, from the late, great Father Denis Fahey. All in all, this is the greatest book bargain I have ever seen.The book, sadly, is a bit hard to come by. But here's the good news. The wonderful folks at Catholic Treasures make it available readily, along with their many other important titles, including all sixty some volumes of the Ancient Christian writers library. Contact them. Peruse their amazing catalog. Pick up this awesome little book. And be richly blessed in the process. God bless."
4,goin' fishing,"This game was a Christmas gift for our grandson who not only loves to fish, but loves to play Monopoly. The perfect combination. He loves it!!"
2,Poor Quality from Sony,"I didn't like the TV, HD sound was not working.HD picture quality is poor, improper color display. On the whole its a not good product from Sony. None of big stores like Best Buy, Circuit City etc... has this TV( I guess it is because of its ppor quality)."
5,Good Structured...,"Since Kasparov, in our times aggressive players prefer to play Sicilian in Najdorf-Schveningen way. The reason is that this defence allows Black not only to equalise the game, and also to give attacking chances. I have personally a lot of books of John Emms, each of these is valuable than other. Because he knows very well how to deliver the issue, and where the cruciai points are. As I have written to John, to everymanchess, yesterday, he can write the same book in"" My by Move.."" style, which provides even the low ELO level players between 1400-1700 to learn and play this opening in their game."
3,Great Tracks but Not a Mix,"This compilation has a lot of excellent dance/club tracks. I was expecting a mix - with club-like transitions between the tracks - but that is not the case. Although it's not what I expected I still enjoy it tremendously and would recommend it if you're just looking for the club tracks, but not a club mix. It's a great workout companion!"
2,A book about a highly overrated television series,The author helped open my eyes to the real truth about the faddish television series. The chapters really contain information about why this show was doomed right from the start. A revealing look at the merchandise used to capitalize on the spy craze at the time and why too many writers and producers planted the fatal kiss to the program. Since reading this book I have sworn off any interest in the show!
2,Could be better!,"This book is only for regressive fans who sympathize for the lost memory of an overestimated TV hack of 007. It's a good table book to be read while waiting in the dentist's office. Otherwise, read it through and sell it off! Otherwise, throw it in your fireplace!"
1,Austin Powers is better!,"What! I love comedy but this TV show really stunk big-time in its third year...good it didn't last long...it was an insult to Bond...completely laughable! The author obviously suffers from regression and he is not alone! Moi, non!"

3,Disappointing,"I was/am a huge October Project fan, but I have to say this album was a disappointment. A couple of the songs retain the energy of October Project and Mary Fahl's voice is as gorgeous as ever, but some of the songs are downright adult contemporary."
5,"Mary Fahl doesnt sing to you, She make love to you","A pleasure that goes beyond the pure pleasure of listening and i cannot just even try to describe it in other way , in this first solo effort the beautifull voice of October Project goes from classical to folk, from folk to jazz from jazz to ballads and from ballads to ethnical influences (italian and mystic oriental in this offering) and she still keeps her canadian identity, the beauty only singers from that country have (i ignore why), this is an album full of class and Fahls voice cant be any more beautifull and sweet , surely she owns one of the most powerfull vocalisation in the whole world even more than the self proclaimed ""Divas"" of........... i dont know what!!!!!Mary Fahl is the best and she doesnt even consider herself such a Godess or something like that, good for herHM"
1,A Huge Mistake--You are WARNED,"Allow me to dissent. This one deserves ZERO stars, not even one. I was eagerly awaiting this CD, and was shocked by it--and not in a good way. To call it a misguided misfire is anything but an overstatement. I found these songs to be fake, calculated, overproduced, and in some cases, plain laughable. I *really* wanted to like this CD, but it's just an embarrassment for Mary, and it left me feeling badly for her. It just goes to prove that October Project's success was truly the result of a collective effort, not just one very talented singer."
4,Valentino Snapshot,A dreamlike reminiscence of a long ago dinner shared by H.L. Mencken and Rudolph Valentino. Well cast and elegantly filmed at the Oviatt building in Los Angeles the film seems to capture the actual evening where two very different 1920s stars crossed paths. The only flaw is the ill-fitting and incorrectly accessorized evening clothes worn by the actor playing Valentino. Odd because every other detail seems perfect. Try it.
1,Horrible Transfer,Universal/Paramount really botched this transfer the extended scenes look fine but the theatrical footage uses the same transfer as the DVD I'd wait for another edition.
3,Be forewarned... DOES NOT HAVE BACK LIGHTING FOR CALLER ID!,"A decent phone for the price - however it does not have backlighting for the caller ID which I had taken for granted. Actually - too the numbers are hard to read, especially if you look at it from any other angle other than dead on (even then it's not so clear).If you plan on using this phone in a bedroom or room with any limited lighting and caller ID is important to you (I can't imagine why else you'd buy this phone if it wasn't) you will want to take the lack of backlighting into definite consideration."
2,Constant hum spoils otherwise good phone,"VTech makes good products, and I have been pleased with other phones from them, but this one has a constant, low-level hum that is audible both to me and my outside callers. Not strongly distuprive but certainly noticable, and consistent regardless of location, other devices, etc. Disappointing problem on an otherwise good product."
4,"Good, but connector seems weak","I somehow ended up buying this to make tea. It is probably for infusing flavors into soups and other large pots of fluid. I usually make tea in a 1 liter bowl so this works well for me. The piece of metal connecting the two halves seems weak and flimsy, but otherwise, this infuser is well built. This infuser does get stained from leaving it in tea too long."
1,Doesn't hold up,I bought 3 for cooking and tea. 1 of them was broken out of the box. The other didn't have a good seal. I don't foresee the other two lasting.
3,Adequate infuser with annoying latch,"Latch is stiff/difficult and hinge a bit wobbly, which makes it less than a joyful experience to work with.Mesh is nice and fine to prevent too many loose bits floating in the brew.Latch/tab for chain is my major problem. Was so excited to find a 2"" infuser that will hold a lot of tea. (I have a big pot with a 2.2"" opening.) However, considering the latch tab (connects the chain to the infuser and serves as latch to infuser) actually makes dimensions closer to 2.5"" in diameter in one critical spot. Pushing the latch to the side allows it to fit in my pot, but also opens the infuser basket latch... Awkward."
3,Terrific Dish; Useful History,"While terribly edited (repeated words and anecdotes, awkward writing, total absence of structure), the stories told in this book shed light not just on the particular women and films addressed, but on how women acclimate to and change male-dominated industries like the movies. The details of these women's lives -- from their decisions about how to package a particular film to their decisions of whether or not to marry -- are illuminating. I'm not a film buff, but I found the book captivating and memorable."
2,Missing most of the good stuff.,"Why don't compilations include all of the top songs? Missing from this list are: ""In My Dreams"" - Dokken, ""Round & Round"" - Ratt, any Iron Maiden, any Van Halen, or any Motley Crue! How do you create a compilation of a decade and not include the biggest bands of that decade? BTW - Anyone check that lineup on Disc 4? I thought this was HEAVY METAL!"
1,Watch out - they don't honor warranty,"I purchased this unit for my wife. Firstly, the reception is poor. But my main beef is that it does not pick up any reception any more. My wife called up and they are refusing to honor the warranty. Its still within the 1 year period, and i have the receipt to prove it, but they say its out of warranty and that is that - so be warned. I'm currently taking the issue up with the BBB."
4,"First bad, and then good, but not best, in manufacturing","The radio I received from the initial shipment held itself to Channel 5 like a hostage (maybe attempting to hold the buyer for a ransom). The power switch was simply defective, and did not do anything. The 3.5mm mini-jack did not hold itself in the ""hole"" on the radio and no audio came out to my stereo at all. The mini-jack and the ""hole"" just don't fit each other. So one hold, the other no hold. Things would be working if they were the other way around.I had to call and returned the set to the Amazon, which rushed me another shipment. This one is working good, except the ""hole"" still is not holding or snapping the jack very well, but much better than the previous set. Other than this, I am happy with this radio."
1,Overrated reviews...nothing i haven't heard before,"This was a typical and very ordinary cd. Nothing on this album is at all new. All Spaeth does really is make up a very dull song, then he plays it backwards and has a brand new very dull song. I am piano lover and this was just not it. I purchased this cd because of the great reviews but it turns out to be a complete waste of time. And that picture looks like it was taken from a high school year book."
4,MP3.com artist makes good...,"I found this artist's music quite a while back on MP3.com, and was impressed by the color of the orchestration and the cleanly described and lyrical moments contrasting with more rhythmic and ethereal sections. The music IS pleasant and relaxing with a serenity to many of the tracks. I would not say that the titanic theme appears multiple times, though I would characterize much of the music as being in a ""film score"" style. For such a young artist to have the grasp of orchestration and melody that Paul Spaeth obviously does is impressive to me. I doubt that this album will be in my top 10 ""mood"" albums, but it IS worth a listen, especially if you like evocative sound in a non-threatening harmonic realm.Stephen JacksonComposer - Countertenor"
4,Amazingly rich CD,"I don't know what's so bad about this CD that some people think it's worth one-two stars.... I downloaded the songs available and just loved it. These melodies are well defined and pure and the songs are just so striking. It's a rich collection of emotions.The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because he's still in college for music composition and he's writing new works and I just can't wait for the new CD. I NEED my ""Cobalt Blue"" though, cause it will probably be a while.. and I am still in awe every time I hear it. Marvelous work!!"
2,Just O.K.,It seemed like a cute idea and my girls thought it was fun for an hour or so but its kinda small and I think I would just get a regular bigger potato head next time.
2,Agree that something was lost in translation,"I was very excited about this book after reading reviews, but after reading it once or two times, it has stayed on the shelf. The book ended, and I couldn't help but think, ""That's it?"" Considering the book was translated, I wonder if that may be the reason for the somewhat bland language. Who knows, the Swedish version could be beautiful. Although the story is so-so, the illustrations are very colorful and attractive. My daughter and I wish a more lively story accompanied them."
2,Nice while it lasted,"Worked great but broke in less than a year. I didn't even use it that much. Fan still runs, but display and other lights don't work."
4,Nice strong cage,"Nice cage for handfeeding baby lovebirds. Was hard to get the top on though, I wasn't strong enough, my son had to put it on for me."
5,Absolute necessity!,I have a 2006 Corolla S. This made it a simple plug n play for the most part. You do have to connect these wires to your headunit wires via crimps or what have you but it saves you from having to strip and cut the wires in your car. Makes for a clean installation in any car. A must have if you're installing an aftermarket into a toyota corolla (03-08).
1,DOES NOT FIT,"Is not even compatible with my 2004 Toyota solara, pins aren't even close to matching. Size not even close either, waste of time and money."
5,Didn't use it.,i gave it five stars cause it is cheap considering you don't need to splice your factory wiring. But I didn't use it since I'm using signal cables for my setup.
2,Ineffective design,The profile of the jaw makes for unreliable clamping as the lower portion with the pipe holding recesses makes contact before the tops and the jaws tilt in. The magnets that hold the jaws are also weak. I wouldn't recommend this tool and I'd return it if I was allowed too.
2,You Don't Always Get What You Pay For,"The product description promise's eight specific cheeses, but, also advises that their may be exchanges for cheeses out of stock. Well I got the eight cheese with three substitutes. I don't beleive that this is the greatest ratio for a product that offers specific items. If you can't supply what you offer don't sell the item! Will not buy from this company again if the products may be substituted."
4,Great Book!,"I enjoyed reading the book, and examining what at times were too tiny notations on the floor plans in the book, but not paying for it. At $75 list, it's not a book you'll casually purchase. At $350 in the used market, moreso.I was a bit surprised at the fact that the authors stayed away, as much as possible, from words used only by architects (loggia, for example) but were able to keep the book both scholorly and entertaining."
1,Considered it inedible,"I'm an adventurous eater, and have tried a wide variety of things. I'm also not exceptionally fussy although of course I have preferences like anyone else. However, I have to say, this qualifies as one of the worst things I've ever tried. I only took two sips, then threw the rest away, and rinsed out my mouth with water. Nothing about it was good, and I don't consider it a product sufficiently developed that it should have even been released for sale. The texture, freshness, taste, and mixability all were seriously lacking. To my mind, why would anyone consume something this bad, when there are so many other options available? I note that some reviewers who liked it doctored it so much that I'm assuming you could barely detect this in the rest of the ingredients anyway. So if you're going to do that, then maybe it will work for you. Straight? Ick."
2,Not much to this,"This was the size of a novella. Not much to it, and no new information was given. Edward Austen Leigh's Memoirs of Jane Austen was much better and told us much more about Jane Asuten.I give it 2 stars because at least it provides for us drawings of Jane Austen's homes and of some of her brothers. I like having that for reference."
5,One of the best purchases....,"...I've ever made. These speakers (including Aperion's 12"" sub) are incredible. I've got the 7.1 setup teamed with Onkyo's DS898 A/V receiver and have been rocking for nearly 8 months. It doesn't matter whether I'm watching ""Fight Club"" or listening to Boney, the sound is always impeccable. They're beautifully constructed and while not made of solid hardwood their veneer is much, much better than any vinyl-wrapped speaker I've come across. The construction is solid----each satellite weighs 11-12 lbs. Sure there are better systems out there. I seriously doubt you'll find a better one for the price. To top it all off the Aperion sales folks are the BEST I've ever dealt with---in any line of business (that includes USAA Insurance and Banking, who are unbelievable!). You just can't go wrong with these speakers."
2,Not What They Used To Be!,I've worm Wigwam socks for years with work boots and running shoes. They were heavy and sturdy. These socks are neither; I developed a toe hole in one pair the first wearing. I'll be looking around for a replacements.
5,IT HELPS US HIRE GREAT SALES PEOPLE,"This book is right on. My associates and I use the methodology from Hire With Your Head to sucessfully find, assess, and hire great sales people in record time. If you have a real need to hire the best, this book is a must read!"
1,Hire With Your Head: Using POWER Hiring to Build Great Teams,"I was very dispointed with this book. If Lou Adler wasn't so busy trying to criticize hiring managers, he might have had time to write about how to effectively build great teams. Hiring the Best: A Manager's Guide to Effective Interviewing by Martin Yate is a better book to invest your time in."
5,Relaxing and Gorgeous,"My daughter chose this CD at the library at Christmastime when she was 3 and has been listening to it ever since, nearly every night, to fall asleep to. It's just gorgeous, with voices that seem to transcend this world. Lying next to her while she falls asleep, with her listening to this by her own choice, is a spiritual experience for me as a mom. You can imagine how lovely is it, then, when seasonally appropriate. If chorale music appeals to you, definitely get this without hesitation."
3,Mindless Entertainment? I think not...,"So, I'm in a foreign country where no one speaks English and I thought it would be a better time if I had something familiar from home, like a Tim Allen book of humor. I was looking for a little mindless entertainment...Allen's book is not just mindless entertainment, however, it actually makes you think about complex physics way beyond those gadgets and things you built in high school. I actually enjoyed thinking a little.Although it really wasn't my cup of tea, per se, I was kind of amazed that he could write about something so ordinary as a weekend and it would be the slightest bit interesting. Because if you actually examine the plot of the book, IT'S JUST NOT THERE. But, then again, he's not really there either..."
2,Looking for a funny book? You won't find it here.,"I was really dissapointed with this new addition by Tim Allen. I had the pleasure to read his first book and found it very entertaining, this one was quite the opposite.If you do buy this book I suggest also getting a good dictionary to go along with it because half of the terms will be way over your head.Although I admit it is quite deep, it tends to ramble on about physics and makes for very few laughs."
4,A fun book,"Having grown up with the Huntley-Brinkley report and watching them at all the conventions, I truly enjoyed this book. Especially interesting is how Brinkley trashes Jesse Helms."
3,"OK, but not great",This antenna works but picks up signals at about 20 degrees from direction it is pointed. I think if it were a little wider I could pick up several other stations without having to turn it. I am a little disappointed in this product based on its advertising and reviews.
3,PictulatesNtheWind,"Bought it 05/09 because of specs and it looks cool; for the most part it works OK but Construction is flimsy and even when getting a strong signal (most stations are 47 mi and in line - Charleston,SC to Cottageville) if there is a wind over 10 mph the picture just pictulates? (freezes and sometimes drops out completely). 25' pole on rotator - engineer. Get a flat unit."
3,Children's Musical,"An amusing children's Musical. Vocals leave a bit to be desired (well, sorry, but the phantom had a voice of an angel...). Has an ""after-school special"" quality to it and would be suitable for younger fans."
1,Way overpriced.,"I express that this product is over priced in that my smart abs' resistance band ripped through with only 6 months use. Now either I replace with pricey replacement part, or discard. How nice."
3,Its okay.,Yet again FUNIMATION is poorly advertising this box set of the ova it only includes the first 13 esp you will need to buy Tenchi Muyo!: Ryo-Ohki Box set as well to complete your series
5,great shoe for less money,super shoe. has velcro that stays. my son loves these shoes easy to get on and off.
4,10 Years Before Charlie Brown's Retirement,"I remember when this special 1st aired on TV. Since I got to witness the debut of most of the Charlie Brown specials made in the 1970's, I had to see this one. It features clips from the original specials and movies (mentioning the success of the long-running Broadway Play ""You're a Good Man, Charlie Brown"") and pulls a plug for the jazz CD Happy Anniversary, Charlie Brown, featuring David Benoit, Dave Brubeck, Kenny G, and BB King (BB King is featured in this special doing a reading of the ""Joe Cool"" theme). It also features interviews with the late, great Mr. Schulz and even Cathy Guisewite, creator of the ""Cathy"" series. The sappy song at the end is a little sappy for me (making it seem a little dated). But this documentary brings back memories of 10 years ago when Charles Schulz wasn't even thinking of retiring!"
4,quality product,"Better quality than the box store inventory. I like the mirrored front and back of door, and inside back panel behind glass shelves. Classy and solid."
4,A great review of Bentley's triumph,"After three years of Audi domination, it was great to see an old racing marquee like Bentley win Le Mans and this review documents the race in fine fashion. Like last year's DVD, the 2003 version covers testing, scrutineering, qualifying, off-track news and the famous 24-hour race itself in solid detail, quenching any sportscar racing fanatic's thirst for Le Mans action. I would recommend this DVD to any sportscar fan."
2,had to customize clips,"I had to replace the grille clips on my 1990 Toyota pickup 4x4 the clips were not an exact match I had to shave down the guides on the side of the clip to make it fit in my grille then they were too hard to push in the radiator support so I had to cut off the interior springs of the clip to make it fit in the radiator support, when i got them in they were too short to completely grip all of the grille mounts on the grille, but after about an hour of customization on the clips I was finally able to make them work"
3,Not my thing,"I gave this three stars because for those with more gourmet tastes, this book would probably be a great addition to their cookbook library. I personally however didn't care for this book much at all. There's a few recipes I'll try and I made note of a few suggested cooking times from the dictionary section of the book, but I'm glad I checked this out from the library rather than spend money on it. I would have been greatly disappointed with the purchase."
3,you get what you pay for...,I would expect a kit with a soldering gun to have a small roll of solder with it; but not this one. Not bad for the price though.
3,Suggestions,This item is good but I think the kit should have an antistatic strap. This would incease safety for the user and the equipment.
4,Not Bad for the Price,"Good basic electronics toolkit, the soldering iron and flashlight both leave a lot to be desired, but other than that a good basic electronics toolkit to have around the home/office."
5,Review: Belkin 55-Piece Computer Tool Kit with Black Case,"We purchased this kit since it was free (after a rebate from Amazon) including the shipping charge as well. It will sit mostly on the desk in our repair lab while our more durable and smaller kit gets taken to daily service calls. By doing so, we do not have to worry about loosing the pieces since the case is not a hard shell."
2,Adequate usefulness and low value,"I purchased this set largely for the soldering iron, but also to give myself a good starter kit of tools. The soldering iron is of poor quality and was unable to provide adequate heat to the soldered elements on my board that I wanted to remove (the shaft of iron heated fine, but there was poor conduction to tip).Pro: nice little interchangeable tip set; pliersCons: soldering iron, stripper (no various gauge slots)Essentially, a non-substantial starter kit with a cost that is greater than the kit's value."
5,Recommended,"For anyone interested in knowing more about the Goddess and her ancient origins this booke is entirely recommended reading. If you already know about the Goddess and are a devoted follower of Her, this booke should be added to whatever collection of bookes you already have. It is informative and respective of the Goddess in all Her aspects. The worship of the Goddess is now becoming more and more open and this is a goode time to be opening ourselves to discovering Her roots. I recommend this booke highly to anyone interested in learning more of the Goddess and Her ways."
2,LEAKS,leaks after diving down more than 5 feet. Water pressure affects the goggles and they scratch pretty bad too. omg
4,Comfortable to wear,"This goggle is very comfortable to wear but it's anti fog effect went away after using a few times... Well, most goggles' anti fog don't last long anyway. I recommend this to those who are looking for fitting goggles."
2,where was the romance?,"Merce recently died at 92: may he rest in peace. This program was a bit choppy. Yes, they are showing material from decades of art. However, a good director could have come up with something smoother. This work implies that Cage and Cunningham were just artistic partners. It suggests they were platonic like Ben and Jerry. It says nothing about their rainbow flag membership. They were lovers, not just good co-workers. I just saw ""Carmen & Geoffrey,"" which granted was made decades later, but that work stated the couple was married, not just artists who got along well. Why couldn't this documentary go there? Majority people like Ossie Davis and Ruby Dee get acknowledged as a couple, why can't this happen for pink triangle pairs?!"
5,A Real Hero,"I've read almost every book I can find on Antarctic exploration and without a doubt, this is one of the finest. Tom Crean is always mentioned in books about early Antarctic epics but we've never really got to know him and what kind of a man he was. Michael Smith has done a fine job in tracing Crean's life from his early days in the Navy, his subsequent trips with Scott and Shackleton right up to his final days as a Pub owner is his home in Ireland. This is the kind of man you'd want whatever your expedition might be. He was brave, strong, honest, trustworthy and humorus, no matter what the circumstances. A great story about a real hero!"
4,great performance for the price!,this camera is an excellent choice for either your switch from a SLR or just as your first digital camera. Its easy to use and has excellent quality. The 6x optical zoom and digital view finder are great. the digital view finder allows additional battery life instead of using the battery hungry LCD screen. mpeg playbacks and sound bites are fantastic. other cameras with these specs cost so much more. this is a great buy. just make sure you pick up some rechargeable batteries and a larger memory card before you start having fun.
2,useless,This camera is totally useless in low light situations. Only good for outside. It also takes too long to take the picture after you press the button. I took it back and got an Olympus and it is 100% better
5,love this camera!,"I've been putting off buying digital. I liked my old trusty 35mm. In December I bought the FinePix 2800 from Amazon. It is great indoors and out, snow/water/pets/people - it takes great pictures. DO buy the rechargeable batteries and a back up set They last much longer than the regular batteries, and the power cord for downloading is a necessity. It was easy to learn how to operate it. There is a slight difference in taking a picture of a moving object but I got the knack of it after a few photos."
2,Only had it for one year and it's broken...,"I advise anyone to avoid purchasing this camera! I will say that it worked just fine for the first 8 months, and then I experienced a major flaw that seems to have happened several times to other owners ('zoom error'). The camera lens remains retracted and the camera will no longer function. I was able to somehow get it to work again (after periods of turning on and off, removing batteries and replacing them....etc...), but that was aggravating and I no longer had a reliable camera. It now does not work at all no matter what I try.After reading reviews from other disappointed owners, I am not even going to check into repairing it and I will never buy a fujifilm camera again."
3,Continuing writers block,"Despite having most of this already I paid out my money and what did I get? A reasonable overview with some obscurities, one of which ""Blue and Green"" is worth the cost on its own. While the music is all first class the compiling has created some jarring between tracks. I've always loved The Skiffle Sessions album but Lost John between Leaves Come Falling Down and Tupelo Honey sounds bizarre. Nearly all the tracks he has re-recorded are done better in their original incarnation and one gets the feeling that with this, the movie ""best of"" and the country abomination Pay The Devil before them that he has nothing to say at present. I love Morrison's music and sincerely hope there is more of it to come, its now been a fair number of years since there has been an album of original material and he is overdue for his muse to return."
3,Good Product But........,"I am impressed with the design of the Daggertail, but there is room for improvement. First off, I would prefer it to be sharp. As a person who practices several different edge weapon fighting arts I was really looking forward to being able to add this one to my collection. I'm not sure the steel will stand up to sharpening, but I'll give it a shot. They also could have made the bolsters a little more sturdy. I'm sure it will last for a while, but I plan on modifying the bolsters and screws to insure that part of this thing doesn't go flying when I try to use it. Bottom line, if you are a collector looking for something to put on your wall and nothing more that I would give this 5 stars and say buy it for sure. But if you are a practicer of one of some form of edge weapon art then I would say try to find one elsewhere first, but if you cannot this will work fine......with some modifications."
4,Great Bag,"This is a great bag. I have had it for several years now. Has not worn out, ripped, or anything. Its a little bulky but thats what protects the computer."
3,Great for Men...,"Great Product for a great value. I purchased it for $25 after mail in rebate. However, it is too big for me. Very well constructaed and durable. I have used it on about 5 business trips so far, and I am not going to take it any more. It is too heavy for me to lug on a plane with my carryon luggage. I think that I am going to switch to a backpack. But I think it will be better for men to carry."
5,Good compendium of historic European battles,"Often I wish to relax and read for only ten or fifteen minutes. This is the perfect book for that. Each snapshot of famous battles takes up only a few pages. For the major battles a map is provided. Maps are B&W, nothing fancy but good solid maps with units, roads, rivers, towns, and a description of terrain. The perfect companion for the armchair general--he/she can pursue fun reading when a long book is just too much. There are some 250-300 battles treated here, some only a brief paragraph long. I only wish the concept were extended to other continents such as India and Africa. This book is well worth the expense for such a compact and useful compendium. I recommend it highly but agree with the other reviewer that a detailed battlefield guide for the traveler is necessary if a trip is being planned."
2,dead frame,"Length:: 0:51 MinsFrame died in less than a year. manual was not helpful, ever. I never figured out the exact resolution to size/crop my picts to fit the frame exactly. (and it wasn't in the manual) You've got to have a thumb drive or compact flash card to load your picts on but i didn't see that as a problem."
3,astar photo frame,"Received promptly. Good quality but does not have internal memory. My mistake, but its not what I wanted. Not clear in product details on this point."
3,"Same Old, Same Old","I was excited to read the Country Living Cottage Style book thinking the cute, cottage cover would reflect the content of the book. Silly me! As the old adage goes ""never judge a book by its cover."" I have picked up the book numerous times to read and peruse and just not felt inspired or enlightened by the material covered and the photos. It just would've been fun to see some more contemporary interpretations of the cottage style. Next time I look for a cottage design book I'll review the pages on-line first and pay more attention tocustomer reviews."
3,Written by people who've never been married,"Seriously, if you put a married couple in a small spaceship together for 9 months you end up with a murder-suicide at the very least. What is wrong with Connie Nielsen's character? This chick is amped up on Ecstasy for almost the entire movie - we choose these idiots (and lets face it they all are) for a critical mission to Mars and she's swooning and dancing all over the place, and I swear orgasming a few times. Cool ending but really, really sentimental for the most part - spoils a great concept. Why I could never go on that mission? Because I would no doubt vomit if I had to watch Tim Robbins and Connie Nielsen swooning over each other - and vomiting in zero G is not generally recommended."
3,ok,worked well but the neck strap kept coming off had to tape it to get it to stay but other than that it is a great product
2,Be ready to sleep.......really sleep,"Okay, if you aren't trying to get anything from this experience. A snooze. Seriously."
2,Bully and battered women,The first half of this book is excellent and gives some very usefull advice. It is geared toward professional situations.The second half of the book is a self help manual for battered women. It spends a lot of time telling verbally and physically abused women how to escape from these circumstances.
5,A beguiling journey set in California,"I loved this book. As a reader I loved the flow of the story and the many precise, surprising details. Vivid images like the descriptions of the little girl Mona spinning in a circle, and Franny's wonderful collection of shoes kept me reading. But as a therapist I loved how this book captured the messy, uneven, disturbing experiences of life. The children's experience of loss when their mother Jane takes off echoes the narrator Mattie's experience of loss when her neglectful parents leave Mattie to fend for herself as a kid. There are lots of details that resonate like this. Also the book is set in California--one of my favorite places. I highly recommend."
1,Not many reviews,Seems not too many people read this book. Well they did themselves a favor. This book was filled with shallow characters and while seeming to promise an intriguing plot turned out to be a bore. I forced myself to finish it; don't ask me why.
2,Instructions are misleading,"The instructions for this suggest one can simply slide the seat onto the rack. That's not the case, however. After a maddening hour or so, I used a flat-head screw driver to leverage the seat on the front of the rack. Looks like a design or manufacturing flaw prevents one from sliding it on. I haven't used it yet, but I came within minutes of packing it back up and returning it. Let's hope its flaws do not extend to how safe it is."
1,Nearly broken fingers. Twice!!!,This seat may be safe for kids but it is not safe for adults.Trying to remove the seat from the rack nearly put my wife and I in the hospital.First her fingers got jammed between the rack and seat as I was pulling. Many tears and fearful of a broken finger.After re reading the instructions (there is a caution) and using as much precaution as humanly posable my finger got stuck as well.This is a dangerous design flaw that leaves me wondering how a product like this clears safety codes.It really takes 2 people to remove the seat plus some sort of tool that they don't provide to keep your fingers from getting mauled.Another problem is that you have to wrestle with this bit of velcro to remove the foot harnesses. It's very frustrating. I have to walk around the bike looking for enough room to pull the straps apart.From design to materials all the way to the flimsy manual this bike seat just feels cheap. And it's not $$ THAT $$ cheap!!Good luck!
4,Insightful!,"Allen J. Scott's short, scholarly book makes a compelling case for the future growth of regional economies and explains the key role they are likely to play in shaping future global political and economic development. Though written in dense, academic language, the book makes its points clearly and supports them with research, theory and statistics. Scott's guidelines for `regional directorates' reflect many experiments that are already under way around the world, and seeks to capture the best features of each. If his basic idea is correct, then a conscious effort to build regional institutions should speed economic development and reduce world economic stresses. This book is heavy reading, but it is concise and to the point. We [...] recommend it to executives in multinational corporations, entrepreneurs thinking about where to locate, urban planners, civic leaders and government officials - in short, anyone who wants to promote or profit from regional economic development."
2,Horrible Gothic of the early 80's,"This album isn't that bad. It has a few goods meaningful songs like Heart Land, Alice, 1969, and Phantom. Floodland is probably the best you can get with Gothic music. This album serves as a stepping stone to one of the greastest gothic bands ever. Stick with floodland. And even try out the Mission UK. For ambient check out Controlled Bleeding. I hope this review is helpful."
3,not very sturdy,"Bought this item for my sons birthday, had it up 2 days and the lever that raises it up and down broke. every time he would shoot it would fall straight down. Called the company and they were really nice and replaced the piece. So if you play alot of basketball be weary of this goal not really very sturdy."
5,Good Value,"The installation instructions were vague and the parts and hardware were not labeled and the illustrations were not very good, so the installation took a while. The finished product does work pretty well though. A good product for the money. I would purchase this again."
2,Overwrought,"Bernadette Peters is a fantastic interpretor of Sondheim - just listen to her in Into The Woods, Sunday In THe Park with George, Sondheim - a Celebration, or the concert version of Anyone Can Whistle.However, I found her performances on this recording to be overwrought and more about the Star Persona of Ms Peters than the songs themselves.Sorry, too dahling for me"
4,Very good!,"This is such an incredible bargain price and a great resource for the layperson. So why only 4 stars? Well, I'm a strong advocate of yoga and this author says to avoid certain postures. I understand his rationale but do not fully agree as I think the ability to perform each posture depends upon the individual's physical condition and judgment. Yoga has so many modifications/variations that it can be easily adapted. Otherwise this book goes into easily understood explanations for just about any muscular/skeletal condition and other important areas such as proper breathing techniques (believe it or not MOST folks do not breathe properly). I doubt anyone other than a physical therapist or physician would be disappointed in this fine, easy to read book."
4,"this phone is not the best, but the price is damn nice","i have had many 2.4 gig cell phones..panasonic, ge, sony...i needed a replacement for my 2 year old 249$ panasonic..and the 49.99 price was awesome with answering machine and caller id...the range is not as good as the 249$ panasonic..but it is fine for my apartment...a good starter phone..if i was rich i would get the panasoinic...but a good phone 3.5 stars...for price and features"
1,GE phone,"We bought this phone when we moved and it worked fine for about a month then the battery life went short. I could talk for about 20 minutes before the battery would start to die. (After charging over night). Now the reception is poor, you can usually not hear well on it at all. I would not recommend this to anyone. Not worth the money when you have to replace it 30 days later."
4,Great phone for the price,"This has been (after one month) a great phone ... It's clear, has good range, and the memory and caller id are easy to use. My only gripe is that there's no way to tell if your line is active by looking at the phone. This is important to me since I have to use a dial-up internet connection. Other than that, I highly recommend it."
1,Not Worth It,"I bought this phone to replace one that I had and ended up returning it after one call. The reception was worse than my 900mhz phone and it sounded like I was talking and listening from inside a cave. For such a good brand name, I was very dissapointed with the quality of this phone and would not recommend it to anyone."
1,The phone you cannot answer,"When I first bought this phone I really liked it. A few months later, the phone would not always lock in a channel and when it didn't, I could not answer the phone. I would hit the talk button, and the phone would just beep at me. Now when I dial, the #7 does not always work. It is very annoying, and this is my only phone and I cannot call someone with a 7 in their number."
5,"The Best Footballer in The World ""Ronaldo""",Ronaldo El Fenomeno in his prime is amazing to see. you could learn so me good moves from this DVD.
2,"This is vitamin D1, it is not D3 which is the better of the two.","Nature's Plus, in my opinion, is one of the very best supplements companies in the market, I trust their products and consume them daily....but not this particular one. Unfortunately, this vitamin D product is vitamin D1, which everyone knows is not as good as vitamin D3. The great majority of vitamin D3 products in the market are made from fish, thus, if you are allergic to fish you can take this one, I suppose. Do your own research on this matter, I'm just expressing my opinion, I'm not a doctor, pharmacist, nutritionist, nor am I an expert in the fields of health or nutrition. If you have any doubts or questions about this product, go to the Nature's Plus website an ask for information from the manufacturer, I suppose they have an email address or a phone number for consumers to use."
3,A Solid Read,This is the forth installment of The Lost Era books and in it we meet the somewhat disfunctional crew of Enterprise-C. This book has a much darker tone than the first three books and is the least favorite for me. It spends a great deal of time exploring the problems of the various crew members before turning into a very good mystery story. For those readers who like reading about characters who have a mulitude of problems then this is the book for you. The back cover description gives one the impression that this story is mostly about an archeological find concerning Cardassians and that really isnt the case. A large portion of the book concerns the Enterprises XO named Halak. Garrett's husband and son are also featured. Though this book wasnt my cup of tea it was as finely crafted as the first three and I am sure there are those who will like it as much as they did the first three.
2,Not worth for good photography,"If you are serious about photography, this tripod will be a real waste. This may be good for video shooting, but for serious photography spend some more money and buy a good one. You will never regret this advice."
4,Quite good!,Actually I didn't expect too much for such a cheap tripod. But it is beyond my expectations! I highly recommend it!
4,"Small price, Big Tripod","I read over 75% of the reviews before I bought this and I was NOTdisappointed! It has better feet than ones I looked at for 6 timesthe price, an excellent 1st Tripod for us novice photo bugs."
4,Broke in 3 months! 4 stars shows my earlier review.,This is my first tripod and I used it for a Canon Powershot A540. A very small and light camera and looks really tiny sitting on a tripod. I had written a good review for this product a couple of weeks back but then one of the extendable legs broke one fine day with less than 3 months of use. We didnt even drop it. Couldnt put it back on. The 4 stars shows my earlier rating.
3,Next time I'll Spend more.,"This is on of those cases where you get what you pay for. First, the tripod was missing a screw that holds one of the legs on, pretty easy to fond a replacement and fix it but annoying that I have to. Secondly, it's not a horrible product considering the price, but it does make me wish I had spent more to get a nicer one. My two main complaints are that the level on the leg is far from accurate and overall its fairly flimsy. The flimsy part bothers me the most because I feel like it is not going to provide a steady shot like a tripod should."
1,Dont get this tri pod,This is a very poor tri-pod. If you are gona use this often and want a quality tri-pod do not get this one. It is weak and wobbly and hard to use. After about a month one of the legs fell off. Please do not make the same mistake i did when purchasing a tri pod.
3,Digital Concepts Tripod,"The tripod I ordered was not the one I received. I returned it and was sent a second tripod, but again, it was not the item I had ordered. I already had a TR 60N and the one sent to me the second time was much shorter and not as strong as the one I had. I decided not to return the second tripod as the inconvenience and time and cost was not worth it."
2,Use at your own risk,"This tripod is a piece of crap. I was afraid to leave my camera on it for fear it would fall and break. One of the legs broke the second time I used it, and the handle crank for adjusting it snapped off after about 6 months. Save your money and get a tripod that you don't have to worry about using."
3,3 1/2 STAR,"tripod looks professional, handy and comes with a carrying bag. Not the durable, but it's a good tripod."
3,Great for Starters,The tripod does its job and holds my camera still but materials seem to be a little chintzy. Slightly flimsy and makes me a little nervous using this with a brand new camera...but its does the job.Its great to start out with and the price is excellent for its quality.
1,Total Junk...,"This broke inside of 10min. of usage 1 screw stripped out, causing the camera mount to basically fall apart... Forget about the return policy, costs to much to deal w/ sending it back. Save yourself the hastle and avoid this plastic piece of junk. If you need to waste $20.00 roll down your window and let it fly..."
4,Excellent product for the price,"The product is excellent. This is my first tripod, and I am completely satisfied... an instruction manual would have saved me about 10-20 minutes (considering that I have had no experience with tripods), but other than that I have nothing but praise for this product."
5,"cheapy, awesome tripod","The price is cheap, it kinda feels cheap, but it works great. It's pretty much aluminum and plastic, very light, has a handle on the side that can be useful, comes with a handy carrying bag, and has a hook underneath in case you need to add some weight to it. I use it for my dslr until I can buy a really nice one, and it does it's job just fine. The picture shows a metal and plastic handle, but the handle is all plastic so you know. If you're looking for a cheap one, this'd be the cheap one to get."
2,Fell apart after 2 years,"Some people may be looking for a light-weight tripod (like this one) to go with your small digital camera.While this makes sense, one should not expect a light weight tripod to last long.I used mine with a camcorder for recording kids' recitals, concerts and sports events.It was easy to use and quick to set up.But it is a little top heavy when a camcorder is mounted.One time I set it up on a long table in a crowd fully extended in order to make a shot from above the crowd.Some kids leaned on the table and there fell my camcorder.Fortunately, I grabbed it before it hit anyone or the ground.And then the middle extension rod fell off in 6 months.But it was still usable notwithstanding the instability when extending the neck.1 year later, a log was lost from the pivot joint.That's the end.I sm shopping for a new one.This time, I am looking for a heavy-duty one.If you are spending $500 or more on camcorder and digi-cam, it makes no sense to put them on a flimsy $30 tripod."
