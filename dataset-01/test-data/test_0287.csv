2,Replacement Blades for Fat Max Tapes,"I really liked the Fat Max 30' tape. However, Stanley does not make replacement blades for it. My Fat Max is a little less than a year old and has developed a hole at about the 11 foot point. Because no replacement blades are available, the cost for replacing it with a new one is too high. Too bad Stanley doesn't stand behind the fat max with replacement blades like they do with some of their other less sturdy tapes."
2,Disappointed,"After reading other reviews, it appears that I may have received a lemon. As mentioned in one review, the return velocity is very fast -- and it did lead to kink and tear. My primary complaint relates to excessive play in the lip (well beyond the lip's thickness), which has led to inaccurate cuts."
1,Absolutely awful - typos on every page,"While the content of this book is just okay - more of a kumbaya ""you can do it"" kind of thing, I am frustrated that someone can get away with selling a book for $20 that literally has typos on every page. I feel totally ripped off, like I was scammed by someone who didn't even bother to read his book once through to check for errors."
2,I guess you get what you pay for...,"Pros: It's cheap and it seems to have good suctionCons: The power cord comes out of the cleaner at the bottom near the floor and is hard to keep from running over- extremely inconvenient. The ""power brush tool"" stops spinning as soon as it has a little contact with the fabric on my couch or throw pillows- NOT good for removing pet hair. It's VERY loud.Overall I wish I had read reviews before I purchased this dirt devil. Next time I will invest a little more money and getter a better quality cleaner."
3,Good 1930s westerns,"As movies go, these early oaters of the Duke's were not artistically good. The plots were simplistic, pure good (John Wayne) vs. evil, and good always won. They were shot in the southern California desert, and the sets were just a bit flimsy. The characters were easy to follow--no contradictions. In short, these just aren't very good. If it were not for the fact that Wayne eventually made some good westerns, I doubt that these would have resurfaced or that anyone would have bought them. Still, they have some interest, if only as curiosities, as examples of what boys liked to see in the Great Depression."
3,descriptive but falls short,"The premise reminded me of Gail Godwin's ""A Mother and Two Daughters,"" with two middle-aged sisters reevaluating their life after the death of their father. Unlike that book, however, ""The Wilder Sisters"" lacks subtlety and depth when it comes to its characters. While appealing, their differences are exaggerated to their point where they almost (but not quite) become stereotypes. While I certainly couldn't begrudge them their ultimate happiness, I couldn't help but wish it revolved a little less around men. This isn't an insult, but I would be very interested in seeing this turned into a Lifetime Channel movie. It seems tailor made for a two-hour TV movie, the kind you can curl up and watch on a rainy weekend with a friend."
5,John Williams is great!,"John Williams has done a supurb job (with William Ross) for the music for this movie. There is a lot of music that's similar to the first movie, but that is to be expected. The theme ""Fawkes the Phoenix"" is beautiful and fits perfectly. This music should please anyone! John Williams has done it again!"
2,Could Be Better,I didn't think that this was all this great. The songs sound the same after a while. The sound too similar to the first and there movie.I do like it though. The music is nice and creative. But only to a point.I would personally just stick with the first sound track.
3,Cute but hard for little one to get bugs in and out,"My son got this for christmas this past year. He loves to play with the bugs, and they are very adorable. Each bug makes a different noise as the child plays with it....one has a rattle inside, another has a squeeker, and one has a crackley sounding plastic inside. But, it really isnt a spilling toy. The mouth of the ""jar"" is too small and the bugs have to be crammed down into it, and definately won't spill out when it is turned upside down."
2,"Um, not what I expected","I thought this toy would be something my 6 month old could play with, but the toys r so much bigger than the opening of the container that it would take a strong person to get them in or out. Even my 3 year old couldnt get them out, and asked for my help. hmm. I usually love melissa and doug toys, but this one I just don't get. i even looked online to see if there was something i was missing but no."
3,Smaller then what i expected for the price.,My Grandson enjoyed this bug jug - but i feel that it was smaller then expected for the price. Because the jug space is small he really had to pull to get the bugs outs.
3,an English teacher's nightmare,"I have long been a fan of Irish storylines so I was prepared to enjoy this book. What I was not prepared for, and what made it a chore to read, were the glaring grammatical errors. One or two grammer glitches can be overlooked, but this book has more than it's fair share. First you sloghed through confusing, rambling, wordy, run-on sentences that required two or three readings. Then you were left scratching your head over sentences that had key words missing ,used incorrect words (i.e. past rather than passed),or seemed disjointed and out of context.On the plus side,the author used some lovely descriptive terms. If you can ignore the errors, you may enjoy the plot."
3,Good tool for skill improvements,I utilized this work book to help my child strengthen language arts skills. The work book is easy to follow and the 5-day format was particularly helpful for a daily practice session. The questions were straight forward and did not require hours to complete. This was a definite plus when your child comes in from hours at school and really doesn't want EXTRA homework.
5,A Portrait of the Underbelly of Macau and a Former Closed City in the USSR Wrapped Around Human Trafficking!,"This is the first in a series of (4 currently) Ray Sharp Novels by Eric Stone. The Author weaves fact and I surmise personal experiences, in a riveting tale that takes you through Macau in the mid-90's, as well as, the formerly closed Russian City of Vladivostok. As an avid reader and collection fiction set in Asian locales, I had not to date read anything that provides such vivid color on the underbelly of Macau and more specifically the topics of sex for sale and human trafficking for sexual exploitation. Personally, a winning formula in any form of media blends both excitement and repulsion. The ""Living Room of the Dead"" offers both of the aforementioned in ample quantities. My only regret is that it took me so long to find the series and I look forward to reading the rest."
4,De Camp looks at magic,"If, like me, you're a pretty thoroughgoing skeptic about magic, spirits and all of that, this is the book for you. In it, the De Camps give a quick overview of magic, alchemy, and ghosts, along with related subjects. The word-portraits of such luminaries as Madame Blavatsky, Aleister Crowley and Mary Baker Eddy, conjoned with extracts from their writings, are alone worth the price of the book.De Camp's name on a book ensures lively, well-written prose, backed up with solid research. About the only quibble I have is that there are a few minor errors in the account of the Salem witch trials."
4,A beautiful worship album from MWS.,"""Worship Again,"" the follow-up to Michael W. Smith's ""Worship,"" is nearly as good as its predecessor, but it is a very good album in its own right. Some of my favorites here include ""Step By Step/Forever We Will Sing,"" ""The Wonderful Cross,"" ""There Is None Like You"" and the powerful Rich Mullins classic ""I See You."" I also love the studio cuts--especially Smitty's version of Tim Hughes' ""Here I Am To Worship."" And then there's ""There She Stands,"" a song about Old Glory which Smitty wrote following the September 11, 2001 attacks. ""Worship Again"" is ALMOST as good as ""Worship,"" but it is still definitely worth a listen or ten or twenty."
2,"SLOWEST shipping, NO communication, OK product.","Two weeks after purchase, no product or any email received even though Amazon said ship in 1-2 business day, and no reply to email query. Then I complained to Amazon and waited another week to get the product.The product is ok for use on body front where I can reach. Though most useful treatment should be on the back where I could not reach and the sucking device does not provide a soft tube to make it possible unless get help from second person.By the way, I tried to buy this product from same seller on Ebay and was over-bidded by some bidders, but then I was told they don't want to buy and I can buy it with the MAXIMUM price I set. It feels like manipulation. Either seller or Ebay was not reasonable."
2,Incomplete and not accurate description,"These cups are plastic. The description at the time I bought them failed to mention that, and it's important. Also, they arrived missing the suction/handle piece, so were useless right out of the box. I'm going to go with glass ones from massagecupping-nw.com"
4,UNO DE LOS MEJORES DISCOS DE REY RUIZ!,"""POR QUE ES AMOR"" ES UNO DE LOS MEJORES TRABAJOS DISCOGRAFICOS DE REY RUIZ. TAMBIEN ES LA ULTIMA PRODUCCION DE REY RUIZ PARA LA MULTINACIONAL SONY DISCOS. LOS MEJORES TEMAS DEL DISCO SON ""MI ANGEL"", ""ERES TU"", ""POR QUE ES AMOR"" Y ""VEN A MI"". EL DISCO ESTA MUY BUENO Y LOS ARREGLOS SON EXCELENTES. TAMBIEN RECOMIENDO ""SUBEME EL VOLUMEN"" DE MICHAEL STUART, ""PASIONAL"" DE JESSICA CRISTINA Y ""SOLA"" DE INDIA."
1,Lousy.,"Devonsquare's CD album BYE BYE ROUTE 66 was GREAT. But they apparently lost their feel for rocking it, and got bogged down when they tried going a new ""route."""
1,"""The Prince Of Fu##ing Darkness""...","...as the man he himself puts it on one of ""The Osbournes""-episodes, and what a show! Pathetic! I feel sorry for the fans, I find it impossible to take this ""wreck"" of a rocker serious -not one thing about the ""Osbourne""-reality is about music, and here the other day I saw him reuniting with Black Sabbath for Live Aid. He was a ""wreck"" already then, and he sucked on stage -and this was in 85, people! First I though it was Kelly up there! And now a friend of mine tells me that Ozzy is apologizing to the fans the whole ""reality""-thing? Too late! It looked as if his days were counted already in 85! A shame!"
2,Oy vey what a piece of dooky.,"I love Ozzy and Sabbath and all that associated happy horsecrap, but this is one sorry excuse for a mother-truckin' boxset! Where's ""You Said It All""? SHARON!!! Come on, I know they stole 1 million bucks in diamonds but do you have to make up for it by ripping off us fans? Man oh man am I perturbed. I buy every Ozzy single at premium prices and this is what I get- some half-baked box set with all the crappiest B-sides known to man. Where's my justice? You ham & eggers better come up with a brilliant new solo album or I'm just gonna take all my Ozzy and Sabbath discs out to a field and take a dump on 'em all. 'Nuff said! Geez, get the new Firewind or Rob Rock CD. Ozzy has been Yoko Oh No-ed. I'm Rick James, be-otch. Peace out!"
3,Not as brilliant as expected,"Ozzy Osbourne is doing a Van Halen and releasing many of his best tracks in multiple-compilations in order just to sucker fans to part with more cash, so its the same stuff but just differently packaged. I can only recommend buying this if you hold none of his records."
1,Disappointing,"The zipper broke the first day I wore them. Come on. I expect some durability out of any garment, especially something called ""paratrooper pants"". No return business. Less than one star."
5,My favorite pants ever!,"I put all kinds of stuff in these pockets. Two pair of shoes, iPhone, bourbon flask, wallet, glasses, sinkers, knife, etc. Great quality and they look real macho and sexy. I love them and wish I could wear them to work. Maybe I should change careers..."
4,Good Pants,"Bought these pants for my 13 year old son, to wear out in the woods for airsoft and general hiking around. He is 5'5"" and 95lbs. and the small fit fine. Able to cinch the waist down to his 28"" size and use the ties at the bottom of legs to adjust length to his 31"" inseam. They look great now and will still give him room to keep using as he grows. Material is thick but not overly rigid or coarse like some BDU type pants can be. Worth the money."
1,Not really satisfied with the pants,I was somewhat disappointed in the pants but I had them altered but still haven't worn them. I would not purchase another pair.
4,Very Comfortable . . .,I had noticed in previous reviews mention of these pants that they run small. I'm glad that I took their advice because they do indeed run small. They fit well. the material is soft and comfortable. They are long. nothing that needle and thread cant remedy. I will purchase a few more pair indeed..
3,Too small! I'm a big guy!,"I read one review where someone said these 'run big.' Be careful believing that. They run big on SMALL people! Lol. If you're a smaller person, they'll look WONDERFUL on you. But me, I'm 6'4"", 250 lbs! NO. FREAKING. WAY."
3,Product Concerns,"I purchased three pair of these pants. I like the fit and feel. No problem there. However I have some concerns about possible quality issues. Time will time. The zipper in particular does not move up and down its track easily. This issue seems to appear to varying degrees on all three pair. The fact that these are made in China is also annoying - though THAT issue is hard to get away from these days. And I could put up with the China issue better if the zipper flowed smoothly up and down its track. I just hope that they hold up for a reasonable amount of time. Oh, I wear these in an office setting or about town so if they don't hold up it isn't because of hard wear on my part. (We can't make things in America anymore???) I like the style and fit - again, time will tell..."
3,"Well, they came quickly","They're great pants, retro and comfy. Except, I guess XL means waist is ""39 IN. to 43 IN"" which amazon description does not say, of course.I wanted to give it a shot because they look nice and not pricey, I don't know if they screwed it up or just order yourself medium or large even though your thinking you want roomy pants. Otherwise great material and shape."
2,Fatigues are for utility use and not fashion,The Stone Vintage Paratrooper fatigues are great in photos but if you are nota first responder or use these pants for utility purposes this will not be afunctional pair of pants. I have owned the columbia brand and the fit istotally different. I rarely even think about returning any clothes but I hadto actually return these pants. The XL is actually a 42. You would require alarge in this style and color to fit a 38-40 and not look like a clown.I just realize that the only items I can't purchase online are clothes.6' 185lbs. Can shop off the rack without alterations. 38-40 in pants.And I don't wear tight fitting clothes or baggy clothes falling off mybackside. Hope this assists in your search for a comfortable pair ofpants that you can wear and not have to be a first responder of relivingbeing in the military.
1,Too small,"I am typically a size 4 in everything. I ordered a small in these pants based on reviews indicating the pants run very large. This was not the case for me. A small was entirely too tight. Based on the pants I got, I would need a large to fit. I am pretty sure a medium would still be too tight. It's unfortunate as I was very excited about these pants."
1,false advertisement,Do not buy this cap i if you want a corduroy cap. It is a plain black cloth cap. If advertised as such I would rate it OK
1,I did not see this movie,"When I ordered this movie, I got a message that there was an error in procession the order. I looked and did not see the purchase in my account. So I went on to other things in my life. More than 24 hours have passed before I noticed that it had in deed been purchased. BUT NOW I DON'T HAVE THE TIME TO WATCH IT! PLEASE, AMAZON, REFUND MY MONEY FOR THIS MOVIE!"
4,Just what I wanted.,"This book of Latin crossword puzzles is just what I was looking for to supplement my two teenage daughters' Latin course. I am a homeschooling mother with no Latin experience and wanted to give them a little extra to study but did not want another text book for fear of a revolt. It is an enjoyable, relaxing way to review and increase your vocabulary in Classical Latin. The words that will be used are listed at the bottom of the page which is a big help, but I would suggest a Latin/English dictionary in the house if you get into a jam. If you are a ""brain"" in Latin you probably won't find it very satisfying, but this book works well for beginners."
3,Okay Set for Household Chores,"This toolkit has both enormous plusses and significant minuses:Plus:Assortment of toolsQuantity of toolsBoth metric and English sizesCarrying casePriceMinus:Quality of tools (Good enough for simple around the house chores, but not do-it-yourself projects. The metal is not as strong as a higher quality set from other manufacturers. Although it hasn't happened yet, I expect metal stress fractures soon on the wrenches)Tire Gauge (not really useful in a set of this type, useful in your glovebox)Overall, an okay set for around the house chores. If you engage in do-it-yourself projects on any regular schedule, invest in a higher quality set."
4,"Great tools, Great price","As a woman, I don't use tools too often and when i do, I don't really know what it is I'm using. that's why I found these tools very useful and easy to handle. It has 159 pieces and I can easily use any of them to assemble bookcases, install light fixures and fix small odd things around my house. I have enev used them to put a bike together for my niece. The sturdy case securly holds all the wrenches, pliers and driver sets. The pliers all have rubber grips, which I found to come in handy, especially with my slipepry fingers. I have used these tools more than I ever thought I would and the price is very reasonable."
3,SPEAK UP,"This music is tight, a change from the common ballad queen. Her voice is entirely too low and she just seems to slur her words, which is a down for this much waited cd. The rappers in on some of the songs dont help the songs at all. If you could actually hear what she's saying and her tones were much stronger, the songs would be much better. Overall a much needed change for the Braxton.My favorite songs:ON THE WAY OUT (FIRST SONG ON CD?)LIES, LIES LIES,SELFISHHIT THE FREEWAYFALL IN LOVEIts good, i love the rock in lies, lies, lies! I am feeling that totally. Glad she worked with the Neptunes, my fav producers besides timbaland! Good she branched out."
3,Average Effort....,"Possessing one of the best and sultry alto voices, Toni Braxton is back with a new album. There are just no real standout tracks like BREATHE AGAIN, UNBREAK MY HEART, etc....this cd is very safe and does not break any new ground. It is just simple R&B Fair. I hope next time she goes back to the ballads and uptempo jams that made her a household name instead of leaning towards hip-hop which to me is overdone these days anyways.Better luck next time!"
3,Lies! Lies! Lies,"This is the one track that stood out for me on this album (written by Stockley of Mint Condition), the live drums, guitars and percussions on this one sent my heart racing. For anyone's information, Toni's talent overcomes even the worst ill-produced song. On this album, Toni showcases her versatility on the album she delivers everything from R&B to Hip-Hop. Compliment is given where its due and I take my hat off for this album. We now know that Toni is instoppable.= Tebza (Cape Town, South Africa)"
3,"Good, but not that good...","I actually like this CD. It's not as good as Toni's previous works, which is why I gave it a low star-count. It's like, most of Toni's albums before displayed how she can really sing. The only song that is really worth listening to over and over again is the Neptune's-pumped ""Hit the Freeway""...otherwise, the album isn't one that you can spin on a regular basis."
3,The Absolute Best Female voice out there!,Her first album was a classic but the material for this album is not the greatest. She can make an average song sound wonderful but the combination of the songs on this album is uneven and not right for her. Hopefully she'll run into a decent songwriter like myself who can put her on top where her talent belongs.
1,More Than A Flop!,"This has got to be one of the worst albums of the year. Toni Braxton's debut self titled CD is still her best piece of work. ""More Than A Woman"" is horrible. My rating is an ""F"" overall. Do not, I repeat, do not purchase this garbarge, you will be solely disappointed. I like Toni, but sorry, this just doesn't cut it! Where is Jam & Lewis, Babyface, David Foster, Narada, Michael J. Powell, etc. when you need them. Someone please tell Toni she's 30 something, not a teenager!"
5,Hugely underrated,I think the release of this album is just another case of bad timing. With everyone rushing to release albums in time for the holiday season shopping this gem of an album has been drowned in the fray. I was surprised by how good this album was when I first listened to it. Many people had told me it was bad and some of the less music savvy pundits on this board have given it bad reviews. Don't listen to the bull ...buy the album.
5,This Album Rocks!,First of all Toni is more than a woman She has put up with alot of things in the past few years or so ive heard! but all the music on this CD is worth taking time to listen to!
3,More Than a Woman,"First let me say I am a Big Toni Braxton fan so when I heard this CD I could not believe it, she always brings it to the front. However this is not her best the only two cuts I enjoyed were ""Lies,Lies,Lies"" and ""Selfish"" the others I could not get into,the lyrics did not make much since, Her last CD ""The Heat"" was wonderful, and her version of Me and My Boyfriend, what is that?"
1,"""Secrets is the last.......Where is Babybace?""","This cd is Uproarious ! A perfect example of an artist that depended on another artist. Babyface and Toni were a perfect match for one another. I don't know why they will not get back together and do another great classic cd. This is O.K but I would have done it abit differently. Tracks 1-12 would have been te first to go. And I would have just put some tracks on there from her first two albums and called it a day! And the name of the cd would have been the second to go. What happeed to great songs like ""Find me a Man?""and ""Let it flow?"" and ""There's no me without you?"" Mann Babyface and Daryl Simmon's please comeback and help this woman!"
1,Ugh,Ugh. What can I say. The first time I bought this product I had to return it because no water came out of the hot water faucet at all. The second one I got worked fine for 4 months or so then developed a leak at the base of the cooler. I will never buy a product from Addico again.
2,"Grinds very coarsely, kind of flimsy","I had one of these for about six months until the movable squeeze-lever snapped off at the base. I got the pepper ball because I thought it'd be easier to use than a mill (since it's one-handed) and Ming Tsai uses something similar. Sadly, this is a rather cheaply-made device. It actually takes quite a bit more effort to grind with this thing than with a conventional peppermill. And the fragments it produces are very coarse -- even at the finest setting. If you only occasionally do dishes that call for cracked peppercorns, this might be an okay device. But if you're looking for a peppermill alternative to use regularly, keep looking."
4,"cute grinder, but be prepared to squeeze","This is a cute grinder that has a magnetic strip in the back so I can put it against the fridge and not take counter space. Design is cool. However, the inside is small so it doesn't hold many peppers, and refill is a bit of a hassle. Also, it only grinds a bit at a time so it takes a lot of squeezing for heavier spicing. I found it better suited for spices I only used occasionally and only a tiny bit at a time - say sichuan peppercorn. I'm going back to regular grinder for black pepper though."
1,Broke in a few months,"I'm still looking for a GOOD one-handed pepper mill. This one has a very low volume per grind, so I had to work hard with it. It also broke after less than six months, which means I'm looking again!"
2,I've dropped them in the pot TWICE.,"Sure...could be OPERATOR ERROR. I accept that. But twice now, I've dropped the blasted salt grinder in the pot or pan I was cooking in. It was a gift, but I'd imagine this thing will go to Goodwill soon."
5,2 Years and still going strong...,"I've read both good and bad reviews and I have to say I'm definitely happy with the Dynamo Pro. I use it mainly for astrophotography, camping and yes I've actually had to jump start a few vehicles with it. I've powered both a telescope mount and dew heater controller simultaneously for several nights with no issues. The spotlight is very useful for camping or anytime you need a lot of light (800,000 candlepower version). Do know that Orion includes a disclaimer sheet within the box which states you need to charge it at least every 30 days or so. It also helps to store the unit in a regulated climate although I'm guilty of leaving it in the car for weeks before bringing it in the house. I gotta say after owning this product for 2+ years I've had no issues. I believe the actual battery is a deep cycle lead acid (sealed) unit and as with all deep cycle batteries, they must be maintained (charged) on a fairly regular basis."
3,Worth reading them,"As a good Russian, Andreiev's writing is about strange characters, sad and depressing situations, and mad fantasies of doom and despair. So, why would you read them? Because the man is a very good writer, espcially good at conveying dark moods and states of mind. The story I like the best is ""Dies Irae"", a wonderful tale of Judgement Day to come. He also wrote a novel, ""Sachka Yegulev"" which is about a strange revolutionary fighting against the Czar. Andreiev accurately portraits the depressing state of mind of pre-Revolutionary Russia, which led to Bolshevism. Reading him, is to enter a world of despair and dreams of revenge. Not for the light-hearted."
5,Great info,"If you are planning a trip to the carribeans (Grenadines/Windward Islands) - this is your #1 reference. Excellent! Very complete, in colors, pictures..."
2,Porte Cable is supposed to be the best,I have owned 3 of these sanders and none of them will grip sandpaper very well. The clips suck. Granted if I wanted to use stick its it would work great but that is not what I bought it for. I have a dewalt 1/4 sheet sanderthat I have used the heck out of an not once has the sandpaper slid out of the clips. This a very frustrating and time wasting flaw.
4,Good sturdy knife,"Good quality knife with traditional Swiss red handle. This is an affordable luxury in your kitchen. Blade performs well, but not in a way that you are afraid of manipulating or hand washing the knife for fear of cutting yourself. And the handle doesn't compare to the rosewood of a fancier knife - but this is the most elegant plastic handle around in my kitchen."
5,Fit the bill exactly,Great way to ship CD's and DVD's. Affordable and convenient to use. Only drawback is that they're too square and require extra shipping due to them not being 'machinable' by the postal service.
5,Just perfect!,"These little sleeves work just great for sending cd's. Just slip the cd in, fold it over and seal and you're done!"
1,Not a good book.,"This book was not very good. There were no dimensions to the characters, no real growth either and the relationship wasn't at all believable. There was no large epiphany around her turning 30, which you would think was the whole theme of the book. It was a waste of my time to read this story so don't waste yours."
3,A little too long...,The book is well-written but a bit too long ...most chapters and details can be shortend without loosing the quality and well...it's just another romantic comdey...I don't see much novelty in it...it's an OK read I guess...
3,Pieces Hard To Dump Out,"The bowl and sea creatures are really cute. They are soft and feel good. Each of the sea creatures makes a different sound. They are hard to dump out of the bowl though, which made it frustrating for my child. It might capture some child's interest, but it wasn't the case for mine and we ended up giving it away."
3,"Hard to get fish in and out (fill, yes; spill, no)","The different fish are cute and well constructed, and I'm sure the fishbowl is safe (no worries about baby trying to put it over her head), but the opening of the bowl is so small, it's hard for ME to yank out the shapes. There's no way an infant could do it. Still, our kids liked playing with the fish shapes and were interested in the clear-sided bowl too. They just needed help manipulating it."
3,Soft toy for toddlers,"I bought this toy for my Granddaughter. The pieces are cute, soft, durable and come in their own container. What's not to love? Well, as it turns out, it is a toy made for adults for all of those reasons. The child doesn't seem nearly as taken by it as I was. It is never the one she seeks out and she doesn't play with it very long."
5,"Soft, safe fun","My grandson loves this toy, even though his little hands (at 8 moonths) can't always get the fish into the bowl. Great nap buddy cuz he falls asleep trying and can't be hurt by lying on it."
2,it sucks,i bought these for my nano and all it really does is scratch it. i gave it a 2 cuz it keeps it from laying around and getting even more scratched but i guess it wouldn't really make a difference
3,Nice option for carrying your iPod around,"These socks are wonderful for carrying your iPod arround without having to spend too much money. However, I have the biggest iPod of all (iPod Classic 160 GB) and I had some trouble fitting it into the socks. There was a little section of the iPod which couldn't be covered by the sock, approx 3 mm. Despite this, I imagine that with time and use the fabric will expand and that should be no longer a problem. For the rest of the iPods, I believe you won't have any trouble."
2,carol's daughter hair butter,"This product was not what i expect a use it after shampooing it tends to leave a film on the hair. It goes on smoothly, however, as it starts to dry the hair become hard. The smell is also too strong, this is my first purchase of Carol's daughters product and I expected more."
3,FAST SERVICE,"COULD NOT BELIEVE HOW FAST I RECEIVE THE ORDER! THE PRODUCT SEEMS VERY HEALTHY FOR THE HAIR, BUT DID NOT GIVE ME THE SHINE I WAS LOOKING FOR."
4,Good for twists,"I have 4B type hair and, when used to do two strand twists, moisturize my hair very well. I installed small sized twists on monday, took them out on Thursday and have been wearing a twist out since. I haven't had to remoisturize my hair at all since installing my twists with the healthy hair butter. I would recommend this product for two strand twists or a twist out."
4,Very Cute and Very funny remake,I Rented this after one of my friends told me about this he said it was'nt half bad.So i rented it last weekend i rather enjoyed it Lindsay Lohan is quite good. The scenery is is effective and the performances are all good. I rather enjoyed Lisa Ann Walters Performance which very funny and the pace of this movie is very fast for 128 mins of fun and romance.
5,This movie will make you jump into the pool!,"This movie is very good! It is good for a family night, a sleep-over with a friend, or slumber party!"
4,Great remake,"Lindsay Lohan was so cute in this film, I just want to pinch her cheeks! Out of the various films she did in her career, this is definitely one of the best. She plays a set of twins and does a nice job of it. The original version of this movie was good, and I am generally disdainful of remakes, but this one was pulled off rather nicely. Two thumbs up for a fun flick!"
5,Improvment!,"This movie was a great improvment over the old one, it was funnier, livelier, more interesting for children my age because it is updated.The acting is better and it is all-around a better version of the movie than the original. I think LL did a great job with her acting she (they) was (were) probably my favorite Character(s) I also like Jessie. But I thought this movie was a lot more exciting, and livelier acting than the first one."
4,Wonderful Film!,"In this re-make of the Halley Mills classic, I was surprised to find that everything was ship-shape: the acting was superb, the directing was great, the dialogue (though lacking in some areas) was Ok, and over-all it was great fun! The movie centers around two young teen-age girls who meet at summer camp and discover that they are actually twins, sperated at birth! The girls eagerly switch places, in hopes of getting their divorced parents back together. Of course, there are complications...great movie that makes the unbelievable plot, well, believeable, with the great acting and script. Way worth watching!"
5,A Treat,"Usually remakes are never as good as the original, but once in a while you are suprised and this is one of those occasions. Lindsey Lohan is remarkably talented and a joy in this roleand Natasha Richardson is stunning. Absolute joy to watch."
5,Great!,It is by far one of the best movies I have ever seen! It will make you laugh and cry guaranteed. I found myself tearing up in several parts. This is a movie to own for sure!
5,ABSOLUTELY A MUST-HAVE!!!!!!!!!!,"I have seen this movie more than 5 times already and I'm still in love with it. The Parent trap is without a doubt the best movie that Disney has ever made. It has both elements for the kids and the adults. It made me laugh from begining till end. I also cried three times the first time I saw it, and one more time the second time around. If you're still hesitating in buying this video, I hope I have convinced you enough that you will not regret it."
1,"Wishful thinking, travesty for children.","It's amazing to read all the positive ""5-star"" reviews of this movie. I think one reviewer got it straight by pointing out the devestation of divorce on children. There is always room for fantasy in film and fiction. However, a movie about murder, for example, would never be classified as ""heart-warming"". I am not in favor of censorship so they may go on making movies like this for as long as they want, but it doesn't mean anyone has to buy into the lies inherent in theplot. Children suffer horribly from the failures of their parents to stay married. And the parents DO NOT reunite in the end, so raising the childrens' hopes is rather cruel--unless one can regard this as an escape from an unpleasant reality. Movies like this raise good questions, though, such as whether such fantasies provide escapism or false hopes."
4,The Parent Trap,great movie to enjoy with family and it arrived quickly with no problem. never have any problems with this distributor.
5,FANTASTIC-THE BEST EVER,"This movie is the best!!! I am totally in love! Normally, in any movie I can decide on my favorite character -but in this one its a tie between Annie and Hallie! (if anything Annie.....I guess) Sincerly Victoria Schwarzl"
5,And I thought the original flick was outstanding...,"...but this new modern remake is just as outstanding, because it doesn't lose the feel of the first one. With no mention of the real-life crisis which has a great impact on children of divorced parents, I thought the movie was well-planned, put together, and had all its ducks in a row. I'm very surprised, however, that the Olsen twins were not portrayed as the twins in this flick, but Lindsey Lohan did great playing ""two parts."" Bravo!"
5,Brilliant Movie.,"I think it is the best video, that i ever saw. When I finished watching it (the first time),I thought-'This is my favourite movie'. I live in Argentina, and I saw it at the cinema. I want to know when I'll can buy it on video. Thanks a lot. I'll try to make a fan club,so write to me to: tatiana88@yahoo.com . Tatiana. P.S.: Congratulations Nancy Meyers, for a good job!"
2,"Good,but I like the orginal better! DVD lacks features!","This remake of classic of ""The Parent Trap"" is but I like the orginal better!To start off the girls were from New England and California(not California and England! ) . The makers of this remake threw in a bunch of unneed material(like the hotel junk,the women trying to seduce Dennis Quaid,the brief camping trip etc!) As for the DVD , it lacks extra features such as commentary from cast,director,behind the camera,production notes etc! What we got is another bare bones DVD that lack the stuff the other studios such as New Line,MGM,Paramount etc pack into thier DVD's ! if you want to see this movie check your library or your video store to rent the DVD before you buy it! Also Disney when are you going to release the orginal ""Parent Trap"" on DVD? also Disney start improveing your DVD's and bring the consumers the extra features we desire on this great new format that kicks VHS big time!"
2,Poor Remake,"The ""original"" of this film was not the 1961 film made by Walt Disney but a German film made in 1950 called ""Das doppelte Lottchen"" based on the novel of the same name by Erich Kästner. I recommend that American viewers try to get hold of the superior original version."
4,Romance Lover,This is one of my favorite Disney movies. I loved the original Parent Trap when I was growing up. I thought this remake was done very well also. Dennis Quaid is one of my favorite actors. Lindsey Lohan showed much promise as a great actress in this film also. I am sad to see how things have turned out for her.
4,Silly fun,"Bought this for a ""camping"" sleepover birthday party because there are some great camping scenes. The girls thought it was hilarious. We had some trouble with the DVD stopping and losing signal. Replacement was easy (no shipping charges, UPS pickup scheduled for us.)"
2,One too many alcohol scenes...,"This would be a great kids film, except the writers just HAD to put scenes with alcohol in it. One of the twins samples wine, the mother shows up drunk at the hotel, vodka is mentioned, please! This is a KIDS movie, why do they need to put that in there? I think I'll pass on buying this for that reason alone!"
4,Lesser of Two Evils,"Would we rather have 90210 dvds with errors and missing information or no dvds at all?I guess the former.But it's incredibly disappointing to see images manipulated and photoshopped (just look at the cover art for the pilot dvd...douglas emerson's head is on luke perry's body! plus, why isn't clare on the covers for seasons where she was a regular?!) and factual errors in the episode descriptions.The special features for the first four seasons were great, but there weren't ANY on season 5 and I don't think there is on 6.Wish they were releasing the series wholeheartedly. Maybe better luck if the complete series is released in one package?"
3,Childersburg (Images of America),"Having received a similiar book about the City of Talladega as a gift, I was anxious to purchase this book, as I lived in Childersburg and attended school there my entire life. I was somewhat disappointed when I received the book. Being a history buff, I expected more content concerning the past, but the book should literally be retitled ""Childersburg, Images of the Mathis and Finn Families"", as it is filled with umpteen photos of them. I realize the author worked hard on this book, but taking into consideration her father is a Mathis and her mother is a Finn, it turned out to be mostly a book about her family."
1,Not worth the $$,"In short: wore robe <8 times in the last month, robe now has 2 large rips along different seams. And it's not as if I was wearing it to scale fences or perform acrobatic feats. I loved the robe initially, but it is definitely not wearing well, and it's leaving lint everywhere. Strongly considering a return."
1,Sad! Sad! Sad!,"This was a terrible depressing book. If you like sad stories, this is the one for you. I read half of it; skimmed the other half and threw it away. I'm sorry I spent the money on it."
3,"SAD, UPLIFTING AND CONFUSED EMOTIONS","An amiga gave me the book to read before the upcoming holidays, I suppose to get in the right mood for the special days. She thought the book was wonderful. Two days later, another friend sees the book laying on my table and tells me that the book isn't worth the time. He didn't like the protagonists at all, especially Laura sending people on errands and not really talking totally and sincerely in her last hours.I read it and went from total frustration to sadness, but its value is that it makes you think about your own life and what can happen in just the blink of an eye. Of course, Jacquelyn is an excellent writer, and she did what good writers do, keep you interested and kick the thoughts and emotions into gear. I read it in one sitting and passed it on to another friend. Waiting to hear her reaction. I will definitely appreciate my family more during the big holidays ahead. Mahalo."
3,small lightweight but you still snuggle with the rocks,"The pad is inexpensive, light weight, rolls up easily. The flannel doesn't have a thick pile, so you don't get a lot of benefit from that. The 3/4 inch fully inflated pad doesn't buoy you enough to avoid feeling the varying ground beneath you. It is plenty long for my 6 foot 1 inch frame. My sleeping bag hangs over the sides as it is pretty narrow. It offers very little in the way of comfort, but I have not tried other similar products so I don't know how it compares. I'd recommend something that inflates a little larger."
1,Not Even Once Was Enough,"How humbling and yet reassuring that my college-cultivated taste for this sort of mind-numbing, time-wasting art film form has withered completely at age 50. Three-quarters of the way through this egocentric mess I hit the eject button and slid the offender back in the box. No regrets, however. Whenever I see a film video box with the name Peter Greenaway, I'll go reach for the original Diabolique for some good old fashioned husband-killing entertainment."
5,Great Product! Great Shipping!,This product came in perfect condition and it shipped super fast! It came in two days after I ordered it!
3,Missing some big hits,"This compilation contains a few of the biggest songs of SWV's career, as well as some album cuts, but this collection is missing some of SWV's hit songs. Some of the most important songs that this collection fails to include are ""Downtown"", a #2 U.S. hit, the Human Nature remix of ""Right Here"" (the original album version, a top 20 R&B; hit in it's own right, is included instead), ""You're Always On My Mind"", a top 10 R&B; hit, ""Anything"", ""Someone"", and many others. But, the one thing this collection successfully does is containing a good amount of songs from each of their albums. Overall, probably a must-have for the SWV fans since every track is remastered, but the casual listener should go forBest of SWVsince it has just about every single SWV released, as well as some pretty good album cuts."
1,"Horrible, nothing funny about it :/","Worst movie I've ever seen. I'm a huge fan of Wiz and Snoop, so the thought of both of them in a stoner movie was right up my alley, but it turned out being a complete waste of $, and time! It says you need to but be ""high"" to fully understand the movie, but that doesn't make a difference... sober or high, this is hands down the most irrelevant stoner comedy ever made, simply because it is not funny. Sorry Wiz n Snoop, but Mac n Dev should of went to acting school."
2,not so good but OK,The movie was OK..... not wat I was expecting from these two but I own it now so I wouldn't buy it again
3,Hope this is not nobbled like the Fugitive soundtrack!?,"I agree with the reviewer below. (Vitoskywalker) I won't buy this till I know that everything has been left in its original state. What CBS/Paramount did with The Fugitive (added new soundtrack) was criminal!Let's hope this release can be enjoyed by all fans of this wonderful show - how it was intended!Season One was fine (picture/audio); the only disappointment being that it would have been nice to have the unedited pilot included as an extra. Also, just because I'm a purist, I would have liked the original tags left in, included ""the mod squad in color"" on the beginning of each episode. But I know that's being picky. Hope we can keep the faith with this release."
4,A short but engaging early Scudder novel,"Lawrence Block's early Matthew Scudder novels are considerably shorter and less complex than later entries in the series. Scudder was still drinking during this time period and here he makes his first acknowledgement that it might be getting out of control. The plot is intriguing, a dirty cop begins cooperating with an anti-corruption probe and is framed for murder. Scudder must answer two questions who did the frame up and why did the cop suddenly decide to become a rat? ""In the Midst of Death"" is one of the bleaker entires in the Scudder series both in terms of its outcome and for what happens in Scudder's personal life. It is not an essential entry in the series, but it is a good one."
3,"Still good, but not like before","I believe as with most things, it is just plain hard to continue to please audiences. The earlier Spongebobs were hysterical because they were something different and outrageous. Season 5 is very funny, but it just lacks the wackiness of the earlier seasons. This could be contributed to my age difference after 5 seasons of watching Spongebob, and I am sure kids will enjoy it regardless. The quality of the animation is still top notch, the packaging is fantastic and everything is still quality stuff.Season 5 Volume 2 contains ""21 tales of deep sea silliness"" plus 5 Karaoke music videos as a bonus.Karaoke Music videos1. Bubble Song2. Good-Bye Atlantis3. Dead Eye4. Together5. If I could talk to moneyGet this to complete your Spongebob collection, but if you are starting out, go with Season 2 as I felt that was the funniest."
5,"SBSP Season 5, vol. 2","SPONGEBOB SQUAREPANTS IS THE BEST, I love spongebob, can you tell?This volume, #2, is the best of the season 5 pics also.I would like to add that I am sad that the newer shows,2008-10, have so much more violence in them. I guess I'm a wuss, but I like SBSP much better as a kind, helpful and lesson-learning cartoon fellow!Enjoy!leapardnose"
4,"Great game, a bit buggy, but a great game!!!","It's got a very good story, great character development, and the side quests are mixed. Even the voice acting and the dialog are quite good. The only thing keeping me from giving it five stars is the save system. Randomly, the game would lock up during the loading of a saved game and there was nothing to do but get out of the game and restart my computer."
5,Excellent,"Thank God for BioWare. This game is very fun and intuitive to play. The characters are good, the game mechanics and presentation are great, and the storyline is about as good as you can get from a Star Wars RPG. The villain is kind of a letdown compared to Irenicus from Baldur's Gate II but everything else falls into place nicely.Just a thought, don't level up your character beyond 5 or so before you become a Jedi, that way you'll advance farther as a Jedi and get more Force Powers. Earn all the EXP you can but don't do the leveling process."
5,Loved it..,Short and sweet... I loved the game and only wish that it would have been longer. Hopefully there is an expansion pack coming soon...
5,Stellar Game--Best Game Ever!,"Knights of the Old Republic is not only the most immersive RPG I have ever played (and yes, I played and loved BioWare's other offerings) but is also the greatest video game ever created. Character customization has enough depth to make it vital and interesting, but not so much as to bore. The plot is wonderful, and the freedom to explore different shades of the plot is unmatched."
2,Avoid the PC version,"I'm a PC gamer. I find that the games are generally cheaper and with the right system and graphics card look and play just as good. Having said that, my biggest problem with game manufacturers is when they make PC versions of popular console games and don't provide interfaces for gamepads. 'Knights has no joystick interface which means you must play the entire game via keyboard or mouse. Games that require running, ducking and shooting are difficult enough without having to remember if ""w"" or ""q"" moves left or right. Word to game developers, if you can't provide an interface for game pads, don't bother making PC versions."
3,Buyer Beware,"Let me start by saying that this game is extremely fun. I have a great time every time I turn it on, but then the bugs start! This game was obviously shipped in time to make the Xmas season, and it was not thoroughly tested. Go to the Technical Issues board on the Bioware website to see the issues.I've run across at least three different bugs, from problems saving to graphics problems, that have severly hampered the playing of the game. There are still no fixes for these bugs. If Bioware and LucasArts release a new patch (currently at 1.01 as of this writing) to fix these issues, I will gladly raise the score to 5 stars."
4,Playful writing that plays for keeps,"These poems are simple, yet often startling little gems. Thoroughly earthy and solid, they still manage not only to tell the truth, but to surprise us with it. I find myself reading these poems over the phone to friends."
2,Disappointing,"It took me a week to finish this book when it usually only takes me a few days. The main character Claire was at times unlikeable and condescending as were her friends Maddie and Max. The only likeable character was the love interest Jack but he was almost too perfect. The plot was predictable. Some of the situations bordered on unbelievable and the writing was often redundant. And then the ending felt rushed. A ""perfect"" ending tied up in a bow. All in all it was disappointing. I'm not sure I want to even try any of her other books."
3,Cheapie!,"Bought this for using as a ""guest"" reel. Works for what it was intended for and keeps my good stuff out of the hands of the untrained."
3,Still holding on DVD,"It was entertaining, however I bought it mostly because I have always had a thing for Lisa Hartman (Black). Pity she didn't make any more movies, but once she got married, that seemed to be pretty much it for her. The movie is entertaining but no block buster.Still Holding On: The Legend of Cadillac Jack"
1,Don't waste your money!,"I bought one of these a few years ago. It is not very sturdy. If the cover comes off, it is very hard to reinstall. The wheels will not stay in alignment. It will not stay ""folded"". What more can I saw. Buy something else."
3,"Describes Religious Pilgrimage, but Contains Little Religion","As a recent convert to Islam, I can only imagine what it would feel like to stand in the Great Mosque in Mecca with the hundreds of thousands of other pilgrims. Wolfe had this opportunity, but unfortunately, he did not sufficiently express his religious/spiritual impressions in the book. His writing style was a bit too objective and detached. It appeared that he carried the initial uneasyness he felt in Morocco (i.e. when he was afraid to enter the mosque) throughout the entire trip. However, I do applaud the honesty with which he described his religious upbringing and why he decided to become a Muslim."
5,Great value and lots of fun.,There are so many dolls in this book and each has many outfits. Each one is done with a great deal of detail.The quality of the paper is wonderful and will survive lots of play. I loved the fact that most outfits have hats to go with them.
1,Messy to use,"I loved the concept of this but it is messy. I got litter all over the floor when I was tipping it into the garbage sack, bits stick in the mesh and some fall out unexpectedly, and then you have to pour the remaining (dirty) litter into the other pan to get it on top of the mesh again - which releases dust, smells disgusting and just isn't a clever thing to do."
5,Almost entirely eliminates cat mess,"I bought this in preparation for moving in my new wife's cat, who was supposed to be fussy about litter boxes. She likes to dig (like a dog burying a bone) and she hates being trapped in a cave. Still, she took right to this box with no fuss and the only litter that gets out of it is stuck to her paws, which is unavoidable with any box design. The three-tray design is brilliant and you need to go look at the other reviews and read up on the ""awesome method"" for using them. The only problem with this box is that it is *huge* and doesn't fit in a modestly sized bathroom. It's too tall to go under the sink, too wide to go between the sink and the wall or the toilet, or between the toilet and the tub, and in the end the only good place for it was a corner of the bedroom. Still, better an unobtrusive litterbox in the bedroom than a pile of used cat litter on the bathroom floor."
2,Works great as a regular litter pan BUT,I STILL have to scoop and this is vastly overpriced for a regular hooded box. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!!!
5,Firewire Pci Card Adapter with Firewire Cable,"If you are looking for an inexpensive firewire Pci Card Adapter that is easy to install and use, look no further. The TRENDnet firewire Pci card adapter came with easy-to-follow instructions and a six foot firewire cable. I was downloading video from my camera about fifteen minutes after I opened the TRENDnet package. Thanks to the vendor for providing excellent quality at a great price."
3,Tie Clip goes on with blade down,"This tie clip is beautiful, but unfortunately, when you slide it onto your tie, the blade points down, which is opposite of what you would expect...unfortunately. I am tempted to break the tie clip part off of the sword and have it soldered on in the correct fashion, but that is not the point of buying a $50+ tie clip. Regardless, it looks nice, if you like your sword facing down..."
2,Chips ahoy!,"The Sango Splash line of dinnerware is gorgeous, no doubt about it. It's got a lovely combination of colors and textures and it feels great in the hand. So what's the problem? It chips. I've had a set of eight place settings plus various serving pieces and other extras for about two years. At last count, there were five pieces with chips and one cracked cup. That doesn't say much for the set's longevity, especially since I don't use these every day."
3,On Belay - Drops Climber,"This is an average book. It does not capture the true character of this special man. Paul Petzoldt's life would be hard for any writer to summarize. The author should have concentrated on a more detailed introspective of this famous man. Too much writing was centered on certain events that do not actualize his true persona. Yet, the author does reflect a reverance for Paul's achievements that are well deserved. An easy reading book."
5,Your Performing Edge- A Superb Realistic Guide,"I have been a Nationally ranked Senior Distance Runner and search eagerly for books on the subject of Running. Dr. Dahlkoetter has written a superb guide that has already helped my running and added value to my non-running life as well. I was most impressed with how realistic it is and how many great mental exercises are explained. Definitely a must read for anyone, whether they compete or not. I am the Training Director of the Big Sur Marathon and coordinate a series of training sessions for first time and experienced Marathoners. Dr. Dahlkoetter's book is on the MUST READ list, right along with Galloway and Sheehan."
2,Weak part keeps breaking.,The original part on the Braun blender lasted about a year. This replacement part lasted about a year too. Think I may spring for a sturdier blender rather then have to replace this part all the time. No more Braun products for me.
4,The Discovert of Genesis,"This work was very insightful offering a view of creation, the flood and Christianity from the Chinese written language prescriptive. Very well done. Thank you for this work.EW Aldridge, Sr."
3,A thought provoking look at how it feels to be 50 today.,"In typical Bob Green fashion, he makes us look at the things that are on the fringes of our thoughts , but never seem to quite make it to the foreground without a little prompting. If you are not comfortable with the idea of being 50, this book probably isn't going to make things easier for you. On the other hand, if you can handle being 50, this book provides an insight into some of the things you are aware of (unconsciously, perhaps), but haven't really taken the time and energy to really think about. Nobody who reads this book won't see some part of themselves in the narrative. It is entertaining, funny, thought provoking, and, at times, disturbing."
1,Vendor not responding,"This vendor has not responded back to me with the item. I have tried on several occasions to contact the vendor, leaving voice and email messages with no response. I was charged for item, but have still not received it. And have still not received a response."
3,Ok,"This item is a little cheap, the only thing I like about it is that you can zip it up and put it away. But I guess it's one of those things you can take to grandma's house for the occasional babysitting and just leave there."
2,Great idea; poor execution,"I used this toy because it was something easy to travel with. We were taking the baby on a week-long trip and wanted to make sure to have a toy that would keep him entertained. The toy was definitely amusing to him. He loved the colors and the toys that dangled from the bar. It was compact enough and lightweight enough that I could throw it in the suitcase. But like many other readers have described, there's nothing to hold the bar in place. The bar and the plastic piece easily pop out. The purpose of the toy was to entertain my son safely while I gathered needed items for the day. Unfortunately, I felt like with this toy, it was inappropriate to have the baby out of my sight for even seconds.I wanted to love this toy, but I just didn't."
2,Not so well built,"My daughter is now 4 months old and has had fun playing with this gym, she is now loving pulling on the flower and hearing it play music. But, I also have the problem with the arch popping out constantly. I'm surprised with the reviewer who hasn't had a problem - I can't figure out a way that it won't do this. Also, my older daughter was playing with the baby, leaned on this and broke one of the support pieces on the bottom. I like the idea of this really cute gym, but wouldn't recommend it to others."
5,Cute and Inexpensive Gym,This Gym is perfect for Moms on-the-go. It's easy to fold and store or fold and go. I love it!
2,Why review socks?,"I know, why bother reviewing socks?! Because your feet deserve it. Lame.Pros: looks cool for any adidas fan, comfortable padding, climacool.Cons: It's cheaply made. The material fuzzes up in your shoes creating pills. High nuisance.Socks are socks, but these kinda socks. :)"
3,good basic book,"Nice projects, up to date, but simple. Good basic book--I knew nothing about candle making so it was helpful. I wished there was more ""why"" in addition to the ""how to"". I did find when I was reading the what-to-do-when-it-goes-wrong section in the back that some of my ""why"" questions were answered.I bought this used for about $5 and it was worth it--but not the list price over $20.The book was written in about 2003 so it does not cover soy waxes and the new products on the market."
5,drawer liner,The price and the quality of this product was just right.This would cost twice as much in high end stores in our area.
1,Small bag,"Probably enough patches for one or two cleanings. Never have I seen this small a quantity of patches. I'm sure the quality is al right, I guess the ad looked larger that it really was. That one is on me, but it won't happen again."
5,Great concert!,"Stevie once again proves her timelessness in this show. An absoloutely spectacular prformance, both in song selection and presentation. I can't wait to see her in concert again!"
5,Stevie Nicks Live,This was received in great condition and fast service. I actually had it in a few days. Awsome dvd felt like I was right there at the concert.
1,Poorly made,I have no idea why this feeder got such great reviews! Feeder is very poorly constructed of 2 cheap plastic pieces that did not fit together securely. No suction cups were included even though the box clearly states that they should be. Definitely a return! Do not buy.
1,Window Cling Bird Feeder,"I had high hopes for this bird feeder, but it just isn't well made. When it arrived the two pieces wouldn't click together and stay so I ended up duct taping it rather than going through the hassle of a return. I recommend The Observer by Droll Yankee. It's worth the extra money."
3,Cheap,"This feeder is fun because you can see the birds eatting. BUT, it has turned yellow after a few months and the suction doesn't stick as well since it's gotten a bit colder. So now it's hanging by one suction. I guess that says something about the strength of the suction cup."
4,Great little window feeder that's perfect for apartments!,"I live in the city and was looking for a feeder that I could use that would make me feel less urban-like. I will admit that it took about two weeks before the birds (sparrows, mostly) felt comfortable enough to use the feeder. I lured them with seed just sprinkled on the sill. Now, birds are frequent visitors throughout the day. I have had no problems with the feeder suction cups or with rain getting in the feeder. A very good value feeder."
4,good little feeder,"The suction cups on this thing are surprisingly strong. Which i was worried about because its a 2 story drop to the ground from the window I have this attached to - but I haven't had any problems. The cats love it, and some of the birds are starting to wise up and know the cats cant get to them. its quite funny to watch, although I am pretty sure my little boy has killed his remaining brain cells when he lunges at the window. Picture posted as well."
3,Precautionary steps,"The product comes put together in two pieces. I was curious to see if the suction cups actually worked well, and they did. The drawback is where the two pieces meet in the middle - I had to use clear package tape as seeds were falling thru the crack."
5,Great buy!,"My husband and I originally bought these in town but hadn't been able to replace them, so we tried the net. We have two outside our casement windows in our sunroom (no sills and easy filling). They provide lots of entertainment for kids, pets, company of all ages. Fun and inexpensive. Gail in VA"
5,Very comfy~,"I ordered this backpack for my boyfriend. His 17"" laptop fits in the laptop pocket, but just barely. My 15"" fits perfectly. The ""yoke"" style straps are very comfortable and the waist and chest connector things make it much easier to carry a heavy load. My only complaint is that when I received the backpack, there was a small orange smudge on it. Someone was eating tacos while packing my item! It came off with a little soap and water, though. No biggie."
1,Too small.,"I'm not a big person and the medium was real small;I did not reorder since it ran so small, the large might not even be big enough, I'm 118 lbs."
2,not that funny,this movie was not as funny as i thought it would be it had a couple of funny scenes but it could have been funnier
2,"Not So Funny "":0(","You all read what the story was about, so I won't go into any detail. I grinned a few times, but didn't crack any big smile. If you're curious about the movie, Please rent it! Don't throw your money away like I did."
4,Supremely Silly,I've always felt there is something intrinsically funny about prison. This movie takes full advantage of that. Horrific events are handled so calmly. Codes of behavior are complicated. Convicts and officers alike are willing to do almost anything to entertain themselves. So much of what happens is random luck. Prisoners lose awareness of just how odd their world is. It's not depressing like an NBC documentary is.
2,Ummm not soo great,All I can say is that the anime is wonderful. It's one of the est I've ever seen but the Graphic novel wasn't great. I don't know why the anime seems better but it does. THe book does have it's moments though. It's just not something I'd read more than once. I recommend you borrow this from somewhere or just watch the anime and not waste your money.
2,Difficult.,"I admit to be a gaming novice. I expected better from Microsoft, that's why I purchased the item. To get the game to run on Windows XP, I had to completely uninstall my Norton Secuity program. I ran the free ride, how boring. The tutorials are a little better. While I was struggling with the installation process, I contacted the manufacturer for guidance. They basically told me to ""read the manual, dummy"". I think runnung this program on XP has created some problems for Xplosiv, and that's why I got the ""attitude"". Definitely a ""last ride"" for me."
3,Update on Previous Review,"Since posting my previous review, the author personally mailed me a CDR with copies of all of the files noted in the book. He gets a 5 star review for the content of both the book and the CD and his personal effort to provide copies of his files. His powerpoint files were particularly useful.However, the 1 star rating remains for the SME - despite their promises, they never provided either a replacement CD or access to their PDF files on the CD that were included on the CD. In addition, their arrogance and poor implementation of a digital rights management system with poor usability and appearant compatibility problems was extremely disappointing and in poor judgement."
4,Replacement parts,"The actual cutting blade is heart of the Braun blender. The blade is very effective. However, the blade is driven by the motor by means of plastic teeth on the underside of the blade mechanism. The plastic teeth seem to have a limited ability to withstand the wear and tear of use. Expect to replace the blade periodically if you use a blender a lot."
1,"Should have worked, but....","I bought this blade to repair my blender and it was listed as the correct part, but it wouldn't come in contact with the drivers well enough to turn the blade if more than water is in the blender. A big disappointment but at this cost it was not worth returning. Now I'll have to buy a new blender."
3,My son loves this.,"This book goes with the DVD. Together it makes a great gift iteam. My son just turn two. He had this book since we was 18 months. He loves to read about the Potty and watch the DVD too. Ofcourse, doctors says that the best time for boys to start potty training is around 2 1/2 years and your boy will really understand it my 34 months. So don't aspect any miracles with this book but start showing him the Dvd and read this book to familiarize with the concept of going to potty. :)"
3,Use your own words with this book,"I checked this out at the library, but am still looking for another book to purchase. When I read this to my 2 year old, I make up my own story and words to go along with the pictures. The other top reviews here ring true with me, also."
4,Great for sitting on the potty,"Great for sitting with your little guy and encourage him to do his thing. I was a little disappointed in the slang name for the anatomy -""pee-pee""."
4,My son likes it ...,"He likes it, and he talks about Joshua (and has memorized the story, for the most part). But he's still not trained. Oh, well.My only complaint about the book is that the potty looks like a giant vase rather than ANY potty you'll ever see. Otherwise, it's an easy read and entertaining for 2-3 year olds."
4,Once up on the potty...,"The book is very cute, I got it for my 16 month old son to show him, in his language, what the potty is used for. We are not ready to actually USE the potty, just to show. But I am optimistic when the time comes, he will figure it out!"
2,There are better choices for potty training,"I bought this book along with several others for my potty-training 2 year old. He has no interest in this book, and frankly it is confusing and long. He prefers other books about pottying, especially books showing potties that look like his. The potty in this book looks like a vase. The text is geared for an older child or adult but in some places is just strange. I will not buy the girls version of this book when my daughter starts to potty learn."
2,potty is too old,"picture of the potty is an actual pot, and i don't know if kids can make connections with the actual toilet. who uses a pot in this society these days anyways..."
2,Let's reinforce gender differences from the start,"It's great that little boys who are being potty trained are learning that they have a 'pee pee' and all, but what the heck is a 'pee pee' anyway? I always thought that 'pee pee' comes out of a 'wee wee' and not the other way around.I was originally intrigued that there were both 'boy' and 'girl' books...is their anatomy so different that they need different books? Apparently not, as the 'once upon a potty-girl' book also says that girls have 'pee pee's'...So I guess the only difference is the color of the flowers...not sure why you need separate books. It's nice though that they have a spanish version of this volume too so our espanol speaking friends can teach their children the value of gender differences too...blue for boys, pink and purple for girls."
4,Flood Light? Yes. Dimmable? No.,"At least not for me. Either goes on or off in my dimmable table lamp, whether its warmed up or not. Fortunately, I don't really care (I only wanted a fluorescent that is capable of working in a dimmable lamp-- I'm not really intersted in dimming). So I'm happy with it. Puts out a lot of light for 15 watts (equiv to probably 40 or so incandesent watts)."
3,The Boys In The Band,"This dvd/cd release is for avid Gentle Giant fans only. Others should start with the new 35th Anniversary cd re-issues such as Free Hand, In A Glass House, or the fine live release Playing The Fool. The bulk of the dvd footage is from two television performances filmed during the mid - seventies. The German footage is showing some wear although fans will be delighted with the excellent performance. The U.S. TV performance is also very fine and the video quality is very good for it's advanced age. Long time fans will also enjoy a 2005 interview with lead vocalist Derek Schulman produced by VH-1. There is also a full band interview produced by an Italian TV station dating from the mid 70s. Unfortunately, the band's commentary is dubbed in Italian. This release also includes a companion live cd which is of poor sound quality. Like I said, it's for fans and completists only."
1,rip off,This is sold as 9 inch but it is less than 5 inch. This is a very misleading ad and they do not respond. DO NOT BUY THIS RIP- OFF !!!! Only a tiny bungee cord ! Not good for anything!!! DO NOT BE FOOLED!!!!!!!!Heavy-Duty 9-Inch 'Bungee Ball' Elastic Cords - Set of 25
1,Crap,"Not worth the money. They are not flexible, difficult to put together and very short individually. Do not recommend over regular bungie cords."
2,NOT A GOOD CHOICE,tHIS BOOK HAD FAR TOO MANY DETAILS AND TOO LITTLE STORY AMD CHARACTERIZATION. i DID NOT CARE FOR THESE ASPECTS AT ALL.
5,A towering achievement !,"I've been reading Keegan lately and enjoyed every word. I normally prefer war novels like The Naked and The Dead, The Triumph and the Glory, or films like Saving Private Ryan, to histories, but John Keegan is such a gifted writer that I always seek out his books and read them, often two or three times."
3,son loves it,My son loves his nap blanket. What I love about it is that it folds up nicely and has a carrying strap. The only downside is that it can not be washed often. My son uses it for pre-school so I wash it every weekend and the pillow is worn out and can no longer be used (that's why I'm on Amazon to buy a new one). It is small in size so not recommended for boys 5 and over.
1,Awful!,"We used the bag ONE time and it ripped, after the flight to FL we went to retrieve the gate check bag only to find the seams coming apart/ripped. I would advise that you spend extra money on a QUALITY product...."
4,Very helpful when flying!,"The quality isn't great, but the price was! This bag made checking our stroller so much easier and the stroller came out in perfect condition. It was also really nice when exiting the plane to know which bag was ours...everyone else that had checked strollers in garbage bags were ripping bags open in search of their stroller."
2,Meh.,"This did not fit my Chicco Trevi stroller. We used it on one leg of the flight but it was more trouble than it was worth. Airline handled my stroller just fine without it, save your money."
2,Ripped on the first trip,"The bag fit my maclaren stroller perfectly. It did protect it on the plane it was filthy when we got it back. Unfortunately one of the seams ripped, I feel that happened pretty quick. But I am glad all the dirt and oil is not on my stroller."
1,Destroyed on first flight,"We purchased this bag to gate check our very light weight umbrella stroller. When we picked our stroller up after the 1st short flight (We had 3 to get to our final destination), there was a huge tear along the seam of the bag and a hole at the bottom. After our 2nd flight, it was much worse, and by the time we got to our final destination, the bag was useless. We were glad our stroller was covered, as the bag did protect it from getting dirty, (but we could have done that for free with a trash bag).I wish we'd spent a little more and gotten a nicer stroller bag that will last. I can not recommend this product."
3,Average,"Bag is good for the price. Yes, it's not as durable as other more expensive bags but you get what you pay for. We use it for gate checking, so it doesn't get mishandled or worn as much as if we would check it in as an additional bag. Note: does NOT fit the Chicco Liteway umbrella stroller."
1,Cargo Bag for Stroller,"Don't buy this bag for your stroller,, a waste of money !! it was made with cheap material and was ripped after the first time it was gate checked at the airport which is what it was sold to be. Upon returning home the bottom of the bag was nearly completely all ripped up... very poor construction.. DO NOT PURCHASE !!"
1,Good idea in theory,"I bought this for a two week vacation where we would be flying to multiple locations. The stroller fit into the bag fine. It was awkward to carry and it tore after the first flight. It was just a little tear, no big deal. By the second flight the stroller was hanging out of the bag through a gaping hole.I like the idea but it just didn't work. It might be my fault, maybe I needed to buy a more expensive bag. It actually was easier on the last legs of our trip to just gate check the naked stroller."
3,Gate Check Bag,"I have had this bag for a few months bought it for my Inglesina Swift stroller, great fit. I keep it in my car trunk. Quality not so good, its fraying already and I only take the stroller out occasionally. It's gotten dirty but I am afraid to wash it because it seems it will fall apart."
1,Simply terrible,"I had high hopes that this would be a useful device. It is not. I bought 2 of these. One does not work at all. The other works, but not nearly as well as advertised. It has to be shaken HARD and FAST for about 1 minute. The result is bright light for about 1 minute. You get dim light for maybe 3 minutes more, then you start over.Its not even good enough for emergency use, much less regular use. I have heard that there are ""wind up"" flashlights out there; I will research those and give one a try to see if it works any better."
5,A New Classic,"What a brave author, tackling two controversial subjects in one single masterfully-written novel. Did I read it, dream it or live it?"
4,Great Alt To Bulk Tabers,"This is great... From the hospital to the field, this will clear up some questions. It is quick and easy to use. My only request is that maybe they will release one with pictures and video. I have used it on the Ambulance, ER, ICU, NICU, Helicoopter, I use it everywhere. This is well worth the money.Tray NREMT-P NAEMT / NFPA"
4,"Great music, poor packaging","If you want to get some Joy Division on CD, you need to get this box set. It's just about their complete discography of official releases and contains everything you need - both studio albums, all the singles, and a nice bunch of live recordings. The music is outstanding - kind of a blend of the Doors, The Cure, mixed with a Sex Pistols edge... you can tell JD were a huge influence on U2 and many other bands that followed. Really they have a unique sound all their own that stands out from everything else before or since. The packaging on this box set though flat out stinks. The 2nd time I opened mine it fell apart, seriously. And while the book is thick, the information isn't that good - the writer tried to be artsy and it doesn't come off well; I would prefer a detailed band bio and stuff about the songs. But if you want Joy Division, Heart and Soul is THE item to get. Highly recommended."
4,Highly recommended episode(s) in Season 5,"The ""V for Vachon"" trilogy in Season 5 are my all-time favorite Hawaii 5-0 episodes. Classic stuff where 5-0 takes on the Vachon family, literally one by one. The season 5 collection is worth the 30 bucks just for those three episodes!"
5,Great t.v. police story,"Hawaii five-o was a police story that was one of a kind. I enjoyed the series when it first was on tv. Book um dano was a neat phase. I lived in hawaii for a few years and enjoyed seeing it filmed on location. I could relate to the streets, and locations. I also enjoyed seeing some of the star who were not at that time big names in television. Beautiful scenic shots of Hawaii. Would recommend to anyone who like seeing police work being done in a great locale.Mr. Savage"
3,Does the job...,"Performs satisfactorily. I am surprised that the ""neck piece"" is plastic instead of metal. It seems durable enough, but I have not had to challenge it to much in a servere environment."
1,Horrible Picture quality,"I bought this movie because I remembered how funny it was when it was shown many years ago. However, the copy I got was impossible to see because the scenes were very dark and unrecognizable. This product should never be retailed in this fashion...would have given it zero stars if it was optioned!"
1,Disapointment,"I only used this book to prepare for the Elementary Ed Content Knowledge test, and it was beyond useless for it. I took the practice tests and got pretty upset because I wasn't able to get more than half the questions right in each of the sections. However, I just got my scores back, and not only did I pass but I scored above average. The practice tests are in a format that is not exactly like the test, the questions are poorly writen, and they cover areas that are not covered on the real test. If you are looking to prepare for the Elementary ed Content Knowledge test, don't waste your time with this book."
2,Sloppy,"This study guide is full of typographical errors and factual inaccuracies. If you are taking the Praxis I, I recommend Arco's study guide. I found it to be closer to the actual test. If you are looking for a guide to any of the other Praxis tests, especially Elementary Education, don't get this one... keep looking."
2,"If you are taking the PPST, find another book!!!!!!",This book is the exact same copy as Barron's- How to prepare for the PPST and Computerized PPST. This book is not worth the money!!! The Audio CD is also worthless.
1,waste of money,This product is very lightweight and seemingly useless. Most pocket knifes would be a better alternative than this. Would not recommend.
5,Good idea,"I've never had to use this product, and don't ever want to. But it's hefty enough to do the job. Keep it in your console box or velcro it close by. Not in the glove compart where you can't reach it when needed.Price is right. I've ordered one for each member of my family. They say it's the best gift so far. I think that's because it's the thought that counts."
4,LifeHammer Original Emergency Hammer (Orange),Product is well crafted and constructed. Fortunately I have not been in a situation where I had to test its intended use. Bought another one for my wife's car.
2,Smaller than expected,"I've purchased these before. This one looked normal size and nothing was mentioned, of course, that it was smaller than expected. When it arrived,I felt duped."
5,this is funny. blond!,"I bought this hair dye to actually dye my hair blue because the product says quick blue, but it's in fact blond, thus it made my hair blond. I was in a total of shock and stupidity. Overall, the color came out great!! I recommend this dye to anyone who wants blond hair or streaks."
2,Platinum? More Like FLATinum!,"This CD is missing many good songs! I'm not sure why I bought it, I think I was drunk. It's missing some great songs like...Night Is Falling In My Heart, Imagine That, One More Day, Beautiful Mess, I Believe, Unbelievable, You're Gone(careful! there's a song on here called ""It's Gone"", that sucks!), Love a Little Stronger, just to name a few. Diamond Rio Greatest Hits would be a smarter buy with a much better selection of hits. They need to come out with a new greatest hits containing ALL of their hits like the ones listed here and many others. This CD is a jip!"
1,It's a RIP OFF,This is basically the repackage of DRio's first and second albums which both were good. But calling it PLATINUM COLLECTION is a LIE and rip off. And they sing GOSPLE. Go figure.
1,Full details not revealed,"This is a 36-pin connector. I needed a 25-pin and searched in vain at the Amazon site for the pin number. I went on faith (I know, bad idea with Amazon), that it would work. It didn't. Now I have to send it back and am probably out the shipping. Apparently I wasn't the only one. Package had been opened already. Ripped off again by Amazon."
2,Difficult to use properly....,This was very difficult to use. The channel for the cord was not really large enough (and I was using a Belkin Surge Protector bought at the same time). The strip was so curled that it took a long time to get it to lay flat enough to apply the double stick tape. You might consider laying it out flat for a couple of days before you try to use it!!!
3,Okay for one cord,This cord concealer was cheap and that's exactly what it is. It came in a 6 foot section all rolled up. That means it now won't stay flat on the ground covering your cables. Its okay if you run one cord through it but forget about more than that. This concealer is meant for one cord and is not very durable.
3,Great!,"This product does exactly what it says it will do. There is some double-sided tape to tape it to the floor, but it doesn't cover the entire cord concealer. The way this item is designed, it actually needs DOUBLE the length of tape that comes with it. That being said, it lays pretty flat and works well. I put it under a door and the door doesn't seem to damage it all given the friction.Like other reviewers stated, you need to flatten out the concealer first. I didn't try the hot water, but just putting weights on it for a while will be sufficient."
4,Belkin Cord Concealer,"I ordered 4 of the six foot cord concealers. They worked very well, I think the company should add to the product that heating the concealer will help to straighten the concealer. I used a pot and let the concealer sit in the hot water for several minutes. The adhesive worked well also."
3,"I liked the plot, hated the ending... it needs closure!","This is my first Fern Michaels book, and I did enjoy it... really. As a matter of fact, I found it hard to put down. Which is probably why I was so disappointed with the ending. I can only hope that Ms. Michaels wrote it with a sequel in mind. I found some of the plot a tad bit implausible, but this is fiction...right? I did enjoy the friendship between Jessie and Sophie... that is so rare in romantic novels. I was a little creeped out by some of the parental behavior...on both the natural and unnatural parents' parts. The dialogue was stilted and trite in certain places, but Ms. Michaels more than made up for it in others. All in all, I would recommend the book... just read it knowing that it might leave you feeling like the printer accidentally left out the last two or three chapters of your copy."
4,I liked it,This is the 3rd book I have read by Fern Michaels. I liked it a lot. I had a hard time putting it down.
5,This is a book to love and treasure!,"How could anyone not love this book? It had everything, drama, love, true friendship excitement and best of all, a dog that was every bit as wonderful as the main characters. A wonderful book!"
3,Tears of a Tiger,"Tears of a Tiger is a sad book. It is about Andy Jackson, a teenager, who gets in a car wreck with his friends while they were drunk. Robbie Washington, Andy's best friend and star of the basketball team, dies in the wreck. Andy feels responsible for his death and gets depressed. He has to learn to live life while getting over Robbie's death. Andy was my favorite character because he had to put up with his tough life and friend's death. He had nobody to turn to, and he felt all alone. I liked this book because of the realness and sadness. It showed me what could happen if you drink and drive. The thing I did not like was the different types of writing. It was tough to read sometimes. Three things I learned from the book are that looks can be deceiving, always think of others, and drinking may not kill you physically, but it can kill you mentally. I recommend this book to people who like sad books."
5,Tears of a Tiger,"Tears of a Tiger is about a teenager who accidentally killed his best friend, Rob, in a car crash because he was drinking and driving. Andy soon learns that what happened that night will affect him for the rest of his life.My favorite character was Andy, who learned about the effects of drunk driving. This book tells a very touching story about what he went through after Rob died. It was very depressing, but I also thought it was realistic.I would recommend this book to anyone who has ever thought about drinking and driving or to anyone who would like to read a really realistic book."
2,Tears Of A Tiger,"Tears of a Tiger is about a boy who killed his best friend in a car accident,and he's trying to get over it.I liked the way the kids used slang language,one example is,""You be trippin."" I really didn't the book to much because they talked about death,and sucide.It was a really depressing book,all they did was cry,or talk about their problems.I don't reccomend this book because it's very depressing."
4,Tears of a Tiger,"The book, Tears of a Tiger, is a wonderfully writen book. It tells of teens who are struggling with the death of their friend. The book is a mix of journals, newspaper clippings, and conversations that make this book stand out. It is a very good book and I would reccomend it to everyone."
5,A Must Read,"I thought this was a great book. It was one of the best books I have ever read. It teaches teens of the harms of drinking and driving, and parents the struggle teens go through in life. It was a compelling book that made me realize the pain of losing a person close to you. I think it is a must read book for anyone, and is a definite 5 star book."
3,Tears of a Tiger,"Tears of a Tiger by Shannon M. Draper, is a very realistic book. The teenagers in it act the way teenagers really talk and think. It shows how careless actions can lead to disaster. When a best friend is killed in a terrible car accident and fire, the main character becomes more and more depressed. Nobody can reach him. Teenagers who think drinking and driving is okay should read this book and learn an important lesson. Adults trying to help teenagers who are depressed should read this book to learn how to get to the teenager before its to late."
4,"The book was a life like thriller,but didn't have enough act","This book will make you think about how much you have,for example this book is about a basketball superstar(Robbie)who is killed in a car accident and his friend Andys troubles dealing with the death of Robbie.They were both drinking and this emotional life like book should change your mind about drinking and driving and one mistake can kill you and theirs no coming back so think before you make the biggest mastake of your life."
4,probably the best,well i think that it is a very good book and it was sad. most of all i think that people should not drink and drive becuse it will have consequnces and people have to live with them for the rest of there lives.
2,OSI Marine Lab Red Tiny Bits Super Fine 3oz,"Bought this when I could not find my normal OSI product, and my fish just didn't take to it as well. Replaced with normal OSI green label asap."
4,"Nice earrings, shipping, not so much.","These are a very nice little pair of silver peace sign earrings. I purchased them a few days ago along with another pair of earrings, and while both pairs are small, having them sent in the same box, in the same envelope, but having to pay shipping on both as separate items I feel is a bit much, so be warned. The size is nice, about the size of a pinky fingernail, and I am not allergic to them, even better ! So, four stars out of five, the knockoff being the slightly expensive shipping. I will still get things, as there's some WL items yet, but now I'm more the wiser.Sabby, combine shipping if you're going to combine packaging."
3,it's ok,"i thought it was a good movie. But a little drab. i got tired of seeing the same scenary. Don't get me wrong, i like Fred Hammond. But the movie needed a little spice. A change in scenary. Maybe more feeling in the main character. But i am all for supporting fellow Christians. To my knowledge this is his first movie? So overall not too bad for a ""first"" movie. Oh, and it seemed a little extra long. Is it over 1.5 hours? I didn't time it. I gave it away as a gift."
4,Too Small for Sig Sauer P232,I liked the holster itself. However it was too small for the Sig Sauer P232 to fit so that the strap could be closed to hold the gun in place. The gun is quite snug. FYI: I ordered another holster from a different brand and had to return it since I had the same problem. But I've kept the Galco. Perhaps the A Galco holster for the 40 Caliber Sig Sauer might be a better fit!
4,A nice read.,"This rather small narrative is enjoyable, if for no other reason, to travel back in time a bit, to a different era ... when Block was younger, as we all were.The perspectives are dated, given new ""rules and protocols"" of flying in our 21st century.Block's insights, however, are likely to be as timeless as our own humanity.While perhaps not quite as sharply defined as his more contemporary (and therefore, more mature) work, I enjoyed the read, and would recommend it to any fans of Lawrence Block's characters."
1,Book should be titled 100 best quotes of all time,"I have never reviewed a book before, but I felt compelled to do so now.I finished this book in 15 minutes and I am not a fast reader.I wish there some substance to the book. There are no examples of sales techniques."
4,Great book on chess analysis,There are several chapters in the book on analysing and decision making. The chapter on The technique of anlaysis and decision making is very important. Several key concepts which had never before been examined are explored. Consider the chapter a modern update to Kotovs work. (Think like a Grandmaster).The book is a vital purchase for all aspiring IMs & GMs.For those trying to become masters the above chapter is compulsory reading.Unfortunately the book does not adequately cover Attack and defense. There is only one chapter on attack (After castling on opposite wings) and one small chapter on defense. The bulk of the book covers the thinking processes in relation to Attack and defense. In terms of a basis for analysing Chapter one is compulsory reading and you should make your purchase decision on that basis. As to the rest of the book its only optional.
2,Works great... until the warranty expires!!!!,"When I purchased this printer about 18 months ago, I was very impressed. Having some networking knowledge previously, the net set-up was relativly easy(although I had to go beond the manual to get it running smooth). I preformed without problems for quite some time until just about a week ago, when out of the blue, no warnings at all, started giving me the little blinking ink light and kept teling me on my comp. to change my cartridges, even though I had changed the cartridges 2 weeks earlier and it had been doing fine. I called Hp and got the usual forigner who told me that I was screwed. It's just another example of cheap throw-away electronics. I'm thinking twice before my next Hp purchase, if I ever make another one!"
3,"As the title says, At a glance","I purchased this book as a user of FrontPage and chose it for its quick interface. I did not buy this book for deep content. This book lays out in short precise steps how to insert, create, manipulate or use most every feature within FP2000. That is great for a user who would like to simply apply something to there page to see how it works. Unfortunately, there is only cursory information here: barebones really. For somethings like formatting text, that is fine, but for advanced level users, we need more in depth explanation. I use this for prepping exercises for students, but not for content about the web or the components I might be using. As I said, the title does say at a glance!"
2,GUESS WHOS COMING FOR DINNER,"Maybe I'm getting too old or maybe I've seen too many horror movies but it seems that there's a fine line between entertainment and exploitive voyeurism. OFFSPRING lays on the gore and blood without any real regard to plot or acting, offering nothing but torture and sadism. This is the weakest of the recent Ghost House releases--THE THAW and THE CHILDREN are much better. If you're into this type of film, you'll probably enjoy this one."
5,Rich's prose,"Rich Mullins once said that there were things he wanted to say, but he couldn't figure out how to make them rhyme for his songs. Fortunately for us, Release magazine decided to give Rich just such a forum. Rich's last page colums ran in Release magazine from 1991 through 1996. This book contains al of the articles plus a brief overview of Rich's life and work, and an afterword by Rich's producer, Reed Arvin. Mixing stories from his life with Scripture and quotes from other Christians, Rich never failed to turn out an engaging and though provoking article. Gorgeously illustrated with photographs from Ruch's longtime friend, Ben Pearson, the book is a testament to a unique voice that left us all too soon. If you enjoy Rich's music and ever had the chance to see him in concert, then you will enjoy this book."
4,Good for the money,Pretty good for the money. If you are really picky about quality you should get a more professional model - this is economy grade. The versatility of this scanner is awesome since it can be taken off the base and used to scan large items. I also like that it takes up minimal desk space when stored on its base. That was the main selling point for me.
1,Horrible- don't buy this scanner!,"Although it looks cool...the quality of my color photos are horrible. They have the vertical bands on dark areas (that others have been complaining about) as well as tons of ""dust"" spots...no matter how much I clean it with a lint-free cloth. I never had these problems on my older cheap scanner (non HP). I contacted HP support and they were nice but unable to fix my problem. The best answer they could give is that the bands may be caused from ""interference"" from other electronics. I find it interesting that so many people are having the same problem. I also have trouble getting the photos straight since they tend to move after they are put in the scanner...and since the scanner is smooth there is no guard to rest the picture next to if you take it out of the holder. The software is not very good...does not offer multi-scanning...so it takes forever to scan a lot of pics!"
1,WORST EVER - A ZERO RATING,"Scanjet 4670 - Don't listen to anyone who says this scanner is worth using at all. What is the purpose of having a scanner that scans alternating light and dark bands through the image. HP has sent me three so far and I will be speaking with a Manager after they get back to me in 3 to 5 business days. I have been in Design for over twelve years and never have like HP much but when I wanted to get an inexpensive scanner I thought it would be OK? WRONG! Never will I buy anything HP again. Maybe I just expect my images to be absent of stripping, silly me!I guess if you want to scan in a blank piece of white paper or very pale images you might like this scanner?"
5,Lemongrass Jumbo Fiesta Mugs,I love my mugs! They complete my 12 place settings and three colors of Fiesta dinnerware that I use everyday!
5,my favorite mug ever,"I have 4 of these mugs all in different colors and LOVE them! I love them so much I will only use these and none of the other billion mugs we have. I love them so much I give them as gifts stuffed with candy, cocoa or whatever. They are very durable, beautiful, huge and just great. My favorite is the persimmon but I dropped it one day. The handle broke off (Fiesta Ware is very good about not breaking even if dropped) but it was a very clean break and I love it so much I refuse to give it up and still prefer that one over all the others. Fits perfectly in the palm of your hand. Great buy, great gift, great mug!"
5,Defend with Root,"Bill Root's ""How to Defend a Bridge Hand"" is an excellent book that teaches one to learn the foundamentals of defence in bridge. It covers all the important facets of the defence. The quiz after each chapter and the 36 random quiz are useful for one to review the materials covered in the book. No doubt one will benefit a lot from reading this book. The only concern for me is that the problems presented in the book and quiz are all with the goal preset: you need to defeat the contract by ""exactly"" one trick. I would like to see the book include problems involving, e.g., matchpoint considerations and judgement on when to take the tricks (sometimes setting the contract is not the goal of the hand)"
1,Worst printer I've ever owned - Won't buy HP products ever !!!,"Installation went okay except for wireless which is an absolute nightmare. Prints great, scans to PC when it wants to, makes horrible noises (which HP does not seem to care about or offer solutions to),drivers stomp on camera and other software, causes ""My Computer"" to go into search mode until I finally had to uninstall the printer from my main work PC. Private tech help websites offered some temporary solutions which involved disassembly and plugging power in/out while powering on. All too much of a hassle. I've spent dozens of hour working ON this thing but I figured out the permanent fix. Remove network and power cables, open second story window, grasp printer with both hands and toss out window. Now go but ANYTHING BUT AN HP PRINTER!!!"
2,Three-in-one... It's a compromise.,"Although the software is bloated, and prone to crashing, I have to say that it's a nicely-built piece of kit.My problem, which hasn't been echoed by anyone else here, is that black/deep colours are prone to banding. This is an issue I haven't seen in bubblejets for some time.I get better results from my HP940C which wasn't very expensive, and is two years old!Don't get me wrong - it's absolutely smashing to be able to do colour copies of docum ents without having to scan them into my PC first, but the whole unit does, on the whole, strike me as a bit of a compromise."
2,wireless installation is a nightmare,"Great machine - lousy installation. I can't use the wireless capabilities. My first attempt at installation was botched because I was getting an error that even HP tech support couldn't solve. Their suggestion was to return the unit and get another one. Unit #2 wouldn't connect to my network with its wireless capability, called tech support again and held for a 1/2 hour before I gave up. So I'm using the ethernet cable...it works fine now but I wasted 3 evenings of my life on this machine and it still doesn't work how I want it too!"
1,Printer SUX,"DEP errors, scvhst errors , cust support is horrible, maybe it will help as a fish trap in the botom of the lake, I will never buy an HP again"
2,Good Printer.... Horrible Software (workaround),"We bought the printer for the WiFi capability. However, over WiFi it would lose data, take forever, and printing was sporadic. I finally hardwired it to my router. I still had to install that horrible software when all I wanted to do was print. I discovered of you only want printing, install it as an HP DeskJet 990C. That works great. I can still scan by HTTP and do local copying. If it were not for the 990C discovery, I would have thrown it off a bridge. The software is huge, slow, and full of bugs. HP really screwed up on this. Outsourcing to India is not always a good idea..."
1,Not good at all.,"I have only one thing to say about this video:DONT BUY IT! It isn't even Don Giovanni at all. it is just a video that talks about the actor, & gives a 30 second summary of The story of Don Giovanni. I dont care at all about this video, & as soon as I watched it, the only thing I could say is ""What a rip off!"" Trust me, & don't buy this video. In fact, this video deserves -10 stars instead of one"
2,Recommed This Book With Reservation,"As all of you know already, all (except some exceptional textbooks by distinguished authors) Addison Weslely Mathematics books are well known for their terrible excercizes, explanations, lessons, and their contents. There are a few reasons why the above statement is true, but you can figure them out by yourself. Also, lack of information that hinders AP Calculus B C students further emphasize that this is a book made for the novice mathematicians of extremely low ability in problem solving and thinking. Overall, this book is not a book that can be used in an Advanced Placement Calculus BC class; and indeed, this book would a terrible choice for a short calcululus class at a university that offers a good quality mathematics education. This book definiately receives a ""poor"" recommendation; its contents must be enhanced for it to receive a better recommendation from the instructors and learners in the United States."
2,what the....,"When i downloaded ""no tears"" on amazon's mp3 service, i didn't know it was the chopped and screwed BS until too late, why don't they have the original?"
2,Canon MFC-730 a better buy,"I have this printer at home, and a MFC-730 from Canon at work. Canon cost $100 more so I skimped at home, and have I regretted it since. Printing function is fine, but scanning is slow and scanning multiple pages into a pdf is trial-by-software to get the thing to work. And the software itself is overly complicated and was designed by a newbie programmer who wanted to impress with all the bells and whistles, without understanding that people want simple, effective functionality.Spend a few extra pennies and save yourself the frustration."
1,Could not install - Bad support,I bought this unit from Staples and was very excited at having my first AIO. I had read good reviews on the Amazon site and was thinking I got a good deal at $100 (refurbished).The printer just could not be installed. I am an IT Professional and understand technology a little more than a lay person. I tried everything possible to get this installed. I managed to install the drivers for scanner but not the printer. I changed my USB cable (HP Not including USB cable is very irritating).The support over email and phone was prompt but not useful. They kept telling me the same things which I had tried and not worked. They were unable to provide any insights into why the problem could have occurred.I do NOT recommend anyone to buy this machine. I have read other reviews on the web talking of installation problems. I hope HP fixes this problem soon.
1,Won't intstall,"Well, I tried to install with the CD that came with it, then was told from the ""chat"" tech support to copy the contents of the CD onto my computer and then try to install. That didn't work. Then I spent about 3 hours with tech support on the phone downloading the installation software from their website. That didn't work either. After all that, they told me to wait for a week and a half for them to send me another installation CD.I'm no computer guru, but even I have the common sense to conclude that there is either a compatability problem, or the printer is defective. I'm not waiting for another CD because I need a printer now. Thanks a lot HP. >("
5,Well Pleased,"I am well pleased with this printer. Installation was easy and quick. Up and printing in less than 30 mins. Color printing is good, faxing is fast and easy, scanning is a snap. Recommend this printer for home use."
1,Mac Users Beware,"HP abandoned the Mac software upgrades for their signature 6110 all-in-one, leaving Mac users with only the copier functions. There are excellent alternatives from Epson, Brother and others that don't have this track record. If you are a Mac user, please be aware of HPs anti-Mac past policy."
1,How It Hurts!,"Like most modern technology this HP printer will give you more grief and malfunctioning frustration than useful service. Oddly enough, the rule applie to almost any other gadget that is suppose to make our lives easier, faster and more comfortable...not."
1,Not worth the aggravation..,"I own this printer a little over a year and regret the purchase. It paper jams regularly as does the printer cartridge. I cannot print more than a page or two without it jamming. It requires constant attention and a print job that should take 5 minutes can take as long as half an hour given all the fits and starts. I doubt the repair is worth the price so we will be purchasing a new, better one."
3,HP OfficeJet 5510,"While I am satisfied with the speed and ease of ordering from Amazon I have to say I am not that pleased with the printer. Our whole computer system and photo printer are HP so I thought I would be certain to get a wonderful printer. This printer seems like it was something that was released 10 years ago. While it does multiple functions none seem to be of spectacular quality. I don't think this latest update to our HP family will be the last, but it will certainly make me research a bit more."
2,Short planned obsolesence,It's quite annoying when a product has to be thrown away after 2-3 years because the cost of a minor repair is greater than the cost of a new one. Our HP Office Jet 5510 no longer feeds paper and the Geek Squad says replacing the barrings costs more than a replacement. Do we need to be a throw-away society? I'll do more research before buying next time.
1,My review of My other life by Paul Theroux,"There was some insightful lines in this book that made it worth its price such as: A brillant writer's ability to enter the readers soul, that was the key....and how did a writer do this. And...I knew what few readers knew - that you had to be that particular writer in order to write that particular book...] The first half I felt was boring - -boring people he knew in England, maybe because I am American and didn't know them. I almost put the book down but plowed ahead, it picked up with the separation from his wife and became interesting again."
5,The best guide to all the sports cars since 1945-1990!,"The book is great!It has a lot of nice pictures both in black and white and in color.This book tells you of all the sports cars I could think of and much, much, more! It's great!"
4,"""A Good Catch-all Sampling of the World of Sportscars""",This is a very good cross section of the international sportscar market. It includes a lot of small production runs as well.Any body with an interest in sportscars will greatly enjoy this book
3,Joseph Smith,"This book was ok but nothing great. I liked the book at the start but a little ways into it Widtsoe had trouble keeping my attention. He does cover a wide variety of topics which is the reason I rated it so high, but doesnt follow that many topics into much depth. Read it if you have the time, otherwise I would suggest something else.If you are a Widtsoe fan you will like this.The good thing about this book is that it is not a biography, which has been written so many times over they are a bore. This is topical according to his teachings, philosophy and the way he lived his life. It does give biographical sketches here and there but do not count on it to give you a very detailed history of Joseph Smith, but more an overview of his teachings and lifestyle."
5,excellent collection,"Cindy Sherman's work is inspiring. She's deadly serious about not being serious. This book is a great collection of her Untitled Film Stills collection, which happen to be my favorites in her body of work. Great introductory to her art."
4,It could have been a 5star video...,"It's almost 30 years now that I have seen this film in its original italian version.What a great movie!One of the strongest depictions of passion I have seen on the screen!As for the actors,those of you who appreciate european cinema will have the opportunity to watch a great Mastrogianni and a formidable Antonelli,an actress I realised I'm still in love with besides the many years I had to see one of her films.Now, let me comment on the VHS I bought.The quality was fine.I couldn't expect more!..Still, the english version has been cut here and there as if it was heading for distribution in Saudi Arabia!This is the only great minus of the video that I noticed with utter frustration.Besides, the story is stil comprahensible and realy worth seeing."
4,RIP HST,A good collection of Dr. Gonzo's prophetic writings. I wish he and George Carlin had collaborated on a book of essays or dialogues. The perfect anecdote to the Mainstream Media!
4,Hunter S. Thompsom,"For fans of the good Dr., This rates right up there with his other top sellers.His slant on the American Dream is certinally unique."
5,"Inside the Titanic, a cut-away book","My 7 year old grandson just loves this book. He reads everything he can get his hands on about the Titanic and this book is his favorite. The cut-away is really nice for young children and allows them to see just how the ship was laid out. The pictures, and facts are easily memorized by young readers----------a great book."
3,"Good, but not great","Sigh, since Condition Red, it seems more and more difficult for Iron Savior to produce a full, quality album.First off, I'll start by saying that album isn't bad, but it's definately nothing to write home about either. I'm not going to stand a preach about how songs should be hooky and all sing along, but let's face it...Titans of our time is probably one of their best and hookiest songs ever.Nothing on this album, with maybe the exception of Cybernatic Queen really leaps out at me. A good majority of the songs, I find are rehashed and boring. Personally, back to the drawing board guys."
4,Great for Grama!,"We bought this little guy for a song on Black Friday at Walmart - you don't want to know what they were selling it for because it was equal to the price of their cartridges..okay we spent 68.88! It not only paid to brave the crowds after Thankgiving, but it pleased the Grandmother who only wants to make copies of obituaries to send to her friends. Morbid, but heh, if you were 79 and lived in the Cold Belt of Upstate New York, that's about all you'd have energy to do after you unfroze your fingers from shoveling snow all the time! Anyway, ""Grama' just loves this printer, as do all her grandchildren who frequently visit and scan in pitures or email papers into their college professors. Cool! It is a real favorite of everyone, especially easy to work and lightening fast when it comes to comes - watch out if your standing in front. We used to be die-hard CANON fans but HP has sold us on this one. Thanks! From now on you will be called Heavanly Printers!"
1,Noisy!!! Bad CD Install Software!!! No Good!!!,"Do not waste your money on this piece of crap!!! Its sounds like theres stuff broken inside when printing and the CD install software does not install correctly. Nothing but Problems!!!I really like HP so I decided to return this printer and get a diferent model, so I ended up getting the (1610 All-in-one Model) for about $30 bucks more, and it works Perfect! No regrets with my new HP (1610 All-in-one Model) works like a dream, I highly recomend it."
1,don't buy it !,"I purchased this item. No problem with the software, but oh brother, was the hardware a piece of junk. When I called their tech line I reached some guy in India who tried his best. Turns out they'll replace your unit, if you give them your credit card number, great idea, huh.......having that float around in space, god knows where. The only other option was to mail them your unit, at your cost, and wait for them to send you a replacement sometime in the future.......so they got your original purchase price, your shipping cost, and now your malfunctioning unit. Why don't I feel good about this? Don't buy it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Not for Mac users at least,"I got this printer several months ago and have had nothing but problems with it. It won't turn off, my computer (Macintosh iBook) doesn't recognize it and when it was working it was slow, loud and the print quality was terrible (despite going through the calibration protocol several times). I thought it might still be of use as I could still make copies by hitting the ""copy"" button on the printer itself. No such luck, pressing ""copy"" illicits no response from the thing. I'd avoid this one - it's going to take up a lot of space in the trash can, too!"
4,"GOOD, SMALL ALL IN ONE MACHINE",This is a very nicely designed machine. The buttons on the left are easy to use and to replace cartridges are a snap. Very nice images both color and black and white. My cousin owns one and I use it all the timeIt's small size but nice photo reproduction make this a wonderful item.New Jersey Jig
1,Disaster trying to install software - beware,"I got this printer on 8th Oct 04 - and have spent 3 days trying to install software - with no joy. You are likely to need an expert skill level to be able to install the HP Software - see HP noticeboards for dicussions on subject. I have tried the CD - which slowed my PC down to a crawl, I downloaded the 450 MB! update from HPs website - 5 hrs later still not able to get past 28% without a crash (takes 30mins to get there). Then tried this again and again and went through all the HP troubleshooting options - none worked (I have XP Service Pack 2 - is that a common problem?). Tried the minimum install - drivers only - no luck. Have just packed back in box - its going back. Been the worst software experience in 10 years!"
1,Junk.,"From day one the printer would not load multiple sheets of paper. It had to be hand fed each piece or it would give a paper out error. Canceling print jobs will not stop the printer. Now it has died with the notorious ""pint cartridge error"". (Yes tried everything and new cartridges.)Save your money and get something that doesn't make your life hell."
4,Excellent,Some excellent information included in this book. The only thing that diminishes some of this information is that a lot has happened in real estate since if was published in 2006.
3,parental lock?,"This DVD displayed a ""Parental Lock"" that required a code to unlock it for full viewing. I still have no idea where to find the unlocking code and therefore had to return it. However, I was able to get some sequences to play and in the background could hear the music during the battles which included some profanity. Nothing in the reviews indicated a parental advisory, so I thought it would be a good purchase for my nephew for his 7th birthday. Oops! Nothing against the music - just wanted to put a warning out there for anyone who is considering buying this for a child."
3,SNMP/HTTP missing,"Overall, this is a great unit at a reasonable price. However, the main reason why I selected this UPS over others is the ""SNMP/HTTP"" feature... this implied to me that there might be an ethernet port on it. Not so.After receiving the unit, it turns out that- it does not have ups monitoring software for the Mac OSX- the Mac (at least Lion) does not detect this ups when connecting the cables- there is absolutely no mention of either http or snmp in the manual (searched the pdf)If you are on Windows or Linux (kernel > 2.6.12), then this is a great fit for you. If you are on a Mac and you would like the mac to shut down gracefully when the power goes down, keep looking."
5,Beautiful earrings,"These are beautiful and well made earrings. I would definitely recommend, especially if you like the two-tone gold look!"
5,Received as a gift - now I want more,"I love this collage of frames because of the 4x6 photo size. I just picked through all of the pictures I've taken over the years and filled it in no time. I have mine hanging, but it also has a stand if you like to display it that way. I'll probably order a couple more and dedicate each collage to a specific family member, I like the brushed aluminum."
1,A fair multifunction with an ugly surprise,"For about $250 you get a machine that will do a variety of tasks, but will not do any of them really well.As mentioned the software can be problematic.I also had a problem setting the fax function to work on a voice line.A problem I discovered about new HP(and Epson)products is that these machines use smart chips in their ink cartridges, and that these cartridges are now time limmited. They have an expiration date! This limits cartridge refilling and forces consumers to toss good cartridges and go buy new ones periodically.For these reasons I suggest you look at Canon or Brother."
2,"HP abandons users -- says, ""spend more money""","There are no Vista drivers for this unit.When you call HP to resolve issues, you are offered the ""opportunity"" to buy more HP junk.Honestly -- a little driver is not that hard to write.Shame on you, HP."
1,Save your money and time don't buy,"terrible tech support,no longer phone support off to India for chat support. If a cartridge is bad can't fax or scan stupid design. Software never worked right on PC.. has great features but don't work so why bother!!! A Lemon"
2,Not a bad book but needs significant improvement,"I am a lecturer and used this book for my class.I like the material presented in this book. It contains many examples and discussion on real applications. However the organization of this book is not good. It is just like putting several people's work together without appropriate coordination of the material.As a second edition of the book, it contains too much errors. You can find many errors in almost each chapter. I have to check carefully before I use their examples, equations and solutions. Otherwise I will get embarassed by letting the students pointing it out in my lecture. It is absolutely a shame.If you are an engineer who are already familiar with data communications and can tell those errors, this book is a good choice. But if you are a student, I sugget you stay away from it unless it is the textbook chosen by your lecturer."
5,A Sweet Devotional,"I selected this devotional for our Bible study group because it was especially good for those who haven't had a daily devotional time. This fit the bill perfectly. Not only is it good for those who are new to personal Bible study, it is provides a rich time for those who are well versed in the Bible. Excellent!"
5,mommy who loves books,"This book is fantastic. Not only is the story itself great, but it is also great for bringing up a multitude of topics for discussion with your child; bullying, prejudice, intolerance, low self esteem, fairness, etc...My children both loved this book. While the book carries a message, it is not dry or hard to read. On the contrary, the book flows beautifully and whether or not you choose to make the book a discussion piece, it is well worth reading just for the wonderful book that it is."
5,Dora's Singing Sensation,My son has really enjoyed this video. He sings along with it... and sings to it even when its over!!!lol!
3,not my favorite dora movie,"It just isnt what i expected. It isnt the usual format that the other dora movies follow, it is simply a collection of songs from the other adventures. It isnt bad or anything i was just a little disappointed, especially because it seemed like it was over so quickly. i should note however that even though i wasnt impressed my 2 yr old loves it."
3,Realization,"Conflict Resolved?: A Critical Assessment of Conflict Resolution has been very insightful into the real world of conflict analysis. This book does an excellent job of bringing to light many common misconceptions which the general populous has of mediators and negotiators. Through careful analysis of these skewed misconceptions, Tidwell does an excellent job of moving into what elements of mediation and negotiation truly involve.On the whole this book was really insightful, although a bit too text-book'ish for anyone looking for a quick and easy read as the content can be dense at times."
2,Happold offers little to the serious student of mysticism.,"This book had very little to offer the serious student of mysticism. The first part of the book was an attempt at classifying mysticism into various categories, which ultimately proves to be of little worth. The second part of the book provided the reader with excerpts from mystical texts. These excerpts do not provide any adequate insight into the nature of these mystical texts nor the mystics themselves. The first part of Happold's book is a gross over-classification of mysticism while the second part of the book is an abhorent reductionism of mystical texts which renders the ""selected passages"" meaningless.-Kory Harris"
4,"Good, but","I have loved Kitty Burns Florey's writng for a very long time. Her strengths are present- clear characters, ample, but not overwhelming detail, and a sincere affection.However, I found the structure of this otherwised fine book disorienting. Unlike Margaret Atwood's _Cat's Eye_, another novel which plays with structure, this only regresses until the last chapter, a not entirely satisfying wrap-up.The strongest, most interesting character is Nell. There is no explicit sex, but Nell's lesbainism is dealt with in a forthright manner.I want to like this book more than I do. I am not sorry I read it, though."
4,Wonderful,"Souvenir of Cold Springs is an engaging novel about the lives of eight young women brought together by lineage, love, and shared pain. You will grow to empathize with all of these women whose lives parallel and intersect each other in striking ways. A wonderful weekend read, Souvenir of Cold Springs reminds me of the value of females. . . our complexity of hopes, dreams, and secrets.This series of vignettes is pieced together in a marvelous web that shows us the common threads of existence including love, death, and change. Florey writes in a scrumptious manner detailing the commonplace, frivolous thoughts that make her characters so realistic. I would highly recommend this book as a thought provoking work on what ties relatives and more aptly women to one another."
4,Womens Cowboy Boots,"My wife loved the boots, very comfortable and stylish.Would recommend boots to everyone."
5,Cow Girl boots Got Me back stage at Toby Keith,"These boots are AWESOME Comfy and a Great Deal. The Bottoms were a little slick but All you have to do is scuff them up on the cement a little and your good to go. I got Lots of Comments on them too. They are great for stomping around a Toby Keith Concert all night in the rain. I think I might buy them in Brown too, Just because I love them so much!"
2,Not super-helpful,This book is minimalist in the extreme - a real beginner is going to need fingering exercises and weeks of practice before mastering even the most basic chords. And this book doesn't give you sufficient guidance in those crucial initial stages. Is it a good buy? Yes. But it's not enough to replace a teacher or a more thorough book/video set.
3,Some what disappointing for Gilbert Morris,"After all the wonderful books in the Appomattox Saga, I was slightly disappointed with the eigth one. Stars in Their Courses was still a good book, but it didn't keep me as entertained as the others.I would still reccommend it though."
2,Not One of Herbert's Better Efforts,The first half of the book is very interesting but the ending is a big big disappointment. It seems that the ending did not match the build up of the first two thirds of the book. One expected a thrilling finale but to the extreme disappointment of this reader got a ... B-movie type finish. Herbert's Rats trilogy is easily a much more interesting read and to my opinion the best books he's written to date.
4,Great Printer for the price,"This is a good value printer. Just does what it says. No bells and whistles, but a decent printer."
1,Add another to the list of failed power,"Don't bother buying this used or new. In fact, avoid Westinghouse at all costs. This TV is a complete lemon and should be avoided. Died after about 14 months of very minimal use. From the sounds of other reviews I won't even bother with customer service. Live and learn I guess. Avoid Westinghouse!!"
1,Seriously Bad TV,"Zero Stars!! I bought this TV for my sons college dorm room. Out of the box the picture was OK but the sound quality was horrible, like the old TVs in the 1950's only worse. I bought external speakers and they worked fine, right up to the time when the whole TV failed on day 3 of ownership. Westinghose sent me to a local repair shop, who charged me $100 to diagnose the problem, and another $100 to swap out some parts. (Whatever happened to the concept of a warranty?) Three days later the set failed AGAIN. I marched it down to a dumpster and tossed it in. Now it is where it belongs, in a landfill somewhere. I will NEVER buy another Westinghouse product, trust me on this."
1,"This is a LEMON, be careful!!!","I purchased this model exactly a year and a week ago in SAMs. Westinghouse told me that since it is out of warranty there is nothing they can do and that I'm just the 0.25% of the unfortunate customers with this model. How curious that most of the bad reviews on this same model in Amazon, Ebay, tvmanualsonline, complaints board, etc., are happening close after warranty.If you base your purchase on brand recognition then forget it, Westinghouse is manufacturing pure LEMONS now."
1,"Poor quality, failed after 14 months","I bought this in late January 08 from Best Buy as a spare set for my bedroom, which I used maybe once a week. Today I tried to turn it on and it didn't. I pulled the power, waited a while, and when I turned it on I get a garbled pitcure from cable, and with direct input from my DVD player the screen flashes on and off. No audio, unusable video. Makes me wish I had bought the extended warranty..."
1,Don't buy,"We've had this tv for 14 months and it no longer turns on. After doing a search online I found that this is a common problem for it to no longer turn on shortly after the warranty expires and westinghouse won't do anything about it. I have emailed them, they responded with a phone # which lets you leave a message and no one calls you back. We paid $300 for a tv that lasted a little over a year, next one will not be westinghouse."
1,Ripoff TV,"Just want to add my experience to the ratings. Had the TV for maybe 2 years, hardly used. One day it just wouldn't turn on. After reading the various website ratings I don't think that I'll bother to attempt repairs. It's junk and retailers and consumers should beware."
3,Frustrating,"Bought this for kitchen HD.Good: Nice HD picture. Fairly simple screen navigationBad: Horrible connectivity. All the ports are bunched up w/in millimeters of the other- to make matters worse its on the left-hand side.Ugly: The HDMI connection. When switching between SD and HD sources using your HDMI cable-you will get a blue screen. You will need to cut the power to your source 1-4 times before finally arriving at a picture. I took the first back to BB and they said its something w/the encoding system for the HDMI connector. Hmmm funny, my Panasonic plasma doesn't have that problem.Summary: its a nice set for a nice price if you can put up w/the maddening problem w/its HDMI switch.Side bar: I've tried cheap-o HDMI cables and better-made cables and you'll be smart to use the better ones. Yes a digital signal is a digital signal-but brightness is a big issue w/the cheaper ones.Bluejeans cable or monoprice cable is the way to go."
1,Dead after 10 hours,"I had this TV as a compliment to my bar downstairs of my house. At best it saw 10 hours of actually being turned on. I tried to turn it on today and it's dead. No power at all. After reading online, I see why that is. This TV is JUNK!!!! Obviously a production flaw that they should be held liable for."
1,Westinghouse SK-19H210S,"This tv worked fine for 15 months. Now, it won't turn on at all. I've noticed that this is very common for this tv. I will never buy another Westinghouse product."
1,Avoid at all costs,"Like the other Hayduke books, whatever relevance this one may have had has long since passed. Pretty much outdated and useless, and not even very entertaining. Go with Victor Santoro instead."
2,Not interesting if you read the other books,"Overall this book was a C-. If you read any of Trump's other books then this one didn't really give you any more insight. The one facet of this book that I found interesting is how much money his father actually had, and how much his siblings have. Other than that, it was a pretty mediocre book."
3,Billy Elliot,"I did not like the language, the 'f' word being highly over used and inappropriate. I was disappointed that there was no professional ballet shown, only the lessons. The story itself is moving and entertaining."
3,Fun - but not all that.,"Think Rocky in tights.The performances are solid, Jamie Bell a find, the father great. We've seen the story a million times before. The 'powerful' scene where he dances in anger I found irritating. Cliched on the teacher, Granny, Brother characters.Great soundtrack though.Want to see a great movie with the same themes get 'Kes'."
2,Little Kid Go To Dance School and Dance Like Sissy,"Complete B.S. I Don't think there was a good part... It featured a little kid dancing on a roof being watched and/of laughed at by a little girl. Nice acting... total B.S. Other reviews many say other wise but trust me, it suck!!! Guys, you won't like it, you'll probably be forced to watch it anyway by your girlfriends. Sappy people, watch it it's exelent! (That was a joke...) Oh yeah... the little girl offers to show Billy her bossom... (I think she's like 9)"
4,Jamie Bell!! Mmmm..worth the rental fee!!,"The movie was OK, but hottie Jamie Bell really stole the show. He's 15 and absolutely SIZZLES. I saw him in a tux for the Oscars, and I seriously almost drooled. *hott!*"
3,Widescreen Version,Did not see anywhere in the advertisement that this was a widescreen version and the digital copy had expired 12/31/12. Scam.
1,One of the worst movies I've ever seen.,"This movie was one of the most awful movies I've ever seen. The dialogue was boring, the premise was unbelievable, and I had to work very hard not to fall asleep by the end. Predictable plot takes you nowhere. Please, don't bother."
5,Billy Elliot,"For all you skeptics, this is a must see movie. I had read so many good thing about Billy Elliot in publications I wanted so see what all the buzz was about. I talked my wife into going and we were both blown away. It was one of the best feel good movies we had seen in ages. We loved Jamie Bell and can't wait to see him in something else. He is a delight as well as the rest of the cast. We both think this was lost in the shuffle at the Oscars. If you haven't seen it yet take the time to do so!"
5,The power of will,"Stephen Daldry made a charming and engaging movie with this personal portrait about a boy who was born to dance in the middle of a miner village in Durham.After the initial attempts, his steeled stubbornness will launch to capture the vital essence of his dreams against all the odds.Haunting, exciting and tender, the movie will catch you from start to finish. Superb cast and flawless script will make the full round to become it a legendary status as one of the most reminded cult movies of the nineties.By any circumstance, you should not miss it."
5,Looks great and is convenient,"I love this hamper because it looks better than one of those cheap plastic ones and it is stowable - So far I haven't had occassion to test the stowability, but in case you finish that huge pile of laundry and don't want a hamper in your way....it does fold up.Overall, the product is very sturdy. There is a mesh netting reinforcement inside of the canvas, and the wood supports are solid."
4,Evil is as Evil does,"I read with absolute disgust the so-called non-review of this book by Seth Frantzman. He sounds just like the Nazi's he condemns. This was not a review but the ravings of a homicidal,evil,racist human being. How did the holocaust happen? Because people and attitudes like Mr. Frantzman unfortunately exist. How could Amazon print this disgusting piece of trash by this pathetic little Hitler who's sole complaint is that there was not enough murder going on in WWII to satisfy him....This man never even read the book. The cure for evil in the world is the cold light of truth not lies and this book does justice in uncovering a dirty secret that the ends do not justify the means. Just because the Nazi's murdered civilians and terror bombed cities does not mean we can, That's why we are the good guys. Acts are evil no matter who is committing them or what excuse is made for doing them."
5,Birdmouth bits,"These bits work great. It takes a little practice to get them set up correctly. There were no instructions with the set I received, but they are available on-line from the manufacturer. The online instructions include a very helpful equation for determining the width each section needs to be in order to obtain a given diameter polygon."
4,Another Good Powell Book,"Turn, Magic Wheel provides the expected Powell wit and Powell plot and every sentence is read-out-loud perfect. This time, she places her characters in a tangled web surrounding the publication of Dennis Orphan's novel. His novel is based on the life of his only real friend who is an ex-wife of a Hemingway-type writer. Turn, Magic Wheel does not, however, match Powell's later works such as The Golden Spur or The Wicked Pavilions. Powell does not yet seem to have completely found her narrative voice and this leads to some hurky-jerk story telling. At times it seems as though she hasn't decided whether she wants to be a witty Henry James or, well, Dawn Powell."
3,"Interesting, but not engaging","The writing is very good, but somehow this story of 1935 New York City never comes to life. The characters are interesting and their situations were new to me, but I never really cared about any of them. It just didn't grab me and I was sorry about that."
1,Interesting? Try a waste of time,"I don't like giving bad reviews, but I just hope I save someone the trouble of reading this book. Okay, so it's not that bad.......but where was the action? the suspense? the element that makes you never want to put it down? If you can be patient with a slow moving book, than this book is for you. I guess I was too young when I read it to really get anything out of it. I thought it had no point and I have no idea why it recived an award. If your looking for a meaningful book by Krumgold, pick up ....And Now Miguel. Although a slow moving book as well, there was at least some point to it. I really am sorry this book was such a disoppointment for me, and maybe it will be your favorite book in the whole world when you read it, and maybe it just wasn't my kind of book. But do think about what sort of book you want to read before you pick this one up......."
2,Onion John,"The book I will now tell you about is Onion John by Joseph Krumgold starring Andy and Onion John, the main characters. It takes place on Senitary Lane where he lives. When he had just turned twelve Onion John came to town. He has to win a bet or else he will get a bad review in the news paper. He said to the reporter that he couldn't see himself in the picture. By getting the reporter angry he almost got in big trouble, but he won the argument."
1,Defective? Battery issues,"I purchased this thermometer before my daughter was born. I put the battery in when I received it. The first time I went to use it, the battery was dead. I thought maybe we'd left the thermometer on (even though product claimed it automatically turns off after 10 minutes). We got a new battery, which we installed. We made sure we turned the thermometer off after testing it. When I went to use the thermometer within three weeks of installing the new battery, the battery was dead. It's too bad, but this thermometer was a complete waste of money."
4,Useful strategies and insights for mediator and facilitator.,"This book not only presents a good summary of the process of mediation in the public sector, but also provide useful insights about the theory behind the proposed strategies."
5,Another masterpiece from Spike Lee!,"You'll laugh, cry and get MAD AS HELL, as you watch the incredible 2-part, 4-hour absolutely fascinating documentary about the aftermath of Hurrican Katrina and the horrendous and unforgivable BP oil catastrophe!From the many problems and con jobs connected to the corrupt Bush-Cheney administration and their cronies before and after Hurricane Katrina, to the inexcusable and unconscionable BP oil disaster, Lee speaks critically, but fairly to the good guys and the bad. Just as the people of New Orleans and surrounding areas were starting to recover from nature's Hurricane Katrina (and poorly-built levees, etc.), they have to contend with a man-made disaster of horrendous proportions, the BP oil tsunami. That most of them can keep going in the face of all this adversity is commendable in itself!Good work, Spike Lee and HBO! ""If God Is Willing and Da Creek Don't Rise"" should be seen be everyone who is concerned about the welfare of humanity and this planet."
5,It's the best.,"This book is the best about classical mechanics I had see. It has many many exercises, and a lot of useful examples.É o melhor livro de mecnica clássica que já vi. Didática estupidamente acessível, é realmente incrível. No tenho dúvidas que é o melhor livro de mecnica clássica que já usei."
4,A amazing book about the difficult words of Jesus,"This book offer a interesting and amazing view about Jesus's difficult words, show us its mean from hebraic perspective. Its argumentation and bibliography are very good. An excellent book to christians that want learn more about The Message of our Savior."
3,"Master Lock 7101D Heavy Duty Key Safe, Holds 48 Keys","The box works fairly well, however, the latch for the internal hinge out plate is not very sturdy. It bends very easily and I get the impression that if it gets bent to often it may break. The latch needs to be designed better, the method of latching is dependent on the metal being bent back and forth instead of some type of hinge."
4,"Chicken Soup, Cheap Whiskey, and Bad Women","A fasinating trilogy. Fulker is able to give the reader just enough legal information so that the plot can be followed without an overdose of detail. It will keep you on the edge of your seat through the final hour of decision. The three cases included in this trilogy are true but due to the author's literary skills, they read like engrossing fiction. This book should be on everyone's reading list."
4,Sharlene's remarkable review,"Ellen Tebbits is a superlative book. Ellen has a secret she does not want anyone to know. She encounters a girl. Austine is from Story, California. Austine has the identical secrets Ellen has. Ellen and Austine become really good friends. In Austine's house, they make brownies. The girls get in a titanic fight, and Austine gets a new friend. Will the girls become friends again? This book is the best book. You should read it. This book is interesting, exciting, and successful for all ages!"
3,Roux-Mousse,I have used Roux Fanci-full mousse for 6 years and it does great for my fine limp hair. i wanted that item when i ordered the rinse which does nothing for my hair. i love the color and the rinse is great if you like it but i prefer the mousse . i have a hard time finding this product.
1,Review on Fanci-full temporary hair colour,"My hair is very light brown, almost blonde and I bought this product in plush brown hoping for a rich dark hair colour. I applied it all over my head and the result was pointless. No change was made except my hair colour turned mousy and i STRONGLY ADVISE YOU NOT TO BUY THIS PRODUCT. It is so bad and I wish i had not bought it. :("
3,Not Horrible,"...by any means, but definitely not great, and perhaps not even good. What bothered me most about this book was that Nabokov seemed clearly uncomfortable using English. This may be his second book written in the language, but its prose is often awkward and stiff. Because of this, the poetic and playful nature of his best work is DOA, even if he tries hard to insert it in here and there. Reading this book, it's amazing to consider that his next was ""Lolita,"" where his use of language makes me cry with envy. Also, the plot doesn't seem as well thought out or executed here, and seems more didactic than what I expect in a Nabokov book.None of this is to completely damn the book, it was often quite enjoyable and far from bad, but it is not nearly as good as he was capable of making it, and glaringly so."
5,great,We had a shelf collapse and lost a lot of our variegated Fiesta ware dishes and bowls. Our original source no longer carried them and then we located these. They are perfect and the color choice was great. Shipping was reasonable and timely. Any delay was addressed immediately.
4,Excellent Fence Charger for the money..........,"This fence charger is inexpensive but a good one. However, it is a constant voltage one. That means the fence is constantly charged. You must take this into account if small animals and children are in the area. If they are, you need a fence charger that pulses, the interment pulse allows an animal/human to pull away if it contacts the fence thus preventing electrocution. Very good fence charger for the money but treat it with respect.............. I will give it 4 stars and not 5 due too there being no indicator light to show when it on and it is not a pulsing model............"
5,Timeless and Breath-Taking!,"I have never heard Ronald Isley sing anything that he didn't give his all. I have been a fan of The Isley Brothers for as long as I can remember although I prefer Ronald over ""Mr. Bigg"", the timeless voice has transended all generations. I bought the CD because I knew that Burt Bacharach has written some of the greatest loves songs of all time, and he is a master Pianist. I wasn't dissapointed at all. Truly a gem that I can't stop playing. In between the Heartache, I Need Your Love, Alfie, just to name a few, are some real gems. Trust me, even hard to please listeners will NOT be disappointed."
4,NEED TO REVISIT THIS CD.,"HAVE PLAYED THIS CD A FEW TIMES, BUT HAVENOT REALLY LISTENED YET.THIS WAS A HEADS UP FROM A FRIEND."
5,WOW!,"The meeting of Ronald Isley of the legendary Isley Brothers and producer/composer/arranger extraordinare Burt Bacharach seems odd at first. But their two different styles actually complement one another. Bacharach provides Isley with dreamy yet jazzy and soulful arrangements, while Isley sings the hell out of Bacharach's songs. Although songs such as ""Raindrops Keep Falling On My Head"", ""Alfie"", and ""The Look Of Love"" have been heard a million times, Isley and Bacharach treat them as if they were recorded for the first time. So kick off your shoes, pour the wine and be prepared to be startled by the collaboration of these two giants. Essential!!!"
2,same old maglight,maglites need to switch these s***ty bulbs to LED's i have a Streamlight 66122 Stylus Pro Penlight that no exaggeration is twice as bright and probably a fourth the size which is ridiculous this thing takes two d batteries and the output of light is a complete joke compared to my penlight that takes two aaa batteries ill never buy another flashlight without led's again they last longer are brighter dont drain batterys as fast and dont get hot like these bulbs do get it together maglite and switch to led's because eventually people will stop being blinded by a popular brand name and realize your bulbs suck and will move on.
3,"Saves space, if you only own 4 bottles.","This would be great for parents who own the regular sized bottles. I, on the other hand, use the Gerber Premium Comforthold bottles which are wide mouthed and have wide rings and nipples. They don't fit onto the rack very well AT ALL unless you cram them all in there, and then it takes longer to dry. I do like the fact that I don't have to dry my bottles on a towel on the counter, and I do like that the rack folds down for easy travel and storage, but for those who use wide-mouthed bottles I would recommend something else."
5,A Great Gift,"I have a friend who is obsessed with little Butters! This box is absolutely amazing, and really made her day. If you're looking for something unique to give, this would be it!"
4,It Works,I had read about Maca Pure in a consumers report. Both my wife and I tried this. We are in our mid 60's and our love life seemed to be waning. We bought Hot Plants for Him and Hot Plants for her. It defeinately makes a difference. I usually take 2 capsules and you can feel it working.We are going to continue using it.
3,Electric guitar capo,"This is a good capo for an electric guitar, it is not big enough for a full sized acoustic. If you are looking for a capo for an acoustic guitar, this is not the one for you."
3,Use with care,Has a fairly strong spring. It could easily snap violently out of your hand and damage your guitar.
4,Sub-Adequate- a bit outdated.,This was the first review book I purchased and have purchased additional resouces. No CD ROM (useful for taking CATs) and the tests in the back of each chapter are minimalistic. Some questions are still utilizing suggestions for treatement that aren't even on the market any more. Suggest looking elsewhere or get this along with other books.
2,I Expected More,I thought these sheets were great for the price until I washed them. After three washes they are pilling. I did not think sheets with this thread count would do that.
4,Soft and comfortable,"These sheets are very soft and comfortable, especially after washing. I have washed these several times, and they do not thin out with washing. They are definitely worth the money."
4,great beat and rithm,"this album evokes all the classical style of santa rosa, with some great dance songs and some ballads a must for any salsa fan."
2,Scratched!!!!,I just received these today and they are both scratched:( Not happy about this purchase. I was really looking forward to putting them on my new car.
4,Can't beat the money,"I bought this unit because I needed a phantom power unit for a condenser mic and I am amazed with the results. If you have a project studio, you will be too.I've used this preamp to add tube warmth, depth and responsiveness to vocals and acoustic guitar. There is no substitute for tubes. If you're a pro, you'll probably spend more money on something else. For the rest of us.. it's a huge step up in sound vs the solid state preamps in most interfaces."
4,HUMMMMMMMMMM - UPDATE!,"This has a frustrating hum when used as a microphone preamp. If you are expecting to use this to record vocals, caveat emptor.However, I've had better luck using this as a guitar preamp after removing the chinese 12AX7 tube and replacing it with a Grooves Tubes Gold. It is running into a cheap solid state practice amp and has vastly improved the sound. Crank both the knobs and you will get a nice tube saturation, albeit with a noticeable hum. For $30, this really improved the sound of my mediocre guitar amp.In short, change the tube and you might find some nice guitar tones."
4,Great value for the money!,"I picked this up at my local Guitar Center when I needed more preamps for my Scarlett 18i6. I'm really surprised at how good this sounds for $30. Granted, I'm far from a pro, but this gives me a great warm tone on an electric cello, which is exactly what I was looking for. If you're just starting out, it's REALLY hard to go wrong with the ART Tube MP. For me, it's just nice to have a preamp to transform my Scarlett's less-useful line inputs into (MUCH more useful) mic inputs. The slight tube warmth is just a nice bonus."
4,What on earth?,"What's going on? I just bought this book second-hand, and here I am on [...], reading more about child killer Mary Bell, and the similarities are almost word-for word! Amazon says this book was written by Ray Black, although the book doesn't actually claim an author, and the entry on Mary Bell on crimelibrary.com was written by Shirley Lynn Scott. Who plagirized who, though? This book was published in 2004, but I'm not sure when Shirley wrote her article on crime library."
4,Incredibly cute!,"This journal's appeal lies in its design - the cover that mimics an old library check-out card and the quotes about books that have been sprinkled throughout the pages. It contains sections for books you want to read, books you've lent out, etc, which are nice, but I wish they weren't so specifically labeled so the journal's use could be more flexible. I am using it to keep a record of books I have read per month, so I have appropriated some of the other sections for that purpose. One feature that I really like however, is the pocket to keep magazine clippings (about books of course!) in."
3,"Have to fiddle, but it works...","This two blade, adjustable circle hole cutter is not an expensive quality tool, and this is reflected in the price. I needed this to make some hobby parts; it took a few minutes of fiddling around with it to get it adjusted, but it seems to work fine after that. My suggestion is that after you get it adjusted, make extra pieces, so you won't have to go through the setup process again. Also need to be careful, its a big piece of spinning metal in the drill press, don't want to get your hand or clothing caught in this while its cutting!"
3,Been there done that,"Nothing new, to me anyway. Pictures were beautiful but to someone who hasn't done it before, the instructions aren't enough."
2,Six Pouches for only $4.79??,"So do you really get six pouches of this for the listed $4.79, or do you only get a single pouch? Normally the price would be around $5 per pouch which makes this listing appear to be a mistake.Giving low review because of confusion. Will adjust to five stars if this turns out to be true for this price."
2,Not impressed,"When I ordered my item it was immediately shipped the next day, which was impressive. However, when I received the product I was not impressed at all. The item I purchased was labelled as new, I have my doubts on this and suspect that it may have just been re-packaged. The disks had a number of scratches on most of them, it is unplayable. Even after purchasing items to repair the DVD's they still don't work. For the price I paid for this item, I am extremely unimpressed. The only good part of my order was that I received it in a timely manner."
5,Like coming home from school,"The collected edition exceeded my expectations! If your thinking ""Well, maybe I'll get it"" do yourself a favor, GET IT! To a true Batman fan who remembers coming home from school anxiously looking forward to the next episode, this is truly worth your money!"
5,At last!,"Incredibly comfortable, best ever! I'm 42C, small frame, and when I first looked at it in the package I thought it was huge. But it fits like a dream. The straps don't slip, the fabric is incredibly smooth and soft. I just wish I found this when there were more colors available, but I'll buy every beige one I can get find just so I never run out!"
4,Paula is Queen,Paula has changed my Yankee family's outlook on Southern cooking and they have finally come around to seeing it the way of this old KY boy. Her comfort food is so tasty and her recipes are so simple even the man in the house might enjoy them.
5,the very best of the best,"this cook book is not only very easy to follow but will make you look like a chef in no time. the recipes are wonderful , each one standing on it's own merits making it very hard to say which would be the very best in the book.. a great deal of love and time went into this book ..truely one book each person will wish to hand down for generations to come."
4,Southern Hospitality,"I recently saw Paula's show on the cooking channel. I really love her Southern charm and lack of pretense. The recipes in this book are simple and use ingredients you already have in your kitchen, which appeals to me. The book is in a binder so it stays open easily while you follow the recipe. Unfortunately, though I've made two recipes my extremely picky husband only liked one and be warned, these recipes are not for the weight conscious (sic). I will keep trying, though, as I'm sure most of them are wonderful."
4,It's Typical Paula Fare,"This book is full of recipes from Paula's show - which is a great time saver (and ink saver) if you're like me and print a lot of her recipes. This is typical Paula fare - southern cooking that is easy, tastes good, and relatively quick-cooking. It's comfort food. Her recipes are adaptable for a low-fat diet - I know because I do it. If you're the type that considers yourself too refined for this style of food or cooking, then this book is a waste of your time and money. If you're a laid-back person who likes food that is low on the fuss factor, uses ingredients that are easily accessible and don't cost a fortune, and typically taste great, this is a great addition to the collection!"
2,Recipes like your mom used to make . . .,". . . if your mom cooked for you in the '50 and '60s, as mine did. These recipes (and the cookbook format itself) all seem to be from another era, when we didn't worry about fat and were happy with fairly bland food.I had never heard of Paula Deen; I received the cookbook as a gift. I'll be donating or selling it somewhere -- I've just spent half an hour browsing it, and honestly have not found a single recipe I'd want to try. Many sound just like recipes from the Junior League cookbooks that I've owned for 25 years.If you want to try some ""old-fashioned home cookin',"" this may have some recipes you'll like. But if you've developed any kind of sophisticated tastes, I don't think this is a cookbook you'd enjoy."
5,Esoteric Historey Comes Alive,"The author has again succeeded in writing an epic novel that is at once both an exciting adventure story on a grand scale, as well as an unusually insightful teaching of high spiritual truths.The story is set in the early part of the 1900s and is simply engrossing. While reading, I found within the pages of this hard-to-put-down book many simple yet profound lessons on practical living, along with the examples of how others have dealt with their spiritual path.Esoteric history comes alive with vivid detail in this epic story, spanning countries and continents, and including secret teachers in India and magical espionage in Nazi Germany.In today's market of new-age authors clamoring for recognition, Bradley's books clearly stand above the many. I believe this book will become one of those long sought-after classics of metaphysical literature that are so rare, even in today's climate of increasing spiritual thought."
5,Exciting end-times information!,"I found this book very exciting! It talks about bible codes in end-times prophecy and gives a review of the book of Revelation, verse by verse. A must read for anyone interested in our future, and what signs of the times are here, and are to come!"
3,The Shadow of the Apocalypse.,The book is well written but there are few new details from other books on the market in print previously.
5,Works Great!,"I moved my speakers around, so needed a longer subwoofer cable after reading the reviews i decided to go with this. This works fine."
1,Overpriced cable.,"I worked for 4 different national electronics retailers, and I can honestly say that Monster cables are overpriced. 90% overpriced. Every year, they (monster) would have a contest where we could get all the Monster Products we could buy at 90% off, if we sold X amount of product. At 90% off, Monster still made money.For example, I purchased the top of the line Z series, and the picture quality WAS THE SAME AS THE PACK IN CABLES. No difference whatsoever.Only place where cables made a difference was with audio. Speaker cables definitely sound better when bigger.Oh, and the THX label means nothing, except more money for Monster. It's the SAME cable as the non-THX label. I've seen both cut in 1/2. They are identical."
4,Time Passages,"A great read for our long drive home from work. We get caught up in the characters' lives and situations thinking we have the mystery all worked out, but there's that subtle twist in the end. As with all of Tony Hillerman's novels, the background information of the Navajo way of life is interesting and obviously well-researched. Place names are familiar and detailed to give you a sense of the area. We enjoy these tapes very much."
4,My ex was in it!,"The movie itself is an okay movie, but watching my ex's brains get blown out of his head against a car window made the movie so much better...I am confused though, when we were together he didn't have a brain, so the movie was flattering him :)"
2,Not a very well organized book,"We needed this for a class, so I had no choice but to buy it. Each time I went to look something up, I felt that it took me an hour to find it. That said, it is an okay supplement to lectures."
1,Way below par,"As travel novels go, this was one of the worst I've read. The story line was predictable and boring with very little action to entertain the reader. After the first chapter I became bored with the constant inane dialogue from Johnny, the main character. I found Johnny a very irritating character, completely lacking in both culture and manners. Johnny spent most of his time forcing himself onto the local girls in the desperate hope that he could lure one into bed. The characters in general were unrealistic and readily divulged personal secrets to strangers. In reality it is very rare for anyone to tell a complete stranger such personal information.I found many errors e.g. street names in Dutch cities given fallacious names and basic typos such as one discovered by the first reviewer i.e. ""the music backend me"".I think that most readers will find this novel a terrible bore, therefore its better left on the shelf."
1,Basic College Mathematics,"The text itself was helpful; however, both my original purchase and it's replacement both had defective DVD's to accompany the text. I was very disappointed in this."
5,Good Job!,Good book with a prefect coverGood book with a prefect coverGood book with a prefect coverGood book with a prefect cover!
2,Very disappointed,I order with amazon for used textbooks as I am a student. This paticiular order I placed was the worst expierence I have had.I'm taking it as a lesson learned. Always have a tracking number available. Do not use buyers with Media Mail as no tracking numberis available.
2,Worth a look mostly because of the author,"It was Iceberg's last novel; apparently published posthumously. Seems to me to be in an extremely unfinished state; the dialogue is bizarre. Not bizarre in the ""ebonics"" manner that ""Pimp"" was in, but dialogue the likes of which nobody really speaks in. I can't tell if he wrote it out in what he considered educated english (in a way it is just that), or his idea was to write the story as a sketch wherin the protagonists have really pronounced argots; later changing it to be more realistic.While his classic ""Pimp"" wasn't exactly what you'd call a cheerful book, this one was positively bleak in its misanthropic outlook. As a novel, it is a complete failure, but the depths he plumbs in this one (exploring his misogyny via what is apparently the story of his childhood), and the fact that it is Iceberg Slim's work, make it worth a look."
4,surprisingly different,"some of the acting wasn't as sharp but over all a nice ""real life"" story. not a rehab of the usual Christmas stories. (and if your a Micheal Sweet fan, you'll get a nice surprise)"
1,SHOCK N' ME!,"u know if u could give negative stars then oh boy id have fun in this particular section...toby keith is cool..and is a very talented singer...but when u hear those troop songs..my god..it gets lame...u know the country is worried enough...dont u think its time to change the mood a bit? we're not ignorant either so its not like we're forgetting whats going on overseas...i guess to music like this we're portrayed or better yet ""AMERICANS"" (who ever they may be) are seen as rednecks...u know if he releases another cd just please man LEAVE THE TROOPS ALONE...maybe we shud blame this ""american"" president..cuz if the U.S was not overseas these songs would not be coming out..u dont have other genres of music releasing songs like this..good luck toby...still GOD BLESS THOSE TROOPS but GOD TOBY ENOUGH WITH THIS TROOP THING"
1,Bland and uninspring drivel,"I've had the displeasure of hearing ""Shock N Y'all"" (which is a very dumb title BTW) while sitting in my friends car. I do like country music and since it was the only CD in the car, i popped it in and checked it out. ""I Love This Bar"" has some of the dumbest lyrics I have ever heard, only a true redneck would enjoy this song. All the rest are pretty bland and boring. He trys to sound off being ""patriotic"" but you can't feel any emotion. Just sounds like he's trying to cash-in...If you want to hear some country that IS patriotic than listen to ""Ragged Old Flag"" by Johnny Cash."
4,Excellent album!,"In my opinion, this is Toby Keith's best cd yet! His great songwriting and singing ability is just outstanding and it shows it all on this wonderful cd. A must buy for any country music fan!"
3,"Not His Best, Granted!","I am a Toby Keith Fan. I love his music and have seen him three times in concert. I don't dislike this CD. I don't listen to it as much as I do some of this others either. He's a talented man. He's an awesome entertainer...bottomline. This CD has a couple of really good songs. Don't Leave, I Think I Love You is a cute song. His bus songs needed to be on the CD, and I know people don't necessarily agree with that. But I promise you they are a hit at his shows and people wanted to hear them here. I think that he gets a bad rap because of his ""outspoken attitude"". I'll play the CD for years to come, enjoying his talent, just not as much as the previous releases. It's worth the purchase, none the less."
1,One word: crap!,Just another example of what Nashville is trying to pass off as country music these days.
1,I Reckon This Blows,"Toby Keith is annoying. The music on here all sounds the same ""I'm a redneck american""."
1,Screw this stupid hick,"I would personally never listen to country which is the worst genre of music out there today. However, if someone wants to listen to songs about glorifying ignorance thats fine with me. But at least have the decency not to call your idiotic album after a military operation, thereby disrespecting the people of Iraq and the military personnel involved. This guy is the biggest hick on the planet and anyone who buys this cd needs to have their brain checked...thanks"
1,I'm shocked all right and disappointed.,"This album is not up to par. Love the first track but it goes down hill very quickly from there. One of the only catchy tunes other than ""I love this bar"" is ""If I were Jesus."" The lyrics however border on sacrilege. This CD was so unbearable, I gave it away because I knew I'd never listen to it. Toby needs to take note and slow down production of albums. He's been churning them out about 1 per year, and this one shows the stress."
1,Shocking,"Toby Keith shocks me by reaching all time lows in music quality. Not only is the music horrendous, but his message is one of hate, intolerance, and violence. The same conservatives who bash the tv for it's violence, embrace this truly evil man with a passion. Go listen to music with a positive message, such as anti-flag, thought riot, or minor threat. At least when you're sXe, you aren't smoking ""weed with willie""."
1,"Keep waving that flag, mouthbreather.","I used to like Toby Keith. Then I started walking upright.Actually, no, that's not even close to true. Even monkeys hate this guy. When fellow ""contemporary country"" (read: pop music for Nascar fans) musicians start complaining that this troll makes them look ""ignorant,"" that's truly an all-time low for the genre.Go buy something from Johnny Cash or Hank Williams Sr. if real country is your thing. Leave this album for those with a family tree resembling a telephone pole (you know who you are)."
3,Cringe,"""If I were Jesus"" and ""Weed with Willie"" just don't belong together on the same album. The first may be one of the most effectively religious popular songs ever sung and the second is a silly ""ditty"" accepting of illegal behavior. The juxtaposition of the two simply feels wrong. Not sure of how someone who appreciates the one can accept the other on the same album. Also, Ford ads in an album is a bad trend I'd like to see the last of."
1,Shock'n who?,"Not once was I shocked to hear the halfwit lyrics and 'bama redneck-esque tone of this album. I expected nothing less from TK. What DOES shock me is that people actually enjoy listening to this grimy scumbag.Do yourself a favor and listen to something a little less irritating, like fingernails on a chalkboard or a Shania Twain CD."
1,dont listen to the hype...this isnt country music,"listen up...this so called ""real nashville"" country, it's bs...toby keith is about as far away from being a country musician as britney spears is from being a rocker...do yourself a favor and instead of this corporate dribble get some steve earle or johnny cash or the new loretta lynn album...but pass on this, it's truly a piece of crapoh and the taliban song is one of the most offensive things i think i've ever heard...if there's ever a reason that the arab world hates us and thinks we're rude and ignorant, just read the lyrics to the taliban song"
1,Shocking,"Yeah there's never been music written about drinking and doing drugs before. Toby Keith sure is ""Shock'n""."
1,still blows,"Ha ha no PETA lover here, but this album still blows as it panders to illiterate rednecks who worship Fox News, oops, I mean to say, the salt of the Earth. You know, them good ol people, who dont really question things in life, the kind of folks who do what they are told.Steve Earle and Ryan Adams could write songs around the uber hick Keith and any of his buds any day of the week."
3,Not so good!,"I've been a Toby Keith fan for some time now, and i liked every album so far.But this album is a bit disappointing because the songs aren't that great and not as good as other ones.Some of the songs are simply not good, for example: 'If i was jesus' is certainly not good and almost crap.I like 'I love this Bar' and the rest not.there are a few good songs on this album, but i think there is better music around where you can spent your money on.Surely i hope that his next album will be much more better."
2,good record,"this is a good record that will have many singing along to the hits like i love this bar, but besides the 3 money songs the rest is dead air, but worth it if your a toby fan."
3,An interesting trip to nowhere,"The excesses of this book are excusable for a first novel. Still, I kept thinking as I read my way through Mona Simpson's Anywhere but Here, why didn't a good editor get ahold of it and shorten it by a third? There is so much repetition and so little movement or character development in this novel! I don't know why I found it so interesting, but I did. I stuck with it to the end. I felt like I was reading a good writer's journal. Ultimately, though, I think it fails as a novel, at least it did for me."
2,anywhere but here,"the book anywhere but here shows a mother who is capricious and unfulfilled trying to find a life for her daughter which she didn't have for herself. i found it confusing that the book jumped around and didn't have much of a plot. the boring unemotional character ann august who takes up much of the book keeps the book at an uneventful state, leaving you feeling like you don't want to finish the book. there were many parts that could have been left out and seemed unnecissary."
1,Interesting facts but no good for athletes,"This book I read whilst studying at college- I have a Msc in Sports and have been actively involved in track and field for years. This book however is trying too hard to be taken seriously as a major player in the Sports Science world. It flits from one subject to the other and goes into too much detail on trivial subjects which makes it hard to follow--My Lecturer used the book as a source of amusement -- I mean ""a shower is taken after every workout"" is hardly what you would expect to find when looking for meaningful subject matter!!!"
5,Our family loves this book!,"I was looking for a ""real"" Easter book for the kids. Found The Very First Easter by Paul L. Maier. I can't tell you how much my girls LOVE this book. The format is a Mom and Dad telling their son about Easter based on scripture. Both the writing and the illustrations are just excellent!!!"
5,Excellent Book,"This book has such beautiful illustrations. When I read it to my granddaugther she was captivated by it. I highly recommend this book for not just children, but for any age."
3,I'm Also Disappointed,"The pictures are spectacular. If you're good at story telling, buy this book and tell the story in your own words. I thought the story itself was patronizing, and there were too many words on each page to hold the interest of a younger child. My four-year-old granddaughter LOVES books, and will sit still for quite a long time, but she was fidgety and lost interest in this one. I was sorry I'd bought it, and wished I'd chosen something more appropriate for her age."
5,Very Pleased,I was very pleased with my purchase of this DVD. Very professionally done and covered the information I was looking for. I will be looking at all the titles available by this same company.
3,An OK Ministry Album,"While not a big fan of the so-called death metal genre, I picked up this CD by the recommendation from a friend. I believe it has potential, but my personal tastes lie more towards rock and industrial music a la Gravity Kills, older Stabbing Westward and Nine Inch Nails.Most of the music on the cd seems to me fairly uninspired though I have been called wrong about it many times. The gem of the album by far is 'Burning Inside' which, if played alone, would get a cool 5-star rating.If you enjoy hearing older industrial or hard rock sounds like the Sex Pistols or early Fear Factory then I would suggest this CD. I do not think it caters to many audiences though, myself included.-Zilean"
1,Japanese 01,"This is a pared down version, and the DVD is full of ads for the full version. There are no comprehensible instructions, and the lessons are confusing. I just went in loops, with the same words being thrown at me over and over and then warnings that I had not completed the full lesson. One module said there were 16 words, but in a half hour I could only make four come up. Whew!"
4,SOOO much better than polishing by hand!!!,"This stuff is great. I polished a silverplated tea service with no trouble at all. There are a couple of TINY areas where the tarnish did not go away, but for the most part, the set looks like new! I couldn't get it anywhere near this shiny polishing by hand. The silver must be COVERED by BOILING water. It didn't do much at first. When I jiggled the sachet with the end of wooden spoon, the powder really started to dissolve in the water and it worked like magic. I love this stuff!"
4,A Good Thing,"John Payne may not have been in the original lineup, but he fronted the band for a very long time, giving it his full commitment. A release like this is a good thing because it shows how much life he breathed into a band that had already imploded for a number of reasons. Good for him! He's a very talented fellow who deserves much success in his new endeavors. I'm more interested in THIS group than in the reunion of the original crew."
5,Better than expected,BLU RAY quality was spot-on. The editing and filming was very good. i was impressed by the quality of their voices 30 years after they scored their first hit. Christopher Cross was a perfect guest. The sound quality was excellent.
3,music,"I enjoyed watching & listening to it- a good ""re-learning experience"" ! If you listen to what some would call ""different stuff"" - you might learn & enjoy some difference!"
1,Won't play,"I just received this DVD. It won't play in any of my 3 DVD set ups. The opening comes on with audio and video but once the band starts playing, there is no audio. There is also no audio tab on here so I can't even play with the settings to see if it would work. Because it was so cheap, I will just bite the cost and throw it out. If anyone had an audio problem with their copy and figured out how to correct it, please let me know!"
3,"Good idea, good attempt. Bad tech editors and reviewers.","I wouldn't recommend this book to novice network wizards. But for those who can see and identify errors, lets just consider this book as a tech quiz, a la ""find and fix"". It's been fun for me. Come on... It's impossible to know everything. Don't blame author. He has done a good work. He just didn't have a good support team. Yes, errors, yes, typos, and triple yes overall weight of all discrepancies almost ruin all other good impressions. But still, there are a lot of great and cool tips and tricks I have found.Hope there will be another edition."
2,Only bought it for Kelly and now I know why,"I bought the cd mostly for Kelly's songs, however, Tamyra and Justin did very well also. I wasn't too impressed with the rest I thought they could've done better. Clay was good,but would be better if he didn't over pronunciate so much. So all in all Kelly's tracks of OHN and MGUCL were by far my favorite. I've listened to the cd once or twice and I've listened to Kelly's bonus disc about 100 times. Thank God they decided to add her in there or else it would've been one less copy sold."
1,Not worth the money,"Totally not worth the money.Not Clay's best.Kelly's rendition of OHN is horrific.I reccomend Celine Dion's 1998 Christmas or WHITNEY HOUSTON's new ""One Wish: The Holiday Album"""
1,Now they have to ruin Xmas too??,"Oh man! Just when you thought they couldn't squeeze anymore drivel out of these losers, we are now subjected to an American idol Christmas. I can only imagine what the holidays would be like with this collection of freaks. Santa would be upset cause Reuben ate all the cookies...not to mention that Christmas ham, stuffing, yams, pies, green beans, rolls and even cranberry sauce! The Queen of Uncool (Kelly Clarkson) would just sit around with a scarf on moaning about we have lost touch with the holiday spirit and then make sure everyone knew she was the first Idol. Later, the Christmas Queen herself, Clay Aiken, would descend the staircase in a long flowing silver gown with missletoe attached to his tiara trying to hunt down Josh Gracin for a Xmas kiss. I have no idea what Justin Guiarini would be doing, Xmas troll perhaps???"
3,not much money put into this one,I absolutely love American Idol. But that's not a reason to go out and buy this album. Sounds like they are singing to karaoke accompaniment. It's like the record company tried to put this out there for us to buy without spending the time needed to polish the product. It's very poorly produced. There are a few good moments on the album though.
2,Oversung and Overproduced.,"This has to be one of the worst Christmas CD's ever produced. The white people seem out of place amongst of R&B-wannabe vocalists. The only decent singers on here are Kimberly Locke and Justin Guarini. Theh rest oversing their hearts out. Get Toni Braxton's ""Snowflakes"" or Mariah Carey's ""Merry Christmas"" instead if you want a good R&B/Gospel Xmas CD."
4,Overall worth buying!!!,"I love Christmas music and this CD does not disappoint. I love the ensemble of O Come, All Ye Faithful and Santa Claus is Coming To Town. Clay's sings the heck out of The First Noel!! Ruben gives a excellent rendition of This Christmas and Kelly gives a unique version of Oh Holy Night (not as good as Celine, but who can be?) This CD is a perfect addition to any Christmas collection."
2,2 Stars for Two Great Singers,"Justin Guarini and Kelly Clarkson clearly demonstrate the difference in talent between Season 1 and Season 2 of American Idol. On one hand we have Clay Aiken with his absolutely annoying over-enunciation and mediocre voice, and on the other hand we have the beautiful performances of Justin Guarini and Kelly Clarkson that showcase two wonderful singers who can actually put feeling into their music.Make a Christmas CD with real talents next time- Just Justin and Kelly."
1,does not fit,Even though this product is advertised as fitting broan model 655/659 heater/fanlight and model 657 fan light it does NOT fit. I would advise anyone seeking a replacemnt lense not to purchase this one.
4,Disturbing,"Although history is replete with Crusades, Jihads, Holy Wars, etc. it still stymies me how, otherwise intelligent people can slaughter each other and bring chaos to thousands, over religion. Even if any of it were true, it would seem sane to avoid it simply because it is so divisive, violent and irrational."
1,Misses the Mark,"Focusing on so-called ""religious"" violence is a bit off the mark in the twenty-first century. In the past 100 years, Atheist/Darwinist/Socialist/Humanist political pogroms have produced more corpses than all of the so-called ""religious wars"" of all previous centuries combined."
4,Terror In The Mind Of God,Excellent subject matter and covers a very broad range of groups. The book is too short for the intended scope. I would like to see a book of at least this length on each of the covered groups. I think theat the author's approach was well thought out. Seldom does anyone analyze terrorist groups from the psychological and cultural perspective. This is a very valuable addition to any library on terrorism. The research is thorough and well documented. I have spent a fair amount of time acquiring his resource material. Good job.
1,Total Ripoff!,The DRM copy protection crap is so extreme on this thing that it simply doesn't work 99% of the time. I really like the concept and the program but it just won't work most of the time....so screw it.
5,Great,"I'm a welder and i use this to change weld tips and cut Mig wire. The side cutters are great, they cut the wire clean and doesn't smash it"
3,Not so sure,"I just started taking these pills a week ago. They seem to help a little bit, I hope with further use my skin will really improve. The only thing bad about these pills is that they have a bad after taste."
5,Go,"Intelligently written music and lyrics, with moving ballads and some great ""rock-out"" songs as well. This CD was a follow-up to the successful ""Everything You Want"" and is actually, song-for-song, an even better CD. It's too bad Vertical Horizon is not as well known or as successful, because they write and perform great music."
4,What a PLOTZ!,"Dude, this album comes right out of the gate and blows a vanna! But it makes up for it by the end, and just when you think these guys almost zonked, the whole thing comes together. Track 7 sounds like a bloads to me, but what the hey, I've been tone deaf ever since I had the Sour Mash at Dylan's. Rock on fellars! Grover"
2,So So,"This album is by no means bad; songs are well crafted, melodic, and have plenty of hook. However, it is clear that apart from some strings and the occasional hypnotic loop, VH has not progressed from EYW. This albums just isn't all that interesting. By all means, buy it, burn it, whatever and enjoy the hooks now, but realize you probably won't be popping this disc in much once you've worn it through. I second the suggestions to buy Live Stages, that is truly VH's peak."
1,Am I listening to the same cd?,"How can everyone have liked this cd? Three-word lines with third-grade rhymes, accompanied by the same canned music you've heard on every other song on the radio. ""Cannot hide/this emptiness inside""? Cuts like a knife, that one does. Go back and listen to ""Liberty"" or even ""You're a God"" (two great songs from completely different eras) and then try to listen to this flotsam with a straight face. I'm a longtime fan, but a band only gets one more chance after turning out a cd like this."
4,i bought this CD for one song,"Won't Go Away gota be VH best song ever, way better than Everything You Want. I've been listen to this one non-stop ever since I heard it for the first time."
3,Not bad just formulatic; The old Vertical Horizon is dead.,"I loved, I repeat, Loved Running on Ice! This was VH at it's best. They had their unique sound and style and highlighted Keith Kane's vocals more. Also, Running on Ice did not have the formula sound and it set apart VH as it's own band.Here comes GO, a very formulatic CD. Not awful, not bad but it is not much different than the standard formula based music. There is no more ""Falling Down"" or ""Fragments"" type songs. The CD was obviously produced to meet the record labels definition of formula. I am certain this was the reason for the delay. Don't get me wrong, I still like GO, it just feels sad that the real Vertical Horizon (Running on Ice, Live Stages) is gone and may never return. Maybe hitting it big isn't such a good thingfor the listener."
2,My Westinghouse is dying........,"I bought my westinghouse 32"" television 9/07 and about a week ago(5/09) my television would work fine for about an hour of continuous use and the picture would get very distorted and really fuzzy to the point where you can't see picture anymore. It has gone from about an hour of continuous use to about 15 minutes before the picture starts messing up. It's weird cuz if i turn off the tv for a while and turn it back on the picture will be fine and then after about 15 minutes it will mess up again. This television was excellent before it started dying on me. Please don't buy this television, spending the extra couple hundred dollars for a good name brand tv would be worth it."
1,Don't bother with this tv,"I bought this tv just over a year ago and the picture is now scrambling. This of course happened after the warranty ran out. I contacted Westinghouse customer service and they said to unplug and then plug the tv back in to see if that helped, it did for a day or two. Now I only get a scrambled picture. Westinghouse only has one review on its website and it is of course positive and from a tech review website and no way for consumers to add their own reviews. I'll be checking amazon for reviews before I consider another appliance purchase. I won't be buying another Westinghouse product and I don't suggest you do either."
1,Canadian Sony BD Players Cannot Play This BD,"I have a Sony BDP-S570 and it will not play this BD, though I can play it on one of my computers with a BD burner, using Cyberlink PowerDVD10. I contacted Sony Canada and they did some research for me. Turns out this BD is in 1080i50 format and Canadian Sony players do not support that format (they like 1080i60). I was told that Sony had no plans to market a compatible player in Canada in the future. So be warned: if you have a Canadian, and I suspect, US Sony BD player, you will not be watching this BD on your widescreen television, except via computer linkup, if your computer is capable. My laptop, with a BD reader, wouldn't touch this BD either. I suspect that is because there is an older, stripped-down version of PowerDVD on the laptop.I have watched a couple of episodes on my main computer. Not all that impressed. Not much plot and lots of gratuitous sex and violence."
5,One of the Best Translations,"This is one of the best translations of the Song of God that I have ever come across. Swami Nikhilananda is the translator -- the actual commentary is taken from Sankaracharya's famous writings. However, as this book was translated as a Ramakrishna monk and uses Adi Sankara's commentary, the emphasis is on radical dualism. The other schools of thought are mentioned in the intorduction (Ramanuja;s qualified non-dualism and Maadhva's dualism), but they are not emphasised. This does give the work a bias, as the Geetaa over and over seems to waver back and forth between the monistic ideals (similar to other Upanishads) and the dualism that is common in much of Hinduism today. Also, a big plus is a summary of the Mahaabhaarata that allows the reader to make a little bit more sense of the battle itself and the goings on in the first chapter. A very good resource for those interested in the advaitic approach."
1,NOT a Lamp - only a lampSHADE!,"This product is advertised as a lamp. It is NOT a lamp. It is only a lampshade. When it arrives, it doesn't come with any hardware or instructions, so you don't know what hardware to buy so you can actually use it, much less how to attach it to any hardware. Waste of money and way more trouble than it's worth."
2,You can easily find a better book than this.,There are some mildly amusing concepts in this book - but to have to wade through dull writing to find them is just no fun. Mr. Lee's done better before.I couldn't even finish the book - I mean there's too many books better than this to waste time on it - and I love the horror genre. But I like good writing even better.Maybe you're better off with one of Mr. Lee's more explicit novels if you're into that.
1,THIS GOT PUBLISHED?,"If you like stories that have no character develeopment and little to no plot, by all means pick this up.Reading the back of this cover it would seem that this would be a great read. A girl descends into Hell to save her sister who has committed suiced. While she is there she learns that Hell has become a city of huge porportions with streets, bars, and restaurants. Throw in an angel who is sorry he ever joined Lucifer to fight against God and now wants to make good. He has an army and with the help of the sister he is going to over throw Satan.But when you read it you will realize what horrible stuff this is. It is written on a fifth grade level. maybe it took me an hour to read this. An hour I wish I had back to do something else,like watching paint dry. I should have realized this book was going to be bad, when I realized this is the same guy who wrote the Big Head(see my review of that one).If you like this kind of thing stick with King and Barker."
2,quality of black holes gopher trap,yes these traps work and yes I've caught several gophers. The problem is the quality. I purchased these 8 to 12 weeks ago and the springs have now punched out the back. 1 trap is no longer useable. ***disappointing****
3,black hole gopher trap,It's not the best. I've caught two gophers in two weeks. I have to admit that it's the only trap of three that I purchased that caught any gophers.
3,Mixed feelings.,"I've had this wrist pad for about 3 months. It is extremely comfortable and has completely eliminated some mild discomfort in my mouse hand that had developed before I started using it.The trouble is, I'm experiencing the same problem as the previous reviewer. After three months of frequent (but non-abusive) use, the seams are separating exposing the internal gel. The stuff is sticky and is hard to get off the desk.I love the pad when it's in one piece, but it doesn't have much of a shelf life."
2,"Works great, but poor seams do not last","Does exactly what I wanted, but product's construction is not up to the level required to survive an elbow's weight (as I use it). Maybe it would last longer if you keep your weight off if it and just have a light wrist resting on it (careful to not lean with weight on it). I tried re-gluing with various good flexible glues but the rubber base (similar to wet-suit rubber) seems hard to match with a good adhesive - I suspect this is the problem with the original seal as well. I had the same problem with an second-hand keyboard wrist rest of the same design (assume it was Belkin as well). Now I am going to try one of the ""solid clear"" designs to see how they stand up (non Belkin)."
1,"It was comfortable, but it didn't last","I purchased this because I need a comfortable rest for use with my USB trackball. The Belkin WaveRest was comfortable, but after two weeks of daily use I noticed gel coming out of it. It was a waste of money. Too bad, because I was starting to like it."
4,Works fine,"Wowee some people are mighty picky for something that costs $4.00 (or maybe they paid more?) I bought it because I like the designs on other flat mousepads but still wanted wrist support. At this price you can't beat it. I haven't had issues with seams coming apart etc. (Are they using this as a frisbee? lol) Comfortable, works just fine."
2,OK if you don't mind replacing it every couple of months,I bought the Belkin F8E244-BLK WaveRest Gel Wrist Pad about two months ago to supplement another Belkin wrist pad I bought over 10 years ago. The 10-year old one still does it's job and is still in one-piece -- the new one fell apart after about 8 weeks of normal use. The gel gets all over the desk and is very sticky. I've got mine in a small zip-lock bag until I can find a new brand of a better quality.
3,It Gets Stinky,"Full disclosure: I used this item with my LEFT wrist over the keyboard. Not exactly it's intended use, and I was probably putting more consistent pressure on it than if I'd used it with a mouse.I had no problems with leakage, and I used this wrist rest for over a year.The problem I DID have, however, was sweat and whatnot in the fabric which made it start to smell not unlike an unwashed pillowcase. It wasn't overpowering or even likely noticeable to anyone but me.But fabric on a wrist rest is a bad idea."
3,the series is making a comeback,"I agree with a previous reviewer. This one improved on the last few books in the series but it's still not as good as the early ones. The editing improved a bit. Some of the action was implausible in real life but didn't detract from the story. The submarine was a scene stealer and made it exciting.The thing that disturbs me most is that the author barely mentioned an important recurring character at the beginning of book 16, killed the character off at the end of book 17 after not being mentioned anywhere else in the story, and then in books 18 and 19 acted as if the character disappeared in book 16 not 17. He's writing the books so fast he can't even keep track of his own characters."
5,Drug runners have never looked this good.,"This novel starts off at a blistering pace and doesn't slack off. This is a must read, and should be required in schools to educate the youths of today on what goes on in the real world."
3,Content customer,"I feel that in the first chapter or so, the author makes comparisons and uses terms that were a bit confusing and hard to follow at times. It almost turned me off from wanting to continue reading the book, but after you get past that, the book is an interesting read. It gives you a little chemistry lesson along with some history lessons. All-in-all, I would say the book was decent. It's not something I would just pick up as something that peeks my interest but it was decent nonetheless."
5,Best beginner book out there,"This book is an excellent starting point for the person who is interested in learning about numerology, but has no background knowledge on the subject. It comes with charts that make things so much easier, as you can just ""fill in"" the necessary numbers, letters, calculations, etc. While the book is short and sweet, it covers many aspects of numerology, from your birthpath number, down to Karmic lessons, pinnacles and challenges. It reawakened my interest in numerology, and after reading this and studying with a few more books, I am now able to offer numerology reports in my professional readings."
4,Destination anywhere,"Seems the story was a bit forced to track with the album. But, I enjoyed seeing some of his old costars like Annabella Sciorra, who I thought was a perfect match for JBJ in Little City. Also, the scene in the cab with Whoopie Goldberg was fun. Very depressing overall."
3,Dated,A bit dated and a little too detailed about marketing techniques. Written in 2007 or 2008 it's already obsolete ? Would like a newer edition with updates on election of 2008
1,FANTASTIC FEEL GOOD BOOK,"AFTER HEARING HIM ON A LOCAL RADIO STATION, I DECIDED TO PURCHASE HIS BOOK. IT WAS A GREAT INSPIRATION TO ME AND I REALLY BENIFITED FROM THE BOOK AND HIS IDEAS. AFTER READING IT, I FELT I REALLY UNDERSTOOD THE AFTERLIFE IN A MORE SIMPLE WAY. I HAVE PURCHASE THE BOOK AND GIVEN IT TO SEVERAL FAMILY MEMBERS AND FRIENDS."
4,Genuine story,"Really enjoyed this book. Lots of books like this around but this book was touching, easy to follow and not over the top. Patrick's story is genuine and gives comfort."
5,classic,Blast from the past- Hugh O'Brien was fantastic as Earp.Worth the money to bring back some good TV
1,The Ghostway,I prefer hearing unabridged versions of Mr. Hillerman's stories. This abridgment of The Ghostway was particularly awkward because it was transitioning between LA and the Four Corners and it did not work well. What in the heck was Jim Chee doing in LA anyhow?
3,"Enjoyable, but Somewhat Uninvolved","It was a long wait for this second book in the Crown Family series, and the wait turns out to be somewhat unrewarded. ""American Dreams"" is half as long as the first book, ""Homeland"", and it covers a few more years than ""Homeland"". It makes for a much faster read, but it is also somewhat dissapointing; instead of the great plot and character development that made ""Homeland"" an overwhelming and beautiful masterpiece, ""American Dreams"" proceeds briskly, sketching out the various plot lines without ever getting too involved. Still, Jakes is a masterful writer, and in the last hundred pages Jakes really connects with the story, bringing WWI vividly to life and creating an undeniable emotional effect. If only the rest of the book had this same power, ""American Dreams"", which is an enjoyable read, could have been another fine novel in the model of ""Homeland""."
3,"good, but...","I loved Homeland and was waiting with bated breath for American Dreams. However, after reading it, I was slightly dissappointed. Fritzi was a good main character, I guess I was just expecting more on the ""family"" front. The scope & intensity of Homeland just wasn't there in my opinion. It was still a good book, I was just hoping for more."
4,The Crown family story continues........,"I have read almost all of the John Jake books,including the Kent family chronicles. ""American Dreams"" continues the story of the Crown family into the 1900's and thanks to Mr.Jakes storytelling skills the story continues to fascinate and intrigue me, while I learn even more about the early history of this country. This story takes place primarily in the Detroit Michigan area and since I live 30 miles north of Detroit it's fun to see the streets and places I know so well inter-twined into the tale. Enjoyed it very much and will send for more."
2,Weak,"This one is certainly not as good as the previous novel in the series, Homeland. The plot is weak and highly reminiscent of Homeland (the tensed relation between the general and Fritzi, Carl wishes to marry Tess but she marries someone her father has choosen for her). There is little surprise in all of this.Furthermore, Fritzi is not a very compelling character, she's like a drifting boat with little power over the direction she takes. All the while she will be a reluctant star. Carl is much more interesting, but is given very little show time as Jakes centers whatever plot there is around Fritzi. There is also a lot of name-dropping (much of it useless), and it gets boring after a time."
2,Sorry....,"I read this whole book because it bore John Jakes' name on the cover, but I must admit it was a bitter disappointment. It was a fast- very fast- read but equally as disappointing. Homeland was excellent, magnificent...but this was a very big let-down with relation to its predecessor. Let's hope book three doesn't slump any further."
1,bad quality and can injure you,These are poor quality. I can't even use them to cut the crab shell. The handle is made so that it is very easy to pinch the inside of your hand (and it still doesn't cut the shell). I have already gotten a couple blood blisters from them. I chose to toss them over injuring myself. Expensive mistake.
3,Not nearly his best work,"I have read all of Quinn's fiction titles and the Holy certainly is not on par with the rest of his books. It is a good story and worth the read but not nearly as revolutionary as The Story of B. He makes several subtle points in the Holy that are intriguing, but primarily this book is something to read if you are just looking to enjoy a good story. For many people that is enough, and this book may work for such people. Yes, the book gives you a good deal to think about, but really not much new if you have read the bulk of his other titles. If you are new to Quinn I recommend reading the Story of B first. It is his best title in my opinion, and better done than Ishmael (although Ishmael is damn good). And clearly, you do not have to read Ishmael first to Understand B. The story of B can stand on its own."
3,DECENT ONE,"If you are looking for a Stephen King like book, don't waste your time. But if you are looking for philosophical approaches just buy it. You won't regret it."
3,The book is fascinating. This particular version of it is a pirate.,"Please rather purchase the slightly more expensive version published by Cleis Press, so that the revenue goes to the author and publisher rather than some criminal with a scanner."
5,Monroe Strut from Just Suspension,"This was a Monroe-Matic strut so of course it was a perfect fit and very high quality. Just Suspension had the best prices (better than direct from Amazon) and their standard shipment was real fast. [Be careful, if you use the menu-driven search to verify that the part will fit your car, it automatically switches you back to the higher-priced item direct from Amazon]. I also purchased the matching strut boots but didn't purchase the matching spring isolators, which was a mistake. I didn't think that I would need them, however once I took things apart the I found that the isolators were in very bad condition and were tough to reuse, but I couldn't afford to wait to order new ones. Next time I'll know better."
2,Not worth the purchase,"There are better books about the inner workings of Southwest out there. This book is light in new information. Perhaps page count isn't the best way to judge a book but this book is thin, the font is big and spacing generous. It's like a high school paper where the student played with the format tools in order to meet the required page count.It reads as if this is more of a summary of a presentation the author was giving about her experience at Southwest. Every Southwest employee I've talked too shares equal stories of their experience. Her's don't tell the story any better. I'd say skip it and stick with Nuts."
5,A great read.,"So happy to be able to down loan this book. It helped with my research paper. Btw, got an ""A""!"
3,fair read,"This is quick two day read for those who have some spare time on their hands. It does not prompt any changes in thinking or raise any critical questions but serves as a straightforward but in-depth view into the subjective world of college admissions.No book should ever serve as the sole reasoning behind college decisions but only as a complement to logical thinking, supportive parents, and a well-advised high school counselor. But if you find yourself in the crazy world of college admissions and want to read something helpful about the admission process, then pick this up - but don't expect too much."
1,MADE CHEAP,I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED IN THE QUALITY OF THIS OUTFIT. IT WAS A CUTE COSTUME BUT DID NOT HOLD UP AT ALL. AFTER THE EVENING WAS OVER THE SHOULDERS HAD RIPPED ON BOTH SIDES. THERE WAS NO HEMMING ON ANY OF THE COSTUME! WOULD NOT BUY AGAIN!!!!
1,Misleading title,"I ordered this tape thinking I would see an informative video on Disney World, the sights I should visit, the things I shouldn""t miss while I was there, instead I saw how they takwe care of their garbage, plant their flowers, reuse their water and a lot of dead space on the tape. This is an Eco tape which they do not tell you by the name. Would not recommend. I was very disappointed when I received this."
1,Also mislead,This video really has nothing to do about Walt Disney World -- waste of money & time. Should not even get the one star! Home & Garden Show on cable was much more informative on this topic.
4,nice,Received it today and was surprised how much detail could go into something so small. I can't wait to give this to my mom for Christmas.
3,Bodice Ripping Old School Historical.....,"this Victorian Historical Romance, written in 1996, was in the old school vein of flighty, big time ""too stupid to live"" heroines, mega alpha male heroes, and various and sundry highly implausible secrets, adventures and downright silly storylines- satanic cults anyone?All that being said-if you are feeling nostalgic for a classic ""bodice ripper"" then look no further. Ironically, this book reminded me of the Mexican Soap Opera always being parodied on Ugly Betty. Screaming, fainting, fighting, kidnapping and actual bodice ripping are contained in this 375 page tome. Sometimes bad is a good thing:)3.5 stars."
4,This book was exciting and hard to put down.,"I found Skylar Conner quite interesting and the story about her past was very original. Hawke was an interesting character as well and I liked the way he was trapped between the two worlds. I didn't like the characters interactions with the Souix people and culture though, I found it fake and unconvicing, But all in all I found the book entertaining and fun to read. Good Job Shannon Drake!!"
2,A little disappointed,"My husband bought this book and its companion, If He Only Knew, since we need to work on strengthening our marriange. I was glad that he took the initiative and was eager to read the book, but I found myself a bit disappointed by the content. While the basic concepts seem good, I found the examples and suggestions to be rather outdated. It was originally published in 1979, and, despite some revisions, seems to belong to a different time -- that of 25 years ago. The book seems to lean too much toward the idea of the wife being submissive to her husband, and encourages her to look nice and greet him with a smile when he comes home from work, which sounds very much like the Home Economics textbooks from the 1950s. I feel that the author's suggestions do not really speak to me in today's world."
3,It helped me to present issues that I needed to discuss,"I found that this helped me to communicate my needs, concerns and desires in a way that got my husband's attention. I always felt like a nag and was usually unsucessful in my attempts to communitcate effectively. This book showed me how to improve my technique."
4,Alleviating critics,"One of the few graceful big pressure indie sophomores that felt slightly compromised from one perspective, but enhanced in the next. The kind of follow up that does refine some of the grittier urgencies which made the debut stick out but in trade gets expansive production and refined compositions. Unfortunately it could have even been better had they spent the time end it properly, and by that I mean it was too short only just over a half hour with the wrong closer."
5,great album,"i think this album is great, on a par with is this it?, which i love. its only similar to the 1st album because its the SAME BAND! there not gonna suddenly turn into led zep or the clash. theres loads of great guitar work, catchy riffs and solos but nothing that says ""look at me, i can play guitar this fast"" it just fits the songs. i think casablancas' voice is great and goes well with the music, yeah its a laid back style, but theres a desperation in his voice u cant ignore. good music is just that regardless of their personal background, so dont knock em coz someone says there poor little rich kids. why does that even come into it? the strokes are great*****"
3,Over all good record,"I think this is a good record and much better than any other main stream crap on FM radio. The first track ""12:51"" is pretty lame. It's a poor excuse of a Cars' rip off and sounds even more so like some of their lesser known NY contemporaries.The second track ""reptilia"" is where it kicks in. Valensi & Hammond shine on this tune. The rest of the record flows pretty well with notable homage's throughout. Seems like these guys could do whatever they want and people would buy into it regardless. They could release an album of Buddhist chants and it would be hailed. In between dating super models, actresses, gracing every magazine cover in the world and vacationing in Hawaii they managed to write a few new tunes that are actually pretty good.Worth buying used but not at the $17 club price."
2,i hope this is it,other than Reptillia and 12:51 this CD basically sucks. The two mentioned songs kick ass but the rest of this album deserves to be burnt then burried and then dug back up to burn again. I would not recomend waisting money on this CD. Besides even if you like it the whole damn CD last only about 30 minutes so you don't even get time to savior it.
5,Has Not Left My CD Player,"Just saw them twice in NY, one at a ""secret show"" I won tickets to. Bowery Ballroom, only a couple hundred people. Amazing. So much better than at MSG. And this cd is ridiculously addicting. Reptilia, Under Control...I hum them all day long, wake up looking forward to hearing them again. Too cool. Too good."
4,Brilliant but flawed,"More of the same from the strokes, but who said that was a bad thing? The only problem with the strokes is that while every song on this album is strong, they all tend to blend in with each other."
2,Suicide,"Just imagine this..If the lead singer were to kill himself he'd be held up on high as the second (third, fourth, fifth?)coming of God, just like Kurdt Cobain was. Kurdt brought Punk back??? Yeah sure... The Strokes brought RNR back??? Yeah sure...Just give then time and they will be forgotten, that is if there's no suicide..."
4,The Strokes-Room on Fire CD Review,Room on Fire is pretty good Alternative Christian Rock. It's a good CD and plays well at home and in the car. I listen to it fairly often.
2,Tanto tiempo para esto........?,"Realmente que existe mucha decepción debido a la falta de imaginacion de esta banda que probablemente se sobrevaloro con el primer album que ralmente tiene como 3 o 4 temas muy buenos y los demas aceptables...... para haber sido el debut me parecio buen disco pero no a niveles a los cuales se les llevo. Actualmente existe una carestia de nuevos talentos que propongan algo nuevo o por lo menos que reinventen algo la verdad que este segundo disco no me parece que haya tenido algun sentido de salir a la venta, pareciera como que son los materiales ineditos que tenian reservados.....en fin. Y para esto se tardaron tanto en editar un disco ? realmente que sera la ultima vez que considere a este grupo>"
3,a spark for the strokes,"I really don't get the referances to Television or the Velvet Underground, they (Strokes) just sound a bit juvenile to me aiming to appeal to the american eagle crowd. Jet and Franz Ferdinad are a better buy. Most of the album is filler, except the track that sounds like a Cars rip off."
3,Nice...,I got nothing against the strokes. However if you're not paying close enough attention their albums tend to blur into one big song. Room on Fire is a good collection of songs but as an album it gets a little sterile. I hope the new album is a little more experimental.
5,This CD is awesome...,"But it only offers a limited number of listens at one sitting because the style of all the songs are the same. i guess thats how all albums are. but other than that, this is their best album. its reallygood, and neone who is looking for a good new source for oldern style of music from the late 70s and 80s, this is the one to get. really good music"
1,Just go away.,"I admit it. I began to buy into the media hype (Rolling Stone, Time Magazine, etc, etc) that these guys were going to save Rock and Roll. One of the last ""real"" bands. Well, if these guys are Rock's saviours then please, let it die and I'll just listen to the old good stuff. This album is a bore with a capital B. The lyrics aren't smart, the musicianship is good, not great and the singer, well I guess he tries too hard. Their swagger seems concocted (no new incarnation of the Stones or even Oasis here). I can't even imagine how boring these guys must be live. Please, don't buy this CD and maybe the Strokes will have the good taste to just go away."
1,This Band is a Music Media Scam Joke!,"Well, started out listening to their ultra-boring ""12:51"" track. Ugggh, this is all they have to offer after 2 years of their overhyped debut album? When I hear ""12:51,"" I ask ""Is This It?"" The song starts out with notes that sound like ""Chopsticks"" on the piano. And the guitar is just plain repetitive and boring. Saw these guys on the cover of Rolling Stone this month (10/03). They have absolutely no presence of true musicians. They appear to be a bunch of preppy college guys who have had fashion makeovers in attempt to make them look like music heads. Well, this music fan is not fooled! We have reached a very sad period in music history -- the Musical Ice Age."
2,Blah Blah Blah,"So I bought ""Room On Fire"" the day it came out (actually the day before; those pesky independent record stores), threw it in my car CD played, and listened. It seemed fine and dandy, much like a continuation of ""Is This It?"" with well-written songs and Television-like guitars. I decided I'd have to listen to it a few more times before really passing judgement.But you know what?... IT'S BEEN A MONTH-AND-A-HALF AND I HAVEN'T FELT THE URGE TO LISTEN TO IT AGAIN!! So I guess that's my final judgement; it's a pretty ""blah"" album so to speak. I don't dislike it, I'm just really apathetic towards it.The Strokes haven't failed or put out a horrible album with ""Room On Fire,"" but they've defined the term ""holding pattern."" If you need to feed your rock and roll mojo for 2003, I would like to direct you to Guided By Voices new disc ""Eathquake Glue."" It's everything that you want the Strokes to be (that goes for GBV's live act too)."
3,The - more fuzzy/muted vocals???,"The - OK, so it was cool for 1 song on their 1st album. But once I found out they'd done it on the whole album I figured these kids must be retarded. Then to find that they're applying the fuzzy mute effect to the vocals again on this release confirms my suspcion.The - it's just too bad their 1st album was so overplayed and overhyped. I'm so nauseated by the very thought of the strokes that even though they're god's compared to most of the drivel that's put out these days, they've become just another played to death band that everyone once loved. Reminds me of the rise and fall of Hootie and the Blowfish. (not that Hootie was any good mind you - just a comparison of the god awful media hype machine that kills good and bad bands before they get a chance)The - The End"
4,Completely unbiased...,"Are The Strokes the saviors of rock? No. Did they deserve all the acclaim their first album, Is This It, got? Probably not. Are they talented? Not particularly. Are they better than Interpol? Certainly Not. Are they any more than your average, garden variety power pop band? Hell no! Is this CD Great? You bet it is! Drawing equally from The Cars and The Doors, The Strokes have come up with a nice little formula and stuck with it: Poor production, cheesy synth work and tight song structures that get right to the point and will always entertain, no matter how ""manufactured"" their sound is. The production is shoddy, but it works. While the strokes are terribly overrated, they strive to live up to their praise with their sophmore release. And they come pretty damn close."
4,Make Note!!! It's 30 minutes long.,"The album is great, they repeat they're quick strumming power chord ound, very similar but still VERY good, I love the sound.Problem being, THE THING IS 30 MINUTES LONG!!!! Very disappointing."
2,NYC Hype,"The Strokes epitomize the East Coast hype machine gone berserk. Their handlers, record company execs, the NY media, and everyone else that is desperate to see any hip dudes from the Big Apple succeed on a national scale have all done their job in trying to convince us that these guys are the modern Beatles (or at least the modern Television). Meanwhile, people who know and love rock music aren't any more fooled by it than we are by Nickelback and Creed. Is This It left me thinking just that. I thought maybe The Strokes had more in the tank and the second album would show the world what the fuss was all about. So I anxiously but cautiously approached this album only to realize for sure that the tank is empty. The Strokes come across like a like a one-trick pony. This album doesn't suck but it's not that great either. Buy the White Stripes back catalog instead."
2,"What happens if you want a calendar, contacts, and that's it.?","Now the great tech choices seem to be a phone, or a phone, or a phone. I was most happy with Palm, and now they are no longer."
5,The Five Star Church,The book was delivered before the scheduled due date. The quality was superb. It was a new book minus the name written on the first page. I would definitely purchase for this person again. I am very pleased with Amazon.
5,Technology of the Gods book,This is a very interesting book of the past and more. Good readfor any body that wants to read of the Ancients.
1,SAVE YOUR MONEY!,"I AM A SPECIALS FAN,AND HAVE SEEN/HEARD THEM LIVE IN BOTH ORIGINAL AND REFORMED LINEUPS.IT IS AN INCREDIBLE EXPERIANCE.THIS RECORDING OF THEM LIVE IS OF POOR QUALITY AND MUDDIED/MUFFLED SOUND.I KNOW THIS AS I OWN IT."
2,"stupid, boring game with horrible live quality","Lemme just start buy saying DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!! Its another boring button masher that'll last your attention for a month and then get boring. With completely stupid graphics, horrible movement, every character has to be unlocked basically, you cannot battle people on live unless u have unlocked every character, (unless you wanna keep losing and losing and losing,) and thus mk deception keeps disconecting on xbox live which is a complete pain in the whats'it.Pros:-Puzzle combat is coolCons:-Boring gameplay-Bad graphics-Xbox live keeps disconecting with ONLY this game-You have to unlcok 2/3 of the characters, (i'm serious) it really is 2/3-fatalities are impossible to memorize-combos are rediculously strong-easy to be ""cheap.""-its a whopping $50"
3,easy to install,"I put these on my 1992 F250, they were easy to install and look great. I would order them again in a minute."
5,Wow!,"I've only had a chance to take some Christmas pictures of our pets (a wire hair fox terrier, a poodle and 2 cats) and love the look of the shots! Not sure how to post them here but if I figure it out I'll post a couple"
5,Nice problem.,So I just got my lens yesterday and took it for a ride. I LOVE everything about it. The images are dreamy-- the soft creamy bokeh and sharp-in-just-the-right-places look of my images make me sigh with delight. My only problem with this? I didn't know it came with a lens hood and bought a seperate one that will be arriving any day now. What a nice problem to have!
3,Nice....but ssslllllooooowwwww,"I'm a wedding/portrait photographer with other L series lenses (35L, 45tilt, 50, 70-200IS)....and in comparison to my other lenses, this is really slow at focusing. I love the range and am giving it a few months before I decide if I can adapt to the slowness of the focus."
4,BE CAREFUL - authorized dealer or not ???,"Canon 'L' lenses are, for the most part, superlative. The best. But be careful to look at the seller you choose to buy from. Some are NOT authorized Canon dealers and this means NO Canon warranty.To find out if a seller is an authorized Canon dealer run a google search for 'canon authorized dealer'.Or go to this link: [...]Make sure that in addition to an authorized dealer the Canon item you purchase is label 'USA warranty' and NOT 'gray market', or 'import market', etc. Canon USA warranty cards have areas of pinkish coloring (not just black and white). The USA warranty cards also clearly state 'USA warranty' in addition to having the serial number printed on them."
4,Inflated List Price,"This is an awesome lens. Sharp and fast with incredible Bokeh. It is in particular capable of exquisite portraits.However what the heck is Amazon trying to pull with this inflated list price? There is no way the list price on this is anything like $3500. Come on we weren't born under a cabbage leaf, nor are we stupid. Canon states the list price on there web site is 2,199.00.Shame on you Amazon."
5,An excellent cookbook from one of Floridas top food critics,"As a native Key Wester, most of my knowledge of Cuban cooking has been passed on to me via my family and local friends. When I moved to Tampa, (and on many trips to Miami) I noticed many differences and interpretations of classic Cuban dishes of my youth. Such differences are natural due to the verbal, generation-to-generation passing of Cuban cooking. It is very nice to see a cookbook that records this tradition and its variety.Joyce LaFray's book is the best example that I have seen of capturing true Cuban cooking. I have made a few of the recipes and can honestly say that they are excellent! Her recipe for ""Erasmo's Black Beans"" is out of this world - having sampled a hefty portion recently at a food tasting event.If you are experienced in cooking Cuban food; or a beginner who wants to look like a brilliant Cuban food chef - this book is for you. Go ahead and order it - you will be glad you did!"
1,this book is full of speculation and fantasy,"I deleted this from my kindle halfway through reading it. I probably am a sensitive person, but the author has made up way too much for this book to be useful. The whole book was annoying with HSP being written repeatedly. I was sick of reading about HSPs being ""aroused"". Couldn't she have picked a better word? And then getting into sexual abuse in childhood and repressed memories was an enormous red flag. This book is all speculative and based on no science. Save your money and read one of the excellent books about introverts."
2,HSP or just going through a bad time?,"I'm not very keen on self-help books. But I have found many things in this book that helped me during a bad time of my life. If you are sensitive for some external reasons, it may be helpful. However, be aware as you might end up thinking that you have limitations, instead of actually seeing your true value."
3,"excellent writing, bad PR and poor self-image for HSP","I consider myself highly sensitive. But I don't see it as a barrier/handicap.I like the writing of this book so much that I finished reading it shortly. It does describe many of my experience.But I am afraid that it gives a wrong message to people. Being highly sensitive doesn't mean a person will not be able to achieve well in ""daunting"" tasks. I have succeeded. The reason? I had a passsion.I'm also afraid that this book gives a message to the highly sensitive people that they will not be able to do certain things well, although it may sound comforting at first.Remember it's the PASSION that makes all the difference, not our psychological make-up."
5,A powerful read,"I can't say enough about the information in this book. It helped me come to some powerful revelations about myself. As it said it would, it profoundly changed how I will deal with my way of viewing my actions and reactions moving foward. I would recommend this book to anyone who thinks they are an HSP or knows one."
3,Book-Highly Sensitive People,"Haven't finished it yet, but was greatly relieved to find a book that identified what I have been experiencing all my life. Though the author is a psychologist, I don't have confidence that all the info in the book is correct. It just isn't convincing in places. The book, however, is very helpful and worth reading given the lack of info available. Lea"
3,More than just highly sensitive people,"Stimulation overload is experienced by more than just what she calls 'highly sensitive people.' Those experiencing ADHD, cognitive disabilities, and other frontal lobe difficulties can benefit from some of her advice."
2,Ramblings,"The author did not need to intellectually ramble in this book. Its content could have been shortened considerably. As a highly sensitive person myself, I found the book to be a downer. It had some good insights on early childhood development (functional vs. dysfunctional) and how family patterns are viewed differently by other siblings. Perhaps Dr. Aron could have given us more in-depth information about her own life experiences to enhance the book's value."
5,super super helpful,"my doctor recommended this book for me years ago & i finally got around to reading it. so glad for this super helpful book and for a doctor who understands me better than i understood myself. the wisdom and information in this book are making a huge difference in my day to day experience, and my self-esteem. thanks, dr. aron, & dr. morris!!"
3,Inaccurate right off the bat,"I am disappointed to say there is an error as early as page 12 in this book. Mr. Black states there are no accounts of Scotch prisoners taken during Cromwell's time. This is inaccurate. The R. Stanton Avery Special Collections Department of the New England Historic Genealogical Society located at 101 Newbury Street, Boston, MA has a copy/transcript/summary of a document from Cromwell to Lenthall which names some prisoners taken on Sept 3, 1650 and held at Durham in the charge of Sir Arthur Haselrig (Governor of Newcastle). Also, passenger lists from the ships ""Unity"" and ""John and Sara"" are widely available in print and online. Furthermore, the book ""Scotch Prisoners Sent to Massachusetts in 1652, By Order of the English Government"" lists many prisoners from Sept 1851 and sent to America. I am disappointed Mr. Black did not voraciously search out and locate primary source documents that pertain to some of our earliest Scotch ancestors in America."
4,I Can't Be Counted On,"The studio version of ""I Can't Be Counted On"" was just alright, but the live version is incredible. I'd buy this CD again (if I didn't already have it) just to have a copy of this version of ""I Can't Be Counted On""! The rest of the CD is pretty good, but anyone who hasn't heard the live version of ""I Can't Be Counted On"" really needs to get this CD!"
4,Puppets - Live in Montana exclusively for die-hards,"Live in Montana is a historic and sentimental offering that only long-standing Puppet fans could appreciate. In other words, when my wife is in the room, I'm not allowed to play this gem. Michele, please give them a fair chance, you know how important these geniuses are to me! Recorded at close to their artistic height in the late 80's, the listener gets the feeling that they're sometimes intentionally trying not to sound good, with gobbly incoherent vocals and uncohesively loose guitar/bass riffs. Nonetheless this collection compiled by Bostrom last year is a real treat for true fans. Does anybody know if Chris is officially dead?"
4,A wonderful friendshp...,This book was good. it starts it sexy funny and emtetaining tale on page one! You wil just love how everyfriend is different an meshed together in so many ways. I will try more from this author.
5,one small step for them; a new era for music,it was not what was expected; from the cutting and stopping of mezzanine floor to the final heavy bass of kiss your feet this album rocks.
5,A heavenly sound,This CD rocks. I can't wait to get the first one. I got the brand new one. Keep up the good work and stay God focused
3,Still good but not great!,I hate to be the spoilsport but I really didn't think this cd matched up to King of Fools. I kind of like what they had going on that cd. But I can't deny that these guys have great talent and are on fire for the Lord! They still are an awesome group with really good things to say in a style all their own.
2,Great Packaging / Poor soundboard,"Marketing wise, product is good. However, it is one of the poorest soundboard cd's of Elvis I've ever heard. Some of the mixes are plain bad. Average material if you are collector. If you are not an Elvis fan, avoid buying this cd."
5,LOVED THIS BOOK!,I borrowed this book from the local library-loved it so much that I bought my own copy! Excellent pictures and explinations of exactly how to add digital scrapbooking into your traditional scrapbooking world.
4,"Good Book , not for beginners","To understand this book you need some amount of advanced Stats knowledge , i work in the field of Data warehousing and was expecting to relate it to my present field ,I did some stats in college and got little lost in topics where advanced Stats was used. To get better understanding of the concepts discussed in this book please search for ""Statistical aspects of Data Mining"" on You tube , The lectures given in the aforementioned Google training can serve as a companion to this book"
5,Great Machine Learning Introduction,This is the book I used to introduce myself to data mining as graduate student in computer science. At the time I thought it was a very well organized and self contained book. Since then I have been studying machine learning full time and I still use this book to get really great explanations of key algorithms and concepts. Every time I go back to this book I'm surprised to find all sorts of topics covered that I hadn't noticed on previous readings. Basically it covers a good breadth of topics in an easy to understand manner. I highly recommend this book for anyone interested in data mining or machine learning.
5,I am very impressed,I have never come across such a good book..it's so easy to read and sensible...can be a great introduction to phd studies..fun book to read
4,Good for pre-sleep relaxation,"This is very relaxing, but I actually prefer ""Relaxed - Contemplative Soundscape....."" for playing after I actually get into bed. This music is good to play prior to going to bed, then I switch to the other one. I have serious insomnia problems and don't like to take strong medicine, so controlling my presleep environment is important."
5,I've never heard the end of it..,I bought this at the baby store I work at. I am a chronic insomniac and could never get to sleep in under two hours. With this one I'm out in twenty minutes.
3,My hubby loves it,"He said it smells very good, but i don't like it. I have a sensitive sense of smell and smells give me a headache."
1,don't waste your money,you can find most of this information on the internet. for free. i don't even know where the book is now.
5,Finally a diet that really works!,"This book, written by Dr. Joseph Mercola, sets forth an easy to follow no grain diet.The book itself is a little unorganized which causes confusion at some points. However, essentially this is not a fad diet and can easily be adapted to your lifestyle.I have lost weight with this diet where others except the expensive ""buy our pre-packaged"" food diets have failed.If you feel low on energy, sluggish, feel your memory and thinking is fuzzy and you're blaming it on getting older, you must try this no-grain diet."
4,Mercola and his products,"I do not own this book but it appears that people believe it has more receipes than nutritional info (particularly compared to the information on his website). Moreover, a lot of the info on this book can be accessed from the website. So one has to ask himself...do I like to read and upload page by page on the website and spend hours looking around or do I like to flip through a book quickly? I've done the spending hours looking around his website already so this book may not be as ""needed"" for me. But it's still a great item to have in my library and/or to give/show to my friends and family. I've learned so much from him in terms of nutrition and to start thinking critically about what the mass media ""feeds"" me. Of course, you may not agree with everything he says but then it's up to you to continue your research isn't it? Also, I've enjoyed many of his products that he recommended."
3,"Good information, bad format and inconsistent","I'm very disappointed in the format of this book. Most of the content in this book was good information about why we should go grain free and I agree with Dr. Mercola, but I think Mercola could of done a way better job in planning out the book and making it easier on the reader. Also, he is inconsistent in his diet plan. In the advance plan he states no legumes, but in the menu plan for advance you can eat hummus and pinto beans. Not to mention his diet plan is labor intensive if you have a job or a family to take care of."
2,So disappointed on book condition,"The info in the book was good but there was wayyy too many underlined words, I found it to be too distracting from what I'm reading. They needed to be more honest and say there is a bit of marked pages through out book and writing in the back of book!"
1,Labels that don't stick...,"I just got these today and while the designs are fun, the labels themselves are basically useless. They don't stick well, which sort of defeats the whole point of a label. I don't think I'd want to send one on a letter, because it would probably fall off. If you don't mind taping these down (which looks oh-so-chic), get 'em. Otherwise, pass.I wonder if I can return these???"
3,Actually 3 1/2 stars....,"This is the first of the series and it is a decent read, but at times looks like a first novel. It drags a bit but like I have said before Kellerman is not capable of writing a bad book. His average one's are better than 50 percent of what is being published today!Kellerman does a superb job of detailing a 7-year old who is the possible only witness to a crime and her down-and-out mother, who should take parenting classes. I won't give away much, but this shows enough to get u hooked on Kellerman, Delaware (the main character), and Milo (his friend). A worthy debut!Kellerman exhibits charcterization, smooth storytelling, and fantastic plotting. The only draw-back is lengthy conversations and parts that are a little slow. Nothing to convince u NOT to PURCHASE the BOOK!Good job, Jon!"
5,Great book,Really enjoyed the story line and of course the writing of Kellerman is always great reading. Looking forward to meore books by him.
3,Clearly a freshman effort,"I've read some of the later Alex Delaware books and really enjoyed them. This is the first one in the series and it's obvious that Mr. Kellerman is trying to find his voice. There are some points in the plot that stretch credulity and some spots where Delaware makes some incredible leaps of intuition. Additionally, although most of the dialog was acceptable, frankly the conversations between Delaware and his girlfriend were extremely stilted. He calls here ""Doll?""!!!"
3,ok product,"great for cutting smaller nails but doesn""t work on large nails. still a great product for the price. tried other brand and this one works the best"
3,Saturn dashmat issues,"Dashmat was a poor fit,, but easily trimmed... It does what I got it for, protect the dash top. I got what I paid for."
3,Wonderfully soothing,I listen to music while I work as an accountant - it keeps me from becoming too stressed when the numbers don't work. Very calming music - almost like I'm listening to the birds outside on my deck with someone playing light music in the background.
5,it's fast service and the battery works,"as long as this treo keeps working, i'm using this service for my battery needs"
2,Not as Advertised,"The battery is advertised as an extended battery, it is not. It barely last one day if that. Still, a good price and compares to the regular battery."
5,Pratchett Classic,"It's been a while since I listened to the book, so I can't recall how much it deviated. I understand Pratchett is involved in the adaptation, so I assume it meets his artistic vision. Anyways, it's fun! Good characters, of course. Vetenari is perfectly casted as Dance. The others did a good job, too--especially Groat. I was impressed how well they did the golems, and the clacks towers. Overall good fun, but I gotta say I still like both The Hogfather and Thief of Time better."
4,Entertaining!,Witty and suspenseful. Reminds me of a Guy Richie film. Josh (David Plescia) and Zack (Rock Graziano) deliver in this film about two guys that shouldn't be criminals. Its worth a watch!
2,Skip it,"I had high hopes for this book, since I often read yaoi and slash fanfiction online. However, I couldn't even get through this anthology due to cliched plots that have been done much better online (slaves, fantasy, etc), and just overall low-quality writing. Some of the short stories even disgusted me, and I don't usually consider myself squeamish when it comes to yaoi/slash. This was a good idea and a noble attempt, but it only brings out the worst in slash fanfiction :(."
4,"A gripping ""what if"" thriller...","I found this to be a very engrossing read - I couldn't out it down! Yes, it does suffer somewhat from a less than complete job of editing but this does not rise to the level of significantly interfering with the story. Berryman does an effective job of connecting related events (a la Tom Clancy but not quite at Clancy's level of mastery) in a plausible future with an imperialistic China run amok. The exploration of the relative cultural and political strengths and weaknesses of the various nations involved as they would impact such a scenario make for an interesting enhancement to the storyline. One warning though, if you consider yourself among the progressive, socially enlightened or politically correct, then you probably won't enjoy this book very much - Libertarians, Neo-cons and other foreign policy conservatives dive in and enjoy!"
1,Right wing fantasy,Juvenile right wing garbage. The author is trying to ape Tom Clancy's style while expounding on every far right theory from economics to foreign policy. Dense with useless information about characters and plots you couldn't care less about.
1,"too small NOT a medium, won't contact me for return",Don't bother with this seller...this item was NOT a medium and the seller will notanswer me regarding a return.
5,Arresting,"Prior to ""Angel"", I would not have described myself as a big Sarah McLachlan fan. After hearing it, however, I would say enthusiastically to anyone, ""Add my name to the list!"" This song is quite simply one of the best songs -- if not THE best song -- that I have ever heard. Few recordings merit such praise, but this one does. It actually re-defines the adjectives used to describe it: touching, ethereal, arresting, haunting, inspired, divine, etc.. ""Angel"" is truly a classic on par with ""Amazing Grace."" Be careful when listening to it, though: Should you happen across it while scanning your car radio's dial for listening fare, it will halt your search and transport your mind somewhere else, so you'd better pull over to the side of the road before you cause an accident."
5,The BEST song,This is the best song I have heard her sing. It is so nice to listen too. I enjoy it a lot it's AWESOME
3,White Eagle Red Star Review.,"The last page of the book I found to be disturbing. Why the author included this particular story, I do not know. The story may or may not be true.Other than the above, a 'well done' to Mr. Davies for having written about the Polish-Soviet war of 1919-1920."
4,A useful history,A well detailed history of an important conflict that does not get enough attention in English language sources. An interesting read for anyone interested in the interwar period in Europe.
3,Maha PowerEx MH-C204W4AA27,"Way too expensive for a smart charger that requires batteries to be recharged in pairs. There are much better choices out there. A charger should be able to recharge any combination and number up to 4 total of AA and AAA cells individually.Better charger choices include:(31 bucks) La Crosse Technology BC500(42 bucks) La Crosse Technology BC-700 Alpha(45 bucks) Maha PowerEx MH-C401FS (great and very easy to use)(45 bucks) Maha PowerEx MH-C401FS4AA27(51 bucks) Maha Powerex Wizard One MH-C9000 (great, but not that easy to use)RECHARGERS TO AVOID:Maha PowerEx MH-C204W(4AA27/4AA25)Maha Powerex C204GT-DC"
4,I love this video,"I really love this one...It's not too long (40-45min) is a great leg/hips workout with the box and the ab segment is the hardest one I have ever done...This is not a beginner workout and you must have a box...The box segments are difficult although will produce results, I really like the instructor, she is no BS and explains things well...And did I mention that the ab workout at the end is fantastic?? Again do not attempt this tape if you are a beginner."
2,"Workout's okay, instructor is disappointing","I hate to sound mean, but I just can't abide this instructor. I have DOZENS of Firm tapes, but this is the one tape I gave away. She's nice, but a poor instructor - her cuing is late on the moves, and to me, it's really distracting. Get another Firm tape, most of them have great lower body sections. Forget this one."
2,Paint chips off,Red paint on both the patch holder and the rod chips and rubs off after only a handful of uses. Fortunately the paint is red and easily removed from the barrel & shell chambers. I used this to clean both an automatic pistol and a revolver. The Saf-T-Clad appears to be nothing more than paint.
1,Another Copycat/Christ Myther,"After rading this book I have to say it was convincing, that is until I read the rebuttal by Modern Apologists. If any one of you think this is a ""great book with many irrefutable points"" PLEASE check out this website ...copy and paste it in your browser.It does a great job of refuting the points of this book. The author of this book is not even a wel kown biblical scholar.She uses arguments that were used in te 19th century by liberals, but have now since been pronounced dead by modern scholarship. Please dont take my word for it but check out the rebuttal yourself. Thank You."
1,"Same tired, uneducated, angry claims of New Agers","Terrified of Yahweh? Hope He isn't real? This isn't the book for you. ""Archaeologist, historian, mythologist, and linguist"" Acharya S, a New Ager, makes the same tired, uneducated claims any New Age author makes about the Bible and Christianity. No scholarship; no evidence; only quotes from other New Agers and infidels. Acharya, seemingly angry at someone or everyone, gives the reader nothing new. However, if you don't find the book compelling, you can flip to the end of it and order ""The Time Travel Handbook,"" ""Atlantis: Mother of Empires"" or ""Lost Continents & The Hollow Earth."" I'm betting those books are better reads than ""The Christ Conspiracy."" If you hope (and that's all you can do - hope) to calm your fears about Yahweh, you'll have to dig do better than ""The Christ Conspiracy."""
3,"Good read, but poorly documented","This is a comprehensive, well-written book that deals with the alternative/radical/non-traditional vision of Jesus which is increasing in popularity. Though nowhere nearly as useful as other similar books (e.g., Freke & Gandy's works), it deals with a much broader set of issues. Generally well researched, my main criticism of the book is the poor documentation. Many critical quotations are not referenced, and many references are incorrect. When dealing with non-traditional ideas, the author needs to be scrupulously correct. This authors plays it ""fast and loose"" and that seriously devalues the usefulness of the book. I'd love to see a revision with more attention to the documentation. That would be an excellent book. Meanwhile the book is nonetheless valuable, and most of the references I looked into myself were correct, but this was not universally true."
5,Very interesting take on an agelong debate.,"The writer's expertise and arguments are very compelling. She uses archeology and anthropology to argue a controversial claim. If this work is viewed and read from an objective standpoint, then I feel that it can be very useful for an atheist or a Christian."
1,A tired and overworked premise.,"In spite of all the grandiose hype, there is nothing new to be discovered here. The author has merely repeated the research of other authors, who have said it better and said it first. Perhaps some original research on her part would have improved the book. As it stands, it is every bit as exciting as summer re-runs of tired soap operas."
5,5 stars all the way!,This is a great book!The author touches on so many factual points that I don't see how anybody could disagree with her. This book is definately an eye opener for Christians. Only read it if you have an open mind.
1,Translations,"This anthology covers a lot of ground. However, I found the Qu'aran translation much too difficult to read. Other translations tend to use stilted or outdated language."
4,Excellent product,The dog does feel better and at 12 and 1/2 years old for a large dog she still moves reasonably. No problems running and climbing around. Goes up and down the stairs well - she was limping badly before we started giving her this product.
3,My dog did not like it.,"I was hoping my dog would eat these since other reviews said their dogs did. However, my dog would not eat these. I even tried wrapping them in cheese. My dog is pickier than most though, so perhaps other dogs would eat them. They did arrive as promised."
2,Dog doesn't care for the flavor,Our 8 year old Vizsla ate the first one but refused every subsequent offering. I now have to mash it into a powder and mix it with wet dog food for her to take it. I won't buy it again.
4,Doug Swanson is SO underrated,"Jack Flippo's 3rd adventure is another energetic romp through Big D. More sex & violence this go round, both for the good and bad. Great believable but crazy characters including the return of gangsta and neat freak Teddy N. Tunstra. If you can find it, you will like it."
5,A Fresh New Take on Stay-At-Home Motherhood,"Vera Nicholas-Gervais takes an often-overlooked approach to the stay-at-home phenomena in Time Out: Soul Talk for Stay-at-Home Moms. While celebrating women's decisions to spend quality time with their babies, Nicholas-Gervais is not afraid to tell the truth: stay-at-home motherhood is no cakewalk. Written in an easy-to-read, conversational style, Time Out depicts the gamut of new mothers' emotions, from exhilaration and bliss to depression and anxiety. So the next time you're on your knees, cleaning up spilled formula while the phone rings and the baby screams, you can take solace in the knowledge that you're not alone."
5,My Mommy & Me Story Bible,"My wife loves this book. She and the kids really enjoy the time together having fun while learning. Each story is just long enough to teach a little, but still holds their attention."
2,"The dirt, m'am, nothing but the dirt","Lita Grey as hardly an important figure in the career of the great Chaplin. She was, of course, a scandalous footnote, one of the many far-too-young women in his life. Her time with Chaplin was brief, so any notion of her being any level of expert on him is, at best, vague.Her influence on his art is greatly overstated, her impact on his life was limited to his wallet, and this book won't give anyone any legitimate insight into the artist or the man. It is just a self-serving tome, and not worth your while.Leave us not support this; avoid, except for the titillation value."
2,Not in the same league as earlier books in the series...,Very few objects to engage kids. I consider myself well informed on marine life but had never heard of a Nurse Shark! And how will kids relate with that!
3,"Great for the beginner, solid.","The book is very short; under 70 pages. But is has good drawings, sticks to the point (pun intended), and doesn't waste words. The illustrations are particularly good regarding targets. The sparring section is okay, and blade throwing takes up about a third of the book. This with a little common sense will take you pretty far."
5,A wonderful book in journal form,I purchased this book two years after my premature baby was born. Reading and working through this journal helped my deal with issues relating to my baby's birth and subsequent hospital stay. It is an excellent place to record feelings and emotions that at times are too painful to express in any other way. I highly recommend this book to parents of premature infants.
2,Ho-hum,"Songs of Enchantment is a sequel to Booker Prize winning The Famished Road--one of the best novels I've ever read. But Ben Okri's attempt to outdo his first novel with this sequel had a disastrous result. He gives the readers an overdose of magic and supernatural. He describes one strange event after another (and almost in every succeeding sentence), distracting the readers and leaving them no time to savor one magical event at a time. (The Famished Road just has an amount of magic just enough for the readers to enjoy.) Ben Okri's prose has always been beautiful to read, but this time it didn't work. I couldn't find patience to finish the entire book."
5,Good Boxers for men,Well one of the things I can safely say about them is that they are very comfortable and good fabric.
3,Not the best I've owned,"I purchased 9 of these about 9 months ago. So far, I don't like them. Get weggies all the time because only a single seem in the back. The elastic is not as tight as I would like or expect. I find these slipping down ""inside"" my pants."
2,Man O Man the price,Another waistband that is OK I guess.They don't make the old type that is better.Even with the great prices at Amazon the price of a pair is OUTRAGEOUS. Talk about inflation!!!!$4-6 for a single pair?!!Ack....EEK!.....Arghhh.....gurgle....choke...collapse......
4,Something different.,"i first heard Chronic Future on the Warped Tour 2004 cd, instantly i liked the sound of the band and so i bought the CD. The rap lyrics may be a little cheesey but they flow well into the sung chorus's that sound great. The songs are basicly all laid out the same but each one sounds distinctly different. Overall a great album, and it's something different from all other bands."
5,Spectacular!!!,These are 24 of Julio's best hits but his hits go far beyond this album in my opinion. Such songs like Amor and Quijote didn't quite make it on this album. Many of the songs on this album are Julio's earlier songs like Pobre Diablo and Abrazame. Julio first made his fame in Spain then moved to the United States. His music is listened to worldwide. With over 100 albums Julio Iglesias is one of the most successful Latin singers in the world. A star of the 70's and 80's his romantic Spanish ballads were heard all over Europe and the world including Latin America and even as far as Israel of which Julio is on his mother's side. His father was a doctor in Madrid Spain. This album comes with two CDs. Every song is great. With the first song Quiereme Mucho to the last song you won't want to stop listening to these classic Spanish hits!
3,Sizes,"Slip quality is very nice. HOWEVER, the slip length is 2"" shorter than noted on the sizing chart. I measured my daughter's skirt and needed the slip to be exactly 28"" (for size 10) and it only measures 26""!"
5,Perfect for our little princess,We ordered this as we needed an inexpensive crinoline for a tea length dress and we needed it fast. Shipping time was super quick and the item was much better quality than I expected. Puffs her Laura Ashley silk dress out just the right amount for the local pagent she's going to be in next week. We ordered a size large since she's tall for her age and it fit her beautifully- we just have to roll the waist a little bit and then she can use it again at Christmas. Now if I can just convince her not to want to wear it under every sun dress until then I'll be a happy camper. If you want a great product at a great price and you want it quick you should order it here.
4,Nine West Boot Review,Great shoes for a great price. Boots are comfortable and have enough traction so they're not too slippery.
5,Great product,It releaves my dry scalp and sends a heated tingling. It is more intense when I put a silk cap on my head.
2,Awkward and Annoying Format,"The search words appear on the left-hand page and the coordinating puzzle on the right-hand page. From a lounging position it's necessary to bend the left-hand pages around the back of the book, which is difficult because this book is very thick. And then you need to keep flipping the book back and forth from the search word page to the puzzle page. This book is best used sitting at a desk. Not a relaxing or enjoyable puzzle experience."
4,Good quality test leads,I purchased these as an upgrade to the ones my Fluke meter came with. I've been happy with them and would recommend them.
3,it's ok,"The soundscapes are nice, but it seems as though the musicians aren't quite proficient with the traditional instruments used on the record. They play these instruments as if they were guitars, depleting the potential of their vision. Or maybe they were just drunk..."
5,Strong latch,"I got this to hold my closet double doors shut. They previously had the smaller weaker magnets, but one of them broke. I just replaced both of the magnets on the door frame with this longer one and kept the original metal strips on the doors. It works wonderfully! Its strong and takes a bit of a small tug to open the doors, which is exactly what I'm looking for. My toddler son can't get into the closet as easily. I highly recommend this product"
1,No Way,"Big tube which is always nice, but the product was just like a stick of chalk for me. Not much mositure and the smell wasn't as it was described so I returned it."
4,They're back,"The <shudder> WHOLESOMENESS of the original adventures are back. Just so much fun, and still stimulating and encouraging natural curiosity. Who knew boys had so much fun even before video games?? The plots get a little thinner in this one but it's well worth it to return to the gang."
1,Acting over all is grade Z,"The story is not bad but the acting over all is grade Z. Were oh were did they find the actor who plays the handicapped kid in this movie (Ricardo Gray) ? Ricardo Gray should find another job and I mean that from the bottom of my heart, this dude can not act a lick. Remington (Timothy Muskatell) is the main character in the film and he is good as a crazed grifter hell bent on doing what ever he feels like at any cost. Mild nudity, lame gore and all around debauchery is not enough to keep this turd afloat as this movie is bad from start to final end. Stay away."
1,It Doesn't work,"If you put in Audible, the dog and you get in silence, but only with ""Ultrasonic"" no body lisen it, you or the dog.Don't work.I don't ask for the money because I'm in Chile and is mor expensive send it than the product.Regards.Nicolas Ortiznikingdomm@hotmail.com"
1,Waste of money,"A complete waste of money. Our dogs are completely unaffected by the ""ultrasonic sound"". We tried all settings, low, high and even audible. The audible setting will emit a loud piercing sound, much like a smoke detector alarm, and it almost deafened me when I turned it on. My dogs looked at me like I'm an idiot. Maybe I am for wasting my money on this junk."
5,excellent book,"""Optimal Control Theory for Applications"" by D. Hull builds the optimal control theory starting from basic concepts. The use of differentials allow a deeper understanding of what the term ""variation"" means. Difficult concepts are explained with high clarity. As an example, one could compare the explanation of controllability in Hull's book and in the classical Bryson's book ""Applied Optimal Control"". In this book, controllability and the more advanced concepts on 2nd order optimality conditions are deduced in an extremely rigorous, clear fashion. The chapter on guidance is also valuable. The last three chapters cover approximation methods and a comprehensive treatment of the methods for transcribing optimal control problems into parameter optimization problems. I recommend this book to undergraduate students as well as to scientists that work in the field of applied optimization."
2,Beware of inaccuracies,Just thumbing through this I found two errors. Russell Crowedid not win back to back Oscars and Helen did not lose toSusan Sarandon but to Dianne Wiest in 1994. Don't know how manymore there are. Too bad the author did this because it makesme suspect that there are other inaccuracies. Dame Helendeserves better. There are a lot of nice photographs included.
2,Works ok. Poor Build,"These are no replacement for a 'pro' unit - with interference problems at anything over a 20 or so yard line-of-site distance. More disturbing, the hot shoe mount on the receiver broke off after about my 10th use - rendering it pretty useless. And this was light duty use."
4,A very good value,"The Model 98's a pretty rugged marker, and this barrel is a great improvement on the stock version. I also like the sight (believe it or not, it really is useful!).All in all, this is a very good price for the entire package!-Scott Malensekauthor ofThe Weekend Warriorsand50+Ways to Play With Your Paintballs"
5,Excellent Textbook for undergraduate students!!,"I think this is an excellent textbook for digital system design as well as VHDL synthesis. lots of information both on academic and industry! easy to read, understandable and very neat. highly recommended to begginner!The only thing can be improved might be the font size of VHDL codes. It should be much better if it looked smaller than current."
2,.,"Just like other reviwers said: there is very little paint in each of those circles. My daughter used all green in one ""session""."
1,Physics for Scientists and Engineers,I actually wanted to give this book a zero rating but was notgiven the option. Dr. Lerner may be an excellent physicist but he is aterrible textbook writer. This book explains nothing to a beginning physics student. The examples and questions are confusing and worthless...
1,Don't EVER use this book for intro physics,"Our entire class has virtually thrown this book out and adopted other physics texts. While I am sure it covers the material, it does not teach you physics -- perhaps a good review text for those brushing up, but as an intro text I found it vague and obtuse. While I have never taken physics before, I do maintain a 4.0 GPA, and what little I have been able to derive from Lerner's text was hard fought on my part. Lerner does not address his audience effectively. He often explains theory as his only example of a concept, he does not provide nearly enough sample problems of the very basic nature, and the end-of-the-chapter problems are occationally so badly worded you cannot really tell what he intends his reader to solve. This text needs a very thorough editing before it can be a very good introductory text."
1,Ignorance is bliss,"Bob Scott's book is a good example of horrible historical research. If you want to argue that John Chivington was not an awful person and that he was justified, so be it. However, use more resources than basic encylopedias. During the course of the book, Scott contradicts himself, ignores reams of testimony that don not back his case, and gets facts wrong. If you want a better researched, more fair-minded read, check out Stan Hoig's book or David Svaldi's on sand Creek."
5,Always VERY good.,"Used to get at Costco , but not in our location as yet. These are so good ! Great gifts and no one complains !"
5,Tied for best show ever.,"This show ( along with The Simpsons) is great. Matt Greoning is a pure genius. If you like The Simpsons or Star Trek, you will LOVE THIS!"
5,My kids love Futurama,Got a great deal on this set and got it for a gift for my son. He loves the series.
2,Too pricey for a full set with no worthy bonus features...,"This is an outstanding series, but at an incomprehensible price. It comes with no bonus items like the Family Guy party pack (which was $60 on a Gold Box Deal, BTW...for those that missed it...and has 18 DVDS...five seasons plus the Stewie Griffin Story, Ping Pong gear, a Stewie DVD case, cards, poker chips, and a frickin' sweet box).Go to your friendly neighborhood Walmart (among other retail outlets), and you can find each volume of Futurama priced at approximately $20. This series is not a rarity (in fact, I've got a good third of it on my DVR). Amazon was selling each volume for $18 a while back, which I'm assuming was to celebrate the release of Beast with a Billion Backs. That's about what each volume is worth. I wouldn't pay more than $24 for it. Trust me...it'll be around for a long, long time.I'd say not to purchase this now. Wait until it's a Gold Box Deal with both movies included for the not so low, but acceptable price of $80."
4,Strong bags,"I am using these bags for weight. The price was very good and the bags are performing as advertised. Note that the bags are expected to deteriorate with exposure to the sun over times. So if you can put them out of the sun when not in use, you may extend the life of them"
1,Very poor quality,"Like the other reviewer, the bags I used fell apart from sun exposure within two months. And what a mess they made. The claim of being UV resistant is doubtful from my experience. Luckily I only used a few bags before I discovered this issue. The rest of them will go in the trash."
5,This is a good movie but not a whole lot of zombies,"This movie is story driven and not a special effects movie. What gives this movie it unique and refreshing perspective is it lurks on fringe, the edge of the zombie genre. It stays true to it genre but not so much as to be completely predictable. I would recommend this movie for most, if you need to see lots of gore go somewhere else, if you looking for something different this is it."
3,Not a zombie movie,Pontypool was didn't cut it as a zombie movie but it was an interesting movie none the less.
2,Yawwwwwwwwwwwwn!,"Do you like zombie movies? Do you want to see a zombie movie with zombies? If you answered yes to either of these questions than this movie may not be for you. However, if you want to watch a couple of bit-rate actors murmur bland dialogue, in practically the same setting the entire movie, you might just rate this movie as average. This movie is like being stuck in a junior high school AV club for one and a half hours with a deep voiced radio host and an annoying producer, neither of whom are very funny nor intelligent. Once again, Zombie movie without Zombies."
2,Terrible movie...stay away.,"I'll give it this...the first 30 minutes or so are interesting. It's a neat set up to a situation that really just never comes together.The acting and dialog is TERRIBLE. It's almost hard to watch at times as some of it just doesn't make sense.It's really too bad as the premise for the story is neat, but unfortunately that doesn't make a cohesive story.Stay away, or wait for this in a bargain bin for a couple of bucks."
5,Wonderful,I've enjoyed this movie a number of times. Its not perfect in any way but it is a lot of fun.
4,Pontypool,"Great flick, who knew this type of thing (not giving it away) could turn people into ravenous killer zombie like psychos?"
4,Good Cleaning Rod,"I'm pretty happy with this cleaning rod, I used it pretty extensivly to clean a few rifles. It seems like it will last and it's well coated."
2,"Good Effort, but not the best from AB/CD","AB/CD is an AC/DC cover band that release their own songs to sound like AC/DC numbers. This album contains the tracks1. White Moonshine Maker2. Mikeys Butt3. Twelve Beers4. Attack of the perfume turd5. Too short to be king6. 6 feet down below7. MTV recipe8. Face Lift Boogie9. Bengus Handjob10. Rock N rolex11. Elvis, Bugs and OldiesQuite frankly the only song on here I think that is worth listening to is ""Twelve Beers"" AKA: She looks good after 12 beers. If you are interested in this band, you may want to pass up on this album and go for ""Rock N Roll Devil"" instead. Not much of the songs on here stick out, in-fact I have had this album for a few years now, and can't even recall any of the songs off this album other then ""Twelve Beers"" and a few instrumentals that use Bengus's tap playing, which doesn't sound like Angus Young to me."
4,What a Concept !,"This book is a long time coming. I mean, really when you think about it , we really ARE what we listen to. This book hits right at the heart of the matter. It has the favorite records of everyone from Monica Lewinski to Shaquille O'Neal to Wynona Ryders to Nikki Sixx' to David Schwimmer to Jackie Chan to Joan Rivers to you Name it... This is a very revealing look at Celebrity record collections like I have never seen it before . Bravo! Bravo !"
4,Great for a class,"This text is great for a class on graphics. The reader may find it challenging to do a self-study however as it assumes a lot of prior mathematics... some of which the reader would not have unless he/she has studied the field of graphics before. While the book does cover most of the math in it either directly or in an appendix in the back, the book's treatment of the material is decidedly utilitarian and lacks the depth or breadth that a true mathematical text would have on such material. It is for this reason that it receives only 4 out of 5 stars. As an aid to lectures in class, this book is very good, provided one's professor covers the requisite math needed in order to understand it."
2,Eye-burning perfume all over these tough garbage bags,"These bags are tough and convenient to use, but whatever chemicals are used to perfume these is strong and unpleasant smelling to me. The smell is strong enough that it makes my eyes sting and water a little bit. I feel that the strong perfume smell overwhelms any trash odors rather than these bags having any actual de-oderizing ability.Because of the strong, unpleasant smell I'm very unlikely to ever buy these again."
3,They're OK,"These bags are ok. I like the forceflex feature because they stretch and it's not as easy for the bag to rip and leak all over inside the can or as you carry it outside. As for the febreze and odor shield features, they pretty much don't exist. The bag smells good when you take it out of the box, but let's face it, after a day or two your garbage smells like garbage and makes you want to gag. If the bags without the odor shield are cheaper just buy those because these don't help the smell."
4,UNIVERSAL SOLDIER 3 PRETTY GOOD,"I was kinda wondering why the original cast weren't in part 2 or 3, but the new storyline got better and I also liked it because Jeff Wincott was in it. All of Jeff Wincott's movies gotta be good, so I rented it and found out it was."
2,Time problems,"I ordered this book on the 3rd of April. I did not receive the book until the 9th of May. I ordered the book on April third because I needed to read it for class. The assignment has since passed, and I didn't have the book!. I am very upset that the shipping took so long and I would not do business with this person again"
4,Lots of good information,"This book gives alot of good information about the settling of the west and about many key figures who influenced the settlement of what was a vast wilderness area. The writing style is sometimes a bit too pedantic and this is not light reading that you'll go through quickly. However, the volume of information makes this book worth it. The closing of the American frontier and the settlement of the west are interesting subjects and this book does a good job of covering them.I welcome feedback on this and all reviews at wstrnlibwarrior@yahoo.com"
1,Non working examples and no structure,This book did absolutely nothing to help me understand InterDev beyond what I figured out on my own with the product. I spent a weekend with it. I was a waste of money. I will only get pleasure from it when I use it instead of a Presto-Log in the fireplace next season.
5,Conch Bearer,"Excellent book for pre-teens and adults. As always the author delivers a great story with great character development, you feel as though you are right there with them during their adventure."
4,Journey,"This Book is an alright book. The book takes place in present day but, it kinda sets you back a little. anyway the book is about a kid named anand and he has set out with an Master healer from the brotherhood named Abhaydatta and a homeless girl who later on gets the name Nisha. When they embark on this Journey they will meet many misfortune from a baned Brother of the Brotherhood trying to get ahold of the conch that anand has to carry(The Conch Bearer) and anand has to make many decisions on his own and finds out that he has been doingg something no other magician has done, Talk to the conch, the conch will give him advice thrououtt this journey but not always and leaves anand delayed.I hope you have found this review helpful because this is an okay boo but you should read it."
2,uhh,"its an okay book, ive read better...its really realistic in the food and culture. its okay. okay, i really didnt like it. sorry, but its not my kind of book."
2,"good samba tunes, not 100% authentic","This album was decent. I enjoyed the rhthyms, although I've heard a lot better. I had been wondering why it was so inexpensive. There are no big hits, and the lyrics are in Spanish (while Samba is native of Brazil, where Portuguese is spoken). The lyrics were good, though; just not <<autentico brasileiro>> ( although most of the artists were Brazilian, I think). All in all, I have heard much better compilations, but the price is tough to beat- finding good latino music without paying an arm & a leg is tough in New England, as well as probably most of the US & Canada."
4,"Domke PhoTOGS vest, XX-Large",I'm sure glad that Domke looks out for big guys like me. This vest is very comfortable. I especially like the fact that the pockets are deep and secure so that bulky items like DSLRs and lenses do not accidentally fall out. I find that a vest distributes the weight of my equipment more uniformly over my shoulders than a backpack does. With a little systematic foresight it is easy to find things like memory cards and batteries. Lens changes are made easy with the spacious pockets.
5,the best for its blade size,"it is the best way for his prize, u get all u need for boy scout, camping, easy job wherever u arei think is the best way to chose among all of its blade size. if u need a longer blade better to check the other models with longer and bigger bladeanyway i think it is the most complete one! for some hard works, useful everywhere!if u need something rustier, maybe letherman wave!"
4,It's not that simple.,"The question of Dasein, for Heidegger always, questioning is a ""way""... Heidegger does pronounce Dasein as being-towards-death, but Derrida's tiff is not with Dasein's non-relational to death; in fact he recognizes as such (not 'as such')-- the negativity of Dasein, its dying- or being-towards-death is always already before and beyond that which can be represented. So Derrida is revealing a problem with Heidegger's speaking of Dasein at all in this context (he is not objecting to 'as such' on the basis that Dasein is towards an end, rather the possibility -which is then, right then, an impossibility- that Heidegger can ever say 'as such' about that which can never be represented."
3,"Enjoyable, but not always for the right reasons","Nancy and George are vacationing in England, and, of course,the hotel at which they are staying is plagued by someone whoperpetrates dangerous pranks. It's a fast and fun read, but some partsare just a little bit incredible. OK, really incredible. Now really, would a woman not recognize her own sister when Nancy sees the resemblance instantly? It's funny, but it wasn't meant to be.Not the best or most tightly plotted ND, but, again, a fun read."
5,Winning is what it is all about!,"After continual phone calls and sending duplicate bills, my client did not answer or respond to the long overdue debt. Like all my billings for professional work completed, payment was due upon receipt of the completed appraisal......After calls to my client's attorney that brought no results, I decided for the first time in my business career to use the small claims court. In view of my ignorance as to the procedure to follow, I proceeded to investigate books available on the subject.The book Barron's Legal-Ease Small Claims Court Step by Step, appealed to me because I could understand it....it was written in layman's language. It took all the mystery out of the process. The bottom line is Dr. Rothstein's book made me a winner as I received the 2,800 dollars due. A wonderful book for every business person. Babette Cohen Appraisals"
3,Cover that Graay,"The product was okay, but takes a bit longer then I like to get it the gray covered. It also sometimes pulls your hair, because the lipstick like color is very hard not like lipstick, but all in all it helps."
1,does not work well,This product does not work well at all. You can barely get the thing to get on your hair. Waste of money. I would not recommend this product.
4,Good quality-great price,Pleasantly surprized at the quality for the price. Charcoal color also looks great on the black interior and feel is soft and warm..Very satisfied!!!!!!
2,Knew it was not going to be good coming into it...,"I got this just for Tawny Fere (Tawny Ellis now). I loved her in Rockula, and grabbed this because she was a member of the cast. Now I know better than to grab a movie just to see someone in it...Story was pretty poor, but the acting was atrocious, as were the special effects. Not atrocious like Plan 9 or something that is so bad it becomes good, but just bad.So many better ways to spend money..."
2,"maybe the truth, but not very useful","Unless you know nothing about team management or how people learn (meaning different learning styles, working styles, etc.) find a better book. This book goes on and on about what you should do but gives you little pragmatic advice on how to get it done. I read the book and had virtually no insights into team management at all. It's analysis is kind of like: ""well, you make money in the stock market by buying when the stock is low and selling when the stock is high"" (but never telling us how to do that)."
4,good tie down anchors,"These bully clamp tie downs work well. I have used them for conventional rope-style anchor points as well as hooks to carry buckets. Good design, and seems to be durrable too."
4,Nice Product,"As usual, the factory tie downs on my 2011 F 150 are not in the right place most of the time. This product attaches easily to the side rails and can be easily moved if needed. They appear to hold very well when used directly across from each other. The only problem I had was when I was trying to go diagonally was that they don't seem to hold as well when the forces are lateral versus straight across. I really tightened them up and it appears to help, but, I would caution people to be a little more careful when putting a lot of tension on them when pulling from corner to corner. Overall, though, I am totally satisfied with the product."
3,Bully says it all,"I had these on my Dodge truck, then my dodge truck got totaled, these things survived beautifully, and I loved the versatility of being able to move them where I needed them, worked great with my Leer cap. Did not fit well on the smaller side walls of a 90's Ford F250"
4,Enjoyable for all,It's a nice morality tale that doesn't over-preach or hide the story itself underneath the lessons to be learned. The story is also a nice change from the usual kids' morality fare.
2,No holiday,Great idea let down by poor execution. Some of the writing here is barely competent. Poor old Jenny Calendar -- one of my favourite characters -- is practically tossed away. Big exception: Nancy Holder's tale -- although that too is hardly the best thing she's done. Quite avoidable.
3,slayergirl2001,I enjoyed the book but it had said that it grappled with Angel becoming a permanent member of the gang but I didn't feel like they really did that. I loved how they made Buffy's vision and why she may have changed after killing the Master. All in all it was pretty good though.
4,For those that need gaps filled between Seasons 1-2 of the show...,"I have to say this is one of my more favorite novels of the Buffyverse. It's set in the time frame between season one and two, when all the characters are on summer vacation. Buffy is in L.A. with her dad throughout the story. Then it also switches back to Sunnydale and deals with the Scoobies side of their summer, including Angel too.It's defiantly a book for those that want those gaps filled in that wasn't fully explained in the show about what really happened to everyone once the Master was killed and how everyone handled it thereafter.A real treat for a true Buffy fan!"
5,A great look into the early years of the state I love,"What a fantastic view into what it was like to be a poineer and what it was like during the formation of western Washington State. I'm from the east side of the state and enjoy our state history but to see an overall picture of what it was like by someone living through it was just a fantastic experience. Much more interesting that just learning ""facts"" about the history of Washington and the early settlers.Great book - even if you're not interested in the state itself!"
3,High and Low Places,"Anyone who has looked at my lists knows that I am fascinated by the Nephilim. I think this story does a nice job of following up on the Peretti-like spiritual warfare fiction, and kept the pace. I don't think it will ever be a classic, but it's staying on my bookshelf."
2,Over rated,"This pamphlet (not a book!) is not as bad as another book I bought on the Graf Spee, Hitler's German aircraft carrier. Amazon does have a medium priced real book (around $50) that goes almost all the way on the WW II German navy. For a few marks more, you can have something you will find out is the real deal."
1,It Does NOT Work,"I live in a very old house with old, dirty pipes. When I don't filter my water, I get a disgusting film on the top of my tea.When I use a pitcher filter (with a NEW filter), there's NO film. In fact, I know it's time to change the filter when the film comes back.The first time I used this filter, right out of the box: lots of film. I've given it a week, and it's just as bad as ever. I'm taking it back today and getting another pitcher. (Which makes me mad, because I'd tossed the only one thinking this would be easier).This filter simply doesn't work. People who say it works probably have decent water to begin with."
4,7 months ago...,"I started using the Brita Disposable Faucet Filtration System on 17 October 2007... and today (16 May 2008) the light just turned red. That's seven months, which equates to about 210 gallons of filtered water, which BTW, I actually measured. I was hoping this filter would last a year, but can't complain about 7 months since I paid under $25. If they could have maintained that cost, I would have considered buying another... but several weeks ago I was checking on prices and discovered this specific filter had skyrocketed to almost $70... along with rumors that it had been discontinued. I was forced to find a cheaper alternative... which I'm not revealing out of fear that product's price will also skyrocket. Good luck in your search for safe clean water."
4,Great for the Price!,"This product is quite wonderful actually. I was surprised, as it was rather inexpensive compared to other filtration systems. It took me only about 3 minutes to get it on, and after I let it run, the water tasted so good! I have high clorinated water with an awful smell, and I tasted none of that! It truly was almost as good as spring water... actually it gave a taste similar to purified water without the mineral aftertaste. I didn't find it bulk but my faucet is rather high and it doesn't take up much room.My only gripe is that the water does indeed come out somewhat slowly so it takes a while to fill up a pitcher or water bottle, but totally worth the extra seconds I have to spend doing it."
5,It's so easy!,This cookbook is great! The recipes taste good and it is as easy as it looks! It takes a load off my mind each night when I go home and don't have to think about what to make for dinner. I have recommended it to several friends!
3,Cookbook,Stated used. It was not in best condition but was able to clean up. Received in a timely manner
1,A Mormon's Comparitive Study,"One look at the chart accompanying this book was enough to tell me this book was not what I had expected. The chart indicated the Mormon church was the ""true"" Christian church and all others including Catholic and Protestant were in apostacy. Look elsewhere unless you adhere to Mormon beliefs."
5,Get the cd!,"The cd is hot, there are some great songs on it, and i think that if u like their single thats out now, u will definitely like the cd."
5,it is great,"these girls(natalie & nichole[nina sky]) can really sing.they touch a lot of different topics, such as party songs(move ya body, holla back, turnin me on), losing a friend(surely missed), and about how if u have a man that treats u wrong then leave(you deserve).i would really recommend it."
5,Nina sky are the best!!,"i brough the cd and trust me IT WAS WORTH MY MONEY!!!!!!!!!!!!!! they are the best out there. They sing hip-hop, reggae, anything interesting! i love them! to anyobody out there Go buy the album because its worth the money. ITS GREAT 5 STARS !!!!"
4,NINA SKY IS OFF THE CHAIN!!!!!!,"Nina Sky Are The Best! They Sure No How To Make A Great CD And I Hope You Buy It Cuz It Is One Of The Best CD's My Favorite Track Is Move Your Body And Any Other Party Song Any Song Of Nina Skys That You Can Play In The Club And Dance To I Liek So Rock On And I Wish NinA Sky The Best (They should come to Petaluma, Ca and perform)Holla At Ya Girl!"
2,I want my money back!!,Track 2 - Move ya body - is the only good song on this CD. Save your money on the album and pick up the CD single instead!!
5,Nina Sky is HOTTT!,The Cd is too hott. This is the best CD released today. I like their hip hop style. I just bought this Cd today and I fell in love with it. I know for sure I will keep it on repeat. So if you aint got it GO GET IT!!!!!!
5,NINA SKY IS LIKE .......WOW,"Nina sky has it all style,beauty,talent, their great ,their cd is also great yea sir.u should check it out!"
3,Hopes Dashed,"Having read all titles in this series - and been frustrated by the last few -- I began this latest with high hopes. Hopes that Carol Ashton would finally begin putting together the experiences and lessons of the past and display some personal insight;. hopes that Carol and Sybil would finally have a real conversation about the nature of their relationship and feelings for each other; hopes that there would be a love scene that didn't read like ""Slam, bang, thank-you-mam;"" hopes that Carol would move from being the thoroughly frustrating character she became as the series progressed. I was much too optimistic (my fault, I admit) and once again had a mystery wherin I knew who the killer was pretty darn quick, .. The promise of the series best titles -- ""Lessons In Murder,""""Fatal Reunion,"" ""Body Guard,"" and ""Inner Circle"" -- has been wasted. I gave No.14 three stars only because of the initial promise it showed."
4,"Read it,and you will catch yourself wishing it wouldn't end!","You just have to read this book.You will appreciate the deft hand used in writing it . The characters are so well drawn and so humanly quirky,that it is easy to forget,they are fictional. The dialogue is especially well done, not phoney or stilted just earthy and very,very funny."
3,Online community is a bit small,"If you are looking to play this game online primarily and don't have a buddy to play with, good luck finding other players to play with."
3,Could be a lot better,"I had a lot of trouble just installing the game. EA told me to shutdown my firewall and anti-virus to install and run the game, something I do not like to do. Many glitches in the startup. I even installed the game on a clean install of XP and ran into problems. The game does not seem to be improving from earlier versions which I own."
4,Tiger Woods 2007 Golf,"To be honest, the game was purchased as a Christmas gift for my brother, however, he has told me that he enjoys it thoroughly, so that is why I gave the ratings above accordingly."
1,The Red King; A Joke,"This book is a Joke within its own right. The unreliable information and facts in the book are all incorrect, this scares a reader and I myself spent a week hiding in th closet out of fear of the Red Fever before I realised it does not exist. This book is extremely useful for lighting fires, propping up tables and using as a small grenade. Victor Kelleher must have a damn nerve in writing this book and in my opinion, and the rest of the ""WE HATE VICTOR KELLEHER SOCIETY"" he should be strung up and poked with kebab sticks. If you were not given this book as a present, and did not steal or find this book, then I will have to assume that you paid real money for this book, in that case you are a damn fool. The content in this book is highly violent, has extreme profanity, horror themes and strong sexual content. Not suitable for persons under 15 years. This is Anne Sanders, signing off."
2,The Red King - Uncovered,"The Red King is yet another unreal, fantasy adventure from Victor Kelleher, with unreal characters in an unreal world, and an amazingly pridictable ending. It tells the story of young acrobat Timkin, who amazingly survived the notorious 'red fever'. She meets up with hippie-like trickster Petie with high hopes of bringing down the Red King, who rules over their land. Now, the only problem with that is you can see the ending from a mile off. Like all his other novels, Vic introduces many wild and wonderful characters, including a monkey who can climb an invisible rope, and a bear who can dance. Methinks you would have to be a fan of Kellahers other novels to appreciate this one. Unfortunately, I am not."
2,Its an ok book but nothing special and very unorigional,"This is the story of a small band of performers who surpass all expectations of the reader to overcome a great evil. Greedy Petie, Sweet Timkin, the mokey Crystal and the bear Bruno travel across the forest-lands to the Red King's fortress. Here they battle all sorts of evil things and their friendship and loyalty to each other is tested. An exciting read with a tricky twist and full of messages. However, it is still unoriginal and the ending lets it down. I recommend it to ages between 10-12 but you should only read it if you have to for school."
3,Not Bad,"Not bad for a $100 complete liquid cooling system, the build quality isn't that good but it'll work.Note: this system is not made for LGA775 systems (P4, Core2Duo and Extreme) so I had to find a way to install it on my system."
4,Shimmering prose and hysterical dialogue,"Consisting of the complimentary novels ""Don't Bite the Sun"" and ""Drinking Sapphire Wine,"" Tanith Lee's hilarious and touching utopian coming-of-age drama tells the story of a far-future society where death is a minor inconvenience at worst, recreational sex-changes are the norm, and--for the sassy, troubled heroine--existential boredom has become an inescapable part of living. Lee's decadent, machine-tended future is a riotous spectacle, and her characters, for all of their quirks, are far more real than many in genre fiction. ""Biting the Sun"" is provocative, colorful and raises deeply serious questions."
1,Disappointing,"I bought the new JoJo Cd and was disappointed. This little girl has an amazing talent, but its not being tapped. All the beats pretty much sound the same, and you can tell she isnt writing any of her own songs. The song material is too mature...and thoughtful for a 13 year old to write. Give this girl 2-3 years and she'll be unstoppable. Britney better watch out fo JoJo..."
3,I actually LIKE Jojo....,"Let me just say I only gave cd 3 stars because I think this girl is trying to be WAY too grown.On the other hand, I really like this cd. I like JoJo's voice, and I like her material. I think that she blazes WAY beyond the scope of being a 13 yr old.She could really do some things in her future with that voice.Stand-outs for me are ""Homeboy"", ""Not that Kind of Girl"", ""Fairytales"", and her cover of SWV's ""Weak""."
2,"voice good, music bad!","this 13 year old has talent, but i dont recommend this album to anyone 16 or older, why? the lyrics are too childish and the sound too pop even britney's first album sounds more mature. i got bored with it. jojo has talent no doubt but ill rather listen to Dido shes so cool. Just let 13 year olds buy it they might relate!"
5,Fabulous,"I love this new jammin' CD from the much succesful newcomer the gorgeous Jojo. She just popped on the scene and already she has been #1 on TRL! Plus the beat and easy to sing lyrics of ""Leave (Get Out)"" are very catchy. Good Luck Jojo!"
1,Jojo by Jojo,"Jojo is an absolutely talentless, young ho wannabe. She tries to be an ""adult"" by singing about relationships, getting larger breasts, and having a powerful chistina-posing voice, but the more she does to be ""cool"", the more it backfires on her. Go back and finish grade school before you write about driving into the club. Hellooooooooooooo you're 13. I don't know how the average review rate for this can be 4.5 stars. Obviously, the reviewers are all from the record company, and are spaming this board with filth.It is wrong for a 13-year old to do this to herself. And here is a message to all middle and high school guys: if you think you can ""get with her"" because she is your age, and it'd be cool to have a celebrety girlfriend, don't. She will fade off into the distance, and will become dirt poor. She already is the ugly, fake thing of yesterday. I don't think that a girl who hasn't completed puberty should be on the radio.Bye!@!"
3,"Not her best album, but worthy.","Now, I do like JoJo. She has very good control over her voice for her age. However, her voice is a bit too young for me. I love singers in secular music who have lush, womanly voices such as Regina Belle, Lara Fabian, Taylor Dayne, Miki Howard, Judy Torres, etc. I think by the time JoJo is in her '20's, her voice will be even better. The song are good, well written. The music style is Urban with Pop leanings. Overall, a good debut album from maturing young vocal talent. I also suggest music from the above mentions vocalists."
3,At least she can sing,"This girl's music is horrible for anyone over 13, but I'm giving her 3 stars only because she's a good vocalist, assuming she doesn't lip-sync. The ""Leave"" song was hilarious."
1,"Jojo is amazing, and there's nothing you can do to stop it!","Jojo is truly one of the most talented young artists out there. And Jayson Jones cannot say anything to bash that. Actually, her music is geared to all people, from even 10 to a person's late 20s! And maybe she has had these feelings she writes about, you're not her best friend. So how would you know? She's expressing her music, and there's no power stronger than that.So, if you're considering buying this album, your money will be well spent. You can look forward to bumpin' rides in your Hummer (or other car ;), loud and fun parties, and a new and excited outlook on the new generation of music! Are you ready!?"
5,JoJo,She is a very good singer and anyone and everyone show buy her album becuase if the first single is that good just think about the whole ablum i am going to by it really soon
3,JoJo,"Jojo hit the charts in 2004 with her pop ballad ""Leave (Get Out)"" This went on to sell many copies, and insured Jojo instant sucess with the tween market. Her second single ""Baby It's You"", also did extremely well in the charts.Jojo is following in the footsteps of other teenage popstars, including Britney Spears and Christina Aguileria. Young people forced to grow up in the spotlight from an early age - perhaps a little too early. At age 13 Jojo is already singing about boyfriends cheating on her, and being 'not that kinda girl'.Despite all this, Jojo is an talented singer with a voice way beyond her years. Tracks that are especially impressive include ""Leave (Get Out)"", ""Weak"", and ""City Lights"".The music is a blend of hip-hop and pop - a combination which Jojo blends nicely together.I must admit I was a little dissapointed in this album, as I though Jojo could have perhaps have done better. ""Leave (Get Out)"" was a fun, catchy song - one that Jojo will find hard to top."
3,out -of- this- world voice...kinda boring songs,"First of all..JoJo has an AMAZING voice! It could be easily mistaken for Beyonce or Ashanti! But she could do better with her amazing voice because the songs on this cd aren't that great. I bought this CD looking for more ""LeAvE GeT OuT!"" & ""BaBy ItS YoU"" but instead I just got a bunch of R&B mixed with pop songs that all sound the same. They're still fun to listen to once in a while and everything but there's nothing special in them, nothing that makes u want to listen to the songs over and over again at one time! But JoJo's voice is sooo good, that still, this cd is quite worth buying. It's a nice break to see a teen star with a good voice for once..not like those actresses turned singers who think they can sing!"
2,Boring,"JoJo is pretty, and ""Leave (Get Out)"" is a really catchy song, but I think the main reason she's famous is because of her young age. JoJo has a lot of vocal talent, and most people wouldn't expect that from a thirteen or fourteen year old. But if JoJo was sixteen and came out with an album this...boring, I don't think it would be as big of a hit. Also, because JoJo is younger, it's easier for younger girls to relate to her (In some ways). Myself, I tried listening to her album, and it was just too much R&B; for me. I would like JoJo much, much better if she sang pop songs. I might even be a big fan. But this CD just bored me. I get bored easily with slow songs, and that's pretty much all this album is. ""Leave (Get Out)"" is the only song with feeling, and good music. I think there could have been more of a variety of songs on this album, and I hope JoJo will be around long enough to make a better follow-up album.This review was brought to you by,GMM (Gold Mew Mew)"
5,"JOJO""S CD IS AWESOME",JOJO is an incredible singer and is really hot. Her CD kicks ass. she did such a great job on this CD. There are great songs and a plus is she has a great voice. She is the emerging artist and she will beat brittney and christina in the near future.
2,JoJo Has A Long Way To GoGo,"The other day one of my friends asked me, ""Who is better: Joss Stone or JoJo?"" and I said,""JoJo, no doubt! Do you know when Jodeci is going to get back together?"" and my friend responded,""No, yo! Not that JoJo! Little 13 year old JoJo!"" I had no idea who the heck she was talking about until today. Now that I know who JoJo is, I can say that JoJo is better than Joss Stone. HOWEVER, JoJo is boring. I mean, the girl can sing but she needs to do 3 things: 1) Stop the screetching 2) Stop trying to grow up so fast and 3) Find a style of her own. Like I said before, she can sing but this CD gets boring because it's nothing that you haven't heard before lately on FM radio. Anyone can sing those songs. The few tracks that I like are ""The Happy Song"" and ""Keep on Keepin' On."" JoJo's remake of SWV's ""Weak"" was alright, but it wasn't necessary. Other than that, this CD isn't worth writing home about. It's just aight."
4,JoJo...She's good,When i first saw tha video for Leave (Get Out)...i was like ehh another britney wannabe...and i was sittin there thinkin this girls at least 16 or 17...nonetheless tha song got stuck in my head and i had to download it...after a play or two...i LOVED tha song...so i started reading up on jojo and found out she was 13..i was so shocked and amazed...this girl is only 13 and her voice is AMAZING!! anyways i got more of her songs...there are alotta good songs on her cd ..i reccomend it she's good forget tha fact that shes 13 and tha subject of her music..its good!
5,JoJo's CD is DA BOMB!!!!,Oh my GOSH!!! This CD is the best...I have the cd right now playing on repeat..I got it yesterday at 10:00 when Best Buy opened and i was the first person in line to get it and leave with it. I can't believe how great of a singer she is. ONLY 13!! AMAZING voice. I would definitly recommend buying this CD!!
5,JoJo,This album is absoulutley amazing. She is so young and has more pontential than any other artist out right now in my mind. This album is a great buy.
3,Is the music industry this desperate now?,"This girl is only thirteen. She shouldn't be singing the things she sings in her songs. I'm sure she's never felt any of those emotions. She has a good voice, but she's so young. Her music just comes out hollow."
3,Pretty good start for a newcomer....,"The album was ok.My favorites are Homeboy,Use my shoulder, and the happy song, the rest are common pop/rnb tunes...."
5,~*~JOJO THIS IS HOT~*~,I LIKE YOUR NEW CD AND IT IS REALLY GOOD AND I LIKE IT SO MUCH THAT I KEEP LISTENING TO TRACK 5 OVER AND OVER AGAIN.
5,Jojo,"This may be Jojo's first album, but it's great! The songs are great and I think most people can find something to Love about it! This is my favorite album ever!"
5,JoJo is on fiyah!,Listening to this cd you would never guess this artist was 13 years old. Her songs carry such a personal note and can connect with everyone. JoJo is incredibly talented and this album is a showcase of that. EVERYONE GO GET IT!!!!!!
5,daisy nose ring,"I am very pleased with the daisy nose ring. I have started a collection and I think, by far, this one is a favorite! Reasonably priced and just the right size."
4,Meh.,"I feel most of this book is pretty simple and really just leads you to buy the next book. Which after doing so, I realized that many topics are revisted in each additional book. I would prefer if they were all combined and then the price increased to reflect this. Sort of lame having to buy and then pay taxes on three separate short books."
3,"Really, Really Basic Information","This is a very basic guide to masturbation. It is best for someone who has very little experience with masturbation or has never given it much thought or tried less traditional methods, toys, etc. I was disappointed in how basic the book was, and suspect that others who are open sexually will find themselves feeling the same way. The book is probably good for a beginner of any age, but should be passed over by more experienced readers."
5,Tickled My Fancy,Author Sadie Allison knows her stuff. I couldn't put this book down! There are so many techniques on self-pleasure that I never knew. She also provides us with different methods of arosal and stimulation. Take my advice and pick up this book. You will thank me for it.
5,A sweet and informative book about self-pleasure.,"I was pleasantly surprised at how well this book was put together. It's easy to read and there are lots of fun, helpful illustrations. I am a 36 year old woman in the mid-west and did not grow up feeling comfortable about sexuality. So I was looking to learn more about my body, and different self-pleasuring techniques. And that's exactly what Tickle Your Fancy taught me. I'm glad this book is available-it helped me open up a great deal. I'd recommend it to any woman, no matter what your age (don't feel bad-there are still many of us who never learned how to do this on our own!)."
3,Decent strap,"The strap works fine but the leather is kind of cheap looking. Also, I had to trim down the cradle straps to fit between the brackets on my banjo. I do like the adjustability that it offers and it is very comfortable to wear."
5,Exquisite Book,"Drum, Chavi, Drum is a bilingual book for all ages. Mayra L. Dole, the author, has an exquisite, rythmical lyrical-prose style that is so vivid, so alive, so real and urgent, that you cannot help but be transported into her lively Cuban culture and come out dying to read anything she has ever written. This book is a gem. It touches upon many delicate subjects in lower working-class Latino cultures in an upbeat, fun way. Kids will fall in love with Chavi, her attitude toward life and the way she transforms her feelings into pure rythym. A must buy. The art work is expressive and vibrant. I highly recommend this book."
1,My son got hurt,The basketball hoop isn't very sturdy and my 10 month old son leaned on it and came crashing down and cut his eyelid. Very disappointed. This was my son's first and last Little Tikes toy
2,Not exactly what I expected,"The toy doesn't do too much, and its very light weight. My 9 month old pulls on the basketball rim and it tumbles over, I'm still trying to find the purpose of the t-ball stand, it doesn't do anything at all, its hard to get it to spin when you hit it with the bat. My son likes the football because when you grab it, it spins around and makes a lot of noise. I'm pretty sure there are other toys out there sports related with some type of educational value. Although it does cheer when you score a goal and it counts your shots."
3,Not worth it's hype,"This was a gift for my son on his 1st bday, he played with it quite a bit for a few days, but quickly lost interest. The football is a joke, all it does is spin, and he doesn't even mess with it. He loved the basketball goal, but he would chase the ball with his hand through the basket and get his arm caught in it. I'd have to be close by everytime he played with it. I don't recommend this toy....it's collecting dust waiting for our next yard sale."
3,My son likes this toy...,"My one and a half year old son likes this toy. I think it has good and bad points. I like it because the volume of the music is not as loud as some of his other toys. I also like it because he seems interested in it. I don not like it because it is so short, I thought it would be taller than it is. I also dont like it because the little lever that is inside the ""net"" gets stuck all the time and it frustrates my son. I am onot sure why it gets stuck and I havent tried to spray anything on it or send it back."
4,SPOILER ALERT,"I watched a kid perform a portion of this book at the National Championship for Speech and Debate sometime ago, and I was intrigued by the story so I bought the book. I had no idea it was as short as it was, but it did give a more complete story (compared to the 10 minute Dramatic Interpretation). I will tell you right now that the ending is like ""Inception"" - it leaves you hanging!!! So if you hate those kinds of stories where the ending is unresolved, DO NOT READ THIS BOOK. It'll leave you extremely frustrated!"
1,Unacceptable,"I am being forced to read this book for my senior year. After starting it, I find it distasteful and deffinetly not one of my favorite books. Yes, I realize that in the end we should all feel sad and sorry for the author and yah good story. But the thing I find unacceptable is the language used and some what of what he sees, portrayed to us. This was NOT necessary for this book. What a dirty little kid. Why would I want to read a book about a dirty kid? I could just walk down my school hallway if I wanted to find such vulgor. The book would be much better if the distasteful language was taken out."
4,neutral,"Stuck in neutral is a excellent book. I would have givgen it 5 stars but the whole time your on the edge of your seat waiting for that story changing moment, and nothing happens, but Trueman does a great job of giving you a vicarious expierence with a 14 year old boy who cant move a muscle in his entire body. the boy, Sean, thinks hes goin to get muredered by his father and Truemen writes about every thing that goes through his dad, and evn though he knows his father wants to kill him, no one can hear his crys of help!"
1,hated it,"I have cerebral palsy and, until the last pages, I mostly enjoyed this book; although I thought Shaun's genius and so on was rather unlikely - total recall *and* out-of-body experience? Come on, Mr Trueman ... I saw somewhere that you said children always believe Shaun's still alive because he's narrating the book. But I'm old enough to have learnt the concept of the unreliable narrator. If he's trapped inside that body how come he's writing? If he can have an out-of-body experience when he's alive, why not when he's dead? No, Mr Trueman, no. Why do disabled characters in fiction always have to have some stunning compensatory ability? Why can't they be allowed to get past the last page? Could it be because the able-bodied world would rather they weren't there ...?"
3,stuck in neutral,"I thought that this book was a pretty good book, although in some spots it became kind of boring. I think that people who kind of like slow suspense stories shoud read this book. I like the fact that the main character, Shawn, is not able to talk or move at all. This makes it more exciting to know that he can not communicate with any body to tell them that he thinks that his dad is trying to kill him."
4,Stuck in neutral,"Shawn McDanel is a 14 year old that has disabilities he cant talk,walk,and he cant control any of his muscels. He has a sister Cindy that is 16 and a brother that is 17. He has seizures every once in awhile unexpectidly. When he has seizures hes sees different colors like blue and red. He loves his seizures and he thinks its not all that painful. He thinks his dad wants to kill him. His dad left the family when he was young because he couldnt take it any longer but he still comes to see him and the family. It is a really good book and you will be surprised in what happens at the end."
1,I MISS HEADON MIGRAINE...This doesn't compare.,"I was really upset at the size of this. Smaller than my pinky finger and the ball barely rolls out anything. I loved Headon Migraine and since it's out, I tried this. No help at all..I'd have to use the entire bottle. Save your $7 and rub on Vicks Vapor Rub."
2,didn't work at all,"I got this for a friend who gets lots of headaches from stress. Another friend recommended it so I went ahead and ordered it (kind of expensive, considering the size and simple ingredients). It did absolutely nothing for him. Yes, I was disappointed, but that's life."
3,Are you sensitive to smells?,"I read the reviews here and thought, 'wow, sounds like something I should try.' After all, I take so much ibuprofen that I'm concerned for my liver.Well, as it turns out, the peppermint oil and lavender oil in this actually make me feel more sick. Many of us get nauseated when we have a migraine, and odors of any kind make it worse.I am not against natural oils or natural products that help people, but I'm not going to use this when I feel a migraine coming on because the smell is strong."
3,"Not bad, not great",It helps more or less if your headache/migraine is not too strong. The mint odor was bothersome but it goes away after some minutes. I personally find Head on so much better.
3,"Interesting bits, but somewhat self-serving",I enjoyed the hole-by-hole recounting of Mickelson's first Masters win but the personal narratives seemed a little self-serving. I think Mickelson is a stand-up guy and believe he does a lot of good for a lot of people but the life-stories read like a fairy-tale and I just started skipping past them to get to the next hole. There are better books about golf personalities and I am still looking for one on Lefty.
3,An interesting look at Buddhist temples in America.,"Numrich takes a look at two prominent immigrant Buddhist temples. While his views are interesting, he never really seems to get inside the true nature of the temples or their congregations. Also, he always seems to be looking in from an outsider's point of view, not being of either temple's primary ethnic makeup. Numrich doesn't really probe into truly examining the immigrants' point of view, depending instead on many surveys, figures, and tables.I read this book because I am an Asian American member of one of the two temples studied and wanted to see how it was represented. It's an interesting viewpoint and raises worthy issues but probably should not be taken as an authoritative view on Buddhism in America or the Asian immigrant experience."
2,Didn't Quite Hook Me,"Three On A Meathook is yet another horror movie based on real life serial killer Ed Gein. And it's not one of the best. It lacks the expert direction that Alfred Hitchcock brought to Psycho, and it lacks crazed horror of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. What Three On A Meathook is, is a fairly disjointed slasher film. Both the acting and direction are spotty overall. The only actor that is any good really is the man who played Billy. I will say that the first twenty minutes and the last ten minutes of Three On A Meathook are pretty good, but everything in between is boring and hard to sit through. I'd avoid if I were you, unless you're like me and have seen all of the good slashers out there."
4,Good boots,"Good boots. I'm a size 9 and ordered size 9 (wasn't sure if size 9 shoe meant I needed a larger size boot, but it doesn't - order the boot size that is your shoe size.) They are totally waterproof. Reasonably comfortable, considering what they are. The left heel is a little loose fitting and slips a bit with each step, so I'm still using my boots for longer treks, but these are fine for covering my feet walking to the subway with work shoes on."
3,Has some good info but........,"This does do a decent job of covering the basics of tig welding as has good info in it if you have never done it before but it really, needs to be updated! Poor illustrations and print quality and lacking depth of knowledge and current information."
3,Need better bolts,"These tie downs are very useful and should be easy to install but the bolts they come with are some of the cheapest things I have ever seen. I had 2 bolts that broke when tightening them. This is a bad place to cut corners and try to save money. Other than that, they work great, I'm just frustrated that i had to go the hardware store to get stronger bolts."
1,Bolts are defective,"Save your money, they are impossible to secure with out breaking bolts.Product looks great but really needs better attachments."
2,Not what I expected for a film. Love the Bible Series but this was different,Jacob and Joseph. This is a film and not in the Bible series. WAnted it to be closer to the story of the Bible.
2,Forced myself to finish this,"Well, having given up on Shadow several years ago,and having been told that people often gave upon these books and loved them on a second attempt,I am making a second attempt. I have finished Shadowand Claw, and so far am not having anything resemblinga good time.I'm not that bothered by the antique vocabulary. I'm justnot sure that I care what happens to Severian or indeedanyone else in the story. I enjoyed Jack Vance's ""Eyes ofthe Overworld"" much more - and that has a somewhatsimilar setting and somewhat similar vocab.I will read Sword and Citadel, but whilst it's possiblethat they will make me re-evaluate events in books 1and 2 I can't see myself deciding after 3&4 that1&2 were, in retrospect, brilliant fun.In particular, Dr Talos' play near the end of book 2is something I skipped faster and faster, like romancescenes in a Doc Smith book. Eeeagh."
2,Wolfe overrated,"When I saw that this book got such great reviews I decided to buy it - big mistake! I feel obligated to write a review to others so that they can avoid the same mistake. In all fairness some of the reviews which rated this book as great did so with the qualification that the style is difficult. This is an understatement - the characters are boring and the story is confusing. The direction is never clear, characters come and go with no overall theme and you never get any strong feeling for the main character (one way or the other). I got through the whole book and even tried to start book#3 in the series but could see it going nowhere and finally decided to put myself out of my misery and just quit. I would advice you to avoid making the same mistake and take a pass on this series.Recommend :Any Jack Vance novel - especially Demon Princes, Night Lamp, Dying Earth, LyonnesseStephen King's Dark Tower series"
1,hated it,This book felt childish to me. I really didn't like it. From the story to the writing it was just lacking.
2,Tedious,"The world he creates is quite interesting but there are no characters to flesh it out. The main character falls in love with every single women character with no reason what so ever. His development of love is like a child smashing to action figures together while saying ""love"". You get less description about the women than one would get before going on a blind date. I suppose you are supposed to get some idea about their personality from the few short things they say but it does nothing for their character.Also, the author describes every dream and thought with great detail but passes over the interesting parts of the story.Have you ever met someone that really liked the sound of their own voice? That is the story teller.If you like a story where something, anything, happens. Don't read this book."
2,A Little less then okay,"This book was crafted well, and beuatifly written, but focased so much on detail it lost the overall meaning. The intresting parts of the plot are done quikly and the ""inbetweens"" are long and boring. If you like every day life, this is the book for you"
3,"Not very uplifting, but ok","I was looking for a book that made me feel really good about myself and that would help me to accept my weight. It didn't really do that though. It was not uplifting and I did not feel any better about myself after. It did have a lot of good and interesting history and information though. It is definitely not sweet and sappy let's feel good about ourselves book. It's a very frank and realistic book, which may be right for some. If I had the choice again, I would only buy it if it were a really good deal. For example, if it were available used for less than a dollar or two."
5,"If you want the music, listen to the music.","For all the people complaining that this book doesn't delve enough into the music of Chet Baker, this is a biography, not a music criticism. If you want to hear the music, put on a record or a CD and listen. If you want to read about the music, read a music criticism or reviews of his records. If you want a biography, this is it."
3,Not Quite What Was Expected,"As mentioned in the title, this book was not quite what was expected. The introduction by Childress was equivalent in length to Hapgood's portion, and contained little new information. It also contained some misinformation about the Zuiyo-maru carcass.As for Hapgood's portion, a more complete analysis of the mystery figures was expected. The presentation was quite generic with few specific examples of the reasoning behind his belief thst dinosaurs survived until recently."
1,One word: Flintstones,"The authors rely quite a bit on pictures drawn by an ancient culture, and not enough on physical evidence. If a future civilization were to discover a picture of the Flintstones, with both human and dinosaur characters, a similar book might be written claiming that dinosaurs lived in our time."
2,The weakest book in the weakest series,"As a lover of Griffin's books, I was very dissapointed in this installment of the Badge of Honor Series. Unfortuneatly, Griffin understands the mindsets and motives of cops, soldiers, and marines much better than he does criminals. The animal rights activist turned vicious urban terrorist villain is not a believable character. You could skip this one and not have missed a thing."
4,Great....but....,The Jove edition /December 1998 is missing pp. 256-257. In its place are pp. 356-357. I fooud this annoying.
2,A tale of astounding escapades & unpredictable characters,"Under the shadow of notorious newspaper titans Joseph Pulitzer and William Randolph Hearst lurks the astonishing story of their reporters in the field. Harry Scovel, Stephen Crane, Cora Taylor, Richard Harding Davis, and James Creelman, among others, risked their lives to ""get the story"" in Cuba during its struggle for independence, some of them even becoming spies duuring the Spanish-American War.A tale of astounding escapades, unpredictable characters, wit, humor, and tragedy, The Yellow Kids shows that it was often editors and publishers in New York who added the ""yellow"" to journalism."
4,Great results,"I have used numerous top coats, and this one is excellent. It gives the nails a very hard, slick, shiny finish and extends the life of your manicure. If you don't prep your nails correctly, and if you apply too many coats of polish without sufficient drying time between them, it doesnt matter what top coat you use because your manicure will not last. One coat of this product seems to be sufficient, and it works great."
1,HORRIBLE,"Chips within hours of putting it on. I used it as a topcoat and within a few hours my nails were cracked and chipped. I used it the next day by itself and it chipped within an hour of putting it on. It dries quick and is really thick and shiny, but it chips like crazy and causes polish to chip worse than it would without a top coat. Don't waste your money!"
1,Absolutely useless,This product is terrible. My polish chipped faster than it would have without any topcoat at all. Total waste of money.
1,GARBAGE!!!,"I don't usually write reviews, but this product is so bad I felt I needed to warn others. What the other reviewers said about cracking and shattering polish is true. In less than a day, your manicure is ruined because most of the polish has flaked off. I didn't get this off Amazon, I purchased at a local superstore... too bad I didn't check these reviews first. This top coat is straight GARBAGE!!! Don't buy!"
1,ruined my 30 buck manicure!,"i wish i read these reviews before buying it from the drugstore. i mean, who doesnt love a glossy acrylic finish?DO NOT BUY THIS. Sally Hanson must be crazy to even put this on the market. it chips, cracks, peels, everything you wish to avoid. yes it looks nice and glossy, but this products sucks. period.I rarely go for manis and pedis because its such a luxury, and i wanted to preserve whatever i paid for, but now my nails are ruined!very, very angry."
1,Terrible product,"I bought this product to protect my nail polish from chipping and it did everything but that. One some nails, the polish peeled all the way off, on other nails, there was chipping at the tips and with other nails, there was even chipping along my cuticles. I'm so disappointed with Sally Hansen's No Chip Acrylic Top Coat. I don't recommend this product; it's a waste of money."
1,Terrible!,This has been a time a money waster! I've tried it several times and every time it chips my nail polish within the same day. I won't be buying this again.
1,worst Sally Hansen product,"Sally Hansen No Chip Acrylic Top Coat is definitely the worst Hansen product I've tried and may be the worst nail product I've ever used. I am on my third application, shaking the bottle gently and applying -- once on nude clean nails and twice over nail polish. In each instance, the No Chip cracked and flaked in one day. I used polish remover and tried again. I'm finally doing what I haven't done before...I'm taking this stuff back to the store and politely asking for a refund. I think if more ladies do this, instead of feeling ashamed at buying a useless product, we would end up with better products (money talks, girls)!"
1,The worst!!,The other reviews are dead on!! Don't buy this stuff unless you like the chipped polish look. It looks sooo good right after you apply then an hour later it's half gone.
5,Must have for construction,"This package has proven extremely useful to be in constructing a barn, workshop, and associated fields. This summer I used the level extensively for digging and installing an inground pool. We also constructed a retaining wall and associated paver patio. The guys working with me complained about the loud beeping but overall, we couldn't have completed the work without the level. If you're planning on building anything that needs to be level, invest in this laser level package. It's everything you'll need and you'll be pleased with the results."
1,FAKE Democracy Propaganda Film,"I saw the film ""Without the King"". Question... In Africa the bread basket of the world, if there is no war/military conflict in one of the countries there, then how can a person be starving to death as some of the ""paid rebels"" in this fake democracy propaganda film falsely claim? We are smart enough to know that since these ""paid trouble makers"" can make time to produce and buy their own beer then they can take that same energy and grow some food in that very rich land of theirs. I mean think about it, who would really hate on a country that honors virgins and chastity? We know who, a people whose countries honor homos and whores instead.This fake Doc is a disgrace to true film making!"
5,Eric Lindell Rules!!!!,"The man and his band should/will be playing big venues real soon. Solid rock-n-roll laced with the blues and spiced from the Bayou. Well, that might be a bit corny, but the man is good.Top to bottom this is an excellent compilation of his small-label stuff. Some favorites are Give It Time, Sunny Daze, It Won't Be Long, and Casanova. I only wish they had included It's a Drag...but you can find that in his live recordings available at jazzfestlive.com.Glad to see he is signed with a big label, but will miss his dates at the Forestville Club. It you are at the NO Jazz Fest, be sure to check him out!"
1,Did not receive this!!,"No Rudyard Kipling book made it as a down load to my Kindle. I got the bill for all of them, tho."
4,My 100-word book review,"Consider Her Ways is the classic John Wyndham novella depicting a future society where all men have gone the way of the dodo, and very grim and ant-like it is too. Would an all-female world really be so regimented? Maybe not, but Wyndham's dystopian take on this subject is compelling. The other five stories in this volume are rather a mixed bag, the best of them dealing with time travel and alternative dimensions. After reading these I wondered why the author never actually wrote a full-length time travel novel, although having said that, the short story formula works exceedingly well."
3,Just ok,My boys (3 & 1) love dinosaurs. Someone gave this to my 3 year old for his birthday. He thought it was really cool to put all his dinos in one place and then car it around. It is perfect for the car on long road trips. Fits right between our two carseats. It has been 4 months and the sides will not stay up. It collapses in every different direction even with the sides zipped and the lid will not stay on. It is about to go in the trash. Over priced in my opinion. I might pay $5 for it.
5,AWESOME,The best thing I found for my grandson to keep all his dinosaurs in. Plus it is a mat he can play on as well! PERFECT!!!!
4,Neat-Oh! is neat-oh!,"Good toy for my little brother. Excellent to teach him how to organize his toy messes. Put in his words: ""DINO BLAST!!!"""
3,Could do without,I bought this for my 3 year old son to keep all his dinosaurs in and for something for him to play with them on. He played with his dinosaurs on it for the first day but then lost interest in it. So it is pretty much just used to store his dinosaurs in.
3,Great design but wish the materials were heavier duty,"This is a brilliant design (play mat/storage box). However, I don't see why it couldn't be more heavily constructed. The box top is a bit squishy and floppy. I can already tell the entire box will get weak and bendy and not hold up well to wear.""Dear, Neat-Oh Production Team, If you start making a better build product I would happily pay a bit more money for it. In fact, I'd love to have several of these boxes, ONLY IF they are constructed with more resilience in mind. Thank you for your consideration of this matter."""
3,Nice but a lot of work,"Nice concept, but its a lot of work to turn it into a playmat then back to a box again."
3,Decent workout,"I have both Tae Bo and ""Kick it"" by Janis Saefell, and I definately prefer those two to this Video. I wasn't that stimulating. The degree of difficulty was a C+. I don't know why it got such great reviews."
3,"Good, but please note it's a YA book","This is an informal, chatty, biography of Elizabeth Blackwell, the first woman in America to become a doctor. For a young reader it's probably just right as an inspiring read. However, while there's a good deal of information it's sometimes hard to extract from the text, so it would not be the best choice for say, facts for a paper. For an adult reader the book is still interesting, but some of the liberties the author takes are annoying - I.e. a lot of the book is written from inside Dr. Blackwell's head. Worth reading if you run into a copy."
4,Adult Toys,"Great book to get you familiar with all sorts of adult toys, what they are for and how to use them."
4,Really edifying movie,"The Perfect Stranger portrays the Lord Jesus Christ in a way that is strange to me; however, the ""heart"" and message of it sought to answer the cries of many hurting people who need to see God's hand at work in their lives. I liked the way the actor playing the Lord subtly slipped in his knowledge of Nikki's past experiences, and only when it was necessary to accomplish something specific. He didn't change the wine into water, as she requested. He only wanted to reach into her heart and draw her to come in and dine with him, to accept the gift Christ paid for with His very life. There may have been some license taken, but I did not see any contradiction of Scripture. There was a clear desire to minister to people seeking God. This movie was a blessing to me and I will order it to show to my family."
4,Diner with the Perfect Stranger - Wow,This movie was a little slow getting started but when it kicked in I was utterly enchanted. I imagined myself talking with Jesus. What would I want to know? I thought of so many people who have questions but don't have good answers. Loved the movie.
1,This movie doesn't have closed caption!,"Amazon.com entered under product details that this movie has closed caption. They were wrong. This movie doesn't have closed caption! I was looking forward to watch it and I was disappointed when it didn't have it. So, I will borrow a book from the library instead!Updated 6/16/06I just finished the book. It's very good! It's something I wanted to read again and again for refreshment as well as reminder of the truth about Jesus. At first I was confused because Nikki in the movie is a male in the book (Nick). The movie producer must have changed the gender for better sell?"
4,Excellent movie that answers pointed questions,"This film created a sense of the ""real"". No speculations or fantasies but real questions and real answers. I showed it to my eight grade youth group at church. Some ""got it"", the rest had silly remarks to make so it probably would have been best to show it to the high school aged kids."
5,The best so far!!!,"by far this is one of the best evangelistic films we have ever come across. excellently done, and more importantly, annointed. i am sure this will be used by many believers to win their friends and family to the Lord. for all those who have a burden to win the lost, here is a great tool for you to share the good news in a non-religious way! it is a must see!"
4,The essence of this movie is profound.,"When I first saw this movie I loved it but disagreed with some issues based on my spiritual insights, however, the essence of this movie which I will not reveal triggered deep emotions inside me which still come up when I think about the film. The actress played a convincing role."
1,WHAT A BIG DISAPPOINTMENT!!!,"This movie had a lot of great actresses/ actors but, the movie sucked!! Their are some funny parts but mostly stupid, Sandra's character was extremely desperate. I usually like her character; not this time!! WHAT A BIG DISAPPOINTMENT!!!"
5,You don't want to put it down after you start it!!!!!,This is a great book because it keeps you informed threw many diffrent point of views. You can also take the book in many diffrent ways and still be an awsome book. My suggestion is to read the last 2 chapters first. It doesn't spoil the book but it makes more scince.
5,After the First Death,"I read this book with high school sophomores, and they loved it. While the content is harsh, there are valuable lessons to be learned from it. We examined family relationships, cultures, and patriotism, and we had some wonderful lessons on comparing similiarities among Miro, Kate, and Ben. The book itself is filled with figurative language. I had students identify some of the similies used. The students were eager to read, and this really thrilled me. Some innocent people do die in this novel, but, as other reviewers have already said, this makes the book true to life."
2,Can't say I liked it!,I guess my heart wasn't in it when I read the book. It was so boring I had to struggle to finish it and the budding sexuality of the teenage characters is but just a pathetic attempt to draw the reader's attentions. What story? Hardly interesting at all.
4,"briefly confusing, but incredible","who was the first death? was mark crazy? was it fair that he was expected to betray his country? was miro put off at the fact that the man he was destined to kill turned out to be a woman? all good questions, all aroused by this book.though it may have been graphic at times, this is a thriller that realizes many of our own worse fears...and that is what makes robert cormier such an excellent author."
2,poor sound quality,"This is a great product for kids, but for an adult looking for good sound quality this is not it. It sounds very tinny."
5,Excellent rock,The music was ahead of it's time. I have been searching for the album tape or cd for years. I loned my album out and it did not come home. Get it and you'll see it's worth it!
5,Two epic tales - with a twist,"This collection of two books by Robert Asprin were a few of my favorites. Without giving the book away, let me tell you that this book doesn't disappoint in comparisson to his earlier books. The characters still deliver the same impact they did in his past books and they keep the same personalitiesThe plotline twists and weaves and I love how all the books seem to follow the pattern that as soon as one problem is solved, a whole new set of problems emerge. This book promises to be a delightful sequel to the already memorable series of books."
4,wow,"My daughter in law purchased this item for me from Amazon. I'm a knitter and this was to help ease my carpal tunnel.Pro's: very easy to use, you can knit a scarf, in a couple hours. Unlike regular knitting, changing colors is a breeze on these. My stripes are perfect. Hard to drop a stitch on these either.Anyone, that has had problems learning to knit could really use this in a couple hours.Con's: Like others have said the instruction manual is awful. You need to check out u-tube and provo craft to find more patterns.All in all, this has been a great gift. I've made scarfs, panels for afghans, and a bumble bee toy for my granddaughter. You do not need to know how to knit.You will have to find instruction on the internet. And please buy a crochet hook it helps when you need to finish an item."
5,Quick and excellent intro to heraldry,"Pastoureau has managed to fit in a little book enough information about heraldry to get the novice interested in this noble art.Naturally, it does not go into the same level of detail as Boutell's Heraldry and it is not intended to.If you have a passing interest in heraldry, coats of arms, etc. but don't know much about it, this is your starter book.If you want to introduce heraldry to teenagers, this is a perfect book.If you are an ""old hand"" in heraldry, this will be a quick and very enjoyable read."
4,Nice product.,"I've been using this set for 4 months now and so far so good. Nice fabric, nicely finished and it's good for its purpose. Price is very reasonable. No complaints!"
5,Lionel is back!,"I've been a huge Richie fan for years and have adored his previous work. I just got this SACD last week and it was worth every penny! The standard cd audio mix does not even compare to the 5.1 surround sacd mix. I first played the cd audio version and I must say the sound quality was somewhat dull and at times even sounded quite bad in certain tracks, especially ""time of our life"". But then when I popped the disc into my SACD player, the experience was breathtaking. All 13 songs sounded excellent in 5.1 surround, with ""do ya"" and ""heaven"" standing out. There are not fillers in this album, every track was beautiful and had the trademark richie sounds in them. I enjoyed this album immensely and the 5.1 surround program simply made this wonderful album even better. A must buy, even if you're new to Richie's music, this is great!"
4,Interesting Overview,"This was a very good book. It focuses more on the life of the Beothuk people rather than the history of their interaction with the European Settlers of Newfoundland, although that sad part of history is also represented. The artwork was quite well done. The book is more of an overview than an extremely detailed account. I was able to get a good picture of just how well the Beothuk had adapted to and prospered in a hostile environment. The tragic story of their extinction is presented from a neutral point of view."
3,Good Java Design Book,"Overall, this book does a decent job of explaining good design techniques to the programmer who is already familiar with Java. There are plenty of code examples, along with UML diagrams to help explain the designs that are presented. There's even an appendix on UML for those unfamiliar with the modeling language.There are some flaws in this book, however. The book is not updated for Java 2, and is therefore rapidly becoming obsolete. Additionally, a significant number of typos and inconsistent use of terms clouds the already difficult subject matter. Especially bad is the discussion of the Cloneable interface, in which the authors state that different compilers treat Cloneable classes differently, but do not explain what the correct behavior is according to the Java Language Specification or how to work around these compiler problems.There is some good material in the book, but in my opinion not enough of it and too many problems in the presentation, to justify the cover price."
5,Quick Read - Excellent Data,"A good intro to some advanced topics, class loading, patterns, etc. Reads very quick and well written."
4,Something new for Darwin fans,"Those who have already read all current Darwin biographies, should give this book a try. Mr. McDonald uses familiar facts in an entirely new way to create a convincing and sometimes moving novel. Unfortunately, the book doesn't make sufficiently clear why natural selection was such a threathening concept to dissenters, let alone Victorians in general. If you like the book, I would recommend reading ""The Discovery of Slowness"" by Sten Nadolny, too."
3,Would be better if it sat flush,"I bought this for my bathroom so my 2 year old could brush her teeth and wash her hands at the sink. It seems very sturdy and well made, but it's designed in such a way that it doesn't sit flush against my sink cabinet and I worried about that. We've moved it downstairs and she loves using it to sit and stand on when she's using her easel. All in all, not bad for the price, but I'd love if the back of it was straight up and down so it could be flush to the surface you're putting it against."
5,KidKraft Two Step Stool,"Exactly what I was looking for! Great step stool. I have two year old twins and my boy has always been in the 10th percentile. This step stool was tall enough for him to reach the sink. After visiting KidKraft's website, I found that this stool is a few inches taller than than the one with the storage option, so I opted for this one instead. That was a good call because a few inches shorter and I don't know if he would have been able to wash his own hands. I have other KidKraft items and they have held up very will with my twins."
4,Good Stool -- with a few user upgrades,"Purchased this stool for our 2 year old son to reach the bathroom sink. We try to buy wood products and toys whenever suitable, to cut down on the amount of plastic in our home. This stool is sturdy and well made. We made two improvements on it once it arrived. 1) Added non-skid adhesive pads to the bottom of it. This was a ""must do"". Our bathroom has a linoleum floor, and the stool definitely could slide out from under our son if he leaned forward at the right angle. 2) Added felt pads, one on each side, to the places where the stool touched / contacted our bathroom under-sink cabinets.The user improvements took a total of 15 minutes to shop for, and another 10 to 15 minutes to install. Very easy. We did a lot of stool shopping, and I'm glad we got this one. Gave four instead of five stars, since the product should probably come with non-skid pads, since it could be a safety issue."
4,Kids 2 step wood stool.,"We like the stool. It seems sturdy. It was not difficult to assemble, however, the holes did not lign up so we had to drill new holes."
5,"good quality, easy to put together",I like kidkraft. Haven't had problems with any of their products so far. This is the 2nd kidskraft stool I've bought. The other one has held up fine for a year. Takes maybe 15 minutes to put together. Very sturdy and good price.
5,Great stepstool for young toddler .... 2 steps,I needed a step stool that was just plain when I redecorated my daughers bathroom and this works just fine. No stupid cartoon characters all over it. I like the lip on the edge at the top ... my daughter slid off the other stool I had that didn't have a lip. Also it has nice rounded corners instead of sharp jagged edges. It's hard to find something like this in stores so this is something I am happy with.
4,Use caution,"I'm tutoring a student for the GED test. We are going through each lesson together, so I am explaining and correcting each lesson. We just started the book and I have already found two errors. One is a misspelled word, ""Huntsville"" spelled ""Hunstville"", not so serious. But in one lesson about parts of speech, the word ""when"" is printed when it should be ""went"". That could throw someone off. We will continue to use the book with caution."
2,Not for me.,"I didn't like it at all. Too much singing and bad acting. The storyline was alright, but I wasn't feeling this one. Good thing my movie pass covered it, otherwise I would have been upset the $4 was gone...but if you're into the whole church movie scene then you'll enjoy it. But still, the acting was BAD. I'm filing it away as another BBM...."
4,Not Bad,"I couldn't wait to go see this movie at the movie theater. Although it was good, I thought it could've been better in order for me to give it 5 stars. Boris Kodjoe of course was looking debonair( <--- I think I spelled it right). But that wasn't the only reason. I enjoy good down home foot stomping gospel music and that's exactly what was played. So that was definitely a plus for me. This will definitely be added to my DVD collection."
4,So how often do we get a decent Christain film?,"I'm not sure where the 1-3 star crowd is coming from on this one. Nit-picking this film is missing the point. In an age where Hollywood is cranking out banal trash by the truckload and torture-porn flicks are released on Christmas, this was a refreshing and uplifting change of pace. Yes, it wasn't big-budget. Yes, it wasn't A-list actors. Yes, it was a prodigal son story....SO WHAT??!! At least it was a story, about real (flawed) people struggling through life making choices (not alwasy good ones)and trying to walk their faith. No one is a villan and no one is a hero....it was as much a slice of contemporary life as you will ever get in a movie. And yes, it was a good film deviod of vapid garbage and filthy language....the whole family can watch it and learn something from it about being human and doing what is right instead of what is easy or glamorous. So set aside your big budget expectations and ENJOY!"
5,superb movie,I loved this movie.it showed that no matter how far away we get from God that He is always there calling us to come back home.Superb!
5,Excellent reading.,I read this book and find it is an exccellent guide to the care of our emerging elderly. I understand that it is also very popular with the Youth In Asia and russia.
3,a little overpriced,"I use for recording music and they have a nice sound quality. They take a long time to record as they are not high speed. I wish I'd bought something that would copy faster, especially for the price I paid for them. I would say if your device can use high speeds, don't get these and if you don't necessarily want to re-record get CD-R."
4,Flight/History,"Bought this for a gift and they liked it...that's about all I can say about it...if someone is interested in flying, this seemed like a great gift.."
4,Predictions made easy!,I purchased this book in 2007 and I have caught the cash 3 daily drawing thirty times. Before buying this item I had only won twice in seven years. This is a great book and will turn a poor player into a winner!this item is a great tool to be used in lottery pools to select daily numbers. If you are willing to be patient and follow the simple instructions you will be amazed at the results. I won the first week I used this system!! Thanks
1,What a waste!,"What a waste of time, energy and money. I bought this inkjet hungry money pit thinking it would be a great investment. The first few prints were great, but performance and reliability steadily declined and the only consistency has been it's ability to disappoint me every time I attempt to use it. I have spent countless hours dealing with printer errors, trying to get the paper to load, trying to get rid of streaks, lines, cleaning etc... Now it is out of ink and I refuse to put another dime into it. What a piece of junk! This is the third and last Epson printer I will ever own."
1,Not as satisfied as the others,"I was so disappointed after purchasing this printer. Many had raved about it. I had trouble with it from day 1 and found epson to not be very helpful. I should have returned it within the 30 days. But, it seemed if I kept at it, it would get better. I have lots of trouble printing from InDesign. I get nothing bit media errors, even though I can print from other programs. I have to make a PDF file every-time and then print from acrobat. The inks seems to use up too quickly too and the other day I couldn't even turn it off. I had to unplug it as the on/off button wouldn't work. Needless to say, I have not been happy with this printer. That is not to say it is a bad printer, as so many others have had no trouble and love it..I think I got a lemon and I was hoping a company like epson would have done better by me. I guess that is the last time I buy an epson printer. Which is a shame, cause I have purchased so many epson products in the past."
2,Very Frustrating,"When print heads aren't clogged, it produces the most beautiful prints I could ever hope for. The problem is, there are too few times when all of the print heads aren't clogged, and the cleaning cycle slurps up ink like a thirsty dog at a water bowl.A complete set of cartridges now costs me about $150-$160 so I don't appreciate it when I have to use about half of my ink on multiple cleaning cycles to get a few good prints per session. Is there some secret to cleaning that I don't know about?I feel the least Epson could have done was make it so one could clean only the print heads that are clogged, not all 8 whether they need it or not. The bottom line is, I love my printer but can't afford to use it. I would recommend it, though, to anyone who can."
5,Epson R1800 - What I needed!,"I have previously owned an Epson, and returned again since this was the only product in its category that had all the features I needed. It is incredibly quiet, and prints very quickly, no matter if it is a Speed or Quality print you are sending to it. It prints up to 13"" x 19"" sheets or even on rolls of banner paper and printable CD's."
3,Tricky,"The printer setup was easy, but I am still working on the color calibration. Initial prints have not been close to the appearance on the monitor. One of the included software items was a demostration of a calibration setup. That would probably solve the calibration problems, but it costs around $380."
3,epson R1800,"I have been an Epson printer user for years, but I'm having trouble with matte printing on my new R1800. They seem to have a hazy look if you're not looking at them straight on. I'm waiting on Epson customer service for a reply."
4,"Outstanding ""roadhouse rock""! great party CD.",I saw these guys as an opening act for Ringo Starr and his All Star band.Great energy and jammin' style which comes thru loud and clear on this recording!
4,Belly acheing punsters fantasy,"Although this is not my Favorite of Robinsons books, It still is a joyes read. If You truly enjoy light hearted fantasy fiction with a whole slew of puns mixed liberally in, this is it for you. I await more."
5,The dream of scipio,This book arrive in beautiful condition. I have not started reading it yet. A friend read it & highly recommended it. great story
5,Come to this book with your mind wide open,"For most readers expecting another Fingerpost, I'm sure this book is a great surprise, be it positive or negative. The truth is that this book is unlike anything else Pears has written, at least in published form. I originally discovered this book via its Russian translation. All across Russia, this book has received the highest reviews, not only for its beautiful prose, but also for its three dramatic and powerful stories entwined as one. Not many of today's writers can write in such a deep and rich way. That said, Pears' other stories seem as if they've been written by another writer altogether. In this reviewer's opinion, The Dream of Scipio stands high above all the rest. It is Pears' shining masterpiece."
1,Avoid at all costs,"After Fingerpost I looked forward to The Dream of Scipio. What a disappointment. This latest oeuvre is tedium heaped upon tedium, padding piled upon padding; a book only too easy to put down."
2,impossible toy,"This toy left much to be desired. I am 28 and found pieces of this toy to hard to take apart and put back together. The batman figure with changeable outfits is just impossible (had to use plyers to change the head). I have super glued portions of this toy so it can be handeled. This toy says 4 and up, personally I think it should be more like 10 and up with high levels of patience."
3,The Sims Falls short...,"As an avid player of the Sims games, I recieved this around Christmas last year. I still continue to play it, but there are some things about me that bother it. First, somebody decided to make it more kid-friendly and decided to put underwear on the characters when they're showering of bathing, but it's still blurred. WHY do that? It was fine before when it was blurred when they weren't wearing anything. Secondly, they took out a whole lot of items from the original on the XBox. The game is also slow on the Playstation 2 and can freeze if you're doing too much at once.The game is enjoyable, and the graphics have become a bit better, but the underwear while bathing, the lack of more items and the lack of gestures to do like 'woo hoo' and makeout are annoying. The Pets don't really do anything interesting, which I believe was just a stunt to make more money.It's an ok game, but it's not the best game in the world."
3,OK-DOKAY,This is a fun game for ages 8+. Interesting concept and fun toSimulate all sorts of people. I created my whole family!! It gets pretty boring after a while and the fun stops being fun.:( but still fun for a while. BUY IT FOR A MORE REASONABLE PRICE. Like 5$ or 10$. NOW I CANT BELIVE I SPENT MY 20 BUCKS ON THIS WHEN I COULD HAVE GOT IT AT THE STORE FOR 5 BUCKS! SHEEEESH!
2,Wish I never installed this on my Pc,"I am not much of a pet fan. I dont like my sims hope of obtaining a pet in their aspirations list. Unfortunately if I unistall it, I will start all over again."
1,"A Poorly Written, Unrealistic Novel","This novel is not only a bad read, but it portrays African-Americans in a bad light. You can do much better if you are trying to find good African-American literature. I agree with the other reviewer, we are only TOLD that Richard Wright is a good writer."
4,Refrigeration is key,"If you are like me (and few people are so keep *that* in mind), you do not care for the taste of many energy drinks. For me, I suspect it is the taurine. It's a bitter taste that most drink makers try to hide with intense citrus. It never works. Mandarin Mint is no exception... however... once refrigerated, the taste was fairly decent. The ""mint"" flavor is drowned out by the taurine, but on the other hand they almost cancel each other out - which is pretty much a *good* thing. And the ""mandarin"" flavor is supposed to be a little more bitter than typical ""orange"" flavoring, so it does a good job of masking the remaining taste. As for the ""energizing"" effect, I give this drink a jittery thumbs up.My short answer: Don't drink them when warm, but otherwise chug-a-lug!"
5,Pleased,Extremely happy with how quickly I received my item. This bible is very helpful for my biblical studies. I would recommend it to others and to purchase from Amazon.
5,"Homer, Pope & Flaxman","The Heritage Press edition of the Odyssey features the historically significant Alexander Pope translation and illustrations by John Flaxman.Elegant and restained, this edition has a matte gold-colored slipcase, a navy exterior blindstamped with rules in a Greek key pattern, and gold details to the spine.Flaxman, almost a contemporary of Pope, was born in 1775. A great draftsman, sculptor, and an important neo-Classical figure, he might be best known today for his designs that appeared on Wedgwood pottery. Flaxman's work is derived from, but is not slave to, the ancient figures that appear in vase-painting and bas-reliefs. He demonstrates great economy, a strong use of line, an a formidable command of the language of anatomy.With an introduction by John Winterich, Carl Van Doren's note on Pope's translation that credits Pope's collaborators in the translation process. 357 pp with over 20 full page illustrations."
3,"Confused, but Intrigued","So far I have read the first two books of the trilogy and I'm not really sure what's going on. What I do know is that when I picked up the book I couldn't put it down and I finished both within hours of receiving them. I slightly prefer this one to the first primarily because I like this character, Merilynn, more so than Eve. I feel that I should mention that this book, ""Merilynn"", is more sexual than the first. I'm incredibly excited to see what happens in ""Samantha"", I'm sure that it will all come together and make more sense. At that point I can start from scratch and read the three, one right after another.It has also awakened an interest in folklore for me. I particularly enjoy books that make you want to learn more about a subject."
1,If I could this book would get a half of a star,I have read many lesbian novels but this one is the worst of any I have read. The dialogue is sappy and moronic. I donate many of the books I read to a lesbian groups library. This book is so awful I would be ashamed to give it to them.
1,Awful,"Tiny, rinky-dink tool set. Looked like it was made by Tonka or possible Hasbro. Returned immediately. Don't waste your time."
3,Not as good as her first one,I waited for this book to come out and was disappointed in it. I really enjoyed her first one but found this one a little hard to follow and swallow.
5,Teen reader!!!,Well this is a really good book im 12 years old and i read it twice. it has some older humor but yonger ages also can read it. I really enjoyed it . Im trying to find other books by this author. once you read this u will want 2 2 . bye 4 now. Oh this book is frickin awesome!!!
1,Old software,Windows 7 doesn't work with this software. Same with a lot of software for my 5 yr. old that I buy from Amazon.Talk about selling old software. But I need to check before buying. I just assumed that software would work in Windows 7.
3,Railroad Radio,"I bought this to listen to train crews. It has been helpful but I wish it had a guide to how and when rail workers use the radio. I know this would change from railroad company to company, but it would be helpful. It is a good frequency guide."
4,I was in search,yes i was realy in search of quick review book of Urology and i found it faboulous and fantastic book. ican review the concerened topic while pat is in X-Ray room. i would recommend all in urology to buy this book.
4,I'd prefer more natural ingredients,"Be aware, the list of ingredients contains nether pomegranate or blackberry. I am also not sure putting amino acids in a drink is such a grand idea. We get all amino acids we need from proteins, anyway.In my opinion, this soda does not taste very natural. However, it does appear to be a healthier alternative to regular sugar-loaded carbonated drinks."
3,ehhh,"Rampage is fun, a little hard to get the hang of at first. Perhaps I am too old for it, but I lost interest pretty quickly."
2,Not as good as the NES Version,"Ok im going to make this short and sweet, this game has good graphics, no issuse there. But where the issues come in, it's about the crappy camera angel, which could never happen for the NES Version, and the gameplay is poopPlease vote this as a helpfull review!"
1,Not great,I recomend buying this game for any of the other systems you may own. The Wii controls are a disaster and you'll find yourself flailing your arms and not getting anything accomplished.I call this a pass.
1,its ok,"my problem is that you have to use this 2x a day for 2 weeks. I did it for a week and didnt notice a whole lot. I got discourage and stopped using it. I guess I would preffer a strip i just stick on and peel off, or a treatment i only have to do once a day for say..a week or less. This required 28 applications in 2 weeks."
3,It works; Clips are nearly useless,"Save yourself some time and throw the included dash clips away and then reuse the clips from the panel you're replacing. Other then the clips, the paint is color matched well and the fit is pretty good."
3,A new perspective on the actress,"Patty is not the best author but her book is moving. I had no idea of the bad childhood she had at the hands of parents unable to care for her because of ther own problems. She was raised by ambitious and selfish, in my opinion agents who changed her name and took away all her self worth. She struggled throughout her life to the point at which the book was published and is candid in discussing her mental illness which took many years to diagnose and treat. It is no longer totally up to date in her discussion of the mental illness she suffered, but is encouraging for those dealing with the same problems."
3,"Interesting, fairly well-written memoir","In this memoir, Patty (nee Anna Marie) Duke recounts her life from young childhood to the age of her early forties. It is difficult to discern what did or did not really happen in most of the anecdotes Ms. Duke presents for our perusal, due to the emotional overlay and foul language she attaches to her accounts. (One supposes she is not always so sure what happened herself!). The book is generally interesting, and one believes Ms. Duke honestly wishes to help others by telling her story. One wishes for an end to the histrionics, however, after a while. This is, after all, the story of an entertainer's life, not that of someone who perhaps has made more of a contribution to society."
5,This book was a lifesaver!,"I read this book over 20 years ago, and it literally helped me to ""diagnose"" my then-husband with bipolar manic-depression. Reading about Ms. Duke helped me to see that my ex-husband needed to seek help from a psychiatrist, and also helped me to feel less alone in the midst of what we were going through. I highly recommend this book!"
1,Not Impressed,"We just purchased this clock for our 4 year old and are very disappointed in it. The games and other teaching features are just okay, but the part I really hate, is that it can't be turned off. The chime that goes off, every half hour or hour is set by a blue button on the upper right corner, that the kids press all day long. It has four sounds, a chime, a cow mooing, a rooster crowing and silent. The problem is that the kids play with it and it gets left of the annoying cow or rooster sound and then goes all night. I thought I had the answer to this by making sure it wasn't in my sons room at night, but then I could hear it from the family room all the way in my room! I was so tired and mad that I put it outside in the backyard until I could take the batteries out the next day. I am shocked that this toy has such good reviews and just wanted other parents to be aware of this annoying feature. If I had know about this, I would not have bought it."
5,Excellent,"Our Daughter received this as a gift for her third Birthday and loves it.It is a great learning too and also fun, she is always asking us the time and now she presses the button on her new clock and it tells her the time.We love this product and would recommend it!"
3,Bad Decisions,"I read this book, and did enjoy it. However, I do have some complaints. I identified with the main character in the fact that she wanted to move to somewhere with nice people, clean air, and where everything is less expensive. However, all of her choices after that were choices I can't understand. She does learn from her mistakes, but they are big mistakes that could be avoided. I think the book mainly shows that no matter who you are or think you are, you're just a product of you environment. It's a great quick, enjoyable, and sometimes funny read, but if you're looking for a heroine, Lucinda isn't it."
3,Good start but..,"It almost seems to me that maybe a few chapters were left out of this book. Characters were introduced but not followed through on. For example, of Mason's 3 children only Erin is focused on. Didn't the other 2 boys visit? The same with the local tv station, didn't she ever go in to work?I agree with the reviewer that some paragraphs were way too wordy. They were a distraction.And finally, for someone who considered herself a smart person, how did Lucinda end up in such a miserable situation! I mean, she became absolutely clueless!It was funny in the parts involving Lucinda's New York boss tho. Maybe she should have stayed in New York????"
1,A Total Letdown,"I loved the essays in Ms. Daum's first book, My Misspent Youth, so I was expecting something infinitely smarter and funnier that the flimsy chick-lit fluff-fest that is Quality of Life Report. Totally surprising in it's awfulness."
3,could have been better,"Although there were moments of complete frustration with Lucinda's character the book did have some great redeeming qualities. For one: There are laugh out-loud moments. Not sure if this because I could relate to Lucinda--being a city girl who once moved to a small MidWestern town for 2 years. Overall, the book was a best a light summer read. The pace could have used improvement."
5,Title a bit misleading . . .,"I was at first a little hesitant to read this book when I first heard the title. After I learned more about it, however, I was intrigued and willing to give it a try. This is not usually the type of book that I would choose for myself. When I began reading, I found myself hooked! The author is wonderfully sarcastic and this book is a truly humorous and enjoyable read. It is very easy to relate to the main character, Lucinda Trout, and I feel that many can relate to her ambitions as well. The odd title of the book soon makes perfect sense as one begins the journey with Lucinda to a part of the country where one can experiece a ""better quality of life."""
2,Daum can do better,"Meghan Daum has proven in her essays she knows how to be funny, insightful, lyrical, interesting. ""The Quality of Life Report,"" however, fails to be any of those things. Once the character Lucinda Trout leaves New York, the book becomes less interesting and a cliche of midwestern life, with only minorly interesting observations. One expects to find corncob pipes in the pockets of the one-dimensional characters Daum's written.The book is mean spirited rather than funny and is not believable (why is she living with that guy??). The potential was there for the book to be an interesting self exploration by the main character but instead dissolves into a predictable Lifetime movie of the week. And why, for the love of God, does Daum spend so much time mentioning that bowl from Pier 1???"
2,Disappointing,"The lively writing in the first few pages caused me to buy this book. Two-thirds of the way through I closed it and tossed it onto the pile of library donations. The people in this story are surely stereotypes, but they made me (who spent her first 40 years in New York City and worked in several publishing houses) really uncomfortable. Enough dysfunction already. Ick!"
1,A Mistake!,"This was my first bluetooth headset and what a mistake!It does not fit close to my ear and I am constantly pushing it into my ear, it feels like it will fall off at any time.the biggest problem however is that it turns on with the slightest pressure. I have recalled many people not knowing I have done so!It is very frustrating when you are trying to make a call with the phone, you think that the connection didn't go through until you realize that the dumb headset has turned on in your purse. I bought Motorola because I expected it to be better than a less known brand IT IS VERY DISAPPOINTING!"
3,SO SO,"The Motorola H500 Bluetooth Headset looks pretty cool, however, it doesn't perform very well when phone reception isn't at a maximum. Most of the time I can hear the people I talk to just fine, but my friends tell me that I sound fuzzy when I talk. Despite its shortcommings, this headset is especially handy when you want to talk to someone while you're driving a standard transmission vehicle."
3,Does the job,First alittle backround. I live in Albuquerque New Mexico and they just inforced a no driving with out a hands free device.I would not have purchased a Bluetooth headset other wise.I hardly use it other than when im driving.The headset works and does its thing but the volume even on its highest setting is still to low to have the radio on or the windows down.As a whole the headset works and does what its supposed to.
3,"Iffy, but good price.","I use this with my computer phone. The quality is in and out for the sound. Sometimes it's great sometimes it isn't. My friends also complain of a reverb if I have the headset volume up too high. The upside is that it does work for a good distance so I can leave the computer and not worry about loosing the signal. Probably would end up spending more next time, to get a higher quality headset. But for my uses right now it works just fine."
2,Eh...,"It works fine, but sometimes it just stops linking my calls, and I have to re sync it with my phone. honestly, sometimes i feel that i was safer in the car talking on my phone by my ear...either way...it's still really cool when it works."
1,Buzzing Noise,"I tried the unit. To my surprise, I thought it was cool, but the person on the other end did not. There is this terrible buzzing noise going on. Maybe the one I have is defective. Other than that I would recommend the product."
4,works great,this blue tooth head set orks great with my motorola phone... only problem is its backside hook is not feixible. if it does not fit your eye lobe size you can use this. fortunately it fits mine almost so I can use it.if you are buying a blue tooth make sure you try it on before you buy it..
3,liked it,"i liked it, so far i did n't face any problems. when the charge is less the voice clarity seems to be less"
2,Not Recommended,"The one I got was ok but I'd rather a different one. I could hear others, and others could hear me fairly well. Sometimes I needed to speak louder than usual. The worst problem with it was it didn't stay on my ear securely. The unit sits on the outside of the ear with the loop that goes above the ear but If I turned my head quickly it would swing out slightly and then bounce back on to my head, and the person you were talking to could here a bump. I don't like worrying if this one will fall off my face."
1,Microphone didn't work,"It acted as thought it was muted when it wasn't. I tried it on two separate cell phones and it did the same thing on both phones. The person being called could hear the first syllable and that was it. I did try to turn the mute off, all it did was change the frequency of the buzzing sound the other person heard."
1,Wrong Photo,"The Picture on the item is that of a H700, I have called amazon a couple of times about this and they have no clue about this, they have even said (a week back) that they will be changing this in their catalog, but no changes yet.someone from Amazon's team please care to update me. I had to purchase another more expensive headset, coz I wasnt sure what I would get. Well they did say that i wasn't going to get the headset featured in the picture for sure..."
2,Toothless,"While this device connected well with the razor cell phone, it does not hold to your ear. This inconvenience makes it somewhat useless."
3,The volume isn't loud enough,"I like having the hands free operation, but others on the other end of the call cannot hear unless I raise my voice and sometimes is broken up. The volume on my end isn't loud enough unless you push it closer to the ear. I don't recommend this product, but I'll deal with it because it was a decent price."
2,Disappointing,"I was really excited to get a Bluetooth headset for use with my new LG8300.Unfortunately, while I can hear everyone just fine, my callers say they hear terrible distortion, deep echoing and generally very poor call quality. People have asked me to not call them on this headset.It's really too bad, with all of the hype and extra selling of Bluetooth accessories.So, this was a wasted purchase as far as I am concerned.I'm not sure what the other two reviewers were saying, but my H500 is exactly like the picture.Grade: A for styleGrade: D for utility"
1,never worked,"with this headset all you could hear was static. never even the sound of a voice. was disapointed in the product from the beginning, the packaging was just the headset, charger and instructions wrapped in plastic wrap... just received the headset back from my son in law and am returning it."
3,OK for the money and works better than the H-700,"I bought this for my wife for the convenience of having her hands free while driving, or in the kitchen, or working in the yard. My first bluetooth was this model, but when I used it people complained that the mike picked up too much ambient noise and had a noticeable echo. Other than that one complaint, everything else worked fine. The range was as advertised as well as the talk and standby time. The battery charged quickly and lasted for several days, depending on how much I talked (of course), and it paired easily with the MOTORAZR V3m. I upgraded to the H-700 because of its noise suppression chip, but was very disappointed with it. The range was horrible, and had to deal with a lot of static. The noise suppression chip is worthless. I retired the 700 and I'm using something else now. The H-500 headset is not the best one out there, but for the money it is better than the H-700 hands down."
3,H500 Bluetooth,Didn't particularly like this product. Have had the H850 and the H700 bluetooth headset in the past and both operated much better. Battery life was short in this model.
3,Not a perfect fit,"I was a little disappointed with the fit of this product. When I installed it, the top right corner was not flush with the dash and the clips that were supplied were not strong enough to hold the unit in place very firmly. I ended up taking the metal clips off of my factory unit and putting them on the kit unit, after which the kit held much better but still did not sit flush on the right side. So I am not completely happy with this product and if it weren't such a hassle to remove and replace, I would probably try the other brand."
3,Sorry Folks,Just saw this movie for first time (here it is August 2010) and I have to say I found it disappointing especially in light of its reputation. Acting was ok but with such charismatic actors as Hunter and Hurt I think you should get more. Perhaps it was the script which may have over-reached and struck me as superficial.I enjoyed the film but did not see it as an award recognition vehicle in any category.Sorry.
3,Perhaps Locke wanted to be TOO comprehensive,"I just loved reading this book because I knew very few things about how to behave with international suppliers.The foremost target of this book is giving you good advices in order to deal with suppliers but the problem is that it's focused on the US point of view so it's rather difficult to explicitate this into you own point of view.These advices range from cultural differences to law and currency, aside from logistics;that's why when you've read the last page you feel a little confused about the real topic of it.The book has really good appendix even if a little outdated.Buying Dick Locke's book would be worthwhile only at 2 conditions:-You are American-You are absolutely new to Supply Management"
2,"good introduction, but not much of expert knowledge","The ""gimics"" part of this DVD is the more interesting part, which actually tells you how real card shark cheat with gimics such as various types of card clips. But the sleights bit is a bit too common if you have background knowledge on manipulations such as the pass and differenet types of partial or full control false shuffle, false deal etc. Overall this worth 4 stars as a basic introduction, but 2 stars for those who have prior knowledge on card magic and manipulations."
4,A good beginning,"I really like The End and this CD. They could be a really good club band (which I think they must be, but I've never seen them in person). The music is so feisty with a good rhythm, but also heart-felt and kind of sensitive. They sing about pretty poignant themes; sometimes it doesn't match with the music, but it is a really interesting juxtaposition. For a debut album, this is worth collecting."
3,.,"the end has possibility. will they render? will they just become another Mr. Mister: full potential, then fall 2 zero.Damon, the consumate renderer, wants 2 know- hopes it goes full blast.Gimme a tight click 2 the kick drum; 'oh, the humanity'."
5,"Run, don't walk.","I don't know why I haven't heard of these guys prior to hearing their CD at a party recently. What a shame. Hey, spread the word and let everyone know that these guys are the real thing. As I said, run, don't walk to anywhere that carries their CD. The singer sounds like what would happen if Chris Cornell and Stevie Wonder had a child. The drummer is tight and rocking. The harmonies are amazing. The guitars are like Queen meets Van Halen, but in a modern way. The bassist has an amazing feel and plays like Jaco Pastorius would have played it. I'm not a musician, but I know great music when I hear it. Run, don't walk."
4,4.5 Stars are Lyrics alone...,"Ras Kass is one of the dopes MC's in the game period. Not just on the west coast..Soul On Ice didn't get the promotion that it deserved. The track ""Nature of the threat"" is the most informative hip hop song of all time..and just think...the average rap fan hasn't even heard this album..."
2,Borrow it from the library...,"This book has beautiful photos, and could perhaps inspire creativity. That's about it! There are very general descriptions with the photos, but absolutely no direction or patterns, or even methods used to construct anything pictured in this book. While there are some neat ideas, some pieces go beyond ""vintage whimsy"" and border on school craft project (like glueing a flower to an Easter Egg). Fortunately, this book isn't too expensive.... But save your money and just flip through it at the library or bookstore. There aren't very many words, and without helpful patterns/project steps, you likely won't be referring back to this book in the future."
2,False description,"From the title of the item you may understand that there are 2 brushes. However is only one for 12 gauge. In general from this seller (outdoor bunker) the items arrive late.Other than that it is the normal brush that you will expect. Nothing special, kind of short."
5,An Offbeat Genius,"I've listened to Cindy Lee since college & its never been easy to find her CDs. Too bad, since her first album ""Who's Gonna Save the World,"" is an absolute classic, featuring songs like ""She Had Everything,"" ""Whatever Works,"" ""Kelly Green,"" and ""Steve on H."" She's also super nice-I met her once after a great show she did in NYC a long, long time ago. I've found her latter stuff to be less immediately accessible, but ultimately rewarding."
5,Perfect size Kid's Coat Rack!,This was the perfect size and color for my 3 year old daughter's room. Although she needs a step stool to reach the top... she still LOVES it... as do I!
5,I WISH THOSE DAYS COULD COME BACK,"HEARING ""A SUMMER SONG"" REMINDS ME OF MEMPHIS, TENNESSEE - WHEN THE SUN SHINED AND THE SONG PLAYED WHILE I ENJOYED MY SUMMER. I LOVE ""A SUMMER SONG"" I WISH THOSE DAYS OF SUMMER COULD COME BACK!SMT"
1,nope,Very weak display - need to turn it just right to see numbers. Followed directions to the T and it apparently can't hold a calibration. It will be returned.Also an adventure just to get my hands on it. TWO WEEKS shipping!! I could have drove it to my house faster.
4,Enjoyed watching it every time,"This film blows me away for a couple of reasons. 1: It was shot entirely in one day. Actually in just 17 hours. 2: The acting and plot are both great 3: It's an independent film that successfully pulled of this one of a kind fun thoughtful easy-to-follow yet unpredictable time-travel movie. Maybe it's just me, but I haven't seen many movies that claim all three. The script is as well developed as the characters, both are a little bit quirky yet still believable. It's a real treat and it's one of those that is just as great (if not better) the second time around as well. Great for the fan of indi and mainstream films alike. Relatively recent movie, so music and backgrounds and even corporate culture is easy to identify with, as well as some deeper level of human needs that are, well, timeless."
5,My Review,"Its a great book to read.My favorite part is when theres 3 eight graders and they see someone at the trashcan looking in it.One of the boys said ;Hey don,t jump pops,you got everything to live for.Then other boy saids:Yeah plus I heard the food is much better at the dumpster on the street.But the thrid kid realize its his grandfather.Thats my hook."
1,Terrible,"I love a good western; unfortunately this one was hard to watch. It seemed like I was sitting through a high school play. I tried three times, hoping it would get better or perhaps interesting. It didn't. The only thing cool was the shots of Old Tucson.Bad story. Bad acting. Bad movie. The reason I wrote this is to let anyone interestedNot to waist their time, there are so many more westerns that you could watch."
1,"This is the Edited, Softcore ""retail-friendly"" version!!!","Warning to anyone considering this title: This and the Original ""Guys Gone Wild"" DVDs are edited to be less explicit so they are acceptable for sale at most retail stores. These are NOT the uncensored, really wild titles that are also part of the Guys Gone Wild line, like ""Dude Where's My Pants?"", ""The Big Easy"" and ""Heatstroke"". Be sure you know you are getting a more playful, less sexual video if you get this instead of those other GGW titles."
1,"This is the edited version of ""Guys Gone Wild: Heatstroke""","FYI- this is the ""retail-friendly"" edited version of Guys Gone Wild: Heatstroke to show less raunchy material, making it acceptable at mainstream retailers. Be sure to get ""Heatstroke"" instead if you want the full uncensored version of this title."
3,Decent,"The DVD only goes for 50 or so minutes, but its high quality, and for 15 bucks its not badIf you like amatuer guys then youl like this"
2,Pictures only with no content issues.,"The title of this book is really appealing, but I found this book to be a superficial coffee table book. There is no thought provoking commentary or essay which could place the ""cup"" within a social context or place the cup with a material culture.The color prints are on matt paper which makes the images seem a little dull and fuzzy. Not one cups seems to jump off the page and into my memory.Adding to my disappointment is that every cup appears to be the same size and shape. The decoration or embellishment on the cups is only on the surface. It seems that the artists, writer, musicians, architects, etc., that are featured in the book, were only asked to offer a graphic design to a standard demitasse cup. Why couldn't they change the shape or form of the cup?How disappointing! The idea behind the book is great, the execution is boring and limited.I would not recommend buying this book.Harriete Estel Berman"
2,Cans were bent,50% of the cans were bent very badly. I would not buy bent cans in the store and I was very dissatisfied with getting so many very badly dented cans.
1,They are not great,"These are my least favorite of the Loma Linda products. Unfortunately, the texture is a bit like modeling clay and the taste is unappealing to me."
4,I was skeptical...,"But these were great! The first bite, I wasn't sure, the second bite I decided I liked them, third bite decided they were really pretty good. They actually reminded me of something, I can't quite recall what though. I have tried several of the alternative dog options Yves ect..., but have never liked any of them, they all have that...taste...blech. I really enjoyed these.Loma Linda Big Franks, 20-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)"
1,Not all are music videos!,"I was very upset to find out that not all were music videos. Some of them are live performances. For example, Un Alma en Pena, the reason I bought this CD/DVD set is a live performance on ""Siempre en Domingo"" and not the music video! That videos is THE BEST video she ever made, and it is missing."
4,Great illustrations,"Great how-to-book, but too many hard projects (Building a wall, Installing a Window) and not enough basic capentry (like frames and wooden step-stools or boxes."
3,Legends of the Lake,This is a pretty cool electronic fishing game. We did notice that it is very difficult to get a fish to actually stay on and catch it. This was even with an adult trying it out.
4,2012 Civic EX-L,"Just like previous reviews said, you need to countersink the factory bolt so 6.5 inch speakers lay flat. The other problem when used on the rear deck of a 2012 Civic is that the bolt hole in the adapter does not line up with the hole on the frame so I had to sort of push the frame to the point where I think the tabs had a chance of breaking to get the bolt back in. There was minimal warping to the adapter. It has been a week since I installed them and I have not had issues. I do think there may be a need for a redesign for the 2012 Honda models. Other than that, they made it easy to just drop in aftermarket speakers."
3,Oh Brother? Not exactly.,"The cartridge was not what was advertised. Brother LC41BK was advertised and pictured and I got an Xprint brand wrapped in Christmas paper. It was obviously an opened Christmas return. Couldn't find the ""tab"" the instructions said to remove (knew it wouldn't work unless the tab was removed) and after about a frustrating hour of searching and online research I assumed the previous owners probably removed the tab. After installation the cartridge worked fine. Whew, guess you get what you pay for."
3,"Great information on blades, but a bit outdated","As a beginning knife enthusiast...I found that the book provided valuable basic information in choosing a knife, but the book is a bit outdated. Due to new knife manufacturing technology, there are more knives to choose from, improvements in quality, better handles and blade materials, and upcoming bladesmiths entering the field. Overall, a good book, but maybe Mr. Walker can come out with a millenium edition on Battle Blades."
5,Best Swiss Army Knife I Ever Owned!!!,"Got this because I love gadgets and this sure has enough for the most demanding gadget freak!! It even has a tiny little screwdriver wedged in the corkscrew that you can use to tighten your glasses or even take the back off your watch. It has everything I use...pliers, scissors, and the most handy magnifying glass. This is a great product to use as needed and a must have as a survival knife in case of a disaster. Pair this with the mini LED light Victorinox offers and you are PREPARED !!!! Buy it. Remember to get a nice sheath to protect your knife!!!!"
4,Great gift and value,Bought for my 18 year old son who has bugged me for one for years. He loved it. It has everything you need and still small enough to carry around
1,Very disappointed,I was very disappointed when I received my purchase. The knife had a huge chip out of the handle. This was suppose to be a gift....there is no way I can use this for a gift!
3,Maybe too many tools,I bought this as a gift for my dad. Far better as a desk drawer tool and too large to keep in a pocket.
2,I'm disappointed for this item,"I'm exciting to receive it,but when i check it with detail, i'm disappointed.One of the tools is broken,after i take it up, i can't take it back!!!"
3,Personal Buy Only,"Everything was sharp and clean, except the sides were scratched up. Someone probably got a bunch of defective ones, explains why price was so good. Not a good gift as it would look used, but other than the few scratches everything was in new condition."
3,Wonderful work but stops dead right in the middle of a budding romance,"This is a fine work of historical research and theological analysis that also happens to be a great love story too. It's the love story that keeps the reader slogging through the mud of the former two ---quite an accomplishment. But when the actual historical fragments on which the book were based were exhausted, the book ended too, bang. What the Hell happened to the lovers?"
1,Grasping at Straws,"This book was given to me by a ""bapticostal"" pastor when he found out I was attending a word of faith church. I read it and thankfully it prompted me to read books by E.W Kenyon and Kenneth Hagin. The author will have you believe that the word of faith teachers are heretics and cult members. The author even quotes books written by Ralph Waldow Trine (who isn't a word of faith teacher) but because he went to the same school as Kenyon then he surely must have the same views. What is that....guilt by association?? That is just ridiculous. If you read this book then I would suggest you read books by Kenyon and Hagin and make up your own mind. This author is grasping at straws to make an argument against something he is afraid of...and God is not the author of fear...Satan is."
5,SAVED ALL MY FURNITURE...,"I cringe every time I spend $10.95 for one of these at Walmart. It is cardboard inside of cardboard with a bag of catnip. It has about 50 cents worth of product in it. But my cats love it. The first ones I had to use the catnip and show them how to use it. After a while they started to love these things (I keep 2 in the house with 4 cats ...who have their claws.) The one cat would sleep on it. After a while, the cats tear them up and make quite a mess. I am now at the point, the cats know what they are and I don't need to add the catnip. Today I bought one, tossed it on the floor and 2 cats couldn't wait to use it. We just take that catnip and smoke it later once we get the seeds out.The cats still claw the furniture. Hey! They're cats. But I like to believe there is some corner of the house I am saving with this scratcher."
2,EHH!,"Not so good,Easy had a lot better songs and mixes than what was on this disc.I listened to it once,not even fully,then I traded it in at the local music shop,towards some Beasties,I probably got maybe $1.80 back on a $7.20 original purchase price,do not buy."
2,Lame and Inane,"Perhaps this cozy mystery has more to offer to the long-time readers already acquainted with the numerous characters. Family dynamics might have been amusing to someone more familiar, but were simply an irritation to this reader. Replacement hips, broken shoulders, deafness, dementia and free loading 30-year old kids simply are not amusing. Too many characters, living and dead, that just kept popping up throughout the book made it almost impossible to keep up with the story, the chatter was over the top, but not delightfully so, and the mystery was so very convoluted I really didn't CARE who had done it - I was just ready for the book to end. Where Ms. Danheim REALLY lost me though, was when a character was calling the airlines to check on passenger manifests. There should be SOME reality in a cozy mystery, some clever twists, and a lot more of setting and research by my thinking. This was a senseless hodgepodge."
3,where is my cousin,what happened to the banter between the two cousins??? for years judith and renie have been solving mysteries together but since their husband's retired all of a sudden all four are involved in crime solving. Bring back the cousins and help us laugh again..
4,An extraordinary family drama,"I picked up this masterpiece, and I couldn't put it down for 2 hours . . . I had to go onstage to perform, and I found myself wandering back to it every time I left stage. Almost missed an entrance! LOL For anyone who loves intricate relationships in theatre, this one is for you! 5 player drama, with some amazing dialogue . . . keeps you believing in the magic of theatre!"
1,Out of date garbage,"I can see his point. We've all been a customer and we all want respect. But to treat employees, cashiers, waiters etc, as if they're worthless is counterproductive. The customer is always right? I don't know who came up with that phrase, but it's wrong. Anybody in the customer service industry knows that. Nobody's ALWAYS right, if that were true our mothers would never let us forget it! To base his whole philosophy of abuse and harrassment of employees and staff on a free slice of pickle is ludicrious.This book does nothing but give teeth and claws to the abusive employer and gives nasty abusive customers bad ideas. There are better ways to get a smile with your meal, or polite, productive employees. It's called 'Thank you' or 'You're doing a great job!' and HECK maybe following basic tipping ettiquette."
3,No Bonus Anymore,"Ok, I bought this after reading the reviews. I was going to get the Pilates Core Power: abdominals and back, but after reading the reviews that that was included in Total Body Training Pilates, I ordered that one instead. I find only one workout on this video and most of it uses the resist-a-ring. While this seems to be a fine workout, it NO LONGER has the bonus workout, so don't get it for that."
2,Awkward Yemonja,"This book is very informative and interesting, but the grammatical and typographical errors are horrible. The endnotes are in strange places and some are missing. Whole pages are duplicated. This book needs serious editing."
4,Found it!,Had this on L.P. years ago and was very hard to track down on CD and coulnt find it at all on MP3
1,Horrible quality,"Don't do it! I read reviews and picked this one, what a mistake. The quality of the picture is terrible. You can see mini squares in your pictures. Not clear! Also there is no shuffle, the way you put the pictures in is the way they show. The back piece to make it stand up is poor quality too."
1,frame freezes randomly,"This picture frame does not work. It freezes randomly. I sent mine back twice and received the same ""pos"". Do not buy. You will be sorry."
2,Nothing Special,"There are much better frames out there. This frame is a very plain black plastic that looks cheap. The picture quality is so-so. It doesn't work with vista. I returned the opteka and bought the HP frame instead......much better. Better features, picture quality, frame (black wood) and works with vista."
3,Misrepresented computer compatability,"I was disappointed with this program because the Mac compatibility was misrepresented by Amazon. Amazon claims that the program is usable on a Mac, but the box clearly states that one of the two discs (the one I was most interested in, the Math Games) is not Mac compatible.Another oddity about this package is the math flash cards that come with the program - there were no cards illustrating addition problems, only subtraction. Some of each would make more sense."
2,Disappointed,"I was terribly disappointed by the lack of any real content in this book. Barnes apparently glossed over everything in order to make a book which he could sell.I am an S&P day trader and the coverage of the S&P's in this book is petiful.There was nothing that I would reccomend in this book that you can't find in other better written offerings which you can find here (Abell for example).If you want to buy this book, you can have mine"
3,Duo505 - Late,"If B. Fleischmann's solo work is mostly about the pretty, then his work with Herbert Weixelbaum as Duo505, brings the grit into the pretty. ""Tsip Tsap"" takes the melodic bits and sets them against a much harsher electronic grind, even as it devolves into chaos. ""Lsdj08"" starts out with a preset rhythm, and as the strings build, in comes the 8-bit electro flavors. LATE seems to bounce between these poles -- the melodic covered under a layer of hiss and distortion and video game blippery. ""Facing It"" has almost a mechanical, industrial feel before the main theme comes in, and even the guitar on ""Toru Okada"" disappears under the noise. ""Nochwas"" goes for the game-feel again, this time with a pounding beat, and the final track, ""Disco + Bett"" has its bell-tones swimming amongst heavy distortion. Maybe not to everyone's taste, but worth a listen."
4,Soundtrack Spoonful,"This CD is a must for Spoon-heads desiring an archive of their original film work. Well-recorded/reproduced, too."
2,art of public speaking 8th edition-sent wrong book to me,"the book u sent was the 8th editon I wanted the 10th edition I gave u the isbn# my class use the 10th edition it was too late to be sent back to you so I have to use a book in class that is not what everyone else has and it doesn't have everything the others have in their book, I will not use your sight again, I've shared the mistake with others and my instructor. I don't have the money to go purchase a new book that's why it was suggessted that I use you, but now I'm dissapointed in the service.Terry Robinson"
5,NOT for mainstream panzies,"This album is excellent. One of the year's best. The guitar has a nice heavy sound, and can get suprisingly melodic. The drums are great, fast and percise(i mean we are talking Raymond Herrera talent here). If you like death, hardcore, thrash, or just any kind of metal this is for you. This is highly recommended for fans of slayer, skinlab, machine head, pissing razors, and S.O.D."
5,A book to be experienced,"I cannot adequately describe what it was like for me to have experienced Celestial Harmonies, but I will try:Part I is deceptively simple in its reduction of several generations of Esterhazy men (father, grandfathers, great grandfathers, etc) into ""father"" and ""son."" Yet this narrative device allows us to experience Peter Esterhazy's own complex and wonderful family history first hand, with details presented in small ""chapters,"" often out of sequence from one another. These pieces coalesce and provide the reader with an ancestrial memory of this great aristocratic family.Part II is more linear in its presentaion, and focuses on Esterhazy men of the twentieth century and all that was lost to the ravages war, Communism and revolution. It provides a glimpse into a time and a place in the world that I don't often hear about(in the US).Celestial Harmonies is a most rewarding experience and I highly recommend it."
1,Not durable,"I bought this cable from Amazon in month of Aug, 2007 for $10. It stopped working in May 2009. Now I have to buy another cable. This is my first cable which I am going to throw in trash so soon."
3,Soundtracks that don't have the sounds,"I was expecting a lot of catchy tunes from 80's songs and a good cover of he's a whore, but some of the best songs have been left out??? This is typical of the certian labels for example Replacement Killers. All that was on that soundtrack was composed music - who wants to listen to that? Where were all the R&B songs and new age rock tunes. Maybe the labels should ask the public to review the songs on the albums before they release it."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS,"I have a paper to write for an African American art class at school. The topic? Senga Nengudi. This article? Completely useless. Everything found in this ""article"" is available elsewhere for free. I got ripped off, and am writing this review only to prevent you from being suckered into handing over nine dollars and ninety-five cents."
2,Where's the beef?,"""Mom's Guide to Football"" is only a laminated pamphlet; I was disappointed that it was so short. The good part is that the lamination makes it water resistant for using at games. However, the info is brief and can pretty much be memorized easily. Also, $4 for shipping is insane. It should have been sent U.S. Mail for 37 cents - it fits in a business sized envelope. However, it was mailed in a large box. Greatly overpriced and I was greatly disappointed."
4,Very basic guide,"I bought this guide for a friend of mine who said, ""Oh, I love coming to your football games, but I don't know the first thing about the game, so I never know what I'm watching."" It has a very high-level outline of basic offense and defense with a description of each position. There's a list of common penalties with brief descriptions. It has a glossary of common terms & a list of football equipment, although the latter seems to be intended for use as a shopping list when Mom goes to the sporting goods store. And it all fold flat like a map!Don't get this for someone who knows what a first down is; that's how high level it is..."
3,What is that White Line?,"I love the 5 discs carousel dvd changer. It doesn't look bad either. However, I did not notice much difference on the picture quality using the HDMI input compared to the component connection I was using before. One thing that I do not like about this new Sony is that everytime there is a caption, a white line appears on and off on the tv screen. I do not know if this unit is defective or has incompatibility issues with the rest of my system. To be safe, I returned the product to Amazon and they were considerate enough to agree in reimbursing the shipping cost."
1,Disappointing,"I received this player as a prize, and was really looking forward to using it. It worked fine for about 2 weeks, then the ""locked"" message was displayed on the unit, and the tray would not open. I followed the directions in the manual, which didn't work. I unplugged the unit, which didn't work. Finally, I contacted Sony, who told me that it would need to be sent in for service. After searching for a solution online, I've found that this is not an uncommon problem. I wouldn't recommend taking a risk with your money on this Sony."
3,Cut Glass Value guide,"I ordered this book to help me identify vintage cut glass patterns. Although the line drawings are somewhat helpful, they were too busy, to be of value, for me."
1,warning: contains parabens,"When this product arrived, I glanced at the ingredients and noticed it contains methylparaben and propylparaben. Both are known carcinogens that can be absorbed through the skin. It's beyond me that these substances have not been banned in consumer products, but they seem to be everywhere, including anitbacterial soaps and many lotions. So, I threw it away and experimented with some alternatives.For a better, cheaper buffing cream, try one of the following homemade recipes.* 1 teaspoon olive oil + 1/2 teaspoon powdered white clay (kaolin)Mix together to make smooth paste. Massage into nails and cuticles, then buff as normal. You can find kaolin at health food stores or online.* 1 tsp. toothpaste + 1/2 tsp. lemon juiceMix together. Massage into nails and cuticles. Wipe off excess, then buff as noraml."
5,Tiny Toons,I watched it when I was little and it was funny so I bought it for my kids!!! Definitely recommend it for yours!!
3,Vesey leads the largest slave rebellion in the U.S.,"David Robinson attempts to define the life of Denmark Vessey. Since Vessey is little known, and not much has been written about him, this short book attempts to define what motivated Denmark Vessey to try to lead on of the largest slave rebellions. Good background material about Barbados and Charlestown's links with the slave island. One of the previous reviewers called Vessey a Haitan, but his name indicates origin in the Danish Virgin Islands, as Robertson asserts. Because his origin is so obscure, Robertson puffs up what is known and makes it book length. More research could have led to a more interesting book. However Robertson does shed light on an interesting time in U. S. History."
2,Its a soundtrack don't forgrt it,"Sorry I bought this not because it bad or anything just not the songs I was looking for. Obviously I should have be more diligent in looking over the song titles. I was hoping for a better audio of her songs and it is but the original music is so-so.La Vie en Rose in English doesn't cut it.Great film, really great"
5,Awesome Read!,"I thought I knew it all... until recently! My girlfriend bought ""Tickle His Pickle"" for me as one of my bachelorette gifts. In the book, the author definitely covers the art of pleasing your man's penis. I learned lots of new great techniques (and I already know a lot). And just the added touches of what you can do to make it even more exciting makes me enthused! Doesn't even matter if your experienced or not,I think this is a great book to refer back to from time to time. The illustrations are great, fun and cute and she covers everything you need to know from shaving your man, to giving great handjobs and how to make it more exciting when he comes! Showed my fiance' and we were excited to try something new each love session, I even picked up her other 2 books (Tickle your Fancy and Toygasms!) and really looking forward to checking it out before my honeymoon!!!!"
5,Fun reading,This book was informative and fun to read. Even if you think you already know there is always something new to learn.
3,"Although this book is from 2002, we're still not passed this...not then, and not now...","Visible Spirits was released in 2002, and although based in the earlier part of the century, the theme behind it still rings true today. There are distinct lines between race, sex, and blood presented in Yarbrough's book. But Yarbrough's characters definitely stand out as the typical ""black"" and ""white"" stereotypes that we still see in the headlines today.Yarbrough paints each character nicely as Tandy Payne goes against Loda Jackson for her postmaster job. Tandy's feeling on race and the fact that Loda is black makes for a layered conflict, despite the fact that they also share a common father.The storylines presented here are unique, but the theme itself dates back farther than Faulkner or any other Southern literature genius who embraced the race struggle in their writing. Kudos to Yarbrough for attempting it again, but the book as a whole is nothing new we haven't read before and won't see again."
4,What is going to happen now?,The fall of the Soviet Empire and the rise of the new great powers. Will there be a war...What will be in the 21st century. This book gives you different opinions and scenarios about what is going to happen.I enjoyed reading this book but this book won't help you if you're looking for something much more realistic and sophisticated.
1,does not fit sccy cpx2,"I did not buy one of these from amazon, but tried one in my local gun shop. IT WOULD NOT FIT MY SCCY CPX 2. However i tried a couple of other ones and the TA-M fobus holster for the Taurus Millennium 32, 380, 9mm fit perfectly."
3,Great... for awhile,"This was great for awhile. My cat seemed happy with it, but after a few gentle washings the stuffing began to shift and lump together. Then the sides would no longer stay up. Now it can only be used in the folded position (my cat hasn't complained about the lumps yet). If the bottom pad had been removable I would have washed just that and vacuumed the rest. No doubt it would still be 'convertible'."
1,not good,"The only band I could compare this band with is the Shaggs. By listening to both of them, it's evident neither of them know how to play their instruments. This band sounds to me like a bunch of bitter, old geezers who just got laid off and are trying to make some money by claiming they are musicians, when in fact, they can't carry a tune at all."
1,not worth all the hype,"I have heard much better indie music than this. The vocals are annoying, they sound like something off a childrens show, and sometimes you might think scratching a chalk board or playing your favorite recording backwords would be more pleasureable to listen to. and no, i am not saying this because of their recent stand on napster. i am saying this because their ""music"" is utterly horrible. i can see why they did go after napster, they needed some sort of big promotional boost or what not. well whatever, don't buy this if you're a sane regular person. However, if you're a Shaggs fan (you are also seeking mental help too), this one is a must have."
4,Not your ordinary orange,"I bought this disc after hearing some tracks on MP3.com. Well worth the money. This guy writes songs. I particularly like the different styles he hits: some hardcore, some light fingerpicking, some surf, and some wacked out groove things. If you like your music with a twist, get this one."
1,Disappointing,"I don't see how a 3 YO could possibly assemble/manuver/""fix"" this train. Yes, of course I, my husband, my son's 16 YO Aunt and her friend all helped to put it together, what a project. Not good on carpet, the track does not stay together and when it breaks, so does my 3 YO's patience. Toymakers need to cater to little ones, esp. with Thomas, but this is just a bit much for a child under 5, or a parent over 30!! Check out any of the GEO Trax systems, they are awesome and much easier for a lil' one to assemble, sorry Thomas, you blew it this time!!"
2,Bobs Rigging and Crane Handbook,The price was o.k. however when I took delivery of the book I was shocked to find that the print in it was so small I have to use a magnifiying glass to read it. Perhaps it is designed to be used out in the field but being so small I can't imagine it could be of any use. Rather disappointing.
5,N.W.A - Greatest Hits,"Nice! All dope N.W.A songs on one album. I had to pick this album up without hesitation. I highly recommend this album to all West Coast rap fans, and any old school fans.I love the lyrics on this album, all the members came w/ energy and heat. They talk on topics mainly pertaining to women, police, and other wack people.The production is definately off the hook! All dope beats, ""Real Ni**az Dont Die"" has a really dope beat. This album beat wise is definitely full of good beats.Make sure to pick this album up, there's no way you can be dissapointed with it.My Top 5 Songs1.F*** The Police2.Gangsta Gangsta3.Alwayz Into Somethin4.100 Miles And Runnin5.Real Ni**az Don't Die"
1,The Blue Balloon-What does it mean?,"After reading The Blue Balloon by Frank Asch, I asked myself over and over again, what exactly was this book about? I wonder if the book has some connection with the Vietnam Era (published, 1971)? Why is the balloon green and not blue? It is difficult to pinpoint the plot or purpose of the story. It is my opinion, that the book is not appropriate for young children because of this. I also found it especially disturbing when the main character enters the scene with a gun. what is that telling our children? I guess, I simply do not understand the whole structure or purpose of this book. Can anyone explain? I value Frank Asch as a writer and he has written many wonderful books that are on my children's shelves, as well as, the shelves in my classroom. But, this book has me baffled!"
5,When the brain is on your mind,"What a great book for educators. There are so many claims about what the brain is responsible for (nature versus nurture), it is fantastic to go to one source to separate the fact from the fiction. I find I use the handbook a lot in my lectures, but it is also a great everyday resource when I find that I have the brain on my mind."
2,Wrong information....too bad,"Unfortunately the author put incorrect information in this book. Too bad I really enjoyed it.I know someone in the Speech and Language Field, and her jaw dropped at some of the things she read about. A good majority of the section on ""reading"" is off. The author states numerous falsehoods, essentially stating the most research supports the ""whole language method"", when in fact the National Reading Panel in 2001 states the exact opposite. In addition, practically everything the author said about dyslexia is wrong. To those of you familiar with dyslexia, you know that it is a deficit in phonological processing and that the best treatment targets the deficit. The author recommends whole language which does not work for a child with dyslexia...EVER!!! Frustrating!!!With that being said, I enjoyed some other parts of the book, which did have correct information. It is just hard to trust most of the book when you know there are some elements of it that are way off."
4,A good intro,"Most of this manual is general information, it does not go into the specifics like biochemistry, histology, and anatomy, but covers most topics in a way that you get a general understanding of the brains processes. It's fun to open at parties and read a page or to."
1,There is a third edition,I had to buy and return this book as I needed the third edition and this was the second edition. Perhaps you should only sell the most current edition? It would save A LOT of hassle for us students.The third edition is great though!
5,"Fellow ""brain-author"" had a lot of fun with this one!!!","Found it recently at Border's Books next to mine. Lent the old copy to a colleague after posting a review on the website neurostuff.com. Had to buy it again...enjoyed all the graphic examples even the second time around. The material is easy to read and the information is well documented in the scientific literature. Recommend ""The Care and Feeding of Your Brain"" for a short summary/update of similar material...all the best to Dr. Howard and colleagues!!!...Kenneth Giuffre MD, author, ""The Care and Feeding of Your Brain"""
5,Outstanding presentation and development,This book helped me to really understand beyond the conceptual level. This book will guide the reader through the different aspects of analysis and design of power electronics systems without left behind the very practical hints. The course slides from the book web site are an excellent resource for instructors using this book. I dare my self to say that this book after Kassakian's is the best book in power electronics.
2,Not Durable!,"It worked ok for the first few days after we got it for our dog to play and walk in the snow and on the pavement with snow/salt.We realized that these boots are extremely hard to clean by hand. The salt and sand get stuck on the bottom of the boots because the bottom of the boots are not smooth. They feel like suede/fabric. Unless you toss them in the washing machine after every use, it is very hard to maintain them and dry them.After using for a few weeks, the bottom of the boots began to break. There are holes on the bottom towards the front of the boots (we do keep his nails clipped frequently). They are no longer waterproof anymore. The company's website stated that ""many dogs have worn their Muttluks for over three years"", but it only lasted just over a month for our dog. We never use them on dry pavement or concrete. We only use them to protect his feet from salt when there's snow.The boots are also not very easy to put on. It takes us about 10 min to put all of them on the dog."
1,Not durable,"They look OK, however, the glass separated from the stem after 2 uses. Not durable at all. Bummed that I gifted a set to my friend, of stuff that wouldn't last!"
5,Best Halloween Book Ever,"My 2.5 year old daughter and I love this book! Although we skip the page with the dragon, the illustrations, rhyming and story make it fun!My daughter loves the animals and loves to quote the book. Great reading for all ages."
1,"Brilliant, but naiive, minds","This is what happens when otherwise brilliant men venture into area where their ignorance outstrips their wisdom. Morrison and Tsipis are both well known and well regarded in physics and les sso in the realm of politics, and not at all in economics. Their solution for conflict and poverty assumes that every individual on the planet is, like themselves, a kind hearted, well-intentioned individual who will readily put their self interest aside for the betterment of others. Would that it were so.But it's not, and Morrison and Tsipis' naive utopian formula is no different from a thousand other utopian prescriptions. At best, they're ineffectual, and at worst, they lead to opression and dictatorship. For a more realistic view of the typical outcome of utopian societies, read Robert Conquest's ""The Great Terror""."
2,Missing Eucharistic Prayers,I was disappointed that this missing Eucharistic Prayers of Reconciliation I and II. There is also no indication of publication by Our Sunday Visitor.
2,Large Disappointment,I bought what I believed would be a complete missal. Imagine my shock to realize that the masses for reconciliation had been completely omitted! A huge oversight when the back is replete with all sorts of non-mass prayers.
1,Poor quality printing and binding,"My copy arrived. Its first page was p. 19. Several sections of the book were out of order; it was basically a mess. Other than that, Mrs. Lincoln.... :)"
2,A small morsel of useful information...,"This book I was somewhat pleased with. However, upon getting to the end of the book I was highly disappointed.The author discusses the Egun, the ancesteral spirits and how to honor and venerate them. He does so under the impression that we are not all related. While I can understand wanting to reconnect to your cultural heritage, and going so far as to mention science in this: the author forgets the fact that science does link all life to Africa. To preach that we need to get back to our roots, yet still remain in a divded state of mind with race, color, religion does not help this cause, only hinder it.The information found in this book can be found readily online, from various sources. It is however, a cute little book: BUT NOTHING MORE."
5,auto vacuum tubeing,The tubeing came came to my house rather fast.It is very good quality.I took a utility knife and split some of it down the center.I then pushed the tube over thin walled metal like they make for stawberry pyrimid beds.This makes perfect guard so someone won't cut themselves when messing sround with the metal.I ordered more than enough so I took the left over and made a fine misting tube out of it.
2,Lemmo o Lemmo,"Director James Lemmo attempts to make a neat little film about dream worlds, eighty year old couples, and out of body experiences. He fails miserably. Strange dream sequences with sheep and a half naked Jason Robards are the only plusses."
4,Awsome!!!,Love this movie! Much better then the first. Ya its straight to video and budget is smaller but its more fun i think! Buy it:)
3,drama,This movie is alright. Not nearly as good as the first one. But like I always say I'm a movie collector. So its a must to complete Ure collection.
2,I'm Requesting a List of Names and Quantity of Drugs that Corey Haim Took During This Film.,"Viewed: 12/11Rate: 412/11: Not as horrible as I initially suspected, Dream a Little Dream 2 shows very little relevance to the original. However, it does well for making time fly fast for me. I feel there is too much Corey Feldman in this one; it's too overdone because it is getting clear that he was trying to score future roles based on his ""range"" of acting. Needless to say, the tactic didn't work. Also, there is too much Michael Jackson going on here. In this one, it's apparent that Corey Haim was on drugs in the entire time. I just can see it in his eyes. All in all, you won't miss a thing if you skipped this one."
5,A vulnerable journey revealing new images for schooling,"David Loader invites us on a journey of new ways of thinking about education. He exchanges the four walls for more refreshing images such as circus, Cinderella, and Frog Prince'pals. As a teacher who loves his art, I could never imagine giving it up for an administrative role - until reading this book. I could actually consider an administrator as maybe having something valuable to offer to the educational enterprise. Loader's insights regarding technology provide thought-provoking possibilities for more creative and effective education located within home, business, and community contexts."
5,"Comfortable, Lightweight boot",I dread the break-in period of new boots as I walk all day in my work. These boots were comfortable right out of the box. No sore spots or blisters on my feet. They are surprisingly light-weight. I will likely buy another pair for just wearing around. Fast shipping and very reasonably priced.
3,Surprisingly well-made horror nonsense,"This is an oddly captivating farrago of horror and comedy, with Vincent Price camping it up as the eponymous doctor, determined to wreak revenge on the surgeons under whom his wife died.It's all rather gruesome and unpleasant, and yet at the same time, the film's dark, wicked sense of humour will surely raise a few laughs. Director Fuest milks the central character for all the pathos he can get, which only adds to the film's ironic undercurrent.For its genre, The Abominable Dr Phibes is surprisingly well-made, with high production values, including splendid art-deco scenery by designer Brian Eatwell and a fitting score by jazz musician Basil Kirchin."
3,not a bad phone,I was going to purchase one of these types of phones from Skype and they wanted $80.00!. I'm still in the process of adjusting the sound quality. So far it's not too bad except the tone of voices is off.
2,Too much potty humor,"I don't know...I was already beginning to find Pollack's schtick tiresome when this appeared. Then this book, equally tiresome, adds to the mix an obsession with vomit. You know, reading through all these reviews I sort of wish Kathy Tontobreine would write a spoof about rock and roll. That would be funny."
5,"Neal Pollack, the Mel Brooks Of Literature","In his writing, Pollack plays with genre cliches just like Mel Brooks did. Instead of seeing Never Mind The Pollacks as the end-point of literature, as some critics seem to insist, look at it as the early work of one of our great satirists. Rock-n-roll is a little overplayed as a topic, but this book is still hilarious. I look forward to seeing Pollack's work develop as he takes on weightier material."
3,Do you own a karate school?,This is what should be playing if you own/run a bjj/grappling school. I really didn't find it that useful for much more but it's still a cool video.
3,"Not great, not bad","I'm in the middle of reading the first book of the trilogy (halfway through) and am rather enjoying it. You really get a sense of who Kristin is, her motivations, her fears, the depth of her soul. This movie disappointed me....The casting was wasn't very good, Kristin is supposed to be this very beautiful, young, supple , full of life young woman who inspires great passion in men, here she's rather plain, appears older, serious...Kristin is supposed to be in her teens, this woman looks like she's seen great hardship and is at least 30-something. Erlend is not the handsome, dashing knight in shining armor that seduces Kristin, here he looks to be in his forties, tired and weary...you don't get the same sense of who much Kristin loves this man as they are both rather boring in the movie. The acting was good, but really expected more from Liv Ullman...it just wasn't the epic drama I was expecting, just slow moving and dull"
4,"Nice, warm cape","This cape is nice and long and the fabric looks really cool. I used it for my little red riding hood Halloween costume. It's also decently warm. I wore it with only a little black dress and tights underneath in end-of-October Chicago, and I didn't freeze. My only complaint is that the velcro fastener at the neck has really sharp edges and kept scratching my neck and chin. When I got home I had to trim and round the edges of it with scissors. For how much this robe cost I wish the makers would have sprung for a button or a snap or something. Other than that, I was very happy with it. I'm definitely saving it for another Halloween or costume party."
3,A Mother's Love,"This was a good story by Jodi Picoult, but not a great one. I, like many of the reviewers here, did not feel much sympathy for the mother, Nina Frost. I don't want to give any of the storyline away but she does raise some interesting questions in this book regarding the issue of ""an eye for an eye"" and just how far a parent will go for their child.The writing style was wonderful and I am always impressed with the way that this author can draw you into a story. I felt that some things in this novel did not ring true however and the characterization was not up to par. Overall, an enjoyable book. Her previous works have been better however."
4,My second Picoult book,"The first Picoult book I read was The Pact, and I loved it! I was hooked!Perfect Match was the second I read, and liked it almost as much as the first, but The Pact will always hold a special place in my heart =)Perfect Match was the perfect combination of intrigue, basic life emotions and court-room drama.I have bought it as a gift for a few friends because I enjoyed it so much.I look forward to even more novels for Jodi!"
1,Why read it -- NOW?,"I like to read the reviews given by others to help find a good book to read -- one that quite a few people have read and enjoyed. I have read several books based on others reviews on ths site and have been completely satisfied. However, after reading the first review for this book (and a few others that followed) why should I even bother reading it? The first review told the entire story, including the parts that should be left to read and discover for yourself. I can't imagine reading this book now that story has been told in too much detail by a reviewer. Thanks for spoiling a possibly good book."
5,A Great Author!,"I was not aware of all the great writers in this world.....I'm just now getting to read her novels, and love all I've read. Looking forward to the rest I've gotten. My purchase came in great shape! Thanks for the opportunity to be able to order from your company, and not have to get out in cold weather!"
2,Don't give up on her yet!,"I enjoy reading books that Jodi Picoult has written. This particular book, however, disappointed me to no end. The idea of the story was excellent; it just wasn't developed fully. This book was more of what would happen to her if it was a perfect world. I found myself irritated and annoyed by Nina Frost. I actually hoped for a different ending. Usually, Picoult stays within the realm of reality. With this novel, however, she completely steps into her fantasies."
3,Not so perfect of a hit for Jodi Picoult....,"OK, I like thrillers and mysteries and books with bite and cutting edge plots. This had the ingredients but fell a bit short. The characters were all but unlikeable and I had a hard time drumming up support for them or the desire to cheer Nina to acquittal. She just wasn't all that compelling as a heroine. The other characters were stereotypes and like cardboard, even her son. This book was decent. I found the story a bit implausible and all the things that fell together and the happy ending just a bit too predictable. I didn't predict one thing, must be getting slow or just not paying attention. The characters weren't really too interesting and I didn't find them very sympathetic nor did I care what really happened. Obviously Nathaniel should have been receiving ongoing psych counseling....."
1,"Shallow, disingenuous","Graphic, spoilers. Everything is wrong with this story.1.If an author is going to cover abusive clergy, she should get it right. Granted, abuse could include grabbing an extremely young child and raping him, but that happens rarely, if ever. Ms.Picoult took the easy way out when she set up the abuse as a grab and rape scenario.2. Momma and daddy should have noticed something more than a sudden lack of speech. How about symptoms of tearing, such as bleeding, drainage, and pain.3. The happy family scenario at the end of the story doesn't wash, unless Ms. Picoult wanted us to view her protagonists as total narcissists. They weren't going to be a normal happy family. Mom was still a murderer. How will she explain to her child why she killed an innocent man.This is the third Picoult novel that I have read. All of them were awful. She takes the cause dejour, and sets up scenarios to tug the heartstrings. Mostly, they gave me heartburn."
4,"quirky, cute and under rated","I found this film a lot of fun to watch. True, it certainly isn't great by any stretch of the imagination but it has the great Robert Downey in it. I certainly don't agree or condone Downey's personal life but the man certainly can act...make no doubts about that!...and Natasha Gregson Wagner is wonderful. This beautiful and talented young woman seems to be greatly under rated just as her mother, the Glorious Natalie Wood was."
1,Two Girls and a Guy,"Two Girls and a Guy is a horrendous film that indulges itself in terrible and appalling dialouge that is as uninteresting and foolish as anything in recent cinema. The movie is based and is dragged through by a pretentious script that never captivates, moves or surprises. The film, it seems, almost makes a point to push the viewer away, so it can continue exhaustingly, with its own uninteresting world. The movie begins with two women finding out that they've been dating the same man for over ten months without knowing it. When he returns to his apartment, the girls confront and yell at him for the next hour and a half. For my ears' sake, I put the film on mute for about a fourth of it, after I realized that it was going nowhere at all. A terrible, terrible film with the exception of Robert Downey Jr.'s better- than- average performance."
4,RDJr is amazing,"RDJr showed his true talents in this movie. The script was amazing too. Heather Graham had some weak acting scenes, but overall, she did fine. The ending leaves you wanting more, but makes you THINK and examine the rich content of the conversations. I highly recommend this film to people who love indies."
3,This movie was like a play,"Because it is very claustrophobic, It takes place in Robert Downey's apartment. The acting was very good. Robert is so good it's a shame that he ruins himself the way he does. Heather is adorable as always. Natashia Gregson Wagner blew me away. I thought she was Natalie Wood's ghost, she is the mirror image of her mother. And a good actress too, I hope to see her in more movies soon. She has a lot of potential to become one of the great actress of this era. One of the star's children that actually has real talent and not just riding on the fame of famous parents."
1,"Run, Don't Walk from this Awful, Awful Film",I think I'd rather sit through a root canal than watch this horrific film again. James Toback has to be the worst writer/director at work today. Even talented Robert Downey Jr. is wasted. AVOID AT ALL COSTS.
1,Two Girls + One Guy= Massive Headache,"Whine, Whine, Whine. Boring comedy tries to be compelling and smart, but I wouldn't spend ten minutes with these three idiots, much less the hour and a half running time. A failed stage play disguised as satire."
2,The first 30 minutes is hilarious and entertaining. Then it becomes so unrealistic and boring that it's hard to watch.,The first 30 minutes is hilarious and entertaining. Then it becomes so unrealistic and boring that it's hard to watch.It's worth viewing for curiosity.
1,two awful actresses and a terrible movie,"This film doesn't deserve a review. It's awful, plain and simple."
2,Could nott keep them on!,"I have a small terrier, and I wasn't able to keep the Muttluks on his feet. I had to keep turning around on our walk to search for one or two missing ones. I guess his legs are just too skinny, but I couldn't have possibly made them any tighter. I was hoping to protect him from the prickly things in the desert. I'm disappointed."
2,GOOD but not GREAT,"Unlike other boots, these do remain on your dog during walks, but they are not the least bit durable. I purchase them in the winter to protect my dog's paws from snow and salt. By month 2 they are completely falling apart. So, prepare yourself to spend money on a relatively expensive product that has little to no lasting power."
1,B.S.,"Just FYI for anyone thinking of purchasing this book- Lovecraft was born in 1890, ""Haunter of the Dark"" was published in 1936. The date of publication is way off."
5,Fabulous book! What a gem!,"I'm usually disgruntled by how little useful information is in art instruction books, but this book is chock full of practical, useful information. This is the best art instruction book I've ever read. Those who have a lot of difficulty with technical subjects might have trouble understanding this book. Otherwise, it's fairly easy to understand. Does anyone know of any other top notch books available that cover perspective techniques not included in this book?"
2,I WAS NOT IMPRESSED,THE PICTURE SHOWS A 1911 IN THE CASE. IT WIL FIT A 1911 BUT IT IS A BOOGER TO GET THE MAGAZINE IN AND CLOSE THE CASE. I WOULD HAVE RETURNED THE PRODUCTS (I BOUGHT TWO) BUT IT IS TOO MUCH OF A HASSLE. I'LL USE THEM FOR SOMETHING.
4,"PJ Wannabe, Like You'd Know!","To all the weenies who have never come any closer to the Air Force than an airshow get off your high horse! FYI, in Clancy's 'Debt of Honor' they send in one guy on a C-17. Give me a break! In case you didn't notice, Salazar's Drop Zone is a work of fiction (a darn good one at that!) If you're one of us who've ""been there, done that"" then you'll find yourself quickly enveloped in the plot. As for PJ's, I can tell you that they are a breed apart. I've worked w/SEAL's, Ranger's, Army Special Forces (Green Beret's), and CCT Teams (another Air Force special operations outfit). PJ's are a cut above them all and it's about time their story is told. I can personally attest that reading this is a close to a ""real world"" mission feeling as you'll come."
5,Evaluation of the CD Beautiful world by Sara Jorge,"Good. It is almost new. The audio is perfect. There's a lack of mixes or extended mixes, but the radio edit is good and enough. Besides there's on the CD a song ""To be loved"", very good."
3,Hmmm.,"While the book has great information, it was all fairly vague and moved from one thing to another very quickly. I also didn't like the fact that there was no mention that it was written by a pastor and begins each chapter with a bible verse. While there is ABSOLUTELY NOTHING WRONG WITH THAT, I would have liked to know up front that it is a Christian book. I have NOTHING AGAINST CHRISTIANS OR ANY OTHER RELIGION. I was just surprised. That is all."
3,For the kids...,"The Sarah Jane Adventures are really for kids. True, they have lots of cool explosions and humor and aliens and the lovely Elisabeth Sladen. 4 discs holding the first season episodes plus tons of extras this is a great way to get your children into the universe of Doctor Who. From this series you could have them see the old black and white episodes or go to the Fourth Doctor episodes. Not saying you would not enjoy it as an adult. I mean, it is Sarah Jane Smith, hubba-hubba, but you may find some parts just too silly or unrealistic. Yes, I said unrealistic while talking about Doctor Who - what am I thinking? Yet there is that sonic lipstick and all kinds of other devices, like Mr. Smith. There is a few twists and turns in the plot and the last episode has a huge one.Enjoy!"
3,Runs small,"This is a good rain hat. Its a little goofy fitting and looking, not what I expected from Acorn. A little on the small side"
4,Conversation by Grapelly,Grate CD! Grate music. Bring my soll out. Only one disapointment. Best songs from the vinal record missing on it.
4,uncle moishy,"wow is that all only 12 million what a deal , this has to be the best buy in the world so try it you wont believe it is this low of a price"
3,Typical Microsoft,"After having this book for only one day, I gave up and returned it. There are numerous editing errors throughout. For instance, In the middle of the Outlook 2000 section, some color-coded guide tabs and page headings read ""Access 2000"".Also, the index refers to wrong or misplaced pages. Further searching reveals particular index entries are nowhere to be found. Clearly rushed to press without much editing or forethought. Office 2000 ""Professional""? Hardly."
2,Wow...,"I love horror movies, and for some reason I'm addicted to horror movies that no one has ever heard of...because sometimes you can find a good gem every now and again. But in all honesty...wow. This was terrible. The acting is horrible, the story line is aweful (not to mention very confusing), and it just wasn't scary at all. I have to admit, in the beginning I thought it might wind up being creepy, but I was wrong. Save your money on this one, at least I only spent seven dollars on it. The only reason I gave it two stars was because it gave my husband and I a chance to cuddle. Other than that, I wish I would have skipped this one."
2,Half of it works.,The surface scanner seems to work fine. I'm working on checking its accuracy. The temperature probe does not work. Very disappointing. Almost burned two meals.
1,BORING,"If you want to waste your money then spend it on Sundaresan.This book is highly disappointing. If your professor tells you buy it then you can tell him or her to .....If you want to master fixed income securities, then you only need to purchase one and only one book, namely ""Fixed Income Securities: Valuation, Risk Management, and Portfolio Strategies"" by Martellini and Priaulet. That's the best book out there."
1,There is a reason...,... why this book is getting few stars here at amazon. It is absolutely terrible! Read it at school and was tricked to buy it. Among the 40-50 academic books I have read this is the worst. Totally unorganized and so badly written that you believe the book was written as a project in grammar school.
3,Untensing meditation,"The only guided meditation on this CD is the kind where you sit or lay down and someone tells you to unclench your muscles one by one. I thought it was more of a guided journey sort of CD. I justed wanted to pass on that it's more of ""now relax your neck, let yourself go..."" sort of work. The music is relaxing and the woman's voice pleasant, with a sort of accent that lends itself to the meditation. It just wasn't what I thought it was."
5,Kiss the Master's Hand!!!,"I must admit, i have only seen Swept Away... and Seven Beauties from this collection, but Wertmuller is the best Italian filmmaker i have experienced. I picked up this collection today and cannot wait to see the other films, tho why some of the films are in widescreen 4:3 and some are formatted for 16:9 is lazy."
2,a cacophony of music & images,"I was deeply disappointed with this video. I purchased it to learn about Seville. The video cover reads ""Museum City Videos: Seville, Jewel of Andalusia: A Tour of the city seen through the eyes of its artists, architects and poets."" This is NOT what the purchaser receives! The video does have the usual lovely, even breathtaking shots of Seville, accompanied over 90% by the most annoying background music you've ever heard. This is not a documentary. There is a narrator who comes in very very occasionally and has a vague word to say. But this is not an educational video by any stretch of the imagination. You see numerous pictures without ANY explanation of what you are viewing AT ALL. The average American high school Western Civ student gets more than this from her textbook."
5,They finally perfected the Swiss Army Knife!,"I've always complained for years about how swiss army knives don't have a locking blade. I managed to cut myself a couple times with another model because it didn't have a locking blade, not with this beast though! The quality of this tool is superb. The knife was sharp right out of the box and hasn't gone dull on me yet. I've used this to fix all sorts of little things around my apartment. It has a little weight to it, so it's best to get the leather pouch or just keep it in your backpack like I do. All the tools work well and do their job well. I have no complaints!"
4,Best cable locking system,"APC/Kryptonite has a real winner with the 8mm lock. What makes this lock stand head and shoulders above the rest is the separate locking barrel that allows you to snugly secure the lock mount in the micro security slot. I have found that while the slot itself is the same size, the tolerances of the wall thickness on each device varies. The QuickMount barrel ensures a snug, secure grasp in the security slot. The lock housing securely attaches to the QuickMount barrel, but also allows the cable to swivel such that the cable is not in your way.Kensington invented the slot and lock, but APC/Kryptonite now owns the best lock design--bar none; that's my opinion."
3,The old west without the Hollywood glitter!,"A true western yarn with color, history and people you can imagine really lived back in ""Sweetwater, AZ"". I think author Kemp was born 200 years too late!"
4,Great entertainment !!!!,"So far, I have bought the first three sets, and plan to buy the rest. It is very nice to be able to go back in time and see TV shows without the too often gross scenes of today. Video and audio quality is excellent. I wanted to rate it 5 stars, but unfortunately the commercial prompting markers were left in these DVD's, marring the upper corners from time to time. Thankfully, the commercials are missing. If you have an old TV, which cuts off the top, bottom and sides,you will never see these distractions."
1,so THIS is what they call Catholic fundamentalism,"While there were several insights in the book, I can't recommend it. Berquist, Hahn & Hasson have all said it better. And why did Dr. Clark include Gerry Matatics as a co-author???"
