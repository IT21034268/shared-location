2,ok -,Eh product is ok. had a little problems with it leaking where the hose met the funnel but did the trick for what i need to do.. If i was doing this as an every day thing i wouldn't get it.. spend the money on a better one!
4,Need some time to get use to,"I was debating between this one and Tach SV5W Gold. In our club we use Tach SV5W and it was good. I bought this one at first only because of its ""official"" title. The first day I played it, I really can't say I liked it. It feel much heavier than Tach SV5W Gold and a Molten I've tried. The leather surface feel very nice though. The second time I went to the court and just thought I would just give it another try. Amazingly, I started to like the heavy feeling. It doesn't immediately bounce off from my hand until the entire palm has tightly touched the surface of the ball. This kinda makes me feel more control. feel I am playing something substantial.In a word, good ball and worth a try."
2,Illegal cd?,"I like the CD but I get the feeling the artist/label/whatever didn't get any money from my purchase. The CD had a longish warning on it, I'll go look it up...""LICENSED FOR PROMOTIONAL USE ONLY - THIS CD HAS NOT BEEN SOLDYou may not transfer this disc without consent of record company and must return it on demand. Use or retention of the disc signifies acceptance of this license.""It is irresponsible of Amazon to illegally sell such a CD. Part of the reason I buy cd's (in this modern age of free internet radio &c.;) is to support the artist.SO buy this somewhere else.With that said, I bought this CD for the tracks 'not going anywhere' and mainly for 'end of may'. There are some other good tracks. I haven't really decided what I like out of it yet."
3,Buy her French albums first,"I had high hopes for this album, having heard an English version of ""La Corde et Les Chaussons"" on a plane a year ago, but found this very disappointing. I'd recommend that you get her two albums in French first (""Biographie De L. Philipsen"" and ""La Disparition"".)This album has some new songs but the 'stars' are English versions of songs from those two. The big problem is that the lyrics are ho-humm, which I find distracting. I've no idea whether the lyrics in French are any good, but without understanding the words I just hear her voice, which is astonishingly beautiful. She sings very quietly, so quietly that you can hear every mouth movement sometimes, superbly intimate. This works much better in French, the sounds just roll off her tongue more naturally.Oh yes, and the beautiful English version of ""La Corde et Les Chaussons"" (which had the refrain ""...need to know, if you love me... if you love me"") is not on this CD."
1,Received a Like Product but Not the Product Ordered,Disappointed that the product received was a like product (different brand) ... not the exact product ordered. I was not contacted about a replacement product.
2,"1 great, some good, many mediocre, a few lousy","Let me just say something about the best of the lot. Senator Sin's 1-800-yor-dick. Even though it reads like a female view of what is would be like to have one - hey, that is the purpose to the book...is it not? - I howled at the Senator's escapades. The price of the book is almost (not quite) worth this one poem. And I do think the book cover is clever and all...But, better luck on a second coming."
2,A shallow book,"Dick for a Day seemed to be five different repeating themes: 1. This is a dumb idea and I won't contribute (usually 1 or 2 sentences saying this). 2. Man Bashing, why men do this and women either don't need to or want to but feel they can't because they are not ""equipped"". 3. A light exploration of sex from the other side, with another woman, or man, or dildo, or masturbation, a few are interesting, but most are shallow and boring. 4. A brief justification for a gay/lesbian lifestyle, I have nothing against gays, but I see nothing in it either. 5. I'd call the written equivalent of modern art, hard to read, understand, follow, or simply see if there is a message in the ""art"". Dick for a Day was a diverting 3 hour read, but I'd suggest getting it from the library, not wasting $12 on the book"
1,DO NOT PURCHASE THIS BOOK! IT IS A FRAUD!!!,"The publisher is [...] These books are reprints based on material scanned from old books AND IT IS OUTRAGEOUSLY ILLEGIBLE!!! When you pick up the book you realize that no human has ever touched this to proofread it - the text went from an old book, through a scan, and onto this page - and you cannot understand it. There are goobly-gock typos in every line, no table of contents. Unbelievable what people do for money."
1,rip off,I purchase this guitar although it was just too small I sent austin an email for a ra number which he did and I sent it back and guess what no money so I got a little guitar which I don't have and the money too. I hope no one has to go through this because it really stinks. I will never order from this web site againcarol a king
4,Lots of fun!,"I agree with the previous reviewer's comments - many pieces to seem like they fit together, while in fact they don't. Personally, I think it adds to the challenge of putting this puzzle together. I picked it up last night and we had the border together in a few hours. The rest will be considerably harder, since it appears the image used for this puzzle is somewhat grainy (at least the dwarfs appear so...). This our first puzzle in years (I'm 30) but I'm happy with my purchase."
2,Gorgeous person meets gorgeous person,"Fortunately, I didn't buy this book but checked it out of the library (on my Kindle! So convenient!), thinking it was something different. All I can say is, I hope these two find they actually like each other, once the physical attraction fades."
5,A must-have book in a time of great dispare and turbulence!,"Before you grab the yellow pages or talk to friends about divorce lawyers, this book prepares you for going thru the whole process of divorce. Before you begin dealing with lawyers, you need to determine where to begin, how to go about it, what you need in way of a gameplan, finding your marital assets and property, etc.. With all the turmoil, embarrassment, frustrations and agony of being sued for divorce, this book gives you a grip on what you need to make the best out of a less than ideal situation. Mr. Knight's book does all this and more."
4,Ron Steals the Show,"Not bad for a Nicholas Cage fliuck. As with all these movies about the middle ages you must let go your hold on what was actually true to get through the flick. Decent action and I'd watch poop if it had Ron Perlman being a smart ass. I still remember him in ""Name of the Rose"". Great flick."
4,season of the witch,fascinating movie not what i expected. received movie promptly which was great because i could watch it sooner. prime condition.
3,Four star movie with a three star ending...,"Season of the Witch had all the elements of a great film - great premise, solid cast and Nicholas Cage is in form. The on screen pairing with Ron Perlman completely works too. So what gives? The movie starts off intriguingly - with a mix of buddy chemistry and an ominous mission with a Lord of the Rings tinge to it.As the movie develops however, somehow the ending - while not bad - kind of gives way to a slam-bang special effects scenario. In short, the stakes should've been way higher - and scarier. Still, Season of the Witch is a decent film to watch - Cage looks good as a Knight - and the film is eminently watchable (way better than the Brothers Grimm, the Highlander sequels and many other films). I've always enjoyed Cage's films and in this one, he still scores."
2,Were they kidding? The joke is on us,"I could not decide if this was a comedy or a parody. The laughs just kept coming, especially the sight of Nicholas Cage and his sidekick, Ron Perlman, as middle ages crusaders on a quest to deliver a witch to some monks for a trial. They kept stepping out of character to deliver wise-cracks straight from the streets of New York. Mercifully, this all moves fast and it's over in less than 90 minutes. Cage must have needed this payday to pay his tax bills. The effects are okay, but I kept wondering if this entire movie was a digital special effect."
3,"""You'll Be Buying Tonight My Friend"" ~ Defeat The Demon, Save The Girl","While no one will ever make the mistake of placing 'Season of the Witch' on a list of film classics, it is in my opinion a watchable and overall enjoyable storyline for anyone in the mood for a little something from the sword and sorcery film genre. Nicolas Cage and Ron Perlman are perfect in the role of two dis-illusioned Christian Crusaders who have recently disserted from a war and cause they found to be anything but holy. They make the perfect anti-heroes. The rest of the cast is also surprisingly good. I particularly liked the lovely Claire Foy in the role of the suspected witch. She conveyed a wonderful mix of innocence and evil that brought added depth and atmosphere to the screen and held my interest when I may have otherwise lost focus.Again, definitely not a classic and probably not something you'll want to watch over and over. But one viewing, why not?"
5,Wow,This is one of the best movies I've seen in a very long time! Fantastic story line and special effects!
3,Needs to be recut - less liberal with the scissors this time.,"There's a lot to like about this film: the cast, locations, setting, subject, the production as a whole appears easily servicable despite a rather dull script and all too predictable plot. But if you've seen the deleted scenes collected on the BD, it's apparent there's much greater potential here, than the shallow action/horror romp, just for people who've apparently never seen action/horror before, that could have made the film much more enduring and endearing on a broader, more profitable scale.If the director would only re-edit the film to include most of the cut scenes from the BD, I'd buy it again. As is, the replay value is pretty low without a more poignant, better developed story."
1,amazon is bad,i bought this wanting to download it because my internet it to slow to stream and it didnt work some content copyright bs i contacted them and they never fixed it its been like a month dont buy their crap i switched to itunes cheaper too
1,Weak,"The story was weak, good special effects (CGI). Not the worst movie Ive ever seen, but not good either.Maybe the people who write this stuff could do a better job. I think Sad is a good discription."
4,Much better than led to believe,"People are way too hard on this film. EVerything cannot be Lord of the RIngs nor should it be. This is a very entertaining little film. The ending was a bot cliche but whatever. I was very pleasantly surprised and happy that I rented. When the price drops I'll be buying the DVD. Feels like a fall movie, glad I watched today. First chilly day, end of summer, begining of fall kind of day..."
4,It's not a witch it's a ...,"While I'm not into dark things (like that witch that turned out to be something else), I think it was a very good movie which kept me worrying about the characters and kept me wondering what will happen next. It was very entertaining and the story was actually good. I dislike the fact that I didn't give the movie a chance before, because of bad reviews that I've read. The special effects were nice, environment was creepy and wolves were done pretty cool. Hopefully there will be another exciting and enjoyable movie like this one."
2,Should have borrowed not even rented it,"Nic Cage is no longer worthy of a leading actor, he hasn't made a good movie in forever, and the last good movie he was in was the Sorcer's Apprentice which thankfully he didn't star in. If he ever learned how to make more then the morose, depressed, or deeply saddened faces he might be ok, seriously even when he tries to smile it looks like he wants to break into tears. Thankfully Ron Perlman was halfway decent in it."
3,Amon Duul II - 'Nada Moonshine' (Mystic),"Decent mid-'90's reunion effort. Not as outstanding as some of their early works, but then again... This CD appears that Amon Duul II was trying to be perhaps more 'experimental'. Tunes here worth mentioning are ""Nada Moonshine Union"" (features some nice Yes-like harmony vocals, I thought), the rocking ""Sirens In Germanistan"", the catchy ""Black Pearl Of Wisdom"" and the jazzy ""Ca Va"". This disc is certainly not meant for the new fan. Mainly recommended for the patrons who dug and own at least four of their first eight landmark lp's. Line-up: Renate Knaup-vocals, Chris Karrer-guitar,sax & violin, Felice Occhionero-guitar, Lothar Meid-bass,vocals & synthesizer and Peter Leopold-drums."
1,Kindle price for the book,"There are better chances for this book to sell, if Amazon dropped the kindle price to 9.99. Why would I pay 65 USD for an electronic copy?"
5,great stories in the tradition of M.R. JAMES,"As Mr. Duffy explains in his excellent foreword, he had a lot of fun writing Jamesian spooky tales. But make no mistake.These are not parodies or even pastiches. Duffy takes on the mantle of Monty (his metaphor) and it fits him well.Many authors have tried with varying success to write Lovecraftian tales, but Duffy is the 1st modern writer to that I know of to try to recreate the work of the greatest ghost storyteller of all time.And he succeeds beautifully. Wish he would produce another volume of these superb ghostly stories. All the elements are present: the Oxbridge scholars, the antiquarians, the mysterious manuscripts.In short, this book is a trip to the past for all us lovers of Victorian /Edwardian supernatural fiction.,"
5,"A History of Monroe County, West Virginia","Anyone researching his or her family in West Virginia will be fascinated with the biographical sketches for the founding families of Monroe County. In many cases the family origins are detailed and, mention is made of where some relocated after leaving the county.Mr. Morton includes details on flora, fauna, local government and geographical information.This book also is a good purchase for history buffs."
4,"Classic Alpine Rucksack, Made from the Dana Designs Mold!","Great easy to use daypack!PROS: Light, Style-istic, Easy to pack and wear, Removable hipbelt (on this older model only-not the newer models), Color coded hipbelt straps are handy when in the field.CONS: Lid doesn't cinch down fully on loads (or when the pack ""isn't"" stuffed to the brim. I call it the ""floating lid"" syndrome found on almost all lid packs that don't have sufficient or well design compression straps. You can remedy this by adding your own cinch straps over the main opening (but under the lid). See the packs made by GRANITE GEAR, where the lid is purchase-optional, and you'll get what I mean.compression strap clips are extra big and doofy."
3,Sam at her best,"""Don't need you to(tell me I'm pretty"" was a poor choice as a single after having two hits, ""Gotta tell you"" and ""Baby come over"", and maybe she thought it was time to release a ballad but why doing this when she still has some great songs that were singles in other parts of the world to be released? Body II Body would have been a great choice! Also ""Always come back to your love"" which spent like 2 months in the Top 10 in Europe, she even wasted ""The Boy Remix"" as a b-side on this single and it could have been a single by itself! However if you own the old edition of this album it doesn't hurt if you buy this cd-single since these songs aren't in that, but if you do own the new yellow edition then don't buy unless you are a die hard fan."
2,Good premise but too repetitious,"The premise put forth by the author that stockholders are really nothing more than speculators who are serendipitously granted the rights of owners and that employees should be counted as owners just as much as stockholders is spot on. The problem is that she takes over 200 pages of dead trees to basically repeat this assertion over and over again. Lacking a historical perspective of the labor movement she relies on catch phrases from Thomas Paine, Thomas Jefferson and other 18th century political philosophers. Her suggestions about how to achieve employee parity with stockholders is sophomoric at best.For a much more profound analysis of the huge cost to society of global fascist multinational corporations read David Korten'sWhen Corporations Rule the World"
2,Another glossy picture book,"Seems less than half the examples are houses; the rest are studios, guest houses, or cabins. All stylishly spare and uninviting. And while there are occasional floor plans and elevations, and about two detail drawings, the emphasis is on the pictures. You'll finish this book in about 20 minutes and wonder why anyone would spend money on these unlivable houses."
1,worst fryer ever,"Let's see, where to startVery thin, cheaply made, instruction book makes no sense, no numbers for temperatures, basket does not fit into fryer unless tipped, and handle falls off, will not latch, very risky for burns & fire hazards. I am returning today to Amazon. Whoever Chef pepin is should try it in his kitchen, LOL."
2,Product description is misleading,"This product has no temperature settings for slow cooking nor for the other features it says it will do. The only dial settings are for deep frying and the enclosed instruction manual also only gives directions on the use of it as a deep fryer only. The manual also says not to leave the unit on for more than 3 hours and most slow cooking takes more than 3 hours. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS ITEM. The concept of slow cooker, steamer, deep fryer, etc in one unit is a great idea but this unit does not do what it advertised..I am very disappointed in the misleading description. I requested a replacement as it was not as advertised and the second unit was identical so I returned it also...Now I am waiting on my refund..."
4,book review on Departure from the Script,Very ineresting topic and relatively well-written (I don't care for words that are split incorrectly at the end of a line - very distracting!). Quick read - would recommend this if you are looking for something unique and meaningful.
5,a nice addition to out train table,a nice addition to out train table. it fits well with our imaginarium train set. would recommend it to others.
4,get the Pioneer release of this movie!,"Even though the Pioneer DVD is long out of print and might be more expensive than the readily available Artisan release, you should make the effort to track the out of print disc anyway!Why bother?Well, the Pioneer release includes the R-rated and Unrated versions of the film, a commentary with Brian Yuzna,Jeffrey Combs, and a bunch of others involved in the making of Bride of Reanimator. Also, there are things like conceptual drawings, behind the scenes footage, outtakes,etc.The Pioneer 'Special Edition' truly deserves that label."
2,Mediocre sequel to a excellent original,"This tepid,disappointing sequel is far better than Beyond the Re-Animator but dosen't equal a good sequel to the excellent original. Dr.Herbert West and his friend Dan re-animate dead bodies and when Dan's girlfriend is dying she is re-animated just like Bride of Frankenstein. The gore effects are good including the crawling eyeball but the movie becomes tedious and more predictable as it goes along. The new director Brian Yuzna does a good job taking over Stuart Gordon but this movie fails to entertain and make watchable that this looks like a Sci/Fi channel movie that would debut on TV and the movie is just disappointing compared to the first with a new cast(Except Jeffrey Combs and Bruce Abbott),lower production values and lower budget,and tepid to atrocious acting. If you seen the first your not missing much but for some reason you can recommend this instead of Beyond the Re-Animator."
4,oh go finger this..no no eyeball that,"You have to give Jeffrey Combs alot of credit in both Re-animator and Bride of Re-animator, I mean the guy manages to keep a straight face throughout both films. (Unless he was laughing his butt off between takes).This movie is downright cool and outrageous chasing after the modern day Frankenstein..um I mean Franken..oh nevermind.The story is simple the two docs build a woman from spare body parts. She says at one point..""You built me??"" with the silly look on her face.My favorite scene was the fingers with the eyeball attached to itrunning around the room when that nosy cop was there giving the boys the 3rd degree. You'll like how he gets his..the die-electric detective..Anyway check it out plent of gore, silly dialogue oh and one fine looking babe.Thumbs up to H.P Lovecraft and his bizarre stories..yeah!"
3,More luminous serum into dead people and body parts.,"This is the sequel to Re-Animator (1985) made five years later.Jeffrey Combs returns as the mad doctor, Herbert West.With his colleague Dr. Dan Cain (Bruce Abbott) they are now in Peru, set eight months later after the massacre they created at Miskatonic Medical School. They go back to Miskatonic Hospital where Dr. West is once again testing his luminous serum on dead people and dismembered body parts.Dave Gale returns as the without-a-body Dr. Hill.DVD contains no extras or bonuses. Just ""Play"" and ""Scenes"".Followed by:Beyond Re-Animator(2003)."
2,Excellent film but terrible VOD.,Buying this download was a big disappointment. 4:3 aspect ratio and looks more like a vhs transfer than a DVD transfer. I can't wait until someone does a good blu ray of this one.
2,not the original,this geneon(pioneer) release is 96 min (r) and 97 min(unrated) is of not. the original is 99 min because i own a copy on vestron vhs(long out of print) and dvdfullscreen by lions gate given an r-rating(though it is still the uncut originalthough not widescreen).buy it if you like for the cool cover art.
2,"For a Myth book, it's not much...","Don't get me wrong, please; I'm a HUGE fan of Asprin's Myth series, and I was happier than anyone else to see a new Myth book! Unfortunately, though, it's not MUCH of a Myth book. Many of the characters suffer in this work, but Aahz seems especially flat and unconvincing. Asprin explains in his introduction that he needed to ease himself back into the series after such a long hiatus, and I certainly appreciate his artistic need to do so - but the book just isn't very good. Collectors, die-hard fans, and those with lots of cash could invest in a personal copy, but I would reccomend that the casual reader check a copy out of their local library."
5,"Wonderful Product, Slightly Over Priced!!","After getting prescriptions for clincial strength deodorants, trying herbals, organics, etc, I saw this in the store and although the price was high, I tried it, and I LOVE IT!! I think the scents are ok. I do, however, think that the price that you pay for how much you get is on the high side! It does work very well for me, and I will continue to use it. The price is the only draw back that I have found."
2,Save your money and buy something else instead!!,"I am 30 years old and I recently started having sweating problems. I have never really had this problem before so I was very disappointed to see sweat patches on my shirt under my arm. I wanted some help without prescription so I started shopping around and ended up with SECRET clinical strength in my shopping cart. It sounds good doesn't it?? Well I started to use the product ( I gave it 2 whole weeks..) and it is just useless and does not help at all. I wanted solution for my problem so I started checking the active ingredients in products and found out that SECRET clinical strenght is absolutely NO DIFFERENT from any other secret and other regular deodorants. It just have 3 % more of aluminium zirconium triclorohydrex in it!! So don't fall for the false advertisement it is nothing special, just a regular deodorant that works for those who have no sweating problem!!"
1,Yeah....don't waste your money.,"I finally recieved my sample of Secret Clinical Strength in the mail the other day and gave it a test drive. I've had bad sweating problems for as long as I can remember, and nothing's worked. I can add this deodorant to this list. It reduced my sweating a little. but the wet patches were still there. The active ingredient in SCS is only 1% more than the Ban I was using. Save your money."
3,"From another world, but still enjoyable kitsch","Two hours of froth from a time before the word gay became commonplace. Steve Guttenberg (lovely) gets pally with the Village People and spends the whole film in a state of high excitement at the thought of a disco revolution. Everyone acts as though they dont know that we know that they are gay. Strange, but still fun and compelling"
3,STINKS SO GOOD,"This film captures a moment in time that only a few other films manage to do. Think: THE WIZ, THE APPLE, XANADU. Great early 80's camp! Granted also technically cruddy but hey, the music, the dance numbers, the outfits! It's great for for a night of crappy entertainment that won't tax the brain."
4,The Village People's Music isn't Bad,"I actually enjoyed the movie. The plot isn't particularly good. But if You like Village People's music You'll like this and the cast is good. Parine, Jenner and Guttenberg are good together. And it's got some good humor too..."
1,So bad it's good? Hardly...,"Some movies are so inept and awful, that they're actually fun to watch. They have a certain charm that you feel like coming back to over and over again. That's not the case, however, with Can't Stop the Music. It's just truly, horribly awful. I'm sure the idea sounded good at the time. Disco was hot, the Village People were one of the hottest acts around, and Grease had just shown that a musical can still be a smash hit. While it may have been a good concept in theory, in practice it was just awful.With some truly awful movies, you can sit back, relax, and laugh at what makes them bad. With this, you are just so horrified at how abominable it really is that there's no way you could ever find any pleasure in watching it. It's painfully, sickeningly bad.However, the movie itself looks and sounds good on DVD. If you have to own this (and God help you if you do), this is the best possible presentation you're going to get."
2,"""Music"" strikes the wrong chords","CAN'T STOP THE MUSIC is a film that was dated during its conception. The musical numbers are totally dumb, especially the silly ""Milkshake"" and the introduction number where Steve Guttenberg gleefully sings to an already-cliched disco beat while on roller skates. Bruce Jenner has the personality of cardboard and looks all wrong in the get-up consisting of cut-off jeans and a t-shirt exposing his belly button (ugh!). The nadar of this film is when Glen the leatherman sings ""Danny Boy"" during the audition. The stereotypes in this film are insulting from the laughable gym sequence in the YMCA production number to the ""flaming queen"" twirling the batons while wearing tight gold shorts."
2,But he sings so well.,"If you are gay, though, this is a great film. The YMCA episode is supurb! And the tenor of the group sings the best ""Danny Boy"" I have ever heard. Buy it just for that."
1,can't stop the music,I was dissappointed as this dvd was not compatable with Australian frequency and we could not view it on our DVD. It doesn't even come under 1 star as it could not be viewed
1,Bad Disco Camp-fest -So bad it's high camp!,"I'm only buying this because I'm in it(for about 3 frames)!This was Alan Carr's BOMB after the successof ""Grease"". Starring Steve Gutenberg, Valerie Perrine,Bruce Jenner, The Village People and The Ritchie Family.Overproduced on every level. Good Costumes. The ""Y.M.C.A.""production number is notable! (very GAY!)(So 70's)!"
5,Greatest Movie Ever Made!,"I loved this movie when it first came out! Its funny, its superb, its super! Though some parts are a little hard to swallow! The Village people can't act! Jenner could really perform under pressure, same with the easily swayable Guttenberg! Both did it so well that I ended up wondering about them! The village people looked hot with those swimmers in the Ymca number! I wished the local Ymca that I go to could be like that! A fabulously fun time for all (whether your like the Village people or not)! A good movie to watch without lights and all alone!"
1,Ew,"I played this game years ago and thought it was so cool, on a demo disc. I decided to waste $50.00 on this thinking it was obviously worth a lot of money for a reason. Was it? NO! The voices are extremely corny and the music is even more corny. But forget that, the game itself is corny.. You basically just throw barrells at other characters, what's so great about that?"
2,20th Century MASTERS?!?,The very idea of an artist as unconsequential as Donnie Iris gettting a 20th Century Masters release is hilarious! Who is next from the old MCA vaults? Point Blank? Law? KGB? This is ridiculous!
4,Greenhouse Operataions and Management 6th Ed.,"This is a very informative book on greenhouse structures, systems, and operations. It gives a detailed approach to opperating small and large scale greenhouse ranges. There are no color pictures, but other than that, it's a good buy."
4,So informative! Waiting for 7th Ed.,"This book pretty much teaches you everything you would ever want to know about indoor horticulture. The only drawback is that it was published in 2003, so some of the computer-related technical sections are probably a bit out of date. In any case, a great book for learning about greenhouse technology and other considerations for indoor growing."
1,What a complete waste...,"This cd now serves as a coaster in my house, and the liner notes long go were used as toiler paper. I am sorry, but this has to be one of the most untalented collectives I have ever heard, let alone seen live. I went to see the Hot Snakes, and it was all I could do not to fall over in boredom during the Cudas opening set. These guys were literally booed repeatedly. And instead of being graceful and disappearing, they played more poop. I am not sure what Speedo, I mean John Reis heard, but this aint rocket science. Bad is bad. Yuck!"
1,Fraud,"Like so many others, I got the dreaded H03 error. I consider it a complete outrage that Panasonic is not fixing this for free regardless of warranty status. They know this is an original defect. Selling these defective items is, IMHO, fraud. (I am no lawyer, but I believe that there is an implied warranty of reasonable service/peformance that does not depend on them promising 30/60/90 days or whatever. I wish some feisty, class-action oriented lawyer would buy one of these dogs!) Panasonic may think they are screwing us but they are screwing themselves. Consumers have both tongues and memories."
1,Boo!,"My husband purposely spent the extra money hoping to get a me a solid, long-lasting portable DVD player for Christmas. Unfortunately, mine lasted less than a year. I am a victim of the dreaded H03 error! I guess we should have done more research before buying."
1,Bad Product AND Service,"Mine lasted for about 18 months before H03 reared its head. Took it to my local customer 'service' center where it was examined by a man who apparently knew nothing about this error code, or indeed the player, at all. Best he could offer was some comment about 18 months being the average life for such a product. Outrageous! And, then waffled on about there being no power coming from the battery, which is clearly untrue before finishing up with some useful advice about buying a new one. It was at this point I picked up my 'dead' player and left. I'll be trying the tips on this page but if I do have to buy a new player it certainly won't be from Panasonic. Oh, and their wireless 'surround' headphones are useless as well!"
1,Adding another H03 victim to the list.,"We researched portable DVD players extensively when we bought this one (Nov. 2004) and we decided this one was worth the cost. We certainly believed it would last longer than it did. We just got hit with the H03 error as well, and in looking at the other previously written reviews, we see that Panasonic is not standing behind this product. Stating the obvious, Panasonic has lost our business. We're writing this review to add our one-star rating to the list."
1,HO3 fixable...,"This player has been great for us for about 14 months. Tonight we ran into the infamous H03, but had it up and running again after reading the trouble-shooting ideas below.The initialization trick (back skip/play/pause simultaneously) did not work, but taking the bottom off of the player and fiddling with the transport mechanism did the trick. For details, see ""Jedi""'s review below (approx. 40 reviews from the end). It is not a difficult exercise, so do not be intimidated by taking the screws out and getting your fingers in there. You will need a jeweler's philips-head screwdriver (the tiny, long ones).As many have said, the unit is sturdy, easy to operate, and has an attractive screen. Clearly, Panasonic is looking the other way on this one, or we'd have heard of a recall by now."
1,Mine's dead too,Bought this for my daughter last year for Christmas-2004. This week we got the H003 error. This cost way too much to die at 53 weeks.
2,Looked very interesting,I am writing the review I would have written had I read this book. Unfortunately I have a kindle and somehow save 3.93 cents over list price even though I can clearly see that the digital non-print book is charging the same as a new hardcover copy and 4 dollars more than the new paperback version.It is a shame that the publishers decided to go this route.The book looked good but I have chosen to explore other novels due to the publisher charging hardback prices for a book written in 1993.
1,Shoddy science and flat characters,"I was deeply disappointed with the science in this book. Clearly Nancy Kress hasn't bothered to do much research on sleep(its importance to long term memory) the immune system(the ravaging effects of sleep deprivation on health) or genetics (which she treats like big on and off switches).Because the book was so highly recommended to me I attempted to enjoy it in spite of theses flaws. But the characters were flat and didn't seem grounded in reality at all. Their conversations never sounded true or honest. Instead they seemed like tele-marketers reading scripts to one another. The whole book seemed to boil down to a hair care commercial touting,""Don't Hate Me Because I'm Beautiful"" as a central philosophy.Over all I would say that this book this was one of the most hateful reads I have ever endured."
1,Wonderful -- until she betrays it all in the end.,"I really enjoyed this book, right up until the end. Kress gives us a world full of great new ideas, very well thought out and believable. I often said to myself, ""She really understands!"" But the way she wraps up the story inspired me to swear to never read another word of her output as long as I live. Readers should be warned that if they really identify with the views seemingly expressed through the main body of the book, they will feel utterly betrayed by the ending."
1,What's the big fuss?,"This book is a mess from beginning to end. Why is everyone so excited about it? The main character does nothing of consequence for the entire book, which is amazing considering that, as one of the sleepless beings Kress has created, she lives without aging (?!?) for centuries. Kress doesn't know what she is writing about. There is nothing plausible in her science, her sociology, her characters, or, worst of all, her plot. The plotting comes from the ""One Damn Thing After Another"" school where things happen because the author needs a plot complication (see Jack Whyte for another example of this style). There is nothing organic at all about the characters, either in how they relate to each other or to the plot occuring around them. this is truly Shakespeare's ""tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing""."
4,...all you ever wanted,"Deserves 4.5 Unique sound, interesting lyrics...all you ever wanted. Music that sues the sawage beast anytime! I thought Hammerfall was the best, but this album really blew me away."
5,THE Power Metal Album,"If you like your music emotive, heavy and fast; yet technical, fantastic and original you should buy this album. Tired of hearing metal bands with classical leanings substitute instruments and choirs for synths? I was. Then I heard Rhapsody's ""Symphony..."" and realised people existed who agreed with me. Rhapsody don't cut corners with their music. The keyboard is used only to provide a unique sound; never to emulate another instrument. Listen to ""Emrald Sword"" and you will be blown away! I also recommend you check out Hammerfall's ""Legacy of Kings"". These two bands are really putting POWER back into METAL: where it belongs!"
5,corner pot rack,This was deliverered in a very timely manner and it is perfect for the small space I have and is heavy duty. Thanks
3,end of the game or end of his game?,"Amusing at times but mostly clunky and graceless, Beard pushes readers to imbibe his contradictory opinions and attitudes and his style can be quite suffocating."
2,Romantic paradise not for me,"After viewing Andre Live at the Royal Albert Hall and Live in Dublin DVDs (which I thoroughly enjoyed), I was bitterly disappointed with the Romantic Paradise DVD. Held live in the Italian city of Cortona, I found the camera focused too much on the audience, and the sound was not up to 5.1 standard. The microphones appeared to be set up in the audience and not near the orchestra as at the end of each tune, the clapping from the audience was deafening and the sound had to be turned down, also during audience participation, I found the clapping to drown out the orchestra. The 2 hour show was split into 2 parts and you had to go back into the menu to click on the 2nd part. Although Andres' singers have lovely voices, I would have preferred to have seen them singing on stage and not dancing around the fields (in video clips). Lets have a full concert!"
4,"Good, but not for everyone","The sounds (because I wouldn't call it music) can be meditative, but if you're already in an edgy mental mood this CD may rub you the wrong way. I still give it 4 stars, but with an asterisk."
5,PLATINUM!!!,"A stunning summary or consolidation of Albert Schweitzer's philosophical ethic, Reverence For Life.And a brilliant introduction to the man considered to be one of the greatest human beings of the 20th century.In its brevity the author manages to explain how Dr. Schweitzer articulated compassion and created a world view from it.BRILLIANT JOB!It should absolutely be required reading!"
3,A new album :),"I'm so glad to finally have the new Gorillaz album, been listening to it for the las couple of hours, finding some realy nice surprises.The studio version of the song Hong Kong is finally here, I prefer the live version, but this one has it's beauties, love the ending of this new versiom."
4,great new band,"These guys are from my home town of Charlotte NC. I have seen them play several times and thourghly enjoyed them, but this album beats all. They have risen to a new level with this CD. The songs are up beat and catchy, stuffed with hooks and melodies that wont leave your head. It is currently #1 in my personal CD rotation."
4,?????????????????,wow its way better that his old track he had a few good ones but praise u and others are so good i recomend it if u didbnt like the other cd u will lke this one
4,dancing in the streets,"I was not a Fatboy fan prior to buying this album and only bought such after the Chemical Brothers endorsed it during a magazine interview. If you desire something that will make you move your feet without listening to frantic fast-paced BPM tracks then buy this album. Also, the production and mixing are superb. While this is an ""old school"" album it is still contemporary and best of all, enjoyable. Fatboy is phat and far better than almost anything released by Def Jam."
5,The best techno CD ever!!!!,This is truly the best. I got it 2 weeks ago and still cant put it down. amazing CD!!
2,Bentley Rhythm Ace is better,"I remember when this guy did happy hardcore under the pseudonyms Freakpower, Mighty Dub Katz, etc. Now we're celebrating him as a genius.I like ""Praise You"" myself, but if you want the most badass Big Beat, go for Bentley Rhythm Ace or the Chemical Brothers. This slimmy's just a playa."
2,Overrated mess,"Other than a couple of killer tracks, this CD is pretty repetitious and boring when you really listen to it. 'Illin' in Heaven' is a total waste of disc space (the 'F' word repeated ad naseum - how deep), plus 'Praise You' sounds an awful lot like 'Unbelievable' by EMF. The Housemartins (Cook's band from the 80's) simply blow this mess away. No they weren't dance pop, but they had far more depth and variety than found on this limp CD."
4,Norman Cook(Fatboy Slim)is the greatest drum&bass guy around,"Fatboys new albulm is a lot more 60's ish and that is good. his last one was okay but some of the songs could make a person shriek for mercy. Oh well, it looks like he got it the second time around."
4,"beyond the pop appeal of ""praise""","I'm embarrassed to say I bought the CD because of that pop hit ""Praise You,"" especially after hearing the brilliance of the rest of the CD. Every piece on this is full circle, yin-yang, exists separately yet is part of the inner peace of the CD in its entirety. Is this CD a fluke or is this band all that?"
3,Hey DJ keep playin that song!,This is one of the few techno CD's that I truely dig. Not alot of repetitiveness and the music flows.
4,This was a great book.,"I think that this book was a good introduction to children starting to read the Sherlock Holmes mysteries. It showed how he thought, and was a good children's book."
5,Great for csection care,"A heating pad feels nice placed over the incision site. Also great for sore breasts and backs. I was always cold after the baby was born and used this to heat up the bed before getting in at night too. This pad is nice and soft, heats up quickly, and retains it for 15-20 minutes which seems just about perfect. I was so glad to have it."
4,convenient,"I recieved it two days ago. first, let me tell you that 30 minutes claim is not valid. I microwaved the pad for the time suggested and got around 10-12 minutes of therapeutic heat. The beads draws moisture from air, so i don't know effective it would be in dry season. I haven't, but it can also be used for cold therapy. This type of product is convenient (no mess). Overall quality of material look good and there is one year warranty."
3,Reasonable quality for the price,"Nice size and shape, but I wish it would stay hot longer. I find it has cooled off too much after only 10-12 minutes. Also, the cover is white, which starts to look dirty quickly.Still, it is reasonalby priced and doesn't take too long to heat up in the microwave. I also like that it is odorless, since I find the smell from scented heating pads too intense."
3,Just OK...,"I ordered a microwaveable heating pad because I live abroad and it's annoying to always have to deal with different outlets and voltages, etc with the electrical type. This thing definitely administers moist heat which is great, but it's pretty thick so you can't use it in bed while laying on it which is what I like to do for my upper back and neck. However, the fact that it is thick and heavy is sometimes nice if you're using it on your front for tummyaches, cramps, etc. It also doesn't stay hot very long which I guess is normal for something that isn't electric! I like it ok, but a thin electric heating pad is still the best in my opinion."
3,"Not recommended for newbies, but nice to have anyway...","This book isn't really for newcomers to the Visual Basic world, it covers many topics, but none in detail, and that's a real shame.... I was lucky to have some experience in VB before reading this, because sometimes everything isn't as clear as you'd want it to be.... And not everything I'd like to see covered is actually covered in the book... Nice to have as a reference though...."
2,not what I expected,"I slogged my way through this book; and there are some interesting facts in there about water and the environment. But this turned out to be the author's personal story--a kind of alternative, visionary self-help book. The following is a typical excerpt along those lines from this book:""One common method for healing the body with dew is to kneel in the nude and brush the open fingers and palms of one's hands across dew-laden vegetation.... Another method for touching the body with dew is to lie down naked on soft dewy grass and roll about. This is especially cosmic when done under one's celestial birth sign or when the light of the Moon is smiling or in full bloom.""If this is what you're seeking, this is your book. If you were hoping for a discussion of environmental issues, look elsewhere."
3,Fun Book with Moral Message,"This book was fine, but my children (two and four years old) have not asked to hear it again. I think that the message may be over their heads at this point. The illustrations were nice, but nothing exceptional."
1,Just a couple of questions...,"If this ""analysis"" is correct, and few elite indeed dominate the world, why would the powers that (supposedly) be allow Mr. Marrs to write about it? If ""they"" control the news do they not also control which books are published? Would they not at least eliminate the ""enlightened"" among us? Why are the books written by Marrs and his ilk allowed to sit on the shelves of our libraries?Or maybe this and similar works are actually written by The Establishment, but are full of false information to throw us off the track... Is ""Jim Marrs"" one of THEM?!?"
1,There's one born every second,"The easiest sell in the world is a boogie-man story. There is no more hidden history here than there is a moon made of cheese. You can find the same history told without the boogie-man angle in most libraries throughout the country. Again, don't waste your money."
1,I think Jim must live on Mars,"I love this type of book, however 90% of it is stolen from other conspiracy theory books and most of those theories have been flat out proven to be false. There was little to no actual investigation here. No new material, nothing to make my purchase worth while. First book in my life I threw in the trash where it belongs!"
4,"Concise, Linear, and truly scary!","Jim Marrs has done a wonderful job of researching the major secret societies and cabals from present day back into antiquity. I get very skeptical when reading the sections concerning the influence of Aliens on humankind. This aside, this book is very readable, and a lot of fun! Great Bibliography too!"
1,Absurd,"I give the single star only because there is not an option to give no stars at all. This book is lying nonsense pulled from a hat, put into book form and sold to gullible people. No one with more than a fifth grade education should be taken in by it."
3,Good,"Good souce for someone who is looking for starting a S-Corporation. However, this book will not provide any information if the corporation desires to have business other then your home state. Also, the CD that contains the forms are not named accuratly. Ther are numbered instead of having the form names. Some of the forms in the CD are missing. However, if someone is planning to open a business, this book will give to a vital information."
5,Off the hook,This CD is amazing. I heard their single on the radio listened to the whole record...I can listen to it all the way through! I cant wait to see whats next.
2,"Not the most stable mount, but it works","You can certainly find tv wall mounts that are better built than this one, but what can you really expect for one as cheap as this is? The tilting function is fine, just with a 27"" tube tv, you'll find yourself driving screws into the plate at the angle you want it so it won't tilt all by itself. Not a great feature on this wall mount because of how cheap the materials are. Other than that, my tv is still hanging on the wall and I advised my wife, if you're going to turn the tv on or off, please use the remote - let's not upset the fragile limb the tv hangs on."
3,Beware of Audiovox,"I purchased a FPE3000 Audiovox tv and the ac power is a box separate from the tv. The fans have gone bad and I have been trying for 6 months to order them or buy a new power box. A $2,000 TV THAT I CAN NOT WATCH.AUDIOVOX WILL NOT HELP YOU, THEY SEND YOU OFF ON THE WILD GOOSE CHASE OF YOUR LIFE. I HAVE FOLLOWED THEIR INSTRUCTIONS OF WHO TO CALL, LEFT EMAIL AND NEVER A RESPONSE. AUDIOVOX HAD ME CALL THE NUMBER OF PRIMA ELECTRONIC, I HAVE TRIED A HUNDRED TIMES (THEY COVER THE PARTS FOR AUDIOVOX)AND HAVE NEVER BEEN CONNECTED TO A PERSON. THEY PUT YOU ON HOLD AND THEN HANG UP ON YOU. AGAIN, BUYER BEWARE OF AUDIOVOX PRODUCTS"
5,A history of Spain during the reign of Franco,"This is my favourite book of all times. I have read it at least seven or eight times and every time, it never fails to excite me. The story is well told and animated and as well as understanding the life of El Cordobes, you also learn so much about the history of Spain, the era of Franco and the impact his tyranny had on the country. If you read this book, I guarantee you will not be disappointed."
2,Lots of Errors in this book!,"This is one of the worst books Prima has put out yet. It has good strategy sections, but when it comes to facts, this book is full of errors. The fish and insect charts are simply wrong in many cases, saying certain species aren't available in some months when they really are and vice versa. Prices of housing additions are wrong. Information about store hours is wrong. Finding info on a specific item is extremely difficult, since nothing is in alphabetical, no pictures are supplied, and the name of the items is in small print. The calendar of events is wrong, with erroneous dates and missing events etc. What's even worse, the Prima website does not have an errata posted that corrects all these problems. Go for the Nintendo Power guide. You'll be a lot happier. You can get it at Nintendo's website free with a subscription to Nintendo Power magazine."
1,Nintedo Guide is 10x better,"This guide is a waste of money compared to the Nintendo official guide. The Nintendo guide has pictures of everything: furniture, carpets, wallpaper, clothing, fossils, tools, fish, insects, stationary and more. It also is much better organized and has pictures of everything. The Prima guide is hard to read due to it's four colum per page format and the item guide is horrible. The only thing that saves this book are the charts of when to catch bugs and fish, although there are some wrong information and it does not tell where they can be found. Get the Nintendo book if you can, at Kamrt when you buy the game, you get the guide. The Nintendo guide is worth having."
4,Must have for Animal Crossing fans,If you play Animal Crossing a lot then you have to have this because there is so much to the game. There are some problems but it still is handy and can help a lot. That said you still will have to get some info on the internet. Is there such a thing as a casual AC player? I don't think so.
3,Love this Maxi Single,"112 truly did score big in clubs with their remixes to ""Dance With Me"" along with Beanie Siegel. I personally prefer the shorter version with Beanie Siegel, but this CD does justice in regards to journeying through all the versions; it's definitely not a waste."
1,Product was not properly manufactured.,Product not properly manufacured. Did not have holes drilled into supports arms so you could assemble it. I would avoid products from Duro medical.
1,zzzzzzz....,"Trust me when I tell you that this game is not worth a rental let alone a purchase. This game is definately the weakest of the RE series. This is obviously a last ditch effort to rake in a few more dollars with the Resident Evil name. This first person shooter game lacks any originality or creativity. It's the same thing over and over and over and over (well, you get the idea). The gameplay is sloppy and the animation is a joke. Your character is lame and slow and seemingly stupid. Don't bother wasting your time or money on this game. The reviews that you've read up to this point are correct...wake me up when it's over."
2,DOH!!!!!!!!! (SLAP),"Well what can I say. This game doesnt really suck, but isnt that good. The idea of a first person view was a good idea but this game lacked in several areas. The plot wasnt very good at all. It seemed as if the game was just thrown together to just put something on the market. I'm a huge fan of the resident evil series, but this game was a real dissapointment. My advice is to definatly rent the game first (it isnt very hard. I beat it in one day). If your a fan of the series then its definatly worth playing, but i wouldnt pay for it."
2,CAPCOM could have done aot better,"I feel this game was a total waste of time resident evil fans took the time to see what this game had to offer and we get something that was probably put together in the spur of the moment. If they would have put aot more time into it then, possibly, it would have been a good one to add to the list.but with the horrible graphics and short screenplay lets just say I was glad I rented it first before I purchased it myself. I mean the puzzles weren't even difficult you didn't even have to back track like in the other games. I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone due to the simpe fact that they put in no effort into this and simply let me as well as many other resident evil fans down."
1,This game is fun for about 15 minutes.,"This game starts out rather interesting, if you can from the start ignore the fact that the US has prevented the use of the light gun. (I understand this is because of the recent school shootings. However, without this function the game looses it's apeal rather quickly.)This game has little varition between each senario. Other than two option choices at the very beginning the game is exactly the same through out. It rapidly looses it's challenge and gets completely boring after the you start the second senario.If you are trying to improve your first person shooter skills, rent this game, but I would not recommend purchasing it."
4,A Solid Textbook,"I really enjoyed this logic textbook. It's biggest benifit is its coverage of belief logic, deontic logic, modal logic, and so on... It is amazing how much is in this book. The Logicola software that comes with this book is pretty good as well, however it is very primative looking.Now here is the catch: I liked the book because it used interesting philosophical examples for its logic problems, however my introductory level students often found themselves lost in the philosophy-speak and unable to do the logic. The book might be best for an introductory text for philosophy majors."
1,The Crushed Flowers,"My God, my God, alas, alas, doth Thou look down with pityThe Flowers of Charles Baudelaire are written as a ditty.There is nothing here that could conspire to elevate the mindThe nobility of verse has gone - a sacrifice to rhyme.An injustice to the Muse, an injustice to the SpiritOf the esteemed Charles Baudelaire, of France's greatest poet.Alas, alas, my God, my God, doth Thou look down with pity."

1,Lame,"Saw this when it came out years ago; this DVD is an 'R' rated copy of an NC-17 movie... at at least three different points, this version deletes some very erotic material from the original. Now, this could be on regular broadcast TV. Save your money, especially if you're thinking of buying it because you think you KNOW what's supposed to be there. It ain't."
2,Not Great Quality,This necklace (which I bought as a gift) started to discolor within the first couple weeks of regular use. The silver started to flake off and show a pinkish material underneath. The whole thing was thrown away within six months.
5,Wonderful!,"Insightful, enlightening and well presented. Although there is some redundant information between the sets, it is all good!"
2,"Limitted vocabulary, too thick","Although quite small, but it is too thick, almost 2 inches. So it doesn't fit well or comfortably in pockets. Whereas the webster new world pocket spanish dictionary is larger, but it is thinner, and fit more comfortably in shirt or pant pocket.Power wise, there are more words in the webster pocket, than this one. Both were grossly insufficient for reading of newspaper or of most books. They would be fine for beginner student use, and adequate for occasional use, but they are frustrating to use if you are trying to read the paper or book.A cheap small electronic translator by Franklin is much more efficient and TOTALLY powerful for reading 99% of words in most books. They have ""five million"" words (which includes all conjugated forms of most verbs) - and is the ideal tool for reading all books. Unfortunately, Franklin does not make their Larousse versions, which will cover most slangs.If you need a pocket dictionary, don't pick this one."
3,Fairly weak magnets,"The magnets are fairly weak. I purchased these to hold potholders on my fridge, and they have trouble supporting the weight of 1 dollar store pot holder/mitt."
5,The continuing legend of the letter 2 and the numeral U,"The ultimate underdogs of this plastic culture have done it again! Negativland naturally draws out lawyers like s--- draws flies, so if you are a fan, you better get this album before it once again rains lawsuits! Not only do they re-release the two legendary ""banned"" tracks that started the whole sordid legal hassle, they also include many ""live"" versions, complete with all the ""Weatherman's"" wheezings, obscure phraises about his cat, formula 409, doorbell transformers, and his very nasal lampooning of the band U2's juvenile lyrics!Warning: Do not listen to on headphones and fall asleep while doing so, you will be rudely awaken after the end song. Nine minutes after that ""sanitized"" song ""ends,"" the silence is broken by a collage of Casey Kasem's potty mouth spewing a plethora of foul words!"
5,Smooth like milk chocolate,One of the best cds to come out in the R&B genre for a single male artist. Charlie Wilson is great in every song on this cd. He is even better in concert. His voice is raspy but very clear and at the same time touches your soul and makes you get up and shake your shoulders and dance with the honeys. Mmmmmm good. Hats off to Cha-lee
3,Large and small Savannah bird girl,"I ordered both items. I did read the product descriptions and dimensions however I was disappointed that the large one was so small. I just did not realize how small it would be!! I thought it would be large enough to use in my garden as a child size statue. Both are beautiful but for the price I was disappointed in the size. The statues are the prettiest one I have seen and if they were just larger, I would be thrilled. Measure carefully and consider the price. The quality is fine."
2,Only For Diehard Fans,"Only diehard fans will be able to listen to this 6-track EP which presents the original version of ""Beautiful Life"" followed by the 12-inch extended version and then four other lame remixes masquerading as club mixes. This EP was originally released in Denmark during 1995 and later in the USA by Arista Records.Perhaps during 1994 - 1995, the mixes were hot stuff but now they are boring and absolutely excruciating by the fourth version, because the only change is a minor adjustment to the speed of the drum machine. If you want to coerce a confession from somebody then this would be a good weapon to use. I wonder if the CIA used this at Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq? But if you are a fanatical Ace of Bass fan, you will probably love this. I don't and if I have to listen to it again, I will confess to crimes I never committed."
1,Wouldn't recommend to any vegetarian!,"I don't really think I could recommend a vegetarian cookbook that has chicken broth in one recipe (pg. 35) and bacon in another recipe (pg. 98). Plus most of the other recipes rely on cheese, butter and milk for protein and flavor. The one good thing about it is that the ingredients are common, not many expensive or exotic. Might be good for lacto-ovo vegetarians who really love cheese but otherwise...pretty lame."
1,Not good,"The dictionary has very small amount of words - less then 40,000 for each language - in opposite what was declared by seller; also we had very hard time with seller returning this product despite we observed return policy."
3,Worth It,"I was cautious about this purchase after reading the reviews of others. After using the Coby MP-C7082 MP3 Player for a week or so, I have to say, they were right. This little thing can be infuriating until you get used to the navigation. Even then it's awkward to use and just an all around pain in the butt.That being said, it works. It stores music and video, then plays it back. I got it on a gold box deal for really cheap and I think it was worth the price."
2,I can't upload music for the PC,"Only can play the radio, the computer don't recognize this device and I am not allowed to put music to it"
1,horrible mp3!,"how can players this bad still be sold nowadays? this thing is horrible....very cheaply made and came with huge earbuds....and mine hardly would keep a charge even after charging for hours....also the interface is very NON user friendly(not for the average users)it is a very poorly made/designed mp3 player....i bought it for $8.50w/ free shipping....not even that cheap is it worth the trouble for amazon to ship it 2 me for free with 2day prime....DO NOT BUY, THIS MP3 PLAYER SHOULD BE SOLD @ THE DOLLAR STORE!"
1,do not buy!!!!!,"I was interested in this item, because it sounded to be true. Well as you always hear if it sounds too good to be true it probably is. I bought this item because I could not believe it was good for the claims. After a couple of weeks, it would not turn on and has no reset button. If you go on the website the product is no longer listed. Need I say more DO NOT BUY THIS PIECE OF xxxx"
2,not a very good MP3 player,"This mp3 player is hard to use and very slow when it comes to getting into your music. Also when u want to download your music, the mp3 player wont download all the music u have on your sinc list. The battery doesn't last very long either. I only paid $13.00 for it but if u want the 2 gb it costs over 40 dollars and would not be worth that amount. It also says in the booklet that comes with the package that u can update the software, but when i went to the website the booklet told me to, the update was not there."
2,"Boring, but interesting photography","This is an incredibly boring film, with lots of meaningless talk and talk. However, there are nice outdoor shots of Frankfurt in 1948, with all the post-war rubble all around. There were other films with scenes of Germany during this post-war period. One that comes to mind is Billy Wilder's ""A Foreign Affair""; which is more interesting than this bland film, even though it is not one of Wilder's best. Another great film of this type is ""The Third Man"", but that has scenes of Vienna, not Germany."
2,Not as good as the album version,"Why did 666 make a new radio version, when the album version was sooo much better? The start of the song is hugely annoying with the do-do-do-paradox chant wearing a little to thin after a while, and all of the catchiness of the album version is gone as one of the best synth lines I've ever heard is not on the track.I guess they tried to make up for it with the inclusion of the CD ROM component, which did cheer me up a bit, but alas the mixes are all strikingly familiar to each other which only adds salt to the wound. Do yourself a favour and spend a little extra for the album which DOES contain quality songs."
3,A good set for the money.,"A good set for the money, but if you're looking for a portable tv to play game consoles on, this probably isn't the one. Primarily because of the absence of A/V jacks. You will have to invest in a RF adapter and your expensive game console will lose some audio and video strength through the signal translation."
1,Terrible and misleading.,The menu screen keeps shaking. The picture quality is terrible with even cable. The hookup connector is very hard to reach. You can figure out that this one is a cheap one at a glance. I'm returning this 30 minutes after receiving it.
3,College acceptable,This product is good to keep the college dorm rooms looking nice. It is not too small and it not too big and bulky. It's just an appropiate size. The only negative thing about this item is that it does not have in any audio/visual outputs and inputs it just contains your typical cable/antenna connector.
4,Worth It,A boon for the Crowded House/ Neil Finn fan. You would pay at least $30 in import singles for the second CD alone
5,German Mythology,Excellent translation of the German Epic of Siegfried's death and Kriemhild's revenge. Used as material for Wagner's third opera in the Ring Cycle. Very important material for anyone interested in the Geramn cultural tradition.
2,One more book to donate to the library...,"The preface starts off indicating the original idea for this book: as a campaign book and biography. So put on those rose-colored glasses and read about Jimmy in third-person. I don't like the posturing, this book reads like it was written to impress rather than give the reader a glimpse of who Jimmy is. Seems to me the author was too close to the president to offer an objective viewpoint. His early life is glossed over and it's just the 'character building' traits which are revealed. I thought Colin Powell's ""My American Journey"" and Anderson's ""Che"" did a much better job of revealing the person, and telling the story.An odd part of this book was the long family history in the beginning. Maybe this was one facet Jimmy inserted, but it just went off on a long tangent."
2,"Good concept, doesn't stay put.","This has two clips at 90 degrees to each other. One goes on the little loop on the back of the tie, to other goes on your shirt. The part that goes on my shirt always falls off, so this hasn't really worked out for me."
4,Battery life in the S2,"I've had an S2 for three years or so (just replaced it with an S3), and I've found that the battery life is VERY dependent upon use of the rear-panel color LCD display.I spent three weeks in the UK in 2004 with the S2 and no charger, so I made a major effort not to play with the color display. I went nearly all three weeks and took 1800 pictures on three sets of NiMH batteries (I finally put a set of alkalines in two days before the end of the trip).The Lithium cell life depends mostly on flash usage. I usually got four to six months on a set. If one dies in the field, you can use the camera without them. Only the flash doesn't work."
1,American Experience: The Great Famine,"Title misrepresents content.This famine was triggered by Lenin's NEP (New Economic Program).This famine was caused by Soviet indifference to human life.The ""Great Famine"" was the one in 1932-33 where many times the 1921 number were intentionally starved to deathThat famine was used as an instrument to eliminate a class of people the Soviets found troublesome, to steal their lands and property,and to repopulate those lands with more compliant settlers from Russia and Bilorus."
4,Best JFK theory book I have ever read.,"This book describes how America, the U. S. Government, and Lee Harvey Oswald all arrived at the events of 22 November 1963. After reading this book, those events, especially those events concerning Oswald, began to me to look unavoidable.I have read dozens of books on this subject, and this book provides one of the most articulate theories I have come across. It disposes of theories used by other writers and systematically builds up to the writer's theory. The author also doesn't spend page after page disecting the medical evidence or film study (while I have read books on this subject dealing with mostly these topics, they all seem to be repetive and boring after many hours of reading). He does adress these topics, but reduces the information to readable quantities.This book is an easy read. If you forget something about the author's theory, he references the past chapters for you to be able to reread.I was not able to put this book down until I finished it."
2,A little too cheesy for the parents,"We've enjoyed two other more upbeat children's albums by this artist, but I'd have to agree with another reviewer that this was too syrupy-sweet for us to endure."
2,Soothing sounds and voice but annoyed me,"Purchased at recommendation of a parenting magazine and the 2 reviews on line. I can see how the music and the singer's voice would be soothing for a baby, but frankly, her voice annoyed me. Was a little too syrupy and sing-songy for me. I'd fall asleep easier to some old Enya or just instrumental versions of this, I think. Just my personal opinion."
2,What Happened?,"I wish I'd first read the other reviews here. I though a Version 4 should include and improve on the features of version 3. It seems half the things in version 3 that I really liked, have been removed (such as being able to indivdualy zoom objects), and in return what do we get, multiple views and a few more stars... Well at least I now have a full collection of all 4 versions of redshift.."
4,Featured on 'The Hitch-Hikers Guide to the Galaxy',"Yes, this perfect wallpaper music also features as background noises when 'the book' speaks in the Hitch-Hikers guide to the galaxy."
1,Not as enthralled as the others,I really did not enjoy this book. I thought it a bit of a ramble. The POW section was interesting but I just didn't find that about the rest of the book.Really don't waste your money on this one. I don't know what the others have read.
2,Disappointing,"Uses continuity, yet doesn't use continuity, ends up a mess. Some bits will only be of interest to Who fans - the origin of the Sontarans and the retinal scanner trick were very good, but much of the rest will annoy many people - the doctor and Omega relationship was just a rehash of the Three Doctors and Arc, but because its 'a different universe' there was no reference to those stories. In the end I didn't care about the Doctor or any of the other characters"
1,Not The best,"This Arm guard doesn't really protect your arm. It is basically a sock with no protection and the threads start unraveling soon after purchase. Unless you run a really cheap archery camp, this isn't worth wasting your money on."
1,low qualiyy,These arm guards aren't worth the money. They work only if you keep them stretched extremely tight. The threads started to unravel after the second use. There are many better products on the market.
2,"Dull, plodding, boring",Maybe you have to be Irish to appreciate the Irish wit. I shut this down about halfway through because it just wasn't very entertaining and I was having a hard time following the confused story line.
2,"Jimmy, say it ain't so!","I have loved Cagney for years, and would have prefered not to know all the bubble bursting details brought out in this story. His early years, telling of his family of origin and bowery boy childhood was fascinating. I should have stopped reading there. When he marries the strong willed Billie early on, he is not the powerhouse man of his movies. She becomes an obstacle between his family and their adoptive children. If this is not disappointing enough, you will also plow through excessive analysis of every character Cagney ever played. I've seen most of those movies, haven't you? Having to imply deeper content to pure entertainment is a bore. If you love the magic of Cagney's film charisma, skip this read. Your Jimmy will be gone."
1,Replaced,"After about year I could only get about 40 minutes run time out of the flashlight. It died when I needed it most!I felt as though it was always switching to charge mode to bring the battery up to capacity. Took forever to charge in the car, so I'd bring it in and charge it through the AC if I drained it down completely. Replaced with a streamlight product."
2,A HEAVY MONSTER WITH LITTLE PERFORMANCE,"I was looking to purchase an outdoor Rechargeable and powerful Flashlight/ spotlight. Although the casing looks to be durable the main function which is a bright and concentrated light beam is missing,why would you want to carry a heavy few ponder if you could get the same performance from a simple flashlight. very disappointing."
1,"If you can't breastfeed, you are doomed","I read this book before it had the LLL tag added, I guess it is now obvious that this is for breastfeeding mothers. I bought and read this book when my first child was 4 weeks old and still feel guilty 3 years later. I fully intended to breastfeed my son but couldn't. If you are unable to (or choose not to) breastfeed, don't even touch this book. Sears made me feel like I would never ever be a good parent because I wasn't able to breastfeed my baby. I also don't see how his suggestions work if you have more than one child and need to get your sleep at night. I hope that others can be spared the pain of being chastised for not breastfeeding -- especially when not being able to breastfeed was painful enough on its own. Thank goodness they added the part about LLL so that people like me would know not to buy this book."
1,I was put off from the start,"I purchased this book and several others because I wanted to decide on parenting style: demand feeding vs. scheduling, sleeping habits, etc. This book didn't make any sense to me at all. I think its methods will produce needy, clingy, whiny, dependent children. I have asked mothers of more than one child and they all said that they tried the methods this book advocated for the first child, failed miserably, then succeeded with a more structured approach with baby number 2."
3,Not for parents of older infants,"This book strongly pushes the ""family bed"" technique of child rearing. If you're interested in that, this book is for you. If, however, you have an older infant who has suddenly decided she doesn't want to sleep, you're not going to get a lot of help from this book. There are a few suggestions and comments that might help you, but the book is really written for the new parent - to start your baby sleeping in your bed from the very beginning. Very well written with an obvious abundance of knowledge about babies, but not the book for everyone; and not the answer to questions about a baby sleeping in her own bed."
2,Not solutions for moms who work outside the home...,"I have a ""high need"" baby, according to Dr. Sears. Many of the suggestions in this book (nap when your baby naps) are not suited to women who work outside the home. My baby is 4 months old and I have tried front carriers, and slings; I breastfeed my baby; I sing to him; we have every kind of rocking chair, bouncy chair, and swing; we co-sleep. I quickly respond to my child's crying. None of these things stop the 1-2 hours of livid screaming per night. This book made me feel guilty for failing to figure out how stop the screaming."
4,Perfect for Beginners,"That's just it--these are great to begin learning with. They don't last long, though, and young children should be taught right away how to be careful with them (to avoid cracking, splitting)."
3,Works.,"Yep. They work. I never tried other REEDs, but it seems to work just fine. Good stuff. Sometimes I get chipped Reeds, but that's expected. Cheaper to buy here than a local music shop."
3,Works ok,"I got these for my son who was taking clarinet for JR High band. They seem to break/split fairly easily, then i guess maybe they all do. He went through about half a box this school year so its not too expensive. It's much cheaper that paying $2.00 each(what the school charges the kids) so hopefully he will have enough for next year too."
4,Good Starter Reeds - Great Value,"I have always found Ricos to be acceptable beginner reeds for students in their first year or two playing. The reeds are fairly consistent, and the lower price means that breaking a reed is not too much of an expense for whomever is footing the bill for reeds (teacher, student, school, parent...). The provided plastic cases do a good job protecting the reed, as long as they are not pushed in too far. I am glad to see Amazon carries such a good variety of sizes and quantities.As a teacher, I usually try to stock up and save some money by getting the 25 count boxes. Prices are easily competitive with many internet music retailers - but with prime (or super saver) shipping through Amazon!!"
5,Superbly played Brahms,"There are other very fine performances of Brahms' wonderful String Sextets, but none, I feel, as totally satisfying as these by the Raphael Ensemble. They combine a sense of rich, enveloping warmth with dynamic, detailed expression. There is nothing rushed or superficial here. The music often flows with a sense of ease and flexibility, all the while conveying some of the most poignant songfulness and beautifully shaded colors and tones. There also is playing of considerable nobility, which occasionally brings tears to my eyes. This Hyperion special edition, remastered version (noted in the representation above) provides a more centered, tonally balanced sound than the original pressing. However, the original pressing, with the same pastoral scene on its front cover, is still very satisfying. You can easily locate it here on Amazon, and read what others have had to say about these performances. They seem to epitomize Brahms at his best."
4,Very Good,"Through the eyes of a man who goes from sanity to insanity, how experiences can change us all!"
1,Could not finish it,"I was interested because the book got some praise for its use of language, and I like anything with inventive, well-crafted prose. The beginning was interesting, but eventually I realized that the plot device used to introduce the story was not going to come back. All that was left was a seemingly endless tale of derring-do in a late-middle-english-sounding style that was confusing and not very compelling in and of itself. Maybe there are some people in the world who would like this book, but I couldn't stand it."
1,I have to agree with the other poor reviews.,"Generally speaking I love Clapton, so I hate to admit it but this is just a plain ole lackluster performance. Don't bother."
2,"Mostly you, and a little of Mr. Johnson","My disdain starts with the cover photo. Give it a look. If you're a Robert Johnson fan, you'll see what I mean. This is more commercialized schlock from Eric Clapton. Another in a long line of attempts at currying favor with blues listeners. It's obvious that Eric has something else on his mind. I think it's time he got down to whatever it is, rather than take the easy way out in order to pump out another album. In short, this album has very little of Robert Johnson, and a whole lot of 'formula' music, designed to keep the public appeased. I see absolutely no reason to have released this album when Robert Johnson's collected works can be heard as they were intended."
1,Blues is a Feeling ?,"This latest effort by the aging Birtish rock icon; once called God, is the epitome of the Brits yet again ripping off the great American bluesmen. This is somehow more eggregious, as it is a direct lift from perhaps the greatest blues player of all time. Clapton has no shame. The singing is horrid. If there is anything that the blues community agrees on is that Robert Johnson was the seminal figure in Mississippi Delta blues. Sure Clapton has the chops on the axe. But is nowhere near Buddy Guy, Albert King, B. B. King, Freddie King, Jimmy Reed and great Muddy Waters. NO. Not even close. Don't buy this !"
2,"I love both Clapton and Johnson, but ...","This album is very disappointing. Clapton could have done Johnson pure. Robert Johnson himself was one man with a guitar; I'd hoped for that with this album, Clapton channelling Johnson, if you will. What we get instead is a very muddily produced ensemble, little of the Clapton magic, and the worst version of Come On In My Kitchen I've heard in a long while. I hate that I don't like this: it combines Clapton with Johnson, two of the best blues artists of all time. But, frankly, it's mostly bad. I gave it 2* just because it's Clapton playing the blues, and how bad can that be? But get Robert Johnson: The Complete Recordings if you want to hear this as it should be heard."
1,Nothing Fresh about this!,"Eric should have listened to Peter Green's ""Hotfoot Powder"" and ""Robert Johnsons Songbook"". Peter sheds a fresh light on well known, often covered and certainly revered material. Eric sounds uninspired. I wish he could have just been happy that someone in the blues community had honored Mr. Johnson and put new life in his wonderful songs without thinking it had to be himself. Eric certainly has a marvelous catalog to his credit, this isn't among the marvelous."
5,Essential Listening,"This is a spectacular demonstration of what the blues is all about. I really believe this CD along with other recent releases by Aerosmith ""Honkin On Bobo"", and ""Hittin' the Note"" by the Allman Brothers could spark a new blues revival."
1,BAD RECORD,"When I heard this I couldn't believe my ears : YIKES!!!!This is really BAD BAD music, very BAD and UNINSPIRED.It is just a bunch of UGLY DUMB sounds and the guitarrists can't even play and the drummer sounds like Terry from my class who had ADHD and the girl who sings sounds like she has to go potty all the time.I like music but this is oreful!"
3,More Clapton than Johnson,"This is pretty good. Most of Clapton's stuff is. Sadly, I guess, he made a few great recordings, blazing with passion and fire. The rest of his work will always be compared unfavorably to those. Most of what he's done is tasteful and professional. A good indicator for the potential buyer would be Clapton's last ""blues"" album ""From the Cradle."" You'll like this, I predict, about as much as you liked that."
2,no applause for CLAPton,"ok, lets get started. EC is guitar virtuoso!--the problem for many of his releases are they are just boring-he seems to just go through the motions with his personal interperetations of his mentors blues songs. this release is just another in a long standing tradition of his blues GIVING US the blues for listening. If I were to be EC's manager and producer for this record---I would have had EC alone in the studio with no hired help professionals with his acoustic guitar tapping his toes-it also would have been great to have his cd look and sound like it was vinyl(with pops and squeeks)-making it a more pure homage to his great mentor. EC outlook is positive these daze, but it would have been helpful for him to look waydowndeepinside of himself of his melancholy past(which I am sure RJ did in his day to day life and his enviroment). good try EC but you should have listened to my advice. jh"
2,"Mildly Tepid, Yet Bland","Eric Clapton has been introducing the ""Blues"" to new audiences for almost his entire life. Early in his career, he could take an obsure blues song like ""Crossroads"" and make it into a rock hit. A number of Robert Johnson's songs were recorded in the corner of a hotel room on ancient equipment. These harsh sounding, yet powerful performances can send chills up your spine. Sadly, ""Me and Mr. Johnson"" is just plain boring to listen to. The song arrangements stay mostly faithful to the original recordings, but there are too many instruments on them. The band contains some fine musicians, but they sound so polished and lifeless. Clapton's playing is competent as usual, but it lacks the enthusiam that used to set him apart from all his peers."
3,Great Concept - Poor Execution,"The power of Robert Johnson's music lies in his haunting lyrics, stark arrangements, and tortured delivery. Unfortunately, in reworking Johnson's songs for ""Me and Mr Johnson"", Eric Clapton has robbed them of their original power, substituting instead competent, but out-of-place, Chicago Blues-style arrangements and disappointingly hackneyed vocal delivery. Johnson's lyrics alone are left to carry the load and, alas, they cannot.Clapton can do better, and, indeed, he has. Listen to ""Malted Milk"" fromUnpluggedand ""Terraplane Blues"" and ""Ramblin' on My Mind"" fromSessions For Robert J. (CD + DVD)for proof that he can interpret Johnson's music in inspired fashion. Given the magnitude of Robert Johnson's influence on Eric Clapton, a Clapton album comprised entirely of Johnson's songs seemed a very promising undertaking. If only ""Me and Mr Johnson"" had lived up to that promise . . ."
1,He had good intentions but...,"I'm not sure what Eric Clapton was thinking when he released this ""tribute"" album. The feel, the soul, the raw passion of Robert Johnson is nowhere to be found. Do yourself a favor and just go buy the original Robert Johnson recordings."
3,Expected more based on album title !,"Don't expect listen another ""From the Cradle"" because this album are very distant of this new ""Me & Mr Johnson""!Something missing but I don't know what...intensity, feeling, carism, innovation...in some moments the songs stop in the time and a sensation of ""empty"" stay on the air.Whatever this album show some good moments (slow moments but good!). All musicians are playing with dedication and accuracy, inclusively Clapton that play like always (and like nobody) your registered style. Perfect for listen in a ""raining sunday"" with a fragille wind cover your face in the window! :)"
4,Good not great,"Me & Mr Johnson by Eric Clapton is rocking good!Not his best effort, but awesome nonetheless."
1,Out the window at 70 mph.....,"I played it 1-1/2 times...then it became litter.The cover showing Clapton in a stark setting, acoustic guitar in hand, led me to believe this would be an "" solo acoustic blues"" album, befitting a ""tribute"" to RJ.WRONG.Slick, over produced, over-blown, and most especially, over-instrumented, this disc sounds like a ""Chicago Blues"" session...Yes, I disliked this take on Robert Johnson very much.To Eric Clapton:Listen to Rory Block doing Johnson....The Lady and Mr. JohnsonThat's how to show tribute...Smokin'!!"
1,About as much fun as the bubonic plague,"Eric, Eric, Eric - what WERE you thinking? This album is like paying to be in a plane crash; Thomas Eddison is no doubt turning in his grave!!! The albums one and only saving grace is that those who have heard it, through bitter personal experience can honestly claim to know what the blues is all about - unlike Mr Clapton, who evidently HAS no soul, and is therefore completely unable to produce passionate music. I've experienced greater levels of emotional resonance in the lift going up to the car park!Somewhere up in heaven, Son House, Henry Thomas, Charley Patton, Fred Mcdowell, Blind Lemon and Leadbelly etc are no doubt already sharpening their knives!"
4,Bubba Sparxxx it up,"Bubba Sparxxx it up rep'in the south. Everything on this album is tight (Timberland also did his thing), but I had to give him four stars for not having atleast one calabo. It would've been good to here him trading rhymes wit a hip-hop heavyweight. Besides that everything is on point. If you like dat southern flow pick up this album."
2,Dont waste your money,"I was a big fan of Bubba when he first came out with ""Ugly""... anyway the first 5 tracks or make that 4 are the best... the rest is trash... it gets annoying and repetitive... what made me really buy it is the fact that it was ""produced by Timbaland"" but the second half of the album wasnt... just buy the single and move on..."
3,Potential,"Most of the time when I give out a three, I go out and criticize albums. But in this case, there was a lot of ups to this album. Bubba's flow was pretty much good. The beats on the album were tight. I only had one problem which made me give it a three. Some of the beats Bubba rapped too, he didnt do it right. Some of those Twista like beats Bubba just couldn't do it. Those are my favorite kind of beats. And Bubba couldn't flow to it. Damn. Another thing, is that he talks about Betty too much. It gets freakin annoyin after a while. However out of the whole CD, the only song I could really listen to was Regardless wit him and C.I. that was the hottest track on the album. C.I. came in and completely killed it. He definitely out-shined Bubba there. They need to get together and do something cause they make a pretty good duo.Overall: For a southern rapper. A white, southern rapper for that matter, Bubba did exceptionally well. By next album, he will be near flawless."
1,worst album ever,lets see here......3 things to describe bubba1. worst rapper since mase2. obsessed with athens (what is it?)3. thinks he's a ruff ryderlets just say if he got a record deal i should be able to in a second cuz this guy just plain suxhe makes a guest appearence in ruff ryders volume 3 with jadakiss.....thats a great song.....or it would be if bubba wasnt in it cuz he just messes it up with his low class rhymes
3,works unless leaky,"I really like this hot water bottle because it has two sides which read different temperatures. The cloth side feels less aggressively hot. But, it can leak."
2,GET THE DUNK SEAT INSTEAD!,"The idea for this product was great, unfortunately the product itself was a real disappointment. First of all, there is only a small reservoir (about 2 oz.) that you fill with water. You have to keep the helmet steady or the water will spill out before you even start to pull the sticks out. When you do get the right stick, the water only trickles out (that's if there is any water left in it). We bought the Dunk Seat at the same time, and it is a much better product."
4,Scrooged,"I think this is one of the ""must see"" holiday films. I love Bill Murray as TV exec Frank Cross. A funny twist of a Dickens classic. The ending is a bit corny,(hence only 4 stars), but you'll still walk away from this one smiling. Put a little love in your heart and watch this dvd."
5,Comedy for the whole family,"This is our favorite Christmas movie - a must see every holiday. Bill Murray at his best - really great version of ""The Christmas Carol"" without being too ""sappy""."
4,We like Scrooged so much we decide to 'Scrooged' our whole family.,Great off beat version of an old classic that only Bill Murray can carry off. If you like his type of humor you will enjoy this movie
4,Murray,"If I was going to write a movie that had been done to death, I would have picked Bill to be the main charactor in it because it will win hearts"
4,Scrooged,"Frank Cross runs a US TV station which is planning a live adaptation of Dickens' Christmas Carol. Frank's childhood wasn't a particularly pleasant one, and so he doesn't really appreciate the Christmas spirit. With the help of the ghosts of Christmas past, present and future, Frank realizes he must change. Has a bunch of old and new stars for the time it was made, ie: Bill Murray, Karen Allen, John Forsythe, John Glover, Bobcat Goldthwait, David Johansen, Carol Kane, Robert Mitchum, Nicholas Phillips, Michael J. Pollard, Alfre Woodard, Mabel King, John Murray, Jamie Farr, Robert Goulet, Buddy Hackett, Lee Majors, Mary Lou Retton, are just a few. Funny movie well worth the watch."
4,Great alternative for Christmas,We liked this movie since it takes the usual Christmas Carol story & gives it a current (80's) twist to it. Good to add to the collection of serious & comic for the season.
4,Ok,"My favorite parts is a little clip that his secretary says and that ""look"" Bill Murray puts on his face in his movies. The movie is ok. If you like Bill Murray, which I do, you'll like it."
4,Scrooged,We love this movie. Bill Murray and the rest of the cast is awesome in this. A lot of adult humor but not tacky - this is a great take off on the classic Scrooge.
5,My Favorite Christmas Movie,"This is the only movie I'm sure to watch every Christmas. One of the best variations of Scrooge ever. Only thing is one warning for parents, there's one scene where he screams ""GD"" over and over....kind of ruins an otherwise good family movie."
3,TWO WORDS TO WATCH THIS FILM: BILL MURRAY.,"Bill Murray is a great actor. He can play funny guys, nasty guys, wacky guys, lovable guys, etc. In ""Scrooged"" he plays all those guys in only one character (Frank Cross).""Scrooged"" is a movie set in Christmas, so the best time to enjoy it is definitely in december. Perhaps if the role of Frank Cross, the modern Scrooge, would have been portrayed by other actor, the movie wouldn't have been so entertaining, and that is the sign of a good actor. Every actor that can make better a movie with his/her performance deserves to be called a great actor. I call Bill Murray A GREAT ACTOR."
5,Movies,No problems here. It shipped fast and came in one piece. I was espcecially surprsed how fastare since it wasto so closeyou to xmas. I would use this person again.
4,Repent! Avoid the Rush.,"I never tire of watching Scrooged. I have seen it before the holidays and the 4th of July. It never fails to make me laugh and I always get the tears and the lump (yes you, Lumpy) in my throat.It is Bill Murray at his best and the cameos are priceless. Look for Kathy Kinney from the Drew Carey Show in an early role. Bobcat Goldthwaite in the lesser but no less essential role of Elliott Loudermilk (Bob Cratchet).One of Anne Ramsey's last screen appearances. God I love this movie!If this film doesn't move you then maybe YOU need a little visitation. Have your ghost call my ghost and I'll see when I can fit you in."
5,Excellent commentary on the Aeneid,"The structure of the book has been well thought out,with short sections of the text above the vocabulary for that text and at the bottom there is a full commentary with grammatical explanations. There are full explanations of the progress of the story, with interludes explaining the action to come and explanations of both gods and humans. Altogether, I would recommend this book to any sixth form or university classics student."
3,It's Okay,"The chopping blade of my Cuisinart chopper developed stress fractures, which collected debris that could not be washed or soaked or scrubbed out. I purchased this replacement blade because the photo shows metal blades that go completely around the shaft instead of metal tips that attach to the plastic housing. The replacement I received does NOT have metal going around the shaft, so I expect the same cracks to reappear over time. Once that happens, I think I'll just toss the chopper and invest in a better quality piece of equipment."
4,pretty good,"i just recently bought this cd and i think it's pretty good, it has some solid songs like trak 3 is nice and ghetto hell yeah"
1,STOP yelling over the tracks!!,"Seriously, when I think of kay slay, all I can think of is this idiot yelling over tracks.Hello...I didnt buy an album to hear you yell your name over the song I wanna hear the song!!!!Someone needs to shut this ego maniac up and let the songs breathe.Just say no to kay slay!!"
4,Gaiman story is worth the price,"The Gaiman story in this collection is brilliant. There are other bright spots as well, particularly the contributions from Diana Paxson and Alan Dean Foster. Good, fun stuff."
4,Good For Carrying Around,"This small pocket sized dictionary does have a lot of words you can reference and it does fit in your pocket (a large pocket because it is somewhat thick). One could carry this around as you would walk through a German city for example to look up basic phrases and words. However, for more complex language needs such as reading magazines and books you are going to need a larger dictionary, and I found it totally inadequate for these latter needs. However, it is practically impossible to have both capacities built into one book, and thus I think this one does a good job for what it is."
2,Unconfortable,"These shoes look great on my shoe shelf, but are so uncomfortable that I've never actually worn them. The edges of the leather feel sharp and cut into my feet even though the size itself feels correct."
2,It rusts quickly,"This would've been great had it not rusted quickly. It is now disgusting & impossible to clean. Had it had some sort of protective coating to keep it from rusting & getting scummy it would've been great. My hair is all the way down my back plus (due to a thyroid condition) I lose a ton of hair daily. So, my hair clogs it up quickly resulting in water backup & hair floating in the tub. To avoid this I've picked it up, turned it over onto my hand, sprayed it with the shower, & the hair ball went into my hand. A little bit would still be in it sometimes but I could easily pick it out if I wanted to. I'd have to do this about 3 times per shower but again, I lose a lot of hair. If not for it getting disgusting I'd continue to use it. I'm now searching for something better."
1,rust,Purchased aug.2012 by dec. 2012 rusted into nothing. Stainless steel would not rust away. Do not buy this if you expect it to last.
1,Seems to be rusting ?,"After two days of sitting in the bathtub drain, reddish orange spots started to appear in the outer circle. More have continued to appear, into the mess area. It looks like it's rusting. When set on the bathtub edge, it left spots behind. They were able to be wiped up, but I don't know if it would have stained if left there longer. Not happy with the product."
1,Don't waster your time !,"Don't waste your time with this mesh strainer. In less than 3 weeks, not only was it covered in rust, but it also stained the rim of the bath drain with rust too!On top of that, it's difficult to remove the hair as the mesh is so thinly spaced out and the catcher is quite small - oh, and because the mesh is so small/thin, soap scum gets in there and then the water in the shower drains slowly! Argghhh!!All in all, I was very frustrated with this purchase :(Save yourself some time and get the ""Fox Run Sink and Tub Strainer"". Works very well, water flows through nicely, and it's super easy to remove the hair!Hope this review was helpful :-)"
5,Handy Mesh Strainers,"This is the only place I've been able to find these strainers and they work just perfect. Simple and inexpensive item but a real essential for keeping your drains flowing nicely! Great product, well made, PERFECT!"
2,Meh x 2.,"I should have taken better note of other reviewers' complaints. This strainer will, indeed, prevent absolutely everything from entering your drain: hair, soap, shampoo, and water. I just tossed mine, after a few months of use, when it started discoloring. If, however, you're looking to protect your drain while soaking your feet in slightly used bathroom products, then this is your huckleberry."
4,An intense dark drama.,"When a moody, wandering Ex-Boxer (Jason Partic) who may or may not be as punch drunk as he seems. When he meets a beguiling widow (Rachel Ward) and ex-detective turned Con Man (Bruce Dern) and then they get mixed-up in a Kidnap-Ransom scheme that turns soon into a living hell.Directed by James Foley (Glengarry Glen Ross) has made a stylish thriller with atmosphere dominate this gritty adaptation of Jim Thompson`s hardboiled novel. Jason Partic gives a terrific outstanding performance in this one. Fine Performances by Ward and Dern. Super 35. Grade:A-."
2,Vlad's Guide to Financial Swindles,"In this plodding tale of Vlad, much talking is done about a banking financial swindle happening. Like Vlad investigates Enron, but not that much fun. In order to help Savn, who saved Vlad previously Vlad must help out an old lady with the power to possibly heal Savn. This leads to the investigation of the financial swindle.Vlad and Kiera play Joe Hardy and Nancy Drew, except again, it really isn't that fun. The book is dialog heavy and as exciting as my accounting textbook, maybe less so.As others have said, the revelation in the last 10 pages is the only payoff for reading the book. Not worth it in my opinion."
4,Enjoyable Pool Lounger,"This is the 4th King Kool Lounger we've had. We've had a pool in two houses over an 18 year period & have always had one of these. It was great to find one on-line since we couldn't find one in the store anymore. They're tough, but eventualy wears out from the kids jumping on it. It's really for the wife. She loves it!!!"
5,Absolutely Awsome!,"I was a little warry of the live CD thing at first, because I thought there was no way in hell that some sound guys could capture the excitement and spontinaity of an Old 97's live show, but they did a very good job. When I listen to the CDs it transports me back to the shows I saw in the spring and summer, and what a great time I had. The Old 97's are by far the best live band out there right now, and the songs never fail to put a smile on my face!So thank-you Old 97's for releasing such an awesome set. My ears and memory thank you as well."
4,"great product, bad handle","This came to me super fast. I like it far better than the toddy. Makes great espresso for my chilled drinks. The only complaint I have is the handle. It is not attached and slides out easily. I have had a couple mishaps with the handle, so I am going to glue it in place. Other than that I would recommend the Filtron all day long.......so easy to use and clean.....love it."
2,Boring Book,"Not only were we told who and what everyone did as the up front, but the 'everyones' were numerous with more and more being added as the story went on. By the end of the book I didn't care who got caught from the group of characters who were bad and who found a happy ending to their 'angelic' lives."
4,I am the Ice Worm,"This book gives a sensitive view of the changing Eskimo culture in Alaska. Maryann Easley is an author who captures your attention. I use this book in conjunction with teaching students about cultures and polar regions. While it's written about the 1970's, it's message is applicable today. It has been recently republished by Scholastic, Inc. with a new title ""Alone in the Ice World""."
3,Nostalgia Restored!,"Thank you for finally making ""The Secret World of Alex Mack"" available!!!! It was so much fun reliving my childhood watching this show. Bad acting and special effects aside, the feeling I got when Alex was doused in the GC-161 was priceless. Thank you again!"
3,OLD.,"not sure just how old this stuff is but i'm 20 and its more like for my 60 year old dad. strong distrubing smell i like something clean and fresh. 3 stars though, it could be worse"
5,good buy!,"same product, much better price. Shippped promptly in good condition with sample product! I'll do this again. Thanx!!"
3,No lid on boxes,"I purchased two bottles of the 2.5fl oz perfume as a gift for someone. It arrived really really really well wrapped, which was excellent. I had to sign for it, which was excellent because I was home and I'd hate perfume to sit out in the sun deteriorating. Although, if i hadn't been home it would have been a nuisance not to have it just left on the doorstep.The big and not so great surprise is that the two boxes of perfume that arrived don't have a top to them. The pink box with Beautiful written on it looks perfect until you see that the top of the box is ripped off.The site says that it the perfume is un-boxed and I think I would have been totally fine receiving just the bottles on their own. But, when they actually arrived in the correct boxes but ones that have been oddly damaged, I start to wonder if they is something dodgy about what I just spent $130 on."
3,This one was slow!,"Just like the title, it was slow but it had its moments! I enjoy Minnie Driver's acting but I bought it because of Stuart Wilson who as usual, does such a superb job! I liked the story line but it seemed really ""drawn out"" to me. Thought it was never going to end. If you like Stuart Wilson, you'll still love this one as I did."
4,Good book for those who have a deep love of lists and organization! -[...],"I used this book when planning my move and found it to be very helpful. I was movig across country and had lots of valuable items that needed to be kept track of and properlu insurec. After a previously bad moving experience I wanted to make sure that i got everything right this time around. This book was a huge help, I especially liked all of the lists and organizational aids that were included in it."
5,Powerful!,"As an aspiring school administrator, I bought this CD because I kept hearing Senge's name come up time and time again in the change literature. Listening to the CDs, I felt both inspired and englightened ... suddenly, all that I had read, learned, and experienced about change began to make sense. Situations where change had been foiled, colleagues had been ""frozen,"" and reforms failed began to make sense thanks to Senge's framework. Best of all, I feel as though I have a strategy to ensure that future reform efforts are more effective, rather than destined for failure.The CD is a mixture of both a professional reader and Senge himself. Both are lively, however, and you will find yourself returning to their words time and time again for answers."
4,So Simple that We Avoid It...,"Senge's lessons are indeed invaluable. However, it sometimes seems that when we start making causal diagrams (certainly not a ""casual"" effort), the sheer scope of consequences can be very intimidating.However, I've never read a book which created a stronger sense of responsibility. Whatever we do has huge influences.On the optimistic side, it was here that I also learned of the concept of ""Creative tension."" What a powerful idea: having an overabundance of resources can act as an enemy to creativity and systems thinking. On the grandest scale, this reminds me now, fifteen years later, of the condition of the Chinese or Indian economy as compared to that of the U.S.We could use some creative tension here, I think."
4,mental models,"after reading the fifth discipline textbook, i think this book will educate people to used this fifth discipline in the company, and on the reality."
4,This book is fantaaaastic!,"This book was very helpful in understanding systems in your life. I purchased the book for an engineering class, but to my surprise, it was not based off of engineering principles. This made it much easier to read through. It was very informative on how to live your life. The book really made me realize how to understand and work with other people. It is very uplifting and pro employee rather than management. A little hard to understand at times, but overall, a good read."
3,Child In Time Calling For Gillan from Bombay,"There is nothing to add to the title - apart from an overdose of Jefferson Airplane influence, although male vocals - very much in the standard of music-hall - might be considered as interesting.P.S. On the other hand, I have to admit that live album -It's a Beautiful Day at Carnegie Hall- turned out to be powerful and is well worth 5 stars"
5,Tiffany - The Color of Silence,"This CD has not gotten the attention or airplay that it deserves. From the the first track, ""Open My Eyes"" to the last, ""Butterfly"", (my domestic CD does not have the bonus tracks) the entire CD catches you and won't let go. Tiffany is back and writing about personal experience, I would recommend this CD to anyone. It is a rarity to come across a disc where every song grabs you and takes you on a ride. Let's hope this gets distributed to the airwaves before it fades away."
5,completely satisfied arrived on time and in good condition,I am satisfied with this CD it arrived on time and in great conditionColor of Silence
5,Nothing better!,"Carole King at her best. Inspired. Can't listen to it too many times. ""Coincidentally"" pertinent to our post-9/11 world."
5,Handle,Product was exactly as advertised. Fit perfectly only 5 minutes to install. Only color was black but I needed a handle.
3,Is that all there is?,"This really wasn't long enough to develop characters, plot etc.It was OK, but substandard as far as typical Anne Rice goes. I was sorry I wasted my money on it."
1,Too easily removed,We've bought other brands of disposable bibs before (Sassy) and loved them. These were a good deal on Amazon so I thought they'd be the same. These were too easy for my daughter to just give a slight tug and pull off. She'd whip it off as soon as I had it on her neck. Returned to Amazon hassle free.
1,i hate these,"these stay on with sticky adhesive, not velcro like other brands, and always sticks to my daughters' hair. needless to say, it causes a lot of discomfort and crying when the bib is removed. will not buy this product again and definitely do not recommend to others."
2,$$ is right,"Honestly, thought I would use these while going out to restaurants but they're more of a nuisance than anything.Convenient for sure (when you have time to plan) but just not practical in a working parents world."
1,"Sorry, but don't waste your time","I hate to add my ""two cents"" to what is apparently a concensus that this books kinda sucks, but I have to agree that after reading about 2/3 of the way through this book, I'm pretty sorry I spend good money on it. I guess I was sort of attracted to the ""for twentysomethings"" label, but honestly it I can't imagine it would help anyone who has more than a high school education."
4,errr... enlightening,well ... this was kinda gross.... true about the dont read if under 15... i am 15 and it got me feeling quezy... this book certainly discripes things differently from most other books such as the A-List or the Au Pairs or those gossip books where girls are getting laid every minute. i certainly didnt get most of the... err... 'parts' and it got me squirming as well as thinking.... i mean do guys really give names... like 'ralph'? ANyway the end of the book was a rather a let down... the 'love' described prooved so weak that Kath couldn't even last 5 weeks without Michael... this book definately gets you thinking about 'love'... True love... if 'love' was what was in the relationship between kath n michael then how on earth could kath have fallen for theo after a few weeks? it doesnt make sense... anyway this book is great... but its a bit too much for me... being 15...
3,"No, it can't really be forever","The characters are naturally described. While Kath and Michael thought their love was forver, it was all blown out in one summer"
5,a great book,I really liked the reality of this book. The charactors were as close to real as they get. It is a great example of the loss of innocense. MUST READ!
1,It doesn't happen in real life.,"The basic idea of the book was okay. In fact, it was a good idea. Judy Blume attempted to capture and put into words the life of a ""normal"" teenage girl.Katherine is supposedly a normal teenage girl who falls in love with Michael, a guy that is her age. They get closer and they become more active - mentally and physically. Eventually, they have a sexual relationship that they believe will go on forever. Often there are sexual and very graphic scenes introduced in this book.Yes, people, especially today's teenagers need to get a proper sexual education. However, I do not believe this is the way to do that. This book shows people that it is okay to have sex as long as there is protection. This is not a book to be taken seriously. It doesn't happen in real life."
4,Great read,I read this book when I was a teenager and it was wonderful. I have read it many many times and I have still held on to it over the years. Highly recommended for any young lady.
2,Not for younger girls,My 11 yr old daughter wanted this book - I flipped through it and was really surprised at the content (for an 11 yr old). I told her it was meant for older girls and we then talked about sex being a very good thing when the time is right... - but that this book was not for her yet. I'm thinking maybe high scoool?? I'm just gald that I reviewed it myself first. Again not a bad book - just NOT for younger girls.
5,i loved the book it is wonderfully written,i enjoied this book very much it is about a teenage love-sexual relationship i felt it was very factual and true it could really happen it was so good i have read it 5 times
5,READ IT!!,"OK WELL, I AM JUST AN ORDAINARY GUY, SITTING HEAR IN THE LIBIARY WHEN I SEE IT LAYING ON THE TABLE, I PICK IT UP AND READ THE FIRST PAGE, I AM LIKE AHH OK. WELL I CHECK IT OUT, AND WHEN I GET HOME, BOOM IT GETS BETTER AND BETTER. IT EXCELLENT, AND MADE ME FEEL LIKE I WAS PART OF THE BOOK. IF YOU LIKE IT AS WELL E-MAIL MENGEWAR4521@YAHOO.COMTHANKS"
4,Forever by Judy Blume,"This book is a heart warming tale by Judy Blume which expreses the first experience of true love. Kath and her friend Erica go to a new years party and meet a guy. His name is Michel. Kath and Michel start dating. They love each other so much that they say i'll love you forever. Kath has her very first experirence with a guy, and Michel has the time of his life. Then one day Kath and Michel are forced to seperate. Kath's parents make her go to a summer school for a job. Michle has to go and help his uncle and help him lumber wood for money. They both have to go to differnt states and are sparated for seven weeks. they write every day to each other. Will Kath and Michel ever see each other again??? I would recomend this book to a cirtin age group. should be for mature teens and adults. I do think this book should be band because of the graphics. I rated this book a four because it was a good book, but I woldnt read it again because of the graphics."
3,judy,At first I wasn't liking the story that much but the story got better as it went along but I wish that the story felt more real. I mean it was good but I never believed that Michael loved Katherine like he said he did. He only wanted to have her and that was that. The other stories and characters are much more interesting than Michael and Katherine also. Their stories had my mouth drop to the floor so that definetly kept me reading. And it saved the book from being boring.
2,Not great,"I, like most girls, only read the book for the ""dirty"" parts. (Which, now that I'm older, don't seem so dirty and descriptive.) I am so surprised that so many people identified with the characters. I still think they're bland and one-dimensional; I never felt for one instant that they could be real people with feelings and emotions. Although they're suppossedly in ""love"", we never really see them dating or falling in love. It just seems to jump straight to the sex. Another part that surprised me was how unconcerned Katharine is when she finds out her boyfriend's had VD from unprotected sex. She just seems to shrug it off. Although it was written in the 70's, the dialogue and conversations don't seem realistic either. Maybe it's just me, but I think this book could have been better."
3,Meh...,"Given that it was written in a totally different time period than the present, there are many things that have to be taken into account. For example, what was romantic then may not be romantic nowadays. There was also the issue of women's rights, double standards, and just societal expectations of gender roles that just made me itch with irritation. I didn't need to read this book in order to get the message. Its really straightforward and predictable."
1,weird,so im on my brothers account just so you know. im a girl. i hated the book. i didn't know it was about sex and did not enjoy the book at all. i didnt even finish. the whole book was boring and not real. by the way im 15. ugh. hated this book.
4,teaching book,It is an excellent book for pre-teenagers to read to learn about some of the questions they have for life.
2,unique subject matter does not buy artistic merit,"I'll keep this short. Yes, this is a fairly unique book; in my experience, I have yet to come across another. The writing, however, is truely dreadful. It reads like a typical high school student wrote it. Some things mentioned, like preferences to lox on bagels, are amazingly tedious and quite inconsequential to the story as a whole. As a work of art, it is sub-par. As a ground-breaking subject for an adolescent novel, it does well. Most innocence-lost books are much more dramatic, but atypical drama would defeat the purpose here. Read it if you want to hear of an everyday, ho-hum, teenager dealing with her first relationship and loosing her virginity. It will sound very much like your own, perhaps, and very much like all the stories you've heard from your friends. Don't read it if you prefer depth in plot & exploration of character, for that's not the point of this book's existence."
1,FOREVER,"First, I want to say that I read most of the reviews. All the reviewers who said ""Forever"" was a great book are wrong. Sex is special. It is something that should be saved for marrige. Sure, go ahead, have it before marrige but in the end all you gain is bad memories and regret. Kathy can like Theo and maybe even marry him, but she'll still have that memory of her time with Micheal. I know Kathy is a fictional character, but there are a lot of Kathys in the world. Judy? Are you trying to make millions of girls end up like Kathy? Many of girls are making Kathy their role model. It says in the Bible to not have sex before marrige. Maybe some people would say I'm making too big of a deal of this, but there are thousands of girls affected by this book. I'm not immature or old fashioned. Not every girl in the world can afford to be like Kathy. I am sure many parents do not want a book teaching their girl how to have sex. Judy Blume should be ashamed of herself."
2,"it's okay, but disappointing.","I expected it to be a MUCH deeper book, but it's actually quite...shallow. It's just like everything in the story revolves on Katherine and Michael being together. yes, the story is supposed to focus on that, but it revolves on that almost too much, plus the fact that the story develops too fast. It's an okay book, but not the kind worth raving about."
5,Breathtaking!,I really liked this book. It explained what all teenagers are curious about. A teenage must have!
4,Judy Blume has readers entertained with great book for Y.A.,"I was very satisfied with the book ""Forever. . ."" by Judy Blume. I am a romance novel lover, and this was just the book to keep me entertained. It is about two high school seniors named Katherine (Kath) and Michael. They fall madly in love very soon, and they end up always having sex. kath was not ready for that at first, but then she decides that since they love each other they should do it. I read the book in about one day. I am a fast reader, but I just couldn't put the book down. The book can get very graphic at times (whenever ""Ralph"" comes into the picture..) but it is raelly very enjoyable. I would not reccomend this to young teens. It is suitable for high school students and adults."
3,Nice story,Nice story but didn't share it with youth group as I was affraid it would be a little dull for them.
5,Parallel universes and humor,"This is my favorite book of Foster because I find it to be the one that expands my mind the most. It also made me laugh at times as the main character encounters numerous odd situations and beings. A stimulating mix of physics, philosophy, science, humor, and big thoughts. Parallel universes and humor. This reminds me a little bit of Heinlein's work."
4,A clever satire,"An author should not have to stamp ""satire"" on the cover of a book to have readers look at it in the proper light. Parallelities is a light satire which has many clever twists. I found this book much more enjoyable than the lionized ""Hitchhiker's Guide"".Foster begins with an aura that suggests the standard serious SF genre. However, the book quickly becomes a light-hearted ride thorough a series of unreal universes. The writing is crisp, with many ""tongue-in-cheek"" situations. I agree that Mr.Foster began to fade a bit toward the end. However, the book overall provided a pleasant afternoon's reading. This is not ""Dune"" or even ""Hyperion"", but is not meant to be."
3,It's not the Commonwealth,"I've been a fan of Foster since I was about 8 or 10. I've read at least a dozen of his books, and this one certainly doesn't rank well among them. If you're used to The Damned, or Flinx in the Commonwealth, this book will no doubt leave you sadly disappointed.When I first read this book, it was for an English Independent Study, and I read it along side HG Wells' War of the Worlds. Compared to Wells' incredibly long, slow descriptions, Parallelities was fast paced and well developed. Foster has the gift of quickly creating memorable worlds and characters. However, the nature of this book requires them to be discarded just as fast as they're created.Alongside War of the Worlds, this was a welcome change from the tedium of 19th Century England. However, when looked at in a more modern light, Foster could have done better.Without intending to offend anybody, Foster should stick to stories of the Humanx Commonwealth, his incredible namesake."
3,NOT for Mac :(,"I saw a friend's kid playing it and it looks like fun, however I was disappointed to know that it doesn't work on the Mac.The Mac being the computer most used in schools should be considered when designing computer games these days and the thought should come by default to software companies. I guess I'll have to settle to Blue's Clue's, Dora the Explorer, Putt-Putt and Pajama Sam for now until they (if they ever do) release it for Macintosh.I would have given it 5 stars if they made it for Macintosh and I actually could buy it (therefore)."
5,excess in moderation,"I recently came to the conclusion that this is without a doubt the best Stanhope money can buy. He really won the crowd over on this one and you can tell he's having a good time. Some of the most hilarious bits he's ever performed are on here too, like ""Big Rubber Fist"", ""Live Life"", ""Destroying Your Body"" and also what absolutely has to be one of the best closers i've ever heard on any comedy album which is ""Bobbie Barnett"". I also like the use of the acoustic guitar all throughout the performance. Overall, this is a more ""intimate"" show compared to his others, which I think really holds up for repeated listenings more than more than most of his other albums."
2,It's Aight!,"Her Re-Mix of What's the 411 had some tight Mixes&added Punch to some of the tracks.but this set only has a few Aight Mixes&really doesn't push any Ground.something about this release speaks of Contract Obligation as to anything else really pushing it.She needs a Steve ""Silky"" Hurley or Frankie Knuckles to tweak up the Music here."
1,Not worth even one star,"Im not suprized that Llewyllyn publishers have dipped their hands into hoodoo. Llewyllyn is known for being a publisher who will put just about anything on the market as long as it makes money without caring wether or not the information is acurate. Ray Malbrough has written this book claiming to reveal the ways of hoodoo and conjure, he is sadly mistaken. I can't caution you enough to not waste your time and money on this book. Visit the lucky mojo website if its hoodoo information your after. I will say in Ray Malbroughs defense however that his other 2 books, also published by Llewyllyn arent all bad, still, they are llewyllyn so draw your own conclusions."
2,Stopped working after 3 months,"Lamp and bulb are as advertised. However, the fixture blew after 3 months of use. Would have expected it to last at least a year."
4,Hydro farm,"It was easy to clamp in a handy spot, and to direct the light at my Meyers lemon tree. We use a timer to provide the lemon with 12 hours of day light on these short winter days. We din't have room or where-with-all to put a green house in our condo. Maybe we should look into getting a hydro system to continuously water the tree also."
2,my plants are dying!,"I bought this growth light because my dorm room doesn't get that much sunlight. For some reason, my strawberry plant is dying like the light isn't doing anything good for them. I moved the growth light back thinking that it was burning my plant but no improvement. It seems like an ordinary light bulb with no benefits."
3,Meh,"It's a decent price, but the product is a bit flimsy and for some reason one of my bulbs broke out of nowhere."
5,Disturbing and Alive,This book makes you not want to eat meat for a long long time. It's very emotional and real. Informative and scary. An excellent read.
3,First Novels - Both good and poor,"The only word to describe the ending is ""trite."" Ms. Ozeki leads us through an interesting series of events in the life of a free lance doucumentarian. Jane's ""Year of Meats"" bounces off a lot of ""PC"" issues from ""good men"" to environmental concerns.What shows here is her potential. She created good charachters and had a sound plot line. For those of us who like first novels it was a good read. I will be looking forward to her next work and truly hope it is in process as I write this. Yes, it could have been better. I'm sure her next work will be."
3,"pc, but palatable","I generally shun anything pc, but luckily when I picked this up from the new book section at the library, I had no idea that it was--I'm just interested in fiction set in or about Japan. It gets a little far fetched at the end, as do all the coincidences that tie the whole thing up just a little too neatly, but it's worth reading because Jane is such a great character. Ilove her over the top polite communications with her boss where she is really saying explaining exactly how she is going to screw him. Wish I didn't like to eat hamburgers so much after reading this."
1,dont buy it,I bought this thinking it would be just what I needed. It removed very little from the air and it stopped working in a few months. save your money and get something better
4,Mother Tongue,"On completion of the book Mother Tongue, I was truly impressed by the book's ability to capture its readers. This book is not only filled with wonderful poems, but the author provides an insight to his life and his years of growing up with his family. Mother Tongue takes the readers on a journey of a raging child's life. This is done so that the readers are able to understand the character's emotions. The poems show the author's pain and anger as he grows up with his family and at the end it shows his forgiveness with the beautiful poem, The Pieta."
4,Autobiographical Poems,"Mother Tounge:A Broken Hungarian Love Song by Peter Hargitai is a book of poems that show what he went through in his life. From the times he lived in Hungary to when he came to America. From when he lived with his aunt to when he fell deeply in love with who is now his wife. You can tell he suffered a lot during his life and he took it all out on paper. All the anger and disappointment was seen in his poems, most of them although were about his mom. He showed great dismay towards how he was treated by his own moher and how he was accepted and her son. Even though the book is filled with saddness and anger towards his mother you can tell he really lves her in he way he ended the book with the poem titled The Pieta."
4,Mother Tongue - Peter Hargitai,"What a unique collection of poems all in one book. It is full of raw and powerful emotions which Peter Hargitai is not afraid to express. His emotions are true and deep. The poems range from deep and powerful to funny and romantic. By far this is one of the best collections of poems that I have come across by a single poet. It tells the story about the relationship with his mother that he never had and from his childhood in Hungary to his life as an adult in modern day America and in between. It is an essential book, especially if you read Attila: A Barbarian Love Story, which I also highly recommend. It's full of raw and powerful poetry that make is even more fascinating."
4,Poems of the soul,"The author shows pictures of his soul through the writings in this collection of poems. Poems like ""Waving Goodbye"" are full of pain. The author writes uniquely,but freely. He expresses his feelings of sorrow, anger, unforgiveness, love, desire and loneliness in this collection. Even first time experiences are shown here like "" My wife becomes a mother"". We really see a piece of stages in Hargitai's life through his poems. It is a great book to inspire one to write about our feelings. a great teacher to shoqw us how to put what we can't say or show into words."
5,A Child's Revenge,"We are presented with a book of poems that express the real feelings of a distraught man, who holds nothing back. Hargitai writes for an audience that wants relief of their own suppressed feelings and has never been able to convey their hidden emotions. It deserves applause for its purity and stripped feelings. The words were brought together to express a child's longing for love and revenge. This book of poems communicates feelings of separation, anguish, betrayal, death and many more real subjects. Hargitai lets the reader into his nightmares, dreams, and past experiences without censors. The true anguish felt by the author bleeds through every page, and until the end when he asks for forgiveness, it seems he attempts to find revenge through his poems. Mother Tongue deserves to be recognized for its reality, truth, and passion"
1,Dead On Arrival,"Beautiful keychain picture viewer looks like it would hold up well in a purse. Unfortunately the one I got would only work while plugged in to a USB cable, otherwise had no power. Amazon was great about the RMA!"
3,TAO 1.5-Inch Digital Keychain Frame (Brushed Metal),"This is my second order of this brand of keychain. The first one was the smaller size of the TAO and then I ordered two of the 1.5"" keychains. The 1.5"" only holds 30 to 32 pictures whereas the smaller screen TAO will hold 50 or more. I had to send one of the 1.5"" TAO's back as the picture was so dark and even if I lightened the pictures to the lightest they were still dark. That is why I will only rate this product a three. The picture quality was pretty good and you can crop and adjust the brightness of the pictures with the software that comes with the product. My daughter really likes this product."
1,I wouldn't recommend this for anyone,"The biggest problem I have with this unit (TAO 1.5-Inch Digital Keychain Frame (Brushed Metal))is the color of the pictures. The brightness of each photo is horrible. The detail of the picture is pretty good, but the contrast of colors is bad! I wouldn't recommend this as a gift to anyone."
1,Garbage!,I bought this for my wife as a Christmas stocking stuffer. The style and craftmanship was as expected. Loading the images was easy. The digital image I loaded was from a 8mp camera but the image displayed was around a 1mp and was very very washed out almost to the point of not being able to see the picture. It would not turn on unless I pluged it into a power outlet even after charging overnight. Overall a dont buy item.
1,"Great for awhile, but...","I was very impressed when I received it. It came in a nice box and it is a very substantial, solid feeling item. The software was very easy to use and the keychain displayed the photos with clarity and good color rendition. Unfortunately, it totally stopped working after a month. Too late to return to Amazon. It is a waste of money and Amazon should no longer sell this product. Beware!"
3,"Good, but heavy","I purchased this item thinking it would be nice to have as my keychain. Although the mechanism itself is great and the resolution pretty good, it's a bit heavy for a keychain."
1,Poor Quality And Service,"Simply, this unit was bought as a gift for my wife to show pictures of the new baby. It would not charge properly and gave the unclear pictures a red tint. I e-mailed customer service 2 weeks ago and still have not heard back. I sent it back to amazon last week."
1,Don't bother...multiple failures,"I purchased four of these for Christmas, and 3 of the 4 tested so far do not work out of the box...the displays are gray and washed out, and the units only work when plugged in. I will be returning all of the units purchased due to this experience...it's a shame to give gifts that don't work! Save your money and get one from an electronics store where you can test the unit before purchasing as problems with many of the digital photo key chains seem to be widespread."
1,Battery never worked,"Tried to buy it for a Christmas gift, but never could get the battery to charge up properly. Did run on AC, but not on the battery. Colors were pretty washed out anyway and lines running through it. I know it's more of a cheap, novelty, but the quality was even poorer than I expected. No phone for a TAO help desk, so I had to e-mail them, but they never responded, so I returned it. Amazon is great about returns though. Appreciate that."
4,excellent and a half,"Forget the garage rock ofHad Too Much to Dream. That and this version of the Electric Prunes have only name in common.Better to think of the windowpane church fright ofMass in F Minor. The dark orchestrations of David Axlerod that made that so unique are also on Release Of An Oath: Searing acid guitars, footsteps of God bass, echoing gothic drums.This is the 3:47 in the morning 1968 FM music that everyone but hardcore music people, and perhaps sampling DJs, forgot. Amazing both for its historical strangeness and obscurity and for its overriding nuance.GET IT"
2,Electric Prunes - 'Release Of An Oath' (Collector's Choice Music),"Every bit as much of a true disappointment as this Electric Prunes imposter (technically speaking) band's 'Just Good Old Rock And Roll'. Only two cuts here that did anything for me at all were ""Holy Are You"" and maybe ""Individual Confession"". Plus, what's up with the duration of a measly 24 minutes? I'm sure someone could've easily located some old radio spots, live tracks, odd Prunes cuts of some sort within their vaults."
1,Meh...,"The first 2 tracks were recorded by the original band, but when they didn't record the material (which they didn't write and had forced on them basically) fast enough, they got replaced by session musicians... their contract didn't even let them have rights to their band name. So the first 2 tracks are theirs, though not really, and the rest aren't. I was disappointed with it... its not horrible music, but its not the Prunes."
2,Not the best for learning ASL,This is definitely not a book I would ever recommend for teaching or learning ASL! I took over a high school ASL program and this was the book the previous teacher chose to teach from. I immediately changed curriculum and started teaching the language correctly. I had extraordinary issues trying to reteach the proper aspects of ASL after the students had been incorrectly taught.
5,Great prog/power metal from PA!,"I first saw Order of Nine back when they were called Templar and they opened for Symphony X in Pittsburgh. I was impressed then, and still am. This album is great and it's too hard to pick favorite songs. Vocalist Michael DeGrena sounds somewhat like Geoff Tate, so this album should appeal to fans of Queensryche. Both the vocals and the instruments are outstanding. Highly recommended to fans of progressive and power metal!"
3,More of the same... but not as good,"After sampling a freebie Jake Lassiter book, I started reading the series. This is the fourth one I read & must admit I was somewhat disappointed. Similar formula to his other books, so much so that many of the characters were predictable. Others have described the plot, so I won't go further into it. I will say that by the end of the book, I was just ready for the thing to be over with. Maybe the next in the series will be better, but if you are considering buying this one, I'd say skip it and go with another of the series."
2,False Dawn,I expected a mystery or adventure book and after six or seven chapters still was reading meaninfless words. Not at all interesting to me.
3,Missed its vocation,"If this book was a study of the workings of two nations and their day to day dealings then there is much to enjoy and learn from it. However, the book is supposed to explain the differences between the US and the UK, which in parts it does, but only when dealing with the upper echelons of the two countries. I got the impression that the author probably wouldn't know Mr and Mrs average Brit if they came up to him in the street and introduced themselves. He was quick to point out several times that the Americans haven't trusted the British for two hundred years(and probably still dont). A whole chapter on cricket, with just a passing mention of Football? Cricket may be the national sport in his exulted circles but what about the other 99% of the population? Although disapointing in parts it is still worth a read as the author is definatly knowlegable about his subjects and does come across as a decent man."
5,Excellent,"Saved me the first time I used it. Driving on an empty road in the middle of nowhere picked up Highway Patrol about 4 miles out. If I didn't have it he would have been very angry, you know what I mean. Not one false KA band hit. Even got one where Highway Patrol was driving/hiding in front of a bus, he got someone else. It pick up those radar signs showing your speed on the K band. A few K and X false hits but no big deal."
4,Nice but,"The unit is reliable and works nicely.I take away one star because of itsirritating default sound setting. It blastslike a siren inside the car, whichis utterly stupid. You are not tryingto wake up anyone; the driver is already awake.the sound is louder than my smoke alarm inthe house. If I had known this I wouldNOT have purchased it."
2,Bel V955,"do not recommend this detector as if you leave it on your windshield for any period of time of inactivity, it takes several minutes in front of the AC vent before it cools down enough to start working again."
4,Don't know yet,"I'm confused about some of the specs on this unit. Bel is supposed to be the best detector out now. I did some research on their site and they say it's 8x vs. imports. They don't say 8x ""what"" vs. imports but it's 8x ""something"" vs. imports. Kinda gives you a warm, fuzzy feeling knowing you're buying American. So I ordered it.The UPS truck pulled up a few days later and the driver knocked on my door. I sniffed his butt. He sniffed mine and after we verified identities he handed me the package. I ran into the house and eagerly ripped open my new toy. I was proudly admiring the box and one of the first things I noticed was Made in Canada. This is where the confusion comes in. Don't we import stuff from Canada? Did Canada become the 51st state while I was sleeping? What's going on here?Anyway, no tickets after a couple weeks so 4 stars based mostly on Bel's reputation."
2,Failure,This item caused a failure of the computer in my 2006 Corvette. I plugged it in the cigarettelighter and five minutes later my dashboard lights went out as did all the computer functions. When I unplugged it all the functions returned. I would love to get rid of it but don't know how.
1,Questionable at best.,"I bought the unit to replace a 40 dollar Cobra unit that failed after a year. Tested the unit with a 2000 mile road trip right off the bat, and have been using it in the city for the last month.1. The range is poor, I would say no more than 1000 yards when set on highway, even less when set to auto detect. At any rate it doesn't inspire confidence as it generally doesn't pick up a speed trap until maybe a second before it is in view.2. The window mount is ok, not great, and the power cord is short and coiled, very overt.Overall I regret buying it, poor performer compared to my old Cobra and cost 3x as much. I would have been better of buying a new 40 dollar unit every year."
1,Beltronics...Juck radar detector.,"Got 3 tickets with this detector, not because I didn't react quick enough...because the detector didn't even detect the radar and didn't do its job. Don't waste your money! The first one I returned due to calibration failure. That one got me a ticket. The second detector...the officer said he got me with Lazer. That didn't work either. 2 detectors...2 tickets, you make the call. Beltronics won't refund money for tickets, even for a failed product."
4,A little worried,"This detector seems to work fine for the most part. It has given me ample warning a number of times. However, I must say I was a little worried the other day when driving along and I passed one of those signs that displays your speed; this thing didn't make a peep. It usually works for those signs as they are normally K-band or something like it, but this time it was silent. The sign was on and showed my speed, so I know it was hitting me with something, and my detector didn't say anything. So who knows. Other than that I find the sound rather annoying, and it gives a lot of false warnings with door-motion detectors. But I guess nothing can be done about that."
3,"Okay light for the price, requires some extra work and patience","I got this light in early March and the bulb burned out in under two weeks. I was aware of this potential problem and babied the lamp as soon as it arrived--it really is a manufacturing issue. That was the bad part. With a little bit of work, I contacted the company and inquired about the 1 year warranty. They acknowledge the manufacturing problem and replaced the original bulb with a Prepara Power Growbulb, which is a 25 watt compact flourescent grow bulb. If this lasts as long as a typical flourescent bulb, then I think this will actually have been a good deal. Just understand that if you buy this, you WILL have to replace the bulb, but it won't cost you anything extra. If you know that up front, it's really not a big deal.Otherwise, it's seems like a fairly well made. The power chord is only about 3 feet long, so you may need an extension chord, depending on where you need to put it. The clamp feels strong and solid."
2,Broken Light Bulb,Received the lamp yesterday. Bulb was broken and cannot find a local replacement. Very disappointing.
2,bulb lasted less than 2 weeks,The lamp housing looks and feels very well made but the bulb from agro-sun burned out after about 10 days. Not cool!
2,Kind of useless,"This DVD teaches individual steps, but does not put them together for ease of learning any actual dances. So if that's what you're looking for, I'd suggest not wasting your money on it."
5,Learning Irish dance,Great DVD for both my daughter and myself. Great addition to our lessons and becoming a Father/Daughter team.
5,It takes time,"I have taken 6 years of American tap and making a change to Irish dance is not easy. I think that Irish dance takes alot, AlOT of pacience. I focused on the soft shoe dancing first and it is really fun and a great workout. Jean Butler demostrates the steps barefoot, which is great because its much easier to see every movement. For someone who has never taken any kind of dance class, it is going to take alot of time. None should expect to go through the dvd once and be ready to perform in Riverdance. I recommend getting some type of tap shoe before starting the taps section. My old taps are too small so I tried it barefoot and you really won't get the feel of the rytmn until you have tap shoes. If you have little or none experience this dvd is great to play around with and have fun with. I really enjoy it."
3,What Were They Thinking?,"The the instruction and performances on this DVD could not be better. Unfortuantely, somebody decided to dress everyone in BLACK clothes to dance with a black background!! It makes it almost impossible to view."
1,You mean You Put His best Matches On At 85 Minutes.Very Bad,"I love Abdullah The Butcher but please if your going to put his best matches on a dvd then at least put 2 hours worth of them,not 85 minutes...This man deserves much more than this meaning his matches should have been placed on 2 discs and just do away with the soundtrack which really does not mean anything."
1,Because he IS high!,"""Because I Got High"" was probably the dumbest song of 2001...the lyrics sound like something that an eight-year-old would write. Yes, I know it was meant to be funny but it's really not. Getting ""high"" on drugs is not something to joke around about--EVER. It's a serious matter. It's not as though Afroman has had any other singles out since last summer...kind of like another one-hit wonder. Afroman is an okay rapper, but I wish he'd write more intelligent songs...something that people could take him seriously by. Plus, they played this on the radio so much that it's gotten very annoying! All Afroman raps about on his album, 'The Good Times', are drugs, drinking, sex, and violence. A very crude album and song. For anyone who's got even half of a brain, this cd is NOT recommended."
3,Good Enough,"Good points: Very compact, great price, suprisingly good text quality, good fax interface, good-enough copying, good looks. Generous packaging: print cable (surprise!), phone cord, phone line splitter, etc.Bad points: Bad up-take from the paper tray, no direct-from-camera printing, unacceptable quality on scanned photos, can't effectively print envelopes or heavy paper, seems rather cheaply made -- I fear about its life expectancy.The Bad Points are serious considerations, but the 4215xi still a great buy for $80. So, it's good enough for me. I gave it three stars but I'm a tough grader, and there was no ""half star"" option."
2,Terrible Terrible,Terrible Customer Service they are so rude when you call them.Hard to use item. Do not buy a COBY product.
1,You get what you pay for!!!!!,"I bought this Mp3 for my daughter for Xmas - not wanting to spend alot because of her age (12)- after ONE WEEK it wouldn't hold a charge, would not power down completely, and had to be reset every time we wanted to do ANYTHING with it!!!! Not worth the problems!!!!!"
4,i had no problems with it yet? i read the other reviews,"i bought it a walgreens for 107 bucks , i feel like i got a great deal, this is my first mp3 player, i bought it for its small size, i can take it to work and put it in my lunch box to entertain myself on breaks in my car, seems to keep a good charge on my unit , i have read the reviews seems some people got some bad units LOL! , it took me like 2 hours to learn how to load video MTV files, thier hard to find on the internet for free, start by searching for .mpeg files what ever you like can take some time to find mpeg files they are scarce now that streaming media rules the net. i have had my unit on for more than 12 hours stright the battery seems too be full ? hummm whens it going to run out?"
3,Battery,"The player holds a ton of songs. More songs than i can think of. The sound quality is great, but the battery life is very short. My mp3 only really plays for about an hour before dying. With no warning and with the battery meter full it drops down to nothing."
5,Love it,Not as much of the native american culture I like but still very well written and would read him again !
1,Too difficult to understand,"I purchased this book because I had a genuine interest in knowing about the works of Avicenna. But the text is written in such complicated sentence structure, english, and makes so many references to peoples/individuals that I did not know of, that I barely comprehended anything from it. I have an MD degree. This is definately not for the average or above average reader. If you are looking for an introductory text to the works of Avicenna, then look elsewhere."
2,A bit dry,It started out pretty good but then got boring. I wouldn't suggest this book to anyone. The cover made it look like it would be a good book.
1,Offensive in several ways,"This book is offensive if you are: female, single and over 50; if you are politically liberal; or if you are Jewish.The condescending tone to all of the above really took me by surprise. I do not understand why this book was received with such enthusiasm."
5,Great read!,"I read ""Instances of the Number 3"" by Vickers before I read this book. I thought maybe ""Miss Garnet's"" wouldn't be as good, but I was wrong! The interweaving of the two stories is well done and the shift from the one to the other does not interupt the flow. If you haven't ""discovered"" this author yet, you have a treat in store. I recommend her books highly."
2,The world is a shopping mall.,"The book is written in rhyme with a cadence closely resembling ""One, two, buckle my shoe."" It protrays a happy girl's life (Barbi's) revolving entirely around shopping, getting dressed and going out with boys. Ken has the presence of a manikin. There are many children's book that teach counting through rhyme and rhythm. Most that I have seen are more substantive, more human, and more fun than this book."
4,An enlightening history,"As I grow older, I worry sometimes about the aging 'muscle' in my head. I had noticed that Thomas Harris mentioned this book in the back of his novel Hannibal, so I ordered it; Not to be like the fictional Dr. Lecter, but rather to develop my memory and keep it honed.This is book about history, about discipline, about a passion. Spence knows his stuff, to be sure, but I find his style to be aggravating--the research is phenomnal and very much appreciated, but there are times when it interrupts the flow of the read. This is the only reason I give it four stars instead of five. Otherwise, it is a Five-star. I like the book immensely, and I am learning."
5,"I'm not sure what was ""wrong"" with Joy","It's been a few years since I read this, but the previous reviewer was right in that it was like being hit by a truck. That the family stayed as intact as it did through all this was a testament to the enormous love they did have for each other despite their conflicts.I have to disagree with the reviewer, and the author herself, that Joy was (is?) retarded, and I don't think she was autistic either. Her biggest obstacles appeared to be behavior anomalies not consistent with retardation or autism, and her severe reflux (to the point of vomiting many times a day, solved with an unnamed medication) and other medical problems make me suspect she had some unknown metabolic or chromosomal anomaly that wasn't identified, at least at that time. They probably labeled her ""retarded"" because they weren't sure what else to call her.If I come across the book again, I'll be sure to re-read it to see if my assessments were correct."
3,Not many new techniques that haven't been covered before,"Good book covering basics for beginners. Has skim reading, surveying and various methods for speed reading including paragraph analysis and idea organizationm but no new ideas. A little less emphasis on 'unlimited brain potential' and selling 'mind-mapping' would be refreshing though!"
4,Middle aged American carelessly romps through other's dreams,"I really liked this read, tho' l found Christopher Baker's relentlessly naive idealism a tad trying. His evaluation of Castro's Cuba, and people's aspirations of that dream; astride one of the most revered motorcycles in the world, he manages to run out of lubrication in both. He assumption the BMW would not need it's oil checked, and his point of view that Cuba could be entirely comparable to his concepts did succeed in irking me.I'm not saying l need some deft old philosophical bugger like Pirsig to do my travelogues, but perhaps someone a little more mature than Baker seems to be."
2,Mid Life Crisis,"Some men buy a red convertible. Some take a mistress. This is not news, nor newsworthy. Another title of this book could be, ""A Boy, A Bike and A Penis"". White male heterosexuality at it's banal worst. But then again, no one forced me to read it! If you want to know about the conditions in Cuba, this is NOT the book to read. If you want to live vicariously, it's all yours!"
5,A Far-out galactic voyage of the mind!,"Greg Howard, one of the first players on the exotic Chapman Stick. If you have never heard his work before, I would suggest you check out Stick Figures, it is way more acessable to someone just getting started with Greg or the Stick. If you have heard some of his other works, then check this out. This album plus Water on The Moon, are highlights of his one man improvisation with the stick and lead to some very interesting places. For me when I listen to this album Greg paints star fields, and nebula. His timbres make my mind wander the space, and take me on a sonic journey. Get this album, sit in a quiet dark room, close your eyes and travel the stars, its a hell of a ride! Being a stick player myself, this is not easy. Greg is a master of the instrument, and this CD is the master at work. Greg Howard and the Stick is the closest one can come to the Holophoner."
3,difficulty in starting.,Very difficult to make starts with short days and no sun. Using a warm bedroom in a window. I have not started the hydrofarm..
5,"""When You're Gone""...........ROCKS!!","I never really liked Bryan Adams, but his new song rules! When You're Gone, is now my all time Fav. song. I love it SO much because it reminds me of my boy-friend. We were together for a long time, and now he's gone away to work for a little while. It's so hard without him around, and I miss him So much. But I know that he will be home soon enough. Anyways, I LOVE THAT SONG, ""WHEN YUO'RE GONE""!!"
4,works well but needs on/off switch,"This works well at keeping the heating mat within a small temperature range. However, it would be much more convenient if it had an on/off switch. Currently, you have to unplug it to turn it off."
1,Didn't even last one season,"I used this with the the smallest of heat mats of the same brand, and it stopped working within one season. I followed all instructions, and for the high price of this thermostat, I am very disappointed in its performance, or lack thereof. Too bad, because in theory it's a great idea."
2,Oh I Give Up,"Boring characters and absolutely zero direction makes this series a chore to get through. The final story arc on this volume does manage to provide an interesting spark with the new character but with how easily and haphazardly the series moved past the last two story arcs, it seems easy to predict that this one won't get much better treatment on volume three. There is little anyone could say to convince me that the last volume of this series will end on a much stronger note."
2,Agree with zrine,"I have to agree with zrine. There are a lot of funny lines in this book, but the plot is as thin as the one-liners are funny."
5,The BEST flea market book I've seen,"Wow. Ilove it, I love it, I love it, I love it,I love it. Thanks to a story in Better Homes and Gardens magazine, I learned about this book. Picked it up at a local bookstore but got it from amazon, (because amazon's price is better). Why isn't amazon showing the cover on its site? This book is gorgeous,and it shows me lots of great ideas as well as lots of different styles so I can do my own thing. The author has the focus right -- this is about creating personal style, not about buying junk."
3,cute as a gift and sometimes useful facts to review,"I purchased this as a gift for a friend very into the domain of yoga, meditation and chakras. It was well received; and it appeared to be a well organized and informative little deck of cards."
3,Maybe if I were older and a woman,"Her humor seems to be aimed to older women. Well, at least I don't find it as funny as I had hoped. I have seen her on the View every once in awhile and I found her slightly humorous. Yet, her book gave me little to even smirk at. The topics seemed to have been overly done already and there was little added to them. Her speech at the Speaker Series was unorganized and very short. She did a somewhat better job while answering questions as she was able to feed off someone else."
5,awsome cool choice luv it baby,i thought this cd rocked. i cant stop lisning to it. definatley worth the money!
2,Not True Celtic,"PASS ON THIS ONE. THE ORIGINAL WAS OK, BUT IF YOU WANT GREAT MUSIC, GREAT DANCING, AWESOME SETS, TRULY CELTIC--EVEN WITH THE HUGE EGO OF MICHAEL FLATLEY, WHO IS, BY THE WAY AN EXTRAORDINARY TALENT, BUY HIS SHOW ""FEET OF FLAMES"" TOTALLY TOE-TAPPING AWESOME. THIS WILL BE NO DISAPPOINTMENT LIKE THE SO CALLED ""BEST OF RIVERDANCE"" IT HAS NO SPANISH DANCE, NO SPIRITUALS, NO HIP-HOP, NO RUSSIAN DANCE. ALL WELL AND GOOD FOR MANY. BUT FEET OF FLAMES IS TOTALLY IRISH & CELTIC, WHICHEVER YOU WANT TO CALL IT. EMMA KILLINGBECK SCOTS&IRISH TO THE CORE"
3,The Best of Riverdance,I gave as a gift. The receiver said they enjoyed it. I purchased it at their request.
1,Not good,If you are looking for riverdance get the original one. Do not waste your money on this one.
3,its not the best,i dont think this is the best rever dance. for me i think the first show (micheal flately and jean batler) is the best. any way i like this show and i think im really lukky to have this dvd.
1,Winning the Battle?,"I found this book misleading, it makes the reader believe that Bipolar Disorder is easy to cure if you follow a few simple steps. For those of us, who have close relatives who suffer the disease and have to endure it, this book is an insult. Where is the maelstrom where the whole family is thrown during the manic pahses? Where is the dispair of the patient during the depressive periods? Where is the fight to convince the patient, who is either a god or scum, to seek help? There is nothing ""romantic"" in this illness, bad wheather brings depression, good whether brings mania, with short intervals in between. And the solution is not around the corner for everyone.This comment is also a criticism to the lack of responsibility of the editors, who chose to publish it."
2,pretty basic,"This is an educational book that provides the basic information of bipolar. It is very easy read. If you are knowledgeable of bipolar disorder, it isn't a book that you will gain much knowledge from. I wouldn't recommend it as their are numerous other books that cover this topic extensively."
3,book review,This book was a very interesting book. I thought it was really sad when Peter Lourie passed by the river side and there were little kids learning and it was their school. The children were sick and skinny. Peter Lourie explained that their parents were very poor and they didn't have any money to buy clothes or food. I thought it was really cool when they followed the guy that collected the latex. I thought it was interesting when he cut a V into the tree and the latex dripped into a cup. When I read that the gold was found in the river I thought how did the gold form. I don't know how it did but it was a pretty amazing thing. When Peter Lourie went to the Indians I thought it was really interesting the way they caught their fish they poisoned the water so the fish would go to shore and they would pick them up. If they were still able to move they would spear the fish. This book really taught me a lot I really consider you to read one of Peter Lourie's books!
3,"Retitled paperback version of ""I've Got Mine""","WALK INTO HELL is a retitled paperback reprint of Hubler's novel, I'VE GOT MINE. See my review of it under the latter title."

4,pleasant surprise,"some very strong tracks, worth buying. early mats sound, but i also here some cheap trick and other various influences. whos going to burn down the house, stay away, and crazy anymore burn.for a first release, it doesnt get much better than this and i highly recommend this cd for those who miss that 80's indy sound."
4,Don't listen to the snobs...,"This is a good, solid rock n'roll record.Came out around the arrival of the Strokes,so of course they were lumped in - but theyowe more to the Replacements than the VelvetUnderground. ""I Don't Wanna Be Crazy Anymore"",a terrific ode to Cheap Trick, is one of myfavorite songs of the last five years...- cRAIG"
4,"parental advisory, explicit content","now don't get me wrong. this is a band i love; but this album, their ""breakthrough""--the kind of album old-fashioned music snobs tend to elevate way, way above everything else the band ever does regardless of what it sounds like--i find more or less unlistenable. it basically takes traditional pop melodies and grinds them through feedback and distortion. and that's it. it was revolutionary at the time, and people had multiple orgasms over it, but i just don't like it very much. myself, i have multiple orgasms over their later work, thank you very much. the recent _21 singles_ comp is outstanding, and honestly, all the casual fan needs to buy."
2,hopeless but cutesy,"This was a very important record to young nerds who bought the NME and Melody Maker back in the day. This is supposed to be some sort of subversive stylistic endeavour, and maybe it is compared to your parents Supertramp records, but it's really about how cute young Jim looked in his black outfit. I trudged along in my black outfit to see them when they toured Oz in the early nineties and they did their bit by being hopeless musicians (like all touring English bands of the time, such as MBV) and storming off like spoilt brats after 30 minutes or so. It was a hell of a lot of fun I suppose, but not any more about making interesting music than Supertramp, for instance."
2,Outsiders View Inside,"heres 2 cents:I listened to 6-7 tracks from this band and i gotta say i would not get this CD, i think ""Black Rebel Motorcycle Club"" is way better than these guys despite having more or less cd's."
4,Needs to be remastered!,"This album is probably one of the greatest ever made. The only reason I gave it four stars is because the production (at least on my cd copy) is too quiet. These guys were known for being one of the loudest bands around. They caused riots back in the '80s, but the sound quality doesn't show it. If they ever get around to remastering this highly influential album, I'll be first in line to buy it. I had to pay extra just to buy it, as it's no longer availabe in the states. As for the music, it's incredible. Velvet Underground-esque pop songs laced with the raunchiest distortion and feedback you're ever likely to hear. These guys were 10 times wilder and noisier than their predecessors, the Velvet Underground."
3,"Amazing concept, poorly written.....","This approach outlined in this book is fantastic. My child has impulse control issues, and we were being subtly pushed by his psychologist to consider medication. In a search for something else to try, I found this book. Bottom line: the method works extremely well, but only if you can slog through the book and pluck the gems needed to make it work. The book wastes endless pages selling its method. Believe me, if you're buying a book with a title like ""Transforming the Difficult Child"", you don't really need a sales pitch. You'd probably dye your hair green if you thought that it would help your child.Actually, since the parents buying this type of book are probably at maximum stress level, the authors would do them the greatest favor by publishing this book as a stripped down how-to manual."
2,Surprised at the good reviews.,I bought this at Whole Foods hoping it would work. It doesn't. I can't even imagine how they can claim that it thickens anything. I have really fine hair and all it does is make my hair look greasy. I use a seriously tiny amount...barely visible on my fingers. It neither makes my hair look thicker nor holds any kind of shape at all. I guess I'm still on the lookout for a good natural thickener. It bums me out to throw it away but I guess I'm going to.
3,Contains Xanthin Gum,"Although the product ingredients don't say it on the website, this product contains Xanthin Gum. It still tastes good, I just wanted people to know. Xanthin Gum is a laxative, so... Well, you know."
2,cheap,I bought this because I didn't realize the landline phone I bought would come with one. It's cheap and it's very long..
4,Works Great,I travel often over seas and the got my system back on track.I wasn't thrilled that it was only half a does but I can understand the price point.
2,gross,"I guess it does the job but taking this stuff was like a pure form of torture. Basically a witch doctor of sorts told us we had a parasite and we should get this. So we took it for a couple weeks as directed, maybe a month, can't remember. It did the job. We definitely went to the bathroom, but when I went to my chiro, he tested me and said I didn't have one... SO, make sure you need this before taking it. It's not worth gagging 3 times a day."
4,Great Bike,"It's not a fancy bike, but it gets you around. A bit on the heavy side, and the frame may not fit everyone. I am 5' 4"" so it fits me decently. It would fit a man or a woman that is 5"" 7' perfectly."
5,Humididier,"Shipping was fast. If you are handy,the unit was easy to install and raise the humidity from 20% to 30% in about a week."
1,Cheap electronics make this a poor choice,"I bought this unit and installed it into the hole in the ducting that my Aprilaire unit was in. Installation was pretty straighforward but the instructions are confusing.The first unit stopped working after 30 minutes. I returned it and the second unit stopped working after three days. A little research online showed that the transformer inside this unit is defective and burns out easily. I opened it up and indeed the transformer was burnt out. Not wanting to return it yet again, I removed the circuit board and transformer from the old Aprilaire unit and plugged it into the Honeywell unit and now it is functioning. (Please do not try this if you aren't familiar with electrical wiring!)This product should really be recalled. Avoid at all costs. Honeywell should be ashamed to place such a product on the market especially since this problem has been known for years and they continue to ignore it."
5,Great tool for Musical Theatre Teachers!,"This documentary is a great tool for showing students the realistic side of musical theatre and how shows are created. It doesn't just show the ""glamour"" that many young students believe the theatre to be; it also shows the critical and stressful side of the theatre lifestyle and how competitive of an environment it is. My college level theatre students really enjoyed it!"
4,There's No Business Like it,"This is a very entertaining behind-the-scenes look at four Broadway musicals that opened the same season. If you love Broadway, you'll adore this film. If you don't there is still a lot of human interaction to engage you. It doesn't quite attain the magic of a real show but it points you in that direction."
4,Fun!,"I have wanted this for a long time, just didn't have the money. I finally got it and I am so glad I did. Although it is from a few years ago it was such a fun look behind the scenes, and a great look at how Wicked started out! I will watch it again and again and I definitely recommend it to Broadway and theater lovers!!"
5,Frusciante = Guitar God!,"John Frusciante is truly the greatest guitarist of our time. Though he doesn't flash off on his solo albums, he does write great songs with deep meaningful lyrics. This solo release is definitley the most melodic of the 4 he has released. He also experiments with sound that reminds me of the way Pink Floyd used to back in there Umma Gumma / Live at Pompeii days. I haven't listened to this album as much as To Record Water in Ten Days (one of my most favorite albums of all time), but I know it'll be in my CD player for at least a month straight. If you want to hear someone who plays with his soul and sounds like no one else - you have to check out John Frusciante and the Red Hot Chili Peppers. Thank you and I hope you enjoy this sound as much as I do."
2,Sorry guy but this isn't that great,"I Love John Frusciante, but i hate people who use their love for J.F. as an excuse to love all his music. this CD is disapointing, i really did think that it would be good. there are many problem with it:1)the drums sound like a metronome2)everything has been so overly produced and digitalized that for most of the songs you can barely hear the musicthis sound like something John Frusciante threw together late at night on his computer and decided to produce itthere are however 3 very good songs (but ONLY 3!) and they are1)Carvel2)Song To Sing When Im Lonly3)The Slaughter"
1,yawn..........,"The trouble is with artists like John Frusciante is that they have a very loyal, cult following. Fans who will support them no matter what. I think this is what is going on here judging by the ridiculously generous reviews........ I also consider myself to be a big Frusciante fan but I also like to remain objective about the way I view his output.I haven't been this dissapointed with an album for a long time. It contains mediocre, boring songs that drag on and on and on and on.........I think John has got lost somewhere along the way in his quest for artistic fulfillment and experimentation; resulting in an album which seems to be unremarkable, formulaic, banal and lacking the usual edge that is expected of his work.Worse than Coldplay."
5,One of his better efforts,"I found this one harder to put down than any Furst novel I've read, and I've read most of them. You're in for a treat. Enjoy."
3,Good but a bit long and some mistakes,"This is my first Alan Furst book. I the action and adventure were quite good, but it is a bit too protracted with new characters popping up all the time and quickly disappearing.My biggest problem is that, although it claims to be a researched book, there are many mistakes and inaccuracies. About half of the Slavic words and phrases which are frequently featured are mistranslated completely."
5,modern day heroes,"these are the modern day heroes, people that fight for something they believe in and its something other than money. true, there is a lot of controversy with what they do but considering their deep pocket extremely powerful opponents, sea shepaerd has to use all they have in their arsenal. i agree with their tactics even though pete berthune said some things about them. with such a powerful opponent, its like telling david that he cannot use any weapon against goliath except his fists. sorry, there are somethings said here that are not in season 2."
5,An excellent thriller,"Nobody has ever heard of Philpin but I rate him up there with Connelly, Patterson, and T. Jefferson. NONE of his books disappoint. Start at the first one and you'll read em all."
5,A real page turner,This one grabed me from the first capter. The format is very compeling and keeps you on the edge of your seat. The charicters are well developed and the suspens builds with each chapter.
4,Stellar,"This may not be Patti Smith's best album, but it is certainly my favorite. No Patti Smith collection is complete without a copy."
2,A painful read,"I found this book repetitious, wordy, and poorly written. Here's an example of what I mean: ""The concept of formulating and completing a diagnostic assessment is richly embedded in the history of mental health practice. Furthermore, for many practitioners, the desire to master this process has been emphasized by compelling demands to address practice reimbursement."" (p. 29) Fortunately, there are ""Quick Reference"" boxes that summarize the main points; I found that reading these summaries gave me almost as much useful information as slogging through the main text. If you *have* to read this book, I recommend utilizing these summary boxes. It's unfortunate the text is written so badly, because there is good information in here. I give it 2 stars because I think the topic is important, and the summary boxes make it less painful to get through."
2,Lame,"I was disappointed in this because I love Winsor Pilates. I was hoping for a good workout. After about 25 minutes in I finally stopped and watched the rest because it was so boring! I'm not a super athlete so it's not like I am already in such fantastic shape, but this was just a bunch of pacing back and forth and jumping. And the music was corny. For the 25 minutes I did, it felt like a warm up the whole way through. It picked up the pace a bit more after I stopped, but still the moves seemed all the same. You can get a much better workout with any low-impact aerobics class or DVD."
1,not so happy...,i have been a winsor pilates guru since before my teen years so when i came across this 'fat-burning' workout i was excited! i thought that it would add some versatility to my exercise routine but i didnt enjoy it from the first minute i started! i was so disappointed i didnt even try the 'maximum burn basics' workout...maybe its cuz im not the most choreographed person in the world but its not the moves but the pace that mari would go at...i feel that she doesnt give me enough time to transition into the next move and her explanation on how to carry out the next step is a bit lousy..i found myself just doing my own thing and dancing to the music! if you plan on getting it i hope you will have a better experience.
2,"Great Movie, but dubbing sucks!","This is one of the best Jet Li movies I have seen (and I have seen many). The problem is that it only has the English dubbed audio track. This dubbing sucks. I can't believe how much it ruins the movie just because of the audio. The action is fantastic but if you can't sit through the rest of the movie it makes it hard to get to those scenes. I can't believe that anyone would make a DVD with only one audio track (not the original) these days. How difficult could it be to include the Chinese/Japanese audio and some English subtitles. This may sound like I am just whining, but I am truely disappointed with this DVD just because of the dubbing."
4,Wonderful film - in Chinese,"This is my favourite Jet Li film - in the original language version. Unfortunately, Dimension has decided to provide only the English dubbed version on the DVD, which suffers from woefully bad voice acting; this unfortunately lowers the quality of the acting as well, which is *superb* in the original language version.With this in mind, I strongly recommend the original-language VHS version, and if you (like me) enjoy not seeing films ruined by some production house's dub-jobs, please join me in writing to Dimension for an original-language cut of this DVD. =)"
3,Disney do what you do best - ANIMATION,"To begin with, i just want to say that FOL is one the mostoutstanding movies ever to grace the movie industry - seriously, thisis one top action flick you just can't afford miss !Now then Disney (why did DISNEY out of [all the] publishers out there) have to publish this master piece? Could some one please give me more insight into this? I mean this is one (if not thee) the finest Jet Li movies, and yet it gets a crap release on DVD... I'm not even going to mention the dubbing & the special features - that's a joke in its own right.The only decent thing about the DVD is the picture quality, its nice and crisp - just goes to show Disney can do something right for a change!Please by all means go see this movie BUT make sure its in the original format it was meant to be seen i.e. no dubbing, with the original music - the movie will be enjoyed much more !"
3,"Great Jet Li movie, just HORRIBLE dubbing","This DVD has been slaughtered by extremely bad dubbing. The original VHS with subtitles is much better. This has some of the best fight scenes ever done, but's it's painful to watch the whole movie because the dubbed english voices are just plain horrible. I mean at the very least the producers of this DVD could have given a subtitle option."
5,outstanding film,This is absolutely one of my favorite martial arts movies. They respect the awesome responsibility of remaking a Bruce Lee film. First they expand upon the plot. The character development is better. The story has more substance and the pacing is more natural. Most importantly I think the fight scenes are incredible!Part of the reason they are so interesting is that each character has a cleary defined style and attitude. Beyond even that through each fight seems to have a theme. The first one for example displays a lot of grapiling (probably didn't spell that right) techniques. The ending was a little weak but didn't bother me.Finally I would have to say that Jet Li has an inner humility that makes him one of the few that can fill Bruce Lee's shoes respectably. Give it a shot it's cheap.
5,BEST JET LI MOVIE EVER!,"Better than tai chi master? Yes. This is BY FAR the best Jet Li and best martial arts movie I have ever seen. PERIOD COMMA END OF STORY! No movie has the realism and character development that this one has, not to mention the best fight scenes ever! A must buy!"
4,Great Movie on Blu-ray(don't know if it was NEW),"I ordered 7 Blu-ray Chinese cinema movies, this one seemed like it wasn't new, but used and re-shrikwrapped which I don't like. The disc seems fine, but it didn't have the typical sticker sealing it shut etc... just a mangled shrink wrap. Anyway i would expect more when Amazon is the seller/supplier. I'm watching it as i type, well it's not the greatest HD transfer, but i don't know what all goes into that... seems a bit grainy so far. The main thing is that i can now watch in with in Cantonese or Mandarin.4/5 stars for Blu-ray quality2/5 stars for Amazon sending me what appears to be a used copy."
5,Step aside Jackie Chan,This moving combines a great musical score and amazing fight scenes. I must say this may be better than Chinese Connection-the movie it was based on starring Bruce Lee. Be sure to pick this up along with OUATIC 2 and New Legend of Shaolin!
2,Not for mom's who know they want to wean...,"I bought this book looking for ideas on how to wean my son from breastfeeding. My son is 19 months. He loves breastfeeding, but I am ready to wean. I was hoping this book would provide examples and strategies on how to wean. It did not. This book is for the mom who wants to continue to breastfeed until her child weans naturally. It gives wonderful examples of families that have gone this route. But if you buy this book for the same reason I did, you will be very disappointed and frustrated as you get further into the book. The book seems to be written to encourage moms to breastfeed until their child weans naturally. It gives examples of other moms that have done it and explains why you should too. Not the book I thought it would be."
1,NOT about weaning at all,"I checked this book out from the library hoping it would provide pointers and support for weaning my 12-month-old daughter. After reading it, I left feeling guilty and selfish. This book is NOT about weaning. In fact, it is about why you shouldn't wean. This title is a diatribe listing every reason you should not wean your child and all the reasons you should feel like a terrible parent for wanting to. It even has the gall to suggest the desire to wean is simply a sign of other stress in one's life, a contention I find particularly condescending as an intelligent, concerned parent. It's too bad La Leche League, from whom I found wonderful support when establishing breastfeeding, can't get past its political motivation to help women move on to another stage in the mother-child relationship."
1,You get less than what you pay for.,"The old saying of ""you get what you pay for"" does not apply to this product because you get alot less then what you pay for. I purchased this item mainly because of its low price and the advertised ability to record to a cd as well as a dvd. First of all, you can't record from the HDD to a CD. Only a DVD. So if you wanted to record something from the HDD to a supervid cd, you cant. You can only copy from the HDD to a DVD. The remote is a joke. You can not watch a DVD or a HDD recording while recording or watching another. The DVD player is terrible. It locks up on me at least once a week. I have lost hours of recordings from the HDD because it locked up as I was editing it and wouldn't allow me to do anything but erase it. I do not recommend anyone to purchase this item at all. I am getting a different HDD/DVD recorder."
4,I PASSED!,"Well I passed the NCLEX. There were some nice test taking stratagies, and some good questions, but if you are already taking a NCLEX study course this is overkill (take that how you want)."
3,Posted description is hardly a description at all,"I have given this charm a rating of 3 stars for two reasons:1. The photo of the charm gives the buyer the impression that the charm is flat. The charm is in no way flat. It's more like a two/three-dimensional charm.2. The loop to place the charm on a necklace looks like it was sodered at a crooked angle. Also, the sodering spot has a gap in it that causes the loop not to be in a uniformed shape.In addition, the description doesn't mention the size of the charm. The size of the charm is as follows:Front, middle left point to middle right point: 13mm wideFront, top point to bottom angle: 11mm longFront, top point to bottom left point: 13mm longFront, top point to bottom right point: 13mm longFront, bottom left point to bottom right point: 8mm wideSide: 2mm wideLoop: roughly 6mm long and 4mm wideI'd like to also mention that the side of the charm (2mm wide) has a filigree-type design in it. The overall size reminds me of a round Advil tablet."
4,Dump cart,"Ordered this last month, it took awhile to get to me on the free shipping and there are some interesting ways they go about delivery. Don't ignore them when they call to make an appt. The cart itself is good quality for the money, although I ended up building a couple of struts so that the front support where the latch engages to give it a bit more integrity. It was flexing the whole bottom of the cart and didn't really want to latch. I just attached them to the front axle carrier bolts and drilled a couple holes in the verticle support for the latch. Made a huge difference."
2,If only I could use this trailer,"I ordered it a month ago, it arrived 3 weeks ago, and I still can't use it. After I assembled it (it did only take 30 minutes)it turned out that the latch mechanism that holds the dumping bed down won't latch. They were nice on the phone and sent me a new redesigned latch that still doesn't work. I have been waiting another 2 weeks since the last call for a new latch to show up. So, they have had my money for a month and I still can't use the cart. The other problem is that it has already started to rust. I'm beginning to wonder if I should have looked for something else."
5,Another great book by Traci Depree,"I was so happy to run across this book after reading Can of Peas. This was another heartwarming, refreashing story about ""real"" people.I can't wait to read another book by this author."
4,Torah Yoga,"This book blends two very different belief systems. I enjoy the commentary and also the link to Yoga poses. I am an ""old"" Torah studnet but new to Yoga. This is really a beneficial approach for me."
3,Average,"Hey,Well there's not to much to say about this one. Everyone compares it to Dante's Cove which i do love, But this is no where near. If you are buying this for a Dante's Cove type feel of a drama don't you will be disapointed tremendesly. Now for the good side it is still a guilty pleasure and has very good scenes in it. All in all it is ok and worth around the price its sold at."
5,Thank you.,"Everything great, Thank you. I will keep an eye out for other items you have for sale, Have a great new year."
4,entertaining!,"i watched the 1st season of the lair online a couple of years ago on youtube and thought to myself,""interesting!"""
2,Should be staked thru the heart,"I'm impressed and glad that they made an attempt to make a gay vampire series but sad to say its not that great. In fact, seen cheap porn with better acting. I couldnt even get thru the first series. So save your time."
2,"Bad script, nice body, not as good looking men as Dante Cove","nice nake men to watch, but the script, story is so badly writen. it looks like a B grade production. and the actors are not as cute as those you see in Dante Cove. Give it a miss! dont waste your time."
3,If you want to see good looking guys!,I would say that if you are looking for a story? this would not be your ideal DVD. But if you are looking for some great looking guys. VERY GOOD LOOKING GUYS! You should buy this.
2,Not what I expected,"I was disappointed. I had hoped this game would mean some of our son's computer time would teach him about the Bible and religion, but there's nothing really eduational or religion-oriented about this. It's just games, one of which is bumper cars (try to bump others) and one is target shooting, two activities that seem a little contrary to the morals I wanted encouraged. Also, the game is pretty short. It also requires a much better system than the minimum recommended - we have to play it on my computer instead of my son's. Still, it's fun to play and my son loves it."
3,Not His Best Album........,"Now I know that there are alot of Strait fans out there, me being one of them. I've been a fan of his since I was a kid.But this album here is not one of his best works. George is good when he is George Strait. But unfortunatly, the ""Nashville Scene"" might have enfluenced George a little bit. The album just doesn't sound like the G.S. stuff you are use to hearing.""If You Can Do Anything Else"", ""Don't Make Me Come Over There and Love You"", and ""Go On"" are about the only song's on this album that ""make it""."
2,Disappointing,"The best part of this book was the A&E video included. It was all quotes, and some not so positive. I did not feel that the author actually liked her. If you want to read it, check it out of the library."
1,"Wrong Part, Bad Customer Service","I ORDERED a LH (driver side) window regulator w/ motor for a 97 Honda accord. I RECEIVED a RH (passenger side) window regulator w/ motor. The company tried to make me pay for shipping to return the part, and only agreed to pay shipping when I refused. They then claimed it was in fact the correct part, which it obviously was not. I took several pictures of both the replacement and original parts, side by side, and the motor is on the wrong side of the device, meaning it is for the passenger side. The company then proceeded to give me a PARTIAL refund. After paying $76 dollars and wading through a sea of support personnel that speak broken english I received a $45 refund and am still without a driver side window. This was a terrible experience and I caution anyone against buying products from Auto Parts Train. Awful experience. Awful."
5,Whitney Houston,"Did you know that Whitney Houston's debut LP, called simply Whitney Houston, had four number one singles on it? Did you know that, Christy? It's hard to choose a favorite among so many great tracks. But ""The Greatest Love of All"" is one of the best, most powerful songs ever written; about self-preservation, dignity. Its universal message crosses all boundaries and instills one with the hope that it's not too late to better ourselves. Since, Elizabeth, it's impossible in this world we live in, to empathize with others. We can always empathize with ourselves. It's an important message. Crucial really, as beautifully stated on the album."
1,Not your fathers' Dead,"This is nothing like the classic dead you've heard about. Far from it. The sound is too polished. ""Alabama Get Away"" and ""Althea"" are okay but the rest is junk. I think most dead heads would agree that this is not the one to look for if you just want some of the Deads' best music. Really... The Grateful Dead with a polished sound?? Just doesn't seem to fit. Save your money for one of their greatest hits compilations,plus American Beauty, Worjing Man's Dead, Europe '72 and ""Dead Set""."
5,Venus in the Country,"When I read this book it was under the above cover, however, I found it to be a very good example of the victorian genre."
3,Cute but he doesn't do much. Daughter wasn't too excited.,"I read the most fabulous reviews on this toy. Thought it would make the ideal Christmas present for my daughter. I snagged it for $29, too. Even at that price, though, I wouldn't do it again. It doesn't do enough to really be entertaining. It's already sitting in the closet. Sigh."
4,The end of the world,"This book caught me off guard and I was suddenly transported to heaven and back to earth. The info on the anti-christ was fairly accurate biblically, but the troubles that Steve and his family went through were very believable. Steve's mother's faith in God helped to save the whole family as they watched bible prophescy unfold before their eyes. The ending was a bit much, but still the story was face paced and informative."
5,lego candy review,candy was shipped quickly to our home and was received with great anticipationby our grandson. He enjoyed using the lego-like candy blox to build walls andother inventions. Very realistic candy and much enjoyed to work with
5,Perfect for my son's cupcakes!,I ordered these to specifically put on top of my son's cupcakes for his 7th birthday. This came in pretty quickly and not one piece was broken. They are awesome and my son loves them....you can really build from it just like the real Lego pieces!
4,Tasted awful but the kids couldn't have cared less! LOL,"Bought this for my son's LEGO party and all the kids used the candy to build with. Very cute, we got lots of compliments!"
5,a big hit!,"Like so many other boys my son just had to have a Lego birthday party for his 6th. I first saw these candy at a hotel gift shop so I thought maybe I would find them here and sure enough here they are. They are amazing! We used them on top of cupcakes and we gave each kid a small bag of them to take home. They were such a big hit! You can actually build with them which is just so much fun and they are really yummy too! I highly recommend these candy. They also arrived it great shape and quickly, Thanks!"
1,JR,"The price was good, but considering the packaging, will not buy glass supplements over the internet. Figure it would be a great hassle to get it replaced. Complained, did receive an email they would replace it, but they did not have it in stock. That was over three weeks ago, still no product, very poooor packaging, cap broke, apparently they knew it as they placed it in a zip lock bag and the liquid caused damaged label on bottle. Concerned about sterility of product as one has to ingest it. Beware with glass product folks what you save you might lose in loss of product and time lost trying to correct it. Vendor did contact me via email as I did complain, said they would replace but were out of stock, three to four weeks later, still no product or update from vendor, and now Amazon asked me for a review. Don't they follow up on their vendor problems? I like Amazon but know I am leary about their standards with vendors in aspects such as packaging and follow up."
4,Phil Collins' finest moment as a Producer,"The CD release of this album has been an unaccountably long time coming. The re-working of ONE WORLD's 'Couldn't Love You More', with Eric Clapton's gorgeous guitar work and Collins (for once) sympathetic background vocals, is a masterpiece which didn't deserve to be hidden away in WEA's vaults for the past 15 years.As well as coaxing some of his best rock performances out of John Martyn, Phil Collins also provides excellent drumwork. Ace session keyboardsman Max Middleton is also at a near peak, doing much the same job on electric paino as he did for Jeff Beck's WIRED and BLOW BY BLOW, along with, in particular, Chris Rea's excellent ON THE BEACH.This is a great album, one that deserves to be played at volume!"
2,Very repetitive,"This album by Kenny is not a slow one (at least not entirely), and songs like Tribeca are great to liten to... once per month. Like most of his works, everything is repeated in his songs. Many times a broken record is less repetitive. That is the one flaw with his songs, that and the fact that the key never changes within one of his songs..."
3,hard on lower back,I purchased this stroller for my infant and 16 month old ( she has been walking since 10 months ). It is a great stroller overall but very long. I have chronic low back pain which is worsened because of the length (hard to maneuver). Great if not needing all terrain or a light stroller.
4,An excellent story!,"Almost 13 year old Maggie,full name Margret,goes to her Dad's cabin on the lake for part of the summer.She lives in Seattle with her Mom.Maggie goes down to the marsh everyday at dawn and sits on the same rock and watches the bird the Blue Heron.Maggie falls in love with the bird.She and the bird started having a good friendship until a boy named Tucker came along.The main character in this story is maggie.Maggies dad has a wife named Joanna.Joanna has a baby named Linda.Maggie also has an enemy named tucker.She doesn't like him for a certain reason. This is a good book for childre probably 7 and up.I liked it for all it's details and creativity.I like the adventure in it. Highly recommended for kids who like adventure,magic and birds."
5,A beautiful story!,Blue Heron is a beautiful story of otimism and hope that is sure to leave the reader smiling long after finishing the final chapter!
2,I'm not sure why I liked it...,"Kay Hooper's writing style is stilted, almost juvenile, but somehow the fairly simple plot kept me reading through to the end. This is the first book of hers that I read, and it interested me just enough to read ""After Caroline."" The style is the same (unfortunately), and the plot is what I now believe is the Kay Hooper Formula. I'm not sure I would call it a thriller, but both books do have eerie /moments/ that prickle the back of the neck. Perhaps that's why she rates with me at all."
3,It worked for me...,"I was ready to read a good book. As I looked at the stack of unreads, I chose Haunting Rachel, cautious because I couldn't get through Finding Laura.I enjoyed Haunting Rachel very much. I liked the twists and turns to make me doubt whether I figured out the storyline before I read the words. I didn't like the super natural stuff. It is not something that was easy for me to believe. The two of them having the same dreams. Not for me. I dream and boy I never get such messages. The flower there. The flower gone. Huh. BUT the author does a good job with the characters and hmmmm factors."
4,I must admit I was surprised,"This book was not what I thought it would be. I am not into paranormal stories so this was a great surprise. There were so many twists and turns that at times it got confusing but for the most part it was a solid story with some neat characters. Plenty of suspense, romance, and mystery. It was a entertaining way to spend a rainy weekend.Rachel has lost the love of her life in a plane crash and she has had a hard time moving on. In fact she really never moved on. She moved from home to the big and bright city of New York to further her career in fashion desgin. Tragedy again brings her home when her parents are killed in a plane crash and she is forced to face her past. While she is out and about in her home town she sees a man that looks exactly like her dead love and then accidents start happening to her. Who is the look alike and why are these accidents happening to her and will she ever be able to move on and find love. You have to read the book to find the answers."
2,Not her best,"Ms. Hooper does keep you guessing in the book, but it moves a little slow at times and the characters don't have much life in them. If you've not read any of Kay Hooper's books before, I'd suggest starting with one of the others."
2,"""Toonces and Friends"" Short On Toonces","Toonces and Friends is a big disappointment. I wandered why it wasn't available on DVD, it's because the entire program is only 24 minutes in length. That wouldn't be an issue if those 24 minutes were filled with Toonces sketches from SNL. However, Toonces is in only 3 of the 11 sketches on the videotape... what a waste! The remaining 8 sketches are comprised of material from the late 80's when SNL wasn't very funny.Toonces was in 10 Saturday Night Live episodes between May 20, 1989 - April 17. The videotape doesn't include 3 of the best Toonces sketches: Toonces & Martians w/ John Goodman, Driving Miss Daisy w/ Quincy Jones, and the funniest of all... Urban Toonces w/ Debra Winger. Don't buy this VHS unless you can get it for $5 or less."
5,Hillarious Video - also to clear up a few things...,"Not ALL of the sketches on this video were from Saturday Night Live. In fact, if I remember this correctly, this was actually a prime-time special which aired sometime in the early 90s. I can at least remember watching it on TV back then. These are all sketches by Jack Handy, and its actually mostly original material; maybe a couple or more of the Toonces sketches were actually from Saturday Night Live. So basically this video is a showcase of Jack Handy's humor.This video IS available in SP mode, I know because I own it. I don't know if this particular version of it listed on amazon.com is in SP or EP mode.Any comedy fan (not necessarly SNL fans) should check this out, There are some fantastic people in this from outside of SNL's cast: Bob Odenkirk (Mr. Show - was a writer for SNL at the time), Joe Flaherty (SCTV), Dave Foley (Kids in the Hall, Newsradio), and Kevin McDonald (Kids in the Hall) all appear in sketches on this video."
4,Very Solid Camera...definite value,"Let's put it this way...if this camera had ""canon,"" ""sony,"" or ""casio"" printed on it it would be selling for $250. This camera has a big LCD, very nice video recording, small compact size, and good photo quality."
2,painful to watch,Loved the first two but this one fell so short it hurt to watch. Did the directors change or writers? I couldn't even watch the entire movie. The humour was so lacking.Waste of 3bucks for sure
2,"after all this time,tucker is still annoying as hell !!!!!!","after the first 2,i decided to bring my walkman with me.when he starts talking,i put my cd player on full blast.there was no need to try and follow whatever ridiculous plot ratner was passing.it had to be one lame ''joke'' after another.a 6 year time out and this is the best they could do ?!?!?!?!?he better hope jackie chan lets him follow him to whatever movie he does next.the public has NOW certified this ''franchise'' DOA !!!!!!!"
5,Rush Hour,The movie is brand new. The movie came on time. This is one of my favorite movies and I am very happy to finally have it.
2,No Thanks!,"I wasn't feeling this movie. I never saw the other 2 Rush Hours, I'm sure they were better than this. I liked the ""Do Me Baby"" by prince sequence at the beginning of the movie, but that's about it! I like Chris Tucker in his other films like Friday and The 5th Element. Everybody's getting old and Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker should quit while they're ahead. I would not rent another Rush Hour, you can tell they've reached the end of the ropes with this series."
3,one too many,"I have always been a great Jackie Chan fan, and I liked the first two installments, but the third is a bridge too far. Plotwise it seemes to be a revised version of the first, which really lets you know beforehand when what is going to happen. Not a great trait. The action is of roughly the same caliber as its predecessors, although somehow a bit lacking. The jokes are funny enough though, but can't carry the film on their own.I think this film is a good example of the worse side of this hollywood obsession with sequels these days. Some times it just was not meant to be. 2,5 stars."
2,I come not to praise but to bury this sucker!,"Let's get one thng clear the plot is so thin that it only two plages long. You know who the bad guy is the second time you see him. The scene in th dojo with the BIG guy is totally not needed. The big song and dance number is totally not needed. Why didn't someone take a picture of the girl's head and give it to the cops? Think about this one.... The heros finally figure out who the bad guy is and over power him in his office. The second bad guy, the brother, calls and tells Jackie he has the girl and will trade the letter for her. Now the very next scene Jackie shows up at the killer's place with a girl, but the girl is Tucker in a wig. The big fight happens, which is copy of Rush Hour1 and Shanghi Knights. After the fight, Tucker and Jackie are confront by the head bad guy that they had over powered in the office. How did he get here? Whay wasn't he locked up? Who knows? Who cares? Even the out takes weren't funny!"
1,STAY AWAY FROM THIS DVD!!!,"I tried to play this DVD on three different PC's in Windows Vista Ultimate and Windows XP SP2.This DVD FAILED to play on any computer. It has ""enhanced content""... i.e. junk I do not need or wantEither this DVD was mastered poorly or perhaps it contains anti-copy measures. (Remember Sony's lovely rootkit?)Bottom line: I was ripped-off because I purchased a DVD that cannot be watched.Maybe this DVD will work on a stand alone DVD player. I do not have one.Maybe this is a good movie. I will never know."
2,NOT MADE IN AMERICA,I was looking for good quality toys made in America.As I read Melissa & Doug's 'about' page I got every impression they make their own toys to sell right here in America.When the item arrived it has a stamp on it `made in China'.Very disappointed. If you want made in America look elsewhere.
5,Great first vehicles for little one!,"I purchased these for our (almost) 10 month old son for his stocking. I was presently surprised when they arrived, much nicer than my expectations. They are very hefty (in a good way) I didn't think my son would really play with them much at first, but he loves rolling them back and forth on the floor. A special perk for parent's, no annoying twisty ties getting them out of the package. Over all, I think these will last for years to come, and will really grow with our son. I'm very pleased I went with these and not some of the plastic ones I was considering."
2,Judged this one wrong,"I bought this book for 3 grandsons (10, 12, 14) and thought they'd enjoy it as much as they have enjoyed all the TinTin comic reads. They gave it a quick look, then went right back to reading their TinTin books--with very little interest in the content of this book that does discuss the writing and characters of each TinTin book. I guess they were not interested on how it developed, just that it did develop. They read the TinTin books over and over--Maybe when they're older, this book will mean more to them, but not right now!"
3,"Ok, but BIG","Pretty nice charger, hoped it could be universal for all my usb devices but no such luck. Charges the Ipod just fine.Only downside is it is really big, much bigger than I expected."
4,Liebe (Love) ~ Ayla,"Liebe (Love)~ Ayla is a typical trance track and one would think that this would sound trite and boring. But not at all. Trance is without the best music to dance to and this track, i.e., Liebe with Ayla is no different. The 4 star mark is because I find the vocals to be a bit weak and some of the synth sounds are a bit questionable. Especially some of the drum sounds sound like they have been sampled with a quite cheap budget and the vocals sound weak. Even so 4 out of 5 is not bad."
4,The Brotherhood,Another cool release from Running Wild. Some really good cuts as usual from the band. Very high quality sound is my favorite as well. Starting out Welcome to Hell is a rocker and the jam for Siberian Winter is very cool! I think Detonator is my favorite song off the album....I just love the hell out of this song! I finish by saying it's a cool freaking album and I'm glad to add it to my Running Wild collection.
5,Black Cat Lore,"This has useful information on humanities superstitious stupidity regarding black cats, throughout history. As well as helping too build a more spiritual bond with any cat, while enhancing ones skill in the craft. The craft of utilizing the/a tool/s that were given to us by our spiritual (true) parents, Mother & father God, in order to enhance our own human lives/experience."
1,wrong songs!,"The playlist that you have listed does NOT match the one on the original album. I have been searching for this cd and thought I had found it, but nothing matches. The original album had - Ships, I made it through the Rain, read and 'em and weep, etc.... Your listing is wrong, please check into this, and I'll keep looking. Thanks."
5,War time experiences.,"I found this to be a delightful story ,set firstly in just pre-war England,about a group of cousins and how they interact with each other as the war begins. I wonder if the sexual licenses taken were really a reflection of how young people felt at that time--live for all your worth today for tomorrow we'll probably be dead-- or would it have happened an any case.You really come to grips with these characters as the book is written by a woman in her 70's who HAS lived and obviously knows what she's writing about. Great read and I'll be looking for more by Mary Wesley--a woman after ny own heart."
2,Not what expected...,"I am reading this book now and very disappointed. I am a complete novice on the topic and would like to know the basics of the kabbalah and how we can apply it in our life. Instead, the writers give complicated explanations on the multilayer processes and phases that are very hard to understand and not even talking about applying it to life...Instead of interpreting and give us basics of the teaching, they are providing the whole phase process without explaining the basics and what does it mean for us...I will be looking for another book instead, a simple version to understand the the actual ideas of the Kaballah that we can apply in our lives, not the multilayer phase process..."
5,Excellent,"If you are just getting started with Kabbalah, this book and anything by the Bergs is a must. They keep it simple and easy to understand."
5,Just read !,"Read this book if you are in search of the truth of our world and of this universe. Do you feel that you are destined to find the answer? If so, the information obtained from this book will point you in the right direction."
3,Charming Story - Quality not so good,"This is a charming folk tale with wonderful artwork. However, the book VERY oversized! The paper used for the pages and the cover is too thin for the weight of the book. The pages tore the very first time I read it to my grandson. Very disappointing."
1,Abridged! No where near as good as the classic!,"I purchased this board book for my 2-year-old daughter who had fallen in LOVE with my mother's 1966 paperback edition, in an interest to preserve its delicate pages.You can imagine my disappointment as I read it to her, discovering that important phrases, entire pages, and key details were left out of this edition, especially the rhythmic phrasing, and some of the low points of the book, completely flattening what had been a dynamic and suspenseful story. Even she noticed the difference and asked for the old book back.I would love to be able to get a new copy of the original story, however this is not it."
4,Mini opera story,"This is a fun book to listen to in the car, includes some funny singing. It evokes very rich images and my 4 year old loves it. My 60 year old dad and he had a great time playing up the songs!"
5,great book,Book has been around for a long time and till today is still one of every child's favorites.I highly recommend this book.
5,fascinating study of Ivanov and the Germans,A trenchant investigation of an essential subject. Rarely have I encountered such a profound treatment of this highly intriguing subject. The book is a must for anyone interested in German-Russian literary relations.
1,Hayduke's Revenge on YOU!,"A waste of time, a waste of money. This book, dated 1981 is so out-of-date as to be irrelevant. Typical chapters cover one and one-half pages; mostly of material sent in to Hayduke from contributors to his Paladin Press magazine columns. Most of that material so obviously points the ""mark"" in the direction of the perpurtrator (you) that retaliation is almost a certainty. I'll be reviewing the 1999 Hayduke book, but so far most of his stuff is a rehash of the magazine material and seriously lacking on high tech mayhem - which is ultimately so more deadly and anonymous."
4,"Strong lead song with Manchester, and wonderful instrumental","This CD is a tough find, from the 1978 movie, the strongest point of this one is Melissa Manchester's ""Ice Castles"" Theme. The other instrumental stuff is heavy, and very different. I love the bonus of Alan Parsons Project's ""Voyager"". All in all, this is a great soundtrack and I have never even seen the movie. It's worth it just for Melissa Manchester's song."
5,Everything I expected,"Smooth and easy from time of ordering to receiving product. Product was priced right, shipped quickly and expectations were met."
5,Great book,Great read.Surprising ending.Everyone should read this book and take charge of their own health.M
5,"the ultimate in fishing rods , a must have !","i owned a fenwick techna av when these rods first emerged on the walleye trail, since then i had one fling out of the boat , i thought fishing would never be the same, till now and at such a reduced price! with the same response and feel , this rod will allow you to feel evry little tap right in the palm of your hand ,the sensitivity will blow you away , you will feel every inhale of the fish as he every so gently tastes your bait,, the fish will hardly stand a chance , as this rod has so much back bone , you will literally rip the fish's lips right off! with this new techna, i am complete once again ,,, also i here the rumors that the techna line is possibly being discontinued aswell, , in regards to there un beatable warranty, i have heard and am only praying that they match this to whatever they at fenwick call there best one piece jigging rod! thanks!"
3,Was not indepth enough,"The Book has many strong points. It's easy to read, he's quick and to the point, it's layed out nicely and logically and you can tell he has background in information architecture as well as more technical areas in computer design (although he doesn't show them in the book). This is the first book that I've read on Information Architecture but it didn't seemed to be very indepth but was rather more dumbed down and collected a bunch of obvious facts and put them in one book. Much of the information I already knew and I'm a systems and multimedia developer for positive-edge.com, a web consultant and design company. I was hoping for a more throughal study in information architecture but rather I got the basic grounds as it relates to a project life cycle. It was a good book to get started and I suppose I'd recommend it to someone who's new to structuring web sites with a group of individuals."
2,Not what I expected,"It took me about 30 minutes to read through this book and glean whatever original material the author had to offer. The most useful bit of ""practical"" advice I found was to use post-it notes stuck inside of a manila folder for organizing web page topics. Somehow I expected more from a book with ""Information Architecture"" in the title. This is a light-weight book, possibly for someone who has had little or no exposure to the web. It is more about corporate project management than website structure. The architecture of the book itself is disorganized and confusing; it rambles for seven chapters on various disparate topics before launching into the purported subject of the book, and even then it amounts pretty much to restating fairly obvious, common-sense techniques."
1,Awful,"I wanted to find some quality Bicycle mini cards to do cardistry with my small hands. However, when they came, they weren't what I ordered. They were much smaller than described, had no finish, making them hard to use, and were printed on cheap, thin paper. They weren't even Bicycle brand as depicted. They were from some generic brand company. I wouldn't recommend these to anyone who likes things with quality or like getting the item they ordered. All in all, they were cheaply made, not the product shown, and highly overpriced. I was very disappointed."
2,Not Much To Write Home About,"I mainly bought this record because of the prescence of John Wetton, however I rarely listen to it. Only recently have I gained just a slight appreciation for the music of Family. To me they are just not an easy or very rewarding band to listen to. Roger Chapman may be the most annoying singer in the history of British rock. The songwriting isn't there and the arrangements are beyond clumsy. Family is for die hard 70's British rock fans only; and this is in my opinion the 2nd best album that I've heard by them. I would rate Fearless maybe a little higher.I just don't understand the appeal of this group."
3,"Has anyone ever seen ""MERCY""?","I paid $1.99 to watch the pilot of this show, and after watching that and reading reviews I am convinced that my favorite show, MERCY on Wednesday nights, is a much better show. Watch it, it is a great show! Great interpersonal struggles, great show, true to nurses."
4,Edie Falco is brilliant,"So much of this series rings true about working in a hospital, being part of the human race and the struggle to find peace in life."
4,Nurse Jackie is....,"Infectious.No spoilers here. Read on.While it is terrible to glamorize drug abuse and infidelity it can be entertaining. Just don't take it to heart and yourself act upon her indiscretions.She is a compassionate nurse giving to those who deserve that extra something special. Actually she gives something extra to those who deserve it in a wholly different way as well!Sweet revenge and just deserts.If you liked Edie Falco in The Sopranos you will probably like her more in Nurse Jackie. Her roll is obviously much more pivotal and sympathetic.Her husband is a doll putting up with her shenanigans though he, too has his own. And then some.Her best friend, a British doctor, is lovable and quite appealing to the eye. I think she is equally important in this series."
1,"Attempted watching the first couple of shows.......HORRIBLE, my god","This show is just plain dumb. Edie Falco is NOT an amazing actress. She was Carmela on the Sopranos, that's it."
5,great gift idea!,"I bought this as a gift for my Mom, and she loved it, she put in a request for 3 more!"
3,OK but nothing special,"Most of the songs on this album sound way too close to a cross between Bob Dylan's ""How Does It Feel?"" and Pink Floyd's ""Comfortably Numb"" for my liking. However, I really like the few that don't, such as the Neil Young-tinged ""Baby's Coming Home"". In general, I would have to say I enjoyed their previous album much more."
2,not too happy,I love this movie. I became excited when i ran across it and the price was wonderful. I played the movie and to my suprise it just cut off right before the ending. So i did not get to see all of the movie. Very disappointed. I threw away all of it's contents so i was unable to send it back for a replacement. Not too happy at all.Denise G.
4,Great powermetal,"This is absolutley EDGUYs best release since Vain Glory Opera. Great melodic songs from a band that is probably the closest you can get to the golden days of Helloween. Great tracks is Jerusalem, Pharao, Mandrake... A must buy!"
1,10 out of 12 units in our building have FAILED,"My wife and I live in a newly renovated condo building with all 12 apartments equipped with the Summit Washer and Dryer combo. So far this year 10 out of 12 units have failed. I'd rate this product ZERO out of five stars if Amazon let you submit a score that low.Buyer beware:1. The machine is LOUD.2. The machine is very slow.3. The capacity is tiny.4. It WILL break.5. When I dialed the first appliance repair company in the yellow pages, they instantly knew where I lived before I could even finish saying Summit Washer/ Dryer combo.Please, please consider other choices and save yourself the headaches!"
4,Sit back and enjoy,What a great book. The type of book you take on a vacation or sit in front of the fireplace on a cold and rainy night to browse and enjoy. The photographs are priceless.
2,The devil in the detail,I'd like to say that this is a good book for the general reader who wants a broad overview of networking protocols.But nobody buys a book like this for browsing and unfortunately it falls short when it comes to the nitty gritty details that anone working with these protocols needs.What is the point of providing extra detail if these details prove to be misleading or in some cases even contradictory?I know this looks like a frothing rant so I guess I need an example:page 389 in table 16.1 the DHCP Broadcast bit in the flags entry must be set if the client does not have an IP address.Then for the rest of the chapter all examples show the bit unset.I know its pedantic but these books are bought for detail like this.So in conclusion it may look good on the shelf but cannot be trusted for everyday use.
5,Still fresh and seminal,"I first got this as an album when it exploded out on the scene, and recently re-bought it as a CD. It holds up well, still haunting and enrapturing."
3,"Very good, but hard to start","This is a very good book, but the style is very different. It sounds a bit like Yoda the whole time. The story is about a 13 year old boy who has to leave his home in the country and go to the city to be an apprentice with the copper and brass master, Tang."
4,Good book as you slowly read it!,"This book is a great book. It at the beginning can be a littleboring, or if you pick it up after a long time it may be a little boring, but after you read it for a little while, it gets a lot better. I read this book, and it was great. The scenarios are real, and this book is really actionpacked. But,as I said it sometimes can be boring."
5,Useful text,"This book does offer specific projects and yet leaves an open-ended aspect for artist innovation and personal touch. There are a lot of methods explored and so this text is a great one in addition to the works of others in this genre. The greatest part about this book is that contemporary collage artists are featured and this gives the reader a connection with his/her peers. There is no ""art history"" and ""these are the famous collage artists"" feel to this book: it is 100% TODAY people who are creating collage art. This aspect makes the world of collage feel approachable and in the here and now."
3,MEMORY LAPSE,"I didn't know this was the first two episodes of a television series, but after watching it, I certainly can see that it was. The production values are okay, but I understand some of the footage of Mars was taken directly from the Schwarzenegger hit movie which spawned this series.Michael Easton, Nick Mancuso and Karl Pruner did commendable jobs in their roles, but the script was a little contrived and direction a little tepid for this kind of action film. Cynthia Preston is all but wasted in the typical wife who hates her husband's job and whose father was killed fifteen years earlier.Not an unenjoyable movie, just flat."
4,"Not what I expected, but kept me hooked","I loved the ""Book of Earth"" and its heroine so much and the wait was so long for No. 2, perhaps I set myself up for disappointment. I had trouble with the hero of ""Water"" -- he's a reluctant hero clear to the last page. To be fair, he's an honest character, a modern (2013) young man who has learned to survive in a failed world, who certainly isn't going to accept dragons and magic as readily as the tenth century heroine of the first book. Maybe it was the switch to present tense every time we go to his POV -- yeah, yeah, I know it's a technique to show his mindset, but it jarred me. And, darn it, I like medieval fantasy, and my favorite scenes were those that flashed back to Erde's home time. But, I gotta tell you, while it took me months to finish this book, it got me going at the end and now I'm waiting for No. 3. Heavy sigh. All in all, recommended."
5,"Book of Water(Dragon Quartet, Vol 2)","I received my book in very good shape and in a timely fashion.The book is very interesting so far. I had read the first Volume, The Book of Earth and liked it. The stories seem to run from one into the other. In the first book you get to meet Erde and Earth, the dragon. In the second book you meet N'doch and Water and get to see how they interact with each other and Erde and Earth. So far they are interesting and I like how the characters are being built."
4,IF You Haven't Heard this song your crazy!!,This song is amazing its really good and every true clubber must own this song. Or if your a DJ like me you definetly want this track spinning on your dual dennon decks. Look for the Junior Mix of this song its off the wall. Trust me you will like it. DJHike
2,Nikon 70-300mm f/4-5.6G AF Nikkor SLR Camera Lens DOES NOT WORK on D5000,"I bought it because it was less expensive than others.Unfortunately, the auto focus does not work on D5000 whichis highly annoying since the advertised product name includes AFin it.Also the image shown is not what was shipped.It has an extra 2 inch rotating black sleeve on the end of it."
1,THIS is NOT a AF lens,"I ordered this lens as any normal customer would. Read the fine print and thought man this is a GREAT deal. I received the lens prior to the estimated date. But when I went to use it, it was MANUAL focus, not AUTO focus as the seller is telling everyone. DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER!!!!!"
4,Great Nikkor Optics For the Price!,"This lens is a steal at this price. I have had mine for more than a week now and I can honestly say that it has exceeded my expectations.For only $140 I have a decent zoom lens for my D50. I love this product.Now, while the lens is great, it does have some problems. It is loud, heavy and slow to focus. This is not an ED (extra low dispersion) lens so some of your pictures may not be as sharp as they would be with your top-end kit lens. However, again, look at that price! Worth every penny in my humble opinion."
5,"Compatibility,","Please note this lens AutoFocus system is not compatible with NIKON D40, NIKON D60, NIKON D3000, and Nikon D5000.This lens will fit above models, the focus system will only work manually.This lens is Compatible with NIKON D50, NIKON D70, NIKON D80, NIKON D90, NIKON D200, NIKON D300. The Autofocus system will work on those models."
2,70 - 300 Nikon zoom,"I did not care for theNikon 70-300mm f/4-5.6G AF Nikkor SLR Camera Lens. The focus ring was at the end of the lens and didn't make for easy focusing with a moving subject. I returned it and got the Nikon 55 - 300 DX zoom lens. Although it cost a bit more, it was absolutely worth the price, no question. I LOVE the new lens. The return was hassle free and I received very good service from both providers."
1,wwe is a waste of time and money,do not buy wwe dvds they are boring lame and stupid and unintelligent wwe is lame and boring anyways buy something else instead
1,He said it all,"Ditto to tenorsaxman's fine comments. The essential problem is laziness and lack of education in the finer things. That's why Budweiser sells more than Heineken, hamburger more than filet mignon, and Kenny G more than Trane, Rollins, Shorter, etc."
4,"Fun & Hilarious, better with a group of people!","Game is great and lots of fun! Get creative with the clues and it can be rather hilarious!!!Better with a big group of people, 4 or more."
2,Bad party game,"Our game group usually ends a session with a light party game such as ""Say Anything"" or ""Wits and Wagers"". I bought ""What's Yours Like"" as something different in the same vein. Three times around the table and we put it away.Example: The clue is ""My Favorite Vacation"". Clues were ""Mine is tropical"" and ""Mine involved two people"". Eventually the guesser came up with ""holidays""? Well...not exactly.We wound up pulling out ""Apples to Apples"" which isn't a good game but is better than this one."
2,HUGE Hard to Swallow Pills,"I can't say how well these work, because it was a struggle to eat these 3 horse pills 2x a day. I am not a wussie either, I regularly eat a handful of pills in one swallow, but these are not only HUGE but the coating is bad. They will stick in your throat and no amount of water will get them down. That is taking them one at a time! They need to come up with a powder form or capsules. These tablets do not cut it and if you have problems swallowing pills, you will never be able to swallow these."
5,Magic in a Bottle,"After years of dealing with fibromyalgia and the associated body/joint aches and pains with minimal relief from prescription medications, I tried FibroResponse on a doctor's recommendation. Within three days, I felt better than I had felt in years. Now I have my husband using it (his sciatica pain is completely gone - something regular chiropractor visits nor NSAID's couldn't do), as well as a handful of friends. Everyone can't believe the relief that FibroResponse has provided. I honestly can't say exactly what ingredient is doing what but, overall, I feel 100x better than I did prior to using this product. I recommend it wholeheartedly to anyone who suffers fatigue, joint/body pain, or tiredness. It truly is magic in a bottle."
4,A compact book that packs in so much,"This is the first J M Coetzee book that I have read. Usually, with due respect to the committee and winners, Man Booker Prize books do not sit very well with me- save for a couple. This book is surprisingly, an exception.In a mere 200+ pages, Coetzee packs many important themes like aparthied, father-daughter relationship, when should a parent ""let go"" of his/her children, abandoning city life for a simple rural living, when is a child considered old enough to be held responsible for his wrongdoings, should one take revenge against an assault et al. Just far too many of them for me to list all here. There is an austerity about his prose which grips me. Recommended read."
3,Two dimensional,"Disgrace shows two-dimensional characters dealing with problems that deserve a much richer and more thoughtful treatment. The violence is abstract and seems to exist solely as a device to explore some of South Africa's larger problems. The novel opened in a very compelling way, but the moment Coetzee moved from Lurie's personal problems to the broader spectrum of concerns dealing with race and gender, his narrative lost steam and credibility. I was reminded of my response to Chang-Rae Lee's A Gesture Life--both are philosophical novels that fail to fully engage the reader in the main character's plight."
3,Life as is,"This stroy tells about life bare and naked. It is a story that shows the horrible price you can pay just learn a simple lesson...and at the end you find that there is no lesson to be learned...it is just life...it can crush you, burn you, destroy you inside out for no reason...or no apparent one at least...the only thing you learn is that at the end you must let go...you must go on...with hope or with out...beaucse you have no choice but to go on"
1,Not for everyone,"Yes, the book is beautifully written, but the subject matter is at best depressing: brutal rape, seemy sex, and bad family relationships. The characters are unlikable, and their realtionships frustratingly strained. There is nothing redeeming in this novel. One look at the number or used copies available will tell you that this book is very hard to love. As a Booker prize winner, this was a BIG disappointment."
5,A Brilliant Coetzee Read,"""Waiting for the Barbarians"" and ""Life and Times of Michael K"" might be Coetzee's best books, but this is surely up there as well. ""Disgrace"" is a dark book about the state of man and the state of a country. At times painful, it is never dull and always forces a reader to think."
3,Disgrace or Despair?,"An extremely tightly written novel that should be read but definitely not a ""comfort"" novel. The portrayal of the black South Africans is chilling. Professor Lurie's love for his daughter shines throughout the book but he can't seem to come to the realization that he has seduced another father's much-loved daughter. There is much to discuss here and this is an excellent choice for a book group. Not everyone will enjoy it but each will have an opinion."
4,lean and mean,"This is the first book I've read by Coetzee, but I can definitely see why he's considered a great writer. At first, his writing seems almost plain, but then you start to read into the silences and the gaps and understand that his art is to say so much more (or even to imply so much more) than the words themselves can. He reminds me of Hemingway a little, in that many think that he's a simple writer although in fact he's very cerebral and complex. Lurie is not an enjoyable character, but you will feel his pain. For me, this book was a real discovery and sent me on the path to read Michael K."
4,South Africa - what a nice place to stay,"The novel ""Disgrace"" by J.M.Coetzee is set in South Africa. It is about the fall of David Lurie, a university professor,who fell for and then fell because of his sinful conduct to women. ""Disgrace"" deals with life in the time after apartheid, the conflict between black and white, between guilt and responsibility. It is also about the conflict between the sexes and asks implictly the question if a peaceful communication between the sexes is possible."
4,Living life on the edge,"J.M Coetzee's novel, Disgrace, tells the story of slow disintegration of Professor David Lurie. As a character, I found Lurie intensly dislikable -- selfish, ineffectual and in many ways somewhat inaccessible to the reader. But nonetheless I enjoyed the book. Coetzee's minimalist writing is in a similar vein to that of Hemmingway or Richard Ford. And his depiction of the changing South African society is both disturbing and fascinating."
2,Disappointingly simplistic work from a master writer,"I think Coetzee is a brilliant writer and Michael K is an astonishing book but few books have ever disappointed me as much as this one. As an allegory of post apartheid South Africa this book is a nasty mess. It is not reasonable to ask Coetzee to present an optimistic or hopeful vision but for readers who don't know South Africa and cannot put this book's racial politics into some kind of context, this will only reinforce the sense that the new government/social order is no better than the old one--just new masters exacting revenge from the old ones in the most sickening ways. In spite of all the real problems that South Africa has, that is not a fair conclusion. If you find this book compelling, ask yourself why that is. Does it provide a comforting sort of message that everyone is racist and that only animals really deserve our love and concern?"
4,An amazing character study,"An English professor in Cape Town, twice divorced, having enjoyed liaisons with prostitutes, is forced to resign from his post after his relationship with a student is exposed. He moves out to the country with his daughter and in doing so, finds a different rhythm of life to settle down to. However, a terrifying incident soon changes their lives.It's a wonderful, sobering and disquieting study of South Africa post-apartheid. The evolving relationships between David Lurie, the professor and his daughter before and after the incident, between Lurie and his student, between Lurie and Bev, the woman he helps out at the animal shelter, between Lurie and Petrus, and between Petrus and Lurie's daughter, Lucy, make for fascinating studies. What's most interesting is the change in Lurie himself and how he goes from being a pretty self-centered individual to one who starts to put the needs of others before his."
1,Awful ridiculous and even embarrising,Marlon Brando is terrible. He makes me sick when I watch his late work. He has descraced himself so much I don't know what else to say about him except for he's a awful human being.
3,Historical Accuracy,"This film was heavily criticised by leading reviewers. As a teacher I have used this film with students as a surprisingly accurate account. I accept that some performances are terrible (Brando) and the direction is pedestrian, but for historical accuracy it can hardly be criticised, and it's undoubtedly a fun, swashbuckling movie that can pass a wet Sunday afternoon and entertain all ages. Buy it or view it; just don't expect too much."
5,Ranchers plucked again,"Anyone who eats chicken needs to read this book. Sylvia does a great job in explaining the plight of the chicken rancher in a fictional form. But don't take the fiction classification to heart, this stuff really happens out there. If enough people read this book and tell their friends about it, maybe something can be done help these ranchers, most of whom are Mom and Pop farms just trying to make a living. Next time you have you favorite chicken dish or drive by a KFC, think about the ranchers that literally put their lives on the line for you to have a meal today."
2,Made my skin dry and crusty,"Seems like other reviewers were mostly positive, but after using this product for about a week, my skin started getting dry and crusty. It may be that if I stick with it, this phase will pass, but right now I'm not happy. I've quite using it for now because I have some photographs next week and I don't want to look dryer than usual. I started with dry skin, and now my wrinkles look deeper. The smell, however, I found to be quite pleasant and fruity!"
1,Did not hold up!,I needed heavy duty cords that would maintain their original shape. The phone cords are twisted and stretched out. I was hoping for better quality.
1,DOES NOT WORK WITH PANASONIC TELEPHONES,"This is a standard quality headset cord that works well except that it does not work with Panasonic phones. I tried this on 3 different Panasonic phone models and could hear, but not talk. Other branded phones work fine and I would have given this a 5-star rating if I had a different brand phone. According to articles I read, the cords should be wired as cross-over cables which is how the cable that came with the Panasonic phone is wired, but the GE cable is wired straight across. You can verify how the cable is constructed by looking for the color coded wires through the transparent connector body. A cross-over cable will have the BLACK wire on the left most pin at one end and at the right most pin at the other end with the other colored wires like-wise crossed.Amazon-You need to put this disclaimer in the product description - ""DOES NOT WORK WITH PANASONIC TELEPHONES""."
5,phillyville,"JUST HAPPENED TO PICK UP THIS CD FOR $... SOUTHPAW ROCKS,THE SONGS CHRISTMAS & HOLY WATER ARE AWESOME, CHECK THIS GROUP OUT IF YOU LIKE TO ROCK HARD."
2,"Slightly out of date, same information as usual guide books","I expected more from this book than lists of apartment brokers. The first 19 pages have some useful information with the exception of a slightly misleading table of Paris arrondissements on page 11. The rest of the book consists in lists of tours, stores, cafes, etc that most good guide books cover. I didn't check all of the lists, but the book mentioned Felix Potin as a local supermarket chain. When I was last in Paris in 1998 Felix Potin had closed all of its stores in Paris. Since this book was published in 1999, I would carefully check any information before depending on its accuracy. I purchased this book in hopes of finding detailed information on dealing with long term apartment rentals in Paris and was disappointed."
3,NOT baloney,"Sanders' first book on the TWA800 disaster was excellent, but the purpose of this note is not a review of his current book per se, but an urging of anyone who is seriously interested in learning the true facts about TWA800 to review Michael Hull's exhaustive and provocative analysis on the subject. Unless one examines the Hull thread, judgment against a missile related event as the cause of this disaster should really be reserved. The fact is, no sane and careful analysis of Hull, or of the event itself can logically lead to any conclusion BUT that an exegenous event was the absolute cause of TWA800."
5,Very Instructional,Loved the step by step project instructions and the photos of beautiful tiles. Should be in every ones hand building resources.
3,Jungle Fever,"I guess it was okay, but definitely not ground-breaking when you consider ""Guess Who's Coming to Dinner?"" Maybe it was just meant to be a different perspective and updated for the 90's."
4,I love this movie.,Shows the importance of love being color blind. It helps open the eyes of people and society.
5,Fantastic,I have been using this for long enough to know how well it is put together. Sometimes I don't need the 4x24. This is great for vertical and overhead work. It is very light. Tracking is spot on after you set it. Collects a high percentage of dust too. I would definately buy again.
2,Belts too weak,"I've had a couple of these units, and both of them had the belt break after six to eight months of use. You can get a new belt for twelve bucks, and it isn't hard to put in, but after a couple belts you get frustrated and annoyed. Spend the bucks for a better quality unit."
1,Don't believe every book you read.,"Especially this one, at least about the Philadelphia Experiment and Al Bielek . The center of the earth is NOT hollow, that is insane to think that people or demons dwell there. However if you want to find out what is up with the Philadelphia experiment, look here: http://www.bielek-debunked.com/Statements.html"
5,Outstanding,"Their are 2 downsides to this bino.Not waterproof, if that is a factor for you.Some users report the ""rolling ball"" visual effect when panning. (not for me though).Other than that they may be the best bino optically speaking, on the market. At the time of this review and for their aperture class; they optically out-perform any other porroprism design, and are optically matched by a one or two of the roof designs costing above $2200 USD.A well made porroprism bino such as this one will out-perform most roof designs due to much of the expense in the roof design, apart from hopefully superior sealing/waterproofing, goes into overcoming the losses resulting from the higher number of reflective surfaces in the roof design.Serious review: [...]"
4,"Very good DC movie, poor Animation","I enjoyed it, but WB DC could have let someone else done the animation work. The animation looked like it was done by the same animator of the Christmas Classics cartoons of frosty the Snow man, Twas the Night Before Christmas."
2,Good Script; Poor Animation,"Surprisingly, an intelligent & creative storyline but with typical Japanese animé style animation for the masses, e.g. chimney smoke in the background was a non-moving backdrop as were all the background scenes - not moving; not real; 2D flat with no depth; unchanging and therefore just plain cheap. Too bad, with better quality animation this had the potential to be a pretty good animated movie for all ages."
4,"Same as the others. Good movie, disappointing animation.","I watched this last night. I wouldn't say that the animation was terrible, and I definitely still recommend this movie. It was a good story and the voice acting quality was fine. It really is just disappointing that the animation wasn't up to the level we've come to expect. Some shots of faces and reactions are almost laughable at times which really takes away from the immersion. Still worth a watch though, and maybe even a purchase."
3,"Good story, interesting characters but HATE ultraviolet!","Just watched this and enjoyed the story in spite of some pretty mediocre animation. If you are familiar with the original comic, it is pretty true to that story line. I would give it a 4 out of 5 stars. But the blu-ray loses another star because instead of a digital copy, they 'allow' you to access an ultra-violet version. For someone who watches his digital copies on his Ipad, this does not work unless you are by a good wi-fi source. IMHO, this will effect sales...and it should."
5,"Excellent Movie, with a great topic for discussion.","This is a great story for those fans that wish to understand the way Superman operates.It would be so simple for him to kill his enemies and being done with it (like so many other so called 'heros' and 'heroines').I recommend this story to all Superman fans, although I would be careful in showing it to small kids, as some scenes are very strong for an infant to process.Have fun!"
1,A million little pieces of....,"Shields has been outed as a phony. I became interested in his work after reading an interview with Henry Rollins (who publishes Shields's books) that mentioned Shields being a former SEAL who went on missions of the ""darkest horror"" in Vietnam, like decapitating entire villages and putting their heads on pikes. Then I found out Shields was a fraud. Somebody should put his head on a pike, and maybe Rollins's too for not vetting the guy before agreeing to publish his nonsense. Lying about having served is bad enough, but fabricating atrocities like the aforementioned is just appalling. And no, he's not a great writer. Once his work has been stripped of its reality, it's pure junk."
2,"This is The Bottom, not The Top!","I simply cannot understand why all this album was recorded with sample keyboards, making sound of false violins. Pure disaster.Certainly the most disappointing album by Ms. Warwick. Not even the great Cole Porter save the disc. One may say she is great as always, I cannot disagree.Maybe the budget was small and so the producers gave birth to this completely neglectable album."
3,This CD is still in print!,"BMG/Sony still has prints of this bright Warwick session produced by the late Arif Mardin. Warwick fans in England and Japan bought it. I mostly liked ""Begin The Beguine"" and ""Night and Day"" when I first heard this CD back in 1990. A great concept album that should have done better in the States if given a solid promotional push."
3,Only OK for using on painted surfaces,"This roll of tape arrived just as I was painting our living room. I taped all along the baseboards (which had been painted a few months ago) before I painted the walls. The tape was only OK. It didn't take the paint off the walls, but it did take paint off the baseboards. Now I have to go over the baseboards again. The tape worked best in places where we had patched and sanded plaster and plaster dust kept the tape from fully sticking. Even though it has a lighter adhesive than regular masking tape, it still added a step to my painting job."
4,Works fine for me,"I find that this tape works fine on both painted and ceramic surfaces, so I would anticipate no problem on glass. I note that a review says there's a problem with the tearing of the tape. I found no tearing problem with my use. It tears easily across. It also removes very easily and I consider that a benefit"
3,"Gentle Adhesive, Otherwise Fine","Length:: 0:29 MinsNeed a mild-mannered adhesive on your tape? This would be good. Otherwise, consider regular 3MScotchBlue Painter's Tape 2090.If you're using it to hang large sheets of polyethylene, the grip of this tape will disappoint.I tested for clean-edge with spray paint on a piece of painted semi-smooth (somewhat grainy) plywood. It sealed fine...same as 3M #2090 ""original"" and #2093 ""advanced"".It's a darker blue than 3M tape. Not good if you use it to label stuff.- - - Pricing - - -Price is bouncy on amazon. You can save money by catching it at low tide...around 7.50. There's an ""Online Price Alert"" that will email you whenever this or any amazon product dips below your target price. Google it. It's nicely done. Or try camelcamelcamel."
5,Excellent performance,"I received this tape just as I was about to paint a kitchen backsplash. I ran strips along the ledge of the countertop. Adherence was great, even though there was probably a bit of drywall dust and maybe some greasy residue on the ledge surface. Then, purely for a test, I adhered the tape to some newly painted drywall after the paint had dried for about 10 hours. I used a painter's tool to seal the edge, painted over with another color and waited about 30 minutes. When I took off the tape, I was left with a nice, clean line that would be more than acceptable for most applications. The tape did not pull off the original paint, even though it was fairly fresh.This tape is flexible and easy to use, and the really wide width can come in handy for some applications. A winner."
4,Works well,I am very handy around the house I make lots of wood items and I do sometimes dabble in crafty things.I had to paint something the other day and grabbed this tape. It worked quite well. It smoothed out nicely and when I painted it didn't seem to leak through.I then tried it on a glass that I was going to dip and there I was able to see that the tape held the glue from seeping underneath. When my item was dry the tape pulled if very easily and left no marks.I find this is a nice item and worked well for the few things I used it for so far.
5,An excellent poetic venture,"I first saw the name Alazka on a poetry web-site, it was his poem ""Doggie Bag."" I was immediately drawn in to it's strange, unique style. It is somehow optimistically melancholy. I found it so intriguing that I searched for more of his work, and ended up ordering this book. I was not at all disappointed. His work covers a huge variety of ideas and styles. Gives something to poetry that it is often lacking. It is more than rhyme and rhythm, it is more than style, theme or originality. It's something you have to read."
4,Very interesting,"As a German this interested me a lot, because it tells you straightly what really happened in the legendary 1968. You've heard from so much, but this one really shows what happened. It's well written and has nice photos. I felt as if I had learned something after I've read it.For all those post-revolutionaries who celebrate their idols: before you do this get to know what they did."
1,Garage-Toys/My patient education (STAY AWAY),Cancelled my order.I recommend buying your product from another of Amazons connections.Garage-Toys/MyPatient Education does not seem reliable.
4,Made her big.

4,Not for the novice.,"Kuhn provides an in-depth, scholarly, philosophical dissertation on the causes, process and results of paradigm shifts within the scientific community. Much of the text, however, is applicable to other fields of study where paradigm shifts are concerned. While originally written for the scientific community, it has found wide acceptance in the social sciences. Kuhn, while not for the faint of heart, offers rare gems for those willing and able to mine them."
5,A timeless classic!,"Although written in 1962, this book is as valid now as ever, perhaps more so. Right now we are witnessing a paradigm shift. Move over Big Bang, Dark Matter, Dark Energy, and mathematical anbstraction in general, and say hello to Plasma Cosmology and The Electric Universe!"
3,"Thomas, he walks on water","After reading this important but extremely dense difficult book, read the reviews.Then get yourself a copy of the film ""Being There"".As Chauncey Gardiner said:""First comes spring and summer, but then we have fall and winter. And then we get spring and summer again.- On looking out a car window: ""This is just like television, only you can see much further.""- On planting seeds: ""Spring is the time for planting.""- On economics (actually on gardening): ""In a garden, growth has its season...as long as the roots are not severed, all is well, and all will be well in the garden.""- On death: ""I've seen this before. It happens to old people.""At the end of the film: Chancey walks on water."
1,Insightful Book but its Physical Quality Poor,"This is difficult to rate as the book is a revolutionary way to look at science and its evolution. However my gripe is with the physical construction of the book. I bought it new and It arrived with the front and back covers curving outward and the plastic coating already delaminating from the paper cover. As i started reading the book started to fall apart and by section four the binding holding the previous three sections failed and I had hole sections and pages falling out of the book. I don't know who is to blame for this. I have contacted the publisher, University of Chicago Press with my complaint but as I figured they are too big to worry about one persons experience. If i were them I would be extremely embarrassed about having my name on poor quality like this. I would return it but i have already made notes in it which i need. So it looks like I am stuck with an inferior constructed book."
5,Thoughtful but parses like mental molasses,"I agree with reader #2: this text is difficult to assimilate. Kuhn writes terribly (long, convoluted sentances). Is it worthwhile? Probably. The material presented by Kuhn might best be contrasted with George Basalla's book THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNOLOGY."
4,As a big Dean Martin fan I enjoyed this book tremendously.,"As a big Dean Martin fan I found this book to be thoroughly enjoyable. It gives in-depth review of all of Dean's movies. The book also offers good insight on what was going on in Dean's personal life. The author denounces some frequently cited anecdotes and accusations about Dean and gives thoughtful explanations to support his statements. The author either interviewed people close to Dean or referenced interviews done by others. I wish he would have spent as much time detailing Dean's recording career as he did his films, but then the book would have been three times as big as it is. One thing I find odd about the discography that the author offers is that he doesn't consider ""Everybody Loves Somebody"" as one of Dean's ""greatest songs"". I found this book tremendously enjoyable and I think that any fan of Dean, Jerry, The Rat Pack or just someone who longs for the days before political correctness will enjoy."
3,Save your money. Not a winner,"I was nicer in my previous review. Ok, I really got nothing from this book. It was really fragmented, not well organized, and didn't cover differential impedances. It just kept saying - you really need a software field solver. Well, I can't afford Ansoft, so this book has neither the math or the down to earth info that I need."
3,Delightful,"Amanda Quick's books have a relative touch of innocence and fairy tale as compared to other romance stories. This has been a delightful read, sweet and charming but not too spellbinding. The theme of legends from the exotic regions sort of set the backdrop of the story in a surreal and fantasy atmosphere. So it almost reads like a fairy tale. As usual, the lady is smart but innocent and able to see beyond the facade of her man. The plot twists are not dramatic or suspenseful enough, too mild that they did not tingle much excitement from the reader."
4,Very enjoyable summer read,"I have read almost every novel Amanda Quick has ever written. In my opinion, Deception by Amanda is definitely a winner. The story is romantic, and tender, while at the same time exciting. Also, the story is complex, and satisfyingly. I love it when she writes about a strong woman character. Inspiring, and a very enjoyable summer reading"
5,"Easy to read, funny","This is my first Amanda Quick book and I really enjoyed it. It was different than most other romance novels that I have read. It was funny, easy to read, happy and even had some surprises. I will look for more of her books."
1,"May be OK for boys under 12, but...","I have never been a fan of Cussler, but I have read several because a friend keeps forcing them on me and I'm too cheap to go out and buy a good book. This book was given to me in its unabridged audio version, and I now believe that you get a different perspective by listening, rather than reading, this man's books. It now seems obvious to me that he he leads (how shall I put this without upsetting the younger readers), an 'alternative lifestyle' that lets him see men from a position outside the norm. His descriptions of Pitt; piercing eyes, broad shoulders, animal grace, etc., etc. are all things that you might hear on Castro Street in San Francisco. He may want to start writing gourmet cookbooks, travelogue brochures, and/or style and wardrobe articles. He appears to know more about all of these things than he does about the relationships between men and women. I think from now on I will just tell my friend to give his books to someone else."
2,trash popular novel,This book seems to be one of the worse popular trash novelsI've read.1) it states there are archeology plundering international companies run by hereditary wealth/ aristocrats2) that the Chachapoyans were blond blue eyed giants of near 7 feet tall3) that there are tremendous unknown Inca gold in large secret hiding placesAll or at least most of these are pretty probably false.Some of the stuff about Dirk Pitt and affair with a congress woman and his collection of antique cars is just wishful thinking... ?Just very bad writing on top of lies of the worst sort?
1,Hmmm... I think I already read this one...,"No wait, that was just one of Cusslers' other books. After reading two or three of his books, Cussler's plots are easily predicted. Suken ship/ airplane, classic car, beautiful woman, ect. This book did little more than seal the coffin of my interest in his books. Thus is the fate of books written solely to make money..."
5,Great adventure !,As allways Cussler mix fact and fiction and as allways he got an entertaining and facinating result. Incagold is Cussler at his very best
4,Poppy,"I think the book, Poppy, is a great book with a good plot. The book is mostly based on Poppy, a mouse who lives in Dimwood Forest, getting revenge for her deceased fiance, Ragweed. The ruler of Dimwood Forest is a devilish great horned owl named Mr. Ocax. He supposedly protects them from porcipines and other dangerous animals. (But the truth is he is only protecting himself.) Mr. Ocax uses this lie to trick the mice to coming to his house for permission so he can eat them.I would give this book five stars, but in the beginning Ragweed, a country mouse then a city mouse, gets eaten my Mr. Ocax. (I didn't like that part.) I also did not like the ending because it should belong in the next book Poppy and Rye.New characters are introduced into this book, like Ereth. Ereth is a vegetarian porcipine. Ereth is the first clue for Poppy that Mr. Ocax is not protecting the mice.I did enjoy this book very much and I suggest everybody reads it."
3,This book is something for boys.,"The title of this book is Poppy. The author of this book is Avi. This book is about a owl named Mr. Ocax and a mouse named Poppy . Close to the end of Dimwood forest was a old tree covered by the moon . That tree belonged to Mr..Ocax who looked like death. He would survey the land and call it his own, watching for small animals he called his prey. I really enjoyed this story because it's very adventurous and a little life threatening because Mr.. Ocax kept trying to eat Poppy ,but poppy kept escaping him. The ending of this story is the best part because that's when Mr.. Ocax dies from fighting Poppy ,Mr.. Ocax took off and got a quill stuck in his talon . I would give this story 3 stars . It was horrible because some parts were weird , like when Mr.. Ocax ate Ragweed . I say it was weird and horrible because how he swooped up him up then regurgitated him. I would recommend this book to boys who like mice and owls."
2,It might just be the audiobook...,"But I'm feeling NO emotion from this. The narrator just makes it boring. Even so I thought I should feel something for the poor mouse, after all her boyfriend died. Honestly though? I hated Ragweed. I guess he was supposed to sound cool? It was just, for lack of a better word, stupid.I can't attach myself to any of the characters, I hate them all.The 'action' is bland, too.Avi does have a book or two that are worth while, just not this one."
5,POPPY!,"You are going to LOVE this book! It all happened when my teacher began to read it and it caught my eye and I started listening. Now I'm hooked! It is beautifully written by Avi. It is about a little mouse who adventures out into Dimwood forest. It held me in suspense. That's why it is a really good book. My favorite character is Poppy because she loves to dance like me! Its great for fourth graders, I know this because I am one! Happy reading!"
4,Review about Poppy,"This is a great book for third and fourth graders. I read it and thought it was very good. It is about a mouse named Poppy. Poppy's family doesn't have enough food so they ask the ruler of the mice, Mr.Ocax, for permission to move to a place that has more food. He says no. Poppy knows her family will die if someone does not move them, so she goes on a daring adventure to find out how to move them. This book has a great ending, so I will not give it away. I hope you read Poppy because it is a great book!"
4,Cool late 80's sound with a hint of the 90's,"As I've been stuck in an 80's phase the past couple of years cuz modern music has gone downhill, I've been trying to add more 80's bands to my collection, & this cd was a nice addition. I first heard ""Under the Milkyway"" a few years ago & was instantly hooked, & then heard a clip of ""Reptile"" a few months ago & just had to get the cd. I was expecting something mellow, & was not surprised with the results. Although this is nothing for the metal/industrial or poppy music fiends, it's certainly something for the listeners with mood changes, like myself, who need something to just chill to. Very reminiscent to me of bands like Echo & the Bunnymen & The Jesus & Mary Chain. Also, it may be just me, but see if you see the resemblance to the beginning of ""North, South, East & West"" to Hole's ""Malibu"" (even though I hate that Hole song)"
5,starfish,"the church starfish was a miss by gone affair of the heart. I first hear it was more than 20 years ago in a west coast city. band come and go. all the time. I didn'tlike it at first.Because didn't listen, I listen thing fall into place. Relationshipsfriends and places.I wish they wrote ""It time is over now,the dream is gone....""(Roger Waters)from The Wall. screw-it! that time and place. WAS Choices!lost,spark,antenna,reptile, blood money,under the milky way. Aussie national anthem.It wasn't a hotel womb It was apartment, where the real destination happen.spark"
4,I keep coming back to this one,"I remember those days in the late 80's when ""Reptile"" and ""Under the Milky Way"" played on the radio. I was delivering flowers back then - we've all come a long way.... I had the cassette tape and listened mostly to those two songs. A few years back I bought the CD and with a more mature ear realized that this wasn't something that you listened to over and over, back to back, but took out once in a while and listened to all the way through, letting it take you on a journey. Those two songs are still the highlights of the disc, but amply supported by the surrounding cast. This is alternative at it's shining best, challenging the listener instead of just being ear candy."
4,Import version from Thailand,"I really enjoyed this cd when visiting Thailand in 2002 I bought the Thailand import version with a bonus disc containing DJ Vortronik, Gary Ponte, DJ Gabry, DJ Gregory, and Burn down da House Cut. Wish I could get another copy of it.Other than that, great electronica band. Has there been any newer albums out lately?"
2,Outdated and Disappointing,"I purchased this book based on the strength of its recommendations here. Now that I've taken the test, I'm disappointed.The book appears to be out of date as several topics that were on the exam are NOT covered in the book.Microsoft has added things on Software Update Services, Distributed File Sharing, and Scripting to the exam that are nowhere to be found in the pages of this 977 page tome.In addition, I found several things that conflict with other study guides, Microsoft's published materials (MDSN, TechNet), and the Windows Server 2003 help files.Although the book has a set of practice questions at the end of each chapter, in many cases their ""correct"" answer was wrong (based on additional research and conversations with other MCSA/MCSE's).When I wrote Syngress asking for an explanation about the discrepancies (twice), I never received a response.I'd recommend you look elsewhere if you hope to pass."
1,Great vendor!!!,"I would use this vendor, again. Quick respose to questions. Fantastic customer service. Too bad that this item was DOA. Not vendors fault."
2,Tubes on tubes might be too much,I tried the Seymour Duncan SFX03 between the Custom Shop 1960 Strat and '59 champ. It was a little too much of a good thing. All the sparkle was missing from my guitar and it sounded very muffled. I suppose I could experiment some more but the initial results weren't promising. Went back to an ancient sans-amp I have laying around.When using a cheapo solid state amp this thing can sound pretty good.I don't have as much time for guitars as I would like so I end up not mucking with gear and just practicing whenever possible.
4,"If you can't beat 'em, join 'em!","This book was a fun read and I must say that I am that much more knowledgeable about the sport; yet still a good way to go! My husband has gotten a kick out of my new found interest and looks forward to Friday's to start the weekend trash talking!Holly has made understanding the game less complex while offering historical information, from the origin of the game to who has the cutest butt! All jokes aside, I think Holly is credible, mixes good humor with wit and breaks the game down as a woman would, paying attention to the details! Since reading the book I have been able to connect with other women; sharing my excitement. I feel a sense of empowerment as they begin to ask the questions that they may have been embarrassed to ask over the years.There were a few areas that I had to really focus my attention, but overall, I'd score this one a TOUCHDOWN!!!"
2,Whiny and not very useful,"I was looking forward to hearing from a football wife and a lifelong fan of football on the in's and out's of the game. My son is starting to get into football and I want to be able to keep up and not ask my husband ridiculous questions. I was disappointed to read a whiny and self-serving diatribe on how ""hard"" it is to be a football wife. I didn't learn much about the game. It was bloated with random knowledge that I didn't need. I am now going to buy an Idiots Guide to Football so I can actually learn about the game."
2,"Bland Music, Bland packaging, not worth it","I didn't really think this CD was as good as everything I had read about this group promised. The music was all the same, and just wasn't very interesting. Dentelle was the only song that I felt was worth listening to, but everything else just sounded boring. If you want something a little more colorful and interesting, check out Yann Tiersen, Carla Bruni, Les Trois Accords, Kyo, M, or Noir Desire. All very different, all of them soo much better than this."
1,"It works, but come on","I absolutely hate that I had to spend extra money after purchasing software that requires this thing. Plus, there's the account set-up too. How anyone could like this is beyond me. I'd give it a zero if I could, but it does work... like every other dongle out there. I think this is a borderline scam"
5,Stop rating the messenger,"Reviewers seem to be missing the point, which is to rate the Vendor of the product based on your experience with THEM.You may not iLoks or the software developers who use them to prevent piracy, stay in business and GET PAID for their considerable efforts. If so direct your negative reviews to Pace, the maker of iLok, or to the plugin developers. The company you are rating here simply sells the product; and at a very good price.I know that noone here would ever want their music stolen, how would you eat? I'll bet you're jelly because you can't but an iLok on your own band's digital downloads.JMHO"
1,Worst Tree Stand Ever,"We got a tree this year that was over 8 feet tall. Our old stand wouldn't handle that so we ran to the local large chain hardware store. Found this tree stand, figuring it had to be good as it was only one of two in this size range that the store offered. What a mistake. The tree was always crooked and we adjusted it numerous times. Now this morning, the tree toppled over, all by itself. We put it back up, made a lot of adjustments on the screws. It toppled over again.If you read this prior to buying a tree stand, this would be one I would stay well away from. The heartbreak of sentimental ornaments being broken as they hit the floor is not worth it."
2,Quality just not there,"When I got this mini dress the first thing that I saw was some discoloration on the back of the dress, like the dye or color did not fully cover the dress. The second thing was how short it was, I know it is a mini dress but it looks like they left something back at the factory. Granted it is a small but not sure it will be wearable."
1,Lewis Taylor deserves credit for his work......,"Lewis Taylor doesn't receive credit anywhere on the album for his song, Betterlove. Anthony Hamilton's cover sounds like a cheap go-go version of a great song, written and produced by Lewis Taylor. Lewis Taylor is unknown to people who don't really know anything about music, but he does have a few fans out there, and I'm very proud to be one of them. If for some reason you dig Anthony Hamilton, check out Lewis Taylor's body of work. That's what real music is all about."
4,Hidden Gems,"This is better then SoulLife. Not as good as his So So Def productions but still full of his gritty, blues voice. I suggest it to any fan of this genre ."
3,comments...,"Just wanted to point out that 'While the Earth Sleeps', the duet with Peter Gabriel, was featured on the Strange Days soundtrack before being here."
1,"a waste of time, seriously","if i could go lower than a 1 star rating i would. i took the entrance exam for a reno area college. i studied this book for weeks beccause the school just switched to kaplan teesting from the teas. kaplan testing, kaplan study guide, you would figure the study guide would have something to do with their own test. nope, not a bit. i spent hourrs and hourse studyig this guide for the test. on test day, only 3 or 4 test questions had anything related to the study guide. and, i am not exagerating even in the slightest. save your money and your time, seriously. i will NEVER buy or open a kaplan book again. i strongly encourage you to review your basic ""check book"" math, very basic chemistry (ionic bonding etc.) and finally, A&P; is essential..... good luck to all.namaste"
1,vet in a Spin,"BEWARE, I purchased this series thinking they were a continuation of James Herriot's first four but to my disapointment the publisher riped off the public by reprinted the original stories under a new title. I tryed to return them but gave up and donated them to the local library"
5,Great lesson!,"We used to read this book to our daughters when they were children. Since we lost track of our original book, I decided that we needed a new copy to read to our grandchildren.The kids in the story keep going to their grandpa with ""big"" problems, and his standard reply is, ""could be worse."" It seems that Grandpa is just helping them to put things in perspective as well as understand that there really is no complaint department. That is unless you take into consideration the person in the mirror- and they really don't want to hear you belly ache either! In the end, he tells the kids a wild exaggerated story of his ""problems,"" and they take great delight in telling grandpa that it ""could be worse!"""
3,"IT'S GOT HEART, BUT NOT A BODY","This music is not at all well-played; it's choppy, un-focused, and repetitive...but this IS The Grateful Dead we're talking about, so it's not like you can really expect much more out of this record; but the music is nonetheless high-spirited when it hasn't been re-played 1,000+ times in a row for a while...it's happy music, but not always, when it's not happy, it's atmospheric; I was raised in central California where people like Phil Lesh (spelling?), Jerry Garcia and Bob Weir, etc. lived so perhaps that has something to do with my liking of this CD (not to mention my liking of '80's and general pop music MINUS the heartless crud of today i.e.: boy bands & every ""American Idol"" ever Idolized, etc;). This is high-spirited music from a high spirited decade before being happy was a good way to get laughed at...I don't blame Bowling For Soup's ""dream""girl for being ""pre-occupied"" with 1985, or 1987 for that matter..."
3,Look elsewhere,"This may be the better version available on SACD, but both the recording and the performance leave much to be desired. The definitive version still remains Bruno Walter with the Westminster Choir. If you prefer perfectly clean sound, a close second is Sir Colin Davis with the BBC Symphony Orchestra. Both of these recordings are light years ahead of this one."
3,Never Look Back,"Having recently bought Harnoncourt's earlier 1987 performance of the Requiem on Warners Apex, reviews persuaded me to try this later SACD/hybrid version. While the recorded sound is more sumptuous and, maybe, the instrumental playing is more perfect, I prefer the earlier performance which is more direct, has more energy and forward momentum. This later version is more ponderous, over-manicured and self-conscious. Solo contributions are more aggressively operatic with too much over-expressive rubatos. The playing time of the new version is short at 40 minutes whereas the Apex now adds another Mozart mass."
2,Mismatch,"Carly's voice is simply not compatible with this type of material. She does not have the range to carry it off. I literally cringed listening to this CD. Try Linda Ronstadt's ""What's New"" if you like these kinds of songs. Linda has a much more versatile voice than Carly, and a much much wider range."

3,"Girl, Interminable","Girl, Interminable, September 15, 2005Reviewer: A customerThis book is a great tale of life in a psychiatric ward.However, due to its diary format, it has no beginning or end, and certainly no main plot, making it easy to put down and pick up later.I wish the author the best, but I didn't get much information that would be practical for my own life out of her book."
2,Middle G at best,"Not Kenny's best. Try ""Classics in the Key of G"". It's highG and hands down better than this one."
5,One of the Oldies but Goodies,"If the dating game were based on smell...this cologne would be outlawed.Earthy but you don't smell like a hippie.Herby but you don't smell like a hippie.Woodsy but you don't smell like a woody hippie.It's the smell of Fall rolled into a bottle with-a pumpkin pie rolled into a hickory fire rolled into a vanilla muffin served by a band of giggling angels.Over the past 15 years I've had more women, young and old ask me what I was wearing and yes it was because they actually loved the smell. From Varvatos to Gaultier, from Egyptian and Arabian oils straight from the apothecary..this is the animal that tames them all. It's a shame it's not widely distributed anymore."
1,snoozerinofest,"honesly I forget now where the impetus came from to read this book, it was mentioned somewhere... in a rollicking context, biography of Wilde or something. Well, forget it this book is very dull. just pointles random crap lol about running a hotel... with the occasional uproarious story that isn't even very funny atall, as far as my tickle me parts go. znooserino!"
2,One of cheezy lounge singer Murphy's better later efforts...,"Lounge singer Mark Murphy has taken a few Cole Porter classics and latinized them(not with a hip Cal Tjader style latin band) with a Vegas lounge sounding bango big band, his lack of rhythm and overall cheeziness, make this set not so essential. However it's better then some of his other recent releases."
4,Tricky Book,"So this is my first Prob & Statis class at school.. After reading most of the reviews of this book I mostly agree with all of you..This book DOES have a lot of errors.. However.. I think that those errors make me more alert as to what I'm learning..Even my professor told me, "" the reason I like this book is because 50% of the solution manual is wrong.. and mixed up.. it forces you to think.. to become a real engineer... "" (Im trying to be a EE)So my review to this book is as follow ... buy it if you REALLY study a lot and have interest in probability & statistics.. u wont find it hard.. & interest in engineering of course.."
3,The style dominates,"I think whether you will love this book or whether you'll hate it depends on what you think of the style. Half the book is standard linear narrative, the other half works backwards to the start of the protagonists career. However the chapters are interleaved, one going forward in time, the next a stage back. So there is a prologue at both ends.I found this annoying in parts, and ask myself what I would have thought of this novel if the chapters had been arranged chronologically.My answer is I would have thought it's OK, but no more than that.I think the ending is suppossed to shock, but instead made me feel that there was a lot never explained in terms of the protagonists motivation."
3,A little boring,A slow story with nothing new. You will need a lot of patience to get to the end and it may not be worth the effort.
5,back jacket summary,"from the back cover of the April 1992 Bantam Spectra paperback editionCheradenine Zakalwe is an agent of Special Circumstances, the elite weapon of the Culture's policy of moral espionage. Zazkalwe has meddled in the destinies of countries, races, entire planets - with everything from military action to plain old dirty tricks.Finally he's been thrust into the fray on the losing side one too many times, and he chooses early retirement. Yet when Special Circumstances suddenly decides that they want him back, they never anticipate that regaining the burned-out agent will all rest on the power to manipulate his one fatal flaw."
2,Left me wanting,"I've read many of mr banks books which have been excellent. This one was disjointed and hard to stay involved in. The synopsis held so much promise. After reading all the way through ( i paid for it, so I'm reading it!)Too many guilt trips, emotional morass- give me more science fiction less crying about the past. More Skaffen-Amtiskaw!"
1,Gamera the Brave,Worse Gamera movie ever. It had nothing to do with the last 3 of the series. It was about Gamera dying in 1973 witch never happen to save the earth and a boy who found his egg and was there when it hatch. I had to fast forward threw a lot of the beginning because it was boring and stupid. The boy named Gamera Toto after the dog in Wizard of Oz what that about. Very dull movie and I would not recommend this movie to any Gamera fan. You think they would of continued with the movie after Revenge of the Iris. they had to make this bad movie witch made no scene from the beginning to the end. This was a waste of money and will make a really good coaster for my coffee. I gave it one star because I couldn't leave it blank. Its not even worth that star. Very disappointed with this movie and I'm a major Gamera fan.Gamera the Brave
2,Eh...,"The muzzle basically does the job so far, but my dog and I haven't put it to the test around other dogs yet. Partly because I'm still a bit nervous as to how it will hold up. The overall quality of the product is poor. It is basically constructed of a few pieces of velcro. The manufacturers could have at least made the product with a less abrasive material. I feel the product would chafe my dogs face if left on for longer than 15 minutes. All in all, it stays on my dog and works like the description minus the ""comfort"" part."
2,A disappointment,"I bought this album, not really knowing much about FLC. I had heard them play their version of ""We Have All The Time In The World"", and thought it was excellent. But this album is not. I'm only ginving it 2 stars because of the one EXCELLENT track, ""We Are All Very Worried About You"" . . ."
4,FLC are artists who deserve to be pop stars,"Why is it that, in America, FLC isn't on MTV 24-7? I bought ""Come Find Yourself"" because I entered one of those record deals and got hooked. ""100% Colombian"" does sacrifice the alterna-pop hooks of its predessessor, but what these NYC guys gain is something much deeper--credibility. The smooth jazz and funk hooks here are way ahead of the mainstream. ""Love Unlimited,"" the band's ode to Barry White; ""Sugar,"" ""Southside"" and ""All For Self"" are all completely different-sounding tracks that manage to evoke the same cool FLC made their name with. And the name of the game here is escapism. FLC does it through Mafioso imagery in the same way Scorsese portrayed it in ""Goodfellas"" and ""Casino."" Get wise, or stay stupid, stupid."
3,My Heart's Cry,I was very disappointed in the delivery time this order took and the delivery charges are high. I received a notice on 6/1/05 that my books had shipped and I did not receive them until after I contacted the shipper. They were finally received on 6/25/05. The books received were in very good condition.
1,Worst movie ever! Do NOT Buy! U WILL HATE IT!,"This movie is not like all the other Christmas Horror movies at all. It is not interesting, very boring, has awful editing, etc. The movie's runtime is only 74 minutes, but they have long strange 2 minute pauses in quite a few different scenes where someone just stares for almost two minutes without even speaking. It is very strange, annoying, and unnecessary. This just dosen't happen once either. Many, Many times. If you would take out all the pauses, this movie probably would last 57 minutes. Even then, it would be 57 minutes of agony, because none of the movie is good. It's not the fact that this movie is low budget, because there are alot of good low budget films. This movie is so bad, that when I watched it, I listed it on ebay immediately after viewing it to get rid of this stinker & get my money back before the bad reviews came out."
4,"""Blue Vaudeville"" fromn Amazon","Andrew's book is a scholarly look at the social trends and stars of the vaudeville times in the US(1890-1930). It is well-researched and written and, with some interesting vignettes from the lives of the now-forgotten celebrity stage stars in pre-movies times. One chapter in ""Blue Vaudeville"" deals with the Canadian-born, cyclonic first rock-star Eva Tanguay. Her career flourished from about 1898-1928 and reputedly she was the one who ""made Vaudeville famous"". I am looking foreward to the coming publishing of his new book on the ""I Don't Care Girl"" Eva Tanguay.Ordering this book was relatively simple and delivery from Amazon, a fast week to Canada by expedited postage."
3,INSTRUMENTAL HAMMILL,"PETER HAMMILL IS THE KIND OF ARTIST YOU EITHER LOVE OR HATE, THERE IS NO MIDDLE GROUND, I LOVE HIS WORK BOTH SOLO AND WITH VAN DER GRAAF GENERATOR. BOTH MY WIFE AND MY SONGWRITING PARTNER ARE IN THE OTHER CAMPBUT THEY HAVE OFTEN MADE THE COMMENT THAT THEY MIGHT LIKE AN INSTRUMENTAL CD. WELL HERE IT IS. PARTNERED WITH GUY EVANS THE DRUMMER OF VAN DER GRAAF AND A FREQUENT COLLABORATOR ON HAMMILL'S SOLO ALBUMS, SPUR OF THE MOMENT IS COMPRISED OF SPONTANEOUS IMPROVISATIONS. THESE SOUNDSCAPES ARE REMINICENT OF THE BEST OF BRIAN ENO OR ROBERT FRIPP. THEY ARE SLOWLY EVOLVING, AT TIMES ENCHANTING, AND ALLWAYS LISTENABLE. THE CATCH: THEY LACK THE DRAMA AND EMOTION THAT ARE TYPICAL OF HAMMILL'S BEST VOCAL WORK. THIS MAKES THIS CD AN INTERESTING CURIOSITY BUT NOT AN ESSENTIAL CD FOR THOSE WHO ARE INTERESTED IN HIS WORK. PURCHASE THE UNION CHAPEL CONCERT, A MORE VARIED RELEASE BY THESE TWO, FIRST."
5,A Useful Textbook Style Reference Guide,"I like the fact that I can easily identify the aspect, look it up and incorporte it into the Chart interpretation. One can definately tell that Kevin Burk is a teacher and a good one at that. He explains that the interpretations are his and not the only valid ones. The goal of the book is to help budding astrologers to acquire building blocks to understand and develope their own understanding and interpretation of the Moon's Node. This is an often misunderstood aspect of Astrology but Kevin Burke rises of the the challenge to promote understanding. This is a added deminision that I can include in my professional chart. Thank you Mr. Burk Namaste!!!!!!1"
1,Not even close!,"In all my years of reading parenting books I have never seen a book miss its mark by so far. The authors have no grasp on what really motivates good behavior in kids...teaching them to do the right thing, nurturing a conscience and helping them strengthen their capacity for self control....the struggles working parents may have disciplining their kids is only related to their knowledge about good parenting and has little to do with working! Next time these two write a book they really should take a moment and actually learn about what they want to educate the public about. In the meantime..stay clear!"
3,The nasty words based on the great back ground,"To show the background by characters,I can hardly say that it did a nice job.The same thing, I think Charlotte Bronte's Jane Eyre did much better than that. If the he think using that way make some real-life style. I could just say it is nasty and unbelievable but not real-life."
2,When Doves Cry,"The cover of this record intrigues me: I'm thinking that Patti must have been cleaning the birds' cage (which would explain why they were freely roaming around her apartment) when the picture was taken; or, on the other hand, maybe Patti never caged the birds at all due to concerns over damaging their auras or something. Whatever. Anyway, speaking of damaged auras, mine certainly has been since I played this prententious mess of an album. Apart from ""So You Want to be a Rock and Roll Star"" (which is viciously amazing), WAVE is the work of a clueless hack. Maybe Patti should've posed with a couple of horses on the cover instead...."
1,Harmony's Honey all the porn star divas are performing solo act! No sex at all on this video including the cover Harmony Bliss!,"Harmony's Honeys stink big time! I thought this video have some hardcore sex!There aren't any!!!! All the porn star divas are performing masturbation solo act!This isn't worth $20 bucks to spend on this piece of 60 minutes garbage! Sorry, butI was looking for some serious action for my hard earn money. Just watching a girlplaying with herself just doesn't arrouse a man!"
5,"Iomega ZIP drive, USB","A nice product. Solved a sticky problem for me. How to get files from an older WIN98SE Dell to my new HP Win7 computer. The Dell did not have a CD writer, and installing one was too tricky a thing for me to figure out. So using the ZIP drive through the USB ports solved the problem. Write to a 100meg ZIP disk on the Dell. Read it on the HP. The Iomega software does not yet run on Win7, but it isn't needed, as Win 7 immediately recognizes the ZIP drive and assigns it a drive letter, using its own built in drivers. Using Windows Explorer, copy and write was easy. And Amazon had it in stock and shipped it in a few days."
5,"Portable, Convenient, Fast","I used to own a Zip 100 Parallel. It was useful alright but it was heavy. The drive itself was kinda big and the power adapter was heavy.I was delighted to see the release of the Zip 250 USB Powered drive. Not only is it slim and lightweight it can store a lot of files. Since it's USB it's faster than the Parallel port drive so you could copy large files quickly. Since I travel to other countries, I don't have to bring a power adapter to make it work.Installation is a snap. Install the drivers, plug the unit into your USB port and it's ready to store your files. If you have Windows ME you don't even need to install drivers, just plug the drive in and it automatically starts it.Buy this drive, you won't be disappointed. They usually sell for $189."
1,Unreliable product,"In spite of having previously owned a Zip 100 drive that succumbed to the infamous ""clicking sound"" and eventually stopped working altogether, I decided to try out the newer 250 MB model on the assumption that Iomega had probably overcome the technical glitches.No such luck! The drive began working erratically within 24 hours, and by the third day would only read the 250 MB disk in the dark (I'm not making this up), with no daylight or lamplight present.I sent the drive back and got a refund. Never again, Iomega!"
2,Self-powered isn't the greatest thing since sliced bread...,"When run on one of my two USB hubs, my HP Vectra won't get beyond half way on Windows 2000 startup. On the other hub, it takes about 5 minutes to get beyond the HP startup screen and will then get through Windows 2000 startup if, and only if, there's a zip disk fully inserted in the drive. I think this will be my mobile drive and I'll spend half as much on an AC-powered model for my desktop."
3,Good when you need it.,"10+ years later the Zip Drive has all but disappeared from computers in office buildings and at home. However, some of the old 100MB and 250MB media remain. The disks are very tiny and barely useless anymore, however they may still be around your house and may need data retrieved off of them to proper archival to todays larger disks or flash memory.This drive was good to have in my IT department where we used it to backup dozens of old disks and also to securely erase before throwing the Zip Disks away.This drive is barely useful for anything else anymore."
1,What is this?,This product is horrendous. After a few months it would crash my disks and then the drive itself eventually died. Zip disks as we all know are not [inexpensive] and the drive would continuously destroy them. This has cost me not only money but lost assignments and projects that were on the [disfunctional] disks. Iomega replaced my disfunctional drive with another one which ended up conking out on me as well.I use this drive also for my PC. I plugged it into my USB port then suddenly my computer wouldn't start. Once I unplugged the zip drive the computer started working again. ???? None of my other equipment that attaches to my USB ports does this.Having this drive has been one disaster after another...
4,Available from Amazon UK,"There's only one outright clunker on this set, the Goldsboro, and that's more than compensated for by ""2-4-6-8 Motorway"" or ""Denis"" or even The Flying Lizards version of ""Money.""Finally, a box set that includes songs that Rhino overlooked.But why is it $55 in the States and only 12.99 (equiv. US$20) from Amazon UK??"
3,Great program but missing critical information,"Like the marvelous Streets and Trips program for the United States, this program has seeds of greatness. However, it is diminished by a failure to clearly and adequately disclose data gaps. When in Ireland I learned for the first time that the program does not have Republic of Ireland address search/location capability. This is a serious deficiency that forced rental of a vehicle GPS. Such gaps should be clearly disclosed prior to purchase. It was great in England and otherwise it is a useful program and easy to use."
5,MS AutoRoute Europe 2007,Easy to install and should work well with the Pharos GPS unit that I use with MS streets and trips 2005.
3,"Helpful, But Beware of Idiosyncrasies","Our experience with AutoRoute 2006 while traveling the UK and Ireland left us with the feeling that we were glad we had it but disappointed in its performance. Initially, its calculations of the ""quickest route"" led us on very narrow, one-lane, two-way roads--at least they were paved. We learned to be very wary of its directing us onto ""local roads"" instead of staying on numbered highways. A good map became an essential help in pre-evaluating AutoRoute's recommendations. Also disappointing was the degradation of some features; for example the ""add pushpin markers"" feature stopped working after we used it only a few times. Also, we could not zoom-in the map while using the Provide Driving Guidance feature, which uses GPS Tracking."
5,"GET YOUR LITTLE PAWS ON THIS, YOU NEARLY-HUMAN !","If you want to consider hearing this disc in a smokescreen, go right ahead.If you want to LISTEN to this disc, do so -- and intime you'll be clearheaded enough to treasure each note.NOT RECOMMENDED for the beat-box denomination."
2,just dont buy this,1.)some of the answers do not match with the explainations2.)overly repetitive3.) Most of the reading composition topics are the same as the blue book. They just changed some of the words.4.) Why buy this when you can get the real thing at collegeboard.com
4,The fantastic sieve!,I believe this sieve is really good and is a great kitchen utensil to own. We all should have one! Not only does it do its job but it is sleek and sexy. A great buy.
4,Classic Stallone,I really like this movie about a Vietnam turned police office going up against an international terrorist. Old school Stallone at his best
3,They need to stop while there ahead,"I bought this box set thinking it would be like the first three seasons. I didn't watch this on TV when the new season came on. Boy, was I let down, I didn't like the first episode, when they made jokes about Christians, and had Christ in it, not just the first episode either. They need to stop at season four, it's just not that funny anymore, like in the past."
2,Shouldn't have been brought back,"I consider myself a former Family Guy fan. Seasons 1-3 were well written, and joke filled. From season 4 and on, the stories become irrelevant and take a back seat to long winded jokes. Most of these are unfunny, and the writers hope that the repetition and extension of these gags will win over the viewer. Some, like my dbag former roommate Paul Vogt, say this is the funniest show ever. South Park hit the nail on the head when dissing Family Guy. Just know if you buy this set, you are supporting the manatees and their random, nonsensical jokes."
4,Family Guy Vol 3,Not quite as good as previous volumes. However it's still random humor at its finest.
5,What show was you watching?,"Ok, family guy may be mainstream now because they are everywhere and they may be using some of he same gags they did use but they are still funny as hell. I don't know what show you people are watching when you are saying its not funny, its still hilarious. It is still by far, hands down, the funniest, wittiest, most itelligent animated show on the air. Oh yeah it sucks that the stewie three part movie is not on the set, but the movie is AWESOME, it is hilarious I highly reccomend it, Go buy it too because it is worth it. Also I am sure they are not going to try to charge $35 bucks or so for the 13 episode set it will probably be around 20-25$ thats the same cost of the Chappelle show and it has roughly the same amount of episodes. But stop whining about the show being ""different"" and enjoy the fact that it is on and it is still awesome."
3,YOU'RE A PHONY!,"So it seems. The ressurection of family guy was rather dissapointing. Often reusing old references rather than creating new ones, it seems like most of the season is just filler episodes. And they're releasing a new DVD box set already?! It's only got 13 episodes on it! I'm not paying $30 for something this low quality, I'll wait untill it at least goes on sale. Hell, I was a big fan of the first 3 seasons (yes, this is the 4th) but it just isn't original now. Although there are funny new jokes (cookie monster in rehab, passion of the christ 2, stewie and brian as parents, etc) it just seems like a lot of recycled materials (God, I'm so tired of seeing ""The Greased Up Deaf Guy"" in every episode!!!!)."
1,"Very Dissapointed,","You know, it figures. No one watched Family Guy when it was on TV in 1999 and even though it was completely hilarious it got cancelled. Then A.S. picks it up and it explodes in popularity. Then finally FOX brings it back with a new season and everyone begins to watch it. However, there is a catch and that catch is that, well, quite frankly, the new seasn pretty much sucks. The first episdoe was good, but almost every other episode is pretty much completely dispensible. I definitely do not recomend this."
1,Dissapointed!!!!!!!!!,"How could anyone give this garbage five stars. The first three seasons of family guy are classic, this just sucks. The new season was a huge dissapointment, not funny at all. Stewy is no longer the hilarious little evil genius he used to be, now he's just a wise cracker, and the big long pauses between him and Brian are so annoying. Stewy and Brian's chemistry used to be great now it stinks. There are only three good eps. on this whole season. Don't waste your money."
3,As Always A Riotous TV Show!,"I can probably repeat myself when reviewing each volume of 'Family Guy', one of the funniest and cutting edge animated tv shows. Always pushing the envelope, this show almost knocked down many rules the FCC had placed for what tv can allow and restrict for viewers. Many kudos go to Seth for presenting his many talents. Only problem is why splitting the seasons up in volumes instead of just presenting each season as a complete season?"
2,yea its good but 1 season split into 2 for more cash is stupid,"its funny but i refuse to buy a season thats split into 2 just to make more money. ppl shouldn't pay for ripoff. 1 full season yea its worth buying, 60$ on both parts of 1 season umm no"
4,A lyrical story,"Even if you weren't a huge Bon Jovi fan or ever dreamed of having some guy on stage pick you out of a crowd, you will love this book. Jane is an unlikely heroine who can be an uptight lawyer one minute and then an insecure 16 year old the next. But this book isn't all about rock stars and fame, Jane has other more serious things going on in her life that keep this from being a one-note story, mainly the fact that she's still coming to terms with her father's death and her upcoming promotion to partner in her law firm. This book has you laughing one minute and thoughtful the next. It was a great mix that kept the story rolling. A side note, as a huge music fan, I feel compelled to point out that Bon Jovi, Poison, Warrant and Great White were all in the top 40 in 1989 : as a college freshman in 1989, I know this. Another reason why I probably liked this book."
2,...BUT YOU PROMISED US A BOOK,"This is a hardcover book showing the collected writings of Snoopy. It is a compendium of cartoons, publishers' rejection letters, visual jokes, and a mercifully short story, which rounds out this little tome. Written tongue in cheek and only numbering about sixty pages in length, it is strictly for die hard Snoopy fans. Anyone else will be disappointed."
1,Too Bad...so promising....so difficult,"What a disappoint this book is....BUT....for one reason and one reason only....the russian translation IS IN THE RUSSIAN ALPHABET!!!! Do you believe it????...and not a word about how to pronounce the words.....other than that....this is the BEST book around for the volume and variety of love phrases..unfortunately, it is worthless for me as I wanted to be able to say the words...not spend an hour getting the English alphabet Translation of the written Russian alphbet translation..so...if your honey is right next to you and you can show her the Russian equivilant you are home free...otherwise you'll be out of luck on this one....darn!!!"
4,Better than you've heard!!,"I, too, feel that Ms. Spencer has been much-maligned by ""fans"" of her boyfriend. I am a geezer and am thus not familiar with all of the people that other reviewers compare her to, but I enjoyed the album very much. It was a surprise to me because I had heard how ""bad"" she was in concert, yadda, yadda. I enjoy her voice which is perfect for the music and I would compare the feel of her songs to some of Loreena McKennitt's even though that lady is much more traditional and Celtic. To each his/her own, but I would recommend this album highly."
5,The birds,If you like Hitchcock this is one of his best. A must have for your DVD collection. Watch out for THE BIRDS!
5,Classic,"Great movie, have watched it several times and would recommend it to anyone, One of Hitchcock's Best Thrillers 5 STARS"
4,No Audio Commentary?,"What? No audio commentary on the new ""The Birds"" DVD? It looks like it has a lot to offer but I am amazed that there is no Tippi Hedren or Suzanne Pleshette or anyone else associated with this movie not asked to do this. What a shame! The movie has so many fascinating elements and it would have been very interesting to hear these people comment throughout the movie. What was Universal thinking?"
5,TWO KINDS OF SCARY,"There are two types of scary. One type is mostly what you see today, gross blood and gore, with a crazy guy with a fishhook digging it in to good looking teens. The other kind is what Hichcock did best, the more phycological scary. It makes you think, becuase you are never sure exactly what is going on. Ignore the fake looking blood. The movie was designed to make you think and it does."
3,The critique of The Birds,"Alfred Hitchcock's The Birds was an exceptionaly entertaining movie. It was an action packed thriller for the time. This 1963 version of Daphny DuMoure's book The Birds, was well portrayed in the movie with exceptional actors. However there were extra peices that made the story line more appealing to the American audencies. Tippi Hedren and Rod Taylor did a wonderful job in the spot light. They really made the movie their own. The romance between the characters Melanie (Tippi Hedren) and Mitch (Tod Taylor) really added more of a dramaic twist to go with all of the films action."
5,one of my 6 Hitch faves...(in no order),"LOL Universal must have profits reaching all time highs as they do not seem to want to sell a DVD-SE of this title to the millions WHO STILL OWN DVD PLAYERS, who have no intention of getting into BR.Id fire the whole board of directors-they plan on selling 2-5 million BRs and skip a potential sale of 30-50 million DVDs.---STRANGELY Universal started releasing 2 disc SE titles from the 2005 restored Hitchcock box, then abruptly...stoppedPSYCHOVERTIGOTHE TROUBLE WITH HARRYREAR WINDOW (?) so far Maybe TORN CURTAIN and ROPEMARNIE is from the 2005 MASTERPIECE SET, but before they decided to make them super deluxe standalone titles in 'book' formLIFEBOAT was a shock to watch after viewing the MASTERPIECE SET-FOX should have been shamed into restoring itI anxiously await THE BIRDS SE"
3,"Good film, long story.","In the days of early special effects, drama was long so was the story in this film. Don't get me wrong, I've enjoyed the Birds. But, there are several areas that should have been stewed down. Maybe it was an effect to create more tension in the story. I got bored. After first few bird-strikes, didn't, guess what was coming next?"
3,BirdMania,"A well-made movie by Hitchcock. It was a frightening account of a bird invasion of Bodega Bay. Although a direct reason for ""the birds"" attack on the people in and around the Bodega Bay is never clearly stated Hitchcock paints a horrifying picture of human fragility and isolation.As soon as the new actress playing Melanie Daniels drove to the isolated village in Bodego Bay the questionable yet frightening attacking started. The entire movie had a feeling of aloneness and suspense due to an unknown reason of the fearful attacking. The story was always surrounded by the sounds of birds freakishly squawking and scratching which gives it its horror movie feel.The fact that the characters were always surrounded by millions of uncivilized creatures that seemed to live on the pain of humans also contributed to the scaryness factor. The ending of Melanie's paranoia wasn't the best of conclusions as the survivors drove off surrounded by birds."
2,Probably the WORST Hitchcock film I've seen.,"'The Birds' is one of his ""classics"", but it is not a good movie. The concept is bad, the graphics are bad, and it is too simplistic of a story to be compared with Hitchcock's best films. Every artist has a dud once in a while. It looks like great Alfred had his with this one."
4,Unforgettable,"This is one of those landmark films where if you saw it in the theater when it was released, you never forgot the experience.What I'll never forget - and this is true, so help me - is that moments after I left the theater, a couple birds swooped over my head. I thought I'd have a heart attack at the age of 18!! I never forgot that. It still creeps me out.Since then, I've seen the film at least a half dozen times, on TV, VHS and on DVD and always found it fascinating....even 40-some years later. Sure, it doesn't pack the wallop it did when it came out, and it's a bit too talky in spots for today's tastes, but it's still scaryI'd like to see a good Blu-Ray treatment given to this film, since I've never seen a great transfer of this movie.....and that includes this disc, which looks grainy (and why I gave it four stars instead of five.)"
3,Hmmmm...,"'The Birds' Is kind of a 50-50 movie. At times, if you've never seen it before, it can be a little, well, shocking. The plot, however is actually very thin, and the movie virtually has NO ending. I don't like sayng anything negative about a Hitch movie, I'm typically predjudiced in his favor. This movie, however, is rather mediocre. Buy it and watch it, you might like it, but give 'Psycho', 'Rope', and 'Rear window' a try too. They're considerably better."
4,Watch Your Eyes,"""The Birds"" is a thriller movie that takes place in Bodega Bay, California, near San Fransisco. Tippi Hendren stars in her first role as Melanie Daniels who is interested in a Lawyer, Mitch brenner, played by Rod Taylor. She travels to his home town and they find themselves bombarded by birds that are attacking and killing the locals.This film by Alfred Hitchcock is a nail-biting flick that shows you just how scary birds can be. It was a great movie until the ending, when it abrubtly ends after Melanie is attacked and they finally leave for San Fransisco. It leaves the audience hanging with no explanation of why the birds were suddenly attacking. Although I didn't like the ending, it left me open minded on how it could end.""The Birds"" is a scary movie that will leave your thoughts about birds sceptical and you'll be covering your eyes whenever you see a crow circling around your head."
3,If she could only act,Tippi Hendren may have spent her career fighting off Hitchcock's advances but one has to wonder why he was so entranced by her. Rod Taylor does his usual good job and the bird sequences are indeed scary but I would not call this one of Hitche's best.
3,NOT Classic Hitch,"I watched this again, having seen it the first time many years ago, and since then, seen many superior Hitch films. I know 5 star reviews for Hitch are automatic for some, but did you pay attention at all? Even someone with a slight eye for quality could tell there is something very off about this film.Suspension of disbelief = There was none. Highly implausable choices by characters. Ex. We're inside, let's run OUTSIDE and get somewhere safer! Let's get the children out of here! Let's take them OUTSIDE! Tippi Hedren's character looks into the upstairs room, sees all the birds, and THEN slips INTO the room. WHAT? And Cathy with the stupid Lovebirds, can we bring them Mitch? Can we take them in a tiny, FABRIC TOP convertible to make our escape. There were two other vehicles with hard-tops in this movie.Cathy's monologue after being rescued from the schoolteachers house was just heavy handed and artificial.Why Hitch? Was it the studio? Did they have your children at gunpoint?"
2,Wretched Hitchcock,"Hitchcock made some good films, such as North by Northwest. But The Birds was not one of them (nor Psycho). Direction and writing are nigh nonexistent. Was Hitchcock on tranquilizers while doing this film? If not for the special effects crew this film would be wretched, as is sometimes the case in Hollywood (such as The Mist, another example of extraordinary special effects talent mismatched with horrid direction and writing). I know, saying Hitchcock made bad films is like saying Michelangelo couldn't sculpt or Shakespeare couldn't write. But that simply isn't the case.The Birds is a drunken flop in all but special effects."
2,Looks ridiculous today,"""The Birds"" may well have scared its audience to death when it was realsed nearly forty years ago. However, unlike Hitchcock's materpiece ""Psycho,"" it has not aged well at all. ""Psycho"" is still scary, in part, because it was filmed in black and white and essentially looks timeless. Alas, ""The Birds"" was filmed in color and not only are the styles of the times distracting, but the movie's supposedly menacing title characters look silly. Hitchcock is, of course, is master of creating mood with his camerawork, such as the scene on the park bench in which the birds slowly collect in the background. Unfortunately, they have lost their ability to scare to an audience accustomed to more frightening visuals and thereby the effect just isn't there anymore. There is no doubt that Hitchcock was a genius and that this was one of his biggest triumphs. But today it is interesting mostly as a cultural artifact."
1,Dried up?,"Apparently the ink pad for this set was dried up. The stamps did not make a legible impression, even on white paper. Did not hold my grandchildren's interests at all, so I returned it."
3,Stamp set is okay,The animal stamps are cute but the ink pad is really poor. My daughter got this for Christmas and has used it a few times but the ink pad seems to be drying out already so I bought a new ink pad elsewhere.
3,Dry ink pad:( Everything else good!,"As many other reviewers commented, the ink pad that came with the set was dry before it was even opened. Luckily I knew this might be the case and had bought my niece an additional ink pad so she wasn't disappointed and not able to use the stamps. The stamps themselves are cute and both nieces liked them a lot. The wood stamps are nice and not cheaply made, so that is one benefit to the set."
4,Very Interesting Woman,This book is excellent to show the standards of the times. What a courageous woman to take on the man's world of teaching. I really enjoyed how she was able to work out all the details. I do feel sorry for the girl. Great realistic book.
5,ATale of the Times,"This book promises the story of a nineteenth century woman academic with a lifelong secret. It delivers that. The reader is also given repeated glimpses into American life, particularly in what is now the center of the US."
4,"""What'd we talk about? It's safe. It's very safe.""","This is one of those great thrillers that confuses as it intrigues. The first half of the film found me understanding very little except that Roy Scheider was involved with something concerning Nazis and the contents of a safety deposit box in a New York bank. Meanwhile Dustin Hoffman wrestles with demons from his past involving his father's suicide and the MacCarthy hearings.Then the parts start to come together in some of the grittiest and most suspenseful scenes in seventies filmmaking, leading to the pretty obvious appraisal that somebody's not too safe.This film has a great chase scene, some extremely good shootouts, and a torture scene that gives Reservoir Dogs a run for its money. The plot involves political history and ideologies, but only as a context for the suspense. And when the tables finally turned on Doctor Zell, I laughed as I cringed at the significance of the sentence Hoffman applies."
2,Paramount Does it (Not) Again,"Paramount, despite its marvelous archive, has been most delinquent in letterboxing its VHS tapes. I finally got tired of waiting and just bought Marathon Man on DVD (along with a DVD player) and can say that this is not good enough. The image is widescreen, but the transfer is crummy, with brackish colors and a grainy image all throughout the movie (most noticeably in the night scenes).There are some nice extras, however. No commentary, but two documentaries (one old, one new) and several rehearsal scenes. Notice that, in rehearsal, Marthe Keller's English is very good, which puts the lie to the claim made in the documentaries that she memorized her dialogue phonetically."
5,Dustin Hoffman at his best!,"Wow! This Thriller has everything...Action, Romance, Evil but believable villians, and best of all INCREDIBLE acting...Two Oscar winners star (Dustin Hoffman and Laurence Olivier) and an Oscar nominee co-stars (Roy Schneider)EXCELLENT MOVIE!!"
2,Some great scenes and performances....but IMHO overated.,"I know I'm not going to get a good response, but I'm afraid I agree with one previous reviewer.I too have heard alot about this movie, and I was somewhat disappointed. The infamous ""dental scene"" after all the build up was really disappointing.I suppose I could be dishonest to myself, join the band wagon and say that this is a great film. Don't get me wrong, there are some individual great performances and scenes. However the plots seem really disjointed. For the first half of the film, one sits wondering where everything is leading to. In one short scene almost EVERYTHING is revealed in one go. There is no clever ""unfolding"" of a story. Instead a character abruptly ""expains"" to the Dustin Hoffman character what is really going on.The film however does demonstrate Laurence Olivier, no doubt is a master at his craft.I suppose the film was good in it's time (70's)."
5,Keeping it real,"I have watched this movie since its release in 1976. I am very interested in the workings of government and the various methods it uses to gain access to information, capital gains, and the individual sources used for these purposes. I am a fan of Dustin Hoffman and the late Roy Sneider. I would recommend this movie for its insights and just for good movie viewing."
4,3 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:Though the movie does not make as much sense after the fact as it does while watching it, Marathon Man offers a number of excellent scenes held together by convincing performances and post-Watergate paranoia"
4,Is it Safe?,"Nazis in modern America trying to cash in the diamonds they stole from the Jews. Lawrence Olivier is great as the diabolical old Nazi. Dustin has the problem of not knowing something that he really needs to know. Torture, murder and suspense all wrapped in one treat. A ,70s movie that really holds up."
5,Excellent Thriller,"I had watched this movie years past when it first came out. I enjoyed it very much then, and even more now. Some rough language and bloody violent parts. Not for the faint of heart. Excellent movie. Can definitely recommend."
1,Just another Dustin Hoffman running man movie!!!,"MARATHON MAN is just another Dustin Hoffman running man movie!!!Hoffman plays a student who finds himself right in the middle of a convoluted Nazi plot, and he's basically Ben from THE GRADUATE all over again, only this time instead of running after Katherine Ross he's running from Laurence Olivier, William Devane, and some thugs. But Hoffman is good at running scenes--he makes them any average jogger can relate to--and Olivier is as sensational as a Nazi as he was in the 1980s as a Nazi hunter in the BOYS FROM BRAZIL.There's lots of interesting footage of 1970s New York City, but the best scenes belong to Olivier, particularly one in Manhattan's jewelry district where he is recognized by a former concentration camp victim. But William Devane is as bad as always, and the rest of the movie is ridiculous, and often boring.MARATHON MAN IS JUST ANOTHER DUSTIN HOFFMAN RUNNING MAN MOVIE!!!Chari Krishnan RESEARCHKING"
3,LOVE STORY LACKS SPARKLE,"MacGraw and Oneal look terrific together and that lovely score will turn on the tears every time. But this is a simple story that really relies upon great chemistry between the leads to make it soar , and that's not here. They seem wooden and uncomfortable with each other much of the time. Compare their scenes of intimacy with , say Montgomery Clift and Elizabeth Taylor, who also play doomed young lovers in A Place In the Sun... Different movie, different era ( well only 19 years apart really) but you can see the difference in emotional heft when the chemistry between two actors is there -when they seem really into each other and not just saying lines.I'd never seen Love Story in its entirety before but I'm glad I did. I can see why it may have been a huge hit in it's time, but it hasn't aged particularly well and it could probably benefit from a remake... Liam Hemsworth and Jennifer Lawrence maybe?"
4,"Good, but not for me.","I own several Wolfgang Puck appliances and for the most part I love everyone of them. So, I decided to buy this cookbook. When I got it I was disappointed to see how thin it was, and I felt the recipes were rather simple...well for me anyway. I was looking for something that would teach me how to do something new and I didn't feel this was it, so I returned it."
2,One of the best,"In my opinion, one of the all time best Hitchcock films. Very, very suspenseful and entertaining. Older kids (12 and up) can watch it too and be wrapped up in it's suspense. Love it!"
2,Where's the Oomph?,"Not much depth to this so-called ""comedy"", despite a well-regarded cast and lovable child actors. Domestic discord is ostensibly the focus, but it's not treated in a particularly funny fashion. Every so often, we do encounter a visual gag or a snappy one-liner, but there's really not enough oomph or sustained entertainment value to the film. Probably best to pass on this one."
2,This book is badly written.,"Upon entering 1oth grade Honors Government and Economy, I was forced to read this book to enhance my summer project. Throughout reading this book I came to the conclusion that this was a poorly written book. Although Kathleen Hall Jamieson's book contains good thoughts, she uses an over-exceedingly amount of adjectives in the process of communicating her philosophies. However, despite my distaste for her writing, Kathleen Hall Jamieson's book, ""Dirty Politics"", contains valuable information and is a decent book for someone who enjoys researching the medias' influence on presidential campaigns."
4,dont believe the hate!!,"I just got the DVD delivered and it was fast!! Ordered it one week, got it the following week, way before estimated delivery time.Now, Ive read all the reviews about this product and Its looks like an effective routine to alternate with anyones weight training rouitne. If your envious of Brad Pitts Fight Club, like me, then this and your body sculpting weights will do the trick. FORGET ABOUT THE ACTUAL 300 WORKOUT THE ACTORS DID, this is good, plus, they did that routine as a one-off test, not as a regualr workout.You can easily search the web for what they had to do to get prepared for the final 300 test and this is a very descent alternative, without weights, as it makes you use almost all the same motors as the actors had too.He even does the workout himself as demo for 40 minutes and hes raw with it. Make the investment, forget the haters."
5,enlightenment on the subject of hell,"I have other bones to pick with my born religion, however this book certainly cuts to the chase. If the hell of the Bible is real, then God is not good in the common interpretation of that word. For how could a God of mercy and love, also be the very climax of both eternal torture of most of his created beings and harbor the depravity of deriving great joy and pleasure from the same?"
4,May the real LEELA step forward please!!!!,"Yay - a story that shows that Leela is intelligent instead of a stupid savage. Put in her own jungle environment, Leela shines through as the star of this book even making the Doctor realise that even he has underestimated her. The only flaw with this book is it does tend to get a bit confusing at times. Well worth a read!!! Recommended!!"
3,Good but lacking the complete experience.,"The lyrics were definitely worthy of true Pink Floyd, but the music lacked the traditional ""out of body experience"" that other albums have provided."
4,"A few mistakes, but does a good job","I took the PCAT a few weeks ago and felt more or less prepared thanks to this book. The only beef I had with it in terms of content was that the Calculus and Organic Chem reviews weren't all that thorough. Consequently, I got a few surprises on test day, since all I studied for calculus was differentiation and integration, and I made the mistake of not bothering to study the reactions for Ochem.And yes, I did find several mistakes in this book, specifically:p. 70, #10p. 432, #8p.184, #6p.531 #4 (units should be cal/g*C, not cal/g*K)p.686, #41, value in table should be 8x10^-3p.682, #6p.700, #53I'm sure there are other mistakes, those are just the ones that I happened to mark."
2,Mistake after mistake,The book is one of the most awfully edited books by Kaplan. It's just one mistake after another. There are also so many chapter summary questions about topics that haven't even been mentioned. I am almost convinced that the person who wrote the chapter summary question and the person who wrote the chapter reviews are two different people who had absolutely no contact with each other. And the editor was probably sleeping.The reason I give it two stars is because it's pretty much one of the few books for comprehensive PCAT prep. So you're pretty much stuck with it. I recommend getting it for that reason alone.
2,Review of handbook in research and evaluation,I didn't like that this book was highlighted. It made it more difficult for me to read. Next time I will buy it new
3,Mildly Entertaining,"Well, I enjoy Barry Manilow's music, but this CD is a disservice to him. I was unimpressed with this CD. Yet, however, some of my favorites were on here, so even though I wouldn't suggest you buy this CD, I am happy to have it as part of a collection."
2,"Caveat emptor (Latin for ""blame Arista"")","The two stars are not because of the music...Arista has done Barry Manilow and his fans a terrible disservice with this rip-off CD and its two companions. Ten songs each, each guaranteed to leave off plenty of favorites. Plus, the beginning of ""Mandy"" on this is hissy and it uses the (non-hit) studio version of ""Daybreak."" The hit version came from ""Barry Manilow Live."" I had to look around to find the out-of-print CD version of the vinyl greatest hits album from 1978, which had 18 tracks. (The original Greatest Hits Vol. 2, also replaced by these atrocities, covered the hits from 1979-1983). Better as well to look for the British import ""The Songs 1975-1990"" than to reward Arista U.S. for its greed."
5,a good one,"There are a lot of good reviews here, I just wanted to throw mine in so I could give the album a grade.Lots of energy, excellent instrumental work; this is a very fine production by the standards trio."
3,Death On The Amazon,P.C's father invited him to the amazon.P.C's father is an archaeologist.He discovered some mummies at the amazon.He wanted P.C and Mackenzie to see it.P.C and Mackenzie got tickets to the cruise all the way to the amazon.The ship was own by Captain Hackman.The ship was called Inca princess.P.C and Mack was on the cruise and when they were sleeping they heard people screaming.At the cruise one their neighbor was Mr.Donnehy.The next morning they were at the amazon.At night they heard people screaming in the ship.They went in and found a freezier full of dead people.They couldn't call the cops because the nearest police station was hundreds of miles away.On the way home their neighbor Mr.Donnehy was murder by a member of the ship.
1,The ultimate in minldess widdling,"More than anyone else, Malmsteen generates the 'so what' attitude many people have towards widdling 'shredders' in that while he can play lightning fast chops, his music is ultimately soulless, forgettable and frankly tedious. There's more excitement in the opening bars of AC/DC's 'Whole Lotta Rosie' than in Malmsteen's entire oeuvre. Comments such as those from Fenris are the sort you'd expect to hear in a playground full of 6 year olds. As a classically trained guitarist myself I'm all too appreciative of brilliant technique and am a great admirer of players like Joe Satriani, Eddie van Halen and Steve Morse who also have the tunes, the self-restraint and the humour that Malmsteen lacks. The same can be said for the entire neo-classical genre, perhaps the dullest of all metal sub-genres alongside those populated by humourless dullards such as Staind, Alice in Chains etc."
3,abriendo paso gramitica,It was OK for my daughter as she just wanted to practice the spanish exercises. The book was in good condition
3,Logo Font & Lettering Bible,"Leslie may have an impressive resume but he really needs to get over himself. Whatever information the book provides is negated by his printer bashing, lame sense of humor and general bitchyness. I would rather hear from an experienced graphic designer not an experienced graphic designer that thinks he's a comedian. Leave the humor to Robin Williams. I forced myself to finish it because the subject is important to me but I'm sure I could find the same information elsewhere, more palatable."
5,Simonetti Morante Pignatelli,"Although technically not a ""Goblin"" CD, it reunites Claudio Simonetti (keyboards), Massimo Morante (guitar), and Fabio Pignatelli (bass) to compose the soundtrack to Dario Argento's classic, ""Tenebre"". Utilizing a drum machine gives the whole score a new wave-ish feel that's a little jarring at first if you're used to their prior work, but they build off of it in amazing ways (listen to the title track and how the mood and feel changes despite the 4/4 time kept by the drum machine; quite awesome, really). ""Slow Circus"" has a very queasy feel about the descent into madness as an adolescent; ""Waiting Death"" shows what incredible moods you can create just by remixing the ""Tenebre"" track; same with the reprise.This CD expands from the original album with 11 tracks, making the playing time to over an hour and the sound quality is quite good.Recommended."
2,Win1200....,Looked nice. 15 hours to charge!! I couldn't hear the phone ring! Volume does not go very high. Nice idea.....but recommend waiting until better versions arrive.JT
3,Split Decision,"When Stephen J Cannell is good, he's very good. When he's bad, well.... When he's bad he gives every single, minor, one-page character a nickname. It gets rather distracting when it descends to the Joseph ""Joe"" Green level.When he's good, he writes action sequences that grab you immediately and pull you into the book. Most of them are written well enough that it's easy to suspend your disbelief and just go along for the ride. And what a ride it is. Very fast-paced all the way through. The last 1/3 was a bit on the convoluted side, but not enough to make me stop reading.Not for the faint of heart. If you have problems with graphic violence, best skip this one. A whole lot of people are deleted violently on both sides of The Plan.While I would not rate this book as a standout, it did hold my interest and keep me turning pages. This was his first novel. I'll be reading more Cannell in the near future."
3,Coming Down...,"While there are still stellar moments on Placebo'sthird offering, you begin to get the feeling thatMolko's running out of things to day. Best tracks:Passive Aggressive, Slave to the Wage, Commercialfor Levi, Peeping Tom...- cRAIG"
4,andro/rock,"the placebo boys are at it again, with their andro/rock. taste in men sounds like he wants people to be shocked in his bisexual tendencies(bowie, nin, manson, queen, many others). that being a side show, it is a gradual listen, first time i played it, i almost threw it out. you have to play it five times all alone to really make an opinion. it has its moments, but in all, it is pretty damn good. not as good as wyim, but still good. it is pretty hard to top wyin."
5,Placebo do it again.,"Another fantastic album. My favourite that I have heard. In my opinion this is the best album of the year. I cannot find a bad song. My favourites are Haemoglobin (loud and fast, about a black man getting lynched in the 50s) and Blue American (about.. hmm.. books, and being pretentious I guess. Who is Uncle Tom?).Spite and Malice is an incredible collaboration with Justin Warfield. Taste In Men really grows on you after a listen or two."
3,"Great overview, but poetry translation could be better","This collection gives a nice broad overview of the Anglo-Saxon culture by providing examples of various kinds of Anglo-Saxon literature. It includes various forms of poetry (including a complete translation of ""Beowulf""), excerpts from several historical records, various letters, and some legal documents.I was not especially impressed with the poetry translation; the alliteration is sporadic in the extreme and the division of each line into two half lines of two beats was occasionally lacking. Seamus Heaney has a much better (stylistically speaking) translation of Beowulf and Lee Hollander is much more consistent in his translation of the very similar Norse poetry.Overall: a nice broad introduction to the Anglo-Saxon culture, but the poetry translation is stylistically lacking."
5,Geek-free resource for parents,Excellent down to earth resource for computer ignorant and/or illiterate parents who would like to try to keep up with their children when it comes to the computer.
2,"Not Particularly Informative, & Examples Are Sports Related","Basically the message of the book is ""Be nice. You may have to deal with the bully or impossible person again someday"".I didn't feel the book was particularly informative, and did not have enough clarifying examples. And, most of the examples given were concerning sports.I even went through the book a second time to see if I could get more out of it, but just found the book lacking. A much better book - in fact an excellent book - is ""How to Stop Bullies in Their Tracks, by Ben H. Leichtling""."
3,"Many cameos, little success","The film of an unfilmable novel, full of great cameos from a dozen well-known names like Alan Arkin (as main character John Yossarian), Bob Newhart, Jon Voight, Buck Henry, Art Garfunkel, Martin Sheen and many more. Great airplane shots, with dozens and dozens of bombers taking off. First five minutes show silent credits, dawn in the mountains, airplanes, eventually show humans, and then the movie picks up. Very artsy. Kafka-esque plot about paranoia and insanity. Great shot of 20 bombers taking off. Casual plane crash. Uses ""Thus Sprach Zarathustra"" two years after Kubrick did in 2001: A Space Odyssey. ""You're a very weird person, Yossarian"" sums up the film. Plane prop blasts guy on platform. Airfield destruction. A small-budget war movie with a cast of nobodies blew this out of the water at the box office in the same year; you may have heard of it, it was directed by an untested/untrusted director named Robert Altman, the film was called M*A*S*H."
2,"Somewhat Funny, but Doesn't Do the Book Justice","""Catch-22,"" the book, is much more entertaining than ""Catch-22"" the movie. The former is non-stop parody, the latter too often degenerates into burlesque and boredom. ""Catch-22"" the book succeeds partly because its author obviously had been part of the insanity required to get through military life and wartime. Mike Nichols did not, and it shows."
2,The book without the juice,"O.K. Anyone who has read the incomparable book by Joseph Heller cannot even begin to compare it to this film version with any sincerity. There is no comparison - period. The vast multitude of the nuances of the satire and their subtle quirks are lost in this less than stellar film adaptation.Although the cast is nothing short of a veritable all-star one at that, the less-than-thorough film leaves much to be desired. Alan Arkin is good as Yossarian and there are several other legit performances. That being said, I recommend reading the book a second time over watching this disjointed and convoluted effort."
1,Garbage - read the book instead.,"Most great books make bad movies (e.g. 1984). This film is no exception - bad acting, bad editing, sloppy ""translation"" of the book into a movie. The entire sarcastic brilliance of the book was lost in the movie. All of Yossarian's brilliant antics sound hollow and out of context, Milo's capitalist endeavors are depicted badly, the Generals' insanity is barely noticeable, and where is ex-PFC Wintergreen anyway?Don't waste your time or your money - read the book instead."
2,Crapstock Revisited,"This is what happened when the Hippies took over Hollywood in the 70s......Crapstock! This movie is a great example of the attempted woosification of America and has war protestor stank all over it. All the stars in this movie were popular for about 15 minutes, about the time it took to make this snoozefest. Pretty cool mass B-25 take-off, though."
2,catch 22,This film is antiwar movie. The war turn soldiers who paticipate in World War II into abnormal people. Wars are enermy of human
2,Falls apart.,"bought this for my son. He enjoyed putting it together with me, but after we put it together it fell apart. The pieces do not stay together at all, if it is moved the bolts come apart. Wished this toy was made better. Would be fun to put it together and play with it."
4,Good Purchase- Building Fun,"I bought this erector set for my son for Christmas. He just turned five years old and loves to build. He had to have help reading the instruction booklet and needed help to put it together. I think he will catch on and be able to construct by himself once he gets a little older. He was very excited to make the four-wheeler and asked when he could make another. It is a good toy and seems to hold up well other than the little ""headlights"" fall out easily. We are happy that we made this purchase and it was cheaper on Amazon than in the catalog I had found the product in."
4,A worthwhile addition to any library,"The Ultimate Encyclopedia of Mythology is not really complete in that it doesn't cover the African, Australian, and North and South American mythology, but other than that it does a good job of covering the rest of the world's mythology. The myths covered include Greece & Rome, the Celtic world, the Nordic lands, Egypt and West Asia, South and Central Asia, and East Asia. Each section or geographical area is lavishly illustrated and well-researched.It makes for an interesting read for those who are fascinated by world mythology, and also serves as a valuable research tool into the myths of ancient cultures."
5,Impeccable!,"Great choice of her famous songs, showcasing her incredible, versitile, vocal talent.Best female vocalist in modern pop, soul, dance, jazz history!"
3,Average compilation!,"This CD contains great songs but if you want a BETTER collection of Phyllis Classics, invest in:1.Arista's 2 CD set 'The Legacy of Phyllis Hyman'2. and the new 'Phyillis Hyman:Arista Heritage' CDLet's hope that a BOX SET will be released to honor Phyllis's Career."
2,Not Kind to Women,"SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER was a very popular ""R"" rated film with young audiences made in 1977. It featured John Travolta as Tony Manero who lived in Brooklyn and spent his weekends at a local disco with his buddies. It was very popular at the time and reflected the time and place somewhat accurately but was criticized for its use of foul language and its depiction of young women as sex objects. Even though the film was realistic in part it was giving the wrong message to all the young people indicating that certain types of amoral behavior was a reality and was acceptable. For that reason the film was re-edited and reissued in an alternate ""PG"" rated version."
3,SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER DVD,"SHIPPING WAS FAIRLY QUICK. DVD WAS HARD TO SEE, MANY BLURRY PARTS MOST LIKELY DUE TO THE AGE OF THE FILM. VERY HARD TO SEE WHEN IT WAS DARK IN AND OUTSIDE."
4,Disco bursts onto America,"I am personally not a fan of John Travolta, but this is a fine film with great performances. For those of us who well remember the mid-70's, this can be a slightly painful film that documents the era well.The Blu-ray transfer is not up to the snuff of other Blu-ray transfers that I have seen. The film is grainy, almost like it was originally 16mm. It may be what there was to work with, but it does not have the crispness and clarity of other transfers. The sound, however, is wonderful, if you liked the music of the era!"
2,Fevered,"I'm going against the grain on this one. I hated it. Sure, the music is great, but the characters are truly some of the worst people I've ever seen.John Travolta plays a spineless wuss who lives at home then struts about on the disco floor like a girl. But, it's the girls he's after, and he lays them, and leaves them like he's making a deposit in a human sperm-bank.His wish to attach himself to another human being is parallel to the lack of actual physical contact on the dancefloor.His friends are a bunch of jerks, one of whom tries to prove his manhood by falling off a bridge.But, all this garbage is set to a great soundtrack!"
1,i didnt get to enjoy,couldnt play on my DVD player as the wrong region number. very disappointing. how can i ensure that i can play all DVDs ordered on my player here in australia ?
4,First R-rated film I was allowed to see...,"...at only 10 years-old. Needless to say, my parents did not approve of all the profanity and almost made us leave the theater.This is not only a great film which represented the disco pop-culture of the time, but it also defined the social struggle between classes within Bay Ridge, Brooklyn. The group dancing scene during ""Night Fever"" is very pivotal because it showed that despite all the differences and prejudices of the neighborhood's youth, they were able to come together as one on the dance floor.I remember seeing this film again when it was later re-released as a PG version. I learned for the first time what a joke bad movie editing could be."
5,"History, not just entertainment",Mr. O'Neal has done the research necessary to accurately portray the true story of the Old West.
1,Cannot recommend,I live in the desert and have a real problem with static electricity. I shorted out the controls on a hi-tech coffee maker with a static spark as I touched it. The wrist band has been no help with this problem. It only helps with the small static shocks that sometimes happen with the ear buds from my iPod. I don't recommend you purchase this if you are assembling any circuits.
3,"Not for preteens, EVER","Well, I would give the actual story a 5 on a scale from 1-10. But considering content... I am 14 years old, and I definitely wouldn't reccomend it to ANYONE under my age, and only a few my age and older.The plot is okay, it is very moving at times, but with the very graphic sexual scenes and the deaths some might call ""scary"", it's not appropriate for anyone 13 and younger. Heck, it even grossed me out. Advice: if you can handle sexual descriptions several times, disgustingly graphic hangings, and prostitution, this book is for you. Otherwise, don't even pick it up. PLEASE save yourself from the therapy that I will probably have to go through now that I've finished it."
2,President Forever Is Better,"This is a fun game, but ""President Forever"" is much more detailed and comprehensive. Give it a try."
3,Love It Or Hate It,Very biased game programing. If you're a Democrat you will love it; if you're a Republican you'll hate it.
2,Republican Propaganda Game,"This game is ok as a game and midly entertaining but I resent how obvious it is that the creators are republican and are lying about people's attributes in this game.Such as republicans integrity being higher (almost all) than democrats. Or the media bias being consistantly higher for democrats when studies have proven that there are more positive stories about republicans in the press and more negative stories about democrats.Also blatant historical inaccuracies such as washington being a republican, the republican party didn't even exist until Lincoln and back then the republicans were the progressive party so in todays terms he would be a democrat."
5,Now this is insightful!,"You don't see too many films like this nowadays. Alfred Hitchcock is, to say the very very least, one of the most gifted human beings ever born! This film stands as one of the most stunning criticisms of Social Darwinism, the concept that some groups of people are created with survival and contemplative skills better than others. Another amazing fact about the film is that there are only a handful of edits, meaning that the whole film was shot on the same set, in the same apartment! It leaves you thinking about the power of words and mankind's conceded self-destructive nature. Buy this movie and learn from it, that's all I can suggest."
2,one of Hitch's rare disappointments,"Nail-biting suspense? Yeah, right. There is no suspense here, no real detective work either - the two killers act so downright nutty that even a child would finger them as the ones behind the missing man's disappearance. Stewart's sudden transformation from supporting murders in general (which was never believable anyway, only unpleasant to listen to) into a horrified ""good citizen"" is contrived. Give this one a miss unless you're a Hitch fanatic."
3,False start for Hitchcock-Stewart,"This was the first of four collaborations between Alfred Hitchcock and James Stewart, and it was pretty much of a catastrophe. It was filmed as a stage play, with the camera up on stage among the players, all in continuous takes. The murder mystery plot was based loosely on the Leopold-Loeb case a quarter century earlier. The movie was roundly and correctly condemned when it was released as being excessively cold-blooded; Hitchcock let himself get carried away a bit; and it flopped at the box office. Fortunately it didn't sour Hitchcock on James Stewart and they went on to make three of the greatest American movies ever."
2,Inferior to the original,"If you liked the original, you will be disapointed with the sequal. It had a really lousy story and bad performances by all. . I do recomend seeing it though if you are a fan of Revenge of the Nerds."
1,Booo-ring,"As you can see, this movie is rated PG-13. The first movie was rated R. So, this movie does not contain any nudity as in the first one."
1,Stick with the unannotated edition,"Appel's annotations are simply insufferable. It's pathetic and depressing to read his sniveling Kinbote impression--is he completely unaware that he represents exactly what Nabokov was mocking in Pale Fire? Even trying to use his annotations as merely a reference to help translate the French in the book will leave you quivering with rage, as Appel submits you to his Stanford ENG 300 course, draws absurd and positively indefensible parallels (some of which that he even admits--with the appropriate quotation from a letter as evidence--Nabokov expressly disavowed), reveals the entire narrative by page 70, and, in a meta-textual burlesque (which, ever self-aware and oh-so-meta, Appel audaciously compares to the effect created by Pale Fire) completely robs your reading experience of the chance to form its own impression of the work.Under no circumstances buy this drivel. Nasha Vladishka deserves better."
5,Minor details highlighted,"The reader would do well to get the annotated ""Lolita"" which adds so much to Nabokov's work and enhances one's perspective on the novel. One example of many--the name ""Vivian Darkbloom,"" who is Claire Quilty's playwrighting partner--is an anagram of ""Vladimir Nabokov."" Buy this book!"
5,Some of the most beautiful English prose ever written.,"It would seem strange that a story which deals with pedophilia and murder could actually be described as poignant. But this is most assuredly the case here. One does not find oneself sympathizing with the book's ""protagonist"", Humbert Humbert, the aging pederast who is seduced by 12-year old Dolores ""Lolita"" Haze. However, his story is so brilliantly told by Nabokov that so long as one perseveres past the ""perversity"" of pederasty, one will be rewarded with a complex and enlightening glimpse of the human soul."

4,Revised his teaching some since 1995,I watched some tips on Youtube and thought he was really good. I had employed these about two years ago with success and rediscovered them. The tape is basic and his concept is the same-just some changes in instruction. I believe he is planning a new DVD. I would not have purchased this item had I previewed it first.
4,Great preparation guide,"The nat'l geo series is a fantastic trip preparation guide. The photos, stories, insights into culture - this helped us choose which regions of OZ that we wanted to visit. For this I give 4 out of 5. The last star I reserve because some of the smaller places are not listed that are real gems! It is understandable though that no guide will have every dot on the map, this is why you travel and explore!! Note: for this sort of preparation and planning activity we have found no better guidebook series!However, what we've found is that these guides are not good for hotels, restaurants, etc - there are a few (expensive!!) listed. Nor are they good for navigating/driving (we drove Melbourne to Cairns). I recommend using this guide to prepare and a Lonely Planet to find places to stay/for for more budget conscious traveler needs. Get a good road map."
5,This is great!,This is what real Bigfoot Hunting is all about. Pure field Research. This is not the hyped up for TV footage. It is the real thing.
5,This is the one...,"I'm no hardcore, dyed in the wool Deadhead, but I gotta say, this is the Dead recording that finally made me realize what the Dead were all about. Prior to hearing it my Dead listening experience consisted of those well-worn FM radio staples - Truckin', etc. I really didn't understand what the big deal was all about. By the time I heard Cassidy in all its expansive glory, I was blown away! There are so many great performances of great songs sprinkled throughout this recording, but I whole-heartedly agree with the reviewer that the version of Eyes of the World in particular is very, very special. If this song doesn't put a smile on your face, I can't imagine what brings you joy. I'm so grateful that such an inspired performance has been captured forever."
2,I was disappointed in this book.,"I should have looked to see what else this author has written before I bought the book - her penchant for New Age subjects would have warned me off. I wanted a book with a lot of Celtic/Gaelic names for a baby. There are those, but half the book is taken up with surnames (not what I was interested in) and the names of Celtic deities (interesting, but again, not what I was looking for).And if you write a book with Gaelic names in it, PLEASE include a guide to pronunciation! I admit that my knowledge of Gaelic is pretty limited, but I am pretty sure that some of the pronunciations the author did give were wrong, which didn't exactly inspire a lot of trust in her research.All in all, I'll probably return it."
3,"The Celtic Book Of Names: Traditional Names from Ireland, Scotland, and Wales D. J. Conway (Author)",I purchased this book for my stepson & his wife when they were expecting their firstborn -- I assume they found the 3 books quite useful -- I did not personally read it
4,extensive summary of fabs,"For those of you working in a fab, or designing processes to be used in it, May gives a good summary of what is generally known and non-proprietary. He explains the key steps in photolithography, wet and dry etching, the different ways to dope, and deposition processes.But along with these steps, every fab needs to monitor them for quality control. So we get discussions of how to measure data about a wafer. Like using inteferometry or ellipsometry to measure the thickness of a deposited thin film. Or using a four point probe for capacitance or resistance measurements.A lot of the text also deals with statistics and how to maximise your device yield. Involves numerous modelling choices and process controls."
5,If You Sing You Need This Book,This book is amazing. There is so much information in here that each time I read it I learn more. There are alot of good vocal books/programs on the market but Raise Your Voice will get you singing higher and free from strain faster than any other. I had the pleasure of meeting Jaime a few years ago and taking a day of lessons with him. Great Guy and extremely knowlegdable about the voice. Listen to the praise he got from James Labrie of Dream Theater. Buy this book and change your voice today!
1,The buyer beware!,"You would think that for $50 dollars and $11 dollars shipping and handling (ouch!), you would receive a most excellent hoodie. NOT! Even though Old Glory describes the hoodie as a ""high quality black sweatshirt,"" this is the most cheaply made hoodie that I've ever owned. The material is so thin that it can pass for a tee shirt! As for the hood of the hoodie, it is so small that if you actually wore it over your head, you would look like a Teletubby!...Not my Style.Also, the ""Olde English"" logo has that ""distressed"" look that some people find Kool, but to me means it's just going fade faster. If you're so enamoured with ""Olde English"" that you just have to own this Hoddie, please order it ONE SIZE LARGER, because it does shrink. But then you're stuck with it because Old Glory DOES NOT ACCEPT Returns on Items that have been washed. A Complete Waste of Money!"
4,Catchy stuff,"I am definately not one to keep tabs on who is the ""next big thing"", but I will certainly say that I was surprised by this album. Despite what Victory thinks, The Audition don't really sound like Taking Back Sunday, Jimmy Eat World or Fall Out Boy. I've been listening to Jimmy Eat World for a while now and I've listened to a lot of Fall Out Boy, and they really don't sound exactly like either of them. I would say that some of their songs remind me of something that might've been on Jimmy Eat World self-titled (formerly ""Bleed American) album. Anyway, I was surprised at how some of these songs really hooked me. I'm generally one who thinks that most of the music on Victory is crap, but I actually like The Audition. Don't expect anything groundbreaking, but if you allow yourself you can have some fun singing along with this one."
4,"beautiful little book, who cares about nick cave!","Beautiful little series of books which I was coveting (mea culpa) long before I bought them. It seems awfully unfair for the people below to give the book such a low rating becase 'nick cave' didn't introduce the chapter. Who cares?I enjoyed the format, design and lush language of the book."
5,Now a classic.,"Rise of Nations took all the best parts of Civ and the AOE series, wrapped it into a neat package that transcending through the ages, giving us an RTS experience like no others at the time.How much fun did you have nuking your friends because they were too slow to get their missile shield up?Or loosing the Terracotta wonder/army to another player because you did not have enough builders working on it.A fun, fun RTS experience with lots of replay-ability. I just wish Rise of Legends had been as good."
1,56HM66 TV stand for Toshiba 56 inch DLP TV,"For a matching TV stand I expected the quality to be at least good. What I got was a rickty poorly designed stand made from very cheap particle board. Pieces were misidentified in the instructions and hardware ""screws"" were missing. Add in sheets with the instructions indicated the stand had a history of collapsing. The additional brace may prevent that but the stand is unstable. This Toshiba TV stand is made up of 25 dollars of substandard materials to hold up an $1800.00 television. The Toshiba corp should be ashamed to have it's logo on such garbage. Poorly represented substandard merchandise sold for a premium TV. BRILLIANT but not really."
3,"A little young yet, but the potential's there.","I love Raymond Carver, but I would say don't read this one until you've read Cathedral and What We Talk About When We Talk about Love. Simply because this is his first collection, and it's a little rough.There are good stories here, and definitely hints and flashes of what Carver will become. His talent for small-talk dialoge is apparent and the shining moments in this book come when couples get together and talk. But he has not perfected that bright, clean, no-nonsense tone that became his trademark. There is a feeling of a lot of borrowing tones, writing like other writers, and playing around. Which is all fine. But the stories here lack the vision and power of those in the later books.So read those first. Then, when you're hooked like I am, come read these."
3,A little too bland for me...,"I enjoy Carver's work a lot, however, I'm a stickler for wild metaphors and imagery. Carver's stories seem a bit too plain, however, they're also brilliantly concise and simple. His portrayals of the blue-collar American family are magnificent. Unfortunately, I found myself falling asleep rather quickly."
3,This digital frame gets hot.,"I purchased this frame as a Christmas gift. Works pretty well, but it WILL GET VERY HOT if left on for long periods of time. Also, the color on the LCD seems to have shifted slightly since we started using it. Makes me wonder how long it will last before the heat build up takes out the LCD backlight.Picture quality is pretty GOOD for the price ($99), but don't expect a high-res image at this price range. It is NOT computer screen quality. It comes with a USB cable and a media card adapter, but if you plan to show anything on it you will NEED TO PURCHASE AN SD MEDIA CARD. They don't make that very clear in the description.It really only takes SD media.The 5x7 frame is interchangeable with any 5x7 frame that fits the locking mechanism. That looks like a nice touch, but I have not fit it into any other frames yet. Based on my limited experience with this type of product, I would say that I am satisfied with it."
4,Picture Frame,Picture frame was good as it was advertised. Low pixels but good picture none the less.
2,You get what you pay for,"Ho-hum. It was the cheapest I could find, and I got what I paid for. The picture isn't very sharp. It's most glaring defect is the lack of brightness control! All the pictures are too bright, and look washed out. All I could do was the laborious job of adjusting the brightness of each picture on my computer before putting the pictures on the memory card. Ugh. Too much work! Spend some more money and get a better digital frame."
4,Happy with this product!,"The frame was easy to load with pictures. It looks great on a tabletop. It makes a wonderful gift for family or friends far away. One difficulty we found was that the frame can not be adjusted to have the slide show come up in random order and as a result each time the frame is turned on the hundreds of photos in the memory start over at the beginning and this could become rather boring in a short time. Overall, the frame was a great purchase and I am satisfied."
2,Far better models for similair price range,Far better models for similair price range - dissapointed with the quality of the finish etc etc. works fine though.
2,Not impressed,"This picture frame has a low resolution, resulting in a very grainy picture. Your pictures may look wonderful in your photo album or on your computer monitor, but it won't look good into this frame unless you are squinting! Also, the frame doesn't have internal memory and doesn't accept a CF card. This requires the user to plug this into a computer or purchase a separate memory card just for use with this frame (which adds to the expense). Since the price of these frames are consistently decreasing, I recommend spending an additional $50 for a frame with higher resolution and internal memory or CF card compatibility."
5,exactly what I needed,"I didn't know anything aobut guineas until I got this book. It helped me understand how guineas could benefit my life. If you need information about guineas, get this book. It is definitely the most informative book on the market."
2,Limited at best,"This is a sweet little book but the information it contains is limited at best.It gives many ""rules"" for keeping guineafowl, many of which simply don't apply to most of us. The section on incubation is woefully inadequate, and much of the book consists of chatty posts lifted from a website, which are heavy on opinion but pretty lightweight if you want real help, or substantial information on these interesting birds.There's little in this book which you won't be able to find in an hour or two of surfing. Save the money to buy more birds, and don't bother with the book."
4,Very helpful,Very helpful information on every step of owning guineas. We are looking forward to the adventure!
4,Cute and heplful,"Jeannette does a charming job of explaining just how she raises Guineas, and inserts lots of funny stories along the way."
5,So far so good!,"I just started my fiestaware collection (I am a college student). These bowls were the first things I decided to get. I am in love with the vibrant colors and the size of them. They will be perfect for soup, which is what I intended when I bought them.Also, they arrived quickly and with no flaws from amazon. I will not be making a trip to the crowded mall to buy more of these this Christmas! I am going to start buying place settings and gusto bowls next! I am so excited."
1,who is the man...,"Being that I enjoyed the theme song oh-so-much, I thought I would check out this movie. Big mistake. I was hoping for a cheesy but fun 70's movie. Instead, I just found a pointless storyline with one dimension characters and groan-inducing dialogue (""You ain't so white either""). I turned this fluff off after 33 minutes. Let's just hope the remake's better. Until then, I'll just be singing the song."
4,Showcase performance for Rich Roundtree! Moses Gunn equally good as villian,"Great early 1970's Det. movie starring RichRoundtree as tough cop out to bust criminalrings run by Gunn. Supporting cast outstanding!Copied many times, but never duplicated in junk'blacksploitation' films of the genre and era!Gunn later was very good in many pics, especiallyClint Eastwood's underrated 'Heartbreak Ridge'and Roundtree, Eastwood starred with Burt Reynoldsin City Heat, also a good, but somewhat disjointedfilm Dir. by Richard Benjamin."
2,"Like an uncaring employee, it can't be trusted","I learned the hard way with this machine that it's the cheap man who pays twice. I bought this fax based on price thinking one fax is as good as the next. Not so. In my opinion this is not a machine for business use because it can't be trusted to send more than 2 or 3 pages at a time. The automatic document feeder, which I've learned is really what distinguishes a home fax from a business one, is incapable of separating a stack of papers and just sends them through the machine in a jumble. The problem is that unless you've counted the pages, you'll get a report saying the fax went through just fine, when in fact it sent half of what you thought went through. Unless you stand there and watch the pages go through, you won't realize that it didn't sent the critical 30 page fax you wanted it to, but 24 of them. I'm going to buy a new machine based on the rating of the adf from this point on and hope I don't have a problem returning this one to Amazon"
5,It has been good,I've had this for a couple years. It is a good fax. When our copier runs out of toner we use it for a copier--although the copies tend to be a little light. It has been well worth the money.
5,something about you,"level 42, swing out sister(break out), t'pau(heart and soul), breakfast club(kiss and tell)....typical urban music.. I love these very much..very soft, comfortable.."
3,"Good compositions, but a little generic...","...I remember this band during the 80s having a couple of hits. These guys are actually accomplished musicians and on each track the detailed chords shows it. Unfortunately, they were playing what every other 80s band was playing at the time, so it's not anything unique. Sticking with their jazz/rock fusion beginnings might have produced some interesting compositions. However, the one song that has stuck in my mind all these years was ""It's Over"". This ballad is highly intriguing because of it's unique chord transitions and Wally Badarou's ethereal keyboard textures. The lyrics are bittersweet and fit nicely in the song's rhytmn. The final bridge is the hook of the song and the fadeout is natural; most fadeouts aren't.Level 42 fans may not agree with my selection of this song; people like the band for their power-pop ditties, not their ballads. But ""It's Over"", ""Leaving Me Now"", and ""Starchild"" seem to stand out most for their fine craftsmanship."
3,Some of the parts are better than the whole...,"You'd be best served purchasing ""World Machine,"" ""Running in the Family,"" and ""Staring at the Sun,"" as they are the parts of Level 42's body of work that really stand out. Their early tunes, such as ""Starchild"" and ""The Chinese Way"" sound like poor attempts at mimicing early Prince. Later stuff like ""Take Care of Yourself"" is just too lite-rock. The essence of the band is in their mid-80's work, and ""World Machine"" in particular."
5,"color is great, condition. . amazing","The red is, as other reviewers here and elsewhere have noted, a truly lovely multifaceted red, shimmering copper, with none of the pinkish tones you might get elsewhere. What gets me, though, is the truly great condition my hair is in after I color, even before I apply the package conditioner. I had been using Clairol Natural Instincts because I can sometimes get itchy with a permanent color, but I got sick of the wash out and fade, so I tried this (after the allergy test, natch). I am a natural dark blond, btw. This has to be the best permanent color I've used, and I intend to keep using it. Gorgeous color, leaves hair feeling good, and no itchiness. What's not to love?"
2,Not worth the price,"I don't know what I was thinking, ordering hair color off the internet. I could've gone to CVS or Walgreens and paid MUCH less. The color came out beautifully but I'm not happy with the price I paid."
4,Love this hairdye!,"This dye is great if you have light brown hair and want to go red. I have tried a few other red hairdyes, and none of them have ever turned my hair this beautiful shade of red. Most other products turned my hair much darker and the red seemed almost burgundy. However, this is a lovely shade of red, and my hairdresser even asked if I was really a natural redhead! If you want a natural looking easy-to-use product, definitely go with this! It's hard to find in stores, but the Amazon price is very competitive and delivery is always prompt. As with all reds, there is some fading, but it didn't turn ugly or brassy. All in all, a great buy for girls wanting a natural red look without paying the big bucks at a salon. Also, I recommend using two boxes if you have long or thick hair. My hair is about six inches below my shoulders (in the front) and super thick and I use almost all of two bottles."
3,Deceptive cover,though I liked the product but it would be better if it was mentioned on the cover that it's a 1 time use only and even after both my husband and I used it there was still so much left. Keeping that in mind it was very expensive or just waste of money.
5,Been using Feria since it came out!,"Can't say enough good things about Feria haircolor. I've been using it since it hit the market, and will use it as long as it stays around. The multi-tonal color is so natural. If I keep my roots touched-up, people honestly don't know that I color my hair (it helps that my natural color is blonde, but a darker shade, so my eyebrows, etc. are blonde).The color stays true and this absolutely DOES NOT dry your hair into wheat straw. I have used it every 3 weeks or so for over 10 years, and my hair has never been in better condition. Use a good shampoo likeJohn Freida Sheer Blonde Highlight Daily Shampoo 8.45 oz.. I have used this shampoo and also the hair spray off and on for as long as I've used Feria. It DOES make a difference.Now I have my color on a subscribe & save, so it is always here and my hair always looks great!"
3,"An eye opening account, a little dated though","Overall,I did enjoy the book. It had some interesting facts about different parts of the world plus definitely made me think in ways I have never thought before. I thought the material was a little outdated plus, some of the specific topics, even though true and applicable, were easier said than done to implement.I thought the book was informative though. I guess one of the points that matter is that I am infact NOT a fugitive, therefore, the opinion of someone actually ""on the lam"" would probably a little more useful. Nevertheless, if you want an interesting read from a different perspective, go for it."
5,Gorgeous modern samba classic!,"Martinho stays close to traditional samba values here and the results are unashamedly beautiful. It's rare to hear an entire disc of music from the early 70's that hasn't dated in the slightest - IMHO it never will.This is acoustic samba, marvellously arranged and performed with seldom-heard joy. A fine disc with which to begin (or deepen) a Brazilian music love-affair!"
4,Do you love the library? So does Lucy!!,Lucy is a quiet little girl who enjoys quiet activities like reading and going to the library. At home Lucy has 6 NOISY brothers. One day the librarian gives Lucy a special book she thinks Lucy will enjoy. When Lucy gets home her brothers are all doing noisy things. She decides to read them the book. Do you think they listened to the story? Read this easy reader to find out!!The book is part of the green light readers series. Young children will feel a since of pride when completing the book. There are very few words per page and the story moves at a fast pace.The book is great for readers who are learning to read on their own. The story ends but not the book. It has a craft idea and discussion questions to ask after reading. Lucy's quiet book would make a great read aloud for story times and classrooms
2,Bring Back Girl You Know It's True!,"Bring back ""Girl You Know It's True"" because it was a top album and just because the two people on the cover didn't sing doesn't mean the ORIGINAL album shouldn't still be available. Nobody likes these remixes. The only reason people are buying this is because they are trying to find some way to buy Milli Vanilli Music. They want the original. BRING ""Girl You Know It's True"" Back! Please!"
5,Great visuals,"This book is not much on narration -- but it isn't really supposed to be. The book is filled with outstanding photographs, prints, drawings, maps, and architectural plans that will be useful to anyone in the business of teaching social studies. This is one of those wonderfully inexpensive oversized hardcover books that makes you feel good just by owning it."
3,Doesn't look the same,"The replacement was not the same thickness or color as the original, even though it was supposed to be OEM product."
4,Very Useful Travel Mug,"I have owned and used one of these for about a year. It has never leaked although I don't take a chance by laying it flat. It is easy to use with one hand and doesn't spill. A minor complaint is that it doesn't keep liquids hot or cold very long. It works well, but when I use it outdoors in hot weather the ice will melt within a couple of hours."
3,Better for people having triplets or more.,"While I found the book helpful in some ways, with quite a bit of humor, some good advice and cost saving ideas (ex: how to use paper towels instead of buying expensive diaper wipes), I also found the book more geared to people with triplets or more who do not plan to breastfeed. Also, it didn't give much advice to parents who already have one or more children.As I only have twins and I felt very strongly I should breastfeed them, I found other books much more helpful."
5,Colleen Coble knows how to develop an intricate plot,"This first book in Collen's Rock Harbor series will suck you right in. Every time I started to think I knew ""whodunnit,"" the story took a different twist. I was so happy to find out that things weren't as they seemed (happy for Bree) but I won't spoil it for the reader by putting what happened in this review. The emotion is real, the scenery is vivid, the plot is involved. I enjoyed it so much I sent it to my aunt in Michigan and she said the scenery made her feel like she was back at Rock Harbor on vaction, it was so realistic. Neither of us could put it down."
2,Nothing to Brag About That is the Truth,"I bought this through QVC, with the shipping and tax and all, came out to over $50.00 and not worth half of that amount. True--it does make the hair soft...but that's all--I did not like it--I found that it made my hair unmanageable rather than manageable. AND it is very, very, did I say very greasy and very messy to use. Also even worse it is very hard to wash out because it is an oil not a cream. I had to wash my hair over and over to get this garbage out. Yes it is garbage and I returned it to QVC Do not buy this. Want a good conditioner--I recommend anything by John Frieda"
2,Not so magical,"I bought this product because my stylist (Ulta Salons) recommended it. Then i decided to come read the online reviews to see how good of a product it was. Nevertheless i have to say that i didnt see any differnce in my hair when using this product if anything i was experiencing more breakage. I have permed african american hair. I am not impressed at all. However, thanks to the other reviwer that broke out the ingrdients, i have started making my own conditoner and hair oil and that had been working GREAT!!!! Regarding the smell i do not mind it at all."
2,I just don't know,"First of all, this should have been a 2-disc set. Second, they should have done what Iron Maiden did and let the fans vote for what songs to put on this hits package. Does anybody really like ""Conga""? Why put the edited versions of songs like ""Mama""? ""Mama"" is a great song and the disc should contain the entire song. I guess I gave this cd 2 stars because of the choice of songs. Not that these songs are bad, but they could have chosen better songs."
4,"Greatest Hits... yes! ""Greatest"" Hits... nope!","People-This album surely has many of the Genesis songs that I like. But all of the Genesis songs (classics) were left out. They only had two songs on there with Peter Gabriel. It is still a good compilation for someone who just likes hits.There should also be a broader range of songs. More than two-thirds of the songs on there were from ""Invisible Touch,"" and ""We Can't Dance."" The album was also a tiny bit disgraced with the edition of ""Congo,"" from ""Calling All Stations"" (in my opinion, worst Genesis album).And where the hell was ""Lamb Lies Down On Broadway?"" They could have taken off ""Congo"" for that song. This album is only okay!"
2,Throwing it All Away then Carprt Crawlers - huh?,"If you are a casual Genesis fan and don't understand why that is nuts, definitely stay away from this release. ""The Way We Walk #1"" is much better if you want ""The Hits"" - Genesis sounds much better live, and you get full versions of their best known songs. For the die-hard fan, buy this for ""The Carpet Crawlers"" only. Excellent vocals by Peter Gabriel and Phil Collins. However, the rest of the album will make you cry at the sorry state of this band. ""The Hits"" only includes awful edited versions - ""ABACAB"" and ""Tonight X 3"" are cut in half, and gone are the incredible instrumentals that made this band fantastic live. For great NEW music, try Steve Hackett's ""Darktown"" - an excellent release with 100 times more integrity than ""The Hits"" total sellout, last minute ditch to try and regain the band's popularity."
3,What A Major Letdown,"Genesis is one of the bands that a two CD greatest hits would have been worthwhile making. it does have some of their hitmaking singles, but it leaves a whole load of charted singles off. where is ""Your Own Special Way""#62, ""No Reply At All""#29, ""Man On The Corner""#40, ""Paperlate""#32, ""Illegal Alien""#44, ""Taking It All Too Hard""#50 and ""Never A Time""#21? these were important songs that should have been included on the CD, but were left off for stuff like ""Congo"". the only plus side was getting the 45 R.P.M. versions of some of the singles which were not available on CD before. the reunion song with the ""original"" lineup is OK, but i wish they would have put their minds together and come up with a kick-a** original."
2,Don't even bother,When I first bought this I thought it was going to be great! It wasn't until I listened to the whole thing through I noticed this. RADIO EDITS!!! A lot of the songs on here where chopped in half! this is why im never going to buy a greatest hits album ever again! Because of the radio edits! I wouldn't recommend buying this album this album unless you are just becoming familiar with their work.
3,Carpet Crawlers is nice!,"Carpet Crawlers is quite nice. It's worth buying this compilation only for this song. It's great to hear the core 5 once again playing together after such a long time apart. The remake is not as good as the original in my opinion, but still is great to hear."
2,What a BIZARRE compilation!!,"This is probably the strangest ""best of"" or ""greatest hits"" package I have ever purchased. As a life-long Genesis fan (who is most fond of the 1970's version(s) of the band), I purchased this disc mainly for the new version of ""The Carpet Crawlers"", which I might add is excellent (although slightly over-produced). But who would have ever thought that ""Carpet"" and ""I Know What I Like.."" would ever end up on the same disc as ""I Can't Dance"" and ""Jesus He Knows Me""??? Anyway, the collection is still a MUST for the Genesis fan due to the inclusion of the new version of ""Crawlers"" (Which, by the way, I feel would have been better suited to be included on the boxed set), as well as the single versions of ""Mama"" and ""Abacab"", which have been previously unavailable on CD."
4,A Very Good CD,"There should have been another song or two on this CD (""Congo"" should have been left off if for no other reason to make a room for a true Genesis hit).Carpet Crawlers 1999 is a teriffic song! I hope all of the members of Genesis will get back together! (Wishful thinking on my part!)"
3,Turn It Off. The Biggest Hits But Not Their Best.,"These are probably their biggest sellers but where is No Reply or Paperlate? Also, some songs appear as edited versions. This was not done very well at all."
3,A dated sound,"I like many Genesis tracks, but would rate their sound as very commercial and dated. I am aware of their music from the 70's which is of a more unique sound but you won't find much of that on this CD. The 'Invisible Touch' album received wide coverage on this compilation, and the singles from it weren't necessarily their best tracks, such as 'In too Deep' and the radio overkilled titled track. Still, there are some great moments on the compilation with the brilliant 'Follow you, follow me' and 'Mama'. 'Mama' was only a minor hit in Australia but it deserved better back in 1983. Like other reviewers, it would have been nice to see some more Peter Gabriel tracks on this compilation. Perhaps the record companies could release an anthology in the future."
2,quick read,"There are a number of books in this area that will provide a more comprehensive review and answers. I was disappointed in this book. Instead look at discussions in Dr. Lydia Meunier's Gender and Lasnguage Use, The Pary Line by Rachel Rafelman or Deborah Tannen's You just don't understand."
2,the cover says it all,"While I did not find this book as pedantic as some of the other reviewers, I would be dishonest to say that I have gained anything from the time I spent reviewing it.The author enters into the blossoming field of exploring the communication differences between men and women to show how to address them so we are on a level playing field. Her folly is typical of too many women I see in business and is evident even from the book jacket.A woman dressed severely as a man in business garb.If the author is a woman I would have anticipated a more understanding approach.Instead I read a book that treads down a worn path of anecdotal information with few practical remedies."
1,mar vs venus it is not,What is it about workplace stress and the differences between the sex that makes people think there are answers. This book is full of trite advice on the age old questions of the male female phenomena. The author is no heavy weight which makes wading through this pop psychology how to book tedious. One huge thumb down from this reader.
4,Great Olivia Classics,"If you love the old, country tunes that Olivia sings, you'll love this CD. I'm a true Olivia fan...have been for 23 years. This is a wonderful collection of my favorites. I can just pop this one CD in and have all my old favorites. I do wish that the CD were a more accurate account of ""Her Greatest"" by adding some of her more recent ""Greats"". That's the only thing keeping this from being a five star because I love some of her new stuff just as much as the older. Another great find for a true, blue fan is ""48 Original Hits"". It has all of these same songs except for only one...So it may be something to look at if you're wanting a complete set of her great classics...no recent songs though."
5,Good early Olivia tunes,"This is a really good collection of early Olivia songs. I like it because it contains selections not easily found elsewhere, I was especially looking for the song Country Girl and this was the only place I could find it without spending a fortune. I recommend this for any Olivia fan who wants more than just the typical greatest hits sold anywhere."
5,Olivia's Greatest Hits CD,"I bought this CD as a gift for one of my brothers, and he has said more than once that he's really enjoying listening to it. It includes just about all of her hits, and a few more that he and I both recognized from previous albums. Her voice is so beautiful, it doesn't matter that it's been more than 25 years since I first heard her sing. I'm very glad that I bought this CD for my brother, and will most likely buy more of her music soon."
4,ONJ Simply the Best Review,"To all ONJ fans and I am a Huge one this album is simply mistitled. I love Olivia's voice and most of her musical stylings. This album is Country Ballads and covers of popular 80's tunes. It is NOT a greatest hits album. A couple of her early Country Hits are included but that is it. Is the album worth your money, Yes if you are a fan, No if you want to get a compilation of her greatest hits. Far worthier titles exist for that. For those of you who may not know Olivia's voice, it is not typical Country. She has a pleasant girlish, sometimes breathy voice that snuggles down in your ear and soothes you. She does not have the power of a Celine Dion or the sultryness of say a Julie London. She is just pleasant to listen to and you can understand all the words. Get it if your are a fan to complete your collection. If your not a fan there are better albums than this to start with for a representation of Olivia's career and singing styles."
2,Beware,"BEWARE! BEWARE! BEWARE! If you are looking to remove scratch marks and scuff marks from the disc, DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT! I believe that I was misled into thinking that by using this product, I would restore the original finish to the disc. I sold a used cd on Amazon as ""Like New"" condition. As I packaged the product, I noticed that the disc had some light scuff ( round circular) marks. I purchased this unit, thinking that it would correct this problem. IT DID NOT! The disc now has lines around the entire disc making it unsellable in ""Like New"" condition. The disc played fine before and after using this device. If you are looking to restore the original shiny surface of the disc, DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. As for restoring a disc that is unplayable, that, I can't tell you about because my disc played fine BEFORE I used this system. I will now try to look for something to restore the original finish. Stay tuned"
5,Almost as good as RELIC...,"Wonderful novel! Just a little short of Relic. The whole mystery unwound a little too early. And something at the ceremony beneath the crystal chandelier gave away the otherwise shocking ending. A good editor should have caught that.Otherwise wonderful, engaging, page-turning fun! Loved it."
5,Worthy successor,"It's hard to write a decent sequel to an excellent book, but RELIQUARY is everything we could expect from the team that gave us RELIC. It builds from the first book but does not just copy. The great characters are back but have been allowed to react and grow from the events in the first book: something many authors forget to do, and how could anyone not change after the events in RELIC? Suspenseful, well written, a definite great read."
2,Just when you thought Relic couldn't get any cornier.,"Even though Relic wasn't all that, it did have its moments. Just as this book did. Unfortunatly that moment was when I closed the book after reading the last page. Sure the whole ""Stop the plant before it destroys our eco-system"" dilemma was intriguing. But when the final confrontation between them and the *gasp* wrinkly people was over, I couldn't stop laughing. If your in the mood for a book that fails to follow plot lines, and makes absolutly no sense at all then by all means read this book."
2,Letdown,"Nothing like Relic. If you like spending your time in tunnels in the dark with no map, maybe you'll like it. Very poor ending which explains very litlle. They bombed on this one but don't give up on them . The best is yet to come!"
4,Another Page Turner by Preston and Child,The authors have written another thriller. I had to read the next chapter but neglected my tasks to do so. The authors gave substantiating data on the underground of Manhattan. However the ending was not in the characters' former behavior. Although it was a true page turner it lacked a believable ending. This book was not as good as The Relic nor the Book of the Dead the I have read by the authors.
2,Wheel will break off,I only had my vacuum for a couple of months before the wheel broke off. Do not buy.
4,I found this book in a overstock bookstore,I was very engrossed in this book as I read it. I came to understand the forgive and forget idea further by reading this authors take on it.
5,"Good tech, bad writing","The guy seems to know his stuff, but he has serious dfificulty in putting it all together. His writing is stream-of-consciousness, contains thoughts that don't need to be there and which may confuse students with little knowledge of the subject. But, like I said, there are good facts in the book if you know enough about the subject to glean them out."
2,Too little about too much.,"Looking at the book at a glance it may appear to be the right choice for the networking professional who is looking for a comprehensive book about today's network technology.Furthermore, McGraw-Hill books are usually well worth their price, however this one is definitely an exception.The author is overly ambitious in trying to cover everything. The result is a miserable failure in that it contains too little (f)actual information to be of much value. Buy it if you want a book that includes a lot of terms, and you don't care much about details and explanations."
5,one of my all time favorites,I read about these guys back in 1984. I loved their huge guitar sound was so similar to U2. Then they blew up the whole concept of what they were and went towards Irish Folk Music which was also amazing. H
1,Watch out - this edition is abridged,"The information on this edition says ""School and Library Binding"" ... what it doesn't warn you of is that this is *not* the original text. It is abridged for younger readers. If you want the original, don't buy this version. Amazon should make the abridgment visible. Bad Amazon!"
3,Good story.,"This book is not a page turner, it tells the story of the ""Little Rock Nine"" and follows the story of one girl in particular. I though that it was a good book although it did get a bit slow at times. All in all I though it was an ok read but would not read it again. ( a good story of what happened)"
5,Best book I have read in some time...,"Fresh story w/ a master concept as original as I've read since Allan Folsom's Day After Tomorrow. Buy this book, you will not be dissapointed."
1,Buy this book if you like insipid thrillers.,"Let's see - moronic plot, chases that you've seen a million times, stereotypical heroes and bad guys, extraneous arm candy babe companion, ridiculous threats, breakins, and getaways....This is a really silly book. The main plot revolves around the existence of a secret clan devoted to allegedly other offspring of Jesus. Uhhhh, yeah, sure, ok. All of the major events of the twentieth century were manufactured by the cult to ensure that it's ancient prophecies come true.Worst of all, the author has set up the finish for a sequel to this atrocity. Don't let it happen - avoid this tree waster."
4,The Standard... Sorta,"Bauckham has done a fine piece of work with this commentary, and his thoroughness in the Greek makes his points quite solid. My only real complaint is his arguments for 2 Peter not being an authentic letter by the Apostle. Although I understand his arguments, I think some of his presuppositions and conclusions have some holes. Michael Green's (less extensive) commentary on these letters addresses some of these points, and I think makes a better case for Petrine authorship.Aside from that, Mr. Bauckham's work is top-notch and does a fine job of correcting some erronious teachings that stem from Peter's letter. For serious and in-depth study, this is the commetary to have."
2,Only Chelsea Bridge,"Out of this entire double CD, there is only on 3 minute piece of perfection, never to be duplicated-good art can be like that, a miniature, its symmetry studied over and over.The song is ""Chelsea Bridge."" For all the decades that Ben Webster played it, in big bands, with strings, with guest artists, in Europe, he never quite hit that magical moment recorded live at Newport. It was him and Billy Strayhorn, who wrote it:chillingly beautiful. Strays piano is sparse and shimmering,The Brute plays his lush vibratto as always, just more so-if that is possible. That's how it goes on occasion, literally hitting all the right notes. I used to have the album, and ordered the CD for that one song. Yes, there are some other nice tunes, but it's more a grab bag than not. A lot to spend for one song, admittedly, but how much is perfection worth?"
3,Difficult? You bet!,"As one who both lives and works with difficult people, I thought this book might give me some much-needed help - and you have to love the title. In fact there was not much that I didn't already know but there were some good tips on how to defuse situations that might escalate into serious problems if not properly handled. This book would be useful for someone who has not already done courses or read books on similar subjects."
3,Difficult People Are Not Always Difficult,"This book has a user friendly approach and avoids concentrating on defining the ""difficult people"" by style, type or category. There are several interesting approaches offered for changing your behavior when dealing with difficult people because, as the author points out, the only behavior you can really control is your own.The author includes a number of scenarios, some carrying over from chapter to chapter, which aid in understanding the process for dealing with difficult behavior and the predicted, or actual, outcome. While the process suggested by the author may not work for you, and may not work in every instance where you are dealing with a difficult person, there is certainly enough wisdom and information to justify the time spent reading the book."
3,relevant,It is really a fictionalised documentary with little rom for drama or much exploration of themes within it to make it more interesting. Three stars but at least it is not trying to be more than it is. Yet it does hold interest and well acted. For anyone with a particuler interest and empathy for illegals or because they know of people in that situation it would be moving to watchSPOILER ALERTThe ending spoilt the documentary integrity in order to ensure a happy ending.
1,Best of?,"No ""Balls to the Wall"", no best of Accept. Period, end of argument. ""Best of"" the last 10 years is not a best of. Their heyday was in the 80's, and ""Balls to the Wall"" was their triumph. I might as well have burned the money. But I will say the seller was courteous and the product arrived before the advertised day in immaculate condition. It just sucks."
5,Flying Down to Rio,"Order came in excellent time and condition. Wonderful movie, bought if for my mother. She had seen it as a child over 70 years ago and never forgot it. It was a thrill for her to see it again and for me to sharein her memories. Truly brought back a time in Hollywood that was fun, glamorous and good."
3,Good but doesn't last,"Overall it's a good skull cap. It's comfortable and stylish, but my only negative gripe about this product is that it doesn't last that long (6 months max). Between normal washing and casual wear, the elasticity and the body fabric wear and eventually losses its strength and integrity."
3,Bought for Husband,I purchased this for my husband and he wore it once and said it was too tight. It stills on a table in our bedroom - unused.
3,Great fit!!,Great fit and absorbs moisture well but will prob need replacing annually.I picked up my next one at the underarmour store at my local mall.
2,Boring,The first 400 pages of the book were entirely predictable and not at all interesting. Cliches galore.
5,perfect order processing,"painting was ordered as a gift, what i enjoyed most was the order process (the list-box choices regarding size/frame), and how promptly the order was received, great job!!!"
2,Someone got paid a lot of money to make this movie,"I was so looking forward to this movie. Love Chris, love Dakota, but couldn't love this movie. It doesn't make sense, there's hardly any action, and frankly, it doesn't make sense. They tried but they failed. Please don't spend your money on this, rent it for a very low price if at all."
4,A sci-fi shot in arm!!,If you are looking for sci-fi action then this movie is a great way to eat 2 hours on a lazy Sunday afternoon. There are a lot of characters to keep up with and cool plot twists so if you go into this movie tired or you are unable to devote paying attention then you may become lost which usually ends up in a poor viewing experience. Nice to have a film set in Hong Kong again that wasn't a martial art flick. Kick back and enjoy!
1,Push,"Establishing a credible science fiction world -- especially one containing characters with super abilities -- is a tall order. Unfortunately, Push isn't up to it, squandering an intriguing premise with hyperkinetic pacing and a general lack of coherence. Chris Evans plays Nick, who has remarkable paranormal powers and finds himself on the run from unseemly government agents, including the dangerous Henry, who want to utilize his abilities for their own means. Despite director Paul McGuigan's visual flair, Push is really hard to follow, with a convoluted script and an excess of style."
3,Push,"OK Movie, However it is not plausable for a 13 year old (FEMALE) to run the streets of Hong Kong, noticed only by her fellow paranormals."
2,Save your time and money,"Wow where to begin. Whoever edited this movie really was a fan of art house editing. Not the good kind of editing but the really choppy, lets play around with different cuts and fading techniques and see how it turns out. Technical issues aside, the movies drags along save for the 2 or 3 cool action sequences. The last 30 minutes felt like an eternity, and to add to that, none of the plot elements EVER get resolved. Seriously, it was like watching a movie that planned from the get go on having a sequel. Bottom line, it was drawn out, frustrating, and with little to no enjoyment. Avoid this one."
3,"Cool idea, could have been executed better","I've been on a run of similary-themed movies: Jumper, The Speed of Thought, and now Push. In some ways Push promised to be the most intriguing of the three. And there were things about this movie that I loved. But...why is there often a But?...it sort of fell apart for me after a while. The action sequences were the best of the three movies I'm talking about, but the plot just started to fall apart for me. I ended up preferring The Speed of Thought (which also had a Kira in it!), because it was much more distinctive and unusual, even though it's obviously a much smaller movie without any major action sequences. But it constantly made me think, which this movie didn't want me to."
3,Eh...,"Superhero movies nowadays are popular and I am always happy for a fresh twist in the genre, but this movie didn't quite fulfill my expectations. It starts off pretty strong, but the storytelling is fairly spotty, and the ending was rather disappointing.You have people with various abilities that are given names - telekinetics are 'Pushers', clairvoyant people are 'Watchers', people who can heal are called 'Stitches', people who can become invisible or hide things are called 'Shadows' and so on and so forth. The idea had a lot of promise, but the movie simply fell short. It might be worth it to some people to simply rent for something different to watch, but it's not a movie I would want to keep."
3,Good Theme for Christian Leaders,"In a marketplace filled with books on sacred and secular leadership, it is a challenge to say something in print that hasn't been said before or better. While this title doesn't present itself as a classic, it does offer a different way of viewing leadership. Woods contrasts a successful leader with a faithful leader. The Christian's goal is to be a faithful leader, which has a biblical standard of achievement.If you are fairly well-read in the area of Christian leadership and are a Baptist, particularly an American Baptist, I recommend you read this work. If you are just beginning to read on Christian leadership, there are other titles by Hybels, Malphurs and Barna that would be much better investments."
1,"not a very helpful start, if you want to learn statistics","I am sorry if this review may happen to hurt the feelings of people concerned. But this book really is not helpful for someone looking to be introduced to statitics. Throughout the book, important concepts are introduced randomly, in disorganized way. The definitions are generally unclear and mathematics proofs hard to follow, the exercises excruciatingly boring. Is this statitics? No, this represents math teaching at its worst!"
3,"Intermittently interesting, but recommended nonetheless","Sleep Demons is part memoir, part discussion of sleep and sleep disorders by Bill Hayes, a self-described agnostic gay insomniac. I found both the memoir and the sleep information intermittently interesting: Some of the scientific sections came off as dry and tedious to me, and I wasn't expecting to read so much about Hayes's active sexual life. Of particular interest to me were his childhood and family life, and then later years living in San Francisco with his partner, Steve, who was HIV-positive and later developed AIDS. The first-person narrative of their life at this time was intriguing and touching, and was what ultimately made me glad to have read Sleep Demons. I'd like to have given it 3 1/2 stars, but felt 4 was too high for my thoughts on the book. So 3 stars it is."
3,We all have a child within us,"Chantal Goya stays a child forever,and brings a lot of joy to the children of the suburbs in Paris France. As a child i followed Chantal her sunday afternoon program,'L'ecolle d'enfants' where she would encourage children to sing along with her. Chantal herself aint no spring chicken,but she remains young at heart. She makes you go back to your childhood with this album,and makes you believe in fairytales all over again. This is Chantal's best album.from ALTEREGO in Tulsa OK"
3,For Collectors only,"Well, it is what it says: the Crystal video on DVD. The UK release did have some Reading tracks on it but only very short teasers. I would recommend the full length New Order DVD above either of the Crystal DVDs if you really want to get a feel of the band. If you want to complete a collection then shell out the cash for this one."
5,Work bench,"This workbench was all I expected and more. Assembly instructions were a bit vague, but we figured it out. The bench is a great place to mount a chop saw."
2,Feast Your Eyes On Jeff...Because Your Brain Will Switch Off,"My god, Jeff Goldblum is a fine specimen of manhood with his beautiful face, fine physique, controlled mania and wry way of speaking. But this very dull movie, filmed in an ugly fashion so popular during the 80s (very anti-art), with an absurd and tedious plot about some jewelry and a mysterious shady lady with whom our hero becomes entangled, leaves so much to be desired."
2,What is going on?,"I have been reading the Wingman saga since the first of the original books came out. I have always waited patiently and with anticipation for the next installment. Of the last three I can only ask Mr. Maloney this, What are you thinking? The Tommorow war continues in the alternate dimension that Hawk finds himself in, and frankly, the story line is getting really boring and tedious. Please put Hawk back in our dimension so he can go kick some Russian butt, or Nazi or anybody elses, but please get him back here."
3,NOT SATISFYING,After waiting ayear and a half for the next Wingman book I find my self disappointed and hopign that #17 comes out quicker than this one did(and there will be a #17). I hope that the UA goes and kicks some major Soviet butt in #17(assuming Hunter gets back to his own world).
1,"Good, but not good","And 1 mix tape 6 is good, but it is short, and focuses mostly on Alimoe. Mix tape 5 showed everyone behind the scenes and on the court, at many different places. Mix tape 6 showed all Alimoe, some hotsauce, and very little of anyone else, at about 3 different locations. Sauces crosses is tight, and **** up is fun to watch (mainly cus everyone is either falling or making someone fall). the music is hot, and I have to admit Alimoe has some bangin moves, but it's called THE AND1 MIX TAPE TOUR, Not the Alimoe Mixtape tour. they need more footage of the other players, I cannot stress this enough. It was good though, short, but good."
3,Not a Kool-Aid drinker,As a true Kiss/Paul fan it pains me to state that I got bored watching this. If you are a true Kiss fan you have to be totally honest. Maybe my expectations were set too high.
1,Boring.,"It's the usual: film a rock-star, on stage, with a semi-croweded room. People pumping their arms up and down on a floor covered with too-croweded people. It looks like everybody had a good time..but, on video, it's boring. The ""intro"" to the DVD is ""regular"", but the actual footage is shot in blu-ray (hint: you'll need a blu-ray player or HD player for this--my video didn't say that on the packaging)...Paul has a great voice (we know that), and he plays Washburn guitars (a rip-off design of the Les Paul called the ""preacher""), and his band ""Rock-Star"" is capable.But...it's boring.Save your money and buy a non-Kiss album...or go buy copies of Paul's solo-albums and give them as Christmas Gifts...but don't buy this DVD. You'll fall asleep."
1,Anyone else get a defective DVD?,I bought mine at Best Buy. It was the last copy they had. I took it home and the only thing I could get sound on was the title screen. Once I started playing it no sound. I tried it on other DVD players to see if I had a setting issue or not. Anway Best BUy took it back. I purchased online through them and it's still on back order. Which I guess is fine considering it would cost twice as much with shipping to order it here. I was just curious if I got a lemon or if it was a prdoction issue that others are getting.
5,SOUND PROBLEM SOLVED,"For some strange reason the dvd plays without audio no matter what audio option you pick from the menu. BUT, if you enter your dvd player menu and disable the DIGITAL AUDIO OUT option, you will have 2.0 sound coming out of the speakers. At least this worked on my Pioneer dvd player, which I have hooked to a convential stereo amp. This dvd has no real analog 5.0 or allows for downmixing to 2.0. It has either 2.0 OR a DTS 5.0 mix that will set itself by default -the reason that triggers the glitch- and probably will play only through a modern DTS-capable receiver, . Hope it helped."
5,Paul Stanley Rules,"As he has been doing for years, Paul Stanley completely transforms himself into a Rock God when he hits the stage, commanding your every emotion, and mesmorizing even the slightest fan into a totally engrossed captive voyer....His vocals have never been better and his stage presence never as strong, his stamina to work the stage and the audience, all the while tearing thru a set list of his newest tracks, and the older fan favorites.....worth every penny.....a must for any KISS fan...."
1,What Might Have Been,"This book was extensively researched. Unfortunately, the end results of this research is a very dry and somewhat boring academic study of Chinatown gangs. One feels that the author could have presented many ""real life"" stories of gangs and gang members. Instead we read about statistics and academic views. What a disappointment! I just wonder what a great book it might have been had there been more of a ""human"" look at the gangs."
1,Lousey remake,"As a huge fan of the original film this remake was going to have a hard time impressing me anyway, but this production was dull and almost unwatchable. The 'live TV' attempt adds nothing and it fact makes you appreciate the value of editing in films because unintentionally the actors step on each others lines, and background stage noise is evident in the film.I appreciate that they stayed true to the original story which was terrifying and gripping but the biggest diappontment are the scenes between the President and his translator. Done by Henry Fonda (and a suprisingly good) Larry Hagman in the original film, the dialogue between these two men is the high point of the film for me. But in this version with Richard Dryfuss and Noah Wiley, the scenes are totally 'flat' and undramatic.Bought this for $5 in a bargain bin so I have no complaints but as a film and remake of a classic this was a waste of time."
3,Tajomaru: Avenging Blade,The story line was good as well as the fight scenes. The actors played their roles very well and the scenery was superb.
5,Unintended Consequences,"I really like this book; it has a great story line and some unexpected twists. In particular, the book made me think about key chapters in history -- things we know happened, and take for granted the many supporting things that had to go right (or wrong) for the result to be what we experience today. I like the rattle Rohlfing gives us in that sometimes good things contribute to bad, and bad things contribute to the good...Not exactly what makes us feel warm and fuzzy, but perhaps makes us think more about unintended consequences of everything we do (or don't do). I hope Rohlfing will followup with more of these.....entertaining reads with lots to ponder."
2,Simple Living,"I love the Conran's shop in Japan. It's simple, but makes me fun. There are simple interior in this book. But less colorful, I felt something missing."
1,This is a BOOK REVIEW not an article,I downloaded this thinking (as it says in the title) that this was an ARTICLE. This was a book review. I didn't expect to pay $6 for some one-page stupid book review. I'm complaining to Amazon. That's ridiculous!!!
1,skeptical,I read through this book when it first came out and found it misleading. Many of the photos that profess to show clearcuts were actually the sites of catastrophic wildfires. So take them with a grain of salt. Bad examples of logging operations are unfortunately a reality. Clearcuts are not meant to destroy but to regenerate shade intolerant species that can't grow in selective harvesting systems.
4,my son loves it,"got great laughs, my pre-teen gets a kick out of goofy antics. juvenille but funny. perfect for my 13 year old."
4,"Incredible, but the sound engineer needs to be given a hearing test.","It really is a fantastic album, song wise, but what is up with the sound? It's tragic that an album as good as this one should succumb to something like poor sound. It's not even an issue of lacking polish...it's all mids, sort of like an MP3 ripped at 32kbps. The drums are so muddy sounding that at times they sound like they're being played in a room far away from the rest of the music. It does vary slightly from song to song, but overall, it's not good. I have to agree with the other reviewer who stated that Samiam are best with a nice clean sound. Listen to Clumsy, then put this in.What a shame that one has to go and f**k up a Samiam review by ranting about sound. But the upside is that the record is, indeed, another great slice of Samiam.Here's to band reformations, and hi-fi."
1,Total Letdown,"I am a HUGE Samiam fan. Last of all my friends to pay any attention to this band in years. Thought Astray was just so-so, with a few great songs and a lot of filler. Had a feeling that that was going to be their final record, and that it would probably be a smart move to quit while ahead. This new record is horrible. Recording is rough too. Jason's voice is long gone. Save yourself the money and buy any older record. They are all amazing."
1,Great idea that falls short!,"So excited about this. Received it as a gift and as I opened it, right off the bat I was dismayed that there is no plug in option! Then I actually tried it and unless you can hang it from your ceiling the images are too fuzzy and dim for me to see let alone my baby! Great idea...needs lots of work before it is actually a good product. Mine is going back!"
5,We Love It,My boy's and I play this Select-a-Show Soother everynight. I have a 4 month and a 3 year old . The power went out the other night and it keep everyone com. Great to put little ones to sleep at night.
1,Not happy,"I agree that this machine clogs up really quickly and has to be cleaned twice a week, and the job is not an easy one. It has too be filled way too frequently as well. If it hadn't cost so much, I would have replaced it by now. Do not by this humidifier."
5,"2004: El año del cangri, DADDY YANKEE, jo!!!!","A quien le gusta el reggaeton, este es un cd con liricas para pasarla bien y vacilar en la disco. Para mi la mejor cancion es ""dame caliente"" es super contagiosa y esta llena de energia que te dan ganas de bailar. Las otras canciones que me gustan son: ""gasolina"" que es la que lo ha llevado tan lejos, ""el muro"", ""tu aguantas el empuje"". En general el cd es un tripeo para pasarla bien, y tiene 2 o 3 canciones de critica social que siempre son buenas para balancear las cosas. Asi que apuntale otro ""Homerun"" a Yankee. Coming Soon, ""Homerun-es"" Vol. 2."
1,awful,This album was honestly awful. I thank God I started listening to Daddy Yankee's later work because his newer music is 100 times better! I'm honestly upset that I spent money on this CD
4,Question: How is Daddy Yankee like Phil Collins?,"Answer: He's everywhere. Would it be possible for Mr. Yankee guest on more tracks? I don't think it's possible.Here in NJ one can tune into WCAA 105.9 at any point of the day or night, and there's an 85% chance you're in a track where Daddy shows up.Any day now he's playing Madison Square Garden to a sold out show.And yet his stuff is good enough that he doesn't feel overexposed. I know just a smattering of spanish, but I have to say his charisma transcends the language barrier, and of course Luney Tunes' excellent work backs the charisma up.I've had the record for a while, had a bunch of MP3s before that, I listen to this record a few times a week at work, and it's not old yet."
4,Hot,"I have wanted this CD for the longest and i finally got it. It's hotter than i expected. This album is off the chains(Really good for those that don't know slang). The really bumpin songs are King Daddy, Dale Caliente, No Me Dejes Solo, Gasolina, Lo Que Paso' Paso, Tu Principe, and Sabor a Malao. Get this CD if you are a reggaeton fan and get it if you are a new reggaeton fan. This is hot for everyone. Get it and you will see."
4,A Christian Home,I heard the author talk on the radio about this book on the Family Life station. I bought it for my daughter and her husband. It sounded like it would have some good ideas on raising children in a christian home. I plan on reading it myself after they finish it.
2,Beware of ramped up reviews,"I enjoy westerns, Mitchum is one of my favorite underrated actors and, when it comes to movies I don't recall seeing OR hearing about, I am usually skeptical of strong reviews without the confirmation of well known amazon reviewers. This movie has a 'Top 500' reviewer and that sold me for an inexpensive bet. DON'T BITE!!You have to REALLY like Mitchum to justify this clunker. Maybe the issuers are building big reviewers just to take advantage of this kind of browsing."
3,good,"I had never heard of this Robert Mitchum movie, but it is pretty good and nice to have in my collection. Not a stellar performance, but if you like Robert, you will probably like this movie. Just beware of the marketers that Amazon uses to sell some of their movies."
1,Don't buy a SEISCO electric tankless water heater!,"We have owned two SEISCO electric tankless water heaters since 2008 when we built our home. Within 23 months both needed repairs. One leaked water, and the other stopped heating water. Since then within 11 months, we've had to replace the temperature probe two more times. The technician tries to blame problems on hard water. He said we should have replaced all 5 of the temperature probes the first time we had problems. So why didn't he send five replacements? It's hard to find plumbers who will work on them, so we are usually without hot water for a week by the time the part is sent. SEISCO says their tankless water heater can last up to 20 years, we would like to see it last longer than 23 months. Don't buy this product!!!!!Also, if the electricity goes off, you don't have a tank of hot water to use while you wait for the power to come back on."
1,Avoid this product,"Had an RA-32 for 8 yeasr. Then the housing cracked. Replaced it. I am ok with 8 yrs. The replacement however, only lasted 8 months before electrical failure. These units are really not reliable."
1,not working,"have used Stink Free on rugs and wood floors, product smells awful on its own and doesn't really deter my 4 Chihuahuas"
1,replaces one stink with another,"This product has a strong fragrance, which I find unbearable. It may get rid of cat urine odor, but it imparts its own stink to whatever is sprayed, and it is difficult to remove. Buy Simple Solution instead."
3,Boxing Nun - Ingrid Bergman,"The sentimental movie about a carefree Priest (Bing Crosby) who comes to head up a school run by Sister Benedict (Ingrid Bergman). While Bing got top billing, it was Ingrid who stole the show, with her wonderful role as a caring nun who is dedicated to the school and each individual student. The action is kind of slow but you can get through it even with Bing's minimal acting ability. He should have stayed with singing."
3,Heavy for Sure,"I received my Grotes in a very short time from Amazon. Definitely heavier than I had expected. I think my set may have been used and returned, however. There was a sandy material inside both the shipping box and the orange container box that held the 3 triangles. The container box was pretty scuffed up, the tabs that hold the container box closed looked as if they had been opened numerous times due the discoloration where the tabs bend. The grit was all over each triangle and I didn't have gloves handy so I haven't tried putting them together yet. I did unfold one but did not snap it together. It appears to do what it is expected to do. Something needed, but nothing to rave about."
2,Waste of money,"I was looking for good links for online activities, tutorials, and classes but found way too many dead links, pseudo 5 star sites that were sales sites, and too many Bible links. I compared a Google search for the topic headings and did much better than scouring the book for viable links. Don't waste your money or time."
2,Outdated,It's a great book but the links are old and some don't work anymore. If a newer version comes out I'll buy it.
3,"Budget-priced reissue of ""The Devil's Brother""","Laurel & Hardy's 1933 costume comedy ""The Devil's Brother"" is presented here in a slightly edited reissue version. The quality isn't quite as good as the original-release edition, but the content is enjoyable, with Laurel & Hardy in excellent form as unwilling accomplices to singing bandit Fra Diavolo (Dennis King). The three-star rating refers to this particular version, which suffers only in comparison to its ancestor. Completists will prefer ""The Devil's Brother,"" but casual fans and bargain hunters will find nothing wrong with ""Bogus Bandits."""
3,Too many corpses,"The first book (from the eighties) had a few corpses but this one has too many for my taste. Mostly bad guys but in too large numbers.Our detective is now 39 and does not drink as much as in the first book - alcohol is a poison, you know. Basically it is a love story with external problems to be solved by Elvis Cole. He, of course, delivers and, hopefully, everyone is happy ever after.Fairly good handling of serious race issues, as little I know about these thing from my own experience, his depiction of an LA black community seems to be quite credible. The main villains are white but a few blacks do a lot of killing. Kind of equal opportunity treatment.Looking forward to the next book, Crais writes quite well but his references to old movies or TV programs may become incomprehensible in a few years."
3,Hey Elvis! MYOB! What a disappointment.,Nobody hits a homerun all the time. This author and his characters are usually so excellent they can certainly be forgiven a slip like this one. Several times I thought the lead character's ego got in the way of evidence and common sense and when one especially senseless death occurred I thought--remember Elvis they asked you to back off! Skip this one and continue on with this first rate series.
2,Free... way,"The story of the book is simply good. You will twitch your lips sometimes, but you can be sure that you will know every freeway and every street in LA and surroundings and that is a loss of time while reading. If you keep out all driving directions you will have a book of 200 pages, definitely not the best book written by RC."
3,"Nice, but flawed design",OXO's design of this product is flawed in two respects: 1)It doesn't self-seal; you have to remember to click it closed after every drink to seal contents in. 2) The shape of the mouth area is a little tricky to match to your lips if you're focusing on traffic. Buy the Contigo ElleElle Contigo Mug - BlackElle Contigo Mug - Redfor a 100% successful execution of this product concept.
5,Tyler does it again,Another feel good movie from Tyler Perry. It has the serious moments plus the laughter that we look to get from Madea!!!! Must see and own movie.
3,Why?,I am not a Madea fan at all. But my mother loves this movie and all the movie. So that is saying something for them. I think the movie is stupid and there is not reason for any of them to be made.
2,Volume and subtitles,"This is one of my favorite movies and I enjoyed watching it. However, there is some problem with the volumes of the videos I play using Amazon Instant Video.Also, I would like to have the option of subtitles in the future.Thanks!"
4,Good Movie,"As always Tyler Perry delievers another solid film for the whole family. But the comedic level falls a little short of the other Madea films and plays in the past. Its a wonderful movie, but it doesn't quite deliever the funny as one would expect."
5,Fun movie to watch.,"Like most of Tyler Perry's movies it was quite comical yet delivered a message and all works out well in the end.It's a fun movie, but not for everyone."
5,Tyler Perry's Madea Goes to Jail,"After a high-speed freeway chase puts Madea in front of the judge, her reprieve is short-lived as anger management issues get the best of her and land her in jail. A gleeful Joe couldn't be happier at Madea's misfortune. But Madea's eccentric family members the Browns rally behind her, lending their special ""country"" brand of support. Meanwhile, Assistant District Attorney Joshua Hardaway is on the fast track to career success. But Hardaway lands a case too personal to handle - defending young prostitute and former drug addict Candace Washington and asks his fiancace and fellow ADA Linda Holmes to fill in on his behalf. When Candace ends up in jail, Madea befriends the young woman, protecting her in a ""motherly"" way as only Madea can. I have all of Tyler Perry's movies, and I think this movies is very entertaining. No one does it better but Tyler Perry."
2,"More Madea, save the melodrama!","The Madea segments in this multi-plot flick needed to be longer. I wanted more of Madea and less of the preachy melodrama madness that ways down what would otherwise be a hilarious comedy. Tyley Perry needs to lighten up. ""It's hard out here for a pimp."" We need the funny stuff to let us forget all the bull that is outside."
4,Kinda funny!,"Good movie! Not Tyler Perry's best to me.Good entertaining movie.Really needed to see more of Tyler Perry in it.But,a good purchase over all!"
3,It wasn't as good as I expected.,"From reviews I had read, I thought this movie would be better than it was. I look for Christian themed movies to show to a group of teens. This one, I think, had too much drug paraphernalia use displayed with no one saying anything about it not being OK. I think there are other Tyler Perry movies that are more consistent with my point of view and goals I set for what teens should be taking in. Maybe some people can view that stuff in a way that they know it's bad for them even if it isn't said, but many teens are not that sophisticated in their thinking. It was OK, but not nearly what I would call one of his best."
1,Ugh..,"I ordered this book specifically because it had the Valeyard in it, and really wanted to enjoy it, but it was just terrible. : The doctor doesn't know who he is for 70-80% of the book, and it just drags and drags and drags on.. And the Valeyard is handled terribly. Skip it, sad to say."
1,Not the worst ... but close,"By the end of the fifth page I already knew who the ""mystery villain"" was, and by the end of the thirtieth page I knew exactly how the book would end.This book picks up the most overused villain in the Doctor Who canon, strings it together with all of the usual cliches (the amnesiac Doctor, the evil circus, etc.) and tons of gratuitous continuity references. It's like the author just took all of the Seventh Doctor's TV adventures, put them in a cocktail shaker and mixed them up, and then poured the mixture onto the page.The only thing in this book that I haven't seen before in another Doctor Who novel or episode is the character of Joseph Liebermann, who I hope we see again. Aside from that, it's totally forgettable, and if you've already read a few of the other Seventh Doctor novels you'll be choking on your deja vu."
2,Do Not Read DOCTOR WHO: MATRIX,"I do not recommend The Matrix from the Doctor Who series. I have heard many positive comments about the series, but my short experience has disuade me from reading the others. By the first few chapters, I already knew how it ended. However I trudged through the large amount of remaining chapters.This unrealistic, far-fetched, imitation science fiction peice of so-called literature provided little entertainment and no challenge to the reader. The book was cut, dry, and boring.Included in this book were many typical characters such as Ace, the Doctors right hand woman, the Doctor, the main character who has to fight an internal problem, Malacroix, a crazed ringmaster and owner of a circus of freaks, and Ackroyd, the keeper of the freaks who posseses a boy scout attitude."
1,Wake me up when it gets exciting will ya?,"The first rule in Book Club, you must grab my attention within the first 10 pages or your permanently banned to the ""I couldnt read it"" shelf. This book is banned, A good author in the first 10-20 pages sets up the novel with good characterizations, locations, a good story line, and grabs the reader by the throat and says ""hold on lets go"" this one said to me ""wait a minute while I take a nap"""
3,Alrighty,"It was pretty good, it is different than other versions but good all the same. I would love to know who wrote it."
4,"The illustrations are fantastic, but the text isn't","This retelling of the old fairy tale adds deeper emotions to the story with gorgeous, jewel-toned paintings. The portrayal of the father as a broken man, the beast as a misunderstood animal, and Beauty as all that is selfless and good in pre-modern Europe follows the timeworn pattern. Although the text does not stand out among retellings, the framed, haunting oil paintings that accompany the words on each opening as love turns the beast into a prince make the text superfluous. The images are ageless, but the text I would recommend for ages eight and up."
3,Sweet.,"Sadly the story is on the short side of things but it is a sweet story to read, especially for a young or beginning reader."
3,Good but Short,"Warning: It is a good story; however, this kindle version is a remarkably short abridged version of the text. I got it for free, so I am not complaining, but I was unaware at the time of purchase."
1,Was hoping for more,"Vague. The Disney movie was darker than this edition. Going further, everything seemed rushed even for a short story fairy tale"
2,Exceadingly well written but philosophically childlich,"A very endearing, well written book. The story of ancient mathematics is fascinating, albeit nothing new here, but unfortunately from a philosophical and historical point of view it is very desapointing. To tell the truth that's philosophy for high school teenagers. Old math prejudice, fascination for the doing of one's self, misconception about independant culture, and so on and on and on. Hundreds of objections for each of author's proposition could be imagined. His holos is mainly hollow. A very desapointing book, but very well written indeed."
1,Next to useless because there are no sample files.,"This book is attractively designed, well-written, and nicely edited. There is a great deal of practical and clearly explained information. The problem? Mr. Beckham or Lark Books decided to not include samples of the photographs he uses to illustrate his tutorials. There is no CD and there is no website from where the pictures can be downloaded. This is unforgiveable in a book that presents itself as a learning text. Curiously, Mr. Beckham's website references a resource center for the book and refers the reader to a URL on page 4 of the book. There may be URL in the British version of the book (Mr. Beckham lives in England) but there isn't in the U.S. version being sold Amazon. This would be a five star book if the images were available to practice on. As it is, it gets one star for just being a pretty publication."
1,Complete Handbook of Known Information,"Although this book is informative for someone new to computer security, it tells no new tales for someone who already knows something about computer security.Almost all the other books have the same information presented here; some of the other books even present the information better. This is NOT a hacker's guide. This is NOT a manual for computer security professionals. This is a book written to earn the author some quick bucks.The author may very well be knowledgeable, but that knowledge was not presented here in the book.For a good security book, look elsewhere."
2,Not Worth it,"Leaves much to be desired. A few insights, but no more then can be gleamed from a well written magazine article. There are much better resources/books out there.But, If you are JUST looking for a MANAGEMENT level overview without ANY detail, it might have SOME value to you..."
4,A Star Is Born,A really great and fast read. I loved it. It's really well written and amazing frank and funny. It's a great book to take to the beach or spend a lazy Sunday reading.
5,Teriffic,"Captain Klutz is great. Sadly, my copy of this book (and of part II) was donated accidentally. Hopefully I can find another someday."
4,Just what I wanted,I was pleased with how well it matched other privacy screens I saw in department stores for much more money.
4,"Thin Jar, at a loss","Back to the order page a week after getting marmite for the first time. Obviously I liked it enough to reorder. For the uninitiated, this is a thin glass jar! I was making toast, marmite all ready to go, when small slight of hand sent the jar falling from a height of three feet. It basically exploded.I'm all for glass condiment jars, especially since my recycling facility only takes plastics 1 and 2, but this is the thinnest condiment jar I've ever come across. So be careful you don't lose your investment."
3,Yank can't hang,"I bought this just to try it out. It tastes like rotten death. Be sure to spread a very very thin layer if you're brave enough to try it. I guess it's a learn to love sort of food, such as beer. I'm not a fan, perhaps 30 years from now my palette will change."
3,Cute Vette Phone,"I bought this for my boyfriend who is a vette enthusiast. He loved it but for what I paid, I thought it would have been nicer. He collects Franklin Mint models and I was thinking it would be closer to that quality. Also, the connect button is on the bottom of the car and if you jar or knock over the car accidently, your phone goes off the hook. Otherwise, it's nice to add to your vette collection. ;0)"
4,Good book,"I originally bought this book for my 8 year old son. I read it first to make sure the content was appropriate for him. I was entertained by the story. I couldn't put it down. Towards the end of the story, the story line got a little hokey, but it was still a good read.My eight year old has yet to get excited about it. We may have to wait a year or so. The print is too small and the chapters are about ten pages. So, it was a little intimidating for him. I think he'd love the story when he finally reads it."
5,The Real Deal,"I don't normally take the time to review a book, because the time I spend reviewing could be spent in better ways (like reading another book). But this needed to come out. Brian Billick is a mastermind. I know that it's tempting for a business professional or leader of any other sort to dismiss this book because of Brian Billicks position. PLEASE do not. While we don't all coach professional football, we all have the same responsibility to get the best from our players. It's not about football!!! It's about influence. Discipline. Integrity. Respect. Understanding what drives people, and moving towards a common goal. As someone who's read, and continues to read, leadership and business books as a passion and a way of life, I can tell you that this book sits at the very top of my shelf."
5,love it,My daughter loves this DVD. She is 18 months old and this is about the only things that keeps her attention--she loves the puppies!
5,Dora - Puppy Power,My two year old Grand daughter loves this Dora and just loved this video. I didn't order it in time for Christmas but was very pleased that I did receive it in a very timely manner. When I received this video I was pleased that it was just as it was described. It was in great condition and worked well. We are still enjoying this video.
1,Could have been better,I found that this book was not very helpful. The 'storage solutions' seemed extremely unorganized and un-attractive.
3,Not for the average investor,I bought this book based on a brief review in the Economist. It was way over my head. I'm a serious individual investor with training in math but found the tone of the book to be fairly esoteric and of little practical use.
4,Cigarette Smell!,"Overall, the package arrived promptly. The condition was decent. My only problem was that the book smelled strongly of cigarette smoke! It was absolutely pungent! However, I guess I can't complain because it was so cheap."
4,Australian SF Reader,"Williams is evolving this three book series from a straight adventure chase story to something more philosophical, and towards something most definitely creepier. Her companions are starting to be other than what they seem, and a possible war looms.With enigmatic and a sometimes decidedly unhelpful artificial intelligence along for the ride, Roche must work out what the hell she should do."
2,Very disappointing................,"This CD could have been a good one, however, It was too Latino for me. The only good track was Hazy Rooms. All the rest sucked. Thank goodness I didn't pay much for it. Do yourself a favor, and forget this one."
5,"Scholarly, yet easily accessible to the layman","This is my second reading of this series. I own all three volumes in book form, but the Kindle version is so much more ""user friendly"" in that I could highlight text and easily take notes along the way. I was first introduced to Wright in 2004 by a colleague with a similar background. This series has been life-changing for me; Wright has had a profound impact on how I read the scriptures, especially the New Testament."
3,Worth reading if you know the area,"I enjoyed reading this book as I have hunted in the area for 30 years and have often stumbled across the decaying homesteads. I always wondered about the stories behind those graveyards of dreams and Raban has finally told the story. Parts of the story are very well told. I cannot get the image of the mother crying and praying for rain out of my mind. For this I am very grateful and I have purchased and recommended this book for many friends. The reason that I give it only a 3 rating is that there are loose ends regarding the families, some errors on the family histories, and a highly distracting leftist arrogance that runs through the writing. This is consistent with Raban making the evil railroads the great satan of the whole story and it also pops up in totally irrelevant ways. Residents of Ismay have told me that they refused to buy the book because they found Raban to be such a pretentious jerk. That may explain why he did not really finish the book."
4,"Good, but could be more focused","Raban is a talented writer and his history of the homesteading movement in eastern Montana is compelling and poignant. But like some other writers of popular western history (especially Ian Frazier), he frequently shifts back and forth between historical narrative and anecdotes about his own travels through the region. The families' stories were severe and dramatic enough to be told on their own (especially those of the heartbreakingly inept Worsells). Raban's own misadventures in eastern Montana seem trivial and irrelevant by comparasion."
4,More knowledge never hurts.,"As I am interested in the mechanics of musical composition, I find this is a basic tool in furthering my knowledge."
2,Wait... this is a Circle of Fiths,"Fat Cats Go Down Alleys Eating Birds.... This is the circle of fifths with a movable wheel. This same material should be in any basic concept of music theory and jazz chord theory.That being said. It is nice to have in a ""circular slide rule"" format like a color wheel and other ""wheel"" products. It gives someone not already introduced to the circle of fifths some insite into progression construction (I IV V , circle of fifths progressons and chromatic progressions) and other areas of chord theory.That's why I give it 2 stars insead of 0."
2,Kindle version is horrible,"I just bought the Kindle version of this book and honestly, the production quality is absolutely terrible. Although the content of this book is excellent, the Kindle version is very poorly produced. Major problems include:- Horrible images with illegible labels (you can barely read them even in zoomed mode)- Horrible text. The text looks like terrible OCR. I don't know what font they are using but the characters thin out and are cut off. Even at the largest text size setting, the text looks really badHonestly, I don't know how they are charging us $9.99 for such a poorly produced e-book."
4,Nice Presentation of a circle of 5ths and 4ths,Well it's just a nice presentation of a circle of 5th and 4ths that would be found on plenty of websites. However for a student getting into harmony and discovering these basic elements for the first time it could work. If it gets a student thinking about harmony and starting them composing around a 6 chord set and transposing into new keys - well it's done it's job.
4,THE VISUAL INFORMATION,THis book was purchased for my daughter who is doing music theory at the moment. She says that it is extremely useful due to the visual information conveyed by the wheel
3,Did not get a chance to use this book,"I purchased this book to get to know Word 2002 in depth, but my company upgraded to Office 2007 so I had to start all over again!! 8-("
2,Should be on a couch!,I was not too impressed with the texture of this comforter! I didn't even use it! It was so stiff and would have taken a LONG time to break in!
5,Love them and do not at all regret my purchase!!,"I was a little skeptical when ordering these because of some of the negative reviews but I'm glad I went with my instinct and got them. My baby's nursery currently has all cherry furniture with green/pink decorations and I wanted something that would make it pop so we decided to get white wicker baskets that would fit on her changing table and make it stand out. I was a bit concerned about the ""sticky and smelly paint"" that a few reviews mentioned but fortunately/lucky for us, mine did not have that problem. Mine came packaged nicely with no broken pieces and as white as can be and without any messy sticky/smelly paint. The sizes are perfect to put diapers, wipes, lotions or whatever you need at hand for baby and all three fit on the same shelf. (I've uploaded a pic) I think I may eventually decide to change the liners but for now we're going to use the ones that came with it."
2,CHEAP,"The lining is made of a stiff, thin, cheap material that doesn't even look all that great in real-life. If that was the only problem, I'd be fine with them, but the baskets themselves are not strong enough to hold more than a couple of towels; I bought them to hold bathroom products and look cute doing it, and they're failing on both accounts. I ended up using them to organize my bathroom closet, so that they'll be seen a lot less, and so the bottoms of the baskets don't fall out when I pick them up. I would never purchase such an item again."
1,mold growing on baskets,"I was very excited to receive these baskets in the mail as they looked lovely from the pic. When I opened the box, I noticed there were brown stains all over the linings. I removed the lining and I found mold growing all over. It was disgusting and such a health hazard as I was planning on using them for my baby's nursery. I requested a refund."
1,"disappointed, ideas not kid friendly","School, at home, where ever, paper bags and plates are two of the most commonly found item laying around. I thought the projects could have been more colorful and kid friendly. There are too many adult steps. I'd recommend ""Look what you can make with Paper Plates."" The projects are really cute, quick, and are more easily done by a child."
4,Never a dull moment,"I am currenty reading this book I purchased at a flea market in England. The plot is quite original and the characters are very real. The author does a good job of presenting the scenes and is very descriptive. This book is set in France and the fictitious island of Saint Roger. After suffering a hurricane, this island is hurting because its main income is through tourism. Trying to market itself again, the chamber of commerce devices a plan to throw itself in the spotlight by creating a fictious war hero and they hire a budding young beautiful actress to play the part of his mourning fiance. I wont say anymore or I'll give too much away. Anyways, check it out..its entertaining and worth a look!"
5,A Wonderful Tool,"This new book is a wonderful tool to use in getting your life back on track, whatever your issues might be. I will be recommending it to my clients and family as well as using it myself. It is such a simple process for idendtifying the roadblocks in your life that keep you from living life to the fullest."
1,Disappointed in Size Nine,This ring in a size nine doesn't come with the lighter middle section and trust me it matters. Don't buy a size nine if you need a matching set. Other than that it's a nice ring.
4,Not much more info.,"Not much more info than available in ""Climbing Anchors,"" by John Long. Mainly more pictures of various anchors. If you have a basic understanding of anchors, you can get away with not having this book."
5,Great Product,After seeing bad reviews for cheaper versions I bought this one. It's a really great product and works really well.
5,Love!,"These are exactly what we were looking for and exactly as described. The assembly was super easy (my 8 year old was happy to help out!) However one corner piece was made of a piece of knotty wood, but it so far has not caused any issues with the security of assembly. The benches are very sturdy, and have more than enough room for 2-3 adults, 1 adult and 2 kids easily.The packaging for shipping was enforced which was appreciated since the outer pieces of boxing were pretty banged up from delivery.Over all, we're very happy customers and would recommend this product to anyone!"
1,God Awful Movie,I am not going to even waste my time by telling you how bad this movie is.Here are a few things though:Gore- NoneZombies- one until the last 30 seconds of the movieActing- the worst i have ever seen..Tia Carrera is the lead actress...need i say moreEditing- please....Do not buy this movie...fan of Zombie movies or not.You have been warned
4,Dino Makes Way for Rickles' Lounge Act,"There are plenty of highlights in this hourlong ""Dean Martin Show"" compilation. However, the second volume is most notable for the 1967 preservation of Don Rickles' nightclub act. Mr. Warmth skewers a celebrity-packed audience for 20 minutes and delivers his classic Bob Hope zinger (""Why is he here? Is the war over?""). If you're a Rickles fan, this video belongs in your collection. Otherwise, you may want to purchase a better-rounded Dino volume."
4,very good,The DVD was in great condition and received in a timely manner. Gave it to my father for Christmas and was enjoyed by him and the whole family.
5,I Love this movie,"I think this movie is up there with Beaches. I just love it. The music, the acting, the story... all work wonderfully."
2,absolutely dreadful in spite of Midler's fine singing,"This movie is very boring. The main characters, played by Midler and James Caan, are both unappealing and unconvincing. Anguished yelling to convey deep feeling doesn't work in real life or in a movie. We somehow, also, were able to predict outcomes of most scenes. Fast-forwarding over a few scenes took nothing away from the adolescent story line. Good instead of a sleeping pill. Why did these fine performers make this film?"
3,A must have Bette Midler movie!,"The best of Bette in this movie. You've got her wonderful singing voice, her comedic acting, her serious dramatic acting....everything. This movie has all of what you expect from Bette Midler. James Caan adds just the right amount of talent but pales in comparison to Bette Midler. You've got to get this movie to add to your library."
5,Quality Product!,"this grate is very high quality at a great price. These same grates are $20.00 plus at Lowes and Home Depo. The seller is extremely customer service oriented.Pleasure to do business with.Thank you,Sally"
5,Excellent Pottery,"These are the greatest pottery dinner plates you can find. The color is brilliant, the plates do not scratch and they clean up extraordinarily easy."
4,"Cute book, helpful for toddler weaning.",Cute book. I'm in the process of trying to wean my 2.5 year old and this was a nice story/ introduction to help her understand and give her some time to process things.
2,Better for an older child,"This was a nice story but it was paperback so easily torn by a toddler. It was also quite long, an older child's attention span. The pictures were black and white so my son was not interested in looking at them while I read the story."
5,Gorgeous,I thought the ring was gorgeous and it fit perfectly.This was one time that a piece of jewelry surpassed my expectation.
3,Cute book for those of us in denial...haha,"This was a cute book overall. It had some interesting factoids about turning 30 and what it means to be a thirtysomething based on demographics and statistics in the US. It's meant to be funny, and it is. There's some funny witty stuff. I wish there'd been more factoids and useless trivia about stacking up but sadly more than half the book was about celeberties. It highlighted celebrity accomplishments by 30, and thier measurement to full potential at that age. There was some interesting stuff, but nothing really new in the celebrity section and I feel like that part if kind of been there done that with other books."
5,no ordinary outlet cover,"I wanted something unique for my library/media room and this fit the bill. Love the painting and now can incorporate it into the decor of my room. Nice quality, looks great!"
1,Noisy and inefficient machine,"Hello, I got this from Target, and I am highly disappointed. This machine produces audible noise (a grating sort of sound coming from the poorly designed fan) even when I am wearing earplugs. These earplugs eliminate 30 Db noise, so you can imagine how noisy this terrible machine is. Furthermore, even at the lowest setting in a small room, it barely turns itself off, ever, suggesting that it is highly inefficient. This humidifier is a joke, and the people who designed it ought to be embarrassed, whereas the people who let it be produced and distributed ought to be punished."
1,Incredibly loud,"I bought this on clearance from Target, wish I had seen the reviews here. I took it back the same day because it is incredibly loud. I don't know what they did, but the fan makes a terrible noise, and the low setting is only slightly quieter. I have aHoneywell 17000 HEPA QuietCare Air Cleanerwhich some people complain about being noisy, and it is dead silent compared to this thing.Aside from the noise it also seemed very likely that the filters would get moldy quickly, and the unit doesn't seem to have any way to detect whether or not there is water in it, so even when it's dry it will keep running. It also doesn't have a visible humidity readout, so there's no way to measure how well it's working.This product has turned me off to the Holmes brand name altogether. It this a fluke, or are their other products this poorly designed?"
4,Excellent book for what is was intended,"As an overview of the state of the security milieu, I thought this book was quite up to snuff. I could certainly see it's use as a textbook for an undergraduate level course on 'The Basics of Security.'"
5,An encouragement for hard times...,"In ""Finding Calm In Life's Chaos,"" Becky Harling guides the reader through some simple Biblical truths that sometimes get lost in the busyness and difficulties of day to day life. In the stories she shares, her honesty and sincerity bring to light some of the things we all struggle through. She also offers a reminder to see the bigger picture and rely on the peace and hope that can be found in Jesus Christ. It was a pleasure to read and an encouragement to me in my own life."
2,MTV Unplugged 2 - Disappointing,"MTV Unplugged 1 was a great album, that blended very well. Unplugged two just misses as a combination of songs."
4,"Great spoon, but cheaper elsewhere","Well, it's a spoon. It's a piece of shaped metal, and it definitely does the job. I'm a Barista and I picked up a few of these to help out here and there, and they definitely have made my life easier. The red caps will crack and come right off if you abuse them, but they're just for pretty anyway. My only gripe is I found these at Bed Bath and Beyond for less than it is here, and they're usually overpriced on their items. Otherwise, it's a great product."
4,"Nice Spoon, Uncomplicated","Haven't used it much. But it seems nice, and convenient, and exactly suited for what it is for! So well done. I like the twistyness of it."
5,Perfect Spoon for Deep Travel Mugs!,I bought this spoon to stir a 20 oz mocha in a travel mug. It works as I had hoped it would.
5,Great Introduction,"While some books treat ray tracing like a method for geniuses, this one try to demystify it. The highlights, in general, go into ""why"" and ""how"" to do. Maybe the best parts are the ""dictionary"" of ""ray-intersection"" formulas and mainly the practical outline of a real ray tracer. This book don't teach you to do a ray tracer for Hollywood, but it's a very good beginning."
2,Not for the Beginner,"I'll admit I know nothing about ray tracing and I bought this book in an attempt to learn. However, this book deals with the mathematical concepts of raytracing from an intellectual analysis standpoint. If all you want to do is ""make pretty pictures"" this book is not for you. If you want to write your own raytracing engine, buy it today."
4,The Art f Playing with Brushes,"This product is very versatile. It is so nice to watch and hear those old but young at heart and very experienced drummers playing and discussing at the topic. Their music and the art of playong with brushes won`tnever get old fashioned! Also that was a nice surprise notice that Mr Adam Nusbam and Mr Steve Smith are the masters of the brushes too. You will learn using this entertaining material, just play with that instructional play-along cd!"
4,Intelligent and beautifully written,"This is my first Davies novel and I suspect I started with the wrong one in the series; however, MANTICORE was a fascinating read. In this, David Staunton comes to Zurich for psychoanalysis with a Jungian therapist after his father dies in a very strange accident. (Boy Staunton, his father, died in an auto accident with an egg sized stone of pink Canadian granite in his mouth) You think we're going to get a payoff on the mystery, which we eventually do, but we first have to go through Davey's life and get his personality integrated. The descriptions are very rich, which is a good thing because the book is mostly narrative. Despite sounding tiresome, the book for the most part is interesting and an enjoyable and challenging read. If you are a first time reader of Davies like me, I would suggest you start with the first book of this series, FIFTH BUSINESS before you read MANTICORE."
4,america album here and now,"i was very pleased with this c.d after finding out about it on the internet,the last c.d i bought of this group was back in the early 1970s i like there folk rock close harmony sound o.k"
2,Only For The Hardcore Fans,"It is wonderful and long overdue to see contemporary artists like Ryan Adams, James Iha and Jim James acknowledging that America deserves to be far more than a guilty pleasure. However, their involvement did little to dissuade me that America has much to offer these days. Chasing The Rainbow is the lone exception. The other songs have moments, but the sheen of the overall production seems to erase the humanness that their better songs always possessed. The live bonus CD is a great way to encourage trial, but outside of 'Sandman' there isn't anything here worth a 99 download. No doubt, most Amazon reviews are by written by fans hungry for any output from their beloved artists; still, i have to strongly disagree with my fellow Amazon Americans. On the bright side, the Complete Greatest Hits is a 5-star collection that everyone should have."
3,I want to love this album...,"...I really do. Unfortunately, it's impossible not to compare it to Gerry Beckley's recent HORIZONTAL FALL, which is a remarkable and thoroughly wonderful listening adventure. By comparison, HERE & NOW disappoints. (I do love HUMAN NATURE, whatever that's worth.)"
2,Not quite the original America sound.,I bought this cd because my original cd had quite a few scratches on it and I am not sure how much longer it will last. I really didn't like this cd. True it has alot of their great hits on it but it is a much slower cd. I prefer the original more upbeat version. It is not near as good when they sing the songs slower.
1,Here and Now is certainly the case w/this album,"Boys, Boys, Boys, what were you thinking? I think you're caught in a time warp. Perhaps your venue today would be better suited to a smooth jazz group. Your voices, your energies, your whatever are here and now - nothing like they were when America first came into its own. Sorry. I would guess you've seen much better days. At least your voices suggest you've seen better days."
4,A Great CD,"Just picked up the new America CD. It is terrific. They have stayed true to the sound that made them famous and their harmonies are still great. This is a great ""sit back and relax"" CD. I especially like Walk in the Woods. Just a great feel good song about life. The 2nd CD of their XM concert is also a keeper. It shows that they also haven't lost their edge in concert. I have seen America in concert recently and they didn't disappoint. Now having a bonus CD of a more recent concert is great too. If you love America and or are a big fan of great music and harmonies, this is one to check out."
2,Not what I expected,I really thought this would be more of a documentry on the history of carnivals but it's really not. It is basically interviews with one sideshow circus group in Coney Island. Some of it is interesting but not what I expected at all.
5,Awesome Book for Strong Women,"This book helps dispel the belief that weightlifting will make women bulk up. Lisa Lyon shows you an excellent, modern weightlifting program that will help you create a beautiful, sexy, strong body. There are great photos in this B&W book as well as wonderful inspiration in creating the strong body and mind you desire. Really excellent book."
4,Good little book,"This book is full of wonderful ideas to boost your Intuition. However it is also a great book about how you think on a daily basis. For example: ""Magnetic Energy"" is about what you want to attract. ""If you're afraid, you'll attract fear; if you're kind, you'll attract kindness; when you're grateful, you'll attract prosperity.""My only problem is the book is smaller then I thought, I guess I better read book dimensions better next time. With that said is does fit in my pocket book."
3,Good but lost,This book really lives up to its name. I started it and then lost it. Guess I will have to keep searching.
2,Broke,"As I expected, the garnets of this inexpensive necklace are full of inclusions. I didn't mind, since a garnet is such a deep, dark red. No one would notice unless they held your necklace up to the light. It comes in a nice velvet blue bag.... Here starts my problem.... The second time I took the necklace from the bag, stones and pearls started falling all over the floor. One of the stands had broken. Sigh. Also, I thought the necklace looked cheap compared to the picture. But you might like it. Amazon is wonderful and easy with returns if you don't like it."
3,It's a shame,It's a shame that this band came out near the end of teh heavy metal era. For their 1st album it was very good. I would have loved to see what they could have done on their 2nd & 3rd albums while metal was hot.
1,NO GOOD as a birth control method!,"My wife wanted to use this method because she was tired of the side effects of other birth control methods. We were amazed at how the cyclebeads website claims that it is 95% effective. Well, we should have known it was too good to be true. Three months after using this product, being VERY mindful to use it correctly, she became pregnant. DO NOT USE THIS PRODUCT IF YOU'RE TRYING NOT TO GET PREGNANT! It's a waste (although I'm very thankful for the son we have now!)."
3,"A little behind the times, but better than many alternatives!","Cyclebeads is a simple & cute way to implement the Rhythm Method of the mid-1900s.The good: it avoids the physical & environmental damage, along with abortifacient nature, of hormonal birth control, as well as the ick factor and, well, barrier of barrier methods.The bad: it doesn't work for irregular cycles or lactational amenorrhea (breastfeeding infertile time) and has been completely replaced in most of the world by modern, systematic Natural Family Planning (which carries a 99%+ success rate).They're cute - but I recommend NFP or Fertility Awareness Method (just NFP repackaged for a new audience looking for ways to live with fertility rather than suppress it with drugs). Google it!"
3,"Handy and cute, not that mind-blowing","These are a good way to keep track of your cycle, but not much easier to remember to move the marker to a new bead each day than it is to mark on a calendar. I think it's funny that the 'fertile' days have glow-in-the-dark beads. Really I think you could make one of these chains of beads and save yourself some money, as long as you could do a little research and figure out which days of the cycle were the fertile ones."
2,outdated product,"it's a good idea and worked for us, but as others noted it's a very manual, and thus error prone, way to track this. my wife now uses an iphone app which is much easier to use and is also far less expensive.i recommend skipping this product and getting something digital to do this for you which will automatically track your fertility, estimate your next fertility, etc. if you have an iphone i recommend ""ova"" which is the app my wife uses. It is easy to use and has great fertility tracking and extra features."
3,"DIFFERENT STYLE, DIFFERENT FORCE","OF ALL PACO IGNACIO TAIBO'S BOOKS THIS IS HIS TIGHTEST. I'VE READ TWO OTHERS AND A PART OF A FOURTH THINKING ONE MAY BE BETTER THAN THIS, BUT IF YOU LIKE AN AUTHOR IT'S A PERSONAL DECISION. I WAS ATTRACTED BY A MYSTERY AUTHOR FROM ANOTHER CULTURE WRITING ABOUT A PRIVATE EYE IN THAT CULTURE AND IN THAT RESPECT SOME CLOUDS WAS A SUCCESS. THE DIFFERENT CHARACTERS, THE DIFFERENT SETTING. SATURDAY AFTERNOON READING."
3,Doesn't Last Long,I love the scent but it doesn't last very long. I will continue to look around and find something I really like AND that lasts at least a few hours.
1,Expired Parfume...,"When I received merchandise, it was expired...smell was bad and not what was expected! It was probably repackaged and sold as new? This product was long over its shelf life and should have never been sold!!! Company said they would look into it but I never got a favorable response and eventually after a month was able to send in bottle to merchant! Still waiting for refund..."
2,Just...blaaah.,"This movie, in my opinion, was just beyond cheesyIt insults the previous Poison Ivy series.The supposed manipulations & evilness in the movie was just lame & they did not convince me at all as to being evil. I just wasn't buying it at all. Jaime Pressly as Violet in Poison Ivy 3: The New Seduction, did so much of a better job then these broads. All this movie strikes to me is as if the characters within the movie saw the 'Poison Ivy' series with Drew & Jaime and attempted to be like how they were and make a ""secret"" society based upon it, basically trying to be wannabes....and epicly failed.Btw, the only thing ""secret"" about the Poison Ivy society was the fact that they didnt say crap about it in public, other than that everyone & their mama appeared to know about it. Horrible."
3,Its an OK movie,"Only purchased it because Miriam McDonald is in the movie, Movie couldve been a lot better. Ending is pretty much predictable."
2,Poison Ivy 4 - The Secret Society - Blu-ray Info,"Version: U.S.A / New Line - Warner / Region FreeAspect ratio: 1.85:1VC-1 BD-25 / Advanced Profile 3 / AACSRunning time: 1:35:08Movie size: 15,65 GBDisc size: 15,76 GBTotal bit rate: 21.93 MbpsAverage video bit rate: 20.22 MbpsDolby Digital Audio English 640 kbps 5.1 / 48 kHz / 640 kbpsSubtitles: EnglishNumber of chapters: 21Extras: None"
3,cheap junkers but fit the price,these are some cheapo junker tires. kept them around to use as a replacement in the event of my other tires farting out on me. good for this purpose.
4,Hold on-to your nose!!,"Alice in Wonderland in the sewers. Apparently there is an alternate world of whacky characters living below London's subway tunnels including ""openers"", lethal bodyguard adventurers, and the lost, confused main character (the guy next door) and a conman's con-man for good measure. Neil Gaiman's books are always an adventure. ENJOY!"
4,Definitely worthwhile reading.,"As long as you don't expect to be wowed by this little fantasy, I'm sure you'll find it a worthwhile way to spend an afternoon. The characters are nicely realized, the plot is engaging, and Gaiman is a master of dreaming up delightful, oddball creatures and goosebump-inducing villains. The plot twists were, at times, dissapointing....but that hardly takes away from the overall value of the story. Gaiman's just too darn good at what he does to let any minor mishaps detract much from the quality of his storytelling.Highly reccomended reading....and I beg you to check out Gaiman's other work as well."
3,Bizzare Nightmare,"This is my first Gaiman book and I didn't really know what I was getting into. I've seen the Sandman comics, but I'm pretty sure I never read one. To sum up the book ""Neverwhere"" in one word, I'd use ""bizzare"". It feels a little bit like a transcript of a role playing game in Vampire or some other gothic fantasy system. The characters are on a quest. 'Richard' is the newbie to the group who mostly follows along to be the dazed point-of-view guy. Gaiman makes a /great/ game master with vivid environment descriptions, but the characters are a little less fleshed out... I didn't feel attached to any of them particularly, and I wanted very much to admire the Lady Door but just couldn't. Gaiman could also be excellent at simply stringing together those vivid dreams/nightmares that you have at the edge of wake and sleep. An interesting read, but not really my personally favorite cup of tea."
2,Sorely disappointing to this Sandman fan,"Gaiman's ""Neverwhere"" spends most of it's 385 (in paperback) pages trudging the reader through a drab and dreary world of rats and sewage, which would be fine if there was a captivating storyline or alluring characters. There isn't. Richard and his main travelling companion Door are likeable enough, however this tale is almost completely devoid of the mystery, majesty, and sublime wonder which suffuses Gaiman's 75-issue Sandman epic. If I didn't know otherwise I would probably think this was written by an unpublished hack. In truth, the two stars is kind; if I could have given 1 1/2, I would have done so."
3,"An ""OK"" Story but Forgettable","This was undoubtedly a very imaginative idea for a story and I did like parts of it. However, it lacked one rather big thing that keeps me from giving it a higher rating than 3 stars - excitement. I just couldn't get excited about ""Neverwhere"" at all, though I desperately wanted to. It's okay, but overall, the story is very forgettable."
4,Well Worth the Time,"You may well find the story takes a while to get properly wound, but the ending most certainly makes up for that. If you like Gaiman, you'll appreciate this work. BTW, if you haven't already read 'Coraline', make that your next stop in the Gaiman collection; it's a story primarily for pre-teens, but a fine and erie novella for all ages. Both are highly recommended."
4,"Entertaining, imaginative, but not very complex","A very fun, imaginative book, that is easy to read in just a few sessions. The writing is excellent, and it is easy to get swept along in the story. My complaint is that it isn't a very complex novel. It is very linear, has no subplot, and it feels as if some characters or ideas were introduced, but not ever explored by the end of the novel. A fun urban fantasy, but not much more than that."
4,Best of Gaiman since SANDMAN,"If you enjoyed Lord Morpheus' saga, NEVERWHERE is just for you. Dark, dangerous and utterly fantastic."
3,"Good writing, but a dull version of Dungeons and Dragons","I've never heard of Neil Gaiman, but I took a chance on this author becuase I was intrigued by when I read the jacket. I thought it was going to be a thriller, but to my disaapointment, it turned out to be a fantasy novel, like something out of Dungeons and Dragons. I haven't read any fantasy novels since I was a kid and I don't read them now, so that's why my review may be slanted. This book would have appealed to me more if it weren't so weird and the characters weren't founded on some sort of role playing game, which I feel the entire book was. But still even though I didn't care for it and wouldn't recommend it, Mr. Gaiman is a good writer and I won't take away from that. Three stars is my vote. By the way I find it hard to believe that this book was a national best seller. It seems like everything you buy at the bookstore these days comes attached with that label."
3,If Dickens wrote for TV,"There's another world beneath the streets of London, populated by those who've ""fallen through the cracks"" of normal life. Richard Mayhew finds himself trapped in London Below, hunted by Mr. Croup and Mr. Vandemar, two deliciously wicked villains who like nothing better than killing (except maybe torture). I loved the start of this dark fantasy--the gritty settings, the Oliver Twist dialogue--but slogging through tunnels and forgotten subway stations began to wear thin, as did some of the characters. The story was adapted from a BBC TV series, which explains why it feels more like a screenplay than a novel."
4,A nice original book!,"It might be because I watched the first two BBC episodes of Neverwhere that I found the beginning of this book boring, but regardless I struggled through the first half of the book. To me it wasn't up to Gaiman standards. But in the later half of the book, it took off, and things started becoming more interesting, there were some surprises and twists, and it built to a nice climatic ending. So even though I struggled through the beginning of this book, the second half of this book made it for me, and I ended up really liking this book. It's no American God's, but it is still a pretty good book. And I will say it is original, so that was a plus. If you like Gaiman it's worth a buy!"
4,A must read for anyone and everyone!,Gaiman does right in my opinion regarding this book. I couldn't put it down once I started reading. I would definitely like to see it continued....
5,Excellent Fanatsy Novel,"I had never heard of Neil Gaiman until I read about him in ""Entertainment Weekly"" last year. I immediatelty picked up this book at the recommendation of the fans of the author.I couldn't put it down. Excellent read, very entertaining and worth reading over and over again. I have also seen the BBC Mini-Series, which actually came before the book, and recommend seeing that after you read the book. If you do it the other way around, you will probably be disappointed.After loving this book so much, I tried ""American Gods"". Was I ever disappointed. I guess you can't love everything an author writes. I am waiting for a follow-up to this magnificent piece we call ""Neverwhere""!! 5 stars *****"
4,I'm a new fan!,"A friend recommended Neil Gaiman's work to me, and I guess I've had my head in the sand, because I'd hadn't come across his name or works before. Neverwhere was the first of his books I read, and now I'm a real fan. It's a dark tale; a journey that opens your mind to the stuff of myths and nightmares. This is not a fast-paced thriller. It's more like a map that unfolds. You follow the highway before you, not knowing where it's going, but not minding the journey because it's so intriging. If you haven't read his books before, don't let the discouraging reviews stop you. Gaiman has a unique voice, and this is is truly a peculiar tale. The characters live in a parallel world that is a bit of Dickens, and a dash of Gollem. Neverwhere is a place all it's own."
4,Where's the Cheshire cat?,"This is ""Alice in Wonderland"" for adults. Gaiman has captured the magic of ""Alice in Wonderland"" and placed it in his book. The protangonist Richard Mayhew has stumbled into an underground version of London and it is chock full of colorfull characters, both good and bad. Gaiman's character is caught in a world that doesn't look quite like his own, but is connected. Magic rules here and there is a quest that Richard and his companions are on to defeat evil. The two man evil characters, Mr. Croup and Mr. Vandemar are delightfully evil, just like Fagan from ""Oliver Twist"" and they work for a bad guy that is posed as a good guy. they are trying to kill 'Door' with Richard caught in the middle with no idea how he ended up there. This is a delightfull read and is very fast. Nice job by Gaiman and is highly recommended."
3,"It's very good, but...","I enjoyed this book a lot, but I didn't love it. I read it after seeing the TV show, and that might be the reason why I felt let down. The TV show was better. The visual qualities of the novel went to waste after seeing them on the screen. It is a good read though and I do recommend it, but it's not one to take your breath away. I look forward to reading his other stuff to see if it improves."
5,An intrincate lacework of words and visions...,"This is one of the finest novels you'll ever read in the [dark] fantasy genre... although I feel I should not put it in that shelf only, for actually it is much more universal than that.I read this book (purposefully) during a trip to London, and fell in love with its accurate descriptions, its quirky references and its lyrical, haunting and also heartfelt prose.The story of Richard, Door, Jessica, Hunter and their friends is one of the best you'll ever come across... part epic, part gothic, part murder mystery, part tender love story and adventure... Neil Gaiman is a master of narrative and this book works as beautifully as his graphic stories.A must-read and a candidate for the ""To Keep"" shelf."
4,Think the subway is scary?,"Neil Gaiman's NEVERWHERE is a thrilling look at what life might be like thriving under the streets of London. His hapless hero is stuck in a boring job, pushed around by a maneuvering girlfriend and well on his way to a do-nothing life when he makes a decision to help a homeless girl. Then, he's whooshed off into another, subterranean world.It's a pretty nasty place, filled with ruthless criminals, dripping dirty water, sewer rats and all the rest. But it's also a world in which compassion and soul are worthy traits.Gaiman does a lovely job of creating Dickensian characters, which further display the lackluster quality of current London life.The ending is a tease, but still satisfying in its own way. NEVERWHERE is a wonderful prelude to Gaiman's better work, AMERICAN GODS."
4,Good solid read,The otherworldliness of this book reminds me of goethe's faust. The dip from our reality to another reality is smooth and therefore real.
3,Surprised to find this story...unimaginative.,"The most damning problem with Neverwhere is that the story itself is simply unimaginative. The setting is interesting (and could be the BEGINNING of something good). The prose is sometimes excellent, but most often plain old exposition (nothing inherently wrong with this). But the story itself is nothing special.Also, my paperback copy, with the attractive ""Big Ben"" silhouette cover shown in the description, was notable for the exceptionally poor paper quality and ugly font/typeset."
2,"Long, strange trip","This was my first Neil Gaiman book, and may be my last. While there were a lot of creative & unique aspects to this story, I found it disappointing.I can't classify the genre it would fall into, either. It's a little bit fantasy, but nothing like classic fantasy books I could compare it to."
3,"Don't have to readjust settings, but has torsional flex","These pliers work very well and adjust automatically (awesome!). They are a nice size, not too big, not too small. They don't BANG open when you release the tension. I think these are better than the old-style locking pliers that you have to readjust all the time.EDIT: After having these for a while, I noticed they have a fair amount of torsional flex at the pivot point when locked. Not great for tough jobs.I have the 10in version of this tool (non-needle nose) and that pair doesn't have the flex, so it's not the auto-locking action that is at fault. So due to the flex on the needle nose version, I downgraded my review from 5 to 3 stars."
3,DVD picture quality is worse than VHS,"I don't know how they managed it but the quality of this DVD is worse than VHS. I think it's because they jam packed the DVD with so many episodes. The resulting transfer is suffering artifacts from overcompressed video. We all know the original source video is crisp and sharp from watching it in syndication on USA network, Nick at Nite, etc. I'm hoping Paramount releases them on Blu-Ray in HD quality. Then again, they could suffer the exact same problem if they go cheap and jam pack the entire series onto on Blu-Ray DVD."
1,Don't waste your money,What a disappointment! You still need to use flour on the pin. My dough completly stuck to the rolling pin. My wooden rolling pin works better and costs a lot less.
