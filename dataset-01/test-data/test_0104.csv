2,Didn't work for me,"I purchased this to control my TiVo HD DVR from another room. Unfortunately, it doesn't appear this works with the TiVo remote. Even trying it with everything being just a few feet away, I couldn't get it to work. I suspect it must have something to do with the physical design of the TiVo remote, but alas, it was not to be. (Note, I haven't tried it with other remotes since the TiVo is the only item I need to control from another room.)I tried contacting the company a couple times to see if this was a workaround for what I'm guessing might be a common issue, but they never responded to my support requests.Unfortunately for me, I was on-the-road most of the fall and didn't get to trying this out before the 30-day return period ended, so I've got a useless remote extender taking up space on my shelf.The product seems like a nice idea. It's well packaged and they provide all the items that you would most likely need. Just didn't work."
1,Lousy Customer Service,"Next Generation Remote Control ExtenderI'm an electronic engineer and have set up lots of other remote-control extenders. My Next Generation Extender quit working after a few months and I've left two messages for Customer Service (they never answer their phones) and emailed them - but with no response. My brother-in-law bought two of these units and they have apparently quit working as well (I haven't personally inspected them.)The transmitter seems to work, i.e., the ""A"" red LED on the receiver flashes, but the receiving device (TIVO in this case) receives no signal - even when the extender is only a couple of feet directly in front of it."
2,Didn't work for my cable box,"Didn't work for my digital cable box, decided to use it for my big Onkyo receiver. Had to line up the infrared with exact precision to get it to work, not all that happy. Wouldn't recommend. It does allow my Onkyo remote to work without aiming anywhere close to the unit itself, so it does have some function."
3,ok,It did not work as advertised. Only worked when it is direct line of contact for 35 feet. I have tried other product with two units and It is working for me instantly.
2,Does not work with Explorer 8300HD,"Despite what people have said, this will not work on an Explorer 8300HD remote. I bought this damned thing expressly to work with my Explorer 8300HD from Time Warner. NOTHING. NADA. BUPKUS. I tried switching from A to B to C. Tried everything.The thing functions on my simple plasma monitor remote (that only has power on/off, input select buttons.) so I know the concept is sound. But the transmitter does not detect anything from the multi-function remote (Model # UR5U-8700L-TWY) that comes with the Explorer HD 8300."
1,Short lived junk,"After initially not working, this unit all of a sudden started working after a couple days. Then worked great for about 3 weeks although had to keep changing batteries every few days. Now it hasn't worked for months although I keep trying. What a pain walking around the corner for direct sight every time I want to use the remote. I'm throwing this in the trash and buying another product today."
2,Didn't work for me . . . but Amazon's return policy is fantastic.,"After reading the Amazon customer reviews on this device (it apparently works well for many people), I gave it a try. Unfortunately, it didn't work on my Time Warner cable box. Fortunately, the Amazon return policy is excellent, so I will try a different device (purchased from Amazon) when I receive my refund."
2,Intermittent results,"Bought this to work with just one component - a cable box in the closet behind the TV mounted on the wall - and, initially it worked fine. After a few weeks, the remote started having issues changing channels, etc. I have spent several hours trying different battery changes, moving the 'eye' and nothing seems to make it work better. Originally very happy, now, very disappointed."
2,Does not work with a Dish Network IR 5.0 remote,"I purchased this extender with the intention of using it with a Dish Network (EchoStar) Model 5.0 IR remote. Prior to purchase, I found no indications from the manufacturer's website nor the reviews on Amazon that this would be a problem. When I received the extender, I was unable to get it to function in any of the four AAA battery locations of the IR remote. The extender did seem to work fine, however, with several other television remotes. An incompatibility list for this extender on the manufacturer's website or Amazon's would save lots of time and expense."
4,Almost perfect,"Compared to the other RF to IR clickers I have used this is in another league. It immediately chameleons whatever device the little transmitter/battery tube is inserted into. All buttons on the clicker work immediately through walls. Range is good, and battery life is good. Only one downside, which is the tiny transmitter module wears out rather more quickly than one would expect out of a product in a medium price range. Had to replace the transmitter in about a year. There are replacement modules available separately, but have not reviewed well. Instead, I just got another whole unit and received the extra batteriies and other parts. Overall, there is still nothing around this good for the price."
5,Easy assembly,"Nice little think that came in a blister pack. The hardest was to take it out of the package. The rest was very easy. Worked the first time.Due to the location of my TV antenna I had to place the DTV converter away from my TV. Was looking for Remote Control Extenders and found this. Was a little suspicious at first, but it works OK.Now I can watch DTV without having to go to the next room for channel changes.:-)"
5,very happy with purchase,great buy and works great. So simple yet solves so many complex problems. Range is incredible. I can be 100 feet away and still have flawless control over all my components.
2,Be careful what you wish for,"This remote extender seemed to be everything I needed, I was very pleased the way it worked at first. I have 3 tvs hooked up to the same satelite receiver and it was the best solution, until one of the batteries went dead. At that point I tried to charge them in the selected slot. All was well until I tried to use the remote with the same regular batteries it originally was intended for. It does not work at all without the extender set up, even with new batteries and the extender unit completely unpluged. So this device screwed up my remote control, it ruined its insides somehow {frequency ? }. I had to buy a new remote, and throw this device out."
5,Control extender,I have been using the Next Generation Romote Control Extender for several months now and find it reliable and dependable. I use it to control the Dish network receiver in the living room from the bedroom and have not had any problems with it.
5,Best invention ever,"I plugged it in, it worked perfectly, and I LOVE it! This thing has zero lag time and just plain works. After getting spoiled by my PS3 RF remote, I knew I had to duplicate this experience with my DVR and other components. I use this with my DVR universal remote and it works great."
5,"Innovative, yet simple and flawless!","This is an amazing product if you are looking to clean up your family/entertainment room and hide your components in a closet or other room. I have existing IR controllers for my AVR and my DVR. This product, along with the purchase of an additional transmitter, allowed me to put my components downstairs and use both existing remotes while saving lots of $s as opposed to buying a high end RF remote/receiver. Would recommend over and over! Most important...made the wife happy that it actually worked!"
1,This Product Is Lousy,Tried everything and NOTHING would fix the problem of the remote not working from a distance greater than six feet. Pointing at the flying saucer or the IR sensor - NOTHING. Would NEVER recommend this product.
5,excellent product,"using it for a TV in an upstairs bedroom while controlling the STB downstairs. No delay on the signal at all.The only negative i can think of is that it picks up other RF signals from other RF remotes, like a Belkin remote. So, I wish that it had a channel selector to avoid interference. However, I barely use the Belkin RF remote, so its not a big deal to me.Other than that, this is a great product."
4,Works Great,"This product worked great for me out of the box. I have bought two of these. One of them about a month into operation I needed to put the IR from the controller to my cable box, it was working without at first. Battery charge last approx. a month and then I switch it out with the spare battery from the controller. I recommend this product. I use it with a verizon cable box and a sony lcd tv."
4,Easy to setup and great range.,"Everything works as expected with this device. Only negative I have experienced in the 3 weeks that I have owned it is the rechargeable battery life. I use this remote in our bedroom and therefore it is only occasionally used, but I have already had to switch out the recharged battery. The good thing is that it comes with 2 rechargeable batteries, but it's just the small inconvenience of switching it out. Otherwise, this is a must get if you are looking for remote extender."
4,Didn't work with Pioneer SC-05 receiver remote,"Works fine with my Roku box and Pioneer DV-588 DVD player. Didn't work with my DirecTV HD-DVR, but then I discovered that it already had RF capability. That leaves my new SC-05 receiver, which I could not get to work with this device."
2,Doesn't Work With Logitec Remotes,I have a Logitec (Harmony I think?) remote and this didn't work with it at all. Not as sure about other universal remotes. Got a wired extender instead.
2,Not for going through exterior walls,Running remote TV mounted outside from cable box that's inside upstairs. Line of sight maybe only 20' with one wall to go through. If I stand on one leg and hold the remote in exactly the same position every time it works. If your inside with no walls I suspect it works fine. Would not recommend for trying to get to work through exterior walls.
1,Disappointed,"I cannot control our television from my chair in our family room. We purchased this in the hopes that I would be able to stop complaining about not being able to control the tv from my chair. Well, it was awesome for about 4 weeks and then it just stopped working. We have recharged the special battery and it has never worked like it did the first 4 weeks. We get maybe a day or two out of it now. I am so bummed."
4,Very Good,"I loved this book. Like all Star Wars books I read, I could barely put it down. The only reason it's not perfect is that the whole Star Wars series is very loosely based on science, so this book really has a very shaky fundamental basis. The fact that Jeanne Cavelos can write a great book around this weak foundation, though, is a testament to the skill with which the author writes."
3,"Great if you like Russell, interesting otherwise.","Ken Russell is kind of like stinky blue cheese: you either like him or you don't. If you like him, Salome is an essential work to add to your collection.Russell tends to hit you over the head with his hidden meanings, and this is one of the few films where he decides to let the images do the work for him, mostly by sticking close to the text of Wilde's original play. This is to his credit. The production design is lush, the photography surprisingly brisk, although his camera movements (as always) are just plain amateurish.Imogen Millais-Scott turns in an astonishing and bracing performance as Salome (interestingly, she never worked in film again) and Nicholas Grace (Brideshead Revisited) turns in a somewhat boring Oscar Wilde.I don't think I would buy this if I wasn't a big Ken Russell fan, but if you're learning more about this, er, interesting director, this is a good film with which to start."
2,Mind the aspect ratio,"I bought the Italian issue (L'Ultima Salome) recently and was disappointed - should have known.. when the aspect ratio's not listed in Product Details, you're gonna be sorry.This one's 4x3 so it's not the full quid (1.85:1 according to IDMB.com).The movie deserves 4 stars - great performances, good humour and even a cameo by the director - and the transfer looks OK; but this disc gets two stars only. Wait until someone does it justice."
5,Satisfied,I was very pleased with the condition of the product. It was exactly what I expected and nothing less.
5,Hezekiahs ministry is touching the nations,Brother Walkers music is for the purpose to touch the nations.As a born again believer this music has encouraged me to realise that I can live above the pressures of this life.Hezekiahs ministry has touched my life and I pray to God that 'my brother' you wont lose heart but youll love him even the more and be a blessing to the nations trough your music
4,Does the job,"It is a bit complex to assemble, to install and uninstall. Parts don't hold together when disassembled and stored. It is very easy to loose the small pieces of it. But as a ski rack, it does the job perfectly."
3,"A tedious romantic drama in the ""Casablanca"" vein but with none of the magic...","Bogart seemed destined for a painful end as he plied his despicable trade in a tale set in French-occupied Damascus around 1925...Casting his lot between the French and Syrians, depending upon which suits his own greedy plan most profitably, he earns the enmity of both sides...There were good supporting performances by Lee J. Cobb, thumping his desk as usual as a French colonel, and Everett Sloane as a volatile general, but the film was of little consequence and a sorry end to Bogart's solo production credits...""Sirocco"" remains a tedious romantic drama in the ""Casablanca"" vein but with none of the magic..."
4,Pumpkinhead,"Pumpkinhead is one of those great ""B-grade"" movies that doesn't come along every day. I first saw quite a few years ago and was thoroughly impressed by the super atmosphere of it! It is sooo creepy. The old crone/witch out in the woods was stereotypical but the best I have seen. Who doesn't love Lance Henrikson - this is his best format. The story is probably told a thousand times before in many different ways but the special effects and the overall ""spookiness"" make up for any shortcomings. I highly recommend it to any ""die-hard"" horror fans - trust me, you will love it. The ""Alien""-like creature looks a bit familiar (due to the Stan Winston factor) - but he brings a bit of a new ""deep-woods boogeyman/creature"" element. The acting isn't superior but what do you expect in this type of movie? Like I said, don't just rent it, BUY it, cause anytime you feel like creeping yourself out, throw it in the VCR and go. You will not be disappointed."
3,Its alright,"Plot: A father and his son live alone together and run some kind of store out it the country. Some 'city people' show up and one accidentely hits the fathers son with his motorcycle. The father wants revenge and goes and hires some witch to conjure up this demon called Pumpkinhead to kill all of them but gets more than be bargained for. He starts to have some kind of psychic connection with the Demon, then when he figures out how bad he screwed up he tries to kill it himself.The atmosphere is good. Very eerie, Good use of colors, perfect movie to watch on Halloween. Only reason I give it 3 stars is cause im not big into monsters but its really like 4 stars for people who like that stuff. If youre into monsters and fairy tales and stuff like that youll like this one. Its more a kids type of movie to me. Overall, it was a good story but nothing spectacular."
2,"Allot better than it looks, but thats nothing to brag about",A demon called pumpkinhead is resurrected by a witch to bring justice to a group of teens that ran down a farmer's (Henriksen) son. A few spooky climates makes this movie watchable. But is let down by the usual plot of teens running around screaming. Although much better than it's sequel.
2,Thumbs down!,"Ed Harley (Lance Henriksen) witnessed Pumpkinhead when he was a boy in 1957, mental note taken. Now (er, 1988, anyway), he runs a general store, and has a boy, Billy. Ed is a widower, but is that an excuse to be an incredibly irresponsible parent? He leaves 7-year old Billy in charge of the store and his dog. Billy is subsequently hit by a motorcycle. Ed comes back to find him on the ground. There is no phone at the store (?!), so Ed picks him up (error), and takes him home (another error) to cure Billy with a damp cloth (huh?). Guess what? The kid up and dies. You know the rest of the story; Ed seeks a decrepit old woman who can conjure up Pumpkinhead for revenge on one guilty kid, and several innocent ones. I know, who ever said horror movies had to be fair? But to be frank, Billy was just a victim of flat-out negligent parenting."
4,Revenge Has a Price Ed Harley!,"4 1/2 Stars = Minor MasterpieceFor demonic monster movies, it does not get much better, or more atmospheric than this story of revenge & regret.Directed by special effects, make up artist wizard, Stan Winston. The special effects are superior, & the monster terrific! Much more so than it's budget would suggest. It does not hurt that one of the most underrated actors of his generation, Lance Henriksen, stars in the role of the grieving father, wanting revenge for his son's death, & finds out the price is much higher than just his son's death, but his own soul."
4,Fun,My 4 year old loves Puzzles. This was a challenge for her and was a all family project to complete.
5,20 Questions=20 yearsof fun!,"This game is so much fun, I've played it with everyone, including a cop on the side of the road while I had a flat tire and waited for AAA to come change my tire. This little gadget is very durable, can be played over the phone and just everywhere!"
5,I love this product,"This product is fantastic. Used daily, I have been able to avoid a 2nd back surgery within 2 months. The workout is easy, short and gives great relief. Highly recommended."
5,A Great Improvement,"I have recently purchased this CD and listened to it dozens of times. I feel that this music is a great improvement over These are the Vistas. Each song on this CD has more personality than the variety of songs on TATV. I will agree that many of the songs seem to be similar upon first listen. However, the songs that immediately stuck out in my mind were Velouria and Iron Man. A modulation to major (In Iron Man)? Amazing and original! I highly recommend this CD, but you may want to listen to it a few times until you hear the personalities of each song. I feel that The Bad Plus has a long way that they can go and they are nearing their peak. Is this jazz? No, not in a textbook sense. But it demonstrates great improvisation with many jazz techniques. Trying to label this music is pointless. Just listen to it!"
5,Great read!,"After wanting to read this book for several years, I finally bought it ~ and was immediately sorry I'd waited so long. It's a fun ~ and funny! ~ story that will, or course, appeal to birders, but which also gives non-birders a look at one aspect of birding. Even my recalcitrant husband, for whom birding is one of the stranger things I do, laughed out loud at some of the anecdotes.The movie was excellent as well; but read the book first. While casted perfectely, the movie gives a somewhat slanted view; non-birders might be led to believe that an expensive Big Year is a pursuit ALL birders participate in. For many birders, a ""big year"" is just about seeing how many birds we can find for ourselves in a calendar year. The concept is a broad continuum of distances traveled, money spent, and time committed."
5,I'm not a birder...,"...but I loved this book! I am fascinated by people who are exceptional at anything, and the three men profiled in this book are talented in the extreme. That they were also willing to take a whole year to be away from their families, spend thousands of dollars traveling thousands of miles, eat terrible food, endure horrible weather and make themselves ill makes ""The Big Year"" even more interesting. Others may find them crazy, but I admire them all. The amount of research that the author put into this book really shows, and his concise writing style kept my attention from beginning to end, even though the names of the birds meant little to me. A fun read."
4,Fun anti-terrorist effort,"This is an entertaining anti-terrorist flic that will give a feel good outcome emotion. Of course the premise is implausible and the military brass are inept, but the chainsmoking senator is the embodiment of why our nation is in trouble. Big Steve is great (as long as he doesn't preach his environmental stuff) and Katherine Heigl is a beauty at a very preTV role point in her career. Eric is a despicable villain and his end justifies his crimes as well as the mercenaries and their leader. If you like trains and want to see them smashed, this is the movie for you."
3,The movie is okay,"I personally thought the movie was one of those movies with no point to it other than just explosions and bad guys. Still, I would recommend watching this movie because it will keep you in suspense through out most of the movie."
3,Wished it worked better.,"I bought a bunch of these rhinestone iron ons for my self and my bridesmaids. I did the bridesmaids shirts first and they all worked perfectly. This one however, some of the adhesive wasn't on the rhinestones when i opened the package therefor I was not able to iron them all on. I just wish it worked like the other ones I had bought. The rhinestones that did adhere stayed on though."
2,More work than advertised,"Fiance was gonna use this for her shirt after our wedding. After the transfer, quite a few of the stones didn't stay and had to be glued on with fabric glue. She got a little glue on the shirt, tried to scratch it off, and made a small hole in the shirt. The shirt ended up in the trash. Wasn't a good day for the already stressed soon to be bride. Anyway, be prepared to glue some of the stones on if you buy this. At least it was relatively cheap..."
2,Not a very good product.,The clear tip separates from the colored part on these replacement tips. All four of them have broken. They are a Poorly made product.
1,water pik,I received this item and 3 of the 4 piks came apart on the first use. I requested a replacement and it was shipped to me immediately and with no hassle. I havent opened the replacement shipment yet.Water piks for me are the best way to keep gums and teeth healthy along with brushing.
1,"Think twice - great price, terrible quality","Do not be tempted by the low price. I ordered 7 role playsets for a birthday party. 4 arrived damaged. The helmet is very stratched when it arrives in the box. Poor packaging both for toy and shipping. Easy to get replacements sent in time for party, if you like contact with a computer NOT a real person. Of the replacements 1 was damaged on arrival. I now have the inconvenience of shipping at least 4/5 of these playsets back. WOULD NOT ORDER AGAIN."
4,"Very warm, just a bit too tight","This bag does an excellent job of keeping you warm but you may find it hard to move inside it. There's no space to bend your knees, never mind reach your feet to take your socks off when you get too warm, which will happen. I am of a slender build, so the size of the bag might be a deal breaker for people of more substance. Wenger's other bag with a weaker warmth rating offers more room and hence more comfort."
1,"Spare the child, use the rod on Dobson!","This book masks a Christian stance and advocates violence and oppression against children. In one passage, Dobson recommends ""a few sharp slaps to the leg"" of a cranky toddler on a plane! AS if THAT will solve anything. JAmes C. Dobson obviously knows nothing about developmentally appropriate behavior in children. He seems to think that asserting yur authority and submissing children into fear is the way to raise happy children. I THINK NOT! Kids certainly need (and want) limits, but they need limits to be set in a way that they understand. Furthermore, children must be respected if they are going to develop self-esteem, which is the REAL basis for self-conrol and discipline from within. Dr. Dobson, What Would Jesus Do?"
5,Love this swing,"Our baby loves motion and had bad colic for 2 months. This swing was a lifesaver and our daughter loves it. We do not use the attachment with the toys because they didn't captivate our daughter at all. The music is indeed loud but we took another reviewer's advice and put tape over it which made the volume much more pleasant. We love this product and don't know what we would have done without it. Amazon, thank you for shipping this larger item to a military APO address."
3,power plus szing,i lik e the swing because you can plug it in but if the baby kicks to much or moves aroung the swing will stop but i do like the swing but i bo not believe it is worth the 80.00 that it is listed for
4,Old book but still useful,"Though this book was written in 2001 for CE3.0, lots of materials still apply to CE5.0. Just need to skip the parts for CE3.0."
1,"Great idea, lousy install & support","I purchased this for my 2nd grade daughter to use on our Windows 98 computer. The install completes with a FileIORoot error, and fails to start up when you launch the program.I spoke to tech support, which was of ABSOLUTELY NO HELP! The answer I got was ""We have over 80 products, and can't be expected to support them all."" Great company, huh?I've installed other Jumpstart products in the past and haven't had too many issues. Tech support has always been their shortfall. The knowledgebase on their web site didn't even list this product. I'm sure others experienced the same install problem, yet a search on the specific error message returned nothing.I think it's time to look elsewhere for educational software, especially when you can't get help installing their product.Dean"
1,One of the worst math books ever,I purchased this book two years ago and I expected it to be great but it's really not that great of a book. When you do the problems it has the answers right under the problems.
2,HP gone way downhill,"I had an HP LaserJet 4MP for about a decade before it finally went. I doubt that I will get that kind of service from this machine. I also had a Xerox b&w WorkCenter for copying that went about a year later. same concerns. i got this primarily to replace the copier. With this HP the toner cartridges go in no time. The scanning is slightly askew, and there is some color distortion. Also, the scanner utility is pretty inept. The print drivers do not function properly, preventing my up-to-date Windows XP from going to sleep mode. HP was once a symbol of dependabilty."
1,Towel Warmer,"This towel warmer leaked oil on my carpet. When I further researched the product I did find a unit which had an electric element without oil which did not leak oil at a lower price. I purchased this product at Bed, Bath and Beyond for [$$$] and it works very well keeping my towels very dry and also warm. It heats up more quickly and more evenly."
4,The Given Day,"Dennis Lehane is a master storyteller even when he used serial detective as his genre and when he turned to pedophilia in Mystic River or fantasy in Shutter Island. In The Given Day he tackles the animosity that existed in the city, between members of the police department, and between the races.Since he appears to relish every word he writes, readers need to read carefully for hidden possibilities and any twists and turns in the plot. If someone wants a quick read, this book is not it as it requires close attention to characters and the wait for back story between some characters. He does an excellent job with his portrayal of Babe Ruth at the beginning in a racially tense scene.He has expanded so that he cannot be pigeon holed as mystery, fantasy. He is about capturing relationships and showing the twists and turns. He performs this task well and with realism"
1,Shallow,"Weak plot and characters. The author is obsessed with using the ""f-word"" which adds nothing to the novel. The history of the rise of the labor movement in America is far richer than it's portrayed in this book."
1,why not the whole book,I recived this last July and finally read it in Dec. got to page 691 and that page was glued to the back cover. never got to read the last 30 missing pages. never found out about Babe Ruth going south.
3,Pretty good,"I enjoyed the story, and I thought the book showed significant insight into some historical figures that is not always revealed through placid biography. I was not a fan of references to Babe Ruth, although some readers might have thought those parts were the best. The Coughlins are not your typical family, and I liked that Ellen, the wife, was very strange, and appeared to have some sort of mental illness. Book had very strong characters - they were smart, but not superhuman and credible. Book features real evil, and how pain can turn into evil. Story about the Boston Police Strike, the mayhem and the reasons behind it."
5,Gripping,Lehane is a gifted story teller paticularly when dealing with his Bostonian cast of characters. Tough stuff but a great story line
2,Awful. Bloated and Boring,"Ugh. His earlier books have been so full of tight pacing and spirit and relevance. But this one invites the flip-through of -- no exaggeration -- half the pages as totally irrelevant to what is meaningful in the book. Dialog is slack. Context is beaten over the head until you are numb with it. And what is the context supposed to be? It feels like a historical novel he wrote because he felt he had to, not because it was meaningful to the present day.The only salvation is the main characters, who are well drawn and complex.But that is dim salvation in a grossly overwritten book like this one. Buy all of his previous books, but save yourself on this one."
2,A little boring...,"I agree with the reviewers that said the book was boring and could have been shorter. After I read it I was surprised at how many good reviews it received. I am not hard to please. Give me a good story that keeps my interest and I am happy. I love historical fiction but I was so close to giving up on this one after about 150 pages. Literally, nothing was happening! It took about 200 pages for the lives of the 2 main characters to intertwine! Ridiculous! I got through the book but I would not recommend it to anyone."
4,Illuminating,"I read quite a bit of history but didn't know much about Boston in this era. I have a much better feel for it now, and it's a pretty enthralling period. The characters are real people, the story is good if a bit long, the writing fine. Something goes wrong with turning manuscripts out as e-books; a LOT of typos can get distracting."
3,"Great author, book kinda dragged.",A good slow at times story...the character Danny seemed a little over the top and unbelievable. I enjoy stories about Boston and the Irish story. I got tired of reading about the Boston Police Department. With so many characters it's hard to remember who is who. Still Dennis Lehane is one of my favorite authors and I finished it because of that.
3,Didn't hold together,"""The Given Day"" started off strongly with good character development. However, as the story went on (and on) the author had to rely on way too many coincidences. I've lived within 30 miles of Boston all my life (except for the service and college) so this help added a lot to the book for me, but I think the author just pushed beyond his skill at holding a story together. He is a good writer, but...All in all I think the book is a good read or I wouldn't have given it 3 stars, it just stretches credulity too far. I've found his other books better, maybe because the stories were more compact. He may have a great 700 page novel in him, but this wasn't it."
4,Perfect for Professional Use,"This is a great product, and I got it at the same price here as I would have anywhere else online.If you are in culinary school, I would recommend you shop around at local stores first since they often have student discounts you won't find online.If you are a home user, I would recommend buying an informative book on knife care so you don't destroy your stone/blades while trying to make them sharper.My only knock: be very careful with the guides. You have to clean the insides very carefully and that can be difficult since there isn't much space. The second time I used them they scratched my new and very nice paring knife quite badly."
5,GREAT READ!,"Well written. Not only is it interesting to follow a man's personal growth from a woman's point of view, but the author's technique is such that each chapter stands well on its own."
1,The most disappointing book I've read in a long time.,"This book came highly recommended. I heard not one discouraging word, so what a letdown to read a boring story about a boring ordinary guy with a boring job. I read a lot, so I knew better than to judge a book from the first few chapters. I kept waiting for the yeast that would add life to this bland dough, but in vain. Then I realized what was happening. Revered, Canadian, Pulitzer Prize winning author writes another book and nobody wants to offend. The newspaper and magazine reviews speak volumes with their verbal gymnastics; variations of the old food reviewers ""succulent"".Then follows a synopsis of the story; an effort to fill space. The writing style was engaging enough to keep me reading, waiting for the payoff, but it doesn't climax so much as drift off to sleep. Disappointing."
3,Larry the lethargic,"For most of this novel I wanted to pick Larry up and shake him! Is Larry supposed to represent Modern Man? Confused, bewildered, and emotionally impotent? Surely not. He seems to sit center stage while people and events bend and shift him to one position or another.Has he any depth of conviction, or intellect, or feeling? (Other than with mazes - a clever analogy, I suppose). Considering the level of irritation with the character, I must acknowledge the skill of the writing."
3,Okay,"Not as good as the Stone Diaries, but a pleasant enough story. I was intrigued by the information about mazes, but found the continual presenting of previously covered material (as if it were needed as background info) jarring."
5,Another good one from shields,"Surprised to find it was about a man, but the author pulls it off with characteristic authenticity. Real truths about human behavior and relationships, combined with wry, sad humor."
2,Party's over,"I had 2 main problems with this book1) I didn't feel that the main character was a man. If he was a man he was castrated. Men have desires. Desires for all kinds of things. Larry comes off as a completely passive blob.2) The book seems like it was a collection of short stories strung together. Why did she have to recap everything for us in each chapter. It doesn't really matter why, it was simply annoying."
4,Romance novel,"A romance novel set in the South just before the United States Civil War, but much of the story is set in Cuba. The characters are in love with several different people, included married ones, before they get things sorted out."
1,B-O-R-I-N-G,"I think I have read every medical mystery ever written. This book contained a storyline that could have been good - notice I said ""could"". With the sentence structure thoughout the book, I have to wonder how it ever got past the publishing editor. Instead of focusing on the murders and subsequent investigations, the book rambled on and on with meaningless subject matter, then threw everything together quickly at the end. Good try, but no Robin Cook or Michael Palmer. Hopefully the next one will be a LOT better."
1,"This is a terrible, terrible book","I can't believe this book got published. It is horrible and ridiculous. This is seriously the WORST book I have ever read, and I've read a lot of books. It doesn't even make sense. The people who are giving this book good reviews are either a)illiterate b)brain dead or c)members of the author's family."
4,POETRY AND SONGS,"JACQUES PRÉVERT was a famous scriptwriter in the thirties and forties and also a poet.This cd is YVES MONTAND'S 1962 tribute to the man who helped him gained stardom in FRANCE.LES FEUILLES MORTES that YVES had first recorded in the forties has become world famous ,ever since FRANK SINATRA and NAT KING COLE had the good fortune of included it in their repertoire in the fifties.The other two highlights here are EN SORTANT DE L'ÉCOLE and BARBARA,very well put to music.The rest is unfortunately not as interesting;it raises the eternal debate of transfering poems into songs.When it works, like the three exemples cited,it can be marvelous;when it fails ,it becomes annoying.Still, that record was worth doing, and has a place in the heart of YVES MONTAND fans."
5,Love Jann Arden,"I fell in love with Jann Arden when I heard her single ""Insensative"" for the first time. I bought ""Living Under June"" just for that song, and became addicted by her music. When I saw ""Happy?"" I had to have it, even though I hadn't heard a single song.Her rendition of ""To Sir With Love"" is moving, soulful. ""Weeds"" is probably my favorite on the album, because it's like she's been inside my head at some point and ripped the words out without me realizing it.The thing I like about Jann Arden in general is that her music feels like me...like the music I would write and sing and play if I had the talent to do so...Its incredible!"
1,Women motorcylists,"I am a woman, a motorcyle rider, and an avid reader, so I eagerly anticipated the delivery of this book. I was incredibly disappointed. I can honestly say that I have never read (or tried to read, at least) a book so poorly written and edited in my life. Each and every page, and in some passages each and every sentence, contains spelling and grammatical errors. Incomplete and poorly worded sentences are the rule, rather than the exception. Unfortunately, the content was not any better. As much as I love motorcycles and reading, I could not get through this book."
4,Time Travel at its Very Best,I had never heard of John Clare but was pleasantly surprised.Very refreshing poems that take one back to a simpler time.That in itself is reason enough to read this book.
4,A wonderful book on appreciating the simple things in life,"This is a special, uncomplicated, old-fashioned book about teaching a child the basics of prayer. It starts with the simple things: keeping us safe, thanking God for friends, family, and yes, even my special painted chair. The illustrations are reminiscent of an earlier, kinder era. We love this book!"
3,Love Creation but done too dry and boring for kids,"Title explains it. The content is so valuable, but the way it was produced put the kids to sleep. Recommend a redo"
5,Kojiki DVD,It was great to find this DVD after seeing the concert some years back. If you enjoyed the concert you'll love this DVD.The picture quality is pretty good (looks like it may have been a laser disc?)and is acceptable for DVD.(Mike Oldfield's Tubular Bells concert seems to be the best quality I have seen to date) The sound quality would have been better if had been in PCM.But still a great disc.
1,Utterly useless...most annoying soundtrack in the history of instructional DVD's!,"This was a HUGE waste of $25. We were looking for something that would prepare us for bringing a Doberman into our home, but this DVD was not the answer! It gives some very very basic tips on grooming, etc., but if you know anything at all about raising a dog, it is USELESS!! Not to mention, throughout the entirety of the presentation a terribly annoying soundtrack is being played at an ANNOYINGLY high volume. Actually, the only redeeming quality of this DVD (the reason for it getting atleast ONE STAR) is the short bonus feature on Basic Obedience. If you are looking for something that will educate you and prepare you for life with a Doberman (from a puppy to an adult dog), DO NOT BUY THIS DVD!"
1,Not What I Thought It Would Be,"I would obtain this book through a local library or an inter-library loan system before making the purchase. The text addresses specific areas related to the media's reinterpretation of POW events, whether through the printed or film medium. Even though the book is full of endnotes I still found many statements or conclusions needing documentation--which he doesn't provide. Furthermore, some of the material related to the involvement of Sybil Stockdale is in error or taken out of context. Regarding VADM Stockdale: after in ""Love and War"" he wrote additonal books, which are not used as sources to address the development of his thought post 1973. And, leaving out the influence of Epictetus in his POW experience neglects a significant part of his story."
4,Monty Python dvd,The shipment arrived in time and in good shape. No dents or plastic wrap being ripped. I will order more from this website.
5,It's Monty Python..!,"Could anyone ever say anything bad about Monty Python? If they can, they haven't been watching , this set contains vital classics like ""Dead Parrot Sketch"", ""Lumberjack"", ""Upperclass Twit of the Year"", ""Hells Grannies"", ""Kilamanjaro Expedition""and loads more!You need this set..and every set for that matter..for your collection!"
1,Wenger Men's TerraGraph Automatic Swiss Watch#72764,"Please DO NOT BUY WENGER Watches from this particular seller ""leisurePro"". I paid 269.95$ for an authentic Swiss Wenger Automatic Watch. I thought I got a good deal. It was too good to be true. But all I got is a counterfeited Wenger watch and the ""Swiss Cross Logo"" on the dial fell off right upon arrival. I cannot believe that Amazon.com let these people sell counterfeited items. My trust in Amazon.com has shaken. This is the first time it happened to me receiving fake product and I have been Amazon.com customer for years."
4,Classic Chevalier,I love Tracy's novels - a mixture of history and fiction. She really transports me back to the time of the novel which makes me not want to put her novels down until I am done with them. I felt Girl with a Pearl Earring was better but this one is definitely worth the read.
1,Utter failure,"After enjoying Girl with the Pearl Earring this was an anticipated read, but the more I read the worse this book became. It was totally implausable; Ella was a bore. I found all the dreams and linking present day to 16th century by dreams & ""gut feelings"" on Ella's part as completely unbelievable. HATED IT!!!"
2,So much potential...,"After a one-day reading, I finished the story of Isabelle and Ella. Perhaps my expectations were a little too high after reading Girl with a Pearl Earring (I loved that one!)but I found this one disappointing. Stylistically, I found the Ella parts more well-written. Isabelle's passages were very severe, with these hyphens and the shifting. I never completely grasped her story because I was so put off by the style. On the other hand, I did not particularly like Ella as a person, and Isabelle's personality and her love were ""warmer"" to read about.As a side note, I loved the library/research parts of the book...I am a librarian and am always happy to see this in the books I read!I am glad that I read this book though, even if it was not all I hoped for. I really liked the prevelance of colors and the theme of religious history."
2,Interesting premise but a shallow story,"The idea of a story that incorporated the experience of the Huguenots with a modern day woman descended from Huguenots was interesting, but ended up being very disappointing because the author's characters were almost universally unlikable and the plot line was frequently shallow and unbelievable."
2,could have been netter,"I read this book and was extremly disapointed. The authour writes in french most of the time with the dialodue and such, and i dont speak french and from what i can remember from my high school french i could barely make sense of the story line. Not to mention the ending, what happened to Ella and rick/jean -paul. it is not very clear or what happened to isabella? Its like you only read half a book the ending is so bad. You wonder what happens next........................................................................!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,I was blue,"OK....I loved Girl with a Pearl Earing. I enjoyed the history, story and the herione. In this book I also loved the historical aspect of the book, but hated the whinning herione, Ella. Ella whines about: France, French people, her husband and on and on. She has a great life and then sleeps with a french man she hardly knows? Come on!! I want to whine that this book is not that good and the reader has no passion for Ella. I really didn't care what she did or didn't do. Isabelle is another story. Loved the story set in old France/Switzerland. Loved her heartache and her story. Tracy should have forgotton about Ella and spent her time on Isabelle, Marie and Jacob. Now that is a good story!"
2,Meh,"I loved Girl with a Pearl Earring and The Lady and the Unicorn; The Virgin Blue not so much. While the book was interesting enough to keep me going to the end, I can't say I actually liked it. I found almost all of the main characters unappealing, and couldn't see any reason for Ella's dissatisfaction with her marriage other than her inexplicable infatuation with Jean-Paul.Not exactly a waste of my time, but this book won't be a permanent addition to my library."
5,I am shocked that the primary review has been poor...,"...because I found this book to be much more satisfying, and far more intriguing, than 'The Girl with the Pearl Earing'. This is a gem of a book, and one I will never forget."
2,Blue missing pages?,"I was completely engrossed in the intertwined stories in this novel, staying up late nights to finish it, and was completely floored when it ended abruptly with no resolution on either woman's part. While some readers may enjoy deciding their own endings, I am not one and feel the author should have provided a sense of relief for readers desparate to find out what happens. I also was completely unconvinced by Ella's dissatisfaction with Rick. Many of us feel our spouses don't completely understand or listen to us 100% of the time (and vice versa), but this doesn't mean we instantly fall out of love with them and sleep with the first guy we find. Readers who like resolution: Beware!"
3,A FEEBLE FABLE,"The author seems uncertain whether she's writing a novel or a fable, and its her failure to resolve that issue which detracts from what could have been an enthralling book. She uses two storylines, one mediaeval, one modern, as the vehicle for the narrative. This can work well when both are proceeding to a climacteric and thence a denouement that will suddenly reveal the relationship between them. Unfortunately in this instance the device detracted from the flow, and the revelation could be seen clearly from quite some distance. Matters are not helped by the introduction of unlikely common factors, e.g. hair changing colour, shared dreams, and wolves. Nor were any of the characters sufficiently well-drawn as to engage this reader's sympathy, which was a disappointment."
3,Virgin Blue,"I found this tale lacking. A basic quick read ""romance to read on the beach"" novel. Predictable and far fetched."
3,I prefer the RC pets martingale,"I love Lupine products and I have the matching leash, so I thought I would give this a go when my RC pet martingale wore out. I have to say I prefer the RC product because of the chain versus the cloth on the slip (martingale part). The Lupine collar slip will get ""stuck"" in the tight position and not release very well. It also is fraying where the cloth meets the metal. I expected this to happen, but thought it would take longer than it did. Will get an RC collar again soon, even though it doesn't match my leash!"
4,Good watch,Especially for the price. Scratches easily but it could be my line of work. Stays accurate and does it's job. I am pleased.
5,jump start math,fun for kids 5 to 13++ because different levels can be achieved; fun way to improve math skills and be challenged.
4,cycling necessity,this camelback is the perfect size for a petite woman. it hugs your back without being confining and the long hose allows for easy access while you're riding your bike or walking.
1,Nothing happens...,"What if you assembled a band and started to record them, but nothing happened. They played and played, but nothing musical happened. It just went on and on and on. And still, nothing happened. There is no musical development, no divergence from a deadly boring formula here. I don't get it. If this represents Yo La Tengo's musical abilities and creativity, I don't understand their stature in the music world. I haven't been so bored listening to something since hearing my parent's Perry Como records. Very frustrating and completely without merit."
3,Genius Band. Pretty Record.,"I'm a huge YLT fan. Ever since the early nineties gem 'PAINFUL' found it's way to my ears - the band has grown and matured beautifully. ""And Then Nothing.."" was a wonderfully majestic piece of brilliance. This one stays on the same drifty course but tends to drift a bit too much in certain places. Love the band, like the record. Would have liked to hear more of the risk taking YLT have been known for. Georgia's voice is great here though."
3,"Movie Good, Dub Bad.","The anime isn't that bad. The fights are fun, lots of special attacks used. There isn't as much nudity as I would like for a +17 story, and what there is, is pretty much censored.My main problem with this tape, is that the dubbing, stinks. Even with the volume of my TV as hi as it would go, I could barely understand what they were saying over the sounds of the special effects.My suggestion, get either the subbed version, or the DVD. That way, you'll at least be able to understand what they're saying."
5,Haynes manuals,"I am a do it yourselfer and I have had Haynes manuals for each and every vehicle that I and my son's own. They make an automotive maintenance project doable for the ""shade tree mechanic"", and their step by step instructions with pictures make the jobs much easier. I wouldn't own a vehicle without one!"
3,A little long,"Started out very good and kept you interested, but I think somewhere along the way it lost something. It took me to long to watch. Costumes and sets were great, but got boring towards the end."
2,Junk,This album is one of many lately that BH has created that sounds like he didn't know what he was doing when he made it. Its chaotic to the point of nonesensical. There is nothing cool or catchy or interesting about it. I'm a huge fan of BH but lately he's becoming extremely disappointing. Sad.
3,"Great show, not enough.","***SPOILER ALERT*** I am completely addicted to this show first of all. I own every season released in America so far. This one I must say I'm the most disapponted in. Every one of the seasons so far had a story with some sort of resolution at the end. This one starts off with the adventurers making their first advance into the Hueco Mundo and eventually Las Noches. Then, 11 episodes in, (the number of episodes included) it just stops. It leaves the adventurers mid-fight, not even reaching Orihime yet. This is a change from the second season, where the entire set is focused on everyone making their advance through the soul society, then at the end they finally reach Rukia. I would have really liked for this one to at least end with the adventurers reaching Orihime. My recommendation is to wait until the next season comes out in September and buy them together so you don't get that cheated feeling of just completely stopping in the middle. I wish I had waited."
5,Hip Spiritual,"This CD brings spiritual music to the modern music listener. This is music in many genres, but all with a spiritual message. The songs range in style from rock to jazz to African to '40s swing. There is something for everyone. This is music you can sing and dance to and at the same time pray with. Whatever your religion, there will songs on here that you will identify with. I recommend it highly."
4,The New NOFX?,"The current political situation has brought a new sense of urgency to NOFX's music. The EP is great and NOFX is musically tight. There's some good old school sounding stuff and some ""new"" sounding stuff for NOFX. Can NOFX save the (political) day or are they already preaching to the converted?"
5,Good EP,"This EP definitely shows NOFX's evolving sound. For some reason this [upsets] some people ..., but i think the only people who get [upset]at it are the shrewd who cannot deal with change because NOFX has a great newer sound. Along with the sound the lyrics are something everyone can relate to whether you disagree with them or not. Overall: great EP and can't wait for the album"
3,"Great score for analysis or reading along, not so much for playing","I'm a music major in college, and I bought this book to use for analysis. There's plenty of room between staves to write notes or mark the chords and whatnot, unless you have freakishly large handwriting. But I definitely have to agree with Davey's review. This book would be HORRIBLE for playing along with. The pages will not stay and lie flat on a music stand unless you use paper clips or something, which is obviously not so doable when there's several page turns per piece. I was able to make it a LITTLE better by folding the cover back, but still not useable for playing.Still, this is worth buying if you want an affordable score to read along with a recording or analyze the pieces. The engraving in this book is crisp and easy to read, not to mention it comes with a VERY useful glossary of the French words used in the scores."
5,Real help with financial trouble,"The nitty-gritty of handling creditors, all the details and the how-to, to help one understand what to do, and how to do it."
4,This CD has many of Selens'a great songs,This cd has a song for every one .You also don't need to know that much Spanish.
5,A Powerhouse of a Movie,"This movie is an incredible moving expierience. Nick Stahl plays Chuck Nordstatt in this coming of age drama. The charming kid is beleved to be ""too unstable and removed"" to complete his dream: to be a pilot in the army. Once more, he doesn't have any recollection of his father, and his mother refuses to divulge such secrets. His older sister, and many of his friends think he is seriously disturbed. So he begins to question his self worth, and begins to think he is crazy. Then he meets with resident town freak,( Mel Gibson in his most powerful performance ever) an ex-teacher who decides to tutor him to help him acquire his dream. The movie teaches a valuable lesson, but doesn't come off as preachy(which is to it's benifit) Both charachters find what they are searching for in each other. The resoloution is visually stunning and touching. It proves that someone you've known for only a short time can impact you for the duration of your life."
3,Great Quotes,"This book certainly has some great quotes to make you think and contemplate differnt aspects of life, however the original content is minimal. There are many other books on the market with more in depth and original information. Wouldnt hurt to have this book, but not a necessity."
5,1-2-3 GROW!!!!!,"I had the first Jorge Cervantes DVD, but I gave it to a friend as a gift, so when this came out, I figured I'd get discs 1 and 2, plus some other marginally useful stuff for the extra $10 ""Box Set"" price. When it arrived, I must say I was surprised and impressed!The packaging is very nice, when you open it up, there's lots of awesome bud photos. There's a big booklet with Jorge articles and grow info, too.The bonus disc is really long, with lots of extra garden tours, and special features. ""Jorge's Guide to Amsterdam"" was cool, like the type of show you'd see on a pot-friendly travel channel. And of course, the discs #1 and #2 are full of the thorough information you'd expect from Cervantes. I was very happy with the value from the box set, and overall I'd recommend it!"
3,Swingingly Swinging!,"This book was my ""going to sleep in bed"" read every night. I enjoyed the story and learning of the History of Treasure Island, but I was not impressed with the writing style. I listened to the CD about 4 times and still didn't get it. I wish I had not paid full price for this."
1,i order a dvd but recieve a cd,"this is the first time i encounter something like this here in amazon and its very upsetting of all the items that i order my dad is really looking forward to this al martino dvd concert and when it finally came in its just a cd ....even in the receipt's product details it said ""In Concert: Classic Featuring Al Martino [DVD] (2004) Al Martino"""
2,doesn't work?,"well i got the product plugged it in and it didn't work. i sent an email to the company and they never responded, not only that but their return policy is so bad that you'd spend almost as much as the refund you'd get. just not worth getting in my opinion. it was a waste of money."
2,ipod to alpine ainet cable,Doesn't charge my ipod touch. It also cuts out with my both my ipods. All in all its not very reliable.
1,Simply Awful,"I would refrain from buying anything from Jabra again in the future unless it was absolutely necessary. I received a defectve model; it does not charge no matter what steps are taken. The plastic is simply cheap and flimsy for $50 as well. The company's tech support is also sorely lacking; 8-5 Monday through Friday does not help someone who receives their headset through the mail after work Friday. Do NOT let this be your first headset, because such a shoddy product and such poor customer service was enough to turn me away from this type of product now."
3,You must do the adjustment,"I have three of these lighters and they have all worked poorly. Low to non-existent flame, no matter how adjusted. BUT I discovered the Amazon review that talks about adjusting the flame. This is slightly more than turning the black knob on the base. You must pull off the knob, and loosen a screw slightly, and then turn the adjuster one little click counter-clockwise, tighten the screw up and then put the black knob back on. Now try it. I was ready to send them all back to ZIPPO in one big box with 1 $5.00 check and hpe for the best, but it is now not necessary.All are working and all are working better than they ever have.IF YOURS IS WORKING POORLY TRY THE ADJUSTMENT."
1,A brand name with a super BAD product,"I bought the Classic MPL, after I used it for a few times, the flame became so small that it can hardly light up a candle. Even if you adjust to the max, it is still the same.I returned it and get a replacement. Well, it has the same problem.The only time that the flame is good enough to lid a candle is when you just filled up the butane gas. After a few click, the same problem happen agaqinThew design is beautiful. Sleek and modern look. Well, maybe it will worth lots of money when it become antique.Skip this problem. It has problem."
1,Bruce Lee: EXPLOIATATION of A Dragon Story,"Having watched this film from start to finish I am convinced that CD Now should give us the option of voting 0-1/2. Considering this ""MOCKUMENTARY"" isn't worth a whole paragraph...the whole movie can be summed up as follows: (1)The 1st fraction of the movie touches on Lee's college life, marriage, opening of a kung-fu school,and early film career, and (2) The rest of the movie is GARBAGE...Lee's pretty much portrayed as an infidel and emotionless adulterer who forsook his wife and kids to be with Betty Ting Pei and appeared to love her more than his own family. And the closing credits have Bety Ting Pei appearing to be the victim/widow as she walks alone on the beach. TRASH...a cruel joke. What's worst is the fact that Lee Roy Lung(Bruce Li) was supposed to have idolized Bruce Lee and wanted to carry on his legacy, yet he was a part of the TRASH! No love for this one."
3,It was kind of too long,"It wad all right... Takes about one daughter's perspective of searching for her mom, loving her and dealing with her schizophrenic illness. It also touches upon her childhood up bringing and how her grandparents treated her mom as she became dependent and mentally ill.It gives a positive understanding of loving your mother with schizophrenia and how she can comprehend her love for her daughter.."
1,Problems with software,I ordered the software and it came without a serial number and the software does not work. I have exchanged at least 4 e-mails with them and have still not been able to get it to work. I can only assume that the software that Amazon sold was a fraud. Very disappointing.
1,WTF!?,"Okay... this movie is a waste of film. Boring to say the least. Terrible acting, no scares at all, no real monster shots, and honestly nothing worth EVER replaying this movie for....I stress the EVER part. I've seen a huge amount of really bad horror movies but this one doesn't even get good b-movie laugh credit. Throw it out, burn it...please do anything but watch this horrific piece of garbage. If it were possible to give a lower rating I would!"
1,Girl Power,"""The Craft"" is a silly movie about four teenage girls who are into goth, darkness and witchcraft. They`re mysterious, edgy and hip, know what they want and how to get there, so beware. As the story unfolds, the more childish and ridiculous it gets, presenting teen rebellion in an obvious and over-the-top way. It even has a dated soundtrack with some mid-90`s alternative rock bands, and it`s not very good either. The characters aren`t menacing or interesting, so why should we care? Probably some 13 year old girls will like this, though. Otherwise, it`s just a powerless craft."
5,Lesson to be learnt,No should start some thing that he/ she cant finish. Things might get out of control. The world of Magic is real and very powerful. This movie depicts that at time innocent magiccan also back fire. Real Magic is for the strong and the integrated.A movie worth watching!Sudip
4,Good Movie little to no truth,As far as hollywood is concerned this is one of my favorite movies. But as far as witchcraft is concerned the pure lack of truth is amazing. I've seen saturday morning cartoons deal with witchcraft more realisticaly. But over all I enjoy the movie alot. I even went out and bought it. I think the actress did a wonderful job as well as the settings and directing. Just one note of advice next time you make a movie that has to do with witchcraft how about consulting with someone that practices witchcraft. Thanks
3,Silly and fun--90210 with spells,"This is *not* a movie to be taken seriously, but it *was* fun. Four ""freaks"" band together to perform spells, and when they're successful, they get back at the jerks at school. If you merged ""Heathers"" with the early episodes of ""90210"" and added a dollop of the ""Witches of Eastwick"" this is what you'd get.Young kids might take some of this more seriously than it should be taken, and teen girls mired in angst will likely watch it over and over."
3,Purely Entertaining...Wiccans Chill Out!,"I really, really, really like this movie, and I own it. Ibeleive in witchcraft and practice it. That does not take a witch todo that.This movie was made to make $$ and to be entertaining. Please just enjoy the special effect and talented actresses in the movie. Please just enjoy the movie END"
2,Okay hi..,"So any of you that think Witchcraft/Wicca is bogus, yeah you're just like the people that think Christianity is bogus. It's a religion, and this movie does not portray it right. And the thing with the crosses, yeah, the day I did a report on Wicca in a class i wore my cross. It's just something to wear, it has nothing to do with anything. Whatever. This movie is okay, aside from the fact that it spawned a billion little teeny boppers deciding that they thought they were witches. It does have a decent message though how not to mess with the powers. I'd rather watch Charmed."
1,Awful Customer Service,I ordered this product at the beginning of March and have emailed them twice b/c I have not received it yet - no response. It is now the beginning of April (past the time provided for shipping) and I still do not have the dvd. Awful customer service.
1,Didn't get it at all,"Didn't get it at all. Had such high hopes because of all the good reviews. The premise sounded intersting enough. The movit was just strange. It was dark. I mean literally dark, a lot of shadow and dark and had to make out what was going on all the time. Nodded off about 30 min into it.. and didn't feel like I missed a thing. Thank goodness I rented, if I had bought it based on reviews I'd be kicking myself in the arse right about now."
3,A Waste of Terrific Actors,"As a longtime fan of the cult film ""Blade Runner,"" I had hoped this film would be in the same vein--and maybe it will, in time. But the convoluted plot is too much even for this great cast--Ralph Fiennes, Juliette Lewis, Angela Bassett, Tom Sizemore--hey, this should have been a great film. But the actors struggle bravely to not much avail. The one clip I enjoyed was Fiennes' and Bassett's sexy kiss at the end, but it was pretty unbelievable that two people who had just been almost beaten to death could have mustered up much erotic drive. Fiennes fans will enjoy seeing his usual brilliance, but don't expect another ""Blade Runner."""
4,The Time is Close at Hand!,"I happened upon this movie two years ago on HBO, loved it, and have watched it on a regular basis ever since. I dig the futuristic qualities about it, as 2000 is a mere 17 days away. I thought Ralph Fiennes, and Angela Bassett were great as the leads, although my patience with Juliette Lewis wore thin very early on. If you're into dark, futuristic, action packed movies, this one is for you!"
5,"Fantastic, a cult classic, Juliette Lewis is fabulous.","This movie is by far one of my all time favorites. The cast is almost too good, even the minor roles, you get so wraped up in the movie that your angry when it ends. The only thing i dont like is the lack of character Juliette Lewis got to play. The scenes she was in, especially her breath taking renditions of P.J. harveys songs, were extraordinary but in the original script she had more scenes which I think would have given her character and the movie more kick.Shes one of the most real and raw actress's out there today and should be given more credit.The rest of the movie and cast were just great. this is on of the most overlooked and underrated movies I have ever come across. I sometimes think if they had realeased it nearer to the millenium, that it would have done better. But i guess we will never know."
4,Slick Cyberpunk Noir for people who've seen it all (already),"If it wasn't plagued by confusing and promiseless trailers, Strange Days could have elevated its breed of techno-underworld fiction to the popularity of, say, epic space adventures. Sadly, many didn't take the opportunity to see this complex and well-produced thriller in the theater.What makes Strange Days stand out amidst other early 90's cyberpunk movies (like Johnny Mneumonic) is its emphasis on the film noir roots its genre was founded on. Its characters are well-rendered, and the plot (though centered on technologies not yet available) is believable, if a little disturbing."
3,No longer really worth owning unless for collecting purposes,"This single release has been on three different formats (3"" CD and 12"" and 7"" vinyl) with varying tracks between them. Those tracks are, of course, Kidney Bingos, Pieta, Drill Live, Over Theirs Live, and a short track called Pieta La Piccola; the latter being the only track that hasn't been re-released on remastered editions of 'A Bell Is A Cup' to which Kidney Bingos belongs. That being said, unless you can find any of the editions that contains that one track this CD really isn't all worth it, except of course if you're building a strong collection.Personally, I've never cared for the title track, too soft and out of Wire's realm for me (though I'm sure that was their intention). The live tracks are okay, but you can hear better ones on later releases (not that a few more wouldn't hurt). The track Pieta is a great outtake, in my opinion would've made the album much better."
4,Thought-provoking and entertaining.,"While his theories are inescapably controversial, Immanuel Velikovsky's genius has to be recognized. In this book, he pulls together Talmudic, Babylonian, and Egyptian texts, amongst others, to show that Ramses II of Egypt was actually a contemporary of Nebuchanezzar, King of Babylonia. In the process, he seeks to demonstrate that the entire known history of the Hittite Empire is a mistake, that there was no such civilization, and that our modern take on history is false. Sound like hogwash? Maybe, but it is presented very well, and addresses all of the issues as they arise. You may not agree with the theory, but poking holes in it will be tough. A challenging read, and by the end you have the feeling of having been through a good mystery book...you will spend hours thinking about the time frame in efforts to disprove the book. Highly reccommended."
5,Husband For A Year,"Back cover reads:*The husband deal was over...Stefanie had been the ideal temporary wife to powerful Gabe Wainwright. Only , now that their one-year contract was up, he found himself strangely reluctant to stop being her husband...*Would their real marriage begin?Stefanie knew Gabe was a man of his word, and he'd stuck to the in-name-only deal to the letter. But how she wished he hadn't! Still, maybe it wasn't too late to negotiate a new wedding contract--this time, forever!"
5,Beautiful Paper!,"Love the paper, having hard time deciding what to do with it now that I have it since it's so much more beautiful than it shows in the picture."
3,A little flimsy,"Though much of the fan is metal, it is a little flimsy. Tilting knob can be a little better...it keeps tilting down. It gives gentle breeze for my daughter's top bunk area for hot summer days and she likes it. Better than any other clip-on fans I've seen at the stores."
3,GOOD LITTLE FAN FOR A SMALL SPACE ONLY,"THE AIR KING 9145 CLIP ON FAN IS VERY GOOD FOR A SMALL SPACE. THE BAD PART I FIND,THE INSTRUCTION SHEET AND PART LIST,IF YOU NEED A REPLACEMENT ,THERE IS NO ADDRESS LISTED TO SEND FOR A REPLACEMENT PART. THIS IS VERY POOR. arthur A.Davis Cambridge,ma."
2,"Excellent Clip-on fan, Except that it falls down out of its clip","A sturdy little fan, with a grippy clamp. Very adjustable. Lacks data regarding how much power it draws. Grounded plug. Not too loud, especially on lower setting. Added 1 January 2010: But, having used it now for three months, I am a bit disappointed by the flimsy clip, as noted by other reviewers. Hard to say if it is a design or manufacturing defect, but defective it is. When you try to adjust the fan or to move it, down it goes. Much to the fan's credit, its multiple bounces on the floor have not destroyed it.So, my modified review is: a great fan if it is going to stay put. If you plan to move it around, find one with a better connection to its base."
5,allows snuggling at night,We got this fan to circulate air in our bedroom at night while we sleep. It allows you to snuggle without gasping for air since you are not continually inhaling your partner's exhaled air.
4,have multiple,have had these fans for awhile now. i recently had the first fan start to burn out. it has been running almost non stop for 2 years. it is still working but starting to make noise and slowing to about half speed. i am very satisfied with this product and price but wanted to give a expected life time on this fan.
5,perfect little fan,"I got this fan for my son to use in his bed. He gets very hot at night. He clipped it to a shelf next to his bed and uses it every night. Has a nice steady sound. No ticking, tapping or wobbling noises. The size is nice too. Not too big and not too small. We are very happy with this purchase."
2,Not a Universal Fit,"1) It arrived more orange than the picture shows.2) The product description said that it fits most Kettler highchairs. The pad was much too big for our Kettler Futura highchair. It hung off of the seat where our child's feet could not use the foot rest.3) There were no straps to attach it to the chair.4) Feels like a patio chair cushion (the cheaper kind). Not that soft, but I suppose that's good for wiping off messes?"
2,"Slow, ok for documents","Not a great product, very tempermental. Negatives are blury and colors are not accurate. This is one of the slowest to warmup, and slowest to scan. Forget anything above 2400 dpi. This is big, bulky, and clunky at best. I wanted to upgrade my canon N1220U. I needed this to scan negatives..."
2,yuck - cumbersome,"the scanner was purchased mainly to digitize boxes worth of 35mm photos. The picture quality is lousy - the dust removal option in the HP software helps a little, but I have to spend a ton of time in Photoshop cleaning up each image. Secondly, it's horrible at differentiating between a photo and blank space. When I put multiple photos on the scanner bed, it rarely gets it right. Again, I have to spend a lot of time manually selecting the photos. When I was shopping for scanners - I skipped over the $100 range and went to the $200 range because my family photos are important to me. I know you can go way up from there too - but digitizing photos is a colossal job already ! - I resent that I've lost so much of my time due to the scanner's poor performance."
2,HP Scanjet G5040,It's difficult to get the scanner to work. We have had it for over a month but its been almost useless. Too time consuming to take the trouble. I have other products by HP that work without the frustrations. What should I do?GG
2,"Slow, sketchy slide performance","I tried to install on my XP box, install went very wrong even though I followed the instruction explicitly. Tried to uninstall and it would not go away. Even when I booted into safe mode it would not uninstall. I was ready send this back. I finally did a clean install of Vista Ultimate and the install went as it should have. It scans slides OKAY only, nothing to hoot about, but I do recommend you scan to TIFF not JPEG, as the results are much better. The dust removal is worthless, get a good brush and a Q Tip. I'm scanning slides that are over 50 years old that my father took, and the good part is it does 16 at a time. It does remember the settings if you tell it too, and if you scan at over 600 DPI it is really slow and heaven forbid you try and use the 6 color option, start the scan and come back tomorrow."
1,G4050 Poor Vista Compatibility,"I bought this scanner for a local Historical Society so they could scan 16 slides at a time. I downloaded the ""Full Feature"" software for Vista and the scanner would not recognize the TMA adapter (the slide/negative scanner) no matter what I did. It did not even show up as a option in the Scanning features. I called the wonderful HP Tech Support number and got the infamous poor-English speaking Indian, that could only follow a checklist. After finally telling him to forget the checklist I asked him flat out if this was fully compatible with Vista, he said NO, but it will work sometimes on some systems. That was the end of my adventure with this scanner and got an RMA from Amazon to send it back. I'm off to buy Canon 8600 scanner WHICH is fully compatible with Vista. Do not buy this scanner!"
4,HP Scanjet G4050 Photo Scanner,"I purchased this scanner for its ability to scan up to 16 35mm slides at one time. Once you get used to the scanner software and how to open the top cover without removing it from the scanner, it does a great job. I have scanned @ 900 slides. After each set of 16 slides, the software asks if you wish to continue. After you answer no, the software closes and then you get a Windows error shutdown message that I can't explain. Even though it shouldn't happen, I now treat this as part of the process. The quality of the slides is great & I will re-scan slides I have done a few years ago because the quality is much better with the HP."
1,I do not recommend this book,"Most pieces are very average transcriptions of the real pieces of music and, as in the case of Round Midnight, they sometime are in a different key. Not an inreresting book to have, even for a beginner or intermediate pianist."
3,"Great pieces, but transcriptions are questionable","I've played many of the pieces in this book before, but when I bought it I found the transcriptions were actually variations of the real pieces. Some pieces have bits of improvisation added to them(which really defeats the purpose) while others were in entirely different keys. By changing keys (for example they changed ""Take Five"" from Eb to Bb) it really just complicates the fingering in certain pieces. I'm no vituoso at music, but I don't think this is worth the money. :-("
2,Didn't fit,It will vary by individual but it didn't fit my ear. It was also in a small plastic bag so who knows where it came from. What do you expect for the price which I can't complain about.
1,Bad headset,"Item did not work for me. It had no packaging at all, just thrown into a small ziploc bag. it didn't even come with the extra earbuds that I know comes with this product when new."
3,Reddawnape,"I have mixed thoughts about this headset, which mainly is with the ear piece design. It did not work for me. The quality of sound was good and I was told the sound of my voice was clear, so from this stand point no problems. This may be a head set for someone else, just not for me. Delivery from this company was very good and as promised."
4,WORKS GREAT,The headsets that I ordered were in good shape but the order did not include the replacement ear pieces. I prefer the longer earpiece and this product only came with the short stubby one. The headset was not in its original packaging.
3,"Functionality, iffy, sound great","I'm not sure if it's the fact that there were no instructions included in my packaging, or that the product works unreliably. By trial and error, I have managed to make this product useful most of the time. The on/off switch located on the boom mic must require a certain ""touch"" to trigger the voice prompts, because I have not been able to make it work all the time. That means, I can't reliably start a call or end one. But, when it works, it is great! You have to have set up a voice recognition phonebook, I think (but I can't be sure because I HAVE NO INSTRUCTION BOOKLET). The sound quality when you connect with your party is excellent, from both ends of the conversation."
1,Did not work,"The ear piece in this product produced no sound. Also, it didn't fit right and I don't even see how someone could use it. It doesn't seem to fit around my ear and very awkward to even try. Too cheap to return, so just throw it away and write it off as a loss."
3,Not bad for the price.,"Item is comfortable in the ear, I hear everyone fine no matter what phone, but depending on the phone the other person don't hear me well. My cordless AT&T phone it cuts my voice to the listener. With my Cricket A300 I sound like Micky Mouse to others."
2,"When it works it works, when it dies it dies!","I have owned three of these. When they worked, they were great. Then, about a year from purchase, they just die. I liked this Jabra so well I bought it again, and again. But no more.My rating is based on my frustration of the third one dying.Surely a headset should last more than a year!Now I'm trying the Plattronics 510. I hope it lives up to its Amazon reviews."
2,Jabra C250 EarWave Boom,"I ordered two of this item. One works fine, the other does not work at all! I am taking a chance and ordering one more due to the minimal cost."
1,Didn't work. Sent it back.,"The earpiece didn't work right out of the box. Tried it on a couple of different iPhones which worked with our current wired and Bluetooth earpieces, but couldn't hear a thing from the Jabra. Returned it the same day."
5,One of the Funniest Movies Ever,This purchase was made to replace my VHS tape of the movie Tootsie. I have enjoyed seeing this movie over and over. Dustin Hoffman is just hysterical in his portrayal of a female soap star from his audition to the end. A must see movie.
4,"Lange, Hoffman Fun To Watch","It's strange how seeing a man dressed up as a woman always seems to be funny and popular with the audiences. Milton Berle helped make television a hit with skits like this on his early 1950s show. It works here, too, with Dustin Hoffman applying the makeup and playing the role to the hilt.Helping Hoffman is Jessica Lange in, by far, her most attractive role. I'm not particularly a fan of hers but she looked spectacular in here, almost like Marilyn Monroe.This was a popular film because the humor was good and the two leads did a nice job, and people like a good romance story, too. Hoffman, a fabulous actor, has always been able to play diverse roles. He's an amazing actor.Sometimes overlooked is the big-name supporting cast which includes Dabney Coleman, Teri Garr, Bill Murray, Chares Durning and Geena Davis. The latter was making her screen debut in here!"
4,Javitch Read,"Dustin Hoffman in a comedy set in New York City. Hoffman plays an unemployed actor, Michael Dorsey. After his girlfriend failed to get an acting audition for a soap opera, he dresses in drags under the alias ""Dorthy Michaels"" (Great Alias...) and gets the job. Now most people thing that a movie like this would be realy stupid. But like the old saying goes; ""Never judge a book by its cover"" (Some Guy Page Unknown). Tootsie offers minutes after minutes of classic comedy, that are only matched by the greats on Comedy Central. 116 Minutes"
5,One of the best BBC series ever written,"This is a wonderful series based on the books by James Harriet. Well acted and written. Television the way it was meant to be. Beautifully filmed in Britain the series takes place just prior to and into WWII. The life of a country vet with rich characters. Compelling stories of tragedy, Humor, compassion, and love of the animal kingdom as well as the harsh reality of controlling disease and the difficulty of raising livestock in pre war Britain. I grew up with this BBC series broadcast on public television, the only place you can get great programming. Truly a wonderful family show to watch together. No violence, obscenity, or innuendo to be had, I always feel better after watching an episode or two."
4,Whole Body Stretch,"I was looking for a good book that I could get ideas for stretching. I am getting ready to be a fitness instructor and wanted to learn new stretches for before and after the class. The book is really good, but most of the stretches are done on the floor. I wanted more stretches that I could do while standing up. But overall I am very happy with my book."
5,Not just for athletes,"This book was recommended to me by a skating organization. I thought it would be for top athletes..and while it is...there is a section for typists, people on their feet all day, methods of stretching to avoid surgery in some instances, etc.I have recommended the book to my elderly parents. I can happily recommend the book to anyone. The instructions are clear and the format is ingenious."
1,Results May Vary...,"While I am very careful to avoid discomfort and injury when learning a physical activity from a book, this book was so difficult for me to follow that I ended up experiencing pain after my first session. Not only that, but this session was only meant to familiarize myself with the stretches and assess my flexibility!! Luckily I could sense the problems well enough to stop after about 8 of the stretches. The only way I will attempt this method in the future is with instruction and close supervision by a qualified person. As others have pointed out, maybe there are better AIS books to learn from, but after this experience, I am extremely skeptical to try with ANY book."
1,Skip this book and buy the original by Aaron Mattes,"Skip this book and choose ""Specific Stretching for Everyone"" or ""Active Isolated Stretching--The Mattes Method"" by Aaron Mattes, the guy who first developed these techniques. His site at http://www.stretchingusa.com has more info on these stretches.The exercises and the narrative descriptions in the Wharton book are copied almost verbatim from Mattes' original book--nothing new or helpful is added other than some self-promoting anecdotes about athletic successes--and Mattes' original book has clear and helpful photographs, unlike the amateurish and confusing line drawings in the Wharton book. Mattes' book also includes detailed stretching routines for upper/lower body, neck/shoulders."
1,Giving credit where credit is due,"Although I think the Wharton's are knowledgable and write a user friendly book, they did not invent Active Isolated Stretching. They studied with the man who did invent it, Aaron Mattes. I like their books and even their video, but there is no excuse for not giving credit where credit is due. Be honest guys and do the right thing."
5,Black is back,This is black as black comedy gets. If you like your entertainment dark and twisted then Ravenous is for you. A very inventive film with a great score to boot.
4,Quirky horror film is well made and better than expected,"In my opinion Ravenous was a great film, including great perfomances by Pierce and Jones, a fresh soundtrack, and solid story. The film may have not done well in theatres because most studios now are pushing horror to a younger crowd, and the local and time period of the film probably didnt sit well with teens (the largest demographic for horror films). The DVD itself has great features, my favorites including director's commentaries and deleted scenes. FOX should be scolded for headlining David Arquett in the poster when he was in the film for about 6 minutes. His performace, like all of his overrated acting, was not worthy of such a honor. Jeffery Jones had much more screentime (and is a much better actor). FOX justed wanted to capitilize on Arquett's popularity from the Scream films. To sum up, rent or buy this film, it was a lot of fun."
4,good,there was a fast arrival time and the movie played perfectly. very happy customer. i enjoyed the experience of shopping.
4,TWISTED!!,"This movie was real interesting and different than anything i've ever seen in my life! The acting was great and I loved the score, the eerie music set the mood at all times, specially in the wilderness. I thought Carlyle did a great job along w/the other actors. The only thing that kept me from giving it a 5 was that it took too long to engage the viewer into the action but otherwise it's a good movie. Go rent it!"
3,Finger licking good,"A lonely cannibal who doesn't want to dine alone. Kind of a catch 22, isn't it. Oh well, if you tire of the company you can always eat them! I liked that this movie scared me in the fact that there really are such people in the world that do such things."
4,buy it,"what are you waiting for? don't listen to a bunch of stuffed shirt critics , this movie has it all, indian myths about flesh eating Wendigos , cool cannibals, breath-taking mountain scenes and trippy music."
3,Printer is only black and white,"I bought this machine thinking that the printer was also color, read really carefuly before you buy. I cannot return it now, but wanted a color pmultifunction machine and ended up with a black and white only printer and a color scanner instead."
2,Had me on the edge of my seat...,"To leave the theatre.Wow. I expected more from this film. It looked like a class B thriller. Which means plenty of thrills and even some cheese thrown in for fun. It's premise is unoriginal but brilliant in these days of typical teenage slasher flicks. But somehow it just didn't work. It wasn't scary, and there was no pay off in the end. The truck driver was just some big fat dude, nothing special or scary. I just couldn't get into it, and it just didn't work on a few levels. It had some nice scenes, like the big bad truck going THROUGH this other truck in the beginning. The cornfield chase was nice looking. The end was nothing special. And I dunno when he had time to do what he did at the end. Not to ruin anything for ya. If you wanna see a better thriller road movie, rent Kurt Russell's Breakdown. It's simpler but much more mysterious and thrilling."
1,Movie is too predictable and not really a thriller,"This movie is too predictable, and I wouldn't recommend this to anyone who wants to be thrilled or scared. It doesn't really thrill or scare you, unless you're under 10 years old. With the high 4.5 rating on amazon, I thought this movie would be good, but it was a bit disappointing. BUY ANOTHER MOVIE, TRY TO STAY AWAY FROM THIS ONE."
4,Jawsome,"First off none of the other reviewers who gave this one star really know what they are talking about... This borrows many elements from spielbergh's Duel. Also Dahl was paying omage to that film using the same looking car that was in Duel. Also this film was made two years ago but couldn't get released due to columbine or something in that vein. Also Jeepers Creepers is a slasher movie this is a very pulse pounding thriller. It kept me on the edge o my seat the whole time. The ending is also very good, yet a little predicatble. This is a great movie to see with a group of friends if you want to have a great time being scared. I would give this 4 and a half."
4,Reride,"A movie that revisits the scares of the original ""Duel"" with Dennis Weaver. Here they add a CB radio for the thing that sets off a trucker in a killing spree. Not so much constant driving as suspense at a motel and other locations. Where as Weaver was alone and mainly constantly driving, this movie has three people making several stops and being subject to much more suspense. Well worth seeing. I recommend for a rental, but I like it better than ""Duel"", but after all it has been about thirty years since that was made."
5,"Joy Ride (starring Paul Walker, Steve Zahn, Leelee Sobieski)","Wow. This movie creeped me out worse than Final Destination did. The acting is actually pretty good, altough Matthew Kimbrough kind of hams it up a little too much. As for the car chase scenes, there are a lot of people who are saying it looks like a rip-off of Jeepers Creepers. Well, ordinarily I might agree... except that I will almost guarantee you that filming of this movie was finished by the team Jeepers Creepers was released."
4,John Dahl strikes again.,"The sort of bore with sreaming teens and an unstoppable killer clutters up video stores. Tis shows what talent can do with that old wheeze. If you liked Kill Me Again, Red Rock West and Last Seduction give this a try. Constant suspense, and as an extra some killer truck scenes. The bad guy is not as interesting as say Michael Madsen and the cast no Nick Cage or Val Kilmer or Dennis Hopper but they work fine. Give it a try but don't start watching at night if you have to get up early the next day. A winner."
3,based on a trailer...,"based on a trailer i saw on E!, this movie seems to be exactly what the title says it is...the main character buys a car which contains a cb radio in it. after playing a practical joke on a big rig driver, the main characters are continuously running from the driver who is trying to kill them...sounds like it should be quite a thriller...."
4,Very Helpful,This book really helps to understand some of the things cancer patients go through and how to respond without hurting them more. I felt the real life examples were extremely good.
5,I LOVED IT!,"I've read all of Anne Perry's books in the last 18 months and am anxiously waiting for the next one to come out. I have become quite attached to Hester and Monk and nearly jumped out of bed with total glee at 1 in the morning when I finished. I had to remind myself that these are not real people. Unlike some other authors, Anne Perry seems to be keeping her story lines strong. I hope she continues for a long time. I can't wait to see what Hester, Monk and Rathbone will be up to next time. I'm also looking forward to hearing from Thomas and Charlotte soon......."
5,THE ALMIGHTY C!,"More musical and bluesy than past albums, it's still unmistakably Clutch. Their bio goes on about the genres covered from punk to acid rock and everything in between.I prefer to call it like it really is, rock served straight up in a dirty class."
4,solid rocker,"Solid rock cd from this band. They can do no wrong. Not a classic in their discography, but I dig it."
3,Decent...But not impressive,"Eventhough, i truly miss those Zombie babies. This game is still good, hey its Silent Hill (its the only thing we have left to Resident Evil..since PS2 isnt going to carry it no longer). Silent Hill 3 has an odd and mundane story that comes on really wet..and leaves..well, dry and vague. Its too dark, so, playing and seeing the items are a bit hard, controls sloppy...what else is new and it really doesnt get me into the game like pt. 2 did. Im sorry, this game is just a ""rent a game"" for me, part one is better...story wise and part 2 is better..graphics wise and both are better than Silent Hill 3. If you get it, rent it first..you'll see what i mean. Decent game...not that great."
2,What just happened?,"Great game! Scary game!Bla bla bla bla..... very boring. I am a huge fan of horror games. But, this was very dissapointing.(A waste of 50 bucks) .Many people saying that it would give you nightmares! Hell no! The reason, I gave it two stars was because of the story and graphics. The gameplay is horrible. Combat is very weak, so you just run away. Also, there's like a million freaken doors, that have broken handles, and that's very annonying.It forces you to explore. The monsters just look wierd, not at all scary! I reccommended Clock Tower 3 or Residnet Evil X Code Veronica better!"
2,Easy-listening/commercial synt. music,"It is not so bad, but too commercial and easy listening to be rated 4/5 stars. Moreover only four tracks are real tracks, the others are just 'links' between the tracks. The last bit is orrible. If you like synthetiser music, buy Vangelis or Tangerine Dream. If you really need to buy something by Mr Jarre, try Oxygene or Equinoxe. Good luck."
5,For The Child Who Loves Dinosaurs,"Interesting and educational, this was a hit with my five year old dinosaur lover. This is well written and beautifully illustrated, however, not necessarily for children who are younger than five. My three year old (soon to be four) did not understand the process of how this creature came to be a fossil. Still, this is one to have in your library for generations to come."
5,From the Romantic Times--Compelling,"""...the mystery is so engrossing that you won't want to put this book down. Wonderfully suspenseful, Erickson's novel also features a nice understated romance. Secondary characters also add to the enjoyment of this well-written romantic suspense."" Susan Mobley, reviewer"
2,"Good Live Stuff, but low rating since it is so short.","This was a very short CD Single with the American Idiot version of Holiday on it, then Holiday played live in NY, and then Blvd. of Broken Dreams also live. I love the live version of Holiday, but Blvd. of Broken Dreams doesn't have anything that interesting going on in it not to make you want to listen to the American Idiot version instead.The CD is way too short to pay full price for since you're only getting one decent song that's worth listening to that is not on another CD. If you get a real good deal on the CD, get it. If not, just stick with American Idiot."
4,Stoned in L.A.!,"Woods, once again, does not disappoint for plot lines in this audiobook and you don't need to have listened to other Stone Barrington novels to enjoy this one. Peopled with the glitterati of Hollywood this fast paced mystery ear candy was thoroughly enjoyable on the 3 hour car ride with twists and turns that mirrored a Baja endurance run. You never really feel connected to these people in any meaningful way but you enjoy the tabloid sleeziness of it all. My one complaint is the reader (and hence the 4 stars instead of 5). Tony Roberts does not do it for me at all."
2,What Have You Done With Stuart Woods?,"Normally one of my favorite authors and my favorite series, I found this book to be pretty bad. The dialog was shallow (do we need to hear his telephone calls word for word, including details of him identifying himself and leaving word on how to reach him?), the characters even shallower (are there *any* women in this book besides Mary Ann who don't walk around buck naked and throw themselves at Stone?). Even the main characters were pretty unlikeable this time around -- doesn't Stone have anything else to do but boink everyone in sight? Doesn't Dino have a job to do in NY? Why is a mob boss so easy on Stone for dumping his princess daughter? Why isn't Arrington at least grieving for a husband she certainly didn't dislike? Why would Mary Ann invite her sister to dinner knowing the circumstances?..."
2,Disappointing,"I really was disappointed. Is Mr. Woods going through male menapause? I know he can do much better than this, glad I got it from the library and didn't spend good money on it."
1,This sucks.,"Cool monsters, great concept and just a horrible, piece of garbage game. The controls, game play, and difficulty due to the crappy controls and bad game play make this game unplayable."
5,JAZZ CAN NOT BE BETTER THAN THIS,"Boxes are fine,but they are expensive,so why not settle for this good overview of muted MILES and COLTRANE discovering his talent as a great soloist.Reducing those two to 65 minutes of music certainly wasn't easy because everything they recorded together is interesting.I first discovered them twenty years ago by buying ROUND ABOUT MIDNIGHT which i still think is their best;the title track included in this collection can resume jazz by itself:feeling and emotion.Get this cd and you'll find out what jazz is all about, and also that today's technology can not by itself gave you greatness"
5,Jazz Doll,These performers have always been the best in the business. This is old school jazz at its best.
4,A very good quality tool.,"This is a tool that I've been needing for a long time. It has proven to be a useful quality tool that has served me well for the year that I've owned it. My only complaint (and the reason for the 4-star rating) is that there is no precise measuring ability outside the digital display. On another note, if you need to get into tight places, this may not be the caliper to get. Otherwise, it serves its purpose (and me) well."
2,doesnt measure properly.,"does not work well due to the long length, and no way for the measuring reader to tell where it is on the rod. if you want to use this to measure a brake drum, the reading is immediately wrong after expanding the claws. you could see this by zeroing the caliper, then fully expanding it and closing it. the closed reading goes from 0.00 to off by 22mm. a calibration stick is needed for large measurements, otherwise all measurements are far from accurate"
4,"Crazy, entertaining but not great...!","The 4 stars goes totally all to Michael Douglas for the great performance given on such a peculiar script. I can't say I didn't enjoy the movie, because I did, but I found part of it a bit strange.Personnally, I found Evan Rachel Wood was not giving her 100% and many times, her expressions didn't fit the situation. To me, that plays a lot in a movie.Apart from this, it's entertaining and in most parts funny, especially with all the ridiculous ideas in Michael Douglas character's mind."

3,Maybe not King but ok.,"Michael Douglas is one of my favorite actors and he does a great job with his latest film ""King of California"". The story overall is so so and fairly simple. A 16 year old girl has had to fend for herself since her mom has moved on and her father has been locked away in a psychiatric ward is now reaquainted with her father. Is his idea of finding gold in the suburbs of Santa Clarita residual craziness or can he really be onto someting? The two have good chemistry but aren't helped much by such a simple plot. This film pales in comparison to most of Douglas's other films but is still enjoyable."
4,very watchable,"the storyline is simple, but it builds up very nicely and you don't feel bored at any point. Evan rachel pretty much carried the whole movie -- excellent performance. it's been awhile since i've seen michael douglas did a convincing act. Not oscar material but it's an enjoyable watch."
3,Cute but 1/2 a size too small,"I probably would need to get these is a 1/2 a size larger than my normal 7.5. With socks on, they are not comfortable. They look very nice but the exchange isn't worth it to me. It might work for you but order your size plus 1/2 size up."
1,If you like child abuse and child rape this is the movie for you,"I was appalled that this movie got high marks from critics and reviewers. Unless you like child abuse, both physical and mental and child rape, I don't know how you could actually like this movie. There are lots of movies that give a glimpse of life in China that are MUCH better than this. I really regret buying this trash, and feel gyped, as the DVD cover misleads."
1,Waste of time.,The movie was way too long and I don't understand how this could have been nominated for an academy award. Very overated!
5,FAREWELL MY CONCUBINE,"very creative in all fields, acting is excellent, color and sound very good historically educationally correct I hope this is what you want. Joe"
5,One of the key gay movies,"Great movie, reflecting what happened and happens more often than people think. A true milestone..."
5,Beautiful movie,This film is so beautiful and brilliant. It has Chinese opera juxtaposed with all of the changing historical events. Like any good film it uses many motifs and symbols to tell its story effectively. Also the acting is outstanding.
5,Great Product,"I had the Motorola bluetooth before and had a ton of problems, my friend suggested this model and its wonderful. It's so much better to use with multiple bottons and easier to operate. Its just hard to hear with it's windy. In any case i would recommend this to any one who can't stand the other blue tooth"
3,Had to return 2 in a row - both were duds,"I bought one and it has worked just fine. Some issues with it re-pairing with the phone if I leave it on and walk away for a long time and then walk back. In those cases, I have to power cycle it to get it to re-sync with the phone.Bought one for my wife. First one was DOA - wouldn't charge. Second one worked for about 3 weeks then wouldn't charge anymore. Bad batch?** Update 11/21 **My other Jabra BT500 has now also stopped charging. That's 3 that have had the same problem. Jabra support was quick and easy. They are shipping me a replacement and covering return shipping."
4,Jabra BT500,"Very comfortable & doesn't move around while turning your head in traffic (on bike or car). However, definitely has a bass-y quality to it. Sounds a bit muffled. However, don't get complaints from people on the receiving end of the conversation. The Plantronics has better sound quality, but I found it to move around too much (even while walking around outside)."
1,Stopped accepting a charge,"I used it for less than a week and charged it 3 times. On the fourth try the green light disappeared and it wouldn't turn on.I bought this because i loved the Jabra 250 and I still use it, as a matter of fact.I was just really disappointed that something like this (for the price I paid for it) would just stop working for no good reason.I should've bought the plantronics.Don't waste your money on this."
1,bad blue tooth,"very bad shape(very big),sound quality is horrible,and it just lasts for 2 months and diedi will never buy jabra any more"
1,"Don't Buy, unit is faulty","It stopped charging after 15 days I used it. Clearly the units have a production fault, as there are many comments about the same problem."
4,A little scrathy,"I love the set up and the comfort of the Blue tooth device but, I am getting a little noise in the background."
1,Piece of JUNK!,I have tried many different bluetooth devices and this one is the worst. I had to hold my phone (Ipnone) so close to it I may as well have put my phone to my ear. When my phone was clipped to my belt the BT500 you cut in and out when I was either listening or speaking. While wear the BT500 it was like walking around with your finger in your ear. There are other bluethooth devices that rest on your ear instead of in your ear. I would not reccommend this product.
3,Good Headset,"This headset works very well. It is very large and not that easy to get on your ear. So, if you're after comfort, this isn't it. But, if you want great clarity and sound and function - this is a good one for you."
2,Jabra BT500,"It's BIG. It works, or worked. Won't charge at all now but when it did work, people could understand me ""OK"" - not as good as just talking directly into the phone, but when you have to drive or have your hands free.... Don't think I'd buy it again."
4,Jabra BT 500 Headset Review,"Very comfortable and relatively unobtrusive, easy to conect to my Blackberry, volume could be a little louder. Overall a very good headset"
2,USB charger non standard,I chose this device because it offered a USB style charger and I am trying to consolidate all of my device chargers to USB. Sadly the charger uses a non-standard connector. It does not use a USB mini-B connector like most current USB devices.The headset works fine.
3,ear peice,I was enjoying it very much until it stopped working. Would not take a charge any more. Other than that I was loving it. I think I will try it one more time before I totaly condem it.
1,Pricey and stopped working after 4 months,I would give it minus infinity rating if I could.I paid $120 for the headset and adapter and it's dead after only 4 months.My husband is always on the road and a wireless headset is essential to him. He also told me that other truck drivers always asked him how he made this headset to work. After 4 months he knows why they asked him this question. I buy now on cellphoneshop.net.
4,happy in ca,"this is more comfortable than i expected an over the ear pice to be, and the sound is great, in my old loud car. i had a Minolta one that really sucked and am so happy with the jabra in comparison. its totally worth the money and in california its the law now."
3,BIG,"I gotta say, this thing is alot bigger than I expected. I have a pretty big head, but this thing hangs a couple of inches below tha back of my ears. It works great and pairs easily, sounds good as well. Fits well under motorcycle helmet. But would look much less awkward if the mic that comes down from the unit was flexible so that you could contour it to your personal ear size. Maybe that's a good idea to submit to Jabra..."
4,Works and comfortable.,"I had a motorola Bluetooth headset. I felt like Lt. Uhura with a giant ear piece in StarTrek. I had a hard time keepig it in and after 20 mintues it hurt my ear. It came with my accessory kit in one box with the car charger and case so I just used it and grumbled. But when my toddler flushed it I got the Jabra as a replacement.I love it! It works and stays in my ear, feels comfortable even after 3-4hours in my ear. I use it only when I drive and I have used the voice dial and it works perfectly. I set the voice commands using the headset and it works. When I set them without using the headset it did not work well.Great little device."
4,Great Carrier!,"When I bought this carrier I was looking at the baby bjourn's, but I couldn't see paying that much for a carrier that didn't seem to fit my baby right! I love this carrier it is comfortable and feels really stable on! My daughter likes to be faced out, the only thing I have to say is when she is faced out I have to put arms over the the part that folds down (unlike the picture) or it will continue to flip up over her face! All in all a comfortable and reliable carrier! Good for the $$$!"
3,A bit cumbersome...and restricts movement,This is the first carrier that we purchased for our daughter. She enjoyed it when she was really small but was not a huge fan when she got bigger and wanted to face outward. The front support panel clips in over the child's shoulders and therefore requires that the child's back remain snug against your chest at all times. Riley was most distressed with this restrictive position. She wanted to be able to lean forward and look around. We ended up buying the Bjorn carrier and she loves it! The front support panel clips in underneath her arms and she is free to move her shoulders around. I would have gotten the Bjorn in the first place if I'd realized this.
4,Winter a la Brasil,"This is an excellent set, an early (1964) foray by an American into the world of Brazilian jazz, with all Brazilian musicians backing Winter. There are many great Brazilian songwriters, but Carlos Lyra has to be among the very best. His compositions truly sing, and Winter, Mendes, Neto, Banana and Lyra himself show here just how much. The lyricism is unparalleled--sensuous, lilting melodies...One caveat--SONY Special Products put out a two-album compilation on one CD which includes this and Winter's Rio, and on the first album (Sound of Ipanema) set, the second track (""Se e Tarde Me Perdoa"") is exactly the same as the ninth track (""Mas Tambem Quem Mandou"")--specifically, both of them are the second song. SONY is not owning up to this; if you don't mind not having one track, the SONY version is worth getting."
5,A strong foundation,"I love the variety of layouts and the book is clear and easy to use. It is a creative and useful tool.I especially like the ""four corner foundation layout""."
3,Run small,"These shoes run small in my opinion, I wear a 5M and the shoes is so tight it is uncomfortable on my foot."
5,Required Reading to undestand the physics of sailing,"When I decided to learn how to sail the right way, I asked a circumnavigator what one book he would recommend. It was this one. The book is NOT light reading. But it is extremely informative."
3,Celine changes style,"Celine Dion has a great voice, and I've loved all her previous CDs...ALL of them. But this CD lacks the Celine Dion style that I love. It's more poppy, and it seems like she's trying to fit typical teenage pop style like Nine Days and Nsync and that sort of music. It annoys me a little. Some songs are her natural style, but a lot of them just lack a piece of her. So if you like extreme pop, you'll like it, but if you like her previous style, I don't know if you will."
4,One of Celine's Finest Efforts To Date,"If absence does make the heart grow fonder, then Celine Dion sure knows how to accomplish the job. In this, her latest release, she doesn't over-do her vocals, opting instead for a gentler, more relaxed approach that suits the listener just fine. From her hit song ""A New Day has Come"" to the cover of Etta James' classic ""At Last"" and everything in between, this is a winning combination of songs and vocals. A New Day Has Come, indeed - Celine proves her mettle on this destined-to-be-a-classic collection."
5,There's a reason she's a diva,"It's because she's good. Celine Dion has become one of the most famous diva popsters of all time, and this album showcases some of her most satisfying and memorable songs, from the soaring ""I Surrender"" to the rivetingly catchy ""I""m Alive"" and ""Right in Front of You"". Her hauntingly beautiful rendition of ""Goodbye's (The Saddest Word)"" is an enduring classic, and virtually every song on this disc can be played over and over without losing its flavor. She does descend into showy histrionics a few times(""At Last"" and ""The Wrong One Loves You Right"") but overall an intensely satisfying and glorious collection. Her ""A New Day has Come"" and ""I'm Alive"" are two of my favorite songs of all time, with their rhythmic affirmation of life and hope. A good introduction for new fans and a must for any old one."
3,Hmm,I'm sorry- is it me or can this woman just not sing well? She sounds like she's just screaming badly to me. The songs are so boring and sound like she could be talking about her poodle as easily as her husband or baby. So what's the point?
5,A Nice Comeback,"After being absent from the musical world for two years, I give this lady credit. She still has a wonderfully soothing voice and her songs are magnificent. I love the songs 'I'm Alive' and 'I Surrender'. The tunes and words match well and her voice is so smooth they couldn't be sung by anyone else. I also enjoyed the re-mix of 'At Last'; she is definitely worthy to sing that again. The two different remixes of 'A New Day Has Come' are also worth a shot; though the radio mix is at a faster pace, the other is still beautiful. All in all, I give this CD a thumbs-up: if you are a Celine fan go out and buy it right away. Good job Celine with a nice comeback of an album."
5,Best In A While!,"It's been some time since I last heard Celine being this emotionally energetic about the songs she's sung for an album, where pop culture and racing around hasn't exhausted her to no end... It might not be the biggest flare and 'in' album for most, but for the fans, she's done a great job of getting herself back out into the world as she endeavors in being a mother and wife while also striving to greet the world in a neat balance with the changing times. A New Day has truly come! Oh and, if anyone bothered to read the pamphlet or has a great ear, you'll know she does a little singing with Shania Twain and Mutt Lange on ""Goodbye's (The Saddest Word)"", just one of those songs in particular that gets to you if you actually 'hear' it out!"
5,Best album ever???,"WARNING!!! Do NOT buy this CD if you DON'T love GREAT music!!! Dare I say this is Celine Dion's best album ever??? Yes! Yes I will go that far! A New Day Has Come is Celine's BEST work since Falling Into You! In my opinion, it's even better than Falling Into You! I've never heard Celine sound so fresh as she does on this album! It's like a new artist. A new Celine. A new day has come. The song ""Goodbye's (The Saddest Word)"" had tears running down my face! And there are SO many GREAT songs on this album! I first heard some of these songs at the taping of her CBS Special. She was so magical that night and she's magical on this album too!"
1,oh my god what a mess,"She's has an powerful voice and she's very pretty but.... just because she's has an good voice dosen't mean that her songs are any good. The only song I really like is ""One Heart"", the rest is just sad and boring ballads. Come one Celine make me happy and do some happy and good pop songs. Maybe she don't want to make millions of dollars. I don't understand why people keep wasteing their money on her crappy albums. Avoid this and any of her albums and singles and buy anything from Madonna instead."
4,Inspiration from Within.,"Celine Dion is one of those artists who have the ability to create a hit ballade song after song. Her music is soul-stirring and no matter how down you are feeling when you start listening to her music, you will be inspired, encouraged and uplifted to be joyous.This CD continue her Celine-Quality -- and won't let you down. It is a wonderful investment and has some new songs with new style.. This CD will keep you going :) Just buy it."
5,Forget the critics-they have nothing better to do,"My ""lady"" is back and good as ever. Celine's message on thisCD is timely for her as well as all of us. Her voice is justas good, the songs have important things to say and done withher usual class. The music is excellent and raises my spiritsjust like the past. A woman to emulate she just gets better."
4,Makes one experience joy and despair simultaneously.,"Sue Townsend takes on a morbid subject with style. Christopher is a sad character, but has a new beginning with Angela. To read of a reunited couple after so many years was a joy, even if they were brought together under morbid circumstances. Sue made me hate Crackle and feel deeply sorry for Tamara. I just wanted to take Storme in my arms and protect her from her parents. I am so glad I found this book in Amsterdam. I am not sure where the relationship to the Adrian Mole series comes from...could not be more different characters. Regardless, another delightful read from Sue Townsend!"
1,Insult To Average Intelligence,"Kudo's to Boating's Editor in Chief JOHN OWENS - he has crafteda Public Relations tape and is charging a lot efor it - the best part was when cabin supplies were covered, ""pillows, blankets, drinking water and plenty of food"" - actually, I'm torn - maybe the biggest tip was what to do on your boat, ""watch TV and dont' forget to listen to music..."" Of course, these significant tips were only given in between advertisments for Boating magazine and other products JOHN OWEN can profit from. It is clear to me, based on this poor production with no subustance, that JOHN OWEN and Boating magazine are not intelligent people, and expect even less from their audience. Let us hope they NEVER cover safety tips on boating - it could be a disaster to every boat on the water."
2,shipping issues,"The CD is a good one but arrived in poor condition. The envelope was torn 3/4 open and the plastic casing was completely smashed. Two songs skip but I needed it for my anniversary song (which fortunately plays fine) so I didn't have time to go about seeking retribution. Very, very dissapointing."
1,Phillips should be sued!,I can not believe that Phillips had no idea what it was doing when it unleased this $1000 beast on an unsuspecting public.Do these errors sound familiar: ABF09B56 or DB****? Of course there's no documentation on them and customer service pretends it doesn't know what you're talking about.How do we get Phillips to recall this product and give us replacements of another model (or manufacturer) that works?
1,Not a long term performer,"I've had this DVD player for less than a year and paid $500 for it here at Amazon. It just recently started to give errors when playing commercial DVD's (even brand new ones!). I swore off Sony after theirs stopped working after one year, now I'm swearing off Phillips. What next, Panasonic?"
4,Use Proper Connection,"I'm *very* pleased with this recorder, but I'd like to give one note of warning.If you want to copy a tape from a VCR, I want to emphasize the importance of using a VCR with either a Component Video or S-Video out connector. Using the typical Composite Video connection can result in a pixalated image."
1,Don't Even THINK About It!,"When I first got this machine some months ago, I thought it was wonderful, and I told my friends what a great deal it was. Now my machine is dead and so is theirs. They did not die all at once, they just developed more and more quirks and finally became totally useless. In the interim we all threw away lots of expensive disks, which only adds to our loss. The money, the time, the frustraition....I've a friend in the electronics repair business, and he's done some investigation on this machine -- it seems like the problem is in the optical block, which only lasts a few months of heavy use. A replacement only lasts a few months also, so the entire design must be flawed. ..."
1,THE WORST EVER,"I HAVE THIS RECORDER, AND LET ME TELL YOU, I BOUTH IT WHEN IT WAS EXPENSIVE, AND THE THING HAS NEVER WORK ONCE, I SEND IT TO THEM BUT THEY DIDN'T WANT IT BACK SO I HAVE IT THERE AS JUNK , THINK TWICE BEFORE YOU GET IT, THEY ARE OTHER ONE BETTER IN THE MARKET NOW, THAT OFFER BETTER SUPPORT."
1,A Major Disappointment,"I have to echo many of the bad reviews here. I bought this recorder in June 2003. After about 5 months, I noticed it had trouble playing regular DVDs (could not locate PBS clock, disc error, etc.), then it starting shutting off when recording DVD+Rs. Now it seems its only use is a doorstop. What a shame, and shame on you, Philips, for promoting such a defective product. I will never buy another Philips product again."
1,Bad Machine,Bought it new...used it once.....two years later it will not recognize DVD+R. Terrible surprise. My Panasonic machines are still going!
2,Not sure yet,"I've had my DVDR985 for a little over a year now and I too have started getting disk error messages following the finalizing of the disk. I had been throwing them away at that point but have recently found that if I remove the disk and shut the unit off, upon startup it recognizes the disk and things seem well. So I'm not sure if I'm on the slippery slope toward total failure or what. From what I've been reading I'm thinking I'm doomed. I bought a three year service contract and am close to handing it over for ""repairs"" whatever that might be. It sounds like no one knows for sure. I have found that it is sensitive to the particular brand of disk you use. The Verbatium disks give me major problems but Fuji disks seem very stable, they are all +R's not RW's."
1,I only give this item 1 star since zero is not available.,"This is new technology and it shows. My ""recorder"" is only good for playing DVD's since the machine has never been able successfully record anything. What is worse is Philips customer service, who refuses to fix the problem. Save your money, this is nothing more than an overpriced DVD player."
2,"Great unit, right up until it implodes...","I purchased this unit in May 2003. It actually was a replacement for a unit bought in April 2003 that had static on the right sound channel, but the second unit had no problems. I used the unit nearly every day, recording TV shows and backing up VHS tapes, and it worked like a trooper. Then, after about 10 months of use, it began to have strange error messages and wouldn't read discs it had just recorded. I did a quick online search and found out this problem is very, very common. I'm probably going to have it fixed, as it's still under warranty, but I'm going to buy another DVR from a different manufacturer in the meantime since there's no guarantee that the unit will be fixed within the next six months. Am I glad I bought it? Very much. I've saved many priceless memories with it. Would I buy another one? No."
5,Great product. Better than great.,"I've made about 75 DVD+RW and DVD+R recordings so far with this deck. Not a single bad result. I have successfully tried about 10 different off-the-shelf DVD playback decks and results have been fully compatible. I've also used a half dozen different brands of media (all of them fine).Both the deck and the user interface exude a well-designed and constructed quality.The user interface is perfect in the sense that it is uncomplicated for making quick recordings, but there is a lot behind the scenes if you dig into it.I agree with another review that a keyboard would be a big improvement (even a USB port to plug in your own). Beyond that, there's nothing else I'd want changed."
2,ruined my knives,"i bought this product, after reading all the revews and since this has the plastic protection previously lacking i felt confident it wouldnt damage my expensive and cherished knives, so i started it on my whustof knife, and to my astonishment when i removed this knife guide from the knife it left a nasty scratch on my knife looks awfull needless to say i trew them away, the dmt sharpening guide is way better and worry free, i learned from my mistake,hope this help others."
3,Daughter Likes It,"She saw this season on tv, but wanted it at home. She watched it once (selected episodes)... now it's collecting dust. It arrived on time and in good condition - no fault of the product or Seller."
2,Possibly Their Worst Episode,"Before you waste your $ and time on this one, they don't find anything at all. There's really no good stories or examples of paranormal activity that witnesses provided, they just go on and on about how they chained prisoners up on the rocks to die at low tide.They hear some minor bumps and knocks, but that's about it.Not very entertaining, but you do get to watch Zach up the ante on dressing and acting like a Jersey Shore douche"
2,Ghost Adventures: season Three,"I think it's a big rip off that they have show's from Season Two on Season Three!! Check it out before you buy!! Pennhurst School, Ohio Reformatory and more!! And they over use the white laser lights for ORBS get real guys!!"
3,This anime is OK but it's nothing compared the the manga,"I have a few problems with this anime. Story changes aside my biggest problem was the way they changed the look of Gally. They turned her into a bubble eyed freak which was disappointing from the strength you see in her in the manga. If your a fan of the manga go ahead and get this anime. It can't hurt. But if you haven't seen the manga, I would suggest getting the first 2 or 3 volumes of it then viewing this, so you can get a feeling of what Gunnm(Battle Angel)is really like."
3,Bloody ultra-violent manga with a heart.,"Unfortunetly, when they adapted this wildly popular comic story by Yukito Kishiro into video, they took it upon themselves to change the heroine's name and much of the story line. I still found it entertaining; a cute female cyborg with amnesia, taken under the wing of a bounty hunter who's also her ""mechanic"". She undertakes the ugly profession on a quest for self discovery. The main character is thoughtful and endearing, but make no mistake- this video isn't for kiddies."
5,BAttle angel,This is the best Animation I have ever seen. Very good story line and great characters. A definite most own.
5,Definitely One of The Best!!!,Beautifully done. The amazing story of a young Hunter-Warrior's love for a wanted man. This anime full of guts and gore mixed in with a moving romance. Truly the most moving anime I have ever seen!
4,a much better choice than trailblazer,"I recently purchased the Trailblazer after reading all the positive feedback on it. What a disappointment! After spending three days trying to adjust the numerous straps and clips, I simply could not find a comfortable setting. It was just too cumbersome! The Cross Country is lighter, much easier to adjust, with a sleeker design that makes it better for travel and storage. We use a backpack often...just around the house and for travel...and this is a great choice. My daughter sits very comfortably in it,is able to see everything around her, and is able to interact with me without straining to peer over my shoulder like in the Trailblazer."
1,The magic of believing,"I purchased this book because I own an old hard copy which I found inspiring many years ago,. This paperback is too small and not enjoyable reading."
4,Oldie but goodie,"I wish that some of the examples had references or documentation. Zero footnoting. Old edition with very difficult to read print that was almost blurry in places. Some examples have more recent scientific explanations that are not related to the power of belief. Nevertheless, it was quite interesting and difficult to put down."
1,The narrator was so monotone I couldnt even listen...,"The book seemed so interesting, and I tried several times to listen to it, but it was so terribly narrated I just could not focus on the words. I found my mind wandering while the narrator droned on and on and on...he was putting me to sleep as I drove!"
4,I listen to this every day on my drive,This is an abridged version of the book and provides an excellent selection of the primary lessons. The actor's voice is great; it sounds like the voice of a middle aged man would have sounded in the 1950's when the book was written. If you liked the book I strongly suggest you purchase this recording.
5,Another Hit!,"I have a 20 month old who absolutley loves this book! She discoved the light switches some time ago and so she loves to see the effects in the book that back up her experiences! Of course, at her age we are using the book as a tool to increase her language by naming objects and colors. I also only ask her to find Blue hiding in the dark and not the missing toy as asked for in the narrative. This is what I love about these books - they capture her attention immediately with the characters and colors and they can ""grow"" with her. As she develops more sophisticated problem solving skills I can then start asking her to find the missing toy. If your child likes brightly colored pictures or the show itself, then put this on your book-buying list!"
2,Not for Babies,"My 11-month-old son loses patience with this book. He's not really old enough to figure out which toy Blue has put away from page to page, so he usually loses interest after about 4 pages, because the pictures are kind of repetitive. This might be better for an older toddler."
4,good nostalgic fun,This album does contain a couple of 70's pop classics such as Mungo Jerry's 'In the Summer Time' and Greenbaum's 'Spirit in the Sky' but steer clear if you are a musical snob.For the most part this album is comprised of those bouncy cheesy numbers that everyone of a certain age group will remember from disco's. They are the songs that you still know the lyrics to and that your foot taps to but you wouldn't openly admit to liking. Do you remember 'Chirpy Chirpy Cheep Cheep' or Sweet's 'Little Willy'? These are just two of a plethora af similar titles.Highbrow is something that this CD could never be called but for a trip down memory lane it is well worth a listen.
3,A good crime drama well worth watching if only to set up the superb sequel,"Despite a tight narrative, Johnnie To's Election feels at times like it was once a longer picture, with many characters and plot strands abandoned or ultimately unresolved. Some of these are dealt with in the truly excellent and far superior sequel, Election 2: Harmony is a Virtue/Triad Election, but it's still a dependably enthralling thriller about a contested Triad election that bypasses the usual shootouts and explosions (though not the violence) in favor of constantly shifting alliances that can turn in the time it takes to make a phone call. It's also a film where the most ruthless character isn't always the most threatening one, as the chilling ending makes only too clear: one can imagine a lifetime of psychological counselling being necessary for all the trauma that one inflicts on one unfortunate bystander."
1,One Great Song Does Not a Classic Make,"Other than Heavy Metal Drummer, this album is totally mediocre. This album is perhaps the most overated, overhyped alternative album of all time. I do not see what all the fuss was about. I guess that sums up Wilco for me in general. I could not name another song on this album because none of the other tracks are worth remembering. Download Heavy Metal Drummer off a paysite and skip this album at all costs."
4,Oddly Beautiful...just like I like it!,"""Yankee Hotel Foxtrot"" is my first experience with Wilco. After reading all the positive press, I just had to see what all the fuss was about...now I see.The word ""honesty"" is the first word that comes to mind when recalling this album. The guys just lay it down, period. Simple chord structures and innovative yet familiar melodies compliment eachother nicely here. The songs vary from light, barely-strummed dirges to happy little rocking numbers. The album is just a nice little change of pace from the norm...dig it.Vocally, Wilco brings to mind Wayne Coyne of the Flaming Lips...thin, just barely in tune, not trying too hard...very direct. Musically, I get Radiohead, Gomez, Flaming Lips, maybe even classic Beck. Sit back and relish the melody."
2,Somnambulatory Soundstage,"So, everyone's favorite somnambulist grunge muswell hills hero tells us now that he has been addicted to painkillers. I, for one, am not surprised! Summerteeth is the one worthwhile record this band has produced, with sounds from eno, lennon, brian wilson and others blended together in an off-kilter formalism of subverted swagger. But this record? Please! If your in love with the idea of loving Wilco than love this too! Otherwise, steer clear of the pretension and the passionless pedantry. Get Spoon fed or borrow Ian Hunter's lead (as in better dead than read)."
3,its ok.. it you like that kinda stuff,"it has one f the best covers and great photography in the cd panflet. that is y i boght it, the music is like country and love songs and that stuff, im not into it that much but i still listen to it... its pretty good buy."
2,"Tuneless, Boring, and Pretentious","I've enjoyed a lot of Wilco's music, especially A.M & Being There. So I bought into the hype and purchased this one.The only thing that saved this from a One-Star review was the song ""Jesus, Inc."" which I enjoy a lot, other than that I found this CD to be completely tuneless, boring, and pretentious."
3,They're not sure where to go.,"While this album is completely void of their country influences, it comes across as an album that was put together with little care. There are some songs on here that save it from getting two stars. ""Jesus etc,"" is probably my favorite, followed by ""War on War,"" and ""Heavy Metal Drummer."" But other than these songs, I find that the album doesn't hold together very well."
1,inacurate review,"Some guy said that he couldn't post a 1 star review, so I wanted to try this. I'm guessing that it won't show up much. I happened to really like the album, although, I'm no critic, so I can't add any eloquence to my thoughts.No real information, just the fact that out of all my CDs (100s from the past, less and less as time goes on) this one tends to get played more than the rest since I got it."
5,This is the album Wilco was born to make,"Wilco's been moving into a wonderful direction with each new album, taking the best elements of pop and giving them their own sound. This culminates perfectly in ""Yankee Hotel Foxtrot"", and they have truly outdone themselves.Every song is a winner, whether it be the straight up catchy pop sound of ""Kamera"" or ""Heavy Metal Drummer"" to the more subdued meandering melodic ""Jesus, etc"" to the somewhere inbetween but equally wonderful ""I Am Trying to Break Your Heart.""I simply and without hyperbole love this album with everything in me.I miss this album when I am away from home. My mind keeps returning to these songs, and I itch to be home and hearing them once more."
5,Big fan of this band and CD,"You do need to listen to this album a couple of times before really appreciating how good it is. This album is definately different from what you hear on the radio, because the songs are actually good and there is substance to the songs. It's definately hard to state what exactly is great about the album, because it is different for everyone. It's one of those CDs that you can listen to a year from now and still think it's great. I don't think everyone will like this album or this band, so I do suggest listening to the songs a couple of times before purchasing the CD. But if you do buy this CD, I think you'll find it to be one of the best CDs you've bought in a long time."
2,It's Legend is more impressive than the actual album,"I can't think of a single soul who wasn't on the edge of their seat waiting for YANKEE HOTEL FOXTROT. The news of a band defying their record label, releasing the album for free on the internet just for spite, then.... going to another subsidiary of the same label... anyway... at first listen, it was like smoking a Cuban cigar... forbidden in this country. Once the initial joy wore off of listening to this album that defied executives, the real critical ear went to work. The album is dry. The songs tend to run too long and there is a bit too much noise. They can be borderline irritating, and this comes from a listener who tends to like more experimental sounds and artists that have an acquired taste. This album is a must-have simply for the story, but for the music, it's best to stop with ""Summer Teeth""."
3,at times divine but . . .,"I have never been a huge fan of Wilco, they've always seemed to be on the peripheral to what I was listening to and highly recomended by people who think alt-coutry is a real style of music. I finally was seduced into buying this album by having the patience to listen to and get over the pop cliche of ""an expiremental phase"". . . and I found that all the noise (which I usually love) does a lot to balance the band's often boring delivery and unexceptional vocals. Semi-depressing songs and some noise does-not-an-art-album-make but some how I think Wilco pulls it off here and delivers a nice, if not expected album."
1,Yankee Hotel Foxtrot,"I have been a fan of Wilco for that last several years, and am disappointed in the direction of the new CD (Yankee Hotel Foxtrot). The music was predictable, monotonous and at best ""painful"" to listen to. I experienced new levels of tolerance, while attempting to listen to the CD."
1,Disappointed Fan,"The media line was that Wilco's old record company refused to release Yankee Hotel Foxtrot because they just didn't understand the art to it. After one listen, I realized they didn't release it because it is so bad. I loved Son Volt and Wilco's first CD. Tweedy has degraded into something that doesn't even sound good. For the most part the songs all sound alike. Tweedy's lyrics are delivered in a subdued monotone with random electronic noises thrown in. What happened to the enthusiasm this guy used to have?"
3,Where are the songs?,"This is probably the most brilliantly produced album I've ever heard. The ambient sounds fit perfectly with intrumentation, which is often haunting. Each track has a new and unique texture to it. But ...Where are the songs? Almost all of the songs on this album are so underwritten that they almost aren't even songs--they're just instrumental frameworks in which a song SHOULD be embedded. Sometimes, as in ""Radio Cure,"" the this framework is so genius that you almost forget that Tweedy does little more than repeat the same stanza over and over again.And that might be great, if he had written one heck of an amazing stanza. But most of the songwriting isn't much above the level of a very smart fifteen-year-old kid. If Tweedy had even a somewhat mature sensibility as a songwriter, this album might have been pure gold. But as it is, it leaves you with a hollow aftertaste."
2,Beck lite,"For all the ink spilled by critics in praise of this album, it's no better than mediocre. The album has a few mildly catchy tunes -- ""Poor Places"" and ""Heavy Metal Drummer"" come to mind -- but is a pale imitation of more inventive artists like Beck and Yo La Tengo. ""Yankee Hotel Foxtrot"" is like the shadow cast on the cave wall by Beck's ""Odelay!"" or YLT's ""Then Nothing Turned Itself Inside Out."" Don't waste your money, or more importantly, your time."
5,A classic!,"Yankee Hotel Foxtrot is the first Wilco album I've heard and I love it! This CD is definitely one of my top 5 of 2002. The songs are catchy without being dumb. The lyrics are very thought provoking. The first time I heard the CD I was shocked. It wasn't at all what I was expecting. While it is on the mellow side, Yankee Hotel Foxtrot doesn't become boring.Before I listened to this CD, I suspected the songs would be quiet, folky and dull. While they are quiet and folky at times, they are also very modern. The songs are certainly never dull. These are excellent pop songs. No record collection is complete without the album!"
5,Yankee Hotel Foxtrot,"Early 70's Neil Young meets Pink Floyd meets Bob Dylan, and Beck joins the fray for an ear shattering mix. A must have for any fan of good music, regardless of preferred genre. Go out and buy this, and any album that Jeff Tweedy is involved with. Easily the best, most complete album released this year. Cover to cover it is great. Not a weak track here."
4,excellent cd,"for once the hype is right, this cd is great. their subtle use of tape loops and carefully placed electronic sounds make these songs really take off. they're not trying to hide behind the technology like a lot of lesser bands would and have done, they use it to enhance the music and give it an additional dimension. there is something so indescribably chilling about the ending of ""poor places"" where a woman's voice repeats the album's title over and over again on top of a wall of electronic blips and beeps. every song on this cd is good, there's nothing to skip over, if you like folk music, psychadelic pop or just music in general you should get this cd, you won't be disappointed."
5,Imagine Cloning Blonde On Blonde With Sgt Pepper,What if Bob Dylan joined the Beatles? That is Wilco! Jeff Tweedy is the driving force behind this group. Is Yankee Hotel Foxtrot that good? Can it rank up there with Blonde On Blonde and Sgt Pepper? You decide.
3,"Good, but not a masterpiece",Very good CD compared to most music out today but it is highly overated.
5,Doesn't Get Any Better,"Take the genius of any genre'. Mix in blender. Jeff Tweedy and co. are pure artists. If music could be a painting, this is the cd. All previous Wilco cd's were a warning that this would happen. Pure genius. Where does Mr. Tweedy go from here?"
3,'H'otel 'Y'ankee 'P'apa 'E'cho,"Roger, WILCO copy that: Hotel Yankee papa Echo, Over and out. \Seriously, this CD is not bad, but it's not good either. If it is possible to be relentlessly tepid and mediocre, then Wilco have mastered the art.A few upbeat songs like ""War On War"" are ruined by preachiness. At 5 -- 6 minutes each, many of the songs are far too long, and listless, to hold most listener's attention or interest.Pass on this and wait for the next one, or get the ""Uncle Tupelo"" Best of CD.Hotel-Yankee-Foxtrot is a Delta-Ocean-Gulf (maybe even the #1 Delta-Uniform-Delta of 2002)."
5,"Wonderful, wonderful and wonderful","Purchased this for my 8 year old granddaughter. Wonderful story provided many hours of time together, a step back in time that was delightful. Very fast packing and shipping."
3,Needs battery,"The first thing when you get the converter is to take the dead battery in to Radio Shack to get a new one, because these were manufactured years ago. With the new battery it works fine."
4,"nice debut, hope to hear more","I heard ""Hockey Skates"" on the radio and knew that any songwriter who worked hockey metaphors into songs was one I'd like. Enjoyed the whole album - the Lucinda and Emmylou comparisons work well enough, but I'd say Kathleen Edwards is more like Garrison Starr at this point - solid, rocking individual songs but not quite a full-album's worth of songs that work as a unified whole...but we can add yet, b/c she (like G-Starr) is still young and will get there - hopefully with the next album."
2,Breathe and Falter,"It takes about fifteen listens to have this album sit where you want it to. For the time being, maybe in the car or maybe in the multi-cd player. It's soon to be sitting on the shelf after you get tired of listening to the breathy voice and help-on-the-writing lyrics.The credits on this album read like a whose who in Canadian rock and pop history. For a girl that got a kick-start from being the 'opening act' to having some fantastic musicians as her original back-up band (Peter Von Alten, Dave Draves & Jim Bryson to name but a few) she certainly hasn't kept her end of the bargain by bringing some of these fantstic musicians on tour with her."
2,xanax without the fun part,"I am late to the Dining Rooms party, and apparently haven't been missing much despite the 5-star reviews on Amazon. There is a difference between chilled (which I love) and comatose, which except for a couple of tracks toward the end of this disc would certainly be an apt description. There is no there there."
3,"Panasonic CD/MP3, Hard Drive Player","Good ProductOur use is specific - office based -- and it appears to work -piping music into different rooms - though because bass is on a different channel, lacks the bass response in these other rooms which are wired with paired wiring. Also realize it appears toneed to have a TV attached to take advantage of full programming capabilities."
2,Should not be available to the public,"This feel like a beta release. Which would be fine if it were software, but it's hardware! My iPod sounds fine for a while, then suddenly it's very scratchy and fuzzy. The CD player locks up constantly. And finally, when you hit ""power"" there's a good :30 lag before it powers up. I have not done the firmware update on it. Hoping that fixes things... On a good note, the sound is nice, the remote is very well designed, and the unit looks slick."
4,Good product!,"This fan was received as ordered and is a high quality, USA made fan with a heavy duty electrical cord. It should last a very long time."
5,"Powerful little fan, very quiet","Perfect for our needs. I wanted a quiet fan that can run at night in a small bedroom. We moved to Hawaii recently where fans are a must, but I didn't want the sound of a fan motor overpowering the sound of the ocean waves. This little fan fit all the criteria."
2,Buyer beware - Quit Working After 14 months,"Bought this last year, it's been sitting on my desk at work since then. Worked fine until yesterday when I turned on the fan and the blades would not turn, it just makes a humming noise. I've tried to bring it back to life, but not luck so far."
5,"Great, great little fan!",I absolutely love this little fan! It is so quiet that we use it while it sits inside our bed headboard at night during the summer! I only wish the larger models were as quiet!
2,Done Right != Taught Right,"One might guess a title claiming ""Linear Algebra Done Right"" would have aimed for maximum clarity, insight, and applicability, and for minimum gratuitous proof, abstract language, or wasted verbiage. Well,... About the M-th time the book proves that some new operator applied to nothing still yields nothing, and the K-th time it makes an unmotived leap that vectors and polynomials are alike, you give up hope. A lot of people gave this book 4 or 5 stars, suggesting an approachable, inspiring read. Didn't realize the 'in' joke was the rating was a linear transform: y = 6 - x."
3,"Just a gadget, buy it for fun, not for serious study.","I do not think this book should be complemented by any other books; it is an unnecessary complement to any other books. Buy this for fun, not for a serious study. I just regard this book as a gadget. As the author said, he never had other books beside him when writing this book; I do not think this is the right atitude for writing a book."
4,I love my 350 headset.,"My Jabra350 bluetooth headset is great, the reception is very good and the ear piece is a comfortable fit. My plan is to make several more purchases for upcoming birthdays.ThanksDeborah Robinson"
2,Ja-Blah!,"When i first bought into bluetooth fone technology i was sold but beware there are drawbacks! First the Ja-Blah errr Jabra Bt350 is a good headset if you do not know much about bluetooth. Connectivity! it is there. it seems to do the basic stuff ok....but when you demand more from it like crystal clear calls or reception away from phone...look for another earpeice! this device gets static @ 5 or more ft...the echoes you get are nothing short of what past reviewers say about it..when u buy a product you want it to work @ least 90% of time not 70%..Always remember to do you homework when buying these devices b/c they are expensive(cost as much as many cell phones!)...buy earpices from companies who actually make cell phones(motorola for example)..they tend to understand the ""reception game"" a little better....happy hunting!"
1,worst,I would give this product zero stars if I could. Not only did the product malfunction and jabra refuse to take it back because I didn't have a reciept but the customer service guy got snappy with me as well. I will never buy another jabra product.
3,Head set,"What makes this product good is Jabra's customer service. I purchased it and within a month it did not work, but Jabra was prompt about sending me a new one which has worked wonderfully. Aside from when there is bad wind out side its great!"
2,It's the Pentium II/Windows 95 of Bluetooth. Buy an upgrade.,"I've had mine for six months and no longer use it with my Treo 650 because I work in active, noisy environments. I have to press it into my ear and cup my other hand around the mic. It would be okay for a sedentary employee working alone in a quiet office. Another problem is that if I turn my head at all while working or driving, it feels like it's going to fall off, which it has on many occasions. I like the other reviewer's comment about the distracting blue strobe reflection while driving at night (I've felt your pain, brother). It's the perfect re-gift for someone who has never used a Bluetooth;-) Today I'm buying the Plantronics Voyager 510, which has better reviews. Stay tuned."
3,Jabra Headset,"The Jabra BT350 Bluetooth headset is comfortable and easy to use. However, I have been told many times by persons that I am speaking to that words are ""clipped off"" at the end and it is hard to understand me at times. I do not have this problem with a plug-in headset."
4,My first McCaffrey Book,"This was the first book by Anne McCaffrey I read, before I even knew about her other, great Sci-fi books. I found it to have a great storyline, I loved the characters, and the characters of the horses. A great book for kids from about 12 to adults."
4,good comparative analysis vis-a-vis Microsoft,"The total cost of operation of linux on the desktop is a big theme of the book. While Haletky does go into how to install linux and various common applications, like OpenOffice, this book differs from most linux texts. He discusses at length the realities of users already having legacy documents, and experience, with Microsoft applications. Especially Microsoft Office. While OpenOffice can do the most common tasks that Microsoft Office does, it cannot do many specialised operations. If you have specific need for the latter, you should stay with Microsoft.There are certainly pros and cons associated with moving from Microsoft to linux. Haletky gives a lucid and balanced treatment of these. Migration ""might"" save you money. But it is by now means a given."
3,"Great screen size, slim, not a good view angle","The size of the screen is great. Once installed does not take a lot of room, is quite slim. Resolution is not that great. The view is dark from the second row, specially for the side passengers. The third row seats have the best view. Recomended for larger vehicles with a third row seat. ."
1,Zelco Fluorescent Booklight,I have bought 2 Zelco Fluorescent booklights and had bothfail after several months usage. The product is unreliable.
1,Do not buy this product!,"I bought this Light back in november and it is no longer working,i spent 35+ dollors on this product and it only lastest about 3 months what a rip off!!"
2,Wonder what BMW this mug was made for?,"Not mine... this mug didn't even remotely fit. Way too big for the Z4, and it leaked from Day One. It promptly went right back."
3,"Gainax's riff on Anime Culture, or...","to quote Douglas Adams: ""Mostly Harmless""I'm a parent. I'm ""left of center"". And this review is from the perspective of a father of two teenage boys.The older boy (19) would find it amusing, if he didn't have to pay for it. The younger boy(14), would probably ""go steady"" with this particular tome until he started to shave on a regular basis.The Pros: Fan Service!, Anime ""in"" jokes, Japanese cultural jokes. Good art. Interesting scenarios. Well endowed ""maidens"".The Cons: One suspects the dialog was funnier in Japanese. as somebody fameous once said: ""Dying is easy. Comedy is hard."" There's quite a bit of nudity and, ah, ""adult situations"" in this one (more like ""male fantasy sequences"").Think: Fooli Cooli with ""babes"", a more coherent ""plot"", and lest angst.Buy If: you're into anime, don't like thinking too much, and well endowed (semi) naked women is your thing. And 14. And have parents with a sense of humor.Otherwise, I'd have to give this 3 stars."
3,depth was lacking,"I was disapointed in reading this bio.It left so many things unanswered, in my opinion.Mr.Novarro deserved something more than a thumbnail sketch of his life.I felt that the author skimmed the reader through Mr.Novarros' life.I came away knowing mostly that he was Gay, and had a drinking problem.Not much of a legacy,not much of anything else.The author might read Marie Dresslers' recent bio, or William Haines' bio, or ""Charles Chaplin, the man and his times"" to understand how details add so much to the overall read, itself."
2,okay,"when I got this dvd it said it was in good condiction, well when i opened it up, it was scrached really bad, me and my fanicee put it in the dvd player and it started skipping really bad. it didnt even play after playing the first 10 minutes. Thankfully he knows how to clean dvds, after spending about 20 minutes cleaning it, trying to get the scraches out if finally worked. i wouldnt buy from these people again. i was very disspointed. the dvd was so scrached up i couldnt even watch it. and i had to waste my time trying to clean it just so i could.i will not be buying from these people again."
1,A very diasppointed book!!!!!,"At the moment I first received this book, I was already felt disappointed as the book is a tiny one with fewer than 200 pages. I predicted that this book would not give much information on Newton, undisputably the greatest scientist and mathematician of all time!! ( Don't compare Einstein with him , the later can only be described as the greatest theoretical physicist of the 20 th century!) Considering Newton's achievement and his complicated life, a book ten times the content of this one even may not be enough!After reading the whole book, I was even more disappointed!! As the description of Newton's life is even less than any book on History of Mathematics!! Coupled with the expensiveness of this book. ( It cost me more than 60 dollars ) I cannot think of one reason to buy this book. I recommend "" the life of Issac Newton or for a more detailed account, "" Never at rest,"" both by Richard Westfall."
1,I quit after a few dozen pages,"I enjoy books about the end of the world. I always have. When I stumbled across Hand's book I was pleased. Her book was one I had not yet read...and I won't be finishing it. I have only read several dozen pages so I freely admit my view of the book is limited. The characters are all unlikeable. Things that should have been explained never were. Christians are routinely called ""Xians"". What? Apparently hip Christians are called Xians. O...kay. I finally tossed in the towel when a character - the only interesting one by the way - starts having sex with a Xian rock star in a planetarium. Yeah, sure. That was annoying enough, but previously she had been described as being perhaps 14 years old. Yep, that was it for me."
2,Not what I expected,"Based on the praise in the media for this novel, I was practically salivating when I finally sat down to being the novel. I was particularly interested in how Hand saw trends in the environment, in sociology and in art playing themselves out. While she met my expectations in this area, offering the reader a well developed view of the future, there was no real story for these ideas to be set in. Every time I found myself settling into a story line, I was ripped away and transplanted somewhere else. There was no clear beginning, middle or end and while I usually buy into the idea that the writer uses tchniques like that to ilicit an emotion from the reader, I think that in this case, it was a result of poor planning or writing. In general, I was disappointed."
3,Stylistic but obscure novel.,"Elizabeth Hand is a wonderful stylist, but her plots really don't make much sense. She writes a brooding, pessimistic, rambling tale that ultimately doesn't come together. Enjoy her novel for its powerful images, but it's the equivalent of a rock video."
1,Jumbled mish-mash that garbles its promise,Where's the emotions and motivations for this contorted mess? Great camera work and suberb dramatic talent wasted on a plot that defies logic.
5,Extremely interesting,It is a book that should be read at least once in our lives. What I also really appreciate is the Cd attached to the book for the correct pronunciation in Sanskrit
2,This is a childrens shirt!!!,This is a childrens size shirt. This information was not provided to me when I initialy ordered it. This XL is smaller than a mens small!! I'm returning it this week.
4,best unsigned artist-don't pass this up!,just had the opportunity to see nicole gordon open for sophie b hawkins and WHAT A TALENT!! she writes great songs and has a beautiful beautiful voice. pick up this CD and see if it doesn't become a favorite.
4,It feels like an older sister is coaching me to blossom!,"Judy Hollis candidly shares a lifetime of personal and professional experiences in this manual for women seekers. Somehow, I never ran into a sister, friend or slumber-party pal who says it like it is...or could be... when women indulge in the pleasures of food and sex for nourishment, without guilt. I'm savoring every page; thanks judy!"
1,It's Too Clever by Half,"This device is infuriating. I want to be able to change channels while continuing to record (whatever new channel I change to). It is impossible to do in any practical way. It forces you to quit recording if you want to change channels, overly protecting you from yourself. At the same time, if you run out of tape while recording, it disables numerous functions on the VCR and never gives you any clue as to why. You can't even then display the tape position or counter. You will think your equipment is broken. Finally, it integrates very poorly with the same manufacturer's TV. I would love to get my money back."
1,Anolon Nylon Whisk,"WELL, HERE I AM COMPLAINING ABOUT THE 3RD ANALON KITCHEN TOOLS I PURCHASED.. ITS THE SAME OLD STORY. MAYBE IF I WAS FIXING A GIANT BOWL OF CREAMED POTATOES FOR SAY, ""PAUL BUNYON"", IT MIGHT BE OKAY. TAKE A GOOD LOOK AT HOW THICK THE TINES ARE ON THIS! GIGANTIC ! I TRULY BELIEVE THIS WAS A BIG MISTAKE. SORRY ANALON!!!"
3,tiny in every way,"The Zelco Brisk Brew is the tiniest coffeemaker on the market. I looked for weeks in the stores and never found anything smaller or more convenient to fit in our luggage.It really comes in handy in a pinch. The only problem is after you brew one cup, you have to wait for it to cool off( about ten minutes) before you can brew another one.It's great for a single coffee drinker, but not very practical for a couple."
5,Having Faith,"Anyone concerned about the health of future generations should read this, not just mothers. Sandra Steingraber writes with a scientist's authority and a poet's evocative language to instill a respect for the fragile and complex developmental process of the fetus and newborn infant. She reveals the environmental threats to that process and calls for protections as a basic human right."
4,Great Mix of Science and Love,"This book starts out as very scientific and a bit dull, but picks up and keeps you reading. I admire the author for doing so much detailed research and yet being very happy and optimistic towards her own childbearing. An inspirational and eye-opening book that I would recommend to all my friends, especially young women."
2,Don't waste your money,"I bought this unit to get an ATSC tuner cheap and to be able to record shows. Well, it kind of works, but nothing is great. The remote control is terrible. Its credit card sized and gets lost real easy. It also doesn't control much. The television guide is generic and comes from (...). You have to sign in and scroll on the internet with your mouse which is a nuisance to me because it should work with the remote, but it doesn't. You can't even click on a show and go to it. The remote control has to be directly in front of the box to work, also. This unit is cheap and you get what you pay for. I thought it would pause and rewind live TV, but it won't for me. There are so much better products than this out there so pay a little more and be much happier."
4,Makes Sense,This book focuses on being more mindful by practicing meditation. The author provides four mantras for you to use when focusing on your mate. It is an easy to read book and would be most beneficial if both partners read the book.
3,Short,"With such a small book you'd expect it to be straight to the point, but with this book it sometimes gets a bit repetitive. Personally, I enjoyed Paulo Coelho's ""Eleven Minutes"" more when it came to this topic of Love."
5,One of the most influential books of the 20th century,"This book was considered THE handbook for christian missions in the early part of the 20th century. It is lsited by William and Randy Petersen as one of the 100 most influential Christian books of last century. If you can find it, read it!"
4,Tito and Celia's 1st album together!,"Just listen to the first track! Puente's band is like a dynamo. His big band seemed to be augmented with extra percussionists for this hot date. Celia is in top form here and she handles the different styles and rhythms thrown at her very well.Although very different from her later sessions with Johnny Pacheco in the 70's, these sessions are essential listening for fans of Celia and Puente's big band sound.Very well recorded. This reissue has great liner notes and good remastered sound."
2,Too flimsy for older kids,"The toy is cute but not durable. We bought it for a costume party, not even to play with and many things were broken in one night."
2,Cheap,"I paid $20 for this and in one day all that is left that isnt broken is the hat and hook. I dont recommend this, although my son loves wearing the pirate hat all the time."
2,Look closely at the picture,"The shoes are fine but the color was not what we expected. Look closely at the picture and enlarge it. It is two toned and pretty drastic. If you like those things, it will be fine, I was expecting a very subtle two tone."
2,Cute but tips over,"We used this in our pool. Everyone thinks it's funny and cute. Problem is, as soon as you open it it tilts over and dumps the drinks and ice in the pool LOL. Floats well though."
4,Dover reprint of good cloisonne enamel work,"This is one of those books that you are giddy that Dover reprinted! it isn't for the very beginner in enameling but it will take the enameler thru all the steps for making some basic cloisonnes and then the settings and chains for them. The jewelry working/metal smithing section is worth the price of admission. The chain making section is old school just enough to get people thinking about the need for all the fancy gizmo's they sell today. I enjoyed the book as a whole. the B&W pictures are good being reprints. the project drawings, pictures and the wire bend diagrams are great. To bad more of the newer books don't include them. The resource pages were very complete and you will find most of them still doing biz and with web sites. If you have old Thompson Enamels you have picked up from some ole timer the list with numbers will be worth the cost itself. I own it, use it"
1,Plastic Junk,"This item sucks, got it, broke second time I tried using it. Simply do not buy this overpriced piece of plastic."
1,I should have read the reviews before ordering,"It took longer to unpack the lock from the box it came in than it did to have the lock break. (Less than 3 minutes.) This is worse than junk (junk doesn't cost twenty-dollars). I can't believe the beating I took on this item. I still think the idea is great. But ""plastic"" for a door lock? So much for twenty-dollars."
3,Great music. Audio mastering is terrible.,"I'm very sorry to report that as an audiophile, I find this DVD very difficult to listen to. There's a sound compressor with hideous settings and the audio level varies constantly and unpredictably throughout every song. As soon as Jeff starts singing the level of all the other instruments drops down, then bounces back up. Very distracting.To my ear the only problem is the compression. Everything else sounds otherwise fine. I have no idea how this mistake passed the quality control department."
3,...,"I've allways been a fan of Jeff Lynne's musical stylisms and songwriting ever since The Move and ELO except for ELO's disco/pop derailment. This current recording has some good songs,good playing,nice vocal & guitar sounds. This is a generally good sounding CD but I can't understand how it fits into today's music market(this not a put down,just an observation). I give it 3 stars because the sonic quality of this recording is lacking. It sounds flat and choked. With a more open sounding, dynamic sound,I could give it a higher rating! But then, I'm only an old fan."
3,An Exercise in ...,"Having been a fan of the Electric Light Orchestra since the middle '70's I was eager for the release of this album. The set is reminisent of Jeff Lynne at his best. Dominated by pure pop, the songs are well produced and very listenable. But if you were expecting the tight group of musicians of the past, look elsewhere. The only member of the past band present for this outing is Richard Tandy on the first song. Ringo Starr and George Harrison also make guest appearances on a couple of numbers each, but not together. Instead, Jeff Lynne plays all instruments and even supplies his own backing vocals. While well done, it makes you wonder what the previous band actually did, if Jeff can do it all by himself."
3,"Good, but not the ELO I like","The music is excellent, but it is not the ELO I like. Jeff Lynn was either not really into it or he was trying to give it a different sound other than ""ELO"". TIME was the last album that I completely liked. Even the stuff Jeff worked on with Tom Petty was better than ZOOM. Sorry, but not what I expected."
3,Jeff Lynne's Second Solo Album,"After a gap of over 10 years, a new album is released. Jeff Lynne is ELO, but he should not have used his old group's name on this effort.It's not as accessable as his first solo album(1990), which had fine cover versions of ""September Song"" and ""Stormy Weather"", plus the haunting ""Now You're Gone"" and his best post ELO song ""Blown Away"". Zooming in on the 13 songs of the album, this is a very familiar Lynne-production. But I think he's rocking too much with his guitar on most of the songs. I get the feeling that something is missing here. Where's the choir and the strong string arrangements? I would rather have more ballads than these average rock songs. However there's two standout songs here, ""Moment In Paradise"" and ""Ordinary Dream"". If the material had been in this direction, I would have been pleased. Sorry Jeff!"
3,Is this Armchair Theatre Part 2?,Nice album - cool tunes - but it lacks the magic that has been ELO. While it should not matter that none of the others made it on the record - it just seems to be hollow.
3,Sizing may be a problem,"I have an 11lb dog, a bishion shih tzu mix and the small seemed to BIG, lengthwise and around her neck so I purchased an extra small which seemed to fit lengthwise but was entirely to small around her abdobmen. I kept the small and plan to make alterations around the neck part, as of right now she can wiggle and put her front paws through it. The padding is really nice and the clips work great. I would suggest getting a seperate latch for the seatbelt, what dog wants to sit plastered to the back of a seat?"
2,Sizing is crazy,"The small fits 15-30lb dogs and is just the tiniest bit too small for our dogs. So we ordered the medium. Unfortunately the medium is at least 3 times the size of the small. It says it's for 35-60lb dogs, but I'd say 50+. What a weird gap in sizing."
3,Missing One Disc,This was a great buy EXCEPT for the fact that it came missing Tomb Raider 4: The Last Revelation. All of the games work fine and are easy to install. Other then the fact that it was missing one game; it was a decent purchase.
3,Dive into Genetics,Descent amount of information and presented in a comprehendable way. I recommend it for anyone trying to dive into the realm of genetics.
3,A Must Have For True Fates Warning Fans!!!,"Please keep in mind that Fates Warning was NOT the headliners of this show, so they did not have fancy lighting, or good sound production. The video looks ok live in my opinion but watching Fates Warning play live is worth it in itself! These guys are so underrated and talented that all who watch will learn what real musicianship is all about! There are no special features and thier set is very short, but it is a must for true Fates Warning fans(like me)!"
3,You may have problems playing this disc,"Although the description states ""for playback device only"", my experience was that this disc would not play in my region 1 player. It did, however, play on my computer using Realplayer. So be advised. The only other disc that ever gave me this problem was a Brazilian ""all regions"" disc. for a 1977 TV movie, this is surprisingly good. But that's only to say that it exceeds very limited expectations. The movie tries to dish dirt at the same time it also presents a sympathetic view of a defective human in power. The dirt is the same old dirt and they try to downplay it by having characters repeat it as hearsay. They make a point of showing his original office and home, but they are not integrated into the action. Just a flashby of Hoover highpoints, they never create an engaging plot based on the surviving files."
1,Hated it!,"This was awful. Yes, like everyone mentioned there are a lot of ""hot"" sex scenes, but that's it and even that seemed pointless. These characters had absolutely no personality. It was almost comical to me when the author wrote in a dog for the hero--hmmm...perhaps to make him seem like a real person? But even that didn't fix it. How `bout giving the characters some real emotions?"
1,unromantic and flat,"very tall and rich heiress running away from brutal would be fiance..hiding on a riverboat has frequent sex with its captain. if i wasn't told this was a historical, never would have known from the feel of it. the sex was cold and casual, the characters equally so. the plot could have been a wonderful vehicle for romance and suspense...instead, the story was dull and the characters unsympathetic and tepid. felt much the same with her 1st book, but hoped her 2nd work would be 'warmer'...NOT...the best part of her books...THE COVERS!"
4,Hot and spicy,"I loved this book. Sure there were continutiy problems. Sure the female hiding as a male has been done before, but wow! The sex was hot and plentiful. Donovan and Viola came back to visit and the parents got their just desserts. I think if you like the old Thea Devine (when she actually wrote stores with good sex scenes) then you'll like this book."
3,Avenging Angel Video,Have wanted this video for quite awhile. It was new in the box and was just as described. Very happy with my purchase.
3,worth viewing,this dvd depicts a part of the mormon history that they wish forgotten.but is a watchable film.berenger is good value.
3,Chronicle of Mr Warren Buffet ...,"As such books on Warren Buffet are sparse. So far Warren Buffet hasn't written any book's either. (Probably his Annual Reports are the only direct sources for getting insights into his investing sytle.). So for the Warren Buffet fans, anything you can find about Warren Buffet is valuable.This book chronicle's Warren Buffet's life right from his early childhood to the present day Value Investor. The author has done a nice job of bringing out Warren Buffet's strategy of investing long term in companies based on their intrinsic value. This book also delves into his personal life to some extent as well. Warren Buffet's sketch derived based on comments from his close allies like Charlie Munger and others is also interesting.The book is written in plain and simple manner. Overall it is an interesting read.-Sachin"
5,An All-around Great Book,"This is a fantastic book. It gets you thinking about investing. As you read the story, you become more and more confident in Buffett's ability and more hopeful for yourself. The simple, practical principles that Buffett applies are easily recognized in this straight-forward work. The only problem is containing your excitement. The possibilities for financial success are unlimited. This tells a miraculous story."
5,Great Book with a complete list of exercises for all golfers,"This book has excellent pictures with easy to follow exercises. This book is like no other because it goesthrough practically every muscleto buildstrength in.She goes over how to work-out the quadriceps, outer thigh muscles, back, shoulders. This helped me to increasemy clubhead speed.I also highly recommend,The Ultimate Golf Instruction Guide: Key Techniques forBecoming a Zero Handicap Golfer or Better(author is Patrick Leonardi).The second book helped me to play consistently good at golf. Ithas extremely effective techniques.Blackburn's book helped me to gain strength, which contributed to me hitting the ball further."
1,Aerobics Class Meets Golf?,"Not much on how to put together a program, mostly exercise photos, most of which appear to be exercises from the aerobics class at my club. Elite? My oppinion is NOT!"
3,not bad,This is a good for basic information. We gave this to our son and we will see if it actually works for him!
4,Helpful,I was told I needed to purchase this for my internship at college. I was not thrilled about it. I have to admit it has been very helpful not only to complete my assignments but for what I will need to know when I graduate college.
2,I did not like it,"I bought this mirror based on positive feedbacks..well,now I can write my own feedback, and its negative-I did not like the mirror at all-I am not even sure that it s made from glass, not clear to see and changing from one to another is a chore. I will return it to the store and get something more stable. Besides, it was a poor quality and too big to attach to the wall mirror."
3,okay cd,I have to agree w/another reviewer that this cd is kind of boring w/out the actual gameplay and beautiful/creepy scenery to go w/it. It's still good to listen to before you go to bed (puts you right to sleep) ;) but I'm hoping that the Riven soundtrack will be better.
5,It's A Shame!,"Damon Johnson & crew: more talent in one note than any lame alternative band. It's a shame the record label didn't promote this band and its potential. This album is where music should be going. Too bad kids today don't have a skilled musician like Bro. Cane's Johnson for inspiration. Guess there was no ""gimmick"", just good music. For those of you with a true taste for rock and roll, pick this (or any B. Cane) album up and call Virgin records and tell them how you feel!"
4,Vintage Mattau,Good period movie with fine performances by Mattau and Glenda Jackson. Mattau plays a Doctor who must choose between empty relationships with young sexpots or a good older woman. Guess who wins. Good representation of films of that era.
1,I actually love the movie which I have viewed many years ago but couldn't play the DVD I received,"I couldn't play it. A message came up saying ""wrong region"". How can I tell what region when II am ordering?"
3,Inexpensive View of Early Childhood Research Literature,"In this Book, Spodek gives us a thorough overview of the most pertinent topics facing early childhood in 2005 from parent involvement, to reading instructional methods, to developmentally appropriate curriculums. At the end of each entry, Spodek gives an extensive bibliography of the most significant contributions in that area from the most historically relevant to the most recent research thrusts.On the other hand, the book may not arrest the typical teacher as much as the Early Childhood M.Ed. or Ph.D. due to its technical jargon and theoretical arguments. A typical classroom teacher may find the information daunting, somewhat hard to penetrate, and unrelated to their immediate classroom needs.On the whole, this book offers wonderful up-to-date insights on scholarly research in the field especially for academians."
4,What I expected,"it met my expectations, in line with Lonely Planet's quality and Amazon's prices and delivery service."
2,um pouco usado,"Demasiado usado, e um pouco sujo. Mas pelo preo no se pode esperas melhor, esta okEncontra-se estruturalmente intacto. A capa esta um bocado maada"
2,Road Sweeper,"Didn't fit any of the vehicles we thought it would of the same scale as the sweeper. Came with adapters but none fit the bruder toys we bought the sweeper to go on. The sweeper did go on a Ertyl John Deere tractor but would fall off very easily.Good thing it wasn't too pricey, it has pretty much been in the bottom of the toy box since I bought it for the grand kids. It does look realistic though."
5,The best from Eddie's Tico albums.,"This is an excellent compilation of Eddie's hits for Tico Records. While this CD is well-mastered, it has no liner notes whatsoever (this is outrageous when you consider this music's importance). I highly recommend this CD because it contains the classics ""Cafe"", ""Viejo Socarron"", ""Lazaro Y Su Microfono"", ""Tirandote Flores"" and ""Justicia"". Nonetheless, it goes without saying that his ""Molasses"", ""Champagne"", ""Super-imposition"", ""Azucar Pa' Ti"" and ""Vamonos Pa'l Monte"" albums are must-have CDs for any serious salsero."
4,Almost Perfect..!,"This is Ambient music in high class-relax,close your eyes ,and listen to this beautiful music from the top selling game RIVEN ! If you like`d the background-music in the game,this is a Winner!"
3,creative ideas,"My honest opinion is that this book is basically on the internet. I've seen at least about 40% of these styles and artworks on the net and around. What the author has done is just basically compiled it together to make it easier. Thats all.If i used google, i could type the brand's name in and hook it to advert or something voila, it would be up in Google Images."
3,Great contents ... poor manufacturing,I really like the contents of this book. Which is great because the contents are literally spilling out all over my desk. Within days this book starting falling apart. I am considering having it drilled and riveted.
4,Phat like that CD!!,"C-BO's ""Til My Casket Drops"" is the first CD i have actually ever heard of C-BO. Before this, i heard him on a song he did with Brotha Lynch and Tech N9ne.Anyways, after hearing this album, now i see why this CD was so controversial; however, i don't think it was enough for him to go to jail over. The lyrics are phat, and there are some kick@ss guest appearances on the CD; ranging from Spice 1 to E-40. My fav songs on it are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 7. C-BO ain't no Esham or Ice-T, but ""Til' My Casket Drops"" is worth the money!"
3,"""Swiss"" Torx knife","Great addition to my toolbox. Has T-9/10/15/20/25/27/30&40 sizes. Bits made from Vanadium steel. Made in America by Michigan Industrial Tools. The only down side is the holder assembly is plastic, so take care not to over torque, as the assembly could break. Have used it many times now and find it a very handy accessory to have available."
5,Great map for the High Sierra Trail,"Normally I would agree with the other reviewers that this map might not be detailed enough for a backcountry trip. However, I just completed the 72 mile High Sierra Trail, and because the trail is so well marked this map would have sufficed. We brought this and reams of other maps I had printed for multiple sections from my TOPO! program and barely even looked at them--we eventually used them for fire starter and just used this map, mostly to identify surrounding peaks and get a rough idea of what was in store for the next day. If you're going cross country and need to do any tricky navigating then I would agree that you need to supplement this with more detailed topo maps, but this gives a great overview and is nicely shaded. It's also very sturdy."
2,should have returned,"I should have just taken the time to return this. It is good quality and seems durable, however the prongs are just a little too short, so spearing food is not as convenient as I would hope it to be. Definitely disappointing for the price. Can't bring myself to toss it, so it just sits in the drawer. At least the roommate got to take it camping once. He didn't care for it much, but it was more practical than carrying a spoon and fork!"
4,Im Impressed,"I have never really been a fan of the Stone Roses but i have to say that i am a fan of all Ian Browns solo work. Golden Greats is an excellent album containing the hit singles Dolphins Were Monkeys (my Favourite), Love Like A Fountain and Golden Gaze. The album also contains top songs like First World and Set My Baby Free. This album should appeal to all of the Stone Roses fans, and appeal to a new fan base showing that Ian Brown was the man that made the Stone Roses what they were"
1,Kindle edition extremely disappointing,Prof Alter has made a great contribution but the publisher has done him a gross disservice:there are no hyperlinks to the notes. Navigating between the text and Alter's notes is totally critical! The publisher should finish the job properly and then Amazon should alert anyone who has purchased the work that an updated version is available.Buy hard copy for now.
3,Questionable,"The King James version of Numbers, on which about fifty English scholars agreed more than four centuries ago, translates the verse in which Moses excepts virgins from the slaughter of his wife’s tribe as “But all the women children, that have not known a man by lying with him, keep alive for yourselves.” The New International version, on which about a hundred scholars all over Earth agreed less than four decades ago, translates that verse as “But save for yourselves every girl who has never slept with a man.” But this version, by one Jewish scholar who claimed it was superior to any other when he published it less than one decade ago, omits the phrase ""for yourselves."""
5,Something Actually Useful!,"I found this book useful for developing your channeling abilities. Unlike many books by popular publishers, this book is based on work of a real psychic, who actually knew what he was talking about. The writer of this book did a nice job explaining the meanings of Cayce's words and providing exercises for the reader to explore for himself."
5,Probably the only time I will like Sex and the City SJP,Probably the only time I will like Sex and the City SJP because in this movie she will make you laugh so hard you will cry I love sitting down to watch this movie on Halloween with a big bowl of candy. So just this time SJP good job because you suck at your other movies :)
4,"Fun, Halloween Classic","I am personally not big on scary movies, so my options are limited at Halloween. When I found this movie I was sceptical at first, but then found myself sucked into the fun!The Sanford sisters are very funny, played by Bette Midler, Sarah Jessica Parker and another very funny lady. The costumes are great, and Thora Birch who plays the sister of the main character does a great job, and I am hard to impress with child actors.It's good for a holiday spooky and funny movie, there is a bit of mature language for small children though, depending on how protective you are of your children, and some dark ideas, but this is typical of Halloween. It's now a classic in my collection."
5,This movie is great,"Came in great condition, and great timing. This is a wonderful Halloween classic that is great for every age. I watch it every Halloween"
2,"Good,but could be better!","This film is good to watch only on halloween,I really liked Thora Birch, but not in this film.Some of the ""magic"" stuff they did was impressing.But its a film you could get bored of in weeks."
1,DVD would not play all the way through,"The movie is fantastic; that is why I purchased it. However, at scene topic 12, the video suddenly stopped playing. There was nothing to indicate a damaged DVD, so I assume it came from Walt Disney Production. I tried to play the DVD in my computer where Disney's own player was installed. However, the player shut down my virus protection; I had to restart my computer to clean up the mess.As I had to open the DVD to play it, I am unable to return it.My rating only reflects on the poor condition of the DVD, not the movie. That I give 5 stars"
3,A fun family Halloween movie finally in HD,"Hocus Pocus finally comes to Blu ray with a pretty ok transfer. It overall is soft, close ups have the best detail. The transfers clean up is great, no dirt or scratches that I could see. It is great improvement over the non anamorphic DVD that has been out for many years.Bette Midler, Kathy Najimy, and Sarah Jessica Parker as the three witches are great. The highlight of the movie.No extras, kind of a bummer.Over all I give it 3 stars for the soft, but good transfer and no extras. I think it is worth picking up if you're looking for a fun family Halloween movie."
5,Hocus Pocus,Hocus Pocus: This is a great movie at halloween. The cast really looks the part. It is alot of fun to watch.
4,Great Movie!,This movie is great for people of all ages. It really gets you into the halloween spirit!. I reccommend this movie to anyone who loves halloween!
4,Great Halloween Comedy,"I loved this movie.....too many good things to mention them all....Bette Midler was terrific (OK...they could have done without the chipmunk teeth) and the plot was the purfect story for Halloween. Loved the soundtrack (particularly Midler's ""I Put A Spell On You"") which of course is my primary beef....What happened to it? Wanted to add it to my collection but apparentally it was never released (although the end credits say there was one). Does anyone know out there?"
5,Awesome,"I'm a 16 yr old who still watches Disney(So sue me, I hate MTV and the Pop rage). I never knew this movie was in theatres until I read these reviews! I just finished watching Hocus Pocus on TV tonight and thought I'd look it up on Amazon to see if it were on DVD/VHS. This movie is a classic, and I watch it every time it comes on. I have the soundtrack, which consists of like 2 songs, on Kazaa Media. It's the greatest halloween movie of the 90s for kids, and even teenagers, because I know alot of kids at school like it as well. Hope this review will help someone out! I would recommend this movie to anyone-my dad says it's one of the few things SJP did that was decent acting, lol!"
4,WE LOVE IT!!,"We have rented this movie about 1000 times. This is the movie my 3 year old wants to rent everytime we go to the movie rental store. It is a funny movie with lots of neat special effects that kids of all ages enjoy. The only negative thing I can say about it is that the word ""virgin"" is used several times in the movie. When my 9 year old asked me what that word meant, I had a hard time answering her. Other than that, I really like the movie alot."
3,Inexplicably beloved and rather bad,"The Bottom Line:Bette Midler works overtime trying to infuse this featherlight kids movie with some desperately-needed energy, but the sloppy editing, weak child acting, uninteresting storyline and lukewarm direction by choreographer and schlock-merchant Kenny Ortega make this a film to skip.2/4"
3,Didn't arrive on proper date; shipping route wacky and out of control!,"My sister and I have loved Hocus Pocus since we were girls; and I ordered it for her for Halloween this year. It was supposed to arrive today for the holiday; but not only did it not arrive; when I went to the ""track your package"" link here on Amazon; it showed a departure from the site in West Virginia, but the next thing it showed was an arrival date in Kansas City, KS; completely bypassing Illinois! It would have had to go through the region in Illinois in which we live to get from one site to the other! This is completely ridiculous. I have never had a problem like this from Amazon before and I hope not to again; but I am very disappointed and unhappy with the shipping mishaps I have experienced with this order."
5,Hocus Pocus,"I purchased the movie for my mother-in-law. It is one of her favorite movies. I don't particularly care for the movie, but she wanted it for Christmas and loved it."
4,Good fun!,This movie is good fun and entertaining enough to appeal to kids and adults alike! Would recommend and watch again.
4,Very strong story line---the witches are good actresses,"the main actors--the kids--sadly--aren't up to par with a lot of the others in talent. Taken for looking good on camera than acting ability. The movie is still pretty good, with a great script and story line. The ending is completely predictable, but then what in hollywood isn't?---A fun family movie all in all."
2,LAZY Disney applies no special features AGAIN!!,Disney is becoming very lazy when it comes to the addition of special features for their blu-ray releases. Just look at The Avengers. It made over $600 million and they put minimal special features on it. Poor show Disney home video.
5,Great movie for kids...classic witch tale,Annual tradition to watch this every Halloween. Not too long and always comical to watch. I would recommend this to kids and adults although there are slight adult themes I'm there
1,Mayan??,"I didn't bother watching the movie, as the title left me dubious about the quality of it. The Mayans were in Central America, nowhere near Peru. The INCA were the major tribe in Peru."
5,This item is amazing!,"There can't be a better designed and operating grill cleaner than the Grillfloss. It does exactly what the title says... it flosses the bars of the grill grate. There's a dual size cleaning head which perfectly fits the size of my Weber. Two swipes (one forward, and one back after turning the handle a half-turn) and ALL of the crust and build-up is GONE. I could not improve on this if I tried. It's worth the money, BRAVO"
3,Meh. Better than a brush.,"I find it to be better than a brush, but less useful than a balled up piece of foil. Maybe my grill bars are too small, but I have to go over each bar several times to make sure that I get all sides. It's time consuming and a little hard on the hands.I'm much happier rubbing the grill down with a big ol' ball of foil and then hitting it with the floss for the bottom side only.I think that I'm going to try a grill stone instead."
1,Waste of money!,This product is garbage because it only lasted a week. I printed about 5 pages and then it was empty. With these ink cartridges its hit or miss.
5,Benet's Best A resource without peer,"I have used and enjoyed the earlier editions of this encyclopedia since 1960. As a teacher of high school and college English composition and literature, I need a ready and quick resource for capsule notes students can understand and remember. This book provides comprehensive entries on a vast panoply of topics, authors, and works. Use it like a dictionary, browse and learn. be fascinated by the scope and depth of the coverage. A great work of literary scholarship, yet very easy to use, this edition gives us even greater depth of coverage by updating older information and adding contemporary entries. A joy."
4,Another Solid Entry in this Series,"For those who have had the good fortune of discovering Virgin's ""Pure Moods"" albums, the arrival of each new entry is greeted with much anticipation. ""Instrumental Moods"" was actually, I believe the second album released but many have found it only recently. It differs from the ""Pure"" discs in both aim and style, but is a credible addition to the series. There is considerably more diversity on this disc, with hard-rockin' guitar tracks like Eric Johnson's brilliant ""Cliffs of Dover"" side-by-side with mellow, contemplative tracks like Morricone's ""Gabriel's Oboe."" There's trip-hop, contemporary latin guitar, classic new age, in short: something for everybody. Particular highlights that you might not know previously are Vanessa-Mae's astonishingly beautiful ""Widescreen,"" Neal Schon's driving ""Midnight Express,"" and New Age legends Cusco's ""Montezuma"" (which also apears on ""Pure Moods II."" This disc is worth of both its heratige and a place in your collection"
2,The Big Letdown,"Unfocused, repetitive, and worst of all - boring! What should have been a slam dunk documentary about one of the worst blights on the modern age of politics instead turns out to be a damn shame. Ronnie Earle, the district attorney at the center of the film, says, ""This isn't about Democrats and Republicans, this is about cops and robbers."" If only the makers of this film could have been so concise at some point in the first reel or two of their documentary as to what it is they were trying to say. Instead, from the start, The Big Buy feels like a film you've walked into thirty minutes late. Following the theme stated by Earle of cops and robbers, The Big Buy is supposed to have a film noir aesthetic, but the intended use of light and shadow is so intermittent you likely won't notice. Somewhere in this mess is a good film and a better story, to bad it's not being told here."
5,Outstanding!,"At first, I didn't think that they'd be able to do it. I mean, come on. A role-playing game without dice?! But do it they did, and in spades! You have more control over Character creation, the new magic system allows for whatever spells your mind can come up with, and your fate is more in your hands with the cards, rather than the dice. Plus, you fight those Dragons! Well worth anyone's $20."
5,The name says it all!,"If you love country music than you'll without a doubt love George in this video. The name says it all ""Pure Country"" is what it is! Highly recommend this video for your collection."
3,Cute plot...great price!,I saw this one on TV...and thought it was a cute plot. For the money... I thought it was a good deal.
5,Pure Country,This is one of my favorite movies. It stars George Strait! He is from Texas and is a country singer in the movie.I liked the story and the characters. I felt the actors were well cast. Did I mention it stars George Strait?????
3,"Nothing profound, but a good movie.","The only competent actor in this movie is the multi-talented Leslie Ann Warren, who doesn't get to do a whole lot. Even so, it's a fun feel-good movie in which George Strait doesn't even try to do anything but be himself. Filled with great songs performed by Strait, this movie sometimes resembles a long music video. It's definitely worth a look, especially for fans of George Strait."
4,Great Movie,This is a movie that the whole family can watch. I am not a big fan of country music but I even liked the sound track.
3,Thanks,I was worried if it was coming or not. It took a while but after receiving it it was worth the wait.
3,movie,I didn't like the fact that the movie was from mexico and then had the subtitle on the bottom. wasn't not happy about it i order movies all the time from amazon and that has never happen I had ordered another movie and cannot watch it because it is prohibit when i put it in
5,Coffee Drinker Again!,I can drink coffee again without getting an upset stomach. I take 2 tablets just before I drink a 12 oz cup. No problema!
2,Not So Cool,"This gun looks and feels great - especially for a kid.The biggest problems? It's almost impossible to get the caps out after they have been shot. There is no release or push pin as you find with even the cheapest ring cap guns. You need to carry a knife or screwdriver to pry out the ring, and then hope the ring doesn't break, leaving small cap pieces in the drum that are even more difficult to pull out.Second... the caps aren't very loud, and only fire about half the time. Not sure if this is a problem with the caps or the firing mechanism on the gun. At any rate, VERY dissapointing for a kid to have only a few shots fire.. and then even more so when they can't get the caps out. That means Dad has to be on hand full time to be the 'assistant'. not so cool, especially when there are better guns for about $3 at the store."
3,BETTER FOR DISPLAY,This gun is better for displaying it may break easily but you can operate it and convert it to single action mode if you lose the spring.. The single action works withoutthe spring. the gun is made out of metal and plastic. The belt is not really in good quality it is better to use a leather belt.
5,Favorite gun to date,"My son loves it.This gun has taken a beating and still works. We haven't used it much for the cap firing, mainly just for pretend fun."
3,Replica,This item reminds me so much of how a breakfront 38 actually opens. Cylinder comes of and you place caps on it; then reinsert it and close breakfront. It is smaller than actual gun but can be held in an adults hand. There is an Orange plastic tip on the end of the barrel to let people know that it is a toy. Good easily be mistaken for real!
4,My son loves this gun,"I got this gun for my son for his special xmas gift. He loved the gun and used it a bunch the first day. The only complaint is that the hammer broke internally the first day. Now I don't know if he dropped it are if it broke on its on, but it still works as a single shot and he still plays with it. Its hard rating the durability as its a heavy, realistic looking gun thats way better than anything else you can find."
3,It got off to a good start,"It was healthy when I received it. I spent the rest of summer outside in a reasonably shady spot. It was not hardy to a Utah winter so it cam into the house and lived under the lights. Part way through the winter, it up and died. I don't know why. I kept it adequately watered. It was a pretty tree while it was alive."
4,Book was used but in great condition!,"Book took a while to get here, but when it finally arrived it was in great condition. No visible damage, looks almost brand new."
5,Girls Like It Too,My daughter and her girl friend love this book -- it's not a gender specific topic. I also think this book IS full of information -- just the right amount for a young child. It's really well done.
2,A shadow of his former self,"A major disappointment. Nobody who saw this great guitarist in his heyday would call this collection of badly sung blue standards a great album. I had heard that Johnny Winter's health has been failing for several years and that now, nearly blind, he needs to be led on and off the stage. Listening to Live in NYC reminds of concerts I have seen with some of the aging blues giants -- John Lee Hooker, B.B. King -- where they are well past their prime and just going through the motions. I would refer anybody who wants to hear what this amazing musician was once capable of to ""And Live"" or ""Captured Live"" or any of the Alligator Records from the 80's."
3,10 years old and still usefull,"I happened on a copy of this book recently and browsed it. As a fan of Life Extension Foundation, I knew that the concept was scientifically sound. You can still follow his recommendations today. There has been some progress since then, especially in the blood lab tests that are used today, but most internists and family physicians don't have a clue yet. Pain specialists might be just learning about fish oil and vitamin D. If you want to do something about your pain, he mentions that 9 out 10 people back then over 60 years were suffering from one joint or other. He is probably on the mark today as well. Why not think about what that one person who is not having pain might be doing right. I think I am close (age 61)but had to get cancer to change my life.This book is very readable but has some medical terms that you might have to look up."
1,another DON'T BOTHER love story,The story seems interesting in the first chapter but quickly turns to painfully contrived nonsense to fill up the pages between frightfully awkward sex. Why can't romance writers turn out a real plot with believable characters and situations?
1,Windshield haze or film,"This product leaves a film on your windshield that is only visible when it is raining and you are driving at night. Very diminished visibility. Each swipe of the wiper leaves a momentary haze or film, disappears for a milisecond, and then reappears with the next swipe. At first, I thought I needed new wiper blades and purchased them. However, I discovered it was not the blades but the Invisible Glass. I used this product last year and had the same problem. I will not use it again. I am extremely surprised at the praise for this product. Perhaps people are not using it on their windshields. It would be fine for house windows or side car windows. I highly recommend not applying this to your windshield. The film is not easily removed. The washer fluid in my car does not remove it. I am going to try Glass Plus."
4,"Works great, but fragile.","The specs say that this is a very good filter. I have used one in my travel trailer for quite a while and never had any issues with water purity. Sadly, this purchase is to replace the one that broke after very little use. The nipple at the bottom snapped off, where it plugs into the filter housing. They're pretty expensive to be that delicate. If the ceramic portion had been what broke, maybe I could understand, but this was the plastic part at the bottom! As for purchasing from Amazon, WOW what a slow delivery. I ordered it two weeks before an upcoming camping trip and had to take the trip without it, because it didn't arrive in time. Since I paid for standard shipping, I was HIGHLY disappointed with the slow delivery."
4,"Warm, funny and heartfelt.","This was a wonderful story about three generations of women and the men in (and out) of their lives. Told from each of their viewpoints, Gaffney especially captures what it is like to be a teenager, along with what it is to be like the mother of a teenager, and what it is like to be the matriarch , growing older and trying to hold her family all together. Recently widowed, Carrie struggles to get on with her life, raise her teen daughter Ruth, and come to terms with her pushy-at-times mother Dana and the relationship she has with her father George. Enter Carrie's highschool sweetheart and throw in her domineering new boss and some ark animals and you have a wonderfully entertaining story that will stay with you for a long time. A terrific novel for any generation."
1,Slow Book,This was not my type of book. It reads like a biography. Very slow with all the little details. Would not recommend.
3,Riveting!,"This whole series is great, full of eyewitness accounts, testimonials...sometimes disturbing testimonials of those who have experienced first-hand UFO & Alien activity. It is not always pleasant...but is always interesting. You can really see the trauma some of these people have gone through. It also will make you a bit paranoid, what with all the cover-ups and hush surrounding UFO facts."
1,SLOOOOOOOOOW songs and HIP-HOP songs!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"What the heck??? I voted for Ruben and he makes an album of slow songs and hip-hop stuff! This album makes no sense, Stick with something, my goodness! TERRIBLE CD!!! I do not recommend at all! D-"
4,GO REUBEN........NOTHIN TO BE SORRY FOR,REUBEN'S CD AFTER I LISTENED TO IT MORE THAN ONCE THE HIP HOP TUNES CAUGHT ON AND I LOVE THE TUNE NO MORE REUBEN ... GREAT DANCE TUNE.. HAD GOTTEN USED TO HIS BARRY WHITE / LUTHER VANDROSS STYLE ON IDOL BUT THIS CD SHOWED OFF HIS ABILITY TO SING DIFFERENT STYLES OF MUSIC... THE EXECS COULD HAVE DID A BETTER JOB ON THE COVER OF REUBEN'S ALBUM...OFF TO A GOOD START...GO REUBEN ...OH GO OUT AND BUY THE CD AND SUPPORT REUBEN'S MUSIC AND DON'T BUY THOSE BOOTLEG COPIES OFF THE STREET!!!
5,Ruben Studdard Has Delivered The Goods,"This CD from Track #1 Soulful 2004 to Track #14 We Have Not Forgotten shows why Ruben is the American Idol. He has made his own statement, and what a fine statement it is. This CD should appeal to old and young, and if it doesn't then you have a hole in your Soul.And my kudos to Clive Davis.........I was praying that he didn't drop the ball with Ruben.........and as usual this CD cements my thoughts on Mr. Davis, he is a Star Maker and Industry Shaker but then having Ruben Studdard on your label supplies not doubt that you two should have a great collaboration."
3,The album gets old really fast.,"Most songs on this album aren't timeless. Within weeks, you will get sick of this album. Ruben should've came better than this. There are a few tracks that stand out, they are ""What If,"" ""How Can U Mend A Broken Heart,"" ""After The Candles Burn"" and ""Superstar."" The rest are boring album fillers, or just are so terrible, that you can't listen to the whole song. ""No Ruben"" and ""What Is Sexy"" are examples of two terrible songs. Hopefully on his sophomore album, he will bring the heat like a true American Idol."
1,"""Sorry"" but ""No Ruben"" for me","Even with all big names pushed with this debut cd, along some cover songs, I was sadly disappointed. I found myself changing tracks before each song was over. Superstar, omg, how long can that song be?? No Ruben is a chessy wannabe rap song. Sorry 2004, the lyrics/ Pulease! Maybe he should have taken a few more months to work on this album."
3,Not What Was Expected,I feel that this album is okay. I was expecting a better debut than this. A couple of tracks keep me grooving but the overall album is a disappointment. I was hoping that the album would lean more toward a soulful(hense the title) groove. The problem with American Idol is that they find talent but they turn them into these pop clones. I don't fault Ruben though(he is under contract).
1,Is capable of so much more,"This CD was a huge disappointment to me, I think Ruben is capable of so much more. Did not like the style of what he sings. Would not recommend!"
1,Horrible....Thought it would be better!,"This cd was a waste of my $10.00. All Ruben is is a hip-hop wanna be. This sounds like everything else being made today by hip-hop artists. Plain out...JUST DON'T GET IT!The only good song is ""Flying Without Wings"" but thats a cover anyways. A boyband called ""Westlife"" were the original artists who sang it. Listen to the original song. It's better than Ruben's.Get Clay's CD. It's well worth it."
1,This CD should Hip Hop out of my CD player,Oh noooooooo! This is a typical hip-hop/rap CD. Not for the American Idol fan. I'm soooooo disapointed. I listened to it once and that is probably my last time. I wish I could return it. Reuben fooled us on American Idol. He is a hip-hop wanna be. I wish his record label would have kept him on track as a pop star.Sorry Reuben. I can't say anything nice. (I voted for you and wish I hadn't now)
1,GRASPING AT STRAWS,"Sad, so sad. I read these comments, and see very little in the way of record reviews. I came here to read them to see if the record was worth buying. All I see is a group of people who are using incorrect statistics and grasping at the only thing they have to be proud of - the title of American Idol.Why can't you Rueben fanatics let anyone else be successful too? I won't buy this album if these messages are any kind of indication of what fan base I would be associated with. If you all have this much time on your hands, volunteer and do some good. Get off Mr. Aiken's back. Would you like some cheese with that whine?"
1,BIG DISAPOINTMENT,"I just got Rubens cd, my goodness, TERRIBLE! I really liked Ruben on American Idol and voted for him MANY times!!! I do not like the album at all! Most of the songs are slow and drag out terrribly, then you get What Is Sexy! My goodness, what the heck? HIP-HOP Rap crap mixed with slow songs, makes NO SENSE at all, TERRIBLE I DO NOT recommend this at all!! TERRIBLE CD!"
2,RUBEN HAS LET US DOWN!!!,"RUBEN HAS LET US DOWN!! BAD SELECTION OF SONGS. THIS IS THE LAST CD I'll BUY OF RUBENS. ITS INTERESTING TO READ THE REVIEWS HERE..IF YOU DON'T LIKE THIS CD YOUR A RUBEN HATER,A CLAY FAN,JEALOUS BECAUSE RUBEN WON,DIDN'T BUY THIS CD(THEY SAY) ,DON'T LIKE IT BECAUSE RUBENS FAT, BECAUSE HE'S BLACK OR WE WANT TO HURT RUBENS SALES. OR IF HIS CD ISN'T SELLING GOOD ITS BECAUSE AMER.IDOL IS GIVING CLAY MORE PUBLICITY OR ITS BECAUSE CLAY PUT HIS ALBUM FIRST AND HOW DARE ROLLING STONE PUT CLAY AIKENS PICTURE ON THEIR COVER BEFORE RUBENS? WELL FOLKS ITS NONE OF THOSE REASONS......ITS BECAUSE HIS ALBUM ISN'T VERY GOOD.ITS THAT SIMPLE! WE ALL EXPECTED MORE OF WHAT WE HEARD ON AMER.IDOL.WE THOUGHT RUBEN HAD A GREAT VOICE.. THAT IS WHY WE VOTED FOR HIM.I FEEL THE SAME AS OTHERS THAT RUBEN LET US DOWN. I WAS A FAN OF RUBENS BUT NO LONGER AND THATS HIS FAULT."
1,I expected better,"After the cd release date was pushed back several times, I thought it was because Ruben was working really hard on making it the best he could. Soulful?, sorry its more like SLOWful."
1,Where did my Velvet Teddy Bear go??,"I loved you on AI! Where did that soulful voice disappear too?? I like a few of the songs, but the rest have got to go! I still love you Ruben! I am happy for the success of Ruben & Clay! Next time Ruben, bring the church down!"
3,SOULFUL 2004,I THINK RUBEN HAS DONE A WONDERFUL JOB ON THIS CD. I ALSO FEEL LIKE EVEVYONE SHOULD AKNOWLEDGE THAT HE IS THE AMERICAN IDOL AND NOT CLAY STOP COMPARING THEM AND THEIR MUSIC TOHETHER BECAUSE THEY ARE TWO VERY DIFFERENT INDIVIDUALS. I LOVE CLAY ALSO AND HOPE THAT HIS CAREER TAKES HIMS PLACES BUT C'MON GIVE RUBEN HIS PROPS AND LET HIM SHINE AS THE AMERICAB IDOL THAT HE TRULY IS. GO OUT BUY THE CD LISTEN AND ENJOY...
2,"Better than Clay, but less than decent","Anytime you have DMX producer Swizz Beatz on your R&B; LP more than once, there's going to be problems...Out of 14 tracks, 4 were great, 3 were ok, and the others were fluff (see ""What is Sexy"" and ""No Ruben""). Despite my opinion that some of the lyrical content on the lot of these tracks were as if they were penned by a 14 year old, standouts like ""After the Candles Burn"" (HOTNESS BTW), the club friendly ""Dont Quit On Me"", ""We Have Not Forgotten"" and ""Superstar"" (though a subpar remake) was worth the purchase.In the future, I think that Rube should work with the likes of Organized Noize (TLC,Outkast), A Touch of Jazz (Jill Scott), Jaydee (ATCQ, Roots, Badu, Common), and James Poyser (Badu) for an album thats truthfully SOULFUL."
2,What??!??,"This album stinks.Ruben was awesome under pressure on American Idol. He had an edge and urgency and feel.This album fails on many fronts, mostly by not capturing what is really inside that big man. I think that without the 'need to succeed', Ruben was led astray into this cluttered mess. The only song worth a second listen is 'How Do You Mend A Broken Heart'. He pulls that one up by the bootstraps.I hope that he stops listening to his handlers and moves BACK to center stage on his next album and belts out some of the soul that he showed us last year. Otherwise we'll all be saying, 'Ruben who?'"
2,THESE ARE REVIWS?????,"I CAME HERE TO READ THE REVIEWS OF RUBENS CD...INSTEAD....I FIND INSULTS OF ALL KINDS BEING HURLED AT ONE ANOTHER......AND BY THE WAY .... WHAT HAS CLAY AIKEN GOT TO DO WITH THIS CD? HE IS NOT SINGING ON THIS ALBUM. MY GOODNESS!!! I'VE READ A NUMBER OF THESE REVIEWS AND CAN'T BELIEVE HOW MANY TIMES CLAY AIKEN HAS BEEN HARSHLY ATTACKED BY MANY OF YOU.HE DIDN'T DO ANYTHING TO ANY OF YOU.I UNDERSTAND THESE YOUNG MEN ARE FRIENDS...PLEASE RESPECT THEIR FRIENDSHIP. NOW TO MY REVIEW. I THINK THAT THE CHOICE OF SONGS ON THIS CD DO NOT SHOWCASE THE BEAUTIFUL VOICE THAT RUBEN HAS.HE HAS PROVEN THAT HE HAS THE TALENT,I HOPE THAT HE MIGHT MOVE IN THE DIRECTION OF LUTHER AND YET STILL BRING HIS OWN STYLE INTO HIS MUSIC. I HAVE NOT GIVEN UP ON RUBEN...I BELIEVE HE CAN DO MUCH BETTER THAN THIS."
2,Popstar?,"I thought the whole idea of American Idol was to find a Popstar? I feel like the people that voted for Ruben like myself were misled. I bought this CD thinking it was the Ruben from American Idol but it's not. If you like R&B then you might like this album, if you are expecting Ruben from the show you will be disappointed. Listen before you buy this one."
1,!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! YAWN !!!!!!!!!!!!!,"My mom always told me that if you have nothing good to say, don't say anything at all. Here's my review ........................... Guess that sums it up. Don't waste your money. The cd is garbage."
3,Okay,"The Cd was simply OK. There was absolutely no effort made on this Cd. I am disappointed that the writers, producers did not concentrate on more of a Luther sound. Rueben has All that it takes to be GREAT..So lets do it....... Next Cd lets touch the Females heart, soul and Inner being.....Show us how to love, how to stay in love."
1,just plain ick,"That is all I can say about this. Ruben can do Luther, but that is about it. Save your money."
3,Not what I expected,"Since Ruben is the so-called velvet teddy bear, why would he include RAP on his LONG LONG awaited CD??? He was NOT rapping on American Idol, so why would his dedicated fans expect him to rap? Whoever made these decisions should be dismissed as soon as possible. There are only a few songs on SOULFUL that I enjoy, there are many more that I do not enjoy. What is SEXY is one of them. No Ruben* I could go on and on. I expected love songs, not rapping hip hop* As a dedicated Ruben Fan I am disappointed. The album cover is not even any good, Ruben needs new representation. The only way to stop the madness is for only the love ballads be released to the radio stations, otherwise, I fear that Ruben will be a has-been sooner rather than later."
1,I TRIED TO LIKE IT !,"I listened to Rubens CD several times and it was just awful... I hate to say that... I love Clay Aikens voice and Clay loves Ruben so even for that reason alone I wanted to like it... but it was freakin impossible!...it was that lame...the lyrics are stupid... ""the idol with the title""...""a house with no roof and no doors""....he seems to want to make mention of AI in the CD which I think was a big mistake... and he comes off sounding very haughty in several of the tracks...talkin bout girls screamin his name everywhere he goes now... well they scream Clays name even more and throw underwear at him, but you don't hear him gettin all puffed up about it and singin about it do you?....I think singles from this CD will totally bomb on the charts and I doubt that any video from it will ever hit number 1 on MTV."
3,Nothing to write home about,"I purchased this CD expecting to hear the ""Velvet Teddy Bear"" voice that he had on American Idol. I am not hearing that voice at all. The songs are okay, but not great. This is a good attempt at a first release, I hope future ones are better."
2,NOT A GOOD START!!!,ALL THIS TALK ABOUT A NOMINATION. RUBEN NEEDS A LOT OF LUCK IF HE THINKS HE CAN GET A GRAMMY. THIS ALBUM IS NOT ANYTHING THAT I WOULD HAVE EXPECTED FROM RUBEN. HE HAS A GREAT VOICE AND FOR SOME REASON HE LET DOWN A LOT OF HIS FAN.I THOUGHT HE WAS GOOD ON IDOL AND EXPECTED GREAT THINGS FROM HIM.HIS VOICE IS AWESOME AND HE COULD BE DOING SONGS THAT SHOWCASE IT. I HAVE NO PROBLEM WITH BLUES OR HIP HOP BUT IT ISN'T FOR RUBEN. I DON'T LIKE THIS CD BUT YOU CAN BUY IT AND JUDGE FOR YOURSELF.
1,DREADFUL,"Shockingly poor effort to promote the latest American Idol winner. I agree with the recent reviewer who said this is NOT the Ruben America came to love.The music on some tracks isn't bad, but the lyrics on the original songs are mostly stupid....simply atrocious at times. Little, if any, warmth by Ruben. Velvet teddy bear? Nope. Not even close.Shame shame on the producers."
2,Hmmm....,"I watched American Idol and I voted for Ruben a few times. I really love his rich, pleasant voice. But I have to admit that I'm disappointed in this cd. My daughter bought it for me for Christmas because I requested it. Maybe I expected to hear the same Ruben that I heard in the show, but I was very disappointed in the song selections for this cd, except for the Bee Gees song and For All We Know. I like Superstar also. I guess I'm not much of a rap fan, although the rap in the cd is rap-lite. Even his voice seems a little worn and fatigued, I'm disappointed. Better luck, next time, Ruben."
2,What Happened?,The songs didn't show-case his voice enough. I agree with other reviews that he has a very limited range with his vocals. Clay's debut was definitely more powerful.
5,RUBEN IS THE BOMB!!!!,THIS ALBUM IS TRUELY ONE OF THE BEST THIS YEAR AND THERE IS ALOT TO CHOOSE FROM. FROM START TO FINISH THIS CD IS GOOD. A VERY GOOD MIX OF R&B WITH A LITTLE HIP HOP. VERY TASTEFUL CD. IT DOES NOT COME OUT OF MY CD PLAYER. PLEASE SUPPORT HIM AND BUY THIS CD. AND DON'T PAY ANY ATTENTION TO THE HATERS. FROM THE PROMATION WE ALL KNOW RUBEN IS GETTING DISSED AND ALL THE ATTENTION TO CLAY WHICH IS NOT RIGHT. IT JUST PROVES THAT THIS WORLD IS VERY RACIST. WHY DOES CLAY GET ALL THE ATTENTION ON EVERY TV SHOW AND WIN ALL THE AWARDS. HIS ALBUM SHOULD NOT HAVE CAME OUT BEFORE RUBENS ANYWAY. BUT WE ALL KNOW HOW THAT WENT N-E WAY PLEASE GO GET THE WONDERFUL ALBUM YOU WILL NOT BE DISSAPOINTED.
1,OMG.....Absolutely Terrible!!!!!,"How in the world did Ruben Studdard win over Clay Aiken????? It absolutely boggles the mind....Are people tone deaf??? And this sells??? HUH??? Why, because he won the AI Title??? What a load of crap.....Please, please, please people...Wake up!!! Listen to the demos of this cd before you buy it...You will be glad you did, and you will save your money!!! I'm glad I did, because I would have brought it back to the store for a refund in a heartbeat.....Just goes to show you that Paula, Randy and especially Simon did not know what they were talking about when they kept boosting Ruben up, and putting Clay down...I hope they are all eating crow right now.....And it just goes to show you they didn't know talent when it was right in front of their faces!!! They blew it big time.....By choosing Ruben and not Clay!!!!Too bad Canada wasn't allowed to vote...Clay would've blew Ruben right out of the water in a major landslide!!!!!!Enough said!!!!!"
5,It's SOUL people!,"Ruben sings soul in modern day's truest sense. Those who don't like it are those who are looking for a pop idol or something similar to what was on American Idol. His roots are in the south and he is a soulful, soulful singer. If you don't like modern soul or R&B, then buy Clay Aikens' music. Ruben is only being true to his roots.This is probably one of the best CDs produced in a very long time!"
2,Sorry 2003...,"...should be the name. Though I am a big fan of American Idol, as well as Ruben AND Clay, I have to say that this CD was a disappointment. I was one of those fans who expected something truly great from Ruben, something closer to his perfomances on the show.I didn't get it. I'm sure he wanted to spend more time on it so he could one-up Clay, but it doesn't work. Clay's CD, though monotonous in songs, was worth listening to just to listen to the powerful sounds of his voice. However, Ruben sounds bland and tired-out, and most of the songs are no special treat.This is no way a ""Ruben"" review, so you don't need to call me a ""hater"" or ""claymate"", because this was a ""music"" review. In all honesty, Ruben's CD does not measure up, and the only thing more I can say that I hope his next CD will be better. But if you must purchase an AI CD, I strongly recommend that you buy Clay's this time, not because he is better, but simply because his CD is better."
1,PATHETIC ALBUM !!!!,"I gave the money to the cashier and its like she handed me a piece of crap !!!! I only bought this CD for my IDOL collection !!! I haven't listened to it since I bought it last year !!! This cd is just horrible !!! Ruben doesn't need to be singing songs like "" WHAT IS SEXY "" anyways...thats just comical!!! HE IS THE WORST IDOL YET...AND I CAN'T BELIEVE I'M SAYING THAT BECAUSE THEN WE HAVE...FANTASIA? AN IDOL!!! They are both so horrible !!! Ruben Studdard is so bad...and that is the reason he is fallen into the category of "" hasbeen ""...maybe he can be on VH1's "" Surreal Life "". Ha Ha!!!"
3,Love the Soul,Ruben has got a great soulful voice. His R&B songs are good but unfortunately I do not like the hip hop and the rap tracks. Versitily is good but the genres in this album is too wide and it is just my opinion that they didn't do very well together on this album.
1,"Anything but ""Soulful""","I thought he sounded great on AI. What happened here???His voice sounds computerized on this CD and most of the lyrics are god-awful. Here's an example: Girl this is my sorry for 2004 and I ain't gonna mess up no more, i'm sorry, i'm sorry, etc.Pick it up used if you must, but it isn't worth the full-price."
1,AWFUL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I cannot believe they shipped this out as the final product! Ruben is out of breath on half of the songs? Sorry, I voted for him and definatly sorry I paid money for this worthless album!"
3,Could be better.,"I was not impressed with Ruben's debut. No new ground was broken and many of the beats sounded unpolished. There are some good ones to be had, mainly ""Sorry 2004"",""What If"" and ""Superstar"", all of which offer a glimpse into what Ruben can do if given the right material. The more upbeat cuts come off sounding too pop. The guest appearances by Pretty Tony and Fat Joe are ill timed and don't add anything to the albums's overall quality. Ruben has talent but this album is not really worth buying."
2,AGREE WITH REVIEWS OR ??????,"I'M A SENIOR AND I FIND IT INTERESTING THAT WHEN YOU WRITE REVIEWS YOU GET HARSH PERSONAL ATTACKS. IF YOU DON'T LIKE THIS CD YOU ARE CALLED A RUBEN HATER,DON'T LIKE IT BECAUSE RUBEN WON AND HE IS BLACK OR YOU ARE A CLAY MATE AND YOU ARE GIVING THIS CD 1 STAR SO RUBEN WON'T SELL MANY CDS AND....IF YOU DON'T LIKE THIS CD YOU SHOULD STAY OFF THIS SITE BECAUSE ITS RUBENS. IS THAT REALY WHAT THIS REVIEW SITE IS FOR? I MAY BE OLD...... BUT OLD DON'T MAKE ME STUPID.COME ON PEOPLE. IS THIS WHAT RUBEN WOULD WANT? THIS IS NOT A GOOD CD. I AGREE WITH THE PERSON FROM FOLEY AL.BAD ADVICE.RUBEN HAS A BEAUTIFUL VOICE.I THINK HE DESERVES BETTER AND I HOPE THAT HE GETS ANOTHER CHANCE TO PROVE HIS WORTH.HE NEEDS TO TALK TO RANDY JACKSON TO GET FRESH IDEAS AND BOOT THE ONES WHO WON'T LISTEN."
1,Recycle it,Ruben can sing but not on this CD. I've listened to it once and that will be the one and only time. I'd give it no stars; he can do so much better. Ruben should stick with the Luther Vandross/Barry White type of songs that really showcase his voice.
5,Crazy Sick Rub,"Ok 1st of all i couldnt wait until i heard the album so i could see if everything all of you had to say was accurate and after hearing it its become obvious to me that either all of you ""ballad huggers"" need a hobby or you need to expand your horizons. This man showed that he has the ability to throw a little sumthin in for everyone. How many artists can pull off that many different elements of music on one album. In my opinion this album grabs you and takes you on a ride. Not to say that everyone has the same taste in music but obviously you all liked Ruben because you bought the album so get over the album of ballads expectations that you all have and enjoy the album for what it is and what it has to offer."
1,Soul-Less,"All I can say is that this was a true dissapointment!!! There are a lot of long wavering runs in his songs (that are often flat by the way) and no real true show of power, soul and talent. ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ!!!!! What a shame!!!!!!"
1,Sorry 2004,"Ruben, why didn't you appoligize in advance for this terrible album in 2003? I did not buy the cd, I borrowed it from a friend. But I can honestly say that I was surprised with the way this cd sounds. His voice sounds nothing like he does live. It is completely altered to make him sound like he as some marginal amount of talent.While Ruben's voice sounds a lot better on his cd than it did on the show, it still is far from good. He sounds like every other mediocre R&B singer out there. I do like some R&B, as long as the songs sound original, and the voices are pure and pleasant to listen to.My suggestion: Don't waste your money on this. If you are that curious and not a hardcore fan, ask someone to lend you the cd."
2,"Did buy the CD to support you, but...","I'm disappointed Rube !! You are a balladeer, not a hip-hop star. Your voice was strained and rushed through all the hip-hop sounding stuff, and not as strong on the ballads. Stick to what got you to this point; smooth ballads that showcase your voice instead of the crap that makes you sound like you're gasping for breath. Love ya Rube !!!"
2,OUCH!!!,"I REALLY LKED RUBEN ON IDOL...ME AND THE WIFE VOTED FOR HIM.THIS IS NOT A GOOD WAY TO USE SUCH A GREAT GIFTED SINGER. RUBEN,YOUR VOICE IS SO SMOOTH SO COOL.USE IT AS IT WAS MEANT TO BE USED.YOU MUST REMEMBER WHY AMER. PUT YOU TO #1. THAT GREAT VOICE!!!!! I DON'T LIKE THIS CD...BUT I LOVE RUBEN.REMEMBER WHEN HE SANG ""A WHOLE NEW WORLD""? I GOT CHILLS. THAT IS THE RUBEN WE FELL IN LOVE WITH.THAT IS THE KIND OF MUSIC THAT SHOWCASES RUBENS BEAUTIFUL VOICE...LOVE YOU MAN"
1,Music Fan from Chicago,"I enjoyed Ruben's voice on American Idol on occasion (until what he was singing started to sound the same from week to week.) I gave a thorough listen of Soulful twice and came to the same conclusion both times - very boring and very bad hip-hop. Ruben wanted to spend more time on this CD to put out a quality product. Why so many covers? Why so many collaborations? No Ruben was nothing but boring and self-promoting. I don't think Ruben has the right vocals for How Can You Mend A Broken Heart - just did not do the song the justice it deserves. The majority of the CD had the same old boring beats you already hear in the music world. Very disappointed in the choice made for this CD and based on what I listened, I will not buy."
2,Velvet Tiddleywinks,"Ruben seems like a SUPERNICE guy with IMMENSE talent. But after listening to these tracks, I think somebody dropped the ball for him. I think his voice wasn't showcased in most of these songs. ""For All We Know"" is really good. And I like ""What If."" But for the most part, Ruben seems to be trying SO hard that he sounds kinda ""flat."" I don't see too many hits coming from this album unless there are a score of remixes being worked on. I am very disappointed. I waited for this album so long... I thought it would be exceptional. Better luck next album, Roob."
3,Nice Debut from a up & coming Ballader,"Watching season 2 of Amercian Idol I became a big fan of Ruben Studdard. He delvers on his promise on Soulful which is just a classy R&B CD. Ruben grabbed my attention when he hit us with Sorry 2004 his lush Bartione reminds of me James Ingram and as with the rest of the ballads How Can You Mend A Broken Heart,Superstar and After The Candles Burn Ruben shows he knows how to SANG about soulful love. The uptempo tracks is where Ruben messes up, like Luther and Johnny Gill before him Ruben needs to stick to slow songs. I think next time he should hook up with Babyface, Jimmy Jam & Terry Lewis to help him show Amercia the promise he has."
4,Ruben and Clay are both excellent artists,"I agree with some other reviewers by saying that the styles of Ruben and Clay are entirely different. I will admit that I am more of a fan of Clays voice and style then I am of Ruben's, but I can appreciate Ruben's smooth voice. So, I just wanted to come here on Ruben's CD site and give some support to Ruben and his fans. Just as Clay and Ruben are friends, there are many Clay fans out there that can appreciate the talent of Clay AND Ruben."
1,Rolling Stone Got It Right!!!,"Thank you Rolling Stone for giving Ruben's CD the 1 star rating that it truly deserves!!!...As a product, this CD sucks 100%...Anyone that thinks otherwise is just kidding themselves...Ruben fan or not (I WAS a fan)...just admit that you threw your money away on this dreadful waste of recording studio time!!!"
1,UNIMPRESSIVE!!!!!,Very disappointed in Rubens Album and I am sad to say I voted for him! AWFUL ALBUM!
2,It's not Clay vs. Ruben,"I found this cd ""okay."" If it hadn't been Ruben, I would have placed it in the range of the average cds I can walk past without purchasing. Is he just a little flat sometimes?Not a big fan of the Idol show, I purchased both Ruben's cd and Clay Aiken's on a whim. I must say that I can't understand how the former got a grammy nod while the latter did not. Aiken seems to have something new and special. That voice.... Haven't heard one like that for a long time. His cds will continue to go in my cart."
1,What were you thinking?,What were you thinking? I was so hoping you would kick some ass on this great chance you were given. Who advised you to sing these songs? FIRE THEM!
1,Bad DVD,The DVD was bad. It played only half disk then stopped. I tried too many times but it still the same. I already sent email to the seller to exchange a new DVD but no respond yet in two weeks.Thanks anyway
1,I agree with the previous reviews...,"This text was required reading for my anthropology course and although I was looking forward to learning about the subject matter, I felt that Haviland wrote in a way that made it much less enjoyable than it should have been. Often repetitive, always with his own biased version and even his terminology (using such phrases as *something like* when using descriptives)were not what I expected from someone of his caliber. To make matters worse, the *Original Study* segments which were some of the most interesting parts of the book were printed on a green background with the print lightened so that it was barely readable...what were the publishers thinking? I was greatly disappointed."
2,"So much writing, so little information","I have been wanting to read a biography of Lord Nelson for some time now - mostly due to my reading of the entire ""Master and Commander"" series. It may be that I wished too much for Patrick O'Brian's passion when detailing the life of a real person but this entire biography felt like nothing more than a series of quotes being strung together. And, too often, the quotes were so out of context it was hard to even understand them. Besides that, often the quotes completely contradicted each other. I never got any real sense of the man or what it was like to live his life. If anything, it was like a time line with occasional context. There must be a better read out there about this fascinating man."
4,Cop to Call Girl,"Norma Jean is an original, covering the days she was a metermaid in Los Angeles up to her peak days as a Beverly Hills call girl (when she met yours truly and subsequently appeared on the same talk shows with me). Besides doing the media circuit, Norma Jean is now living in Montana with her (former actor) husband and spends much of her time as a human rights activist with the worldwide internet pro movements."
4,Love,"I've only listened to Edge To Life, Curse and Bloodline. They're three of the greatest songs I've heard lately. They all have their own message and life philosphy, ""There's an edge to life that will cut you like a knife when you lay your down... I miss you."" Curse is about people who can't believe religion ""you're blind to the facts"" Bloodline has this scary thing at the end with a woman wailing. I haven't really listen to the rest of the album, because I don't like instrumentals (Freeze). It gets a four because it has three of my favorite songs on it."
2,"Cute idea, but it doesn't work...","This is a cute concept. My 3 1/2 y.o. daughter has wanted the Bratz doll styling head, but she is still a little young for that look (grin), so I thought this would be a good compromise. It is a cute idea, in that you don't have to use real make-up, and she can still do a makeover. Well, even after putting ice in the carriage cup, the water still wasn't cold enough to elicit a color change on the doll's face. We tried everything, but the makeup didn't change colors. The hair falls out easily when brushing it, and the barrettes are difficult for a little girl to fasten alone. She ended up being very disappointed in this toy, and it sits up in the closet unused. Perhaps I will let her buy some cheap makeup and give the doll a real makeover, but then, that sort of defeats the purpose of this toy. Overall, I consider it a big waste of money..."
4,Enjoyable,"Dave is a truly enjoyable movie starring a very strong cast. Kevin Kline is very good in this movie, as is Sigourney Weaver. Great line from this movie ... ""We're walking. We're walking. We're walking AND we're stopping."" Guess you have to see it to appreciate it."
4,"Where Williams, Goldsmith and Horner fear to tread.","It seems that the genre of gentle romantic comedy is one that inspires a stange trepidation in the hearts of the great and good of film composition. It's nice then, to see other lesser mortals such as Mr Newton Howard making such a fantastic job of it.If you like warm waves of 'feel good' to emanate from your speakers then this score is ideal. OK, so it's a little on the short side but even if you play it twice per sitting you'll still get more originality from it than most other longer CD's. This is definitely a genre standard and a must for any complete soundtrack collection.By the way,(just for the Brits out there) this is where the theme from the current Barclaycard advert originates. It doesn't feature prominantly but you can clearly hear it in the Main titles."
4,Good movie with a challenge to our politicians,"This is a good movie with a story about an ordinary guy doing extraordinary things!Dave (Kevin Kline) confesses that he's not very good at finding work for people (his ordinary job), but he has what most politicians lack - connection with ordinary struggling people and a deep sense of compassion.So when he gets the chance to be President for a short while, he makes a real impact.The movie also has a pointed message about the integrity we have a right to expect from our leaders."
5,Updated review,"I had written a review long ago, and wanted to update this. I've kept my ""Dave"" CD handy thru the past few months, and always enjoy listening to it time and again. ""Into the Fog"" while a melancholy piece, always lifts my spirits, and reminds me of one special lady in Florida :)"
4,If the President were only this nice,"Dave is one of those rare films that connects comedy with fairy tale. After what the nation has been through with the Clinton scandals and the contraversy of the 2000 election, this film has a gentility that is too be admired.The performance of Kevin Kline is worth the price of the DVD. He continues to be one of our finest actors. Actually, he is a great reactor. Pay special attention to the scene when he examines himself as both Dave and the President. The chemistry between Kline and Signourney Weaver is also capitivating. I suggest you rent The Ice Storm to really appreciate their collaboration in Dave.Finally, pay close attention to Charles Grodin. He steals the scenes in which he appears without saying a word."
5,This is THE definitive reference book on knitting.,"Having owned the previous edition to the same book, I went ahead and spent the extra money and gifted my old copy of this exquisite book to a friend. Why? It's so elegant and modern, I just couldn't resist. As always the information is so comprehensive and easy to understand, and this book is among the must-haves for any knitter, especially those from beginning and intermediate levels.As well, if you are looking for a book for a friend of yours that knits, and are unsure as to what to buy for them, unless they have this book already, it is one that even master teachers both own and prefer their students buy. Videotapes that show actual knitting in action cannot compare to the descriptions and diagrams in this book. No matter what style of knitting you are able to do, the book covers it. Pick, toss, it's all inside, and so beautiful."
3,Great book,I purchased the Vogue Ultimate Book of Knitting for a class fall 1999. It's a fabulous book. This books is a must have for knitters.
1,Can I give this zero stars?,Awful. Looks like it was made for an Atari. Mystery Case Files and Hidden Expedition games are much better.
2,Very dissatisified,"I purchased this brand of puppy pads based on the great reviews and couldn't wait for them to arrive. I had several ""cheap"" pads left from a Wal-Mart purchase, so I put them aside and carefully arraigned a couple of ""Little Stinker"" pads where my two Yorkies would use them. Even though my babies only weigh 4 pounds each, their urine has managed to soak through every ""Little Stinker"" pad I've used. I expected the pads to absorb the normal amount of urine a puppy would produce during an average day. These do not. Please keep in mind that my puppies eat and drink a very small amount of food and water compared to other breeds. With this in mind, I would definitely NOT recommend this product. I am so glad that I still have several cheap-O Wal-Mart pads left!"
2,Good book bad edition,"After reading this book, I complained to Amazon about numerous typos in the Kindle edition. They have agreed to pull the book and offer an improved edition."
2,Cruising the British Virgin Islands,"While it contains ""some"" useful information, the overall quality of this product, both from an information and video quality persepctive is poor. The video looks like something that was transfered from someone's home movies and reminds me of the old super 8 home movies I saw when I was a child. The intent of the product has some significant potential but it is lost in the overall quality of the presentation."
1,"Funnier than ""Shaolin Do: Secrets from the Temple""!!!","Folks, if you howled with laughter at Sin The's other tome, you'll split your sides with this one! The author claims to be grandmaster of a Chinese martial art which uses Japanese nomenclature that he obviously doesn't even understand. My favorite part is the definition of ""epong kumite,"" an obvious misinterpretation of the Japanese phrase, ""ippon kumite,"" which roughly translates to ""one punch sparring."" In Mr. The's universe, his new word, ""epong,"" becomes ""a type of punch used in karate."" Give me a break."
2,"Richard loses Kahlen, yet again...","O.k., enough with the I love my wife but I keep losing her bit. This was the worst book of Goodkind that I ever read, was a chore to read and only the last 100 pages started to get good. Then ending was disappointing and I felt like I wasted my time reading so much about Richard trying to prove his wife, did I mention whom he lost again, still exists. The missing wife tack is getting old. Why don't you let their love flourish and they fight together against the bad guys for a change. If you are thinking of purchasing this book--don't. It's the perfect one to check out of a library much as some movies are only worth the price of the DVD video rental. I love his other books but this one sadly was not the quality read I have grown accustomed to seeing by this author."
1,I came back to the series for THIS?!,"I gave up on this series two books ago - it had just become too grueling.... I decided to let Mr. Goodkind have 1 more shot with Chainfire. Boy, was I wrong. Preachy & boring to say the least. I don't read fantasy books so I can get lectured."
2,Where's the other half?,"I have been an avid SoT series fan but this one left me angry. I would suggest that if you are considering buying this book, wait until chainfire 2 comes out so you can read a complete work. This books drops the reader (after 500+ pages) in the middle of the story. Reminds me of the old part 1/part 2 batman episodes. Perhaps it is time for Goodkind to end the series and move on to another work? I agree with many of the previous comments. I enjoyed the philosophy up to the point that I had to start skipping pages because the repetition became burdensome. This occurred after the Temple of the Winds. Hey Goodkind...Are you really going to make us wait for the rest of Chainfire????? UGH!!!"
2,Longest Argument,"I only gave this book 2 stars because I found myself not able to put it down. The problem is that I couldn't put it down not bcse it was so great but bcse I wanted to find out what was going to happen next and it took forever to get there. I love the earlier Goodkind books but have been very disappointed in the last two (this one included). When I finished, I felt like I just read 600 plus pages of Richard trying to win an argument. I should have known the book was going to go nowhere when he started off one chapter describing how someone is approaching. The chapter ends and you still don't know who is approaching. Almost 700 pages and he still didn't finish the story.Very disappointing."
3,First half WHAT?!?!?! Second half decent,"Let me help you understand the first half of Chainfire...it goes something like this: ""Where's Kahlan?"" ""Who?"" ""My wife."" ""You don't have a wife"" ""Yes I do; where is she?"" ""You're not married!"" ""Where's Kahlan?"" etc...For the entire first half of the book the characters are running around the woods having that conversation over and over. It is VERY boring.Then comes the second half, Richard decides to visit Shota and when she begins to explain things the story picks up and we're off on a great adventure.We need to remember that this is the first of a trilogy and this is only used to set up the story.So after reading this review, you can skip ahead to when Richard meets with Shota and you won't miss much!"
2,"It should be an adventure series, not a lecture series!","I have been a loyal reader of Mr. Goodkind's Sword of Truth series since its inception. The first 5 books were wonderful. Since that time, however, Mr. Goodkind has provided less adventure and more lecture in his stories. This book is truly NOT WORTH READING if you are a fan of this series. This book is focused more on trite philosophical diatribes than progressing the story or developing the characters. Even if you are devoted fan of this series, don't feel guilty if you skip this book."
4,Chainfire,"This latest installment in The Sword of Truth series finds Richard Rahl insisting upon the existance of his wife, Kahlan. The problem is no one else seems to know who she is or that she ever was. Fearing Richard is losing his mind, his friends and allies try to get Richard back on track to lead the D'Haran army to battle against the impending Imperial Order attack. However, Richard is certain that Kahlan is real, and will not give up on her even if that means going against prophecy and risking the battle lost without him to lead the army.The ninth book in the series, Chainfire is the first in a set of three books that Terry Goodkind plans to end this great tale with. I eagerly await the next."
2,"Richard, Kahlan, Richard, Kahlan","Everyone that started this series was blown away by the first book....a truly ""adult"" fantasy. It was awesome! And just like so, so, so, many fantasy series that have a strong book or two, it just goes on and on and needed to end 4 books ago. Lord of the Rings had a plan, and it was awesome because of it. Sword of Truth had a great two books, and now, it is a cycle of the two main characters taking turns playing ""the love of my life is in trouble"". Mr Goodkind, it is ok to end this and start something new! Like everyone else reading this, I too will keep reading to the end. I just wish you knew before hand it would be like this. Of course, it took us 20 years to get through the Dark Tower series....what can one expect!cheers"
4,"OK, I'm ready for #10","Alright I realize this is not the most eloquent thing to say when reviewing a book but here goes anyway...""Chainfire"" kicks a$$! It grabs you from page one and then leaves you begging for more at the end. Yes Mr. Goodkind does get wordy at times (hence the four stars instead of five) but those words go a long way toward bringing his world to life. I for one like the references to his earlier works. Unlike some I don't go back and re-read every book again before reading a new one (not that that is a bad thing) so it helps to refresh my memory of past events. As for those people who talk about all the preaching and philosophying, well, just read the book and enjoy it for what it is, fantasy."
3,"Good book, though repetitive.","As of this writing, I am in the middle of Confessor, the last of this series. Chainfire started off intriguing, then got repetitive with Richard constantly trying to convince people Kahlan exists. Luckily, the finale is good."
4,IT NEVER ENDS........,"THE SWORD OF TRUTH IS A WONDERFUL GROUP OF BOOKS, BUT THE MAINPROBLEM IS MR. GOODKIND SEEMS TO HAVE TROUBLE ENDING THE STORY.GRANTED IT IS AN INTERESTING STORY BUT TEN VOLUMES, PLEASE!IT HE WOULD NOT REPEAT SO MUCH AND GET ON WITH THE STORY I'M SUREHE COULD HAVE DONE IT IN SAY FOUR VOLUMES.TAKE DAVID EDDINGS, NOW HE KNOWS HOW TO WRITE SOME GREAT STORIES.HE ALSO KNOWS HOW TO DRAW THEM TO A CLOSE IN SUCH A WAY YOU ARENOT BEAT TO DEATH WITH REPEATS AND A DRAWN OUT AFFAIR.I HAVE ALL OF THE SWORD OF TRUTH BOOKS AND HAVE READ THEM. NOWHOPEFULLY THIS LAST BOOK WILL END THIS EPIC TALE. THESE AREWORTH READING IF YOU HAVE A GREAT DEAL OF TIME. I SKIP OVER ALOTOF HIS REPEATS, AND DISCRIPTIONS BECAUSE IT TAKES TOO MUCH TIMEREADING THE SAME THING OVER AND OVER.STILL IT IS WORTH READING..........."
5,Open your mind.....,"What you all need to realize about Terry Goodkind's philosophies is simply that anyone who complains or disagrees with him in any way is WRONG.W-WorthlessR-RejectedO-One-sidedN-Not rightG-GoofyAnyone who disagrees with Richard Terry Goodkind son of Rahl is not enlightened. Open your mind to the addictive quality of these books, and you will soon be a better person.Please, someone prove your stupidity by arguing. The order is evil, D'Hara is good-swear your mind, body, and soul to Richard to be good like him.OOC: Okay, I was being sarcastic, but I really do love these books. I give this book a perfect five for the pure literary genious of Goodkind. If I have one gripe, it would bethat it bothers me to have Richard treated like being Jesus and Jagang is like Satan. Bonding with Richard to keep the dreamwalker from your mind hits a little close to home for me.I think that Terry might hate God and the Bible, and that bothers me. I will have to stop reading these types of books."
2,spare us,"as close to drudgery,as this master storyteller ever came.he madeup for it though,in phantom.still love ya dude.\"
5,His best book yet in the series.,"This is by far the best of the books so far in my personal opinion. The previous book wasn't bad per se, but it felt like a tangent and not a main part of the story unfolding.This is a very emotional portion of the story."
4,Great book,"I enjoyed this book greatly, I read some negitive reviews prior to reading it and I have to say for all the books that have bad reviewsThe books have impressed me more and more. There is some great character interactions with Zedd, Rikka, Cara, and even Nikki.I highly recommend reading it."
5,2.5 out of 5 stars???? Are you kidding me!?,I think that this is one of the greatest multi-book series that has been written in the last 50 years! The character's are so human that you'd want to know Richard Kahlan Zedd and all the rest! To say that this book will not do well when it hasn't even come out yet is perposterous as well as rude and ignorant! Sure the first 4 were the best but 5-8 have just been as fantastic! I love this series and I thank Mr. Goodkind to have written such a well thought out story! You sir are truly a master of your craft! May your pen be forever as shard as Richard Rahl's sword!
2,I Hope It Gets Better Than This,"I have read all of the Sword of Truth books. Wizards First Rule was awesome and I loved the next few books. The longer the series goes though, the more soapbox speaches and the less story. This book was very dissapointing to me. Terry Goodkind has a great way with the pen, I can't wait for him to get back to telling a story instead of trying to get everyone to believe his philosophy.Another thing that bothers me about these books is the lack of communication between characters. I can't believe what the characters don't tell each other. The characters spend days and weeks together and don't tell each other important things that that almost certainly would. Very dissapointing book in a too long series."
5,A great overview of the most important cases in Constitutional law,"I had a Constitutional Law class while an undergraduate which relied very heavily on this book, and I could not be more satisfied. While I was a chemistry major, I really enjoyed this book because it had the actual written opinions (or significant excerpts thereof) of the most important and precedent-making cases in a variety of topics of Constitutional Law. Having those opinions ready available was great, and the analysis that followed was also quite helpful to get at some of the cases with denser reasoning.Anyway, whether for class or pleasure, a great read and highly recommended."
3,Freshens up Some Blues Classics,"John Hammond delivers a well-rounded set of his interpretations of a who's who of classic blues masters on ""Long As I Have You."" He neither strays too far from the originals nor tries to exceed his own range----which is considerable----so the tunes here sound both fresh and natural.In something of a departure, Mr. Hammond handles only the vocals on the first dozen tracks, and Little Charlie and the Mudcats adeptly handle all the instruments with zest and taste, striking the right tone without sounding harsh and strident, which is a flaw in too many modern blues bands.For the final three tracks, which are all stripped-down bare bones blues, Mr. Hammond adds guitar and harmonica to his vocals with only a washboard to flesh out the sound.I'm glad that we have Mr. Hammond hard at work delivering his common-sense, well-honed take on the blues. Though this session does not invite frequent, repeated listenings, it's worth having."
4,Combo Pack vs. Non-Combo Pack,"There is also single-disc Blu-ray edition (which I bought). So what's the difference? Per the Questar website:""In addition to the Blu-ray disc, this combo pack also includes:1. DVD version of the program(s) that you can play in your DVD player, vehicle or computer.2. Digital copy of the program that you can download to your computer and/or transfer to your mobile devices."""
4,Funny AND Violent: Does it get any better?!,"Great movie, action packed, VERY funny at times! Wild ride"
3,The movie could've been a little better,This movie was just too far out of touch with reality. I have nothing against imagination but this movie was really way too far-fetched
1,A bad Joke,this film is a bad Joke.it would have been interesting if the film had have been focused but it's all over the place with no real direction at all.Stallone's Ego overrides everything here.Bullock is flat as usual.Snipes isn't challenged at all and it shows.
3,A Fun Diversion,"Predictable action fare with Stallone playing a super cop from 1996 awakened from an unjust cryogenic jail sentence to capture super psycho Snipes (also frozen in 1996) who has escaped the liberal-totalitarian utopian San Angeles (used to be LA) in 2032.None of this movie makes any sense, but its running jokes are amusing. The futuristic society is the apotheosis of political correctness and pacifism, and the only weapons are those on display in a museum...and fortunately for Snipes' character, the pacifist nimrods displayed fully functional firearms, with plenty of of ammo. Fortunately, this movie doesn't take itself too seriously. You know how it's all going to end, and there are no real surprises along the way, but the running gags (that every restaurant is Taco Bell--the only one to survive the Franchise Wars--that toilet paper has been replaced by three seashells, that people receive demerits for cursing) and comic-strip action are enough to sustain the movie."
5,EXCELLENT!,"Definitely a great movie, Demolition Man, brings to the screen the story of a police officer who is released after spending 36 years frozen in a new high-tech cryo-prison, in order to hunt down his arch-nemesis, who also happens to be the one responsible for sending him to prison in the first place.The film combines humor, action and adventure making it one of the best of its kind.Needless to say, Sylvester Stallone, Wesley Snipes, Sandra Bullock, Rob Schneider, and the rest of the cast have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least! All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is AMAZING)!The setting, the dialogues, the special effects, the music and the costumes are all wonderful!In short, it is a movie definitely worth watching and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection! Strongly recommended along with Judge Dredd."
1,Not worth buying -- even used.,"Low-brow as expected - given the cast - but with none of the satiric, ironic, or even pseudo-sociological value I've come to expect from viewing similar movies.This is a movie that apparently, distantly, dreams of somehow being camp, relevant or fun.Fail.Whatever the intention, this is a movie not worthy of time or money."
4,This Has EVERYTHING!!!(except for a few things but its cool),This action packed hilarious thriller that is starring Stallone as a 1996 cop that could catch any criminal that he wanted and Wesley Snipes as the hilarious but ruthless crimanal that is supposedly the most dangerous crimanal form the 90's. They are both frozen until about 2050. Now everything is so peaceful that you get arrested for saying a curse word more than once. Wesley Snipes escapes and causes so much havoc that the po-pos can't handle it so they unfreeze Sylvester Stallone and he releases hell on every criminal there. So watch this great action packed and hilarious movie with teen and get ready to laugh and jump when watching. Great for all kinds of audiences unless you are wanting a really serious dramatic action like the Last Boy Scout.
5,I Wish I Were An Oscar Mayor...,"Imagine doing your job overly well, getting sentenced to prison for it, cryogenic-ally frozen and waking up to face the same bad guy in a romper room society and there you have the basis of Demolition Man. A society where cops are basically security guards without guns and people are peaceful and well intended... Or are they. Benjamen Bratt and Sandra Bullock are so funny singing ""oldies"" which are really commercials from bygone days. Stallone is very funny in this role dealing with the ""warm-fluffy"" society. I would recommend it but it's far less than typical Stallone fodder."
2,Friday the Rabbi Slept Late,It was OK. Didn't hold my interest. Slow beginning to the story. It took me quite awhile to finish.I'm not going to recommend this book.
4,Amusing and educational,"Kemelman's Rabbi books are light, amusing mysteries, with a Jewish pedagogical element that is interesting though slightly disruptive to the flow of the story. Many of these books show the idealistic Rabbi reconciled to his quarrelsome congregation by a feat of deduction supposedly aided by Jewish ideas. Put this way, it doesn't sound too promising, but I like it."
5,Angela's Ashes,"This book was a very inlighting experience. It made me look at all the things I myself take for granted. I was lucky growing up. I lived in the same home, had food on the table, and clothes to wear. I was very lucky! Thanks Frank McCourt for opening my eyes to those less fortunate than I."
3,"Good, not great","Angela's Ashes is a heartbreaking story about growing up desperately poor. It is a story about the underside of Irish Catholicism. It is a story of growing up in a totally dysfunctional family. It is an easy read and captures the reader.I question the validity of this as a memoir. It seems too harsh and too detailed on early life experiences. How much of this memoir consist of family stories that have been filtered by numerous retellings? How much of is diatribe against the English and organized religion? We will never know, but his seems to be the case.The book is a good and worthwhile read, but I really did not feel that it is too slanted by political correctness."
5,Amazing Storytelling,One of my favorite books. A walk in the life of Frank McCourt's deprived and poverty stricken family. Wonderfully written a real page turner.
3,Angelas Ashes,"The awful life that Frank McCourt lived became wearing after a while, I think this is or can be a common problem with many memoirs they go on and on about the same theme too long for me."
2,Ach! 'Tis deeply disappointing!,"Frank McCourt's writing style is fantastic, but the content of Angela's Ashes leaves much to be desired. I like a book that teaches moral integrity, that shows that man or woman can overcome the filth of everyday life. This book did not meet that criteria."
2,Did I Miss Something?,"After reading this book following a couple of years of hype, I'm left scratching my head.I found Mr. McCourt's book a slow moving compendium of seemingly unconnected anecdotes. I'm an experienced reader of memoirs so I am familiar and comfortable with the format. Angela's Ashes recounts nothing exceptional in the three hundred and forty odd pages. But maybe that's the whole point. Maybe there's a Pulitzer lurking in all of our childhoods, most of which are as unexceptional as Mr. McCourt's.To be fair, the ending salvaged the book. I breezed rather than labored through the final forty pages. Then again, perhaps I read the final few pages quickly to bring an end to this boring book."
5,An incredible memoir that made me laugh and cry.,"Never before have I read or listened to a book that so effectively drew me into the lives of the characters. I deliberately postponed finishing it only because I couldn't bear to say goodbye to Frankie, Malachy, Question Quigley and all the other characters I came to love. The author somehow managed to write a book that is both heartwarming and heart-tugging. At times I found myself laughing out loud thanks to the author's hysterical descriptions. At other times, tears would well up over yet another senseless death. ""Angela's Ashes"" is truly a testiment to the human spirit and one of the finest books I have ever read."
2,Not my idea of a great read,"Although McCourt is a gifted writer, and I did enjoy many sections of the book, I found it too depressing with few redeeming qualities. As a Catholic growing up in the 1950's, I could identify with the numerous occasions of sin he portrayed. However, the ending was flat - and unrealistic. It seemed as if Mr. McCourt got bored with all the misery and body fluids and just wanted it over. The title has no relevance to anything in the book - ""Angela's Ashes"" appears to refer to his Mother, whom he left alive and well in Ireland and not deceased. I shall be more cautious about running out to buy any of Oprah's Book Club Selections."
5,Well Done Frank McCourt!,"Generally I do not read books. I don't have the time or the patience. However, I was taking a holiday break abroad and thought that it would be a good idea to get a book for the flight to try to keep me occupied on the journey. I couldn't believe what a moving and gripping tale this was. Frank McCourt couldn't have done better. For three days it kept me quiet. What a good idea to tell the tale through the eyes of a child. Although it is a sad account of Frank's upbringing I found parts of the book very funny. I am looking forward to reading 'Tis' and have just ordered Angela's Ashes on DVD. Excellent."
5,A Definite must-read,"Excellent, through and through. Couldn't put it down. Solid scientific arguments together with fluid writing style add up to a blockbuster... A friend I gave the book to later told me he was still up at 1AM reading it and didn't want to stop. The book is chock full of persuasive arguments showing how homosexuality is not genetic, and how many people who used to be homosexual have been able to be free of unwanted same-sex attractions through specialized therapy. I've met some of these people who are now happily married with children. Get this book!"
3,not bad...but not that great,this album had its high points but there r way 2 many space filler tracks that dont seem 2 go anywhere or do anything. this album wuz basically a compilation with only 1 song by Scarface without somebody featured. Face is better when he is alone rippin a track. worth buying but i would suggest Untouchable
4,R&B Remix to Switch is all you need.,"I hate the original. I'll be point blank. I think it's trash. I didn't know what Will was thinking with that version. But then I remembered the MIB2 (Black Suits Comin) song...and then it made sense.Then I heard the R&B; Remix to Switch, and I was hooked. THIS is what Will Smith is good at, this style is perfect for him and leaves him at the top of his game. I don't think it's a sampled beat, or if it is, it's a very minimal sample, because I don't recognize it. It's just good."
1,Doesn't even use country music,"This was a sad excuse for a ""country"" workout. There's no country music and only a small handful of the moves have a country feel to them. The video seems barely rehearsed as the two girls supporting the instructor often struggle to get the choreography right. She seems to make the routine up as she goes along and mumbles a lot. I suppose I could recommend this to a beginner who doesn't need a very complicated workout because it was extremely boring for me and not at all challenging. I had to put another workout video in right after this to make up for the lack of a decent workout."
3,"good, but not great","This entry is a good, solid written, book. The authors are sure of their program, and it should give you results, if followed correctly. But there is a problem with this book. It is written too seriously. It is filled with references made to other great works of seuxal discussions. It is a clinical approach to a personal problem. I liked it, but it was far from being tongue-in-cheek, or written with an eye for humor. It is both very serious, and very straight forward in its' aproach. That is my only complaint with the book. I think the guide to getting it on was written far better, covered the subject better, and did it with full humor and a touch of magic. It was a far more interesting, fun-filled, and informative read than this book was. It is worth the money, but no where near the amounts of fun. Where does it say that great satisfying sex has to be serious?"
4,clear and present danger,Quality is very good and the time that it took to receive this movie was perfect. This is a very good movie
4,A very clear danger,"This is the second best film of the Jack Ryan series because the first is The Hunt For Red October. Tom Clancy is my favorite author and I think Hollywood should make more movies out of his books. Harrison Ford should have been casted to be Jack Ryan in the first one as well. This is a good drug war movie and if you love movies where there are people from the CIA, then this is for you. Great sourround sound and just a solid dvd. I really did enjoy the special feature on this behind the danger. It was helpful and interesting. It overall was a really cool movie with a fantastic plot. I think this si better than Patriot Games. It does not get old and is just a fast paced movie. I take a star off because I was looking for a little bit more action. Buy it if you like the Jack Ryan series. God bless you and have a great day."
1,It won't play,The dvd won't play in either one of my dvd players. I was really looking forward to watching it too.
3,headphones style not SQ,"I purchased these phones because I was looking for a clean style, well thats what I got. The sound quality is bad. They do not get very loud and do not put out very much bass at all. The $20 earbuds they sell put out a lot better sound quality. If your looking for style get them, looking for SQ I advise you to stay away, take a look at some higher quality phones for SQ."
4,First Fashion Step,"If you want to get an amazing grip on your colors, this is the book. It covers all skin pigmentations so you need not fear that it will only work if you are white. My only negative comment to the book is about the advice on clothing styles. Ignore it. It is a small part of the book so no need to worry. The color work is beyond phenomenal and worth the book's price."
3,"Pretty, But Is It Useful?","This is beautiful, and multi-cultural; a visually lovely book. However, it's light on style and wardrobe-building, and not terribly useful to an individual. Caucasian, African-American, Asian, and Latinas are all presented here, in their multicolored splendor. If ever a self-help/beauty book could go on a coffee table, this would be it.I am only giving this book 3 stars because of its limited usefulness to a single person. If you're an image consultant, it would be much more useful to you, because of its broad ethnic scope. I'd like to rate it higher because it's pretty, but pretty doesn't help you find your style and colors, does it? I do recommend it, and would confidently recommend it to a friend - as a library book."
5,Awesome CD,"This entire album is really outstanding. The guitar-playing is the real deal. My favorite track is ""Sneaking Around"", an old-style, kickin' blues song with heavy guitar. This has become one of my favorites."
4,goulet,"If youre looking for a similar sound to Alphabetical, this is not it. ""Its never Been Like That"" is a mix of the less notable tracks from ""United"" and some funk and soul from ""Alphabetical"". Like I said before, you'll be disappointed if youre looking for the same sound as Alphabetical, but dont be turned off. The Cd is actually really great, but it will take a few listens to really like it. I think ""Consolation Prizes"" , ""Courtesy Laughs"", and ""Napolean Says"" are the best track while ""Lost and Found"" and ""North"" arent the best. All the other tracks are good and will still take a few more listens for me to cozy up to. I think a good band is one that keeps reinventing themselves and is contstantly changing and Phoneix does that well."
3,Not bad but not great,"I went to the store to get the most recent CD by Phoenix (The Mozart one) because what I heard on the radio was pretty good! I hadn't heard any earlier Phoenix music at that time. This (It's never been like that) was the only CD by Phoenix the store had (released in 2006). I have been listening to it for a few days and can say, it's definately not the same as what is being played now on the radio. It's not a bad CD but it's not what you would expect if you are just getting into them in 2010. Just be prepared if you purchase it. Take the time to listen to samples before buying. You may like it and may not.I felt the CD had a slow start. I'm not that interested in the first 2-3 songs. I frequently fwd past them. The next few songs are somewhat catchy but in my opinion are nothing to rave about. This CD feels like they were still finding out what they wanted to be.I give the ""band"" 3-4 stars and this particular CD 3."
3,Not Topless,"The edition I received did not show a frontal view of Gillian Anderson topless. The movie showed very little of G Anderson. The movie was a sermon against and a slap against rural Southerners. The acting was good but the plot was sick. The movie portrayed rural North Carolina people as ignorant and unsophisticated. It was typical Hollywood subliminal, left-wing, liberal propaganda as spouted by CBS, ABC, NBC, Ted Kennedy, Al Sharpton, and Jesse Jackson. Don't waste your money. You won't see what you've heard of Gillian Anderson."
3,good for casual watching,"This was movie that explored the life of a young man returning to a broken home. His life shattered, he lashs out trying to keep his life together. It was a decent film for occasional watching but the slow storyline and limited plot lessens the quality. The one saving grace for this movie was the great acting job done by ""Gillian Anderson"" (more known for her role as Agent Dana Scully). Though a small part she has done a great job and is able to save the movie and add an extra star to the rating."
3,Christine Lindberg vs. Laura Gemser,"If only the Christine Lindberg -Laura Gemser 70's euro-chicks team had been willing to take a crack at making fun of shocking 70's euro movies (the first ""Emanuelle !"" movie came out that year in the 70's), we might have actually had a decent sex movie parody."
3,"Hard to watch--very sad story, yet compelling","Make sure you have beverages on hand if you watch this! It is the story of four rather silly people who take off into the desert on a photo shoot with very few supplies and not much water. After their car is smashed, they face the dilemma of trying to walk out of the merciless desert heat. And one of them is pregnant....and another has a concussion and a hematoma. I do not want to spoil it any further. Suffice to say that you will feel the suffering.The acting could have been better from the guys, but the gals were pretty good, esp. Lacey Chabert."
3,its straight,"this is album is good, i got his first album, gone on that bay and that one is serious but this album dont seem to be as good, some of the earlier songs was good but as the album went on it didnt appeal to me as much. but overall this is still a gangsta album"
3,Inept worker and writer,I am a big fan of the internet and I buy quite a few items from Amazon but I don't see them as the end all. They are good at their game though. However Mr. Marcus sees them with a disdainful childish view which inhibits his writing and outlook. The book is hard to read with his constant complaining that breaks up the flow of the story which I presumed was to be about Amazon and not him. You learn very little about Amazon or the founder. He has the typical whining ungrateful attitude of those who view capitalism as a necessary evil but do not refuse the benefits such as stock options and the rising price of their stock. Then at the end he has the gall to believe that Mr.Bezos would appreciate reading his book. Read this book solely to grasp this was an idea whose time had come because of the net and Mr. Bezos and could not be stopped even by employees such as the writer.
2,Dull re-visit to already covered territory,"As a current Amazonian I looked forward to reading this book by a former colleague. Unfortunately, Mr. Marcus' work falls far short of expectations. Covering much of the same ground as Mike Daisey in ""21 Dog Years..."" and Robert Spector in ""Get Big Fast,"" the author brings neither Daisey's sweaty sense of humor nor Spector's euphoria about e-commerce to a look at the first years of Amazon.com. Marcus seems light on the facts (he messes up more than a small number of time frames) and bored by his subject matter. As a writer I expected a better story and as an insider I know that there is more that he could have told. Sadly, this is not the definitive book on Amazon.com."
1,Annoying,"There is one aspect of this book that I found REALLY annoying which let down my reading experience.I found myself searching through my dictionary almost as often as I blinked. James, congratulations you have a great vocabulary *puke*"
3,Interesting,"James Marcus was an editor and one of the earlier employees at Amazon. His recollection of the first years at Amazon is quite interesting. What makes it less interesting to me is that he was an editor and he believes that this function was a critical piece of Amazon. He gripes with the idea - and complains a lot - that Amazon became more automated (more technical) and he (and his colleagues) weren't needed anymore. I actually think that the editorial stuff wasn't really the most important so I cannot accept his complaints. I would love to read a similar account written on behalf of the Amazon' technical stuff. Still, the account of 'irrational exuberance' of the start-up (somewhat familiar to me) and how it is becoming more an more something like typical corporate stiff culture is entertaining. I found annoying that the author is trying to show how educated he is. The chapter devouted to Raplh Emerson seems totally out of place here. Nevertheless, I enjoyed the book."
1,Taylor Thermoneter,The device is poorly designed and assembled. The switch labeling is poor. The ON/OFF switched only worked after repeated attempts. Very erratic. Absolutely no water protection.
1,"Like the others, used once and then dead","As seems to be the usual for this product, I bought it, used it once, put it in a drawer, and then found it dead upon next use a month or two later.No response from the vendor.Wasn't mistreated. Just a garbage product."
3,Skip if you are a messy cook,Not a good choice for making chocolate truffles - you do not want to get food in the button mechanism and the cover does not attach to the probe to extend your grip/reach. OK product - would not buy again.
3,battery replacement,"Battery's don't last long. Steps to replace the battery in the previous review are right on. One suggestion, at step 4 do not remove the battery cover plate, rather, loosen the screw, and then raise the cover plate enough to slide the battery in and then retighten the screw. Battery type is ordinary Duracell DL2032. A couple of bucks at your local grocery store. Buy a couple, you will need them."
3,A warrior idenitity crisis?,"Most of the editorial reviews on this book found in major media outfits praise this book. It is also praised by Republicans and conservatives.I however find the book to be a bit of a stretch. The thinking is thin, the only deep, critical or insightful part of the book is the introduction and conclusion. The case studies, while braced with with that initial inquiry, are thin and one dimensional.It assumes that the reader is somehow seeking a warrior identity, a mythic structure or meta-narrative. This is childish. It further makes these ""mythic structures and meta-narratives"" which somehow resemble the creatures and cultures of dungeons and dragons game, about every country except the US.I think this book grew out of the authors flights of fancy, and she simply wanted a way to justify her D&D; games."
5,Beautifully Made Book; Full of Awe-Inspiring Images,"This is one of the most beautifully published books I have ever had the pleasure of viewing. If you love animals, photography, or just high quality book publishing, this one will bring a great deal of satisfaction. Lanting's images transcend mere animal identification shots as he clearly develops a relationship with each of his subjects. When you look at a portrait of a chimpanzee, you see pride and when you look at a photo of a family of Emperor penguins, you feel all the symbolic meaning of parenting on a spiritual level. Full of amazing photographs, this magnificent book makes a great gift (my mom loved hers) and comes highly recommended!"
5,A lesson about dignity ...,"From the elephant up to the insect, from the cayman up to the seal every animal looks us in the eyes deeply. ""Less than the human being: - the monkey follows in the system of zoology according to an immense ravine. If one, however, once wanted to organize the animals after her bliss, cosiness etc., then some people would come to stand anyway apparently under the miller donkeys and hounds ... "", 250 years ago the nature scientist Georg Christoph Lichtenberg already wrote. However, he did not have a camera yet to hand to cover this. Frans Lanting, however, shows us the determination with which snow geese and ibisses, penguins or zebras are away to something, shows us her family care and the dignity of animals in liberty - at times, when more and more people feel caught - a book which reminds us that ""upright walking""- that synonymous of the philosophers for courage and self-respect - that you can make it true even on all four paws..."
3,Babies love this!,"Though the book says it's for 18-month-olds and up, my nine-month-old daughter LOVES this book. It's one of her favorites. She laughs and smiles while looking at it. She loves looking under the flaps and she eagerly grabs at the flap on each page. She caught on immediately. She also loves the mirror at the end of the book and kisses her image. She likes it so much that I was looking for a similar book on amazon.com when I wrote this review!"
4,Just what I wanted!,"The ring is beautiful! It arrived well before the expected date. The rose is small, detailed,and dainty. When I first wore it, I received so many compliments.It does get caught on things, but what ring doesn't? The band has become a bit deformed in the month I have had it, but it still fits perfectly. If you are looking for an elegant accessory, I would recommend this one."
2,"Great music, uninspiring video","I would like to give this video only one star but Spyro Gyra's great music alone makes it deserving of two. Being that this video is out of print, I bought it from one of Amazon's third party sellers. I soon found out why this video is out of print.I expected to watch a video which showed either a live concert or scenes of the group playing in the studio with interviews with the members of the band. Instead, this video is simply their songs played one after the other to urban scenes.Skip this video but by all means buy their CD's! Their early works from Morning Dance to Alternating Currents are the best!!"
2,Useless support,"The bra came and although lovely it is useless for support. Also runs very small, as it is I am typically a B cup but in Elle Macpherson I am a D cup! Who manages bra sizes anyway?"
3,Walking Away the Pounds,This one is good using the weights gives you a good work out. However if you use heavier weights it is difficult to keep up the walking and raising the weights above your head. You may want to only use light weights with this workout.
3,"Lots of walking, too much laughing!","Enthusiasm for an instructor is exactly what's needed - but Leslie's constant giggling, laughing and chatting takes away from the momentum that you're trying to achieve...it get annoying and I find I can only do this one day and must switch to something more challenging."
5,"Classic, but Extraordinary!","When shopping CDs, some folks would first look at the release date, and automatically eliminate the older ones, without even examining its content. To those shoppers the CD is ""not up to date"". In other words, they are ""juding a book by its cover"". But that is wrong. One cannot determine a CD by its age. Gang Starr's Moment of Truth is an example. It is a rather classic hip-hop CD, but the songs are incredible! The lyrics are wicked, and the beats are thrilling. Guru and Premier have really done a extraordinary job, alog with other rappers like Inspectah Deck and Big Shug. My personal favorite is The Militia. It well broken down."
5,"One of my favorites. ""Real"" hip-hop.","Nearly all tracks on this CD surpass the sound that Gang Starr is known for. Guru comes on and stays strong with thoughtful lyrics, rapped to DJ Premier's hypnotic beats.Practically all tracks on this CD have a message, or at least a meaning. After you get over your hypnosis by Premier's beats, listen hard to the lyrics: you might get something from them.Appearances by other rappers were lacking on previous CDs, but this releases fixes that: appearances by Inspectah Deck, K-Ci & JoJo, M.O.P. and Scarface are really a plus.Though Gang Starr has been a strong force in the underground community, Guru, for some reason, decided to record ""The Mall,"" a debauchery to the whole Gang Starr Foundation, in which he raps about brand name clothing and going to the mall, just like all the other commercial radio rappers. Minus this track, the whole CD is excellent."
4,ARE THE NATIONAL TREASURE BLU-RAY'S MULTI-REGIONAL ?,This isn't a ' review ' as such - merely a Question !I want to get the 2 National Treasure dvd's on Blu-ray - but wanted to know if like most Blu-ray dvd's - they will be playable in Europe ? Anyone please ?
3,Good but not as good as the original.,Decent follow up to Get Shorty has a good amount of humor to spare but it lacks the coolness and wit of the original. John Travota once again does well with his role but the rest of the movie does not deserve his effort in reprising it.See it for Travota only but don't expect anything close to the original.
2,REALLY BAD,I HATED THIS MOVIE. I THOUGHT IT WAS REALLY STUPID AND POINTLESS.THE ONLY FUNNY PARTS IN THE MOVIE ARE THE ONES WITH THE ROCK. I WISH I HADN'T WASTED MY TIME WITH THIS MOVIE SO DONT WASTE YOURS.
2,Aimless. Empty. Shallow. Dull.,When is John Travolta going to find a screen role worthy of his talent?
5,Light Entertainment,I was plesently surprised that I enjoyed this movie. I loved GET SHORTY and I really wanted to see BE COOL but the bad reviews kept me away at first. But it was a boring saturday afternoon and we decided to hit the movies and this is what we picked. I found BE COOL charming and funny. Is not laugh out loud funny but witty and lightweight. This is a great film to watch just to pass the time. Overall BE COOL is relaxing entertainment and if I may... cool.Plus Uma and John are wonderful in a lovely reunion to PULP FICTION.
2,Not worth watching,"All ""style"" and no substance. Even the dance number with John Travolta & Uma Thurman was lackluster. And would Cedric The ""Entertainer"" please go away? I've never seen anything with him in it that was any good. I should have known just by his presence in the movie it was going to be a dud. I think Christina Milian's voice is good but not so great to make such a fuss over."
2,Horrible,"Be cool proves that a big cast full of big names do not make a good movie. With so many actors, you'd think it would be a good movie. There a very few funny scenes, and the plot is boring and long. It really goes no where in it's 120 minutes. A potential movie turns to mush."
4,Be funny,"Great movie, although it is very similar to get shorty I liked this one better, just because Uma Thurman rocks"
3,"Good, but not a great introduction to Lincoln","This was an excellent historical record of probably the greatest American that ever lived. However, it has long, complex, diffcult to read wording that makes it somewhat labor-intensive reading. The content is great, but there are far easier to read (and understand) books about Lincoln."
3,The Chinese Chop,"Old fashion mystery set in New York City 1949. New author Janice Cameron shares a rented room with the mysterious Lily Wu in a house in Washington Square. 2 murders occur. It seems each one of the residents in the house has a secret past, with the exception of Janice, and could be the murderer. Very very medium after a while. The most interesting thing about the book is the tone and time it was written which was 1949."
5,Excellent Book,"This is a fantastic book especially if you are looking from a historical perspecive. The book is very intellegently written, and it is very apparent the author spent a great deal of time researching the work. This is not just another rehash as so many other books are. Highly reccommended for any magicians library."
1,Too Small For My Phone!,"i have a Motorola i410 flip phone and this case does not fit it! its a nice well made case, but i dont know how it could be advertised to fit the Motorola 1410 phone, when its clearly too small!"
4,Love this cutter,"I make a lot of Art trading cards. When I got tired of measuring and cutting by hand over & over, I tried this out & love it. For small cutting it is fast & efficient. Also I don't get the torn edges with this guillotine cutter that I get with my mat cutter if the blade is not at perfect sharpness."
1,Message From Nam Movie,This movie does not work. I am not able to watch the movie. It would have been nice to have been able to have a product I could use. =(
5,Swing Shift,Great movie. Wanted it for my personal collection as well as to show at school for my US History class. Good look at women's roles during WWII.
5,I am on my way to the corner office!,"AN AWESOME READ! By reading ""Nice Girls Don't Get the Corner Office,"" I feel like I can make the changes needed to further my career and soon be in the corner office myself. I have bought copies for my sister, mother and close female friends and they have all enjoyed it immensely. I also found Dr. Frankel's other book, ""Overcoming Your Strengths,"" helpful to my career. The tips in her books are insightful and make a definite difference."
2,Have a backbone...choose to be a nice girl,"The advice in this book looks good on the surface, but it is ultimately about feeding selfish ambition, rather than valuing oneself and exercising true leadership through service.For example, the book's ""Mistake 10 - Being the Conscience"" mentions women who have bravely stood against corruption. But Frankel's take is that it is generally a mistake to stand beside ""rigid interpretations"". The truth is that if any of us (male or female) don't have the backbone to abide by and advocate a higher standard, we don't deserve to be leaders in our organizations.This book will confuse people about what to do in otherwise clear-cut situations. I suggest instead the book ""The Servant"" by James C Hunter. It goes to the heart of true leadership.This book also devalues girlhood and the best qualities of nice girls: kindness, modesty, collaboration. These are the very qualities most needed now by our families, communities, and organizations."
3,nice girls don't get the corner office,Read this book with a grain of salt. It might not be for you. If you believe in the glass ceiling for women then you want to read it.
3,So/So,"If you're a mild-mannered, timid woman this book may be helpful for you. If you're already confident and secure with yourself, there isn't much here for you..."
4,Great Necessary Quick Read,This was a great quick read. Although I thought some parts of the book went a bit overboard by suggesting women keep shorter haircuts like their male counterparts (long hair is part of what makes us women afterall!). The book overall offered some great tips on how to stop short of sabotaging your career and suggested ways to get ahead. It gave some great examples of women who fell into the trap. I definitely got a lot out of this book.
5,Excellent!,I enjoyed this book and found the tips very helpful. Many of her suggestions are easily applicable and I found that I saw results almost immediately.
4,Good book but I'd recomend NOT TO GET THE KINDLE VERSION,"*** I'd strongly recommend picking up a HARD COPY of this book, I am reading it on my iPad and I wish I'd paid for a hard copy to scribble in the margins and post-it the action items I ought to focus on. (See more info on why in comments)*****I'm only a couple chapters into this book and thus far it's got me to a T! Within the first few examples I saw myself in situations that either I handled poorly or completely inadequately but Frankel's action points and suggestions have already helped me top and think about how I ought to have handled a situation and how the outcome could have been not only better but beneficial for my professional development if I'd handled them better.Based on what I've read so far any working woman should read this book. Heck all women should read this book, I can see ways I can develop personally through all her professional recommendations as well."
3,"Not Bad, But Not The Best","Before I get into the book, I must say that the best book about money and finance and the like isMake Money at Home: A Quick Guide: Special Edition.Now as for ""Nice Girls Don't Get the Corner Office,"" the book is well-written, and offers insider's tips on how to move ahead in your career. It explains how you can refine your social and thinking skills, and develop new ones, to help you climb the career ladder. It explains why some women succeed, and while others don't.Generally, it points out behaviors that keep women from reaching their financial potential, and helps you fix them in order to improve your situation.A simple, nice read."
1,Unuseable tutorial,"I gave up on this book at chapter 2. Why? Well, the author said ""Create a rollover in Fireworks or your favorite graphics program."" Who said I know how to create rollovers? If I knew that what good is this program to me? I happen to have Fireworks but haven't learned it yet. So I went to the Fireworks manual to look up when it teaches rollovers: chapter 16! I then tried to import a rollover that Fireworks includes but it wouldn't go into Dreamweaver. The author seems so bent on showing off his prowess that he forgets that we beginners don't know anything. And I check the targeted audience: Beginner to Advanced! My suggestion: (1) Though Macromedia sells Dreamweaver and Dreamweaver UltraDev, these are, from a learning perspective two different programs and you have to learn Dreamweaver before approaching UltraDev; (2) Buy Dreamweaver 4 Hands-On-Training by Lynda Weinman and Garo Green. That book is great!"
2,Nothing new here,"Nothing you could not find for free in internet.I'm glad if the authors are making any profit from this book, because I doubt they are earning much by trading if all they know is put in here..."
5,fun listening for the whole family,Makes mundane jobs more fun when the whole family can listen to familiar tunes! Makes me want to watch the movie again & again!
5,Buy this Soundtrack,I love this soundtrack. I was in a play about the sound of music and i fell in love with the songs.
1,This CD is disappointment version of this soundtrack.,"I have had the Long Playing Version of Sound of Music, and the cassette version of this soundtrack too, and the sound was greater (STEREO) than this recent CD version. But when I bought this new issue it was a disappointment the sound was in the antique MONO, this belongs to the early 60's. The sound of this CD is flat and obscure. The technical features of this edition don't mention the media they use to make this poor CD. Digitalization is a resource available, but his one was a bad copy of an old Long Playing too waste for the years it has been in use. They omit the Wedding March, Edelweiss, and the introduction of the film reprise. If you want a better version, please, check in the Technical Data of sound for a complete description about the copy you are buying."
5,Awesome soundtrack!,"This cd is awesome. If you are looking for enjoyable, safe, quality, family music this is it and at a nice price, too.Thanks!"
5,L,This is a wonderful musical and having the music to enjoy anytime you wish is great. I would definitely recommend.
3,Sound of Music audio CD,"The audio quality is superb. Very clear, very sibilant. Unfortunately it is loaded with a number of interviews at the end and after hearing them once, they are boring. Don't put this CD into a random track selection."
4,Incomplete Sound of Music,"Unfortunately this CD is not the complete soundtrack. It cuts off the end of Sixteen Going on Seventeen, it doesn't offer the original time that the Captain and Liesel sing Edelweiss, it doesn't offer the music in the chase scene or the complete wedding music. An audio tape was released that had the complete music--unfortunately we lost our copy and I purchased this cd instead, but I'm always disappointed when I hear it. If you are a true fan of the complete album or the complete movie, you may be disappointed."
5,How can you possibly go wrong with this classic?,"You've seen the film. You know the music. This CD is a winner.Everyone is familiar with the tracks - ""My Favorite Things,"" ""Do-Re-Mi,"" ""Edelweiss""...What amazes me about this album is that I find new things to like each time I listen to it. I have just recently begun to appreciate Julie Andrews' spirited ""I Have Confidence"", for example. And ""The Lonely Goatherd"" never fails to bring a smile to my face.My children especially enjoy listening to this album and singing along."
5,An All-Time Favorite,"I was just five years old when this movie came out. I remember seeing it in a big, old-fashioned theater (back when movie theaters had just ONE screen..remember?)I didn't understand the plot of the movie at that age, of course, but I loved the songs just the same. The image of Maria on top of the hill, singing the title song so beautifully, is indelibly imprinted in my mind.Since then, of course, I have watched this movie over and over, and never grow tired of it. I have heard people say that the stage production is better than the movie, but I have never seen the stage production, so cannot make the comparison. Still, I have a hard time imagining anything more beautiful than Julie Andrews' voice, which is a true treasure.They just don't make movies like this anymore. Too bad."
4,Love,"Well, you gotta love this musical, so the soundtrack is worth every penny to see the whole family singing along. :)"
4,"Wood Veneer,Oak, Red Flat","This product arrived in great condition, pleased with the quality but looks lighter in color than the picture shown. It looks more like white oak than red, but with some adjustments, it worked for my project.ThanksMG"
5,chooz,This great anti-acid chewing gum used to be sold everywhere. now you can't find it anywhere. I was glad to be able to find it on Amazon. The price is right and the shipping quick. What more can you ask for?
4,Give it Time,"I bought this years ago and listened to it a couple times and didn't really care for it. Felt like it was too much ""all over the map"" and the talking lesson in between songs sounded a bit contrived. I planned on selling it on Ebay and then years later decided to play it again. I have played it about 25 times now in the past 3 weeks and I really dig it. There is a lot going on here musically and vocally, it is a major production. It must have taken many hours if not months or years to produce this album. I strongly recommend it for people who are musically mature enough to enjoy all types of music coming at you all in on one disc. Give it a chance, it does take some time. This is encompassing world music."
3,A great video for bringing back those early MTV days.,Basically a collection of all their old videos which serves as a great reminder of their early work and what was the basis of Sting's current styles. Great video for old fans of The Police.
4,Are there videos missing,"The videos that are on the dvd are great and watching the band mature through them is very interesting. However, for the life of me I can't seem to find the video of ""Roxanne"" where the band is singing against the red walls and floor which is the primary reason I bought this dvd. Does anyone know where I can find it?"
3,"The songs are MUCH faster than on CD, too!","To add to how awful the mix is (my DVD has several sound setting options, none of which correct the problem -- e.g. ""Wrapped Around Your Finger"" has no synthesizers) the songs, most noticable on the ones off Ghost in the Machine, are MUCH faster than released on record/tape/cd. If you're as big of a fan as I am, these in particular sound like old records played on the wrong speed. I'm glad I have this dvd for the bonus features, but now I wish I had the first out of print pressing of the videos in the hopes of correcting the problem this dvd creates."
5,I'm a beginner but bought this anyway,"I'm only a beginning guitar player but my teacher encouraged me to get this book anyway, for all the interesting/useful information it contains...even though I don't plan to be actively working on my dinky accoustic guitar anytime soon, I recently aquired a new Fender Telecaster, so i am even more grateful to have this book now. It's fascinating just to flip through and read at random...nice to get to know the physical mechanics of the guitar better even if I never plan to do any home repair work."
5,"Great battery, fantastic speedy service","I highly recommend this product and more over the place where I ordered it from was very fast with my order, had one outstandingly great pricing! have you compared the pricing of this to how much they sell them for in the local stores, it's a total rip off. Go with these guys, they won't do you wrong, that's for sure :)"
1,Tired batteries sold as new,"I bought two of these batteries a month apart for my Razr. When received, both were 4 years old based on the manufacture date on the outside. That's a problem because lithium ion batteries degrade while in storage. These performed no better than the 4-year-old battery they were supposed to replace.I recently bought a BR56 battery directly from Motorola. When received, it was 1.5 years old. With it, my phone performs like new and I don't have to constantly think about conserving power."
3,Motorola V300 Battery,This battery doesn't seem to hold a charge for very long. I'm not sure if it is just the particular phone I am using it with or not?
1,Won't hold a charge,"Battery will only stay charged for 16 hours with very little phone use. If you talk for 20 or 30 minutes, you need to re-charge. Very disappointing."
3,Okay for the price.,"I'm not sure it lasts as long as it should. I have to charge it every night, b/c it will not last through till the next day, which I was able to do at first with the original battery. I have an old phone, so I don't care to spend a lot of money on a good battery, and it does it's job, so overall, I'm satisfied with it's performance."
3,Did not receive product as described,"I ordered this because it was supposed to be the ""OEM SNN5794 Battery"". I received a SNN5696E Battery instead, which fits the phone, but it doesn't seem to last very long. I am not a long talker on my cell, so it is mostly on standby. My original battery would last about 5-7 days until I got in pinch with a dead battery and had to make a call, so I used the car charger. Well, that ruined the battery. I was lucky if it would last a one day. This new one that I just got, only lasts about 2-3 days. I feel this company misrepresented the item, making you think you are getting one like the original battery."
3,"Works well, but not the exact battery that I ordered.","I read the reviews before purchasing this battery. Most were positive, however a few did say that it was not exactly as represented. I found that to also be true...I payed a little more and ordered the white SNN5794 and what I received was a black BR50 as a replacement. I am disappointed that I didn't get exactly what I ordered and paid for, but it seems to be working adequately so far. I have a feeling I'll be ordering another one sooner than I had hoped since this is a much cheaper version. I guess it should be ""buyer beware."""
2,Charles,The first battery I received would not hold a charge for more than 2 hours. I contacted the company and they told me I had to charge it 12 hours 3 times being fully depleted each time to determine if it was defective. That seems a little too much. I did it anyway. Then returned it by US postal at my expense. Received a replacement about 4 days later that does hold a charge for about 14 hours with limited use. That is more what I would expect from a new battery. Too bad the first one was such a hassle.
3,Motorola V400 Battery,"I guess I can't complain about a $7 battery but, it does not hold a charge very long. The battery I purchased from Motorola 16 months ago at least held its charge real well for about 14 months."
2,you get what you PAY for!!,The battery was no better than my old one as far as holding a charge.Maybe I should have invested in a new Motorola Battery.
1,A piece of junk from an unexistant outlet,"I ordered a SNN5704 battery for a Razor 3 cell phone from OEM For Cheap, listed on the Amazon web site. I received a BR56 battery presumably ""exactly compatible"". It turned out to be a piece of junk: does not keep the carge, and cuts connection in the middle of the sentence. I tried to contact the company: there is no phone number and the E-mail address they give on the shipping order is fictitious.AdrSpi"
2,Motorola V551 battery,"I bought this battery in May 09. By Aug 09 it would no longer hold a charge. My original battery which is 3+ yrs. old still lasts longer than this replacement. The transaction was swift and smooth, though. Unfortunately the product was garbage. Reluctant to do repeat business."
3,Not what I expected,"I purchased the Hoagy Carmichael Songbook cd. Unfortunately, Amazon did not have any ""samples"" of the songs. The quality of the cd is excellent but the songs are not versions I would have preferred. The cd is just ""okay"" but not what I truly wanted."
3,This isn't the book to buy.,This book does little to inform the reader of Hickock. If you are interested in the guns of the era then probably it is. Book arrived in a timely manner and was in good shape.
2,They are good but not origional...,"Slipknot is a fairly good heavy band,but the only thing is,those masked hicks idea of being masked was already thought up by a pretty much undergroung band called MuSHRooMHEad.Ever heard of them?I didn't think so.They have been making records since '95.They already thought up the idea of having costumes and having that many people in thier band.The hillbillies in slipknot thought they would copy thier style. So basically,Slipknot got famous off of MushroomHead's idea. Slipknot is a good band but be origional for god's sake. You should check out mushroomheadmusic.com or buy one of thier c.d.'s because they are far better than hick-knot.And Fred Durst would probobly agree with me.Well,gotta go pick up the new Limp c.d.-BYE HILLBILLIES!p.s.-please e-mail me and share your opinion about Hick-knot.My screen name is DWshiznit."
4,SlipKnoT,"This band, is probably the best band to ever hit the heavy metal scene, cory the vocalist (#8) has a great sisnging voice as in ""wait and bleed"" he can scream very good too, as in ""(sic)"" there is 9 masked men in this band. buy the CD, its a great CD to add to your collection."
4,You should have bought this cd 5 months ago...,"This album is quite nice. Throbbing guitars, talented percussionists, and great vocals. I wish I had bought this album 8 months ago when I recieved a demo from a friend. Only problem I have with the album is the last few songs drag, and it's rather short (compared to the 70 minute albums I'm used to). It does need to be clarified that this album contains NO RAP except for an intro to track 13. And really, anyone that is so stuck up about what metal ""is"" needs to loosen up. You sound far too much like the rivet heads, and we all know (or should know) what happened to industrial."
5,awesome start,"from the heart pounding of (Sic) to the amazeing sound of Scissors, this is an awesome starting c/d for the most amazeing and self owning band SLIPKNOT, with songs like, wait and bleed, surfacing, liberate, diluted, tattered and torn and no life this album is an amzeing heart pounding ass kicking metal album........stay sick f***ers"
4,VOD meets Rob Zombie in a thrash-core power house,Slipkot is the last CD you will need if you are looking for melodic noise. The sound of the cd remindes me of Vision of Disorder with the theatricks and samples of Rob Zombie. Could have lived without some of the mellow stuff in the middle of the cd but over all THE BEST IND-THRASHCORE BAND I HAVE EVER BOUGHT. GET IT AS SOON AS YOU GET YOUR PAY CHECK.
5,Slipknot: Best hardcore/metal band of 1999!,"With Ross Robinson's awesome production skills, Slipknot has turned out one of the best CD's I've ever heard. Now, I don't know what you people are on who think Corey Taylor sounds like Jon Davis, or that Slipknot sounds like Korn, but I listened to the CD just to see if the two sounded similar. They don't. Slipknot is one of the most original bands out there, at least as original as any hardcore/metal band can be. I mean, how many other bands have 2 percussionists, a guy on turntables, and a sampler, in addition to the usual 2 guitarists, bass player, drummer, and vocalist? Slipknot is a great band, buy their CD!"
3,not their best....,but doesnt really suck either.ps:all the Slipknot haters why are you even here if you dont like it? other than to make some people feel bad about their musical tastes?
5,best new REAL metal album...must own,"I bought static X like two days before I discovered Slipknot and I won't even listen to Static X!!! Slipknot is HEAVY!! It is definately not Korn nor limp bizkit!! Although I like both of those bands, this is the HEAVIEST and MOST VIOLENT CD I have ever heard. I was sorry that I WASTED my money on STATIC X teh day before but was glad that I discovered Slipknot. MUST own!!! And why does everyone have to classify all these bands as Metal or Rap...its music, and if you like it...LISTEN TO IT! by the way there isn't much rapping on this album. WAIT AND BLEED AND PURITY ARE THE BEST TRACKS BUT ALL OF THEM RULE!"
5,Slipknot's best Cd hand down,"As is a sad fact with most decent bands their first cd is the best one and the same is true for Slipknot. This is a great cd with nearly no bad songs. Whatever kind of music you would say slipknot is rapcore, metal and such this cd is the best example of it. A must own if you consider yourself a slipknot fan."
2,Nothing special,"All Slipknot sounded like to me was a 2000's version of Slayer w/a slightly alternative sound.Thrash metal is like science fiction...it's either done well or done badly.Slipknot isn't totally terrible,but they're nothing I haven't heard before. Slayer - satanic gimmick = Slipknot"
2,OVER-RATED,"You can't go anywhere without seeing 500 kids wearing Slipknot T-shirts. You can't listen to the radio without hearing about Slipknot Slipknot Slipknot. You know what? They are an OK band. They sound just like every other Calimetal band (Korn, Kittie, Coal Chamber, etc). I have their CD. Sic, Wait&Bleed, and the hidden song are the only ones I care for. The rest of the CD is pretty darn poor. The worst part is...these guys are a Sepultura RIP-OFF! I find it funny that Sepultura has been making this type of music for 15 years, and then Slipknot comes around at the last minute and cashes in on it. Sepultura does what Slipknot does 100 times better, and they only need 4 band members, not 9. Igor Cavalera from Sepultura can drum better than all 3 drummers from Slipknot at once! I saw Slipknot live and they were terrible. I dunno, I think these guys are very over-rated."
5,One of the best ever,I love Slipknot. My best friend played the c.d. Iowa for me one day and I loved it. I bought this c.d first though because I hadn't heard it. I loved it from the moment it first poped in my c.d. player to now as I write this review. This is my favorite Slipknot album If you like metal/hard rock buy this c.d.
3,"There sure is a lot of cussing in here for an ""edited"" CD.","This CD is okay. I was expecting more. To be precise, I expected there to be no cussing and I assumed the ""Explicit Lyrics"" thing at the top of this page was a typo. After all, there isn't any PA sticker shown on the picture of the cover, right? Well, I bought this CD and every cuss word is intact. Don't ask me why this CD is called an edited version. Maybe that is the typo. Anyway, lyrics aside, the music is pretty good. It starts off with a cool intro, kicks off with two loud metal tracks, softens up a bit for ""Wait and Bleed,"" and fires back up again with ""Surfacing."" It doesn't let up until track 7, then gets loud again for all the remaining tracks. All the musicians are talented, but the guitar riffs and bass lines are pretty uncreative for the most part. Over all, this is a good alternative metal/rap metal CD, but I wish I could find a clean version. This wasn't it."
3,my opinion on slipknot,"this is an ok cd, but there are better cd's out in this world. the best thing going for this band is the way they look in there jumpsuits and thier masks"
5,"Shocking, Disturbing, I Love It...",Streaming layers of hardcore flashing metal riffs embedded in an insane mixture of bass drum kicks and high-pitched keg pounding creates an atmosphere that is out of control; slipknot releases your deepest love and denigrating hatred. Amidst the 9 man assault you can't stop jumping. Frontman Corey Taylor's combination of screaming and eerie soliloquies is the perfect end to the perfect metal machine. The only thing more off the hook than a Slipknot album is a Slipknot concert. Use with caution...
1,A Wonderful Remembrance Of Happy Times Past,"Slipknot's art is the music of high energy automotive crashes and would best be utilized as backround noise to a hacking murder. This ""music"" helps explain the descent of society into it's most primitive and barbaric roots. The message of perversion and surrender will justify any teenagers decision to blow off personal responsibility and to abandon their future.This CD is best played on HIGH, in the Microwave, for 15 to 20 seconds. Every parent should make sure this happens."
5,SLIPKNOT AWSOME !,"You cant get enough of there music! There is no other band that can match SLIPKNOT! You cant find anyother band like this! I dont care if you like soft rock,rock, or just anything BUY THIS CD AND WATCH YOURSELF BE CHANGED TO METAL!"
1,horrible!!!!!!!,its just screaming and yelling. the instruments are good expecially the drums but the singing ruins it. horrible.
1,What a joke!,Whoever thinks this is METAL must be either really ignorant or really stupid. Don't waste your money on this garbage.
1,This is no talent.,This band tries to be too much like KoRn. Don't buy it no one in this group has talent.
5,pretend its pudding,"When the song (sic) started to play i was blown away by the intensity. i came to the conclusion when the cd was done that slipknot was my new favorite band. this cd is really brutal and intense. it is original also especially with the 2 percusionists and the drummer joey (who is extremely good). also this isnt ur average howling shouting metal singer. corey (singer) could sing regularly and scream good to. the guitarists are good too playing riff after riff. bassist has good sounds.sampler makes some crazy sounds mostly in songs:scissors, prosthetics."
2,Not great,"Okay, since people talked about this album sooooo much, i decided to get it. Well, I will say that they have talent and originality, but I still didn't like it. Too much swearing and too much screaming. And from what I've read, it's all an act. The evil they portray themselves as is nothing but coverups, like lets say, the masks? If you like fast-paced hard music or noise or whatever, than I recomend it. But if you like music with more of a melody to it, look somewhere else. I've got to admit, some of the sounds they used were pretty cool."
4,SLIPKNOT IS AWESOME!!,this cd is awesome cause of a couple things. coreys got awesome vocals. he can screem than just sing its awesome!! the drumm beats are awesome. ther are like 2or3 drummers in slipknot. i think thats cool. ther is so much beat to there songs. Its awesome!!!! the only bad thing is some uv the songs get boring but most uv them rule!!!!!!!!!just buy this cd if your a hard rock fan. i reccomend to ya!!!!!!!!
1,WOW SLIPKNOT 9 MEMBERS SO BAD,"wow slipknot, i do not own this cd but please look at the album cover, 9 members that is almost enough to hate them. Then try listening to them, Corey Taylor might have some talent but doesnt use it at all. After hearing songs as wait and bleed and spit it out this band is quite possibly the worst band out there today. Why are there 9 people! Seriously 3 drummers?!?!. Why do they wear masks?!they think there so hardcore because they of this but there not. they are simply retarted. If you want good metal out there i suggest everyone buy system of a down,both of their cds."
1,"EGG PLANT...YOU MEAN TO TELL ME YOU DONT LIKE DMX OR THE GAME,BUT YET YOU LIKE BULLSH*T LIKE THIS?","EGG PLANT WHAT A CRAB AZZ NAME...YOU WEAK,YOU SUCK,I'M NOT ONLY TELLING YOU TO STAY AWAY FROM THA RAP GAME...TRY STAYING AWAY FROM THE COMPUTER!!"
3,SLIP KNOT!,this cd is pretty good but Slip Knot isnt as heavy as i've heard if u ask me I made short work of this cd and it wasnt that great! This cd is like a pizza it doesnt last that long and its not so great but its alright
4,Backtrack,"As i said in my review for the IOWA album, i have only recently been getting into Slipknot so i thought that i had better review this album. My first contact with this album was at a friends, who plays this cd religiously everynight, so i had heard all of the songs, but the more i listened to it the better it became. My favourite tracks are Wait And Bleed, Spit It Out, No Life, Me Inside and Only One. This album is what kickdtarted this band and propelled them to dizzy heights and IOWA is what is going to keep them there for a long time to come"
5,One Of The Best Cd's Ever!,"742617000027 - 1/10 - Wierd.(sic) - 10/10 - You should hear corey and joey on this, 3rd best on this cd.Eyeless - 8/10 - Not my favorite song, but it's got a nice beat.Wait And Bleed - 9/10 - I like this song, it has some good singing in it.Surfacing - 5/10 - It's not my anthem.Spit It Out - 10/10 - This is my anthem, best on the cd. Coreys rapping is amazing.Tattered & Torn - 5/10 - Bit of a wierd song.Me Inside - 9/10 - Love the chorus to this.Liberate - 7/10 - This song is alright, but it gets borring.Prosthetics - 7/10 - Great percussion at the beginning, but don't really like melodic tracks.No Life - 10/10 - Amazing song, 4th best on the album.Diluted - 9/10 - A good song, nice lyrics.Only One - 9/10 - Good song, too short.Scissors - 4/10 - Don't really like melodic tracks.Eyeore - 10/10 - Amazing guitar on this, 2nd best track.Overall I'd rate this cd with 10/10! If you don't have it, go get it now!"
5,this cd kicks ass,This cd is one of slipknots best cds. Iowa was good also but i prefer this cd ecspecialy at parties because peole will start giant mosh pits.Slipknot rules
3,It pains me to say this!,"Please ignore my previous review of Slipknot. At the time of writing I had only listened all the way through IOWA (Which suits my review, in my opinion.), and only heard Sic off this album. Well, now I've heard more if this album I think, I really hate to say this but...Slipknot...are...o...k...THERE!!!! I said it. Happy now?"
1,A big cluttered mess of an album,"How the heck do you produce the record of a band with nine members without having it sound like a big cluttered mess? You can't, and that's exactly what this album is. Yes I do admit it must be pretty great to see this band live, few can match Slipknot intensity wise but the songs are just noise, there's too much instrumentation and it sounds terrible. The only good track here is Purity, the rest is just unlistenable. I'm a metal fan and I do know the difference between this and Limp Bizkit, and yes this is real but it sounds like the band just decides to play heavy stuff for the heck of it meaning this is just stupid tasteless track after stupid tasteless track. If you want something that'll get your head banging and that has some diversity go get some Slayer, leave this one on the shelves."
4,Slipknot cd,"A music fan from Milwaukee, WI is wrong, considering Slipknot was not the first band in metal to do this. Other bands came before Slipknot with masks and etc that was also in the metal genre. For example Mushroomhead and The Berzerker. This cd is pretty good. I wouldn't say its the best metal cd I heard, but it was pretty good in its year time frame. If you like the nu metal type of music then this cd is perfect for a person of that genre specific, but if you like heavy metal with some thought provoking lyrics then listen to Mushroomhead(which was out in 1993 and they are still playing music.)"
5,beautiful CD......,"This is a beautiful CD..... the songs ""NYC Weather Report"", ""If God Made You"", ""100 Years"", ""Dying"", ""Maybe I"", and ""One More for Love"" are very beautiful and definitely my favorites. Excellent artistry, and the music is wonderful. A very powerful and deep album.... definitely worth the $10."
4,Really great,"Great piece of equipment, especially for the price. The different amp models to choose from is a huge selling point. Love the Marshall 800, now sweet child of mine sounds great!! A great money saver and very easy to use. I am a beginner and wanna sound like the bands I hear on the radio and this does the trick. Now I can serenade my beautiful wife Karen. Oh has headphone jack too.....lol. Until I get a little better...."
3,It'll do.,"This is the 1829 Webster Dictionary. It works with SEARCH THIS BOOK. Face it, this will not be a primary reference book and the price is right. So don't be an ""abjeet"" Kindler--buy it!"
5,The best Lou Reed collection ever made!,Walk on the Wild Side is a great song even though there was only 30 seconds of it to listen to. I only wish the whole entire song was there for my listening. All the other songs that could be sampled were amazing as well. This CD will probably get me really into Lou Reed and Deep Pruple as well.
4,Excellent little booklet,"If you don't want to ""dive"" in to the works of Larkin right away, this is an economic opportunity to sample some of his charts and theology. Contains many of the same charts found in Dispensational Truth. A classic."
5,My Own Experience in Relating to this Book!,"WOW, is probably my first impression after reading this book. I could relate in so many ways to the writer's experiences...but having said that, even one who didn't grow up in the opulent luxury that this writer describes,can relate to the militaristic and unrealistic demands for perfection, while withholding any form of love and affection. This book has a ""happy"" ending, so to speak, in that this father who writes this book, having learned from what he didn't receive, has been able to transform his experiences into to being a loving, nurturing, and supportive father to his own children. In the book, Fathering From Love, the author, Jonathon Scott, shares his experiences and his tools as to how to be the best parent one can be!!! It is well worth reading!"
4,Never Giving up Hope,"This book is special not only because it tells the story of modern day miracles and the perseverance of love but because Carol is a very real and loving person. As her neice, I have been blessed by having her in my life. Hers is a simple story of the tremendous journey she underwent as a patient with GBS. The book is easy to read and will leave you feeling inspired to face each new day with heightened hope in the future."
3,He's got skills,"AZ can straight-up rap. There's no debating that. But he's gone underappreciated his entire career. This album, like ""Do or Die,"" is tight, lyrically. But it lacks that special something that oul make me buy it years after its release. AZ needs to track down DJ Premier to produce some tracks the next time around."
3,A dissapointing sophmore album,"it seems like AZ just cannot get out of Nas's shadow. The best song on his first album featured Nas, and guess what? The best song on this album....features Nas. He needs to put more work into promoting rap as an art form and less time advertising Armani suits. Save your money for the next Nas tape."
1,This Album was pure Trash. A waste of money.,"I can't believe he came up with that bull. i used to have mad love for AZ. I wasn't feeling his album at first. So I listened a few more times. It was a waste of time listening to it. For all prospective buyers, leave it on the shelf!"
4,AZ HALF-MAN HALF AMAZING,I THINK THE LYRICAL CONTENT WAS HOT YET HE SHOULD HAVE HAD BETTER BEATS. AZ IS UP THERE WITH NAS YET HE DOESN'T GET THE PROPER PUSH FROM THE LABEL . (RATHER UNIQUE ) WAS A TIGHT SONG AND AZ WILL DO FINE IF HE STAYS CONSISTENT LIKE HIS SINGLE IT'S WAR IS REAL TIGHT I ALSO WOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHERE I COULD SEND HIM OR HIS LABEL SOME OF MY OWN LYRICS! I SPIT SIMILAR TO HIS STYLE .KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK AZ!
5,I'm really feeling this one!,Az just has this kind of flow that you just cant mess with.He is one of the best cats out there.His album was just like looking into his life.He had help from some of the best out there.Which helped him out and made his album worth 5 stars.
2,It's OK,Interesting for the first two or three pages. I thought it would open up the culture of the designs and riddles more.
4,Improved edition.,"It seems that this was the standard textbook for most university opera history courses at one time (at least it was when I took the course in the early 80's). However, it seems to have fallen out of favor because those of us who read the earlier editions and are now teaching opera history courses recall the writing to be confusing, if not outright dull. In my opinion this lastest edition, written with Hermione Weigel Williams, is an improvement, and I think the book deserves a second reading. After teaching our opera history course using another text, I returned to this one because I feel it provides a better narrative: there seems to be more of an effort to relate the various movements in opera to one another. This cause and effect relationship is helpful to the student in their attempt to retain the information, and as well as understand the significance of each operatic movement. Give it another chance!"
2,Pretty Basic,"The ideas here aren't rocket science at all, really basic. The examples of CDNow, Barnes and Noble, etc. as successes are hard to believe. I'm not really sure how this was determined. Not a whole lot of insight here in my opinion. I prefer Customers.com by Seybold and Building Strong Brands by Aakers."
3,"good cases, not a lot of hands on stuff","The author offers interesting profiles of how six companies have gone online line. He highlights his take on what these companies do right and where they appear to fall short. But this isn't the type of book you'd be able to use as a guide to taking your own business online. There's not a lot here that's readily transferable to other businesses wanting to go online or to improve their current offerings. Still, as a snapshot in time, it makes for an interesting read."
5,eMarketing advice you can use,"I found ""eBrands"" to include marketing advice that would be helpful for start-ups and big companies alike. Also thought it was pretty well-written -- have read too many dry business books in my time, and this one was a nice contrast."
5,I can't reccomend this book enough,This book has been the only reason I have stayed sane through the ending of my 3 year relationship and broken engagement. I reccomend it especially to those who are hurting and need a ray of light at the end of that long dark tunnel.
4,Smirk at the Facts,"With a finely tuned wit and startling capability to gather facts, Paul Begala portrays, sometimes with wit, sometimes to the astonishment of the reader, how a man used his family's name, father's connections, and affability to ""fail upwards."" Succinct in prose and sharp in comment, Mr. Begala portrays ""Poppy's boy"" as a man trying---successfully---to emulate his father and rise to the top without having to work for it. While clearly biased, Mr. Begala manages to write a witty book that will make each reader smirk at Dubya, laugh at his antics and beliefs, and shudder with sheer fear at some of George W.'s views, practices, and ""thoughts."" It is a book that should be read at face value, for each fact is clearly footnoted and referenced, thus making it a plausible and frightening read. Kudos to Mr. Begala."
3,Unnecessarily cruel,"Even though I am an avid Democrat and a Gore supporter, I found the book to be too vicious--although I admit I laughed all the way through it.Begala confuses inarticulateness with stupidity, a lack of academic success with a lack of intelligence.Still, his evaluation of Bush's claims about educational reforms is useful, as is his examination of Bush's gun control policies and (heaven help us all) ideas on foreign policy.Begala should have been content to discuss Bush's policies and lack of experience--which speak for themselves--while leaving W.'s personality out of it."
2,The facts should have spoken for themselves,"Unfortunately Paul Begala felt the need embellish terrifically damning facts regarding George W's business dealings, politics, and personal history with snarky comments and childish personal attacks. He assures us in the introduction this will not be a piece to round up support for Gore as he's perfectly capable of making his own case. Yet throughout the book, Begala holds up Mr. Gore as a paragon in both politics and intelligence. Made me kinda think of a one-sided internet flame war.I am a registered Democrat and couldn't abide by George W. before picking up this book. I was hoping to gain some insight into the workings of his mind in order to discuss his candidacy with certain misguided friends and family members ;) But this book was a disappointment and an insult to the reader. Shame on you Mr. Begala; you should have let the facts stand alone rather than trying to tell me what to think!"
2,"Funny, but obviously biased","Believe me, I'm not a supporter of bush's history or actions in the white house. I picked up this book to learn a little about the man, and honestly, it's a little hard to get an objective opinion with this book. An entire novel could be written about any human being, and depending on the facts, it could either be entirely positive or entirely negative.The book was written before the 2000 election, and it even goes so far to describe a Gore asset after describing a place where Bush fails to meet the bar.It's got the facts in there, but its hard to know how to take them. This book is also already outdated at just 2 years old; it would have made a better infomercial or magazine article."
4,wish it were on dvd,Ive been looking for this forever! I just couldnt remember the name (which made it way harder to find) :). I would love to buy this on dvd.
1,Architecture??,"This book was a great disappointment. The title is especially misleading. The figures in the book just happen to be architectural drawings, but could have been anything. If you are interested in Architectural drafting using AutoCad, look for another book. If this book had been titled correctly I would have given it 2 stars. No meat!"
3,It Works well.....,"Got this for a replacement in my dads Jeep, he wanted an exact fit and didnt want an upgrade.. This fit perfect and works well with the stock system."
5,Massive!,"I continue to wait for MA's next album with baited breath. Mezzanine is arguably their best, even though it is quite different from previous offerings. All the tracks meld into each other and it is possible to get lost in this feast and not even notice the time slip by. When its over you just want more! Teardrop is a song that will haunt the recesses of your mind and could be described as alien in its form. One of the best albums of the nineties (Moby's Play in close contention). Buy it before Y2K in case the electricity stops flowin'!"
4,Refreshing Alternative,The task of finding good new music is a difficult one. Massive Attack is producing a very nice alternative to pop mainstream music. Mezzaninie continues their blend of electronic soul dub style that was evident on their previous releases Blue Lines & Protection.The nice thing about Mezzanine is they have pretty much abandoned the tired hip hop influence for a more mature sound. It's not anything groundbreaking it's just fine moody music that gives those in search of more creative artists a bit of hope.Massive Atack hasn't spawned a crop of imitators yet but maybe their limited success will wake some folks up and we can look forward to a new alternative wave. It ain't here yet.
2,disappointment from Protection,"Aside from the stellar single Teardrop, the absolute gem of this collection, Mezzanine falls short of the dynamism that was a hallmark of their previous two albums. I am confused as to how others see Protection as a low point of their first three albums. My conviction is that Mezzanine is certainly the ""weakest link."""
2,Teardrop is the strength,"Teardrop, with the mesmerizing vocals of Liz Fraser, is the standout track - unfortunately the rest doesn't quite measure up. Don't get me wrong - Mezzanine is a very ""listenable"" album, something that works well playing in the background at night (some tracks work especially well for seductive exploits). It's just that the rest of this album sounds like second-rate Portishead."
1,Awful music,"If this is the future of pop music, the music industry needs to start searching for some new artists. This boring, dull music would be great if one is in the midst of a massive depression, near the point of suicide, or just looking to scare your friends. If this isn't you, don't buy this CD."
5,"Massive Attack's ""Mezzanine"" is a masterpiece...","a perfect album blending subtle and dark hip-hop, jazz, gothic dub(they sampled The Cure in one song) and spooky ambience with a hint of industrial lethargia. this album will NEVER go out of style. it will never cease to have integrity. it is incorruptable.""Teardrop"" has got to be one of the most beautiful pieces of music ever composed in the 20th century...lyrically and musically. it feels so organic, yet has that stark eletronic sterility which adds to the darkness of it.highly sensual...totally thug...GET IT NOW!"
5,Best of Massive Attack,"This is a work of pure art. Mezzanine is PERFECT and that is rare to say, but this album has no flaws what so ever. Every single track is absolutely alluring and it will take you on an emotional journey. It's sensual and sophisticated; the beats and vocals are perfectly structured and arranged. Music cannot get any better than this."
5,Best Massive Attack Album,"I have all of Massive Attack's albums (including 100th Window), but this is far and away their best, and in my top ten albums of the 90's. Don't think -- just buy it."
3,Good beats - but new voices PLEASE!,"I'm a really big alternative music fan, however, I still like trip-hop a lot. I think that ""Portishead"" is the best in this genre - although this album does have some good songs. I have one MAJOR complaint though - and that is - I don't think that the voices fit the songs well very much. Whoever sings on ""Man Next Door"" has the most ANNOYING VOICE; He echoes on every thing he says and it is so stupid. The voice on ""Inertia Creeps"" and ""Risingson"" is also annoying (not as much) and I really can't enjoy the music if the voices aren't very good. The album is nicely crafted though and I really like the artwork. Songs like ""Dissolved Girl"" (the COOLEST BASSLINE) completely save this album. Massive Attach fans will be pleased though... People like me, however, will think that this is well... okay. Rating: B-"
4,Nice low bass,"Didn't know this group from Adam. Bought it for just the low bass to test out my speakers and new subwoofer. Has some catchy tunes, not a bad CD."
5,Outstanding,"One of the best groups of the nineties are Bristol(UK)-based Massive Attack. This is their third album and is markedly different from their previous two. Personally, I also find it the best of the three.Guitars, and bass (lots of it!) make a strong appearance in this CD. The stand-out tracks are Angel (used in Guy Ritchie's ""Snatch""), Dissolved Girl and Tear Drop. But really, the entire album is brilliant. It sort of evolves as the album goes on, exploring the same bassy feel in new ways. Every time you listen to it, you will suddenly notice little nuances that you have missed before, and the song gains greater depth. I constantly marvel at these guys for coming up with such layered music.The best way to listen to this album is to turn out the lights and crank up the bass. In these conditions, the album reveals another layer of depth. As one reviewer wrote, ""it will mess with your mind."""
4,I like it!,"Eileen bought this CD. Now I like it too. My favourite track is track 7, ""Man Next Door"". Eileen's is track 6, ""Dissolved Girl"". Maybe you will like it too."
5,BUY THIS!,"This CD is off the hook! Especially the track ""Still Po Pimpin'. This is a must get. You'll regret not buying it."
3,Average. Too much R&B.,"Kinda funny all you people goin back and forth about Bone and Do or Die cuz MVP - CLOUT (Monster Klick) started it all. CLOUT, if you can find it, will make you forget most of what you know about Bone and Do or Die.Lil Sum Sum best song. Nobody's Home (and the other tracks like it got too much R&B). Bone Diss is funny though.MOSS POINT!"
3,A demanding work,"This edition of ""Tales of the Hasidim"" comprises two volumes of Martin Buber's original work; the first one dedicated to the early masters and the second one to the later masters. It is incredible extensive and exhaustive (there are over 600 tales). No wonder it took the author 40 years to gather all the tales! Buber states on the introduction to this work that the tales included only represents one-tenth of the material in existence! This collection of tales is certainly an interesting source of inspiration for the readers who are embedded in Hassidism or might be a valuable source of information for those who wish to do research on this area; otherwise, the reader will most probably not be able to cope with the magnitude of this worl. Give some thought to it before making a decision."
4,Great movie. Terrible transfer to DVD.,One of Guiness's best. The transfer to DVD is very bad. Not worth buying until they get it right.
3,zinsco replacement,"if you own a zinsco electrical box and can't afford to replace your ticking time bomb you are stuck buying these replacement breakers. they're made with minimal quality control straight out of the shipping container from you know where. I have returned 2 out of 7 purchased because they wouldn't flip on/off properly.thanks amazon for the great exchange policy. i hope they will actually trip at the correct current.be aware of the aluminum buss bar, the old breaker could have welded itself and you wont be able to remove it safely or easily. don't open that electrical panel if you don't know what your doing."
5,great,"Very helpful inn doing research and papers for school, and in just plain being informed for everyday life and teeaching."
2,Don't Start With This One,"I'm not too familiar with this author, but I have read one of her other books and it wasn't horrible. I believe it was 'Living Single.' It was a take off of Sex in the City as far as I can tell. Too close to Sex in the City, but they're fun right. This novel is actually a little scary. The main character is so flat, so uptight, that the reader has a hard time relating to her. The opinions about life and social interactions make the character a nightmare to read and relate to. I've never given a bad review before, but being the type of person that once starts a book and has to finish, I felt that it would be an injustice to force this one on someone else. Chamberlin has every aspect of being an okay writer, but maybe she put too much of herself in this one, the character is too much like that friend that you tolerate, but only because you want to borrow her shoes."
4,Editing Help!,"I actually really like this book. It is a fun, light read. However, I can't believe all of the typos...By page 80, I counted five! I know people make mistakes, but I have never read a book with so many typos in it. It almost took away from the plot."
2,Not getting it,"I've been into alternative music for as long as I could buy records... which is a long time! I just don't see the appeal of Modest Mouse. I can accept challenging music but this stuff is just annoying. I thought maybe the addition of Johnny Marr would give these guys a listenable sound...wrong! It's simply not enjoyable music. And I don't mean upbeat and happy. I just mean it's like going to a nice restaurant and having some annoying little kid screaming through your entire dinner. Fortunately, I didn't pay for this meal and I'm gonna smack that kid on my way out!"
3,I just don't get it....,"What's with all the hype?I guess this is one of those bands you either like, or don't. And Johnny Marr is a member??...I just don't get it...I suppose if you can get past the boisterous vocals, the production is pretty good....and I DO like other bands that the MM guy produced, such as the Shins (oh man, I love the Shins!!).Little Motel is awesome tho, I love that song!I have ""Good News for People Who Like Bad News"" also...and I don't get that nither. (the title is cool tho)."
1,Sammy Hagar did it to Van Halen,"I hate this album, which is sad, because I love this band. What happened? Why MM? Why?"
5,Great,This is one of the best albums i've ever heard. I love Modest Mouse and this is easily their greatest album. You can't choose a favorite song on this CD because every one is amazing in it's own way.
3,"Drawing a Blank, sadly it's too good",Good News For People Who Love Bad News kept the off beat flavor but still wasn't in the league of This Is A Long Drive For Someone With Nothing To Think About or other passed golden successes. The new CD contains less ranting of a soul in unison with instrumental riffs that destroyed what music had ever been. The same lyrical genius still remains but that catchy little beat almost sounds like it could be thrown into a cheerleading remix. It tip toes around the trademark guitar distortion and each instrument is dumped down the public production throat and comes out a tight little music turd. We Were Dead Before the Ship Even Sank is good but it's just not the same. It's sad to hear the anticipated album being thrown at the public and yet it is so well produced that it just misses.
2,Who is this band and what have they done with Modest Mouse?,"Modest Mouse are reported to be living somewhere inside this album. I, however, cannot find them. This is the first music they have released that is completely forgettable. It comes out of the speakers, into your ears and then disappears. All of the previous MM releases, and I've heard, loved and lived them all, are unique, enduring and beloved pieces of music; this record is not of that ilk. And that's a real shame, MM are one of the finest bands of the past 10 or 15 years, right up there with the likes of Ween, Built to Spill and all of the Jagjaguwar bands. Oh well, a rare miss. I'm still a huge fan, still gonna go see them whenever the tour rolls around (definately go see them live, when Isaac isn't too drunk, the shows can be legendary), still gonna love the freak rock phenomena that is Modest Mouse, just can't seem to get behind this release."
3,not like the old stuff,"If you love Lonesome, Moon, and Long Drive, you probably won't like this. It's cheezy and poppy. I probably won't listen to it much."
1,This book is a waste of money & time!,"We had a copy of this book and took it with us to the Strawberry Lodge last week.What a mistake. Just go ahead and write 'sucker' on your forehead and get it over with.First off, the author has changed information about the climbs, not to mention re-named some. This made the long-time locals of the area really mad and we found out how much.We had the book at the Lodges' bar, and did we hear about the author and his dubious ways of earning a living.After hanging out in the area for a few days, we got all of the beta we needed about the local routes.I would not recommend this book to anybody. The only people who do, are friends of the author, so I don't expect unbias opinions from them."
2,I finished reading it just to see if it improves at the end,"The character is a lame fellow who decides to marry a woman he dislikes because he fells in love with her sister. All the pages of the novel are washed away describing inconsequential conducts and behaviors. I fail to see anything funny or at least an issue worth discussing with a friend, let alone explain to him/her what the book is about. Its theme is actually about nothing. Indeed my feelings for this book contradicts the enthusiastic reviews offered by other fellows, and I am surprised because some books which I have bought from Amazon.com based on the popular opinion have not disappointed me. Well, I guess there is always an exception to a rule."
5,in praise of a great novel that holds up with each read.,"rarely has an author shown as much insight into a mans journey through life as italo svevo. what rang true allmost a century ago resonates today in us all. zeno was a somewhat less than perfect,but honest ""everyman"", whose thoughts,intelligent, funny, and a little pathetic,make up one of the best works of fiction you will ever come across. roll over joyce!!!"
1,Fading glasses,"I bought the set in the penguin pattern, including these coolers.I loved the size they were great. The pattern faded completly away aftera couple of washings in the dishwasher. It wasn't noted they could not bewashed like that. I was totally disappointed and won't purchase them again. (Love the dishes, not the glasses)"
1,Awful!,I got the swimming goggles to use for swimming it was cute but when I entered the pool with the googles underwater water went into the goggles so I tried again and there was still water in the goggles! Unbelieveable I bought this to swim for the pool in the summer then next month I was going to a waterpark guess I wasted my money!
3,Three stars because ... who knows?,Message to the music industry: This CD showed up in my Gold Box and I was considering it. But it's copy-protected. I do not purchase copy-protected products. Real shame ... I may have liked it and you may have made some money.
2,Dissapointing,"I rented this purely for Catherine Zeta-Jones, and was dissapointed. The story is dull and depressing, with no redeeming qualities, bosting immorality (on both main characters' parts) and dryness. The guy does eventually get over his father's cruelty, but it doesn't change him for the better, while his wife sleeps with every soldier to come along. Overdrawn, and more of a guy's film than a girl's, with all the war sequences. Also, more than one character gets away with murder."
3,not super inspiring but still worthy of a roll in the carpet,"OK, bad puns aside, this is totally '60s farfisa organ type psychedelic pop with the crunchy guitars. It may not be the Three O'Clock but all these tunes will have you bopping. The thing I don't get is it has been listed as low as $1.39 and yet no one bought it. At even $10, it's far better than a lot of stuff out there. Give them a listen."
5,this book is ABSOLUTELY OUTSTANDING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This book is perfect for even lazy people like me. It ranks the people based on a point system and it gives one phrase summaries and 2 paragraph summaries. you can learn a helluva lot in 5 minutes. excellent for people of all ages. Also, the authors have an EXCELLENT SENSE OF HUMOR. You should definitely buy this book!!!"
2,Irritating,"I have nothing against the choices that the authors made, even if I disagree with some of them. But after the first 100 or so entries, I became very tired with the superior attitude and snide tone of the authors."
2,not as good as it could be,I liked his other housing boom book much better. This one is not as good and too opinionated. What a shame...
4,Love Sick,"This memoir is an excellent example of writing. The prose is lyrical, compelling and the description carries meaning. As a reader you will be entertained and informed. You don't need to be an addict to appreciate the story--I'm not, and I did."
2,What was the point?,"I read lots of books on addiction and recovery.All I kept thinking about when reading this book was - what the heck was the point of writing this book? In most cases, these types of memoirs are usually written as part of the recovery - however, this book read more like a manifesto of all the men this person has gone through.There is no warmth, no explanations, no sympathy and NO honest attempt at recovery or even of really finding out what is happening to this woman.Also, this book is sooooo slow - every once in a while, an intersting tidbit, then back to boring again.The only saving grace is a look at the 12 steps.Skip this one."
2,Not very pleased..,"It's a horrible fabric texture, similar to a shower curtain. Very flat and slides all over the floor when my puppy lays on it."
1,don't works,"The DVD don't works and I'l try in several equipments, include in my PC, without success. The DVD run but the image don't appear to be. I'd like to receive another DVD, but if you can test it, I think better, I'l apreciate."
4,Another Hot Book from Down Under,"Chantal Goodwin is all business. Cameron Quade has left business behind along with a too-dedicated-to-the-job fiancee. Can he find happiness with another woman bent on climbing the corporate ladder? Or can he persuade her to stop and smell the roses and maybe accept the love he has to offer? Quade is a quick and easy read and is hard to put down. It is such a fun book with lots of clever dialogue and sexy banter and innuendo. I loved the opening scene with the black satin sheets and Chantal's comment to her sister's answering machine. I just adore a good ""awwwwwww"" ending and this story had it in spades."
1,Seriously?,"I saw the other reviews for this and couldn't believe it. Can you say spin doctors?. Worst movie ever starring Burt Reynolds. Burt appears to be very drunk throughout the fist 80% of the film. Lots of awkward moments, bad acting. I felt sorry for Reba McEntire, she appears embarrassed in several scenes. Watch the mouth-to-mouth resuscitation scene carefully....creepy."
4,extremely--I-don't-know-what,"This novel was originally presented as an autobiographical novel, but certain elements do not seem true to life.--The hero falls in love at first sight, and the two continue to remember each other until the bitter end.--The heroine arouses the passion of 6 men through no effort on her own part.--The hero and heroine live an irresponsible lifestyle without ever putting in a single day of hard work, yet their friends continue to support them without a word of complaint.--The hero and heroine escape to a sandy wasteland within hiking distance of New Orleans. The novelist could never have been there because there is no such place.This novel aroused operatic settings by 3 composers.How, I don't know.It's not the translator's fault. She provides a helpful introduction and helpful footnotes."
4,"Not the best, but very good.","I enjoyed this DVD, as I do all the Gaither music DVDs. It wasn't the best they have done, but it was well worth the price."
5,Wonderful DVD,"The gospel music keeps you uplifted and makes you understand how important music is. The Homecoming DVD's are my favorite ones to watch. The singers are amazing, voices like you angels."
2,The Legends are Gone,"Bill Gaither continues to milk the Southern Gospel music cow, but the milk is getting thin and New Age Christian. No more Jake Hess, Happy Goodmans, Hovie Lister or George Younce."
3,Wrong expectations,"While the background for this book inolved membership of the Jehovah's Witnesses, I was expecting for there to be more of a focus and insight into that religion. The book was good nonetheless, but was not what I was expecting. If you are after a book where the author talks about overcoming hardships in general, then this is a good book. However, if you are wanting to gain a more indepth insight into the JWs religion, this may not be the best book for you."
5,A MOTHER,"Brenda is a very strong willed person , because that is what it takes to to pull yourself out of an ocult ! everyone that has children should read this book so you can protect them from Jehovah Witness . they seek out week and needy people weather they are young or old . i know of what this girl wrote is true . it is hard to beleive that a mother could stand back and watch their child go hungry , but it is true . just like Brenda says . educate yourself people , they go after the week minded . i wish i would have had this book 20 years ago , i could have saved my daughter from her heart ache . thank God she broke away like Brenda did , but my daughter had our help , Brenda did not . they brain wash you !!!!"
2,Misleading,"I ordered this book anticipating a story of someone freeing themselves from a cult as the cover suggests. I guess you can't judge a book by its cover. The first six chapter are from age ten (intro. to JW's) to age eighteen (freedom). After that it is Brenda's life story, with the watchtower popping up every now and then. I have read many books regarding the watchtower, and have personally dealt with JWs. I was bored with the rut the book got into as she told her life story and forgot that her book was about leaving a cult. At times it seemed if anything bad happened it was the watchtowers fault (normal sruggles in life). Many things she went through lots of kids go through when they decide to leave their parents home. Some of the hardships she endured she put on herself. At one point I forgot that the book was about leaving a cult and listened to her complaints about struggles many Americans go through on a regular basis."
4,Excellent but need something else,This kit is excellent but it would be so nice if it had a lens adapter included. It was advertised to work with the Z650 and Z740 but the lens does not fit any of those cameras without a lens adapter.
4,It left me almost speechless.,"If the information present in this book is all true and accurately framed, I'm horrified. I am not implying that I am challenging the validity of the information. In fact, I have seen hints of some of this in other sources. Some of this left me almost speechless (I don't think I'm ever completely speechless). I don't doubt, that if this book were read by every person in this country, there would be massive changes demanded in many areas. I hope this book galvanizes enough people to begin the process of those changes. SUMMARY: Horrifying - and a must read for every citizen."
2,Doesn't compare to Boyz N the Hood,"Menace 2 Society may contain more realism compared to Boyz N the hood, but the film itself will never be as good as John Singleton's movie. Boyz N the Hood is the yardstick that all other gangsta films have unsuccessfully tried to follow."
5,Thought this movie was great,"This movie is an awesome movie about living in the ""Hood"". It tells you how life is there and what it is like growing up in the hood. I think it is also ok for younger audiances and would tell them to watch it because it teaches a great moral. To find out what it is you are going to have to watch this movie. Review By: Crone Comments Questions: Email me at, Crone31@aol.com"
4,Brutally Honest Film!,"This brilliant, realistic, insightful and tough film is a painful look into the black ghettos of Los Angeles. Very naturally acted, and with realistic situations, lots of guns, profanity and violence, but that is the harsh reality that some people have to face. There are no heroes and enemies in this movie, it's just a look into the lives of desperate people who are deep down looking for a way out. Great film. Also see the similarly themed 'Boyz N The Hood'. Extras: watch for Samuel L. Jackson in a small role. From a scale of 1-10 I give this movie an 8!"
2,Not really a director's cut...,"I haven't read reviews from other people so I don't exactly know what (if any) extra material is included in the ""Director's Cut"" bu I really didn't see very much. I'm extremely disappointed. One of my favorite movies but I wanted to see some additional footage."
4,A Smoother Old Spice,"This cologne smells like a smoother old spice. I quite enjoy it but the bottle is quite small for the price, so not sure I will get again. Depends on how much I use and how much I like it."
3,Smells like old spice,I think the cologne smells just like old spice. It has a musk smell to it. I love the deodorant they make but this is just ok.
5,An understated and underappreciated GEM!,"This is one of those movies you hear nothing about, gamble your matinee money on, and come away from raving about it. Ellen Burstyn is wonderful as a woman who comes back from a near- death experience, goes back to her roots, and becomes a reluctant ""faith healer"". Playwright Sam Shepard gives a powerful performance as a disciple/lover of Burstyn's, who can't reconcile his feelings for her and her ""power"" with his Bible-belt roots."
5,Great Great Movie! Great Experience!,"Was thrilled to see this on DVD & paid a lot for it because its worth it! Ellen Burstyn is as unforgettable in this role as she is in Cuckoo's Nest! Saw this years ago on television & never forgot it! A thought-provoking story with an unexpected plot. Sam Shepard was sooooo young & kind of hot back then but was a stellar actor even then! Like the movie Castaway, this is not just a movie--it's a life experience!"
2,Not a great copy,This is an old movie but not a great copy. There were several times the movie froze and I had to press fast forward. Aside from that problem - it's a wonderful movie.
4,A must read for parents & teachers,"This book explains how to deal with kids. Some of the tips and suggestions given in this book can not only be used for kids, but also for adults. It teaches you how to motivate kids and make a positive re-enforcement. There were several interesting situations given as examples. I would recommend this book for all parents & teachers."
2,Obvious ideas,"I had to read this book because of a teacher's request, for a topic at the university. She came to the classroom with this book, as if it were the ultimate guide on teaching - well, she obviously liked it, but not everybody has to agree with the ""ideas"" there. The things the authors wrote are so obvious, at least for some persons, that all I can say is that I really had a very good time reading it as a comic book, nothing else. I laughed very much with all the explanations a teacher gave to a 7 or 9 year-old pupil, because he touched her on the arm. It was a lecture, not a simple explanation! Clearly we have to be polite, encouraging and nice towards the students. But this book really exagerated some points in such a foolish way, that I could only laugh.Maybe it's good for people who are starting a teaching career - then I would say read it, but even though I would be very cautious."
3,Disappointing Read,"This book has some great ideas and some very good suggestions on how to speak to children. The most important point made in the book is that children need to be heard and adults need to acknowledge children's feelings. While the main idea of this book is great, the bulk of the information is anecdotal and not based on any research or data. The format is quite annoying because it's written like a story, complete with (pretend) conversations printed. I felt as though the authors were talking down to their readers. This completely unremarkable book might have made a great article, but as a book it's very average. I skimmed over most of the annoying ""conversations"" between pretend characters and tried to focus on the main ideas. If you want a very simplified explanation on how best to talk to you kids or students, this book is for you. If you're looking for something with a little more substance, I suggest you look elsewhere."
3,Old software included,"The drives works fine and is plenty of room, but the backup software included is too old and support website is not helpful at all."
4,Its great if your spouse is shy,"These coupons are a nice way to probe your spouse in more romantic ventures than he/(normally she) indulges in. Some times our partners want to do some of the romantic stuff, but are hesitant, shy or restricted in imagination. I think these wonderful, simple coupons can go a long way in situations like these."
2,Had Potential - But...,"I had eagerly awaiting the arrival of this paperback. The synopsis sounded great and I love this genre. Unfortunately, I was extremely disappointed.The story itself is pretty good. It's romantic as well as erotic. However, this author needs to stop doing his or her own editing!!! Horrible grammatical errors abound. I'm talking basic English.I know this started out as an e-book and I've come to expect a little sloppiness in many of those. I imagine it's because they are released without as much proofing as print books. But this is beyond a few overlooked mistakes.The problem with grammatical errors is that they immediately take me out of what I'm reading. There are so many here that the CONSTANT distraction made me want to throw what would have been an enjoyable story against the wall.Please, Justus, if not an editor, at LEAST a proofreader!!"
5,A must for teenagers of all ages,"Tolerance, love, beauty, thought, spirituality, emotional intelligence, warmth, patience. Need I say more?"
3,Now I'm Sleepy,"Maybe I just wasn't in the right mood for a heavily poetic book on one man's life philosophies, but this book lost me after the chapter on children. Some sections are insightful and very well written. On death, children, and love were my favorites. I'm not sure how novel these ideas were back in 1928 (?) when the book was first published, but they are nothing new today. Still, the flowery language is pretty, it's not overly long, and also it's probably one of those books that make you look cool when your reading it at a coffee shop.... so it's not all bad.This book was given to me by my dad who grew up in the 60's and 70's. It occurs to me that The Prophet seems to speak best to those from this generation (peace, love, and all that crap... you know). Maybe it's just not relevant to me? Maybe I need to approach it at a different time? Maybe I need to smoke something herbal?"
5,The Prophet,"i ordered only one book, to be sent to my ""giftee's"" address, but was sent two books, one as a gift, and one to my residence. When I tried to stop it, it was too late, as it was already into shipping mode."
5,Universal Wisdom,"No matter where your faith or spirituality is based. ""The Prophet"" will give you a constant source of inspiration. I've been reading the book for twenty years and still find something ""new"" every time I pick it up (almost daily.)I've given my personal copies away to friends, family and strangers alike. Buy two."
2,Shame on me: I didn't read description,"I revisited web page after I received the book. I found the product description clearly states the size: ""Product Dimensions: 5.7 x 4.2 x 0.7 inches"" ~ which is halfway between a paperback and the hardcover size that I expected (8""x6"" or so). The book was useless as the gift that I intended. Worse, I didn't discover it until after my Mom received it! Not worth returning even though it was a new book."
1,Misty eyed I read on ...,"To accurately gauge the type of person who would enjoy ""The Prophet"", please read the earlier review written by a person who is obviously a fruitcake. I felt ""obliged"" to read this back in the early '70s by some misty eyed lover of spirituality. I can't even remember the gender of this seeker after spiritual truth. I know that I only read about 2 or 3 pages and prepared my ""review"" for the next time I met up with this seeker. Please, you must have something better to do with your time than read ""The Prophet"". Go do it!"
4,Recommended Book,"Hi, I have not read the book yet but it arrived on time in the condition I expected."
5,My Favorite,"This book is beautiful!! his words make sense they always have and always will. at one point it brought tears to my eyes.. Then again, i am sappy!"
5,Beautiful,"...might not agree with every idea, but the writing is hauntingly beautiful and nostalgic. Read it outdoors under a tree in the fall or spring. Read it aloud. Enjoy."
5,Phenomenal Work of Spirituality,"I had never heard of this book, this author when I received it for a birthday present.WOW!Why HAVEN'T I heard of this? Spiritually uplifting, life-centering work of beautiful genius. Everyone should read this to get a intelligent perspective and a bit of focus in their life. I highly recommend to those who are just taking a new path in life, whatever that may be.Bonus to this book is each time you go back to read it, you will find something new and wonderful!"
3,Inspirational...,"An unusual departure of an imaginary prophet ... Saying goodbye, his people gather around him asking about human nature and life!!The dialogue takes the form of questions and answers...which makes it a little monotonous...but the poetic language and the symbolic style of explanation takes your mind away and makes you wonder impatiently what the next question will be!!An inspiring revelation of truths ...""Love one another, but make not a bond of love...Even as the strings of a lute are alone though they quiver with the same music"""
2,Eloquent,"I read this about a year ago and can't recall a great deal of the book. From what I do recall it was like a poem all the way through. While the writing was beautiful, I found it ambiguous and befuddled with meaning that I could not identify with. When Gibran speaks of God, I cannot identify because I have since abandoned those philosophies. It is thus difficult to revisit them in this book. I have the feeling a may have missed something great about this book. Indeed, I pulled wisdom from parts, but rather than go back and read it again, for now, perhaps I will move on to another of the many books out there that are enlightening and worth reading. Someday, I would like to read this again and dig deeper."
2,A bit disappointed,"I picked up this book after being inspired by some quotes from Kahlil Gibran. This is a brief text written in a flowery language that masks some simple points. I did not find this book inspiring or insightful, but it was a short read."
4,"Great book, advanced reading.","I read ""The Prophet"", by Khalil Gibran for a class assignment, and I found it an amazing piece of writing, even though it was a bit difficult to follow in some instances.Gibran's insights into the proper way to live, his wisdom, and his poetic ways with words, make it unlike anything I've ever seen. Very inspirational, and thought provoking."
4,Oprah's project book,"Good book although somewhat in the mystical/etheral sense. Having read many books discussing the powers of attraction, I can appreciate the idea Mr. Tolle is trying to get us to see. It's a bit over the top in some aspects, way too deep for just the casual reader if their head isn't in the right place, which is OUT of the box...a few of my friends just couldn't grasp the jest of it all.Too bad, for there have been many AH HA moments for me along the way amongst the pages.Can't wait to hear what the class is all about!And what a great happening it would be if we all could change our world to the better?"
2,A New Earth,"This book started off great, very deep. However, I am a Christian and put the book down immediately after reading his view on creation. It was very brief and could easily be missed if you're not paying attention. I could not read on and further subject myself to evil in disguise."
5,Amazing,This book is amazing! It really helps you understand what is going on inside your head and everyone else's! And once you understand this it helps you transform yourself by transcending your ego! I read this book and then bought three copies to give to my family! An outstanding book!
3,Oprah's existential book of the year,"This book is good if you read it along with Oprah's weekly book club discussion she had on her web page. The online discussions REALLY HELP in understanding what this book is about. I personally liked some of her other selections better - this one reminded me of the kind of books I had to read in my college literature class. The book was more of a ""study"" book than a ""relax and read"" tome. This is NO light summer read!"
2,New Earth Book,"Not every book that Oprah promotes is ""great"", no offense, but this is a hard book to interpret and stick with and my time is too valuable to me to keep pushing myself to finish, just because of all the hype. I am an avid reader at age 72 but there are too many wonderful books out there waiting to be tried. I am glad that others enjoyed this book but not for me.I am too old to be delving into this sort of thing; I just want to be entertained now."
2,Nothing New,"As other reviewers have pointed out, if you're familiar with Buddhism, you're familiar with this book. I think it became popular because so many westerners don't know or have read basic books on Buddhism. I think because he was on Oprah and he's a Westerner, his book got more notice, but for me it was just slightly repackaged Buddhism."
2,formlessness in print,"Just finished the book today.Great insights, and lots of wisdom about the influence of the ego.However, I think his philosophy of ""formlessness"" has some major drawbacks, which show up most obviously in his writing style.Reading this book gave me the impression that his confidence in present-tense intuition caused him to the right the book without any thought or effort to restrain himself or organize the material--no planning whatsoever. It's great information, but it's very repetitive, not very scholarly, and uses very little specific examples to illustrate points.Also, it's all just his opinions, written in a rambling style, without any reference to authority beyond himself, the Bible, and a few buddhist quotes.This wouldn't be so bad if it was a testimonial or a personal philosophy, but it's not. It's a treatise on how the world is, and how we operate, and how the terrible ego is to blame for everything from cancer to PMS.Maybe read his other book ""power of now"" first."
4,I very interesting read,"Very interesting perspective on life. It's similar in many ways to ""The Secret"" but, a much tougher read. It will make you look at things in a whole new light."
1,Cult,"There are a few Biblical truths that have been twisted. This is diffinately a New Age book and does not glorify Christ as Savior. Carol Ledford, author of Miraculous Interventions in Life"
1,Why is Penguin pricing e-books so high?,"The ebook price is more than the paperback edition. Why? I loved buying Kindle books because it seemed like a way to support authors but cut down on my costs. Now, it's become easier to buy used books, which benefits authors and publishers not at all."
2,I must be really dim,"I have tried and tried to read this book, and just cannot get into it, get it, be inspired by it, stay with it, have an ""aha"" moment--and I have given this book more chances than I've ever given any book. I am puzzled. Maybe I'm just dim. I don't get it."
1,Tolle's Torment,"Everyone is entitled to their personal opinion; that's one of America's greatest attributes, however, we will have to fight in order to keep it. As for the book; I think it sucks. That's about as informative and entertaining as I can be on the review. Definitely ""New Age""; definitely misleading."
1,Not what I expected,The book does not really follow Bibical principles. I probably should have not purchased the book.
1,Take out the Trash,If you want pure truth and truly wish to know your purpose for being alive read the Bible and stop reading trash like this. Oprah is nothing more than a FALSE prophet that far too many people are buying into and thus sealing their ultimate fate which is eternity separated from God. Wake up people before it's too late and you find yourself standing next to Oprah in Hell.
5,"Great, but The Power Of Now is still best.","This book is a little more conversational and far-reaching, as well as more easily readable (it flows a little more like a novel) than The Power of Now.However, I like TPON better because it's more concentrated, to the point, and goes into greater depth. It's more like a text book/manual, compared to the looser ANE."
4,"Another book that is great, with more scientific approach","I've read alot of comments from different readers, and thought that folks may enjoy this following book if they are interested in spiritual enlightment from a buddhist viewpointHope you enjoy it!http://www.baus.org/baus/library/MayflowerII.pdf"
3,A Little Heavy on the Scripture Quotes,To live in a conscious manner every moment is the most powerful energy that one has going for oneself. Loved the last chapter most of all.
1,USED book sold as new! :(,"Book advertised as new, but arrived used, and with Walmart sticker (for cheaper price!). Bought as gift, very embarrassing! :( Sold by: Tara D Moliere"
1,Awful,"Nauseating New Age pablum for the porridge-brained. It was a gift from a clueless and flakey acquaintance so I tried to read it but it was just terrible. I'd have never imagined this hokum would lure so many people. I might write one of these and cash in on the trend if I didn't feel so sorry for the types who fall for this psychobabble. But someone has to take their money, I suppose . . ."
3,Resonates but rambles,"Eckhart gives a positive message and a great philosophy on how to live life. I thought half of it was padding though. I was particularly put off by the constant injection of quotes from Jesus/Buddha/whoever to ""prove"" a point yet completely ignoring or lacking any context. It gets a bit ""hippie"" but the concepts are valid."
5,Info we all need to know,"Mr. Tolle's information in this book is highly interesting. Please keep an open mind when reading this. He has so much helpful information. I just hope that to all who get to read it will become as ""enlightened"" as I hope I have become."
2,A New Earth,"For some it may help, but for me I didn't agree with what was written. But hey try it. You may like it!"
5,AWAKEN TO YOUR LIFES PURPOSE! The title says it all!!!!,"This book is a lesson for living life to the fullest. IT will change your life if you are ready for it! It shows you how to live in this moment to the fullest and be present in it and connected to God! IT goes beyond religion straight to the source of Love and Light itself! Don't be hung up on the religion guilt thing. This will take you past it and give you clarity of truth and love and true.I found it no accident that I found out about it. It has improved my family, personal, and business life in so many ways to make me more happy and extremely successful!"
2,Common Sense,"I am 1/4 finished with this book and I find my interest waning. Most of the information in this book is common sensical and dumbed down. I don't know exactly what I was hoping for, perhaps something with a human element rather than an analytical approach to psychology & spirituality. I hope it gets better, but the chances of me having the interest to finish this book are pretty slim. I tried listening to the webcast of the same title before buying the book, but it was uninteresting without having read the material."
1,Excellent,I am deployed overseas and I am amazed how fast my order got to me. I sent my order and a week later I received it. Not only did it get to me fast but it was in excellent condition. Thanks for servicing those who are so far from home.
2,Not the best!,Too flakey for solid Christian spirituality! Too much compromise of the gospel of Jesus Christ.
4,A New Earth,"This book ""in my opinion"" is for someone already thinking or actually working on their Spirituality. This book in order to get it, must be read more than one time. Very insightfull and asks you to do alot of soul searching as to the person you really are.You will need to extremely honest as to letting your ego go. This book will transform the world."
4,Solution for the Somnolent,"I ordered this by accident and was prepared to snark and sneer; however, I was pleasantly surprised that I read it in a couple of sittings and took away something of value. No, it doesn't reflect my belief system. No, it isn't particularly original. Yes, it can be viewed as popularized and diluted Eastern thought. However, as one who spends about 90% of life in her head, I need constant reminders to come to my senses (literally). Tolle does a nice of reminding me of this and gives some specific and useful tips as to how to achieve and maintain awareness.I am a bit mystified by the perception that a single, childless man may not be credible as a writer on enlightenment. So we need to hold out for the mystical musings of the Old Woman Who Lived in a Shoe?"
3,A little hard to read,"I am an avid reader and was very excited to finally get to read this well-touted book. I found his ideas solid, but nothing that has not already been brought forth in other reading. After a while, I had a hard time perceiving his picture of a ""pain body"". I would not give my pain (any of them, as I have quite a few at my age)the right to be known as a pain body. They are just part of my present body and I work around the pain. I take few pills, so I recognise each pain and put it in its place. Finally, I had to put the book down and will continue it at another time. It did not give me a ""change"". I guess I have changed over the years and see my self in a more positive, non-judgemental way. I find joy in each day and see the world around me as a gift from God."
1,garbage,"its garbage and will be returning it tomorrow! don't believe everything you read people, even though the richest woman in america endorces it."
5,Awesome,"I love this book. I am an accredited Journey Practitioner and it is very complementary to The Journey by Brandon Bays. I would recommend anyone who likes this book to read that one as well. I went to all of the seminars from the journey and the No Ego Seminar is just like this book. I find both to be very inspirational, thought provoking, calming, and grounding.In this book, the first 1 or 2 chapters are a little difficult to get through but once you are through those it is absolutely amazing."
5,A Profound Book,"I'm listing A New Earth on my website and was looking for the best place to refer people to read about it, when I came upon this Amazon listing. Those who say there are better books and intellectually pick it apart, well, that is obviously true for them, yet I've seen this book change people's lives profoundly - friends, family, even acquaintances. The book is a visceral experience of change and awakening, so I hope any hope negative posters do not discourage you as a potential reader, it is an amazing book."
5,WOW!,"This is a must read for anyone who has wondered ""What is Next for me"". I loved this book! It is a compelling book that awakens us to the possibilities of living fully.Mia RedrickAuthor,Time for mom-Me:5 Essential Strategies for A Mother's Self-Care"
2,A Bunch of Gobbledygook,"I saw this man on Oprah Winfrey trying to explain why Barack Obama went to Trinity Church to hear that racist Rev. Wright preach his propaganda about the U.S. Gov't creating the AIDS virus to kill black people, along with saying G-D America, we brought 9/11 on ourselves. He gave some mumbo-jumbo answer that it was basically because of America's ""collective pain"". What a bunch of malarky. Obama went to that church to get himself some ""street cred"". Also, his wife agrees with the pastor, read her thesis yourself it's posted on the net. Oprah is pushing her agenda on America, just like others are trying to do and it is not going to work. Do not bother reading this book, it's a bunch of malarky. Save your money. Also, what are this man's credentials, does he have any?? Tolle is nothing more than Oprah's new tool if you ask me."
2,Why?????????????,Why do we think a book will help us through life? Its a good book though. I loved the book Mr Instability though it had me laughing so loud I thought I was going to tear something! and it was helpful in its hiddin meanings.
3,A New Earth...only okay.,"A New Earth is only okay in my book. I am a Christian and it unfortunately doesn't take that much into account. In fact, at times, I felt as if it were discounting my belief system. On the positive, the one thing I really value about the book is the premise of living in the present moment. It really hit home with me that I often think too much about the past or often anticipate the future constantly. Then where is the present? Gone...never to appear again. So this is a valuable thing to get out of any reading."
2,Easier,"It seems to me that it's easier for people to call sin, EGO, rather than what it is ..sin ~ you know stuff like selfishness, self centeredness etc. which is the cause of all sorts of horrible stuff going on in the world, that stuff has always been referred to as sin for as long as I know, but Mr. Tolle calls it EGO and everyone goes AH HA..Oh...that must be what it is...so, now can I ask what do we do with all this EGO we just realized that we had/have....pretend like we didn't know any better or just trudge forward with all the guilt of how we've behaved and believed??? I think this book comes up short in the end."
5,Life Changing,"This book is for those who are seeking to evolve in their spiritual journey. As the book says, your spiritual journey doesn't affect your belief system. For me it increases my faith. I recommend this book to anyone who is looking to develop a deep awareness of themselves."
5,"Refreshing, with an important message!",Another great book that the world needs from Eckhart!Highly recommended!You might also like:The Power of Now: A Guide to Spiritual Enlightenment
4,It Would Be Hard For Anyone Not To Find Some Value In This Book,"That said, I find the author disingenuous and rather pompous. If anyone can believe that Tolle is fully conscious and egoless, I'd be shocked. Whether he is or isn't is irrelevant to the messages he conveys.Yes, were I to think of myself as spiritually evolved, spending a week with my parents would promptly eliminate that self delusion.Read Ekhart's irrefutable proof of reincarnation. It's laughable.Yet there is wisdom in his constant rehashing of how we get lost in the dramas of our lives. Guilty!I wish Tolle had a better editor. You might take note that there were no acknowledgments in his book, so I was wondering if he even had an editor."
1,Waste of Time,"Bunnyrabbit4 couldn't have said it better. This was a rambling mess. I would have stopped reading it after 80 pages, but I was just waiting to see what all the fuss was about and hoping he would make a solid case."
2,A NEW EARTH,"It wasn't that great, wasn't all that it was crack up to be, if you are a believer in the bible when it is about the same. I wasn't that impressed."
2,Overrated!,"Since I had read Tolle 10 or 15 years ago, I thought I would try this volume with all its hype. It is a major disappointment and virtually unreadable. When I read Tolle before I considered his writings with those of Martin Buber. This book is a big nothing and I simply cannot understand its credibility as a ""spiritual"" book, unless there are a lot of over age 50 women who have never read a meaningful philosophical or spiritual work before in their lives.And, yes, I am over 50, but at least I have read Kant, Buber, the Koran, the Bible, etc. I guess this book is pop thought for this year."
1,A New Earth: Awakening to Your Life's Purpose,"Valuable information but NEW AGE MATERIAL in my opinion...so readers, particularly Christians, if you are really searching for purpose from the Christian perspective, without the influences of other nonChristian faiths, try reading, THE PURPOSE DRIVEN LIFE by Rick Warren.The Purpose Driven Life: What on Earth Am I Here For? (Purpose Driven Life, The)That book along with the HOLY BIBLE did it for me."
1,Disappointed,I was very disappointed that I did not receive the book in a timely manner. I was told a week after I ordered that they did not have it in stock as they thought they did and I could cancel if I did not want to wait for it. I then tried to cancel and was told it had been shipped. I had to wait 2 weeks before getting it and was very frustrated.
3,good gay euro-disco musique,"Very memorable Italien-made house from about the time house music just started. Now house music finds its way into minivan commercials and supermarkets, but around 1989 this was actually considered ""progressive"" upon initial release, as was house music in general. Very vocal based in its direction, these tunes should be pretty memorable and some of these now count as wedding-reception standards (""Strike It Up"" and ""Everybody, Everybody""). I remember something about the girl on the cover of all the 12""s and the LP was not actually the singer. Just posed as the singer. There was some scandal, and I think they lifted a lot of the samples from original recordings of Loleatta Halloway on SalSoul recordings. Hmmm. It all seemed so important then...not anymore though."
1,"Great, if you have a normal size head.","This is a really nice hat. I was looking foward to getting it. My head is apparently abnormally small, because I can't find any hats that fit. This was a ""small"" I guess I'm an extra small. :("
5,An Interesting Book,"I thought it was really good and I understood it. Mahiru Shiraishi is always thought of as a good luck charm, except to herself, she has the worst luck even her parents died in a car crash. Somehow everyone she touches she transfers her luck to them, leaving her with none. She then meets the Lunar Race who needs her as the descendant of the princess. She is able to invoke in them their full moon form as a bat, vampire, fox, and werewolf, even when it is not a full moon, just by touching them. A group of detectives are after the Lunar Race because the Lunar Race is after the tear drops of the moon, which were taken from them so they steal them back. The detectives simply think they are theives and are chasing them. One of the demons of the lunar race hates and is scared of Mahiru she has to decide whether she will help them or not.I really enjoyed this book and have read it five times in the last two days, sad huh? anyway, it's a good book if you like fantasy"
2,It does the job,"Its a functional night stand, and is worth the price. It looks like a cheap night stand because it is a cheap night stand."
1,Poor quality,"I was very disappointed in the quality of this table. The right hardware was not sent with the table. It was definitely not easy to assemble even after they sent the ''correct"" hardware. The screws still don't fit properly. I don't recommend."
3,OK -- That's all,"The night stand is OK. It took about 30 minutes to put it together. It looks very nice but it isn't sturdy. It will rock from side to side which was disappointing. But for the sale price, and the fact that only an adult will use it, it's ""OK."" I wanted to tell people that I would not put this in a small child's room.I actually bought this same item several years ago here on Amazon for $29. My college aged daughter used it and was happy with it. I never saw it and do not know if hers rocked as well. It may be a different item altogether these days. Who knows?"
4,"Great stand, needs better alignment of holes for screws","Solid wood stand is much nicer than you would expect for price. Solid when put together, though in 2 cases the holes for the screws didn't line up well - finally got it aligned. Instructions are fine. Some small dings in finish on sides but given where I will place it, not an issue. Would definitely buy again. Someone else commented on the quality of the drawer bottom, but I thought it was fine."
5,Just as i expected,My book arrived in greater conditions than i expected. i'm so glad i bought off of sithinstructor. thank you so much!!
4,Siberian Huskies for Dummies,This book has a lot of good information in it. It made me laugh out loud a couple times how it hit the mark on some of the things my dog does!
2,Better version available,"Penn has some relevant things to say, but unfortunately this version (Applewood) is in the original language -- that is, it's 300 years old. If you want something more readable (and understandable), check out a recently published edition by Herald Press (ISBN: 0836192052, March 2003; Eric Taylor, Editor). Taylor has done a great job of modernized the text without dumbing it down. There's a great historical introduction, a bunch of endnotes, and More Fruits of Solitude which the Applewood version does not include. For my money, the Taylor version is the better choice."
4,Hallucinogenic light show with no drugs.,I bought 3 of these. 2 work and 1 doesn't. The light show is fantastic and really a conversation starter. I have had no trouble at all with the 2 that work.
2,Works fine - when it works.,"Bought this product about 6-8 months ago. Within about 1 month I had my first experience where it wasn't working for one particular port. I have found it ""hiccup"" a couple of times since then where the port I'm using doesn't work.It works fine when it works, but I want something to work 100% of time and not have to worry about it possibly not working. This works about 90% of time, but is quite frustrating if you want to do something quickly and its acting flaky that day."
1,Flashing piece of junk....,"This is an absolute piece of junk.Most items I plug into won't work. I don't beleive it is supplying the correct power they need to work.... with OR without the supplied AC adapter connected.The lights don't even do anything meaningful. I had figured (before I bought it) that the LED's would correspond to each connection.... they don't! They just blink randomly. My three year old loved it! They got so annoying that I had to cover the whole darn thing with electrical tape so I wouldn't have to see them anymore!I finally gave up on it and it is now in my three year old's room as entertainment. He likes to turn the light out and watch it flash random colors on the walls of his room.So, in conclusion... don't buy this unless you are three years old and like to watch random colored LED's blink on and off in the darken room.... because that is all it's good for! :-P"
5,Ava Goddess,"I am impressed with the dramatics,sets,settings and scripts and dialogues of the old classics and use those as a basis of comparison with modern cinematography that rely s on special effects and CGI. I am on a movie marathon usually,between my investigations of other subject matter, however bloopers do not slip by me unnoticed, but I do not expose them. Even bad movies, I mean really really bad movies, no examples forthcoming, even have something one can learn from.I loved it for too many reasons to list, but I note costuming,hairstyles,background furnishing,transportation, era accurate sets,architecture and get a real good feel for the setting, the story-line, but I don't do plot reviews, won't spoil the suspense.Enjoy."
5,Excellent Research Text,"I needed to write a biography on John the Baptist for class. I didn't think it would be so hard, but finding a good book on John the Baptist wasn't so easy. This is the best one I found anywhere. This is the most exhaustive text on John I found anywhere and it takes everything into consideration. I highly recommend it for research, but it is written so well that it is good for even a curious reader."
4,Nice pictures and some useful information,"This book is not an excellent source of scientific information on Oscars, but I found it a rather nice and very easy to read. There are a large number of good quality photos and some nice and accurate discussion on Oscars. As a whole this book is a compact infopacket on Oscars with beautiful pictures."
1,Unsatisfactory,"This translation was done by a scholar who is completely out of touch with what Taoism is about. Lao Tzu himslef would have laughed at the translation. The translator thinks that the purpose of Taoism is merely a matter of survival. Cowards survive longer, is his attitude towards Taoism. As a Taoist I have read many translations of the Tao Te Ching and this is the worst one I have ever read."
5,Covers the basics methods and ingredients of good cooking,"This classy reprint of a standard cooking guide deserves a spot on the shelf of any serious cook's collection: this edition provides an introduction by Julia Child and a foreword by Barbara Kafka as it covers the basics methods and ingredients of good cooking, with a healthy dose of Beard's philosophy added for spice."
4,Nice variety of routines,"I love Rodney Yee, and this one is a good sample of the variety of yoga routines he performs. Good instructions."
5,We read it at least twice a day! (And neither of us are tired of it!!),"We got the board book version of this story for Christmas for our boy who just turned 3, and it has quickly become one of his favorites. The rhythm and repetition have made it so he is repeating bits of the story to himself in his room after only a few reads, and he loves to shout out lines with me when we read together. I love the clever little protagonist. It's hard to find such a great little story for kids that also has such a wonderful cadence for reading aloud--both kids and parents enjoy this one even after dozens of readings. I have a feeling this will be a favorite for a long time."
4,Wonderful Book about Friendships,"I truly enjoyed reading this book.. The relationship these four women share with each other and with the Lord is so inspiring.. I laughed with them at their funny stories and cried when I read about the sadness some of them have had to share. You feel Peggy Benson's sadness at the loss of her husband. You share in Sue Buchanans triumph over breast cancer. You'll cry at Gloria Gaithers tender memories of her mother, and you'll enjoy Joy MacKenzies way with words. But mostly this is a book about friendships. You feel the love these woman have for each other, for their familys and for the Lord. Theres such a warm comfortable feeling between them all.This was given to me by my best friend, and I have to say it's such a wonderful gift for a treasured girlfriend. I could so identify with this book for I love my sisters in the Lord. If you do too you will really enjoy this one."
5,Off-beat and a REAL hoot!,"Two brothers have fire-starting capabilities; one chooses to live as normal a life as possible while the other chooses the field of entertainment to showcase his fire-starting talents. Things ""heat up"" when the circus comes to town and brings the brothers back together and they once again compete for the charms of the same woman. Clever story and Dennis Quaid's dancing to ""She's A Lady"" is not to be missed!"
5,I love The Tea Party!,Absolutely amazing! I can't get enough of The Tea party. This is probably my favorite album of theirs.You can see all of my live Jeff Martin/The Tea Party/The Armada footage here: (...)
5,excellent product!,Very well crafted and an excellent buy for the money. Finely appointed without the thousand dollar price tag. Makes for a pleasant compliment without taking away from the overall room appearance. Great quality!
4,Not the K2 remaster of 'Arrival',"This transfer to CD (VICJ-41698) is NOT a K2 20-bit remaster, but it is in a mini-LP sleeve. The other mini-LP for Arrival (VICJ-60790) IS a K2. VICJ-41698 resembles the K2 import, but the yellow side-sash uses a calligraphic rather than the serif font used on the K2 side-sash.You can find your way around these releases by looking for info at 'minilps' net."
2,Two movies for the price of one?!?!,"This direct-to-video release feels like two separate movies. Our heroes (the characters from the Robotech Macross saga) prepare to start a grand space expedition. In another part of the galaxy, an old scientist and his assistant fight for survival while giant space bugs (the Invid) invade their planet. The two separate stories never meet.This is four episodes of completed animation for a series that was canned during development. The footage is edited to make the two separate movies that alternate. There's alot of synthesizer music and recycled footage from all three Robotech sagas - another sign of the aborted production. If you want ""the sentinels"" story, pick up the ""Jack Mckinney"" novels. They go into more detail - and more importantly, they finish what they started."
2,Get the Slow Burn Single,"Don't get this single, get the slow Burn single, which includes both ""Shadow Man"" and ""When The Boys Come Marching Home"", but also ""Wood Jackson"" and ""You've Got a Habit Of Leaving.""Basicly, this single just doesn't make sense when there is a better one out there."
4,Nice!,Nice and simple and very useful. Sharp corners are covered by plastic to make it safer. I wish I could find them in the local stores easily!
2,hook too small,Was disappointed that the smaller side of the hook was too small to fit on my closet rod. I could turn it around but then there would not be a lot of space to hang things from the smaller side. Manufacturer should state size rod it would fit.
4,Lloyd Webber's Broadway songs,"This CD features many songs from the Andrew Lloyd Webber's plays andMichael Ball does a good job singing them, in addition to other lesspopular songs."
3,His Princess,His princess is an incredibly encouraging book. It gives excerpts from the Bible and it is also a collection of letter as to how God feels about us and His plan for us.I received this complimentary copy from WaterBrook Multnomah Publishing Group through their Blogging for Books program. A positive review was not required and the opinions expressed here are my own.
5,"A ""MUST HAVE"" devotional for every woman","""His Princess"" is such a phenomenal devotional. I have found it to deepen my relationship with the Lord. He uses it to speak to my deepest needs and provide diretion in my life. I have purchased several copies of this book to give as gifts to my friends and they all love it as well. Anyone I have known who has this book has been touched by the Lord in various ways. It is amazing to me how one book can relate to so many different people in different ways. I think this is evidence that the writer and this book are exceptional and that the Lord has annointed it greatly."
4,Pass it on!!,Within these pages you will truly find words of love and encouragement from your God and King. God sees us with such loving and forgiving eyes and He desires for us to see ourselves through His eyes. May each Princess find herself through this wonderful little book.My good friend and mentor gave this book to me and it has been a great encouragement. I have since given this book as a gift to friends. It is a book you will not want to keep to yourself - Pass it on!
5,Excellent!,"A wonderful book for all women, but especially those struggling with self esteem or acceptance issues. A lovely, thoughtful book for a gift."
4,Sweet Lorain!,"Michael Dirda is a cousin of mine, and I remember going to my local Borders to hear him speak about this book (and get a signed copy!) when it first came out. It was a treat to finally get around to reading the book and experience his perception of some of my relatives. Marlene and ""Cookie"" are my aunt and uncle and their sister is my grandmother, the third Kucirek cousin who is, unfortunately, not mentioned! I grew up in Lorain in the 90s, and it's amazing to me that not much has really changed. I can pinpoint nearly all the locations he discusses, and can vouch for myself that Yala's Pizza really is the best!! I consider myself more of a casual reader, so some of the ending chapters where he gives us more of his musings on authors and their works was a little dull for me. Overall, though, the book is a wonderful telling of life in Lorain."
5,Exactly what I needed!,"This item was exactly what I was looking for. I needed a swivel that was unobtrusive and could allow me to easily change the viewing direction as I moved from one part of the room to another. The product arrived undamaged (it was packed well) and there was no assembly. In a matter of minutes, it was in place. Love it."
5,Sansus System TV-LCBD Swivel Base,"This swivel base was exactly what I needed for my LED 37"" TV. It is very smooth and functional. It looks very beautiful under my TV and it belends with my TV. I am planning to buy another TV for my family room and I will definitely purchase the same swivel base again."
3,Philps cable,"Ends can not be bent on a continual basis otherwise ends fall off. If you are going to use cable where it is being bent, then you should get a compression fitted connector."
5,Classical Anglican Spirituality in a Heirloom Treasure,"This beautifully crafted Book of Common Prayer testifies to its durability as a source of classical Anglican/Episcopal theology and worship and is yet another fine example of Oxford University Press'craftsmanship. This edition sustains OUP's tradition of excellence both in binding and quality printing..in short, this is a book one just likes to hold. The elegance of the Elizabethan prayers and other contents make this prayerbook a classic for all Christians seeking the beauty of Elizabethan English and its poetic cadences and for those who seek also a deeper appreciation of the richness of Anglican spirituality.This is the kind of volume you and yours can appreciate generation to generation...it is a lasting heirloom, literally and metaphorically... a treasure."
3,Better searchability would make this more useful,"While it is nice to have an e-copy of the 1928 BOCP, it is pretty much worthless for use during morning and evening prayer, since the psalms aren't indexed electronically, so it is impossible to do a search. I'll keep looking for something better..."
1,DIRE,Can't compare this with the raunch 'n roll par excellance of Dirty Looks. This is pure crap. No wonder they only had 1-1/2 cd's. If you own a copy I suggest using it for a beverage coaster.
2,disappointing,"I so look forward to these annual volumes of BEST short stories. These collections normally have such a variety of subject and style. Not this volume. The subject of nearly every story was the alienation of immigrants in America. For the first time ever, I didn't finish reading the collection. I mean, I love popcorn, but want variety!"
2,One crippling feature for this stopwatch,"I'm in the Navy and rely on stopwatches to keep the submarine safe and prevent collisions with other ships. This watch, although stacked with a large number of useful features, requires the user to hold down the reset key for about 3 seconds before the stopwatch feature is reset to 0. This by itself has prevented me from using this watch except to tie it up in my rack and use it as an alarm clock."
1,Child murder,"Yikes! How could this YA novel come from the same author as the one who wrote the May Amelia books and the Boston Jane series? Although the adventure is fun, the violence and murder were too much for me. Even in an adult novel, I would not enjoy reading about a child murder. It was creepy when they were burning ants and killing cats, but the weird sexual attraction and over-the-top assumptions about who was dangerous and who was not became creepy to me.Pass on this one."
5,It's an orange colander!,My wife has Racheal Ray cookware and this is a great match. It said it was orange and a collander. It sure came to me without any surprises. She leaves it out to match the rest of her orange kitchen fun.
4,excellent trio with serious competition,"I wore out the lp version of #96 and 97, but had not heard the #94 before. The Eloquence sound helps considerably. The three symphonies are spirited in the outer movements and profound in second movements such as the variations of the great second movement of #97.. The booming tympani in its third movement still sound too tepid. #96 remains a perfect work- not a note less than exalted // the Mozart Quartet 15 and his piano sonata k332. But #97 is even greater, I think, a larger work and not qualitatively inferior to #96.Challenges abound: Jochum/LPO in 94 is peerless I think, and Davis/RCOA are close. Szell's #97 and #96 are still the best, trumping Davis and Jochum, but the Abbado COE version of 96 is also flawless (see my review) and this Van Beinum #96 is nearly so. 4 1/2 stars."
4,A very good read.,"Jack Ramsey is a very unique individual. This book wasn't all basketball, but the basketball stories were informative. If you followed basketball during his Buffalo days and then Portland I think you'll enjoy this. If you don't want a trip down memory lane don't bother but I recommend this for the older fans. They will enjoy the book."
4,Great Value,Ignore the review above....all Showcase titles are in B&W. It's nice to see DC finally coming out with their own version of the Marvel essentials.
1,Showcase Justice League Vol.1,"I'll keep it simple, the art is nice, but the stories are really hard to get through. I love the Format but the story telling is so beyond bad its like pulling teeth at times. These comics could have used a little more character period. The JLA members are like blocks of wood inhabiting a world full of would be world conquers from outer space. There is nothing here worth while as far as story telling is concerned. Unlike what Stan Lee was doing with the Avengers, it seems that DC was happy just putting out pointless empty fluff with its big team book. I have to say this was horrible and might be great if only for the nostalgia but nostalgia is suicide so don't. I love the Justice League and will continue to read the Showcase books and hope the next Volumes take a better turn with the Storytelling. But to sum up, nice art ,Great format, bad story telling. I love the justice league but this volume left with one impression LOVE HURTS."
2,"Hey,Its the other THOR,All BOOKER fans rejoice !","Starring: Richard Grieco,Kevin Nash and Patricia Velasquez.This film was on SyFy Channel as a premiere before its dvd release.Richard Grieco steals the movie as LOKI and really never gives it back,But for a few scenes when others shine.Patricia is Red Sonja-like,She has some nice swordplay and maybe the most dialogue.Kevin Nash as Odin,Has some brief stronger than strong early spots and then dies.Cody Deal as Thor,Is good and heroic...Cody comes off like young introduction to all the history that is MARVELous.The monsters that Loki/Greico conjures are most impressive and can do some damage on screen to our heroes and humans alike.The director of photography needs to take a bow,Some scenes were lit and atmospheric as anything produced by anyone,No matter the studio.Scenes of destruction from half a dozen Asylum films stock footage,Tsk-tsk."
1,Why in the blue HELL did they even bother?,"This film looks like they had the actors doing an improv routine from behind a bowling alley for the ""Earth"" scenes, and the other half they tried to cover up their shame with cheesy SyFy CGI!Seriously, did they even HAVE a script? I can't tell!Richard Grieco has the same hairstyle he had when he did 21 Jump Street and Booker...and he clearly hasn't taken any ACTING LESSONS since then!I say again: why in the blue HELL did they even bother???????!!!!!!"
2,Maiden tributes,Anyone looking for a Maiden tribute album that doesn't suck? Haha! Get Worlds Only Female Tribute to Iron Maiden by the Iron Maidens... these chicks can rock!!!
3,Good Cheap Travel Toy,"I bought this after reading the reviews but my daughter doesn't show alot of interest in it. We take it with us when we go out as it keeps her busy for a few minutes and gives her something to chew on. She could really care less when you put your fingers in it and the little spin dial is WAY to hard for a baby to manipulate. She throws it on the floor and out of the cart more than she really ""Plays"" with it, but we figure if she loses it she's not that attached and it was pretty inexpensive."
5,HAPPY WITH PURCHASE.,THE BOOK WAS AS DESCRIBED AND WAS PACKAGED VERY WELL AND NO DAMAGE. DELIVERY TIME WAS GREAT. SELLER VERY PROFESSIONAL AND I RECOMMEND THEM TO ANYONE. PETER P
3,"Nice Size & Weight, Needs Sharpened","First off, the knife is a great size and weight, perfect for my pocket so it doesn't feel like I'm hauling around a 30"" dagger. The serrated edge of the knife is actually quite sharp ... but the straight edge is just awful. The tip to the first serration is dull enough when I got it that I could drag it with pressure across my finger nail and not receive a scratch. About 10 min later with the stone and it's much better ... but I don't like having to sharpen a brand new knife."
3,ok,"Mine lasted two years of almost daily openings and closings before an unnecessarily narrow part of the metal piece on the frame that is the locking mechanism snapped cleanly. It's a flaw and they should eliminate the thinning of that part and make it uniformly thick to correct the problem of metal fatigue there. Other than that it's a pretty decent small, cheap pocket clip knife."
5,Perfect sized pocket knife,"This knife was purchased as a gift for my husband and he really likes it! He wanted a smaller knife that he could carry around with him, and this knife with its solid frame and blade was just the thing! I would highly recommend this knife to anyone looking for a small, everyday knife."
3,"Good blade, bad handle","The blade is very good, nice profile, nice point, very sharp, good serrations. I am not a fan of the handle shape or design. The holes are so large you can reach in your pocket and stick your finger into the handle hole and catch the front edge of the blade. I don't carry it so as not to risk a cut. I also don't care for the way the handle bends in to lock the blade open, it doesn't feel like a positive lock. The Bear Grylls series locking mechanism that Gerber also makes would be a better choice for this knife."
4,Better than a Case knife.,"Very solidly made little knife. I have the sog flash II and this knife is more solidly build, but certainly smaller. The blade is your standard Gerber blade. It comes duller than expected, but can be sharpened nicely. It has a very solid lock up with no play at all. If you love easily consealed, EDC knives on the small side, this knife is unbeatable for the price. I just bought the Case mini blackhorn for about the same price (less than a dollar difference), and it is not as good. The Case's blade is sharper and stays sharper as you'd expect , but other than that this is better."
4,Voice of reason,"The why's of keeping a well run house are articulated really well. Although one can live in disorder there's no equivalent to the feeling of relaxation that comes in a clean, uncluttered, well stocked house that has it's functional rhythms.I bought this book on a whim and it inspired a pleasurable, organised spring cleaning in the spring of last year (after many false starts in prior years..).Since then, have given it to friends who say they perenially feel they are falling behind their home cleaning and comfort goals."
3,very little comfort,"If you're looking for the ultimate guide to housekeeping, here it is. If you're a reforming slob, like I am, choose another book for advice. In the introduction, Mendelson's voice is kind and offers a wonderful connection between an orderly house and a peaceful house. Once into the book, however, her book turns technical and she keeps sliding in condescending remarks about those who aren't naturally neat and tidy as she is. You hear less about peace and self-satisfaction and more about perfection. That really turned me off. I quickly quit reading."
5,I Bought This With My Christmas Money,"I could hardly wait to shop on Boxing Day...for one reason..this book. I fell in love with it after seeing a 'spotlight' section about it on Amazon. Now it is the talk of North America. It is indeed the stuff your Mom should have taught you. Mine did, I just didn't pay attention. There is everything in here from food storage, to folding clothes (I desperately needed that page), to ironing and care of cds and videos. This is a must read for everyone who wants to 'make a home'"
1,SO glad I'm not alone,"I feel emboldened by some recent customer reviews that were less than favorable. I was disappointed in and frustrated by this book and thought I was the only person who felt that way. There is nothing comforting about this ""home comforts"" book, which is all about tedium and elbow grease. My family would rather have time with me, and if our home isn't ready for inspection every day, so be it. To be honest, the book made me angry and a more than a little stressed. If you're in training to be a Merry Maid, fine, but if you are a real person with a rich and wonderful life, then give your house a once-over every week or so and get on with your life. Just forget this book, because it won't leave you time for a life."
1,Something is Wrong Here,"I appreciate all of the research and pain-staking detail put into this book. However, I think this type of obsessive approach to home is most unhealthy and beyond belief! I kept the book as an example of how not to live."
3,Not quite inspirational,"The book is filled with information and encouragement, but the tone is too proper for me. I'm glad I purchased it, and I have changed my ways a bit because of the author's suggestions. An example - white sheets are easier to clean (it's true). Cheryl describes the ideal, the proper, the perfect, with a little bit of snobbery thrown in. Wouldn't we all like a nice tea and snack in the afternoon? Yes but where's the reality in that? I will use the book to define the stars I'm shooting for, but don't consider myself hopeless for accepting a little dust in my life."
3,interesting,"be careful to get the right edition. I got the British edition and it is not cute to own it at all.The author gets five stars for effort. Three stars is about my inabilty to focus on the material in it.It's interesting to have such a big book of insights even if you don't do things the same e.g. I line up matching socks and tie them together to make one fat knot like a garlic knot and I lay out my duvet as it would normally lie on the bed, then I place the inside out cover over the duvet as it should line up and running my arms inside the reversed cover, pinching the inner corners, I FLIP the duvet cover over the duvet, jump on the bed and hard shake the cover down over the duvet. Woohoo."
5,For those who care about making a house a home,"I had already done some reading about how housekeeping ""used to be done"" (there's a detailed description of Scottish housekeeping in Sarah Macnaughtan's A Lame Dog's Diary) and quite unexpectedly, the subject fascinated me. So when I found this book in a cruise ship library, I devoured it. Now I have my own copy. I find the author's advice, wisdom and perspective very helpful as well as satisfying."
4,"Useful book, but expect to feel inadequate","I very much respect what the author is trying to do here - bring back the art of good housekeeping. And I really learned a lot from some of the chapters. But at other times I think she goes overboard in what she expects is possible for the average working person to accomplish each week. And I thought I was germ-phobic. But next to her I feel like a slob. (Bleach, bleach everywhere! should be her battle cry) This book made me even more paranoid. But with that in mind, it's still a good reference book."
3,"Six of one, half a dozen of the other","After reading the other reviews here, I see that most people loved the book, a handful hated it, and no one is in the middle. Here I am. I really enjoy the book as something to read and learn from. However, I feel my heart and stomach clenching as I read about dust mites (they are arachnids? Oh, gross!) and raw chicken contamination. We're buying a 5 bedroom house next month, and if I have to dust the hardwood floors ON MY KNEES, well, um...NO. But, I find some excellent stuff in this book--airing the beds, food contamination, washing the doorknobs, phones, and switchplates, etc. I'm taking what I can PRACTICALLY use, and letting the rest bounce around in my guilty head.It's a great reference, but certainly not a blueprint."
5,Every Home Needs This Book,"This is a great book, for the working mother (like myself) and for the homemaker. I'm surprised at the reasons people give for disliking the book i.e. too detailed and tedious. It's a REFERENCE book, unless you like reading encyclopedias or dictionaries for fun, this is not the book you curl up with after dinner. It's the one you turn to if you're not sure of the best way to remove a cherry stain on your blouse. As for the working moms who sniff at the book because they feel their time is better spent with family, again this book is a REFERENCE. There is no person alive who could implement every suggestion this book makes. I've stayed at home and worked, and the simple fact is no one has the time to do all this stuff, but if you want to know HOW and WHY you clean you do, or should, the Home Comforts is an invaluable resource."
1,do not support this cd,"Buy all of the REAL TJT cd's. Not this one. TJT got screwed over by record labels, that's why they finaly gave up and quit. It's in the letter Brett wrote to all the fans explaining why they quit. Knowing all their cd's, I would NOT buy this cd, simply because, The band did NOT put this out. Everyone of their songs is awesome, and people who buy this cd, might think they have all that tjt has to offer, when they miss all the rest. Just my opinion, I think that you should get the REAL cd's, and not a cheap compilation of SOME of their songs."
5,"Yes, that's 5 stars","I'll keep it short. So many have avoided this simply because it came after the misfire of ""Cold Lake"". Don't be like them. This is only a hair beneath the first three releases in terms of overall quality. The crunching angular riffs are deeply satisfying and the odd tunings are put to excellent use. Once you give it a chance you won't want to take it out of your player for some time."
1,CELTIC FROST/VANITY NEMESIS AND THIS IS A GREAT CD BUT....,"THE DVD DID NOT ARRIVE IN THE CONDITION THAT WAS DESCRIBED WHEN I ORDERED IT WHEN IT ARRIVED I OPENED IT AND IT WAS ALL SCRTCHED UP AND IT KEPT SKIPPING ON EVERY OTHER SONG, THANX FOR NOTHIN."
2,some of it woudn't play,The films were fine. The dvd was flawed and I was very disappointed. I hope this doesn't happen again. o.k.
2,bad casting decision,"I'm a big fan of Hitchcock but this film just doesn't work for me and the reason for that is the casting of Cary Grant in the main role. In order for this film to work you have to be able to buy Cary Grant as a possible murderer. I mean, it's CARY GRANT. You know he's not going to murder anyone. As a consequence there's no tension in this movie at all because you know he's innocent from the get-go. Now if they had given Joseph Cotton the role things would have been different."
3,Not Hitchcocks best but still superb,Charming film with Hitchcock favourite Carey Grant. Great performaces all round and a nice cheap little film which boast much entertainment.
4,Golden classics,Loved watching the old bloc and white film. It was very well done and the film was of good quality. There was no revelation or grannies in the film.
4,entertainment worth seeing,"this was a very entertaining movie which transports you back to the days when the fate of the world falls into the hand of one courageous hero. here it is Captain Joe Sullivan or more formerly known as Sky Captain. He along with his co-horts are required to face the kinds of dangers that you just do not see anymore in the movies, Robots out to destroy New York, and evil scientists who have a quest for world domination. However, Sky Captain will ultimately save the day, definately a fun movie. If you were a fan of Flash Gordon and heros of the past, this is the movie for you"
2,Please kill Polly Perkins,"The movie was amazing, except for the character Polly Perkins, I am so disturbed by this character, That I have write this review as soon as get home from the cinema. Never see a lead lady so stupid that she should be the villain of the movie. If there is any sequel, please kill Polly Perkins. Any way, great special effect. It should be a 4 stars, but Polly Perkins just robbed the other two."
4,Fun ride through an alternate furturistic past,"WARNING- Spoiler (not plot, just character setting)Seeing Gwyneth as the wickedly secretive mischievous trouble-maker and Jolie as the one who always turns up to come to the rescue is a fun and different twist for these two actors. Jude Law, as always, is predictably unpredictable."
3,3.5 for a fighting spirit,"This movie soars mainly because of the interesting visual effects and its star power (namely Jude Law, Gwenyth Paltrow, and Angelina Jolie). A lot of the plot was kind of difficult to follow, but here's what I made out about the characters:Jude Law plays a famous pilot who's good at like destroying stuff, I guess. Gwenyth Paltrow plays a very dogged reporter who apparently has some kind of past with Law. Jolie is a pilot who seemingly had an affair with Law, which upset Paltrow.The best parts in this movie are when Law and Paltrow are trading one-liners. The last ten seconds or so of the film made me laugh hysterically.All in all, this is movie that has its hits and misses, and is probably worth seeing, even if some of the battle sequences seem a little unneccessary and long."
5,something new and old,"The movie was very good I thought the way they used an earlier movie style and blinded it with modern graphics was creative. The story line could have been better, but over all it kept me watching"
5,Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow,"Great movie, Super Special Effects. The extra features were very interesting. Must see for the Action/Adventure movie fan."
2,great special effects...bad story,"It would seem that having great special effects was enough. The story line was boring and silly, not worthy of great talent that was in the movie. The actors must have done it for the money. I'm sorry I bought the DVD, even thou it was used..."
1,Left out the good parts,"Sky Captain is obviously the product of a unique vision. I had no problem suspending disbelief, but the movie did not elicit any emotional response.Further, I found the main two characters to be irritating and non-sympathetic."
2,Bitter Nastalgia,"The director of this movie apparently wanted to create something that reminded us about the old Science Fiction theater days. However, all it did was remind me of why people don't make movies like this and why Science Fiction Theater 3000 got many laughs from an implausible plot and horrible acting. The sad thing is... this seemed intentional.If you are looking for something different from today's science fiction, this might be for you. If you are looking to see what science fiction used to look at, you might like to take a peak at this. If you tend to like the direction science fiction is headed and don't want to look back, skip this movie.I fit the in the last category and wish I hadn't wasted money on this rental or the time invested to sit through it all."
3,3 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:After a spectacular opening, Sky Captain devolves into a disappointingly routine movie that is still (barely) worth recommending due to its intriguing visuals and nostalgic feel."
3,The scent is ok...,"The scent of this cologne was ""ok"", I wouldn't replace it when it's gone. Slightly disapointing compared to the other ""LeMale"" versions by Versache."
5,cures insomnia!!,"This CD is wonderful for insomniacs like myself. Since listening to the CD before bed, I have never slept better and recommend it for people who worry and think too much."
4,22 year-old Lt. Lord Ramage outwits mutineers & pirates,"In this, the 3rd of the Ramage series, Lt. Ramage is given command of the brig Triton whose crew is involved in the great fleet-wide mutiny at Spithead in the spring of 1797. His orders are to carry dispaches to the admirals off Brest , Cadiz and then to the West Indies. How does he set out to sea with such a crew? Then in the Caribbean, he is instructed to stop the mysterious loss of ships sailing from Grenada to Barbados after frigate captains had failed. There is an interesting discussion of the economics of the slave trade in the 18th century.I find I re-read Pope's books more often that the smiilar books by Forrester, Kent or O'Brien. Pope always gives a good tale."
2,An unnecessary remake,"I was very disappointed by this version of Monte Cristo. Depardieu is everywhere to be seen, yet he doesn't really play Dantes: he plays Depardieu. Additionally, he as fat as ever, even though he is supposed to have spent 20 years in prison, with only staled bread to eat. The very day he escapes from prison, he doesn't even have a beard. Maybe he had his own private barber in prison...Even the direction is really uninspired. Josee Dayan is really not a great director. The scenery is mostly flat, and the camera is very static all the way. To add insult to injury, they betrayed Dumas in their changed ending.Not everything is bad though: for example, Jean Rochefort plays a very good Count of Morcerf.In the end, this is a poor remake, especially after the many cinema adaptations. If you want to see a much better version, turn to the 1955 version by Robert Vernay, with Jean Marais as Edmond Dantes, or Claude Autant-Lara's 1961 version with Louis Jourdan as Dantes."
4,Refreshing and engaging. Worth the time!,"One of the frequent complaints against filming classic tales, is that the film-maker did not following the authors vision. I will beg veiwers to remember that film is an art, just as writing is an art. The film-maker and the crew are working to convey an impression of another artists' (Dumas is this case) art work.This version of Le Comte.. is no exception. I feel the vision was fresh, engaging and fun. Depardieu is excellent, as always. Ornella Muti, as Mercedes, is ravishing and worth 20 years in solitude! It is easy to see why, in this interpretation of the tale, that Mercedes is the ultimate revenge!Good music score and costumes complete the film. Very good quality overall. I enjoyed the transitions and flash backs. I feel more flash backs would have added much."
2,Not Duma...,"I have not seen any other versions so cannot compare them but I have read the book many times between ages 9 and 12. Despite the fact that it's been 30 years since then, I remember virtually every word and without a doubt every scene. This film reflects a desire of the director/screen writer to leave a track in literature more than attempt to pass the spirit of the book onto the viewer. Many key scenes are not included - I understand that it is impossible to include the entire novel but... - while many scenes/characters have been invented for no apparent reason. For example, at one point, Mone Cristo gets invilved in romantic relationship interrupted by arrival of the Ali's daughter. It's a totally unjustified fantazy - it does not show a new twist in character of the hero. Actually, it damages the idea of Count's preoccupation or rather obsession with his mission which Duma had managed to emphasize. Excellent actors, poor movie! Sad."
5,GO YANKEES!,As a die-hard Yankee fan this movie still ranks way at the top. The story and the acting along with the fact that Babe Ruth himself appears in it makes awesome. Lou Gehrig was one great baseball player and it is sad he died too soon. A great movie for ANY fan of baseball.
4,The Greatest Movie on Earth,"Pride of the Yankees has been my favorite movie of all time ever since I first saw it at about age 14. It is a fantastic story about an era in baseball and Canadian/American history that gives you a feeling of nostalgia even if you were not alive then. I give four stars out of four for the movie and I give zero stars out of one for the color version. You must see this movie, but you must see it in black and white. I refuse to buy any more colorized versions of originally balck and white movies."
4,What's not to like. One of the better baseball movies,"(& I'm a Yankee hater). You have the great Gary Cooper in peak form, Mr. ""boy next door"", & an oh so cute momma, & oh so cute poppa. Theresa Wright is hot & even ""The Babe"" is thrown in. This movie is done with a lot of pathos & we know Gehrig dies, but it is a reel classic. You can hardly miss it as it's on cable very often. It was done shortly after Gehrig death. It's too bad ""The Babe Ruth Story"" done shortly before Ruth's death could not have received such fine treatment."
5,Excellent Movie!!,"Pride of the Yankees is one of the best baseball movies ever made. It shows what a great person Lou Gehrig was, on and off the field. Whether you're a baseball fan or not it's a must see. Gary Cooper and Walter Brennan, along with Babe Ruth and Bill Dickey, are great."
4,not bad,"i thought is was just ehhhhh, some good stuff, but did'nt last long in my cd player.i prefered Live at Newport."
3,Too short,This book is OK but I wasn't blown away. There are a decent amount of recipes that are pretty similar. I was hoping for more diversity and a lot more techniques. I don't think I would buy this book if I had seen it first.
5,I love this little pickling book!,Lots of fun and quick recipes. Great reason to explore all of the unique grocers in Southeast Michigan to find all of the ingredients. I really love the ginger-honey-lemon recipe to make my own ginger ale.
5,A superb commentary on Canada - U.S. culture & politics.,"This is an extraordinary book dealing with the pervasiveness of U.S. culture in Canada, and how Canadians have seemingly allowed their own culture and politics to be subsumed into American versions. Although written from a small-c conservative point of view, and in the 1960s, it remains an extraordinary book that will intrigue any person interested in Canada and US relations. In addition, Mr. Grant is a gifted writer; his fluent use of words in a serious political work such as this one, only accentuates his poetic capabilites."
1,THIS BOOK WAS TERRIBLE!,"This book was terrible. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME! Sorry, but there is no other word for it -- TERRIBLE!"
3,"Not great, not bad","It's not the most complex of plots and not a lot of challenge in the story, but this is an enjoyable read. It moves quickly. If you are in the mood to just pass the time and read about some bad guys trying to make Christians look bad and the story that ensues, this may be a good choice. I am glas I got it from the library and did not buy it full price in the store.I'll be on the look out for the next in the series. The most enjoyable art of the book was the thoughts it has raised in my mind of comparing today's world to some of the things happening in the book."
2,"This is NOT ""Left Behind""....","I am a big fan of Tim LaHaye, so it kills me to have to write this review of ""Babylon Rising"". The plot line is implausible, the characters are, at best, two-dimensional. So much is thrown at the reader with so little effort to make the characters likeable or even realistic. At first I expected ""Indiana Jones meets the Book of Revelation"", but it reads like an old B-grade Hollywood serial.My disappointment is palpable - I so looked forward to this book!I recommend everyone to read ""Apocalypse Dawn"" by Mel Odom instead.I won't be reading any sequels in this series."
4,Fun and action packed,A little disappointed in the books editor - numerous proofreading errors noted!Overall a fast reading action novel with bibical truths mixed in. I do plan to read all the books in this new series.
2,"Left Out, Not Left Behind","I am an Evangelical Christian Believer and read all of the Left Behind series. Bablon Rising was quite a disappointment. The relic searches were too easy and too much time spent with the evil villans. This is just a teaser to read more in the series, with no idea of how many books will be coming to reach a conclusion.The editors were lax...on page 20 of the hard cover editon, it states, ""Murphy kept a touch light on the accelerator..."", which should read, ""Murphy kept a light touch on the accelerator...""Also, on page 231, first paragraph, the biblical reference shows II Kings 18:23, should be II Kings 18:4.Tim LaHaye is a wonderful person and author, but he did not get the help he needed from the coauthor or his publisher.Before spending $26 on the next book about Ararat, I will check the Amazon.com reviews."
1,Babylon Ain't Rising Here,"What a disappointment. Now we know who did the research and who did the writing with Left Behind. Where are you Jerry!? Oh, yeah; writing ""Soon"". Come on Mr. Lahaye, if you're going to write a book for a Christian audience, you should treat us with the respect we deserve. The plot lines here are fantastic! The writing is atrocious. Example:A woman with a crushed wind-pipe swallows a pill. Our hero shoots a falcon out of the air with a bow and arrow. A woman stops murderous cult members by screaming a twenty-five hundred year old language at them (what!?), and my favorite, Nebuchadnezzar calls Daniel ""Daniel"", not Belteshazzar. Helloooo?Get some help, Tim. This has the potential to be a great series, but you need someone to take off the edge."
1,What a waste of time,"I should have followed my instincts and given up on this book after the first chapter.It really is not written very well, the plot is lame, and the characters extremely one dimensional.The book doesn't really finish. It is continued in the next book in the series (Yet to be written).I for sure will not be reading it."
3,Not a happy owner,"The fence is the best part of this table, although the face of the fence wasn't perfecly square to the table and needs adjustment. However the worst part about this table is the router plate, which was not flat in the first place and sags to become even worse when a router is attached. It was virtually impossible to get the plate to lie flat even without the weight of a router causing the cheap plastic to sag. The ability to fold the table for storage is useful in a small shop like mine, and despite folding legs the table has been stable and secure. All in all if the router plate wasn't junk and the overall quality control a lot better, this could have been a contender."
3,CAR SEATS,MY CAR SEAT JUST ONE OF THEM HAVE STARTED TO COME UNDONE! I HAVENT NOTFIED THE COMPANY YET. BUT THEY ARE SO NIECE I REALLY LIKE THEM.
2,"goodnight ,goodbye irene","THE WRITING WAS AVERAGE AT BEST.EVERYTHING HAPPENS IN THE LAST 50 PAGES,AND IT ENDED VERY SUDDEN.JAN BURKE IS NOTHING COMPARED TO THE GRAFTON'S,CORNWELL'S OR EVEN PATRICIA MACDONALD.SHE IS VERY AVERAGE."
4,Heavier than I thought,"I enjoyed reading this book very much. But I do not agree with the reviewers who say it does not require more than a highschool level in mathematics.I have an M.Sc. degree in electrical engineering, so I can safely say I have a good knowlegde of mathematics, but still there were parts I didn't completely understand.Maybe we don't have to understand it all at once, maybe this level is needed to keep it interesting. And interesting it was, right up to the last page. And after reading the last page, I would have loved to read more like it."
3,Oh Poo!,"These really let me down. Just so people know...they are actually black (not like natural black pearls). They are dyed. So, if you were hoping they'd be dark grey with purple like real black pearls, you're out of luck. If you want BLACK pearls then by all means pick these up. However, they were great about accepting my return."
2,A Train Wreck of A Production,"As I actually worked on the production of this film I was genuinely surprised to find it for sale on Amazon.com As far as I know, despite our contracts, no member of the crew was ever paid for her work on this film.Having said that, while the script attempts to tell a genuine story of a young woman finally growing up and and older woman taking a last chance on love, the film is hampered by a lack of depth and a shallow approach to character development."
3,"average songwriting, good performance","This album is a rerecording of their original full-length demo, and it shows in that the songs are generally not particularly inspiring. I can't name a single outstanding track (Although I do like the really high vocal on ""Frozen Candle"": ""BurNIIIIING!""). Sammet's voice can be annoying: his vibrato is particularly broad and can be disorienting: ""Flyiyiyiyiyiyiiiii""... Nevertheless, this album is heavier than ""Theater of Salvation"" and is not plagued by those annoying Meatloaf influences. So if you thought ""Vain Glory Opera"" was godly (I wouldn't rate it that high myself), and that something slightly worse would still be great (I would rate this merely ""good"") then you should definitely shell out for this one. For the rest of us, this will be a more marginal purchase."
3,80 original eurovision hits,I couldn't see the listing on ad. so I took a chance. It's ok. Most hits are there but not all. I wish at least they select the best ones for DVD. DVD selection is pathetic.
5,Primary clutch Puller,Excellent price and quality. Used it 4 times already to remove the primary clutch on my 2010 Brute 750. I'd recommend this to anyone.
4,Rock n roll!,"This is the import version of 6Twenty by the D4.It came out before the U.S.A release but they both are almost identicle.There is one less song in this import version and its more expensive than the U.S.A version because its an import so I suggest you buy the newer,American version of 6Twenty.This is still one rockin' album that is very well worth owning."
4,Nice Change Of Pace...,"Dont get me wrong, I love the whole pop punk/emo thing...ALOT, but after months of nothing but bands like NFG and Rufio, I needed a change. My friend let me listen to ""6twenty"" one day on the way home from school in his car and i was amazed at how much power and energy was on this C.D. The next day I went and got myself a copy for only 7 bucks (even though it's well worth more) and to this day I still listen to it. It's Pure energy without a dull moment to speak of, and from the first track, you'll be hooked. True, there aint nothin on here too ground breakin lyric wise, but for the music, it totally kicks a**..."
2,Skip it,"This book was highly recommended and the person was so enthusiastic about their recommendation, I ordered it the same day and read it as soon as I got it. After reading it, I'm wondering if there were kickbacks involved with the glowing recommendation. It was a good story, reminding you what's truly important in life, but it didn't life up to the hype."
2,Le son est chiant.,Ce film est remarquable sans doute. Les acteurs et actrices sont comme il faut. L'histoire est tellement bien présentée. Malheureusement la qualité du son est carrément de la merde.
3,A gripping political drama,"I was 19 and it was 1970. Z was an incredibly important film in my life. In 1971, I spent a summer in Greece, holding my tongue, while Army officers in bars explained how they had been trained in the United States. I had my first experience in Greece of not being able to freely speak my mind. We Americans cherish our ability to mouth off in the local tavern, even if we can't do it at work. I make references to everyone being at the Bolshoi to this day. Incredibly powerful. Z. He lives."
3,works,what can you say its a cord and am able to move the bed against the wall now so plug is out of the way shipping was fast and it didnt break the bank.
4,Works great but not a surge protector,I know it doesn't say it but I kinda expected that this would be a surge protector given its size. It's not. Still works but I had to add a surge wall wart to protect my electronics so kinda defeated the low profile feature I was hoping for....
5,Does the job,After using a massive 3900 maH battery for a few years it was a breath of fresh air to lighten the camera with a new and smaller battery. This does what it should and charges relatively quickly.
5,Classy songs that just make you want to DANCE!,"I grew up on Taco when I was younger and some of my favorite memories are from singing ""Singin' in the Rain"" in the rain. I let one of my friends listen to it and she loved it, once she listened to it another did. All of my friends now LOVE this charming tape!"
2,Bad writing,"I was interested in reading about Alaskan culture. The story was intriguing, but the writing was awful. Really made for an unpleasant read. The conclusion of the story was not worth the pain of reading to get there."
4,Fringe leather jacket,This is a beautiful black leather jacket. The detail beading and fringe is well done. It made a wonderful gift.The reason for the 4 stars is as follows-The pockets have a leather flap around them that looks out of place and the closures detract from the richness of the jacket.
5,An Unexpected Song,"Having heard ""Tell me on a Sunday"" and ""Take That Look off Your Face"" from Andrew Lloyd Webber's ""The Premier Collection"" I have always wanted to hear the complete recording by Marti Webb. Now it is a dream come true: Ms. Webb's subtle, emotional, and believable performance in ""Tell me on a Sunday"", is flawless. The music is terrific, the lyrics by turns pensive and comical (though some British references may be hard to catch); Disc 2, ""Variations"", retains the electricity of the live recording, and the finale ""When you Want to Fall in Love"", is a special treat: it was re-written as ""An Unexpected Song"" for the Broadway Cast Recording starring Bernadette Peters (another wonderful album)."
2,An eclectic collection of greeting cards...,"This is really an odd book. On the one hand, it's filled with some very lovely photos of some quite interesting greeting cards. On the other hand, there is no attempt made to identify the artists or publishers of the various cards. So the book is really rather useless as a reference book of any sort. But the photos are very well done, the colors bright, and if you know what you're looking at it's an interesting view at the collection of someone who managed to get theirs published somehow (it was published in Japan.)But don't buy this book if you're thinking of using it as a reference, as there's no info there to which you can refer."
1,Get the illustrated version - do not buy this one,"How annoying to buy a book about the Ernest Jones Method, only to find that no effort has been made to either format the book into a readable shape nor have any of the illustrations been included. Get the illustrated version. This classic is well worth reading."
4,Liked Adored A Lot,She writes like Jackie Collins. LOVE IT!! Hope she keeps writing. Might even try her sister's books. This is more my style.
4,"Not deep - but good, easy beach read","If you are looking for an deep character novel - look elsewhere. If you are looking for a good beach book, this could be the one.The main character is easy to hate/love/hate/love (you get the picture). Predictable? Maybe - with a few twists along the way.After I finished the book, I did not wish for the time back. Actually, I finished it wanting more."
3,Average and kind of boring,"I picked up this book looking for an escapist read. Based on the book's description, I expected that if anything, it would lean towards the sleazy side. Instead, I was surprised to find that I was actually pretty bored.The story line should have been fairly intersting, but I was never in a hurry to get back to it and find out what happens next. I kept reading for lack of other book options, but I definetly wouldn't call it a page turner - not even a decent ""shallow"" beach read.Overall, I felt Adored just lacked spark and energy. The best way I can think to describe it is like a soap opera narrated in a journalist style - the characters and plot line were scandalous, but it lacked juiciness. It would be like a New York Times writer submitting an article to a grocery store tabloid - mismatched.Overall, it's a decently interesting read, but ultimately pretty forgettable."
5,One of the best books on selling in recent years.,"Getting Into Your Customer's Head stands out from othersales books because it offers one of the best systemswe've seen for identifying potential customers, acting asan advisor during the buying process, and making surecustomers remain happy after the sale. And the systemcouldn't be more ethical, because salespeople using itnever need to push anyone into buying.We look at 1,500 business books each year; Getting into Your Customer'sHead is one of the best."
3,Often Overlooked,"A excellent CD of an overlooked revue-style musical. Although the recordings are excellent, the overall quality of the show cannot be realized without seeing it...the disparate songs don't make sense otherwise."
5,The Witch Returns,"For anyone following Phyllis Reynolds Naylor's ""Witch Series,"" this book was more than I could hope for. It was cleverly written to bring Mrs. Tuggle's evil back, and was a great way to end the series. Except, I hope it's not over yet!!!"
4,"Lots of good life lessons, Could have been more polished...","I think many of the reviews that I read here have missed some of the main points of the film, and this may be why they rated it so low. The story line of the main character, (played by Chatwin - the only other film in which I have seen him act is the rebellious son in Steven Spielberg's ""War of the Worlds"")nearly dying from a beating, and then becoming a ghost ""in limbo"" is actually just the framework upon which the deeper points of the story are built. These points involve issues of understanding other people's lives, (who may be much less fortunate than you), compassion, forgiveness, justice, and redemption. These aspects make the film much more serious and mature than a simple ""occult thriller"", and perhaps not as ""entertaining"" as the movie goer was expecting. There were some technical and editing difficulties that I noticed, but overall, I found the film very moving, humanistic and compassionate."
5,"I WAS SCREAMING ""HE IS RIGHT THERE!!!""","This is one movie where you are going to find yourself liking the criminal as well as the victim. My whole family sat down to watch it and everyone was drawn into the movie and screaming at the intense scenes. In fact, everyone that I know that has watched the movie has loved it, so I am not understanding the negative reviews on it. I can't even think of a single complaint about it, I loved the entire movie and found it to be powerful emotionally. Watch it and judge for yourself, hopefully you will be as moved as I was."
3,The QUALITY is Invisible,"The second I received the movie ""Invisible"" in the mail I was instantly happy. However, upon watching it, I noticed that several parts were absent from the DVD that I KNOW should have been in it. [This is one of my favorite movies.] I would suggest buying elsewhere, unless of course, you've never seen it before. Then you probably wouldn't miss anything TOO important. However pivotal the missing parts may be, I keep it on my shelf and laugh at the thought of it."
2,Dont get jipped,I love this movie but this is the first Blue Ray I've seen that actually removed scenes from the movie. The version thats shown on TV is actually longer and better. They did a terrible job making this BlueRay
4,Great Music.,"While not quite as good as their first album (All Eternity) this is still very good. Someone described this band to me as a mix of Duran Duran vocals and Metallica guitars with a little Depeche Mode synthesizers. That description is not bad, but you will be disapointed if you expect the fast pace and crunching rythms of Metallica. That said, this is still a wonderful mix of heavy metal and 80s style new-wave music. This band seems to have everything it takes to hit it big. I fully expect this band to be HUGE in the near future (at least in Europe, if not in the US)."
5,Awesome,"This is a great CD. If you like HIM, The 69 Eyes, etc, check this out. Best song on the CD: Track 9 - Immortal Lovebtw, it's 10 tracks and 74 minutes long, but thats only because the hidden track has a 30 minute instrumental of the same riff / chord / whatever it's called. That's kinda dumb, but the cd's still awesome."
4,It works,"It definately reduces recoil, no feed problems of any kind. It doesn't open the heavens and suddenly your holding a pillow... but that doesn't exist yet!"
5,One of the Best Cowboy Christmas Stories Ever,"This is one great Christmas story. I first run across the story in 1980 when it was aired on a public TV Station in Denver.It is a must for any die in the wool Buckaroo, Hand, Packer, Wrangler, Cowboy and of course any cowgirl.Don't pass this one up, for yourself, your children and your grand children.They don't put pencil to paper like this very often ."
5,An Excellent Compilation,"Being a former resident near New Orleans for 40 years, I always loved the music of that city. Since retiring to the Philippines, it is even more appreciated now. The message of ""Sing Me Back Home"" can act as a rallying cry to those that left after Katrina. Both the artists and the songs were selected to portray the vast culture of New Orleans. The CD is truly a musical gumbo of styles, and there is something in the pot for everybody.Ron Nethercutt, DirectorCenter for American StudiesAngeles University FoundationAngeles City, Philippines"
3,Golf Ball Golf Club Cleaner,The item arrive on time and was in good condition. The item itself is very nice. How to mount it is another matter. This should be just as easy to mount on a cart or in your garage but the items used for mounting this device are of poor quality and don't really work. I will need to come up with a way to mount this in my garage.
1,leaks,This was a hunk of junk and I should have sent it back right away. Had a problem with the water tank leaking and messed up my wood floors in a spot before I caught it. JUNK!
5,Superb collection of Catlin's paintings,"This is a wonderful book! It accompanies an exhibit of hundreds of Catlin's paintings held in Washington DC in 2002, and scheduled to travel to several other cities. The reproductions are superb (the best I've ever seen) - the colors are true, and the sizes are often full-page and sometimes double-page. A brief commentary accompanies each painting, and there are also lengthy essays describing Catlin's life, his time in Europe, and his connection with the Smithsonian.I bought Letters and Notes on the Manners, Customs, etc at the same time that I bought this book, and I read the two of them together. The paintings are immeasurably enhanced by Catlin's comments and stories (he is a great story-teller). He explains what's happening in the crowd scenes (and it is sometimes hair-raising!), and he gives interesting background on the people shown in the portraits. Looked at in this way, the paintings really come alive. Very highly recommended."
1,"It promotes Shiasm, NOT Islam","I bought this as a gift for somebody. But before delivering it to the kid, I wanted to evaluate and check it out if it is accurate or not.It has two major, I mean very major problems:1. It promotes Shiasm2. It depicts Prophet Muhammad, angel Gabrial. Angel Gabrial is depicted as sort of tiny weeny angle, like doll, with a very unimpressive voice. Anyways these depictions are not allowed in Islam.The quality is terrible. It is just moving pictures. Not the type of animated movies that you usually see."
3,It's ok but unrealistic for a real person.,This book has minimal recipes really. Alot of the stuff in there is truly high carb netting 5 grams or more per serving. Lots of breads and muffins but there are only a few recipes per category and the food in the recipes is stuff that is not typically in your grocery store.
3,It's OK....,"Some of the recipes are absolutely fantastic... if they only call for items you can purchase at the local supermarket. Unfortunately, this book has several recipes that call for Atkins products which are no longer being produced. Even the Atkins website is no help as to what to substitute. This book should probably not be sold anymore. It's very disappointing when you can't use half of the recipes."
3,I want to give this a 1 and a 5,"I gave it three stars because most of these recipes are fantastic and warrant 5 stars. I only gave it three stars because many of the recipes call for ingredients you cannot get any more. They sell the book as fully revised, but they have not updated the recipes to reflect either the current market or their current product line. The good news is that some of the ingredients have been reproduced and can be found on the web (in recipe form only). The bad news is, they are not exactly the same as the missing ingredients.If you buy this you will make some mouth watering food and be glad you bought it, but you will also be very frustrated broken recipes.For the record I have about 5 low carb cookbooks and it is common to find recipes built on ingredients you can no longer buy -- my beef with this book is that it's sold as ""fully revised"" which does not apply to the content, but rather to the copyright."
3,Meh. Read the book instead,"Another lazy, middlebrow Miramax movie for the elderly liberal demographic, complete with an obligatory gratuitous mention of George (H.W.) Bush. Only Miramax could succeed in making the story of the Hughes autobiography scam seem less interesting than it actually was. The book by Clifford Irving is vastly more entertaining."
